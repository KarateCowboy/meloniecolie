Im grateful for people like you who stand on the front lines and shine a light on the insanity of topics like this. God bless you  melonie
they cant tell you what a woman is. they cant tell you what a man is. yet they will give you an award for being one or the other or both.the circus is no longer limited to three rings.great stuff melonie  God bless.
I really miss the 90s. imagine explaining gender ideology to the people during that decade. they ll throw you in an insane asylum without hesitation
several women were included on the list for men of the year. undeniable proof that we re living in a real life simulator.
pretending to be black is cultural appropriation but pretending to be a man isn t sexual appropriation  just trying to understand the rules.
let s not forget how much she says she enjoys playing women and how good she is at it...
our first mistake was thinking gq ever had integrity. your halloween costume was fire by the way
imagine if gq made their man of the year award based on taking responsibility  generosity  competency  reliability  integrity . you know  all the shit that being a man used to be about.
if I identify as a horse  then can I get recognition for being the world s first talking horse
this is why I will never waste my time with this show no matter how much everyone praises it.
what s going to be crazier is when she actually  wins  man of the year
nothing you said was wrong. bravo to telling things like it is melonie. more people need to do that and push back against the insanity. then it will stop.
clown world!!!! great video melonie. we re here for ya.
I gotta say queen elizabeth iI was the true man of the year this year. but the manliest man of all time is jane austen
makes as much sense as those folks who think men can get pregnant nice video melonie. lol gq....
just imagine how far they would take this if we played along.
should ve been given to paddy considine  he carried the entire show with his performance.
I seen the story this morning and couldn t wait for ur vid on this. keep standing up for the sane mel! I feel like they re trying to make us hate everything hollywood.
what is the world coming to... I have no words lol thank God for you melonie for having common sense with the rest of us who do!
tq  community in a nutshell
sent this story to a swiss assay office. their verdict was  ja  ist rein honk.
@harbl99  what does that translate to
@kristov_tv   yes  its pure honk.
and correct me if Im wrong  but didn t d arcy identify as female when cast  I know I saw the early hotd articles using  she .
@harbl99  hahaha thats awesome! I love it.
gq-smoke major drugs and do crack before this article-check
for everything else  mastercard.
oh ca ol children c vik c a vil
so tired of these afabs
hotel  - trivago
Im glad this happened makes more republicans every day
aka 2022 in a nutshell.
looks like john conner after listening to marshall mathers lp-check
no no no! not clown world  clown america! the rest of us are still a bitsane!
brilliant
she s even pretty!
you canthank the tiny hat tribe.
people who say  clown world  are pdos  be careful. I know youre dumbly repeating your talking points but please stop defending pdos on your other accounts.
this is getting beyond ridiculous. thankfully they keep going with this and the normies will take back our world. by force if needed.
lmao
films herself explaining to us simple folk how its  actually quite simple  - check.
two of the rings of the circus fused into an infinity symbol years ago.
they cantell you what a man is.   the oppressor
good times. biology was simpler and could make random love without going to jail for fake accusations afterwards. also no social media bulluying or cancel stuff.also good music.
yes  I remember going to college in a super liberal college town and the local city council passed some pro gay law and the whole  liberal college  community went nuts  it was a step way too far even for liberals of that era and they were forced to revoke it.
the first rumblings of all this were present even back in the 90s. we all thought it was nothing but absurd intellectual parlour games for academics with too little to do since communism imploded.
pat was a recurring skit on snl 25 years ago.
100  clown world  get bent gq.
back then they might even  uh... knock on the door of a certain type of  healthcare  clinic or government building with bang products.
@harbl99  yea  most of this isn t new  but it was a festering mold in the darkest corners of california universities in the late 80s and 90s.
yep!
@martianwoodpecker  yes  making fun of this crap.
you win best comment
amen to that. the 90s actually recognized mental health issues and didn t claim insanity was normal.
@heikira  this. and to be fair  early 2000s were sane enough as well - an extension of the 90s really. I had and have my challenges so to speak . it was acknowledged. but it wasn t celebrated and that was  nice. I see younger folks celebrating when they get diagnosed with something and it just feels weird.  they gave me aderall  yaaay!  it is  incredibly odd to celebrate for being drugged. I do have my meds. I have never celebrated getting them or being diagnosed. I try my best not to take them by adjusting healthier lyfestyle choices into my routine. its a thing and I deal with it. end of story.but nowadays  they put their issues out there as if the world was their therapist and celebrated being drugged out of their minds.
hell Imiss the 2000 s
who knew that 20 years later  the asylum guys from good burger would become the  good guys
even the early 2000s which was 90s with an extra 10 year delay
it was in the 90s.  it was part of that whole yale thing.
yes because society was so much better when racism and closed mindedness was the norm.
@eris eden  I love how my comment has nothing to do with race and thats what you decided to write down
@martianwoodpecker  emphasis on skit  now its not even a joke anymore. its still funny  but yk not a joke lmao
its a love hate relationship for me. on one hand  people are right that the 90s were less tolerant. I dont think I d want to live in a world where youre thrown into an insane asylum right away for trying to explain the idea. however  at the same time I dont want to live in a world where youre cancelled right-away for disagreeing with it  either.
its where these people belong.
@onering  thats exactly what you implied though. you miss an era that was hell for people who weren t the  norm .
@bob  so whenever someone strictly talks about only gender ideology  we have to always assume they re also talking race  that makes absolutely no sense. that d be like whenever someone talks about dogs  we have to automatically assume they re also talking about world war iI  because we have to make up far-reaching correlations between two different topics
@onering  gender and racial standards can be compared because they are both extremely oppressive and are commonly associated with the same groups. like black woman being oppressed for being both black and a woman. see how they go hand in hand even when they re both race and gender  so again  by saying that you  miss the 90s  when people were being literally bullied to death for being different is weird and wrong.
@bob  hahahaha! well  obviously gender and race can be compared. no one is denying that. but sadly  you like to purposely avoid logic by arguing about things no one is talking about in this particular case. here  I ll break it down barney-style just for you. so here s how it went down  my friend. Imade a comment talking about only gender ideology in a video that talks about only gender ideology. youre with me so far  okay  good.now  there s no piece of evidence in this video or in my comment talking about race in any shape or form whatsoever. you see the difference  no  well  thats too bad. here s another analogy youre just going to dismiss anyway. people dont go to a math class to talk about chemistry. but you can make the comparison that both subjects deal with equations. but that doesnt mean its appropriate to talk about science in a math class. but in all seriousness your comment made me laugh hysterically. hope you have a good one.
@onering  youre right im about to dismiss this one too  your analogy didn t hit again because science is just as interchangeable as math and I remember quite a few times where they have been mentioned in their respective classes and it perfectly aligns with the task at hand. so back to what I was saying once again  friend! when you say you miss the 90s  thats exactly what people interpret it as. you want to go back to a time where it was the norm to bully. I ll be here all night!
@bob  I dont see what the sixth sense has to do with anything but okay. someone seems desperate
@onering  thats what you said no  they d throw people with different gender identities in an asylum and you miss that.
@bob  one flew over the cuckoo s nest was so good  they dont make movies like those anymore
@bob  broccolI is a lot like chicken
@bob  staples and tomatoes
@onering  is everything ok at home
@bob  Imade a random correlation between two different topics and disguised that as validation for an irrelevant point to hide the fact that I lack any legit arguments. sound familiar
@onering  my thing is why couldn t you just say that in one paragraph instead of @ing me different comments three different days  anyways  youre still wrong regardless if the comparison was relevant or not. boohoo
@bob  I bet you bring everyone so much joy whenever you leave the room. not to mention  there are some remarkably dumb people in this world. thanks for being my prime example. I genuinely appreciate it
@onering  I know you are but what am i
@bob  you are the human version of period cramps
with glitches as norm
@iron kore  Im trying to opt out of the beta testing and go back to the last stable version but cant quite figure out how.
it annoys me that it got patched in as part of the main game  instead of making it an optional free-l-c
the simulators cpu power was lowered. queue that rick and morty episode.
anybody find that unlimited gold glitch yet
@austin wyss  I think that was called be a senator do insider trading
its not a bug  its a feature.
nope society is about to collapse. this all has happened in our history before.......
@joven c   it identifies as neither a bug nor a feature  plays bugs on tv  but would like to go on the features of the year list.
yh they can do that with women of the year  cuz they technically did that to themselves. but men of the year  bruh gtfo lmao  notice how they just sneaked it in as nominee while dylan is gonna win woman of the year.they know what they re doing lmao.3 yrs in a row woman of the year has been a man. 3 years ain t thatsome shit
thats the fun part... there are no rules
save your own sanity and stop trying to figure this shit out. its arbatrary at best  complete bs at worst
@kr43he  I was being sarcastic lol  yeah  stopped caring a long time ago. I completely agree.
@damemeLord  the rules are whatever the higher member of the progressive stack claims
lol  its what happens when rules operate on circular logic.
@robert mcdougall  even giving it the argumentative fallacy of circular logic seems generous.
@samuel aritan  true
its simple. the rules only apply to the people that dont comply and they change in accordance with their needs and desires so that they never benefit.
@tim smith  bruh fr  sodom and gomorrah  rome  greece.....america. Imean u luv 2 see it
the rules are that  you will always be wrong and the trans movement will always be right.
there s neI understanding because they change every week
rules are for phobics.
@thevideonorm  lol
@thevideonorm  being stable  healthy  and positive is phobic.
trying to understand is hate speech. apologize now lmao
@rambleon07  yup b4 it was black ppl  then women  now the fruity bunch  next would probs be aliens lmao
@e.king5897  welp
rules are phobic and racist  you bigot!  - twatter progs
@itamaro93  ah snap
absolute insanity and crazy crap and its funny how she says she likes playing a woman because she damn well is one

I died when that happened.
its almost as if she has first-hand experience at being a  woman
well it is 2022  logic and consistency are so 90 s.
they
c mon  it is a bit of a stretch..
well its not hard to imagine since she is one
I wonder why that is
Imean she speaks the truth
she didn t dress like fire at all!
@kim salmelainen
I d give it to leon edward s for killing the ceo of epo
am down with that. I ll be the only living dragon until others realise they are dragons too
go with that man  maybe you ll get an award
ed was first
@iron kore  as dragons  it is our personal right to hoard gems and precious metals without paying for them.
mr. ed beat you to it.
I ll identify as a very rich man  which I am not  but now I demand money from everyone to be rich as identified.
could make ya gluey
@moric  I identify as a billionaire. still waiting to live my truth.
@abbagil  be careful what you ask for  here on earth .
exactly
I watched it. apart from some good acting  I dont see what is so great about it.
I watch shows like this on  alternate sites  so Im not paying for or giving views to garbage.
hotd just feels like dlc for game of thrones. I feel like people are overhyping this show because its in a culture war against rings of power
same here  I cant support that weirdo shit in any way.
it is ok not great  the reason many think it is great is because it is being compared to current year absolute crap like rings of power  she hulk etc so it looks great in comparison.
@nathan evans  pirating itstill benefits them. these corporations monitor a lot of these pirate sites to see how popular their content is. this was how the american anime manga industry operated in the 2000s so they could figure out what titles to license.
@nothing0  thats mostly all the entertainment. you would be surprised if there a movie show or game without the woke culture war stuff in it.
@aicw  this is still happening today with japanese properties anime or otherwise hence why black sun was released internationally for example
they had a great rhaenyra and recasted it her with he she whatever mid season. the first actress was much better imo.
@rambleon07  this isnt a robbery  just a re-appropriation of funds. -fellow dragon
imagine not watching a show because you dont like the actor lol
the show is actually fantastic. no wokeness. her being like that isn t touched. its a very well written show.
people are loving itspecially because it is seen as a worthy rival to rings of power  which is trash of a much worse kind than hotd.
it does have some woke messages concerning  the patriarchy  but it falls well within the source material and has actual mea lning to the story
even without rings of power coming out at the same time house of the dragon stands on its own. its even better then the original games of thrones in terms of quality. I think people need to be able to separate actors from the production they act in.
@ocir   no it doesnt.
@mr mann  without putting any arguments forward that is an empty comment
@ocir    hotd is definitely on the fresh side of the tomatometer  I agree. but its far from a masterpiece of writing  and has too many flaws.the woke agenda that it promotes is only one of its many flaws  and its not about the actors  its about the choice to cast them in the first place. we have black velaryons and a non-binary protagonist  and the feminist discourse permeates the series. its everywhere.hotd is better than game of thrones  last seasons  but is not better than its early ones.
I wasn t gonna watch anyway. game of thrones lost my trust years ago.
my friend made me watch the first episode. the  bad guy  targaryen and the new dragons are cool. but yeah  0 plans to watch episode 2.
@1chasg  there s plenty of wokeness in hotd
Im at the point where I just dont watch shows that cast characters purely for progressivism  especially with how nonsensical it always is. you d be shocked how much more enjoyable my time watching entertainment has become.
@nothing0  there s definitely not  plenty  lol. some people like you try too hard to find it in everything when its not even there. give me some examples if there s  plenty .
this stuff doesnt bleed into the show though. her character is a woman and thats the end of it. shows great.
@nathan evans  arrrrggggghhhh sail the high seas
@nicholas moon  the person who wrote the  source material  is why I wouldn t watch it  even if I subscribed to hbo. if an author walks away from a series without finishing it  I walk away from the author.
@hugo ferreira  feminist discourse  it was the entire point of the book  the only reason why rhaeneyra and rhaenys weren t accepted at first was because they were women.
@aicw  and commenting and liking videos that have anything at all to do with house of the dragon is still supporting the show and making it more relevant because youre so busy talking about it  even if its on an outrage channel.
@outbobthelaw  the book isn t feminist for basing its main plot off a medieval law of succession. it is just accurate for the time period represented.the series is feminist because it makes itseem like the characters involved had a 21th century mentality and cared much about women s rights  constantly telling the audience that men are bigoted and afraid of female rulers  and making rhaenyra into a heroine because she represents feminist ideas and is fighting against a male who is denying her rights  when in the book she is as much a villain as he is.also  the series contradicts itself for the sake of arguing that women s claims are always the right ones. rhaenys  claim is based on her birthright  and rhaenyra s is based on the king s will. both cant be valid at the same time because king jaehaerys appointed viserys his heir in his will  disqualifying rhaenys. the series never acknowledges that and instead makes both into female victims of male greed and prejudice  when in fact aegon iI is the one who got his right  stolen  by rhaenyra.in fact  most of westeros was loyal to rhaenyra despite her being a woman. in the end nobody cared about her sex when the war started.
@1chasg  its great. but for God s sake why cant actors keep their mouths closed. this kinda nonsense can ruin a good thing and for what !
@hugo ferreira  a feminist discourse that is set to disappear if events play out in the show as they do in the lore.
the show has nothing to do with it. its pretty good I think. dying publications like gq trying to pander to insane people on twitter is the real issue. I never knew nor cared about thatstuff before they brought it up  and it was not something relevant in the show. I assume them publishing this type of stuff is the only way they manage to keep some type of relevancy. soon enough  they will just die out.
your loss
@shelby  I will try to carry on.
show is meh. no one is missing anything by missing it.
@john durham  okay
I never knew so many people refused to do things just to enhance their own sense of superiority
he better post his best deadlift right after.
@ben molina  he better have a more masculine name than emma
thank you so much  _   3
@melonie mac go boom  always
its just gonna get worse and worse each dang year but I do have hope for beautiful future for my future kids and wife
as they said on blackadder... every author these days is using a female pseudonym...jane austen...  jane austen s a man   of course. a huge yorkshirman with a beard like a rhododendron bush.
its like asking someone every hour   when is the grass going grow   in his land when is freaking winter time
lol pretty much
well  it is 2022...............              too much crazy is never enough.
@james goodman  this is true
@james goodman   your not wrong
Imean someone like mo farrah who despite coming across as likable is on there but has a long list of inconsistencies from the history of his immigration to the uk to the multiple missed drugs tests during his athletic career that are suss af but gq ignores all thatsimply cause he is apparently a  refugee  and became an athlete despite  adversity
@superbatmanbro1902  exactly
ate up every scene and left none for the other cast members. though credit where its due the two younger queen s weren t far off from being top shelf either
paddy decent actor  part was dumb. his character couldn t get much more obtuse and oblivious to everything around him.
too late!
same and all I can do is laugh and laugh and cry and at is bull crap and make a bowel of popcorn
the award is called  men of the year   but it has historically been honoring both men and women like serena williams  jennifer lopez and megan thee stallion. even this year has myha la herrold and marisa abela amongst the honorees.
reminds me of dave chappelle s bit about caitlyn jenner winning woman of the year her first year after transitioning
thank you melonie. a lot of sense about several subjects in a single video!
we are really living in a clown world. what you said about the soy really stuck with me though and now Im paranoid  gonna start checking what I buy more carefully from now on.
its like half the world went insane keep doing you youre amazing as is.
guy from squid game should win. that whole cast was amazing. every single one of them.
I feel like kif whenever zapp opens his mouth in futurama whenever shit like this happens
just discovered your channel recently. good stuff! thoroughly enjoying your content. keep it up.
yo Im glad that youre resilient. for real  most people crack at the sight of the social media mob  that come out from the wood work to try to make you feel miserable for your different opinion. a lot of people change their stances when faced with this adversity. you  however  stand your ground and truly own your beliefs. you may never fully realize just how important that is in these times... its inspiring to see  and can help others find their own strength in their own battles. so anyways  thanks  and stay strong.
luckily the show isn t plagued with this nonsense like many other shows are. its very well written and is without the woke garbage thankfully.
showing off the guns    yes  I agree on the agenda part.
if they want to post you up in your halloween costume. I say  let them. that was awesome costume of death from sandman comic .and you cantell . youreally put the work into it.
yeah. you are 100  correct on the agenda.thats why society has become attack of the clones where these freaks all look the same  but are somehow all  individuals .itstarted out a bad parody on saturday night live  then turned freakishly into real life.
melonie for woman of the year
I love this girl! Im so glad I found her channel. literally agree with everything she s ever said.
1984 is here  buckle up! its gonna get bumpy. cheers
not enough people cook their own food. bread is so easy to make. especially with how expensive everything has gone lately  it just makes sense.
its a little ironic to hear this story while looking at the modern day helen of troy. melonie is a beauty you d fight a war for
just saying all these things out loud on such a public forum like this. you are genuinely one of the bravest people I have ever known.
the frog in the pan analogy is spot on.  and the heat has been turned little by little for the past several years.  I dont know if we re at a simmer or if the boil is starting to set in  but the frog is comfortably happy right now.I have been identifying as tony stark iron man  pre-death  for many years  but nobody is giving me billions of     and a flying suit made of nanites and wild metal alloys.
fyI a lot of chemicals act biologically like estrogen pseudo estrogens  so its in our food and water  that is the likely culprit with the crash in male fertility
@dean firnatine  does filtering water help reduce those chemicals  I just checked some stuff I have here and holy crap its in everything  insane. I never knew. its called  soy lecithin  but same thing I guess.
dont worry about it honestly.  like most things soy is 100  safe when consumed normally.  you would have to eat exclusively soy for months before experiences negative effects... eating exclusively anything for months is bad.
micro-plastics that are in the food supply now  all through the apex fish like tuna  salmon  etc  confuse the body and are often treated as estrogen. this is from webmd  bisphenol a  bpa   for example  is one of the more infamous endocrine disruptors. it is used as an additive to make plastics more rigid and can be found in any number of plastic products  though areas of concern have been plastic water bottles  baby bottles  and the protective coatings in canned foods. bpa may mimic estrogen  the female sex hormone essential for reproduction  neurodevelopment  and bone density. in men  estrogen regulates sperm count  sex drive  and erectile function. bpa exposure has been linked with   but not proven to cause   multiple cancer types  adhd  obesity  and low sperm count. most everyone has some amount of bpa circulating within their blood  but microplastics may retain bpa as they degrade  potentially increasing our exposure  leading to its unwanted consequences  says dusza. and bpa is just one of those 2 400 substances of  potential concern.
I was dwayne johnson cuz its about drive....
its pat!
nah nominate jeremy from thequartering  we cannot allow women to feel human
honest to God
yeah Im horrified about the future
thats 1984 and the twilight zone combined
yup  people should be cooking 90  of their food at least imo. it has made a huge difference since I started doing that
just eat raw beef  with some butter.
@oscar l.  yep  my tapeworm sure helps me stay slim!
@flyfishermanmike  very beneficial for your health  them worms. you wont be getting any fortune worms from beef muscle meat though.
to arms!
well done here melonie  takes a lot of courage to go against what is becoming the  normal  way of thinking
makes perfect sense  my female cat  jinx  was man of year last year.
keep it up !!!  you personally broke some of my stereotypes about gamer girls with tatoos  -  I like you !!!
on the plus side  this means you yourself should be a shoe-in for next year. go get  em  dude! lol
I read the books years ago  and it was so good. the author never finishes the series and allowed hbo took over the shows....
I was googling the women on that list  I thought it was an unfunny joke but after seeing the second name is who I refer to as sex swapped samuel l. jackson slj twin sister I laughed until my sides hurt.
thank you for making this subject clear as mud. hahaha keep up the good work.
never a fan of gq myself but this story reminds me of the direction playboy went when they put the he-she thing on the cover.  I expect this to work out about as good for gq as it did pb.
reminds me of fathers day being co oped into second mothers day.
yeah  I totally agree that all this non-binary and identifying as other pronouns is so silly!!! the fact that we get disrespected or cancelled if we disagree with their point of view and are polite about it. body shaming for trying to be healthy.  this place is more upside down than ever.Im just tired of the attempt normalization of delusional ideology  division between social  political views  individuals getting offended on my behalf of others or on my behalf due to my skin color gender culture religion. why ! ! I dont understand.
world needs more people like you who have an actual brain.
it is odd that a woman from a tv show series is making a man of the year list on the magazine which she is not even a man  anyway how relevant is that how women like her makes a award on a man s magazine for a man of the year award which she is not a man but she is a woman. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout this topic of this video and I just wanted to tell you melonie that you are doing a fantastic job with making videos like this for your fans like me and everyone else who is following you on twitter and on your melonie go boom youtube channel. anyway way to go melonie and congrats to you too. hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today with your parents and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too.
I love how you throw it back at them. never back down to those freaks
my wife is an absolute sweety  and for the maybe 6 months thatshe was on the pill  she treated me very differently  and it was bizarre. when she stopped taking them  she was back to her old self almost immediately. Im pretty against hormone treatments in most cases. for example  if you extrapolate this for a girl whose baseline isn t as nice as mine  you get some real hormone driven nonsense. dont mess with your body s equilibrium.
yay!!!! hey melonie
melonie for everything you do for your incredible wonderful channel.
melonie trying to pronounce names.
the babylon bee has officially peaked
looks like we need to expand the award categories to include  they of the year
if anybody can be nominated to be on the man woman of year list why not just make it the humans beings of the year list at this point and call it a day  well then you know what  we can have a non-humans of the year list too but that opens us up to alot of nominees. I will gladly call you whatever you want to be called but I do not have to understand it or agree with it. love you mel macs    keep goin boom
thisss! the select few times I tried hormonal birth control  because doctors told me it would help endometriosis  I turned into an emotional wreck  skin issues  and hormonal issues worstened. getting off that garbage and going carnivore  keto resolved all my issues
your videos are brilliant... keep exposing this nonsense
in the 90s  gq did popular issues with  women we love   men of the year . it was listicles  but in print form.since nothing means anything anymore  why not just do  person of the year   or gq can just disappear into obscurity like the discount vice it is  vice is already discounted  and your costume was adorable. I dont know what it was  but you look great
Imade the dragon of the year award. thank you for all the congratulations.
wait gq already has a woman of the year list as well   if they want to mix sexes in the list then make a  person  of the year list!
first time in the feed. coolest thing  apart from the amazingly based commentary  is the needler from halo leaning on the wall. keep it up.
the wig never fooled me I just knew she was like the way she is in the real world
dee-yikes  gq might as well be called tin man   if only I had a brain
d arcy took ahold of this role and never let it go  showing us who rhaenyra is in all her contracdictions and complexity she s a princess in the show  the only contradiction is her being a woman on the men of the year list.I dont watch the show but I wouldn t be surprised if she becomes the next king because   contradictions .this absolultely killed me! just wanted to kick back after my 20km run but end up in an ab workout from a laughing fit.https   youtu.be shfsx36y1ua t 533
if they are allowing this  I propose melonie mac as a counter offer for man of the year!!
its a good show so I watch it no matter what these fake actors screech about off screne because the industry needs to know we like this quality.  mac the show is incredible.  the inside knows and this will help to change the future for all our shows.. woke is packed and moving out.
if the ends up on the iron thrown then she deserves to be man of the year. until then  she can be on the list.
I love the - you need to educate yourself! - line!
dave chappelle would love to have a word with this.
this agenda is scarry and disgusting as hell. if you tube had an award show  this would be voty  video of the year  and eye opener of the year. Im 1 000 000  with you melonie.
if the world doesnt agree with you  thats the biggest sign youre doing something right.
so glad they put you in my recommended videos. a voice of reason and common sense  I ll subscribe to this.
I had a roommate with a subscription to gq back around 2007 and I would flip through them.    funny  because he was a heavily tattooed  chain smoking  hard drinking  jeans and t-shirt kind of guy that one might not expect to read something called  gentleman s quarterly   while I am a 3 piece suit   wingtip wearing chap that one might expect to read it  but I remember it being boring trash even back then.   now that it has gone completely woke and forgotten its purpose  I wonder who is actually keeping gq in business. my best guess would be trans-men and non-binaries looking for examples of masculinity to emulate... they are clearly looking in the wrong place.
to be a man of the year you should have to show your selective service registration card.
your halloween costume was dope
the problem  I have not watched house of dragon and I have never heard of emma d arcy from anywhere other than a few youtubers mentioning house of the dragon videos so what makes them worthy of such an award or title  from what I hear daemon was a more popular character anyways
I saw you flying overhead a few weeks ago and I literally cried. it was the best day of my life. best dragon ever!
harry styles will be woman of the year.
who or what is preventing gq from creating 100 more categories  such a joke! hope their sales suffer.
let s be honest  how much canthey really say about the latest cut in suits every month  they re going to start staring at the walls and just typing stream-of-consciousness nonsense eventually.
the show is wonderful.  the book is written and these assumptions about the character are silly.  the female characters in hotd are in no way hero characters. they do terrible things  make tragic mistakes  and happy endings will not happen on this show.
wo-man!
thank you so much  bless
good one sir
melonie  I actually started checking even the low carb taco shells  and found out they have soy. all the health info you share has changed my life. thank you.and Im sorry for angering you on twitter.
matt smith should have gotten it .. he did the best acting on thatshow
it makes perfect sense. she was the first female actress ever I actually thought was great.tbf  adult alicent was amazing aswell.
the only list I take seriously is my grocery list.
these brave men should all be drafted if war breaks out  we need good men on the frontlines.
its impossible to make sense out of pure insanity.
I like how these same people that would scream to high heaven at a slight criticism  would fall apart if their actions were turned against them.
it doesnt matter what gq decides because as men we know thatshe isn t a man and thats that  cant wait to see how much this blows up in gqs faces
its times like these when I recall the wise words of professor hubert farnsworth   I dont want to live on this planet anymore.
as a nurse in training  soy doesnt do all that much to the body if taken in moderation. secondly  Imay be an exception but  I have been exclusively using soy products when I started my weight loss program  lost 120 pounds  gained a big amount of muscle  and Ive become even more masculine in my mindset and tendencies. I dunno about the effects of soy on the general public  but Imay just be built different
call it the  self-gratification awards
thanks for fighting this insanity! at some point  history will look back at this time when humanity lost its mind.
to bad the award system and the world goes insane  because  she  emma gave the perfect performance for the show....she should get awards for the acting and nothing else.
melonie I love you and every bar of butter you munch on
lol ngl  I love the way melonie talks
I thought it was weird when kaitlyn jenner made  woman of the year . now its official. we ve all gone insane in america.
next series is called  game of genders
melonie your the goat thanks for this
ok at this point you ve gotta be running out of pearls to clutch
this actually sucks because her character and the way she plays ranerys in the show is fucking perfect. she is portrayed by everything she hates in real life I guess... in the show she is my favorite.  now I am bummed.  I saw thatshe was a newtard..  but I did not know she was insane. lol
yup for real! I used to eat more pre-packaged keto stuff like  keto bread  or  keto ice cream   but I quit because of the soy and seed oils they put in them o_o also you didn t anger me on twitter  idk why you d say that lol
I love the actress she was in a movie called pixie its a good movie must see I saw it on paramount plus or if you have spectrum watch it there
they are both great. all the actors on the show are.  I think king viserys should get an emmy
this is like talcom x being nominated as chinese person of the year.
okay Im about to put keanu reeves on woman of the year. we already know he s going to win so it ll piss off everybody
they could just rename it  human of the year
cant speak for the other female sounding names  but ashley walters is a guy  aka asher d  rapper name   he plays dushane hill on the excellent british crime drama top boy. big fan of him  I dont care about gq at all  but hopefully he wins since he is a real man and a very good actor.
great point about the soy in foods. pretty much where the term soy bois comes from.
this is why aliens wont talk to us.also  why
I read your tweet  and I have only one word facts!!!straight up!
is emma d arcey trolling the whole world
Ive got a four year old son and it constantly terrifies me to think he s going to be brought up into this mental world they ve created. no wonder kids are so f@   d up and mental health in teens is soaring exponentially...bring back the 90s
you are absolutely gorgeous and I appreciate your reactions.
Im suprised they actually included leon edward s on the list but he should win for killing the ceo of epo
I just gotta say  the very start of the video 0 00 is the face Imake when I read the article.
I wonder if their was a real man of the year award I would be glad to have a nation wide tournament of fighting like bakI or dragonball the winner gets that award
they should be creating their own categories.
Ive given up on trying to make sense of things. the world is so far gone right now
dont worry about those people telling you to  unalive yourself  melonie. probability is not on there side. lmao
wiseman says   there s plenty of other fish in the sea me   fn weirdo catfish throw that back..
paddy the bad daddy better be on women of the year list.
honestly  Im seeing a pattern where organizations that were on the radar of no one are trying to get on a larger radar with this behavior.  forbes  ulta  gq... etc.  who cared about those brands prior to them playing with gender roles and trying to stir up controversy   I remember gq was a bigger deal  when people looked to gq as the representation of the elegant  classy male but that hasn t been the case for a number of years  now.  they alienated their original audience  failed to find a foothold in the  modern  audience  so now they re trying... this   Im torn between wanting to know about the lunacy and giving these people too much attention.  it is  after all  what they want.
I wanna make the one of the humans of the world list
these people arent humans
yeah  we were all joking who knew these humorless crazies would take itseriously.
in all fairness  this is all still pretty recent - chances are it hasn t been around long-enough to actually influence mental-health statistics yet.
men dont get much recognition and even here women take what s supposed to be theirs!
keep fighting the good fight mel! dont let these twitter twats get you.
one of those shows we ll stop hearing about in a month.
this is why we cant have nice things.
id vote for melonie to be man of the year
aww the doggie  in the background so cute
I legit have no idea what they re getting at when they posted a picture of you looking like a goth. what does  worry about yourself  even mean with that picture  what are you supposed to worry about here
stunning and brave
melonie  if your parents aren t interested in cutting out carbs have you considered getting them a good bread maker   it would at least let them control what goes into their bread.  just a few ingredients like flour  salt  yeast  butter is all they need.before I gave up carbs I used one all the time.  so easy to measure out a few ingredients  pour them into the machine and hit a button.  then you just wait a few hours till its done.  not as good as giving up carbs but its a start.  less processed carbs is at least better than highly processed carbs.   d
as soon as I get my bottom surgery everybody s going to see my roast beef curtains
everything you say is common sense truth.
and to think it all began with the phase  you can do and be anything
fuck me why did I start reading the quote retweets. dont let them get to you
its gq.to be fair  gq have had women of the year  which is fine.but their annual best dressed men of the year lists have been...suspect of late.
there is no reality anymoreeverything now is all just screams
translated  - celebrities are ridiculous and should be ignored. they follow a different lifestyle than ours  they have a different financial condition than ours. they dont let us get close to them. why consider them so relevant in our lives    does not make sense!!!p.s.  great content!!!
oh the quote tweets you got were hilarious.
the best men are women and the best women are men. what a strange world.
I would like to see gq s sales number. it is probably super low already and getting even lower
loved the alex jones flash
it will never happen I get it but man I love this woman
gq is such a meme now.
emma d arcy is non-binary and uses they them pronouns. at first  I figured that this was part of the reason gq chose to include them on its  men of the year  list. however  the list also includes several cis women  including bad sisters creator sharon horgan and underground railroad star sheila atim  who once upon a time was going to be in the cancelled game of thrones spinoff bloodmoon  fyI .
logic doesnt exist in clown world and the clowns on twitter are the worst of the worst.
telling me to unalive myself. ...I just cant...
this is fine so long as gq include men on their woman of the year list
there s somethin in those trees  and it ain t no man.
keep preaching melonie
I just found you and Ivery much enjoyed that thanks
voldemort and powder s love child identifies as many things  but the most egregious one is an actor. its like watching an alien in a skinsuit trying to fit in.
2022. a woman winning man of the year isn t even shocking. the response it got from me was a tut followed by a little sigh and then a chuckle.
Im subbed to see the dogs in the background. look at them good doggos
come on man! we dont get shit anymore! I feel like Im getting divorced and the world is  taking all of my stuff. fine. keep it. will look nice on the mantle of my house you get to keep
I dont know what s scary in today s society  the person who just wakes up and decides to call herself a man or the people who just accept that like they never learned biology or common sense and I think she looks beautiful as a woman by the way.
Im 38 and society these days makes my head hurt
the emperor has no clothes.
keep it up homie - this nonsense needs to be pointed out.
Im going to feel bad for the actual men when they all lose.
you are so right on this
holy shit!!! gq is still around
well Imean... there was a certain celebrity that got woman of the year after killing someone in a hit and run
the story is factually incorrect. milly alcock  sp  was the actor everyone fell in with the role. they did a time jump that brought her in. they cant ignore reality. they replaced a loved character with a non-binary  whatever she feels she is and when that happened at least for me the show went downhill slightly.
so.. she can pick whatever she likes  man  woman  doesnt matter why not get man and woman of the year at the same time  that would be so stunning and brave!
if calling emma a girl is phobic to her  why is calling her a man not  oh wait  it gets her attention. thats why
in that case I would like to nominate ryan reynolds and elon musk for woman of the year.
didn t babylon bee get banned for what gq is doing unironically
the male 2 stars of house of dragons matt smith and paddy considine
future generations will look look back on today as the age of mass psychosis. dont worry though the end is near  rationality will win in the end starting tuesday... good luck to my friends over the pond.
she was actually so likeable at the role that for the first time sth woke is happening that I didnt rly mind  and obviously it is a woke move cause men of the year awards goes out to a woman who goes by they them so the mental gymnastics arguement here is that  non binary means she can go by anything  I guess which includes he him I guess. in the end im just glad they didnt push any woke propagandas in the show and so long the actors irl they dont act like the she-hulk actress where she hated on fanbase and men  then this will be a prosperous show
seeing all that hate and personal attacks you get on twitter  and Im sure that you get in dms and such  is pathetic. I know things like that can get to you  even if you put up a good front.as such  I will combat those comments by saying you are beautiful. it is a breath of fresh air that there are free thinking  intelligent  beautiful women like yourself out there pushing back against woke nonsense.keep doing what you do!
Im trying for motor trend car of the year award. wish me luck!
thats just gq taking the piss out of time magazine.
my 2 fave awards  type a of the year and type b of the year.
love the blackpink shirt .
maybe itshould be called  seamen of the year   cause they ve all had seamen
I used to think the modern world is all about mediocrity. I was wrong. its all about being nothing and still being rewarded. its not gonna end well.
what a time to live in smh lol
question are there any males in the woman of the year awards at gq   why not just do a person of the year award list and just drop the men and women part
dont forget that gq once named stephen colbert  bad hombre of the year.
she is a woman she have a time of the month is thatsimple.
you should be able to at least get a jd.powah award if nothing else. Imean they just make those up.
yesss! thank you for noticing  d
isn t putting someone on a man of the year awards who didn t identify as a man the entire reason the babylon bee got suspended on twitter  but... they do it and its fine
this is why lao tzu left people behind  and disappeared riding a water buffalo into the sunset. people were mad back then  and today still people are mad.
remember when gq was a mens fashion magazine that makes sense  tell me your desperate for relevance without tell me your desperate.
apparently gq has been including non-men on its list of men of the year for a long while   folk like jennifer lopez  jennifer aniston and megan thee stallion have all graced the cover   so the choice to include d arcy isn t quite as groundbreaking as I first assumed. still  the honor is well deserved
well  isn t a particular  admiral  the man of the year per the babylon bee
independent they them who dont need no man!
gq is super-woke. its been pretty easy to ignore them except for the occasional laugh.
God I hope the chick wins
they had to put something controversial on the list to get anyone to actually give a damn about anything gq related.
gq is trolling  there s no other way to make sense of this.
I always wondered why that actress looked so strange to me  and now I realize why
where does itsay she has to be a man     in the title man of the year
I swear  we are living in a real life episode of south park  mixed in with the movie idiocracy . what a crazy simulation.
we live in demonic times. Imiss your Bible verses and thoughts but I still tune in sometimes.
all Im saying is  if that person doesnt identify as male or female  how and why are they in a man of the year   I feel like they want people to be like action figures from back in the day like  taking the arms off of he-man and put them on barbie or snatch off prince adam s head and put it on one of those bratz dolls or something  its just wild
if you lose yourself  they will tell you what you are. if they tell you what you are  they will tell you what to believe. if they tell you what to believe and you actually believe them  they have controlled you.
wait  so they put your halloween costume up as an insult ......ok......
I swear to God this a us problem. in the 3rd world gender identity is not an issues. there are better thing to worried about.
identity issues aside  it does seem strange to give an   of the year  award to someone who just came in partway through a 10 ep tv show  and who thus arguably wasn t even one of the reasons said show became a success.
they re trying to turn us all into the goo backs from south park.
totally agree!
serena williams has also been nominated people are way to quick to judge up on the hate train without understanding that this isn t something novel or  woke .
in the word  man
with your logic  I can be employee of the month at wendys  since it doesnt specify that I had to be an employee at wendy s.
keep up the good dieting melonie  youre so beautiful its ridiculous. Im a really fit 6 2 and 250 pound man. maybe I should go into women s boxing... so you know  I can be a hero and get on that woman of the year cover on some woke magazine... haha j k!really though  its amazing how they glorify men beating the absolute crap out of women in mma and then turn around and also glorify women for saying they are men... I feel like Im living in some sort of nightmare. just amazing how crazy the world is today.
in related news  the rock got female of the year for his performance in black adam.
its not a conspiracy. its very simple. they could easily choose to simply change it to  person of the year . instead  they intentionally keep it as  man of the year  and knowingly include women. there is no other way to interpret it. blatantly not a conspiracy  its right there in front of you.
them puts woman on man of the yearnormal people  excuse me wot crazy  stunning and brave
Imean I did like her portrayal of rhaenyra.
personally I dont exactly understand the non-binary and gender identity stuff too much. my personal belief is that biologically there are men  women and intersex people  so who since birth have body characteristics of both  and thatshouldn t be even questioned. I get confused though when biological sex defines social roles and gatekeeps one sex from doing things another sex does. I personally think that when a person feels the need to change sex in order to be able to do things another sex does  then the issue lies not within sex  but within gender roles and social pressure. no person should feel to be forced to do operations in order to enjoy a different lifestyle. that being said  I find the whole men of the year list a complete trainwreck. not only it promotes focusing on sex  but then it also tries to hide it    make it make sense. itshould be just people of the year and nobody would get mad over it. in the end I dont mind what anyone does with own body because it doesnt harm others  so I dont often talk about it  but this time I just felt the need to rant for a bit lol.
as shitty as this year has been if we re going by this list then leon edwards kinda does deserves man of the year for that head kick ko of usman imo.
still makes more sense than joe brandon in the white house
I will accept this only if the rock gets on the  woman of the year list.
like a some eloquent man once said  confusion of the highest orda
she s not a man. wtf
speak out about ur beliefs values. let the ppl who dont agree with u go find an echo chamber they can feel safe in. keep doing ur thing. there s plenty of ppl on ur side.
the best evidence against the  patriarchy  I have ever seen.
just.... what  this is ridiculous. but thanks melonie  great video!
so if soy canturn male catfish to female  what does that make soy boys   also  soy  at least the way its used in nestle s golden morn  hurts my stomach  so no soy for me.
please let us not go through who was women of the years choice...I beg of you
investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list  in some months time you ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today.
4 38 - thats not opinion. thats reality  whether others want to admit it or not.Im going to be really honest here. its times like this where I wonder whether this nation  and world as a whole  is too far gone and not worth praying for...
cant wait for the venture capital for this company finally dries up.
didn t the babylon bee get kicked off twitter for doing exactly this
I liked milly alcock better.
inb4 the twitter addicts respond with  how dare you misgender this biologically female non-binary person!!! rrreeeeeeeee!!!1!!
very reasonable take  thank you for sharing
at this point being a woman and man doesnt mean anything to these people...
my life has totally changed because Ive been earning  15 250 returns from my  4 000 investment with james brian.
I heard a lot of investing with mr james brian  and how good he is  please how safe are the profit
after watching so many youtube tutorial videos about trading I was still making losses untill james brian started managing my investment now  Imake  6 800 weekly. God bless mr brian . his been a blessing to my family.
thank s a lot I have contacted him now and he s responded.
Im glad to see mr. james brian mentioned here  my spouse recommended him to me after investing  4000 and he has really helped us financially in times of covid -19 lockdown here in australia
Imake   23 450 weekly trading profit with him  I only trust mr james brian with my investments. am now able to send my kids to great schools in la  all thanks to mr james.
I agree with you and I believe that the secret to financial stability is  having the right investment ideas to enable you earn more money  I dont know who agrees with me but either way I recommend either real estate or crypto and stocks.
Im so happy for taking the bold step in investing a little start up capital with after a week I received my profits to my bank
with mr james brian as your investment account manager  you are sure if making over 70  profit from your investment every week. Im a living testimony.
@lassie griffin s  I want to start my trading with him .. how do I contact him please..
fun fact  leon edwards lost all but 1 round of a championship fight and then proceeds to knock out the male champion after years of campaining for the ufc mens werlterwight title...emma d arcy is on thatsame list
the sad thing is  this is real.
she plays her role well in the got series. she is still a woman! she has a vagina! its not like she s a hermaphrodite! then  and only then  is she able to use either gender--or be gender neutral!
leon edwards is the only real man on that list and wont stand a chance of winning because of it
things like this are the reason for the growing apathy towards the msm.
our society is turning into a real cesspool...
we are progressing backwards as a society right now .I almost wish emma darcy wasn t playing rhaenyra.
gq has had women on their menu of the year list for years. this is old news. jennifer lopez had been on the list  jennifer aniston too
that is very stupid and doesnt make sense at all the world we live in
melonie  my son has a soy allergy.  you would not believe how difficult it is to prepare food for him. and restaurants   its horrible.
I swear... people behind the agenda are  geniuses  of marketing or just didn t see an old episode of the fairy oddparents in which all people became genderless gray blobs the plagiarism! never thought I d be alive to watch such brilliant strategy applied
Imiss the old days when this kind of behavior was diagnosed for what it is. a mind disease.
so  in summary  continue not giving af about gq. gotcha.
honestly  if Imade the same list as her for being a man  then I would be insulted for the nomination.
people are actually talking about gq.  mission accomplished.
great call mel
funny but I loved rhaenyra s younger actress milly. I think she did a fantastic job and was disappointed when emma did not give me the same character more grown up. darcy failed and bored me!
I believe I was born in the wrong era lmfaoo
how do you have that blackpink shut down tank when its not even released on their site until the 11th is it a knock off
I dont know where you came from but subbed!!! smart woman!
he s  on telegram
@jamesbrian221
@lassie griffin s   thanks for his info I ll get to him right away
I have never seen any of his clients complain of lost....I think he is just too perfect
ehh... even then  herms typically have traits from one sec that is more prominent and usually identify by that.
saw a quote from an interview she did  where she bragged about being really good at playing female characters as a nonbinary.
obligatory  comment.
thank you for being real
what s wrong with seed oils  I love sesame seed oil. is it bad for you  please someone tell me. also Ive read green tea raises estrogen I dont drink too much green tea but Ive also read it helps burn fat....I really am confused
well  you know thats what a company with low sales will do to keep screaming I am here!!! gq  who cares any ways.
okay I am not alt right but this thing really got to me. in stranger things 4   you see eleven again with the buzzcut in a lab  with other teens in the same clothes  and buzzcut. which makes you think  was eleven with other kids originally  or were they actually other kids who were older  maybe even young adults  but you couldn t tell because they shaved their head and their clothes remove any gender signifiers . in the first season they had this theme with the military being masculine and eleven finding an identity away from  the military by discovering her femininity. but it wasn t that the government was masculine  they were just trying to take away her gender so she could be perpetually a child so she would be more pliable in their codepdent relationship with the military and  papa . all our classic signifiers for adulthood were tied to gender  a by product of diminishing the importance of gender might also be loosing any cultural signifiers for adulthood  and there hasn t be any gender neutral rites of passage to adulthood. I guess you could say something like college is a rite of passage  but I dont think people view view college graduates more than college kids. idk  I think people need to talk about. gender and sexuality a lot more  especially considering what the higher up in the government were like  fbI founding director j edgar hoover was famously rumored to cross dress   but because.we talk about itso little  its easy to play games with our heads about these things
go boom!
hard times create strong men  strong men create good times  good times create weak men  and weak men create hard times. keep it going melonie. long live the common sense.
if she says she s non binary  isn t then calling her a man insulting  by their own woke rules
gq gonna find out the hard way that woke people dont buy their magazines.
the definition of crazy
I doubt much of their audience is men  as we tend to spend a lot less time money on these kinds of magazines  so they probably are trying to appeal to lefty women who are much more likely to read this sort of thing  even if they re trying to give it a  male  aesthetic a a differentiator.
if thats the case  then I demand to be named woman  and mother of the year.
if we could calculate how much time  effort  and human thought has been preoccupied with gender identity politics. its probably the best societal distraction in recorded history  well done if it was by design.think of all the societal struggles of our time  that are objectively more of a priority  which have been given less attention due to our media government sponsored obsession with these types of topics.
gq was arguably never made for real men in the first place.
did the actor who was expected to bomb in his role as daemon targaryen make it on the list
melonie mac speaks the objective truth in this video. no conspiracy theories here.
hey melonie and  lovely dogs  so men of the year every year ismore weird.
fyI catfish can and do change their sex gender depending on need. quite a few fish can do that too so its not that uncommon. triggering the this change artificially doesnt mean soy has the same effect on any other animal that isn t already capable of doing that
the problem sadly is that we politely adhere to these self assigned pronouns in order to be nice  inclusive or understanding so that we ourselves dont get canceled. until we stand up to this idiocy  they ll continue to take everything from us. and men  yes  keep soy out your diet!
saw a t-shirt once thatsaid  I identify as a threat.  my pronouns are try me.
seed oils are some of the worst things you can put in your body  and they put it in all our food unless you cook your own. I suggest going down the rabbit hole on youtube
@melonie mac go boom  I will
literally the actor who carried the show
@pinochet s free skydives  could it  afaik the only thing that was tested is that it cantrigger a same process in a fish that can do it also on a whim.
@pinochet s free skydives  btw  chemical waste in rivers and lakes has been causing gender switching in catfish  and other species that have this ability  for decades.
you will find that is often the problem with people thatsay  x  food bad.  they heard itsomewhere and never even bothered to think about how stupid the claim was.
we would only be drinking water if we removed all the  bad  food from our diet.  soy is no more harmful than anything else  but you sure bought into that myth.
let louis theroux win. he has given us documentaries since the 90 s. but he wont win
there isn t a word for people who aren t anorexic or body dysmorphic  so there shouldn t be a word for people who aren t gender dysphoric. btw  Im not super worried that the residual soy in our diet will feminize men. the culture that created samuraI  sumo wrestlers and dragon ball z has a heavily soy diet  so I think we ll be alright.
you are a nerd and not watching house of the dragon   its awesome. this men of the year thing is silly... but harmless. she s great in the show  and the show is as good as first four seasons of game of thrones. dont miss it. you should be doing vids about it.  a little late to the party  but blttn
the world we live in
Imean Ive never bought a gq magazine. and I probably never will. ignore  dont comment on it  commenting on it just convinces the children that they re right.
last hawk. you me up into the point about hormones.
if emma identifies as non-binary and uses they them pronouns  wouldn t being pigeon-holed into a particular gender be deemed offensive
without milly alcock   emma wouldnt be noticed!!
melonie s just salty thatshe missed the deadline to be man of the year 2022.and no one outside the access media was  raving  about what darcy was doing in hod. they were talking about matt smith and paddy consadine carrying the show.
thanks for speaking the truth
the first thing a cult does is establish a problem you are unable to fix.  then the cult offers you the solution.impossible statement    gender is fluid and changeable.    cult    we also believe this untrue thing.     et al.
gq is getting exactly what they want. people talking about them.
I think the rottweiler should get votet bird of the year.
do the research on soy again  you may need to change the thought process about vegetable  estrogen
the easiest solution is making a new award about  trans of the year . because isn t it kinda sexist to put a non-binary person in a contest that is binary
and this is why I stick with anime and eastern tv.
milly alcock played a way better rhaenyra and  matt smith is who hod owes for much it  plaudits  to haha.... strange times
its pretty sad when this shit does not even shock me anymore
these kinds of decisions simply contribute to the irrelevancy of the magazine.  if you cant even keep men in an award specifically designated to honor men  then you ve lost the plot.  why not person of the year instead  if that is your intention   what a bewildering choice thatsubverts the entire point of the publication.
valkiry is the new king of asgard  there s a movie named the woman king  so its not really a surprise. you wanna know where it comes from     big corps spend huge amounts of cash to reverse traditional roles with woke propaganda because they think they dont need manly men to build the world and do maintenance anymore  because they re confident that they re close to build perfect robots that will handle all of the dirty work while the only humans working will be behind a desk  typing on a key board or using a phone and that both men and women can do that. and the rest will be at home  waiting for their universal salary paid by the governement  based on their social creditscore.simple as that.
I was bored with the first episode  and I have no desire to see a relationship between cousins so I pass. Im convinced hollywood is trying to normalize incest
how is it harmless when they re trying to teach the younger generation that men and women cant be defined  and are the same
@emma     the simple truth is that a small percent of people dont fit well into the biological or cultural sex or gender types. why should they be made to feel miserable  just for being different  teaching children that they exist and should be accepted just like anyone else is not going to somehow cause children to grow to be trans  or gay  or whatever it is that you are so afraid of. other people s sexuality   gender identity does you no harm. live and let live.as far as claiming there s no difference between men   women generally  there s a tiny  but loud  minority preaching that. but there s a lot fewer of them than there are  for example  trump cultists  so  you dont really have much to worry about.
@scott graham  thinking she s not a male or female  how does putting her on the mens list help alleviate that edit  you dont need to teach people that a certain group exists. no one told me gay people existed I just came to realise that myself by you know  existing. just like how no one taught me straight people exist. what kind of argument is that lol. also using the  youre scared card  doesnt work
@scott graham  please  just answer the question already lmao
@emma     I have answered. your question is invalid. her identification as  non-binary is not a symptom of mental illness. there is nothing to  alleviate . and what do you care what lists the editors at gq make  your favorite magazine can make a list of manly macho men of the year. see  everyone happy.just saw your edit  so   1  yes  you are frightened. deny it all you like  but you now it is true.   2  children need to be taught not to feel bad about who they are  aspects of themselves they had no choice about. given that there is still a lot of hate and preaching that atypical sexualities are  wong    sick    evil    sinful   it behooves society to teach all children that this is simply not true. gay  trans  etc  may be be relatively uncommon  but are perfectly normal variations in human development. nobody should be condemned  treated with disgust  or taught to believe something is wrong with them  as they begin to realize that they feel quite different about themselves and about sex than all the  normal  people around them. and the rest of children need to know these variations are ok  so they do not treat them with disgust and bullying.why is this so hard to for you to understand  have you no love  kindness  or compassion in your heart
@scott graham  you haven t answered actually. I asked how does being categorised as a man help emma
@scott graham  I dont really get how her thinking she isn t a man or woman has anything to do with being gay  either. why do you keep bringing that up  lol. Im not afraid of gay people  friends with a couple actually.
@emma      friends with a couple actually . glad to hear it.  being gay  is one version of uncommon sexuality that  until very recently  would get someone rejected  abused  and quite possibly killed. there are still a great many people in the world who would prefer to return to such times. woohoo  glad you are not one of those. you should be proud. want a medal  I dont  keep bringing it up  other than as part of that broad category. so  you are not afraid of gay people. well answer the question  what are you afraid of  no lies now. not to yourself. not to me.
the agot show sucked after season 4 because they got past the books. it was dumb of them to cut out half the characters and storylines to do short seasons representing books that were over a thousand pages each. considering it took g.r.r martin a decade between releasing books 4 and 5  they shoulda known better. books live action adaptation as usual.
@scott graham  isnt calling emma a man phobic or something  also the reason why Imentioned brain scans is because being transsexual involves having a mental condition. being gay doesnt  as far as Im aware. anyways I did ask the initial question and changed the words because my reference to emma having something mentally wrong with her to think she is no gender upset you and yourefused the answer. my whole question is based upon the fact that calling her what she is  a female is some kind of phobic but it isnt to call her a man  so shouldnt she be crying rn about it or something  lol
they are non-binary... how would your suggested list help  I think you mean  person of the year .
reverse traditional roles   you are aware woman have held power throughout history right  at minimum you must have heard of cleopatra.
this is the male equivalent of a t-girl volley ball team
I agree with you  if youre going to call it  man  of the year then itshould only have people who identify as man. or rename the list to  person  of the year. but you are wrong about gender and biology.you said  they want us to ignore biology and have a genderless society. that is very much like saying  they want us to ignore shoes and have a society without pizza. shoes have nothing to do with pizza and biology has nothing to do with gender.biology determines sex  not gender  and those are very different things. sex comes from what biological chromosomes  hormones   and even genitals you have. gender is a made up concept that describes how people feel about their own identity. the feelings are real but the concept itself is just a social construct.so yeah  if we are talking about gender then we absolutely must ignore biology because biology has nothing to do with gender.read a book that isn t the Bible or watch a video that doesnt come from ben shapiro  - get some actual experts who explain sex and gender  and then you will understand this concept better. or at least  you wont be blinded by misinformation anymore. I recommend a video by an incredible educator named forrest valkaI called sex and sensibility. it takes 30 minutes of your life but at least then you wont be misinformed anymore. is it a waste of 30 minutes no.we live in a society where gender is at the forefront of politics  culture  religion  society  entertainment  sports - almost everything we ever see or hear is tangled up in this discussion.might as well spend 30 minutes to understand it all.if you care at all about reality. otherwise  if you dont care about reality  carry on.
eddie munson man of the year
you know what s funny is if a man did this we all know what will happen like how we treated the lizzo situation but its okay for women to do this and yet cry for our help to make their content great.  like what she hulk did. Imean at this point if man wants to leave america I say why not man been happier after they left. yha the gender names never makes sense if your still being a women in the inside cause we can all play a part on the outside. wow now they going after the food we eat like is this a trap to kill us off or what cause if everyone turns into female thats it we are finished specially if now man who  becomes female dont want to get laid and have kids cause only man and women can do that Im so scared to live any further now.
gigan is still better.
gq  I am flabbergasted.
darcy wasn t even one of the top 3 preformances on hotd. paddy considine  matt smith and olivia cooke were much better in their roles.
delusion is the denial of objective reality  thats why its classified as insanity. all the social adjustments made for inclusive identification of the trans community has not affected suicide rates a smidge. them they deserve to live a life they love as much as anyone else but it wont come with only a nod of the head from society they need real help as well. an analogy is criminals who are punished but not helped as criminality is not a behavior problem its a mental health issue.it wont make sense melonie because your sane.
this video is so reactionary and ill informed lmao. gq men of the year haven t honored solely men in years. this year alone zoe kravitz  leah williamson and sidney sweeny are also being honored. but I guess that doesnt get the attention that a  non-binary  actress gets lol.
good Im tired of winning every year.  it gets tiresome  p
the double standard is strong  here. nature  and therefore God  doesnt do  non-binary   and on that ground alone I am dead set against it. Im not even the most traditionally masculine guy out there and even I know Im a guy at heart  and Ive never once questioned that. bizarro world is what we live in these days.
criminy  are there like 20 cats back there behind you
if soy is so emasculating  how did the asian cultures eat so much of it and not completely fall apart   genuinely curious.  Imean  they fell to complacency  but I dont think anyone s going to argue the didn t have masculine  manly men.
I dont agree women should win man of the year. just like I dont agree men should win woman of the year. having said that emma d arcy blew me away on hotd.
the last bit about soy compounds messing with our biology adds to my reasons as I why I dont want to raise a family. I want my family to accept natural differences and appreciate themselves and others for who they are. I especially would not want to raise a family in the united states if it doesnt spread to any other country. this is disgusting and frightening. maranatha
you are right on. the ones at the top behind all this are not human.
many people confuse cultural gender with biological gender. if a woman enjoys working on cars  cultural gender norm   itshould be ok  but that doesnt make her male  biological gender . if a man likes to sew  cultural gender norm   itshould be ok  but that doesnt make him female  biological gender . Im fine with the notion that people should be free to pursue their cultural interests  but biological gender is not a choice. its a semi-random event that happens at conception  yes  sometimes nature messes up  but those instances are rare . biological gender is genetics  not a choice. you can swim as much as you like  but you cant choose to be a catfish. no amount of wishing will make it true. the same is true for biological gender. again  I support people who want to pursue interests that are traditionally ascribed to the other gender  but that does not  cannot  and will not make them the other gender. nothing will  including hormones and surgery.
that keto diet is working miracles  because you look almost a decade younger than your actual age.
go way back to music awards when they gave best guitar player to a violinist
a women of the year is a man and man of the year is a women.  thinking that that makes no sense makes you a bigot.  leon edwards should win man of the year  btw.
@0x736174616e20  youre right. I was trying to keep itsimple.

how many average joes in asia are walking around with good muscle tone and amazing shape in general  america is obese  asia is skinny-fat. the asian fitness influencers I have watched cut back on rice and soy to reach their goals.
@melonie mac go boom  Imore meant historic asia.  is soy perhaps processed differently now   but still  thats interesting to know  thank you.
enjoy writing yourself out of history then.
everybody wants to rule the worldby tears for fears welcome to your lifethere s no turning backeven while we sleepwe will find youacting on your best behaviour turn your back on mother nature everybody wants to rule the world......
wow  gq  youre so progressive and now the whole world knows it. pat yourself on the back.
this is ridiculous  but I dont think the show is bad. its actually quite good if you ask me.
so can I get on the list for women of the year   p
if andrew tate s not at the top then the list is total bs
men of the year is keanu reeves
why though  let s promote irrational garbage. no thank you. thats all I see online these days. I am thankful to live in the mostly conservative state of new hampshire. many of our citizens open carry  I am sure you know what I am talking about. I used to work in a circle k  I had customers coming in strapped all the time. it use to be a great talking point. I d ask them about the model  and ammo caliber. there are few adults in my area that believe in woke ideology. I do have a good friend who does  and she s a sweet heart  though sometimes we get into deep discussions over it because I dont follow the woke sjw crowd.
well we now let girls into the boys scouts . melonie   I love how God has made us male and female   men and women  now no person should be abused or mistreated male or female   I always feel like it was such a magical and amazing   but I guess us human beings just cant happy with how our creator has made us   I am so thankful and happy with the way our creator had designed it all .
having a  men of the year  list seems stupid to begin with  but this...
gq still exists  apparently not for much longer.
yeah... there s a lot of sludge in food.  the struggles of grocery shopping when youread the ingredient label and realize everything is trash.  I dont get the whole getting rid of gender propaganda.  its like watching a vengeance series  except its a hot mess with so many messed-up scenarios.  technically  I cant call myself lesbian anymore for some reason because its offensive. lol. everything is bs.
that man needs a good clock
she hasn t experienced hormonal testicle-aches    genuinely a real thing  Ive had it on and off  itsucks
its called man of the year
logbook entry for november 2022  we still continue to live in clown world.
thank you for speaking out about this! none of this makes any logical sense
well I guess she was more manly .. than most modern men
born without a johnson  youre not a  john .... son.
and these people wonder why publications aren t successful and are slowly dying off. I d like to see some actual honest numbers on their company stats. willing to bet that they ve been dipping more gradually into irrelevancy and thats one of the reasons why they pull crap like this.
to be fair  didn t we have a male  woman of the year  last year or something
so she was the eldest male heir all along. case closed.
we are truly living in the end times the world s going to shit.
honestly does anyone take these awards seriously
I wana see those men of the year change a tyre
just make it people of the year list or humans of the year list. I have no more f  ks to give anymore.
thought she was great in house of dragon a very good actress. thats my truth if you dont like it I dont care loved her
I love that the catfish has soyface. lol. somebody meme that picture  please.
playing fast and loose with the term   man
oh boy!!! cant wait for the  women  of the year list.  mwuahahaha
we are borderline south park reality
my cynical nature suggest that all these lists are based on how much advertisements dollars they receive. so  house of the dragon may have given money in advertisement thus giving the spot on a list. a.k.a. political rather than based on other factors.
I want off this roller coaster  I ll come back when sense comes back to this schizophrenic teenage planet
end goal  no sense of identity. I have spoken.
lol idk why they linked your halloween costume like you dont look better than all of the women on that list
wtf  how does that work exactly
meanwhile  so they turned the catfish female in order to.... catfish catfish
this is like saying caitlyn jenner just wonthe sexiest man alive.. oh wait....
whaaaat... tbh Im not even shocked anymore.
Christian  lifter  antI soy seed oils. based
tbh I dont know why I end up watching
she s going to be real pissed when she finds out there s no such thing as male privilege
I thought gq was a woman s magazine this entire time.
here s an idea  maybe they should just call it person of the year  jeezus
emma d arcy is a wonderfull actress  I loved her in hotd. now  if she  or  they   considers  themself  a  nonbinary  person  I still dont know what the hell that is precisely  but anyway   then neither best actor nor best actress should be good enough for  them  and the logical thing is to reject those awards... but if she was coherent  she wouldn t be saying she is  nonbinary . and that was just about best actor actress. if we talk of man of the year... yeah  that is literally insane  everyone  including her  can see she is a woman  period. it is not a debatable thing.
and this is why no one will miss modern media when they inevitably go bankrupt.
keep being you
man of the year trent reznor
ahem you seem to be having a nice hair day over there.  3
she identifies as non binary then I identify as attack helicopter I go brhhhhhh
this is payback for caitlin jenner winning woman of the year.
sounds about right for hollywood.
in jail I was told they trying mind control   so they testing it what ever it is on people
thanks for sharing
your 0 00 is awsome xd!  apart from that keep it up!
dafuq!
Im assuming most real women would be insulted by being added to such a list. if I was given woman of the year  I d raze hell.
just waiting for them to declare johnny cash a trans-activist for his song  a boy named sue
mental health is real. thanks goodness Im a normie.
thats it! Im outraged! I just wont hear that we re not all just amorphous blobs!  cant you just  trust the science    monster!
I kept sword fish as a kid  if there was no males in the tank one of the females would turn male and vice versa
you can bet  it      will win the award... just call it  person of the year -list  make it all inclusive and be done with it...
actual men dont give a shit about those lists  nor do we read any magazine or publication that produces them.  we re too busy building  maintaining  and fixing all the shit thatsociety needs to thrive.
I still like the show
gq has been extremely non  gentlemenly  for quite some time now.
the world is insane.
eh I dont mind it if emma dont mind
sounds like they re trying to get back at men for when they laughed their asses off about the kardashian father guy who  turned  into a woman and wonthe woman of the year award
Im going to need the earth to stop spinning for a little  I want to jump off.
emma d arcy should censure gq. she should insist on a special category of man-and-woman of the year.
people are gona freak out and call this too woke without realizing that this award is not designated for just men. they should probably rename it
soooo is she gonna be up for an emmy in the men s category
sounds like a gq problem to me.
hbo and hollywood have lost their dam minds.
lol how come ellen page isnt man of the year!  I hear she cut her hair short and likes to wear hats now. you know  real manly things
welcome  one and all!! welcome to clown world!! cue circus music
gq s man of the year list... half of it with female names! yeap  clownworld 1 0 1
make it make sense gq
man.. this whole I identify as something Im not... should all be treated as identity fraud.
this is how men turning away these days from woman careless and going for mature woman.
more madness.
how exactly has it even made this list  what has it done to even justify being on any list like this   years and years ago these lists were full of people who have made some kind of difference in the world and have hearts of gold. now theyre just full of celebrities who literally do absolutely nothing but bitch about how much the world sucks from their twitter account.
either someone messed up or gq has become a clown show. but  doing a search it is true jennifer lopez was on the cover. doesnt make sense.
the world is a silly place.and so is emma d arcey evidently.
there is no such thing as  non-binary  or  cis
I have to say  that pic of you at 0 45 looks very nice.
I was going to comment on how illogical this was  but this is 2022... so  if anything  Im surprised that this surprised me.
its the spaghetti-o s
what is gq s definition of  men
gq   geocentric quarterly.
none of this sht existed before social media
they want us to become baphomets.
people cant force other s to agree with them or make other s care about the same things that they do. individuals
fellow carnivore here  lets gooooo!
if Im being pushed to think anyone can be any gender at any time of the day.....no
Im just gonna have to be real with you her list is not accurate  because I am the man of the year
the goobacks are coming
gq knows nothing about gentleman
ya know what is weird... I find emma d arcy  in the rhanerya wig  attractive. however  irl she has a weed whacker haircut that just does nothing for me. in fact  she looks like a different person entirely.thatsaid  its gq... they ve been safe to ignore for a while now.
yayyy! thank you so much!
love your content  fix your audio. if you need help dm me.
this foolishness is beyond me
3 10 I hate so much that they added  cis  to describe actual  default women.
yeah  twitter is a cesspool of people who try to dunk on others while being absolutely wrong.its like dunking on a little tikes basketball hoop and getting all pumped about it.
I cant remember the last time  gentleman s quarterly  was even remotely a magazine for men by men. the magazine has been trash for many years.
I dont get the 0 49 attempt at an insult they re trying to make. are they trying to say the goth badass outfit is manly  I knew girls in high school and university who dressed like that regularly and they were hyper feminine  they just liked black accessories and makeup.
I love the blackpink shirt!
how was the movie with your dad
damn  try not to awaken the masses too fast  might cause a macro-fissure in the time space continuum. lol
welcome to clown world.
w t actual f  to paraphrase jack nicholson in batman    this world needs a enema    .we are living in hell .
honestly I preferred rhaenyra original cast milly alcock who played the younger version for like half the season. she is barley getting any credit for introducing rhaenyra. I get that the fame must have been hard on her but stil.
reason rewards like these means fuck all
welp  they did have a man get woman of the year award  so now its to tip the balance even if its phobic to do. but rules for thee and not for me  mindset.
I hate the world we live in now
ooooooohhh was that a doggy in the background
I kinda to ask boiling a frog  were that come from
well. they did already made the trans women ladies of the year. remember catelyn jenner  this is only adding more flames to insanity world itself
Im non binary too!!! that means Im a victim and you owe me ney!!!
this world is going to burn!
amazing!
Im just commenting on thumbnail  this why I never want anything to do with hollywood ever. not even if they change  they dont get to act however stupid and get away with it. its an insult.
thats gq for you.we already know what kind of  men  read that rag...
how much longer is this ridiculousness going to go on  put a hetero guy for woman of the year and the sky is falling. I guess Im just sick of the hypocrisy and double standards. and I have to wonder what people behind the scenes really think  do they honestly think they re pulling the wool over our eyes or do they just not care
Im sorry melonie  but I cant co-sign this vid.
so biological women are winning man of the year and biological men are winning woman of the year. did they just mix up the envelopes
such a good show and clueless people on the cast.....
I keep getting an image of that fugly lara croft figure you featured.. the one that had a more pronounced square jaw than batman from dark knight returns batman. ooof. cults do things like this..to get you to seperate your individual self and more as a number. like binary  makes it easier to believe whatever they re using you for.
shit  I didn t hear this thing henry  queervil sat his name
there is 3 more women on the list
stuff like this proves we need Jesus
okay  done with gq
I think she looks hot in house of the dragons but then I looked her up on google.... wish she stuck with the hotd look.
hollywoke is laced with sausage cutters
I prefered the first rhaenyra
its okay as long as a man can be woman of the year.
I really liked her in house of the dragon  but she needs to sort her insanity out.

honestly they really should just change the name of the award
I really dont know what s going on anymore
I want out of this world assap
make it make sense
itseems like they re taking the idea of treating men and woman equally to ridiculous extremes.
this is even more inexplicable than trans  women  winning  woman of the year  awards. she doesnt even pretend to be a man.
you say it rin-ear-uh
they re putting chemicals in the water and they re turning the freaking fish gay
wow
people have had enough of this nonsense. she has breasts  and not from too much testosterone either. Im not going to learn a new language  keep itsimple like that
why not just call it person if the year
and my favorite fruit is nuttela
elliot page was robbed.
but its been like so with beer for the longest its nothing new but to the fact they changed the sex on a cat fish with soy milk makes me wonder al those time Ive drank soy milk
I am sure its just a bug.
oh for Gods sake
Ive been trying my best my whole life and he gets it his first year
what s the point of calling it a men list if youre gonna have everybody on it
tom cruise didn t make that list
I think they have nominated women in the past. I think they should just change the name of the list i.e.  people of the year  or something like that. otherwise it will keep creating this mess.
it revenge for all those men winning women s sports events.
and they shall call good evil and call evil good   the destruction of morality and reverence to God is not by accident.
hahahahaha
he was right
and they just showed exactly why lists like this are a joke  have been a joke for a long time now and no one really cares and haven t really cared for a long time now. like the oscars and other awards its nothing bug a bunch of people with massive egos fluffing up each other s egos.its funny how interest in award shows decreased as people had increased access to the internet and free porn. its almost as if people only tuned in to see the women in sexy dresses.
since when has gq been relevant
you will complain about anything huh
these clowns are out of control
wasn t there that whole  person of the year  list  maybe even  individual of the year . you know what  I want to be on the  richest of the year  list. what s my annual income  irrelevant  get me on that list or youre not inclusive enough. the hell is going on with people
melonie stay being a girl. be proud of it. this lunacy is about to get a strong slap in the face.
dude I thought I was seeing things. rip
all I can say to these people is get in the last of your clown world crap while you can  because those days are coming to an end real quick like.
I also hated house of za dragon  couldn t finished za first episode
first of all  regardless of what our opinions  and I say opinions because all of this is very clearly in the realm of opinion  not fact as some seem to think  but regardless of our opinions on whether she should be considered a man or not  she was not even a break out star period. her acting as rhaenarya was very vanilla and only occasionally had decent moments. so my point is  even if you agree she be considered a man  she still doesnt deserve to be on this list.
dont buy or read gq got it!!!
what.....the.....fork
did you know thatsea turtles gender is depends on the weather
idk for animals  as certain frogs can change sex in certain circumstances like a lack of the other sex  but God made us different from animal I believe. he made us in his image   male and female he created them  in the first book of the Bible.
.... what did you just say
hotd owes her  yes  her  nothing. she s passable in the role  but nothing special. give me a break.
it just means gq is a joke
gq was never a magazine for masculine men.
yaaass.. qu...ki.... uuhm....
but if the situation was reversed. nuclear war
but you can see thatshe has short hair in that photo.  didnt you know  modern day logic says that if you have short hair and can get away with a passing resemblance to a man  it means you are automatically a man.
odd.  very odd.
I am so confused
who reads gq
this is beyond ridiculous...
Im not that mad. itseems like women are getting back at the men stepping on their toes in their sports and entertainment roles.fair play I say.
they wanna drop the genders for the awards thats fine  but just call in person of the year. you got men winning women of the year  and women winning man of the year.Im waiting for an adult to win world s cutest baby.also once gender is officially  eliminated  is the term human being next cause it ain t much left to water down.
the loonies are well and truly in charge of the asylum right now.
okay this one is just ridiculous
these people are demented. cant wait till elon cleans up the twitter dumpster. already off to a great start.
are they guilt of misgendering in this situation
did gq just assume emma d arceys gender by awarding a man of the year   surely this is some type of dumb istic or phobic crap like that
I confused wht the he ll is that thing is itsomething of beo wolf . some one help please
give me a fucking break xd
oh ffs!
I thought the point of being non-binary is not to be identified as the original genders  male and female   how is emma  men of the year
I was watching this show after this thats itshe s a woman
lolz its so ridiculous. funny enough when a dude gets woman of the year. now we can have it both ways! is truly comical.
bruce jenner thats right I said bruce won woman of the year award so why does this come as a surprise
not really  men are getting women of the year awards every year and even ulta has two men dressed up like women to tell everyone what girlhood is like for some dumb campaign. men and women both are being affected by this bogus movement
isn t  man of the year     human of the year  instead of  male of the year   I really dont know and truly dont care  just curiosity  besides those  awards  are allways full of shit .
henry cavill  man of the year !
aoc was on a gq cover... let thatsink in.
they got female awards  so I dont get it I know why they doing it but still dont get the stupidity  of it.
ohhh the insanity continues  I sort of find myself wishing for first hand proof of extraterrestrial abduction  knowing my luck as the ship soars out of the solar system and I down a pan-galactic gargleblaster or 6  the engineer will fix the universal translator .....klatu verata niktu.beep .... so human what s your pronouns   aaaaarrrrrgggggghhhhhhhh
well  considering richard levine is a contender for woman of the year  it only seems fair that a woman be on the man of the year list.
ya we all have to be part of these peoples delusions! no thanks
good thing nobody actually cares about these kinds of lists.  they re about as relevant as me posting my own list in a yt comments section.
men can be women of the yearwomen can be men of the yearwhat s the point anymore
I expect to see men on the woman of the year list  since we re not being sexist here.
wtf
soy is terrorizing... even vinegar based salad dressings are full of it.
totally insane as she is biologically female and portrays herself only as  female  in her roles. she does not claim to be male but claims to be  non-binary  meaning even if she s made comments about  portraying  females  she is not claiming to be male either meaning she does not belong on this list.if this were a  person of the year  award then it can be said to make sense. gq is also including  cis  identification for normal people. remember   trans  means  transitioning  meaning they are changing and not one or the other much as a caterpillar transitions to a moth... its a transition from one form to another.now  as melonie points out  there have been other women mentioned for gq s man of the year and that the past women like jennifer lopez never identified as anything but female.this means that gq is the problem and the people they re hiring are completely lost as you can still have a gq where you list a woman of the year award without it affecting your men of the year award  and  what about misgendering as melonie addresses and how gq lists emma as  honorary male  which is even more ridiculous.if this is what you get as a subscriber to gq  I would say end your subscription as they re getting nothing right as they misgendered emma and they re putting women in the man of the year award who do not identify as anything more than female  they do not serve men  women  non-binary  trans... they re completely lost and trying to exploit gender views they obviously do not understand but desire to exploit.melonie is Christian and often expresses this as if she always has to defend herself. but she often interjects her Christian faith needlessly into her conversations which is why she feels the need to do that. I cant say I agree with her Christian views even if I consider myself Christian so I dont get the need for her to do this. so why not block her as she says and why keep sharing her videos  she has common sense and she s obviously not your typical Christian but maybe a more modern variation.I generally enjoy her presentation but when she interjects her Christian views  they seem so out of place and almost forced into the topic of conversation. one can do this in a much smoother way where there s no need to apologize or almost threaten people that Im Christian and Im gonna say what I want so nyaaaa. while I in no way am a  practicing Christian   I do talk about faith and belief at times where it fits rather than something like calling she-hulk a giant green slut and then interjecting we all know what the Bible says about giants.lol  but its her show and she can do it as she sees fit even if it often seems to come out of nowhere and knocks you off the track you were following.
a women as man of the year  in a men s magazine  Im done with gq  I see the feminization already with that magazine....
du du du you think she s male gq
they named hillary clinton one of the toughest men of all time about 20 years ago  that is when I realized it wasn t really a men s magazine anymore and cancelled my subscription.
this is 100  reason I gave up on politics  and hollywood. we need a grate person to put thing back in order to be in charge. in all actuality.  thats mostly why I have ended up soo better  because they want us to be gender less. and I just want to get married to a women and give her kids.
I guess it is only fair  bruce jenner was woman of the year one year I think. it is only fair that your side take one from us! well played  emma  well played.
wait  she s female  I thought she was a tran
tell them to commit last online 9 months ago. they just banned my previous comment here on youtube just for saying
100s of small initiatives to curb population growth.
wtf dude
lol what is going on
what !
shouldn t non binary have their own separate list what with them not wanting to be male or female  Imean if I was non binary ied kinda be insulted to be put on a list of men or women.
to your point of miss gendering her by putting her on this list. the people that demand you call them whatever gender or pronoun they want you to use are the first people to call you a cis woman weather you like it or not.
I dont know why but it totally irks me that emma darcy is a woman  acts in female roles  is stunningly gorgeous done up in wardrobe for rhaenyra  and then everyone pretends non-binary is a real thing  pretend she s a  man  and she intentionally shaved her head like jeremy from the pearl jam video.  Imean  such wasted potential.  Imiss when boyish girls were just tomboys.
I know I am better for I am the greyest and the blobiest.
an actress winning man of the year for playing a female character  hmmm.
they re also the worse of the two actresses actors that play that character. so there s that as well.
wouldn t she simply be a tomboy  I dont get it...their need for titles is fully out of hand.
what an insult to men
what is a men
Im not sure if you are trolling
lol. as a man I can give 2 fs   . kinda stupid and arrogant thatsome rando magazine will tell men what a man is.
...if its going to be this way  then lets not complain about trans athletes in women s sports
wonder where they sit on the alleged gender pay gap
wait a minute  do you honestly mean to tell me people think gq is relevant
what is wrong with these people
ha ha
by some extraordinarily confused people.
its damn confusing...cause she they are identifying as non binary get nominated for best male...Im done this world is dumb
saw someone say youre just finding a way to be transphobic which kinda confused me. how does one do a transphobia towards a non-binary
imagine a non-binary man competing for woman of the year.... the screeches we would hear...
the west is getting weird.
dont care love rhaenyra
they need to stop the none sense and they stop giving it to men and woman make it one prize for who us the better actor cuz it is not about equlity or any thing there to many mad poeple with crazy idaI  out there and we get sick of this
wtf ..
but if you need protection us good man will do it any women like you who are waking up to this mess must be protected cause there are  who has been canceled cause of doing things like what you are doing now
look more like gq is just desperate for attention since nobody buys or subscribes to gq anymore lol.
this whole non-binary thing is honestly  dare I say  dumb.
melonie  looking smoking hot as the smoking hottest goth chick in all of comics.weirdo on twitter   worry about yourself.  dude  get yo  damn eyes checked xd  why do woke types gotta  be so 1998 conservative when it comes to goth !anyway  I guess if a man who identifies as a woman can be woman of the year  why cant a woman who doesnt even identify as a man be a man of the year  equality! but given that there are multiple women on that list  maybe they mean  men  in the generic sense... so is it okay to use male terms like  mankind  and  yous guys  again
what is a man
how progressive.
honestly who cares who the man of the year is
why not have a woman as man of the year they already made a man woman of the year   bruce jenner
I wish I didn t know these things
nobody. mel is just pointing out the insanity of msm and pronoun weirdo asylum twitter.
isn t she he it them carrots non binary  why is she he it them carrots put in a supposedly binary award list
why not have the top 10 non binaries of the year. isn t it insulting to lump them with the evil male patriarchy   p
will men allow this like women have for a while  find out next on western whiling
100 years ago some bright spark thought that language was what divided people  caused conflict  misunderstanding and disharmony. so they created a new language  mostly latinate  but with different nouns bolted on  but it was basically synthetic. it was called esperanto. it never caught on  because there were no native speakers. no parents spoke it at home to their kids. the current stage of gender erasure is similar to that deep confusion about causality  language comes from thought. thought precedes language. to erase language with synthetic grammar and syntax  with a new thing  is putting the cart before the horse  the river doesnt run back up hill  you cant change minds with new words. 2020s gender ideology  biological erasure and word naming obsessions is the esperanto of biological sex differentiation. thats why itsounds so weird and internally conflicted. its not going to work either.
ashley walters is a man. he plays in show called top boy.
huh   what the hell I thought she was female
its not a conspiracy theory regarding the agenda behind the gender dysphoria topic. watch the  what is a woman  documentary for starters and go from there
last time I checked she s not a man so..
never though I love to see the day the united states of america cant tell the difference between a man and a woman.
dont listen to gq at all.   got it.
wtf
doesnt the term princess mean female  end of discussion
why dont they just have a person of the year  calling it  man of the year  is meaningless if you put women on it.
very weird.
u call it insane  I call it insulting  just think all men s hard work . where is she hulk nomination by the way  take it easy .
nothing makes sense anymore.  nothing.
idiocy
so trans-idologs could win at both separate categories of women and men all while claiming to be of both and neither at the same time.3 54 wanna tell me how seeing people doing actual truly messed up things out in the fucking open to crowds of people and telling use their goals and intentions is even consider a  conspiracy . when someone runs by and and steals your purse before of the teller and everyone in the damn story is not a figment of your imagination that acutely happen. just as a company putting a woman in man of the year just happen with them posting all the stupid inhuman un-rasionality bs to say why they need to dismantle gender this and that etc. for the six millionth time this year of the last five. quit it with t with the bastards saying to not believe your lying eyes to be a conspiracy!
casual fans falling for the same trap as the original game of thrones series. I follow the hound s philosophy  fuck the king   fuck the queen   this would have be labeled as hate speech on facebook.
biology has nothing to do with gender gender has nothing to do with anything.
I commented four minutes in...oops  you covered it. ha.
Imean thats kinda what happens. the greens and blacks both get fucked up. Lord cragen stark comes down with a big ass army  executes a bunch of people who are still left. sets one person up as king ends the conflict. takes a wife  and then goes home.
this literally takes away from stand outs of men who earned it. if youre biologically a woman and you play female characters you are a damn woman and should not be included in a men of the year list.
going from milly alcock to emma darcy was a huge downgrade  and it has nothing to do with gender identity or political bs...
she is a man
I reject emma d arcey as a  man of the year . try again.
well you had me until you brought up God.
if a female plays a male role and promotes healthy male culture  then they would be eligable for  honorary man of the year . being a chick on tv pretending to not be a chick irl  doesnt make you a man.
shouldnt this actress be offended a magazine thinks she is a man
you speak the common sense truth about someone  and their response is to ask you to delete yourself and think posting you looking like the actual comic book rendition of neil gaiman s sandman character death  what  emmy d arcy is  quite obviously  a female... what s being lost in translation here  other than purposeful obfuscation of the obvious  I dont get it.
at least  make the list gender neutralmen   women means nothin
they them is still not he him  house of dragon is even worse.
they should just give people like her a non binary award or something  she is not a man in any way
is this just a tactic trying to get women to win all the rewards by having them win the men rewards  and women rewards
hi. trans girl here. I just want to point out   we all arent the same. I agree. a lot of the ideology brought out from my community  more specifically the trans community is just down right like.. stupid. im sorry. dont @ me but it is. I feel like the  me s  of the community are now the minority and it is just sad and I am downright embarrassed to be a part of this community tbh. its like truth is truth. facts are facts. why are we fighting  everyone every which way on things that dont matter  if you arent a biological man or woman  so what  does that mean you cant talk  walk or dress the way you want  no  hell  even if you prefer different pronouns  that isnt such a huge deal either but when you start forcing people to conform to the way you perceive yourself  and abide by the stupid rules and beliefs you are putting out into the air  then you are being a...  insult here  im sorry but I am frustrated and I am not trying to piss anyone off but its like  why are we constantly trying to confuse the masses with lies and aggression  all I can do is just sit and shake my head when one of us goes  missing  because they decided to portray these delusions to the wrong people. its just sad man and I hate it.
big nope
to be fair  she looks more manly than half the people on gq s list  jennifer lopez was on it once for instance lol clown world.
this insane woke bs has to stop.
wellllll  she s more of a man then harry stiles.gq now means generally queer
people still read gq  thats a shame.
Imean dudes being women of the year so not surprised.
meanwhile my used to be favorite youtuber ethan s on twitter fighting to the death to defend this nonsense. sad days
of course  youre going to have backlash because we re dealing with a bunch of nonsensical ignoramuses.
why didn t they just rename it to person of the year  so dumb...
forgive me but this horse shit but it doesnt surprise me. keep up the good work mel and for those hating on you  screw them!
gq is trying to stay relevant.  there not and wont be.
fun fact - the claim of being binary or non-binary works on a binary scale. people identifying as non-binaries still think in binaries. hahahahahahahahahahahaha
if youre a man  reading a magazin like gq  dude....  stahp.... be a man
what the f  k!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
honk honk
non-binary has a chance to win both male and female award  I guess.
hollywood is a joke anyway  just live by your own definitions
gq is an absolute joke.
....
men are men and women are women. if anyone even questions inherent instincts  they need to go see a therspist.
emma d arcey is a female
this is just insulting to men  basically saying one of the best men  is a woman.
this is so disgusting
why not person of the year... and where are submarines  dragons  battleships and attack helicopters of the year... they are so non-inclusive.we live in society... even if we dont want to.
this is the problem with the  trans  movement  it make lying a moral necessity. this destroys all morality.
ugh. hate the Im a giant kid bedroom aesthetic.
gq has always been a compromised rag. nothing to see here  nothing to give credence and pay any mind. its honestly cringe
who cares  no one in this comment section reads gq. when a publication that youread panders to you  do you poop your diapers  lmao at the thumbnails of this grift queens channel. either the biggest pick me or grifting.  probably a little bit of both.
gq has been trash for years. this is not surprising.
bI na ry  b n r   b  n r   learn to pronouncesee definitions in allmathematicsastronomyadjective 1.relating to  composed of  or involving two things. testing the so-called binary  or dual-chemical  weapons 2. relating to  using  or expressed in a system of numerical notation that has 2 rather than 10 as a base.noun.......I ll wait has nothing to do with humans or biological traits some people have been missing this word for a long time now lol
lol soy turning male into female   kinda explains kevin smith.
she s a man
Im just waiting for the day they unintentionally put a trans woman on the list and get a massive backlash for it.
bold move dressing as a non binary deer kin for halloween. nice
she enjoys playing women roles  but yet she isn t a woman  but born a woman  but identifies non-binary... she is so confusing...
clearly  they dont have a biologist on staff......  oh  also  they can get screwed.
you should really stop talking about them if you dont like them.
emma d arcey took over in the middle of the season  time jump  and has brought nothing to the role.
Im so done with these pagan tv shows  witcher  dragon  rick   morty.
is she a man     who s man or woman anymore   what happened to humanity
twitter soyboys
ffs. freaks
wouldn t a non binary person have a non binary name
first of all  spell their name right - d arcy. second of all  saying cis is the  default  and  normal  is very disrespectful  as you indicate that non-binary and non-cis people are just not normal. which they literally are. they just figured out their gender identity. third of all  you never even watched the show  so sharing your opinion on an actor you have no clue about is pretty ignorant. in conclusion  its giving pick-me energy and the need to fit in to male society. check yourself before you wreck yourself.
Im a bit disappointed in house of the dragons. its called gender confusion agenda.. matt smith us carrying the show
yeah um she s a female. so no  she isn t man of the year
hI fwend
what  she uses her birth name.
makes no sense  woke era needs to end.
I agree this is nonsense however  you ll  watch crappy she-hulk but not an incredible show like house of dragons  check it out its worth the time I feel like you ll really enjoy it
this shit needs to stop....
what in the actual crap
let me know when youreach a point of eradicate of humans who will never fit your narrative.
if you want to know how we got here the whole book of judges in the Bible.  also read genesis 1 and 2. God made adam and eve  not adam and steve  nor amanda and eve.
no wonder the hbo writers made daemon bi. he s married to a man  baby.
star  really  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha
personally  I dont see why everyone says hotd is great.  its boring  scenes are straight up lifted out of got but done more poorly  the acting is ok at best  the characters are dumb as fuck compared to got  and there is not enough action for a fantasy show.  if I wanted  family in power has family issues  without the action and intrigue  I d watch a daytime soap opera.
when that actress s character was introduced  I lost all interest in the series.  she plays a character with a gay husband who she holds in constant contempt.  there s nothing to admire  no protagonist.
carnivore is great! eat meat and fats - its the human diet.
she was horrible in this. she looked constipated   stuffy the whole time. hod kinda sucks people just have rop to laugh at harder. got hod by a mile.
who cares
emma is to me the worst actor on house of dragon . she sounds terrible doing her lines .
I dont care .
emma is literally the worst actress on the show. she is aboslutely the weakest casting.
I did check it out and I didn t like it
heck  read the whole Bible cover to cover
@razoro2productions  that goes without saying. Im just saying we got this far because we compromised here a little  bit by bit. we were like frogs in a boiling pot.    to which I say   ribbit!
