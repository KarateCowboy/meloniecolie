we all need to send in the donations so we can see mel do an unboxing of her new lara doll
its fantastic hearing mel try and whisper  smex  cause her parents are staying with her. it carries mad  guys  we have to be quiet cause my mom has work in the morning  vibes and Im here for it.
the original lara was a roll model to younger women. my sister loved lara. she played all the games over and over. so much thatshe grew up to be an archeologist. she went to college for a masters in archaeology.  she became a real world lara thanks to the original lara. dont think it would have been the case with the modern version of lara. as my sis has complained about the new one being a pushover and scared and not looking like the original. really look up to my sister. she turned into an amazing woman thanks to lara.
mel sounds like a kid discovering adult content for the first time lol
you gotta give credit where its due. thats a very realistic looking doll
such care taken in creating the doll. once again  somehow those involved with r34 care more for lara than the official rights holders.
you know you want one  mel. its the ultimate lara action figure and its got a fadge !
it actually looks very high-quality and almost exactly like reboot lara.  I d argue that the people who make that doll care more about the franchise than modern-day eidos does.  thatsaid  I d still prefer having all the core design games added to the switch  xbox  and playstation stores.  there is no reason for them to not have done that yet.
this is probably one of the most hilarious uncomfortable videos Ive watched on youtube.
your  accidental  scrolling reactions were priceless
I love that its not a ranting video and you seem like a fun person melonie!
if the audience buys you that doll youreally need to put her in the background of your videos  dtime to get melonie her new toy!
from a collector s point of view  this is actually really good quality for the price. Ive seen some other life sized stuff like boba fett and darth vader that were even more expensive and not even posable.
I didn t even know this sort of stuff was a thing  Im blown away by how detailed and well-made it looks. I would unironically want this standing in my living room in a cool action pose. I wouldn t be caught dead revealing what it actually is and not a cool life-size model. needs better clothes and gear to put on the model.
wow!  under  3k   thats not bad.  granted  the logistics of cleaning the doll and also  the soul-crushing shame I dont like judging other dudes.  Imean  Im 40 and still dont have kids  a family  so forth.  but even at my loneliest  when I was in and out of the hospital with medical problems a few years ago  I dont think I could  make use  of a life-sized lara croft doll maybe a samus aran doll. no.  even then.
literally took me a solid minute of thinking  as I said to myself   wtf is a shm3xh doll
you just know melonie is getting one  not for sinning  but for winning.
I honestly really liked the initial reboot design. she looked athletic. she was beautiful. she looked exactly like her voice actress  who also did the motion capture  and the more realistic look matched the tone for the new game. classic lara would have looked out of place in the reboot  and reboot lara would have looked out of place in the classic games. classic lara had more of a comic book feel  which as a huge comic fan I loved. I went a little off topic  but the point is  I loved both looks  and felt that those looks matched the games they were set in.... then the sequels happened. rise of the tomb raider wasn t too bad. there were changes made to her model  and those changes did stand out  but she was close enough to how she was in the previous game that I could brush it off. shadow lara on the other hand  sat on the couch and ate doughnuts for 5 years while ignoring her workouts and adventuring. she became what nathan drakes friends joked about him becoming. it was... jarring to say the least.
ohhh she s on sale!   no idea why that made me laugh so much.
the fact that a successful lara croft pron industry exists shows loud and clear that a strong fanbase exists for the original lara croft.the fans want a baddass sexy lara croft.
on onlyfans
ill take melonie and lara both
you would be done in 30 secs with the doll as mel is in the corner of the room smoking and laughing lol
many people underestinate the weight of these dolls and how.... taxing it can be planking that board.30  kilograms  just sounds easy.
@blox117  melonara
@garett frigon  why do you care how long it takes another man to finish
I want to see a lot more than that
they re trying to quit us wanting the angelina jolie version of lara croft. lol
my parents are asleep
@trazyn the infinite  I can relate 30 kg is heavy  and for me it wad juste a torso
@baziwan  jolie s are heavier. lol
Ive played the tr reboot and the start of rottr  but its such a weird combination of her being less capable but also being more superhuman than ever. mostly  I just hate how its like a naughty dog interactive movie instead of being the game that it was and should be. crystal dynamics must have fired lost all of their creative people.
welcome to the concept of the  origin story . was batman a brave  smart man when he was younger
@backup368    so  is your argument that a good character should be a bad one for at least 3 full games  since you asked  yes  bruce was smart and brave as a child  especially when he was in his twenties. he was literally exploring a dark cold cave before the bats scared him. we re not talking about a 7-year-old lara.
its lara not laura.
dont disrespect laura cruz like that thank you.
@jay sullivan   so  is your argument that a good character should be a bad one doesnt elaborate
the original was also hot.
@backup368  weird that her behavior remained the same in subsequent games.
@planguy    I thought it was weird enough that it didn t really change in the first game.
@backup368    you excused it by saying its an origin story. I think its clear that most people dont like the new lara. people loved the old lara. the new one has nearly no charisma or personality  and she shows  as far as Ive seen  no progression toward becoming like lara.
@jay sullivan  what s the best-selling tomb raider game what s the second best-selling tomb raider game what s the third best-selling tomb raider game they all star the lara that  nobody likes  apparently.you can only get so much mileage out of a robotic mary sue that doesnt interact with anybody and has no weaknesses.
@backup368    Im not sure which has sold the most. I know that  as of 2009  tr2 had sold 6.8m copies  which is twice as many as the reboot sold. I know the reboot has a metacritic score of 86 and the original has a score of 91.  literally  you could have debunked your silly claims with a minute or two of research.also  she wasn t a mary sue. I get the feeling you didn t even play the old games.
@jay sullivan  buddy you can google the sales figures. you just dont want to give crystal dynamics   square enix credit for making a change that was needed because the tomb raider formula was getting stale. they explain this in the 30-year crystal dynamics documentary that is right here on youtube.
@planguy  and youre telling me classic lara  had a more in-depth character
@backup368  Im going to tell you that classic lara didn t need more depth to be a better character. new lara uses cheap narrative tricks to appeal to the player.
@backup368   so  how many did itsell if not 3.4m
@jay sullivan  try 14.5  11.8 and 8.9 for the recent trilogy of games.
@planguy  imagine that  they want you to play through the story rather than just wander around in a cave. again  if you ve seen the recent crystal d documentary they explain it in great detail.
@backup368    do yourealize that doesnt even add up to their claim  also  you have decided thatsales equates to likes. ignoring that those games have been given away for free and were published at a time when gaming is exponentially more popular  I d still say ratings are a better metric for pleasure. finally  their claims were based on their own games  not the entire series.
@jay sullivan  the early tomb raider games were on pc  so basically any consumer with a pc could have played it if they didn t have a playstation  saturn  dreamcast  etc. given away for free giving something away for free isn t a sale. if the consumers pays money for it  the consumer bought a copy of it. if you play tomb raider for free with a subscription  you didn t buy it  you bought the subscription instead.
lara
@backup368    what s your point about being on pc  the new games are on pc. they are so loved that 43   46   and then 44  of people who own the steam version beat the games! truly  the game must be phenomenal  do you actually think they dont include those in their numbers  I own multiple copies because epic kept giving it away.
@jay sullivan   I found out how many people on steam actually beat each game! ha! ha! take that! from what I can find. all 3 games have rave reviews on steam. tr 2013    95.03   209 176  8 318rottr   92.62   107 636  6 948sottr   82.67   53 252  10 232anything else
considering the reboot lara is the one I grew up I really dont see what the issue is. lara has been a badass all throughout the series. I dont understand how current lara is any less of a role model.
@backup368    its still the matter that its  so loved  that not even half of the players cared to beat it. if you want to skip that  we cantalk about how steam is simply a   or -  not a score out of 100. therefore  having a 96  could simply mean that 96  of the people think its a 51 100. obviously  metacritic didn t show a 96. we could also address that the first two games both have 86  recommendation and are so old that the games probably dont even work on some systems. there s also the fact that most modern  gamers  cant handle anything challenging. the easiest difficulty of some old games are harder than the hardest difficulty of most new games.its okay that you prefer boring interactive movies starring whiny characters rather than a game that can challenge my young mind. most importantly  I said that they dont like lara  not that they dont like the game. both the old games and the old lara were loved. I haven t heard anyone say they love the new games or the new lara. Ive mostly heard that the new games are pretty good but lara is annoying and itshould have not been a tr title.
@jay sullivan  so much reaching. hope you didn t tear a cognitive tendon with this response.
my roll models are neymar  any dark souls character  and mr. rofl    sir.
imo new lara is way better and more relatable. plus she looks significantly less like a bimbo model than the first model. idk how the first can be remotely relatable especially to today s audience. I think your sister just isn t like the new gen.
how was the new lara a push over  she s incredibly badass in all three games. and yes  she was scared a lot of the times  but her being scared and still facing her fears is way better than her never being scared at all.
@alan ortiz  good point! its definitely more human than the emotionless bimbo in the other games  wouldn t you agree  lmao
@jay sullivan  I love the new lara  as a girl   not sure what youre on about
@alec travis-daugherty  lara croft wasn t a bimbo and pretty sexist to say thatsince your literally saying she wasn t intelligent and just pretty.classic lara is ridiculously intelligent  usually knowing dead languages  she also was an expert in hand to hand combat and all different types of fire arms  a gymnast  and much much more she is basically the female batman.reboot lara is actually pretty but she fits the name bimbo much better. the girl gets beat up all the damn time  cry s all the damn time and is no where near the experience level classic lara is at.
@backup368  also let me just correct a couple thingseach reboot game cost 100 to over 100  million dollars to make literally they had more budget then the tomb raider 2018 movie did.sales might look  high  but none of the game reached sales expectations and took an extremely long time to get high. shadow took forever to get to 8 million while tr1 and 2 didn t take that much time.so square enix sold tomb raider due to numbers and embracer did buy it but are having amazon dump all their money into itso they can see if another reboot game flops.
@alec travis-daugherty  and again let s correct this comment tooreboot lara is actually the bimbo.she is no where near the experience level or book smarts level that classic lara is on but reboot lara is pretty. so she fits the definition of a bimboI know a beautiful powerhouse of a woman is intermediating but let s not just shout out sexist remarks   !
@backup368  yes classic lara did have more in-depth character but all you would have to do is play the games oh youreboot stans lmao.
@backup368  also just watch any of melonies videos why are you any of you here if your just classic haters lmao this is the complete opposite of what melonie thinks
@dominatrix1999  search for my response video  melonie mac downplays success of tomb raider reboot trilogy - crystal d. cant do anything right!
@backup368  honestly no your coming from an extreme bias rather then leaving your personal feelings out the window. square enix sold tomb raider for a reason. embracer wont publish the new tr and are having amazon do it for a reason. embracer knows the history.Imean people literally left the company because 2013 was a flop.rise also didn t meet sales expectations  partly due to it being exclusive  and shadow of the tomb raider couldn t compete with a fucking spider man game . something lara has done easily in the past but reboot couldn t do also do you see how much the reboot games are either on sale or just straight up free from crystal dynamics. thats not good when a company has to give literal free hand outs of a triple a title. Imean tomb raider is currently a joke rn.
@backup368  a lot of reboot sales aren t even pure sales like any of the past tomb raider games are. also if you want to talk numbers factually speaking the biggest revenue of any tomb raider game was tomb raider 1 back in 96. also the best reviewed tomb raider game was back in 1996. and to top it off angelina jolie didn t have her sequel movie canceled. so let s not compare classic era to reboot era because classic was the most successful era and thats factually speaking by the numbers.
@dominatrix1999  tomb raider 2013 sold 14.5 million copies. if the game started at only  15 msrp  itstill would have made a profit. a 100-million dollar budget is the norm for aaa titles today. I explain this in my video but there are other square enix games that are much bigger  had longer development times and sold fewer copies like kingdom hearts 3 and final fantasy 7 remake. those games are getting sequels of course while they sold off their only profitable ip. of course you ignore this.I get how people like you are desperate to want the old tomb raider back. there was a reason why it had to go away in the first place.
@dominatrix1999  square enix is one of the publishers that often discounts their games. they re discounted right now. they must not be selling well  right  melonie mac doesnt care what the reasoning is. she just wants the classic tomb raider with a 1d character and little to no story.and  the tomb raider 2 movie was cancelled due to a rights dispute with mgm. but you didn t want me to figure that out  right  the 2018 movie actually made more money than the cradle of life but yeah  failure failure failure as you say.
@backup368  so 1. doesnt matter what you say factually speaking square enix got rid of tomb raider because of the poor sales of the recent reboot. they were dumping alot of money and their wasn t big profit at all. they sold tomb raider due to reboot2. tomb raider cradle of life actually made more domestically then tomb raider 2018  tomb raider 1 did the same amount as 2018 however if your not an idiot when you compare movie sales you gotta adjust for inflation so tomb raider with angelina blew the 2018 movie out of the ball park. angelina was able to get a sequel and they wanted her to do more after cradle of life but she declined hence why they needed to reboot the movie. if angelina would ve stayed in the role we wouldn t even be talking right now lmao. also gk films their is a reason they didn t pursue a tomb raider movie immediately  it only broke even so they were really keen on continuing reboot lara s story which is why its getting another reboot lmao. the first time was due to angelina simply not wanting to do more the second time was due to the studio not really wanting to do it.3. didn t seem to address the fact that embracer doesnt even want to publish the new tomb raider game just in case its a disaster like the reboots have been.4. also didn t touch upon the fact that the most profitable and most critically acclaimed tomb raider game is the first one . 5. phew the fact that you think the reboot is good storytelling . yea lara literally didn t change and it was the same story 3 fucking times. Imean and each game she s still crying and getting beat the fuck up. Imean at least classic lara was actually not only book smart but she could take care of herself and wasn t a fucking bimbo like reboot
@backup368  the fact of the matter is though their isn t an argument. reboot has a pretty bad rep around it Imean the devs have literally had to apologize to classic fans which that was fucking hilarious. the numbers square enix straight up sold tomb raider because they weren t satisfied and people were leaving the company  literal article out their confirming this  and embracer saw that and wasn t satisfied.also the first time the reboot tomb raider the legend era didn t finish all the way up until 2015 6 with lara croft relic run. so while the the survivor era was happening they still needed a more classic larasince 2020 almost all projects collaborations  even the fuck escape room revolve around a more classic lara. but go on say how she isn t needed also if youreally want to dig into it. lara croft go relic run destoryed reboot in sales due to multiple factors so pshhhh .
@dominatrix1999   1. doesnt matter what you say factually speaking square enix got rid of tomb raider because of the poor sales of the recent reboot. they were dumping alot of money and their wasn t big profit at all. they sold tomb raider due to reboot so do tomb raider games require a budget and are their rpgs that take around 10 years to make just grown from a tree  is that how it works  no. the real reason is probably because they were ashamed to have this western ip perform better than final fantasy and dragon quest. funny how they just coincidentally sold tomb raider and its associated studios once the series surpassed dragon quest in lifetime sales. funny. 2. tomb raider cradle of life actually made more domestically then tomb raider 2018  tomb raider 1 did the same amount as 2018 however if your not an idiot when you compare movie sales you gotta adjust for inflation so tomb raider with angelina blew the 2018 movie out of the ball park. angelina was able to get a sequel and they wanted her to do more after cradle of life but she declined hence why they needed to reboot the movie. if angelina would ve stayed in the role we wouldn t even be talking right now lmao. also gk films their is a reason they didn t pursue a tomb raider movie immediately  it only broke even so they were really keen on continuing reboot lara s story which is why its getting another reboot lmao. the first time was due to angelina simply not wanting to do more the second time was due to the studio not really wanting to do it. so because they found out thatshe wasn t going to be involved that they decided to rewrite the entire script  no. the script was already written. why do only domestic sales matter  3. didn t seem to address the fact that embracer doesnt even want to publish the new tomb raider game just in case its a disaster like the reboots have been. because embracer doesnt publish games.  4. also didn t touch upon the fact that the most profitable and most critically acclaimed tomb raider game is the first one .  source  trust me! 5. phew the fact that you think the reboot is good storytelling . yea lara literally didn t change and it was the same story 3 fucking times. Imean and each game she s still crying and getting beat the fuck up. Imean at least classic lara was actually not only book smart but she could take care of herself and wasn t a fucking bimbo like reboot  yeah  wow. tragedy happened to her. clearly you didn t play any of the newer games. you probably didn t read about any origin story  for that matter.
@dominatrix1999   the fact of the matter is though their isn t an argument. reboot has a pretty bad rep around it Imean the devs have literally had to apologize to classic fans which that was fucking hilarious. the numbers square enix straight up sold tomb raider because they weren t satisfied and people were leaving the company  literal article out their confirming this  and embracer saw that and wasn t satisfied. they weren t satisfied that tomb raider made more money  sold more copies and took far less time to make each game compared to their  epic  rpgs. they cant even afford to make a proper switch port for a game that was originally for the ps2 but yeah  its all lara s fault! also the first time the reboot tomb raider the legend era didn t finish all the way up until 2015 6 with lara croft relic run. so while the the survivor era was happening they still needed a more classic lara you dont even know what youre talking about. relic run is part of the  lara croft  spinoff games. I dont get what the problem is. classic lara did not retire. good Lord. since 2020 almost all projects collaborations  even the fuck escape room revolve around a more classic lara. but go on say how she isn t needed  where did I say she was not needed  nintendo didn t completely do away with green elf link after botw. he is part of the retail decor at the nintendo world store. also if youreally want to dig into it. lara croft go relic run destoryed reboot in sales due to multiple factors so pshhhh . source  trust me!

@melonie mac go boom  still on my image
hell Im getting over the fact of a 5 layer burrito fleshlight I had no idea. lol
@grimwolf lvl99999  wait..what !  wtf! !
@grimwolf lvl99999  well now I know what I want for Christmas.
@grimwolf lvl99999  ayo what !
seriously
soo giggly
with a price tag of 2800 dollars... kinda cheap all things considered.
no kidding  who needs a real woman when these things exist
@raximus3000  cheaper than real woman too  p
@korn66  thats crazy
@korn66  and higher quality than most to boot
looks like game lara which didn t really look real to begin with
yeah  not really. as an ex-owner of  a doll  I cantell you confirm that the pictures are surely doctored to an extent. I cant tell if its cgI  a real-life model heavily photoshopped or the actual doll is photoshopped to be looking more life-like  but the product you get isn t exactly the same.
@andrewik  newer dolls look like their picture equivalents. hope you know that.
yes you wouldn t believe how realistic they make them these days.check out the real dolls. just saying
you say cupsize e is realistic on a 5ft girl ! .. seriously.
@dreez76  I didn t mean in terms of proportions. just in overall human-likeness
sad isn t it
that is actually true.
one cater to the customer while the other one is messing around.
its all the love and coom we got for her
r34 products often have way more effort put into representing canon and faith in the source material than any movie or mainstream story these days. r34 products realize the money to be made is in representing what people want. the world is indeed a twisted parody anymore.
theres an old brick n morar video gsame story in new york city  not sure if its there anymore  thatsold vintage games and stuff and in their front window they had a life size lara croft figure.  p cool
@enclavefakesoldier  what s sad is thinking this is the appropriate care of the brand.  if tomb raider turned into those hentaI dating game  you would be asking what the hell they were doing.
@questworldmatrix  true. but the bar has been set so low that the hentaI dating game would be considered a masterpiece.or a  so bad its good  deal.
lara has been one of my waifu back in legends timeline and whoever butchered her franchise with sjw s bs will taste the same medicine back except in opposite ways.
@red hakiim  yeah instead of foisting ugly milquetoast women onto us we ll bury them alive in gorgeous women who are badass.
I think she does.
@dillydilly  hmmmm!  I would like to see this.
@dillydilly  they do actually have tifa and aerith ones. haha!
save on g fuel using code mac
@dillydilly  they already exist  same maker
@dillydilly  and they are extremely well made. like tifa dressed as cammy. real women should be afraid by what the future offers for men. this stuff is gonna fulfill peoples fantasy from what Im seeing. good Lord!
@dillydilly  hahah! I can only imagine they have rey. Im surprised they are allowed to get away with this stuff. they also gave mama from death stranding and that one is based off a real person.
@dillydilly  exactly! so get to making those android waifus elon! haha!
you know if you ignore the fact that its a doll designed to have sex with then it would actually make a pretty dope display piece to put in your gamer room.
I d get a wrestling ring for it and practice some macho man elbow drops off the top rope and some kane flying clotheslines.
generally the case sadly.
@dillydilly they do have tifa s s  doll or should we call modern day phrase  lovedoll . there s also cirI s version and oh damn  I wish I can bought it. she looks realistic asf like came straight from the game.
@dillydilly  already donne  they even have a 100 cm model
it was an adventure to make
I replayed several times.
@crimzon nova  I couldn t because I was laughing out loud at work the first time through
good thing she wasn t doing this live  or bad thing  depending on your point of view
right ! my lifesize lara statue was 2 000 dollars and it is not nearly as detailed as this lol!
@melonie mac go boom  hey  the customers of these products want only the best. there s a lot of competition now in the schmex doll industry. I remember hearing about them and how they cost like  20k back in the 2000s but now you can get this high a quality for 3k!  not that I would ever buy this thing. I dont like the newest lara. what you will notice from each reboot is how she s gotten progressively uglier with each sequel in the reboot series.
Im 47 with a a wife and kids. Im not ashamed to say that if I was single I would get one in a heartbeat. it would be fun to play with.
where does the shame come from  could it be the real women that want you to want them instead of being content with a doll and your hobbies
@johnny kush  good point  it would be more shameful to live your life based on how strangers might react.
samus with the suit
if I had money falling out of my ass and a place to store  her  where no one would ever see .. shitttt  Im single tho  if that wasn t obvious   if I had a partner then never
when its a robot that can clean itself   make you a cuppa tea sure ...... but until then nope  d
@lewis benzie  thats  140k
@samael just dress her up  put her in the corner of your room  and have her do a pose from the game.  tell people she s just a display piece. they ll probably never suspect what its actually intended for lol.
without going into specifics  my gf and I have already done something both sexy and tomb raider related. no  it wasn t cosplay or role-playing. but my point is  that was a sexier and more fulfilling experience than anything tr related porn or a full-size masturbator could provide. that would certainly be the least interesting part of owning this doll. I think it would look neat in anyone s tr collection.
imagine getting the samus aran doll with the power suitstill thinking after all this time it was a male underneath it
dont judge me lol
why not both
@ian new yasha  my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
I dont get it either. the fun is hearing the screams and panic  feeling the desperate struggle and the cold sweat and begging. no doll or machine can replace that
@misterlau  still cheaper than a wife.
@blox117  at least not until they equip these dolls with realistic a.i. then you ll never know the difference.
its the dying an untimely death while owning this doll or any dolls  the horror my family would go through finding such a thing xd
Ive tried it. not this doll  a somewhat cheaper one  but still very realistic looking. I didn t even get it because I dont have sex with real women  I just wanted to try something different.but  its kind of eerie. it almost tricks your brain into thinking its a real person  but then yourealize it doesnt move  or reacts in any way  and the illusion breaks.after trying it out a few times  I felt gross. its too weird. so I dismantled it and threw it out.
yeah a life size samus aran with the varia suit.
@mr. joe dirt  yikes
tells you a lot about today s world that I thought it was some kind of nft or crypto thing when I heard it.
yeah  I thought its a real edgy name for company producing dolls
to be honest  I had to put in earphones  listen a couple of times  then look words up.  her reactions are greatness.  if there s ever a  best of  reel of mel  her reactions in this one will surely be in it.
yeah  me too.
I guess sinning too
how is itsin
@joven c  its technically a sex doll.
@john  ok  and
I certainly prefer the older look  including the older cd games. however  we shouldn t pretend as if the games would become great if the avatar was more feminine-looking and cocky. I d rather keep the current lara and have the game change than have the old lara and the new gameplay.
she s actually adorable  hopefully they will keep these designs for games and make lara the confident and nonchalant shooter we all know her to be.
are we going to start a gofundme so we can buy this for melonie to review! ! ! lol
Imean  2800 is way cheaper than the average wedding. she also will never nag  manipulate or betray you. sounds like a good deal to me!
your accidental  omg!  was pretty funny! to be honest and I am speaking both analytically and literally that I can see this  pleasure doll  having more practical uses. especially if I got bored and wanted to learn  create and test aesthetically pleasing attire than some of the impractical styles that fashion shows are known to use. Imean I am going to have to be pretty wealthy to get one if I did have uses for something like fashion if thats field part of my future.
mel two thing 1. you should totally get this just as a high detail poseable lara statue2. definitely reupload this video cause this version could get you in big trouble with youtube. there s blatant flash frames of full nudlty in this
omfg she s so pretty lol! they even gave her the dual guns and belt...wtf is this world coming to  ! I feel like shadow could have had some great outfits and boosted her confidence but they shot her way down    I want the next lara to be classic lara. end of ! no more  rebooting  !
from a production standpoint that doll is very well made. the reaction was quite funny as well.
lara attending parties using her charms   scholarly background to sway rich businessman and gaining access to high security areas with the help of her tiny robots to scan and spy on people and places  yeah thats all the tomb raider I know a lot about. I still play the 2013 game.I like the locations that the game is set  the atmosphere especially the tone and mood of it all  the horror elements to it  and the character model of lara looks zoomed in like she s a bit taller and dare say stronger looking. its especially fun when you play that game just walking and looking with a lot of fighting like melee  guns etc I dont like the next two games at all.
I dont even want to imagine the review section on  shmex  dolls.itseems like it d be both disturbing and hilarious.
finally the tomb raider we deserve
well... only one way to find out if the price is worth it
honestly this may be your best video yet. just for your reaction to the subject matter. its just so adorable mel.
if I was rich I d buy one for melonie to see the reaction
melonie s reactions are the best. especially when she kept accidentally going to the wrong screen.
we wanna show the world what a real strong woman looks like! creates a whimpering scared little bunny rabbitthey ve actually become the thing they sought to destroy.
never once in my life have I ever thought about buying a doll... until now. damn you for tempting me with lara croft!
once I saw they released this I wonder what melonie s thoughts would be.
actually really surprised with the quality  practically a life size action figure. as an art nude photographer this would be an excellent test model.
I wish they would make lara croft great again.  when the reboot of tomb raider came out many of us were under the impression that this was lara croft before she started her ways of becoming a sexy adventurer.  I enjoyed the first two reboots  but the 3rd is boring.  I was hoping by the 3rd installment that lara croft was going to become her classic self.
let s be real  we know what the ad revenue for this video will be buying!
perfect  erm  platform for testing your cosplay iterations...  genius idea!
@falcon_by_the_lake  I am saying if I did get one. I dont have the coin to spend on a lot  much less this....pleasure doll. besides I am taken to start with and with her connections in the music scene it has helped uplift my goals I couldn t have done on my own and I am. something this doll could never provide.
@m3tr01d86  roger that  and best of luck to the both of ya!
@falcon_by_the_lake  thank you
I think the intended use is pretty practical.
@johnny kush  dude  there are cheaper ways for that type of reason. just saying and this is coming from someone that is litteraly almost the same age as melonie by just days apart.
there s a couple people on instagram that do photography. one is dee s doll house. obviously has different looks too. but if you like photography at all it could be viable. wouldn t have to worry about someone real holding a pose and needing to like scratch an inch or something.
@joey dahl                                                         this guy has the right idea. it may be pricey  but if you do photography that way think smarter not harder.
I ll see if I cantrim it out in the editor lol!!! Imissed that
@melonie mac go boom cant  believe this is my first comment on your channel  but figured I d let you know its possible to pause at the right couple of frames to see the picture. its at 2 21 might be difficult to do anything beyond that though  as a smaller version of the picture is visible for quite a while before and after that.either way  really enjoy your videos!
@melonie mac go boom  if you have access to premiere pro  adobe  or at least imovie  that might help.  but Ive never used the built in editor in yt and maybe that might work best.  with pp and imovie you would have to re-upload.
coom raider
womb raiders  rise!
poon raider.
its a trap
no returns!
it cant divorce you and take half your money...
get her that remote control 1974 mechaGodzilla too
the exact same thoughts she must of had about the tifa jako lantern pose figure. haha!
I feel they made less pretty in each game after the first reboot Ive seen woman who plays her she is very pretty imo and purposely made the made  based  on her to look way less attractive than her
@ian mayer  just like mass effect andromeda
rise   reboot   shadow   old school  old lara s faces are buttugly
mel  laughs real hard for videomel after video  vigorously deletes search history  destroys pc for good measure.
were you afraid that your parents were going to storm in and be like  melonie what on earth are you doing.   it does look like a young lara croft. sounds like a lot of implants. you look wonderful melonie. love your hair. have a good fun day.
thats pretty sad when a doll like that looks better than the actual game.
we like to refer to them as companion dolls on the channel. yes  they have many use and we dont deny that fact. but the same as when you have a human parter  many doll owners see their doll as more than just an object to play with. think about it  spending thousands of dollars for that Im sure future doll owners of this one will also treat her like the queen she is.
you are adorable.  such intense reactions to a doll. I could pinch your cheeks.also  you need that doll added to the collection behind you. power move  plus a great visual reminder that the desexualization of characters is and always will be a lie from these companies.
wow it looks great. if only I could actually afford that. lolalso love that they gave her the reboot face but let her body be as feminine and sexy as original lara croft. best of both worlds.
wow  they got one with her regular fit too  very impressive looking in all seriousness  if they had one with the voice and reactions id be sold
its just a life size statue I swear!
loved your reactions when you have to censor the video  and the fact that you used  that  statue to cover things  . Im shocked there wasn t one of these already  lol.
a part of me wants melonie to start a gofundme for that doll  it would be hilarious. its a great character model and would actually look cool... she d have to change the clothes though. as a statue its kind of worth lol
I went to their site before starting the video to see what the pricing was  and honestly  for how ludicrous it is  at least Im assuming 2800 for a sex doll is insane  I dont know the market   what horrified me most is how many different video game character they have. melina  tifa  aerith  2b  I guess this one was to be expected ... and some of those have more than 5 different versions  think poses  in case you cant tell why .I honestly dont know what to think.
that is insane! but  knowing her history and the love of lara croft fans everywhere  we are not totally surprised. Imean for an e-cup gal  standing 5 ft 5 for only  2799 right now  thatsounds like a steal when comparing her to some ladies irl.
go boom  just took a whole new meaning in this video.
welp  if thats what the gents  and probably some ladies  want  then have at it. if ol laura is out here helping the gents  and maybe some ladies  keep their heads clear so they can focus on bettering themselves  then I say she s doing the Lord s work and I wish everyone  involved in this  the best.
sometimes  not often  but sometimes  the temptation itself brings me shame.
I want to point out one thing. we see more  corn  of lara now cause the graphics now are much more realistic than when they were before and these types of renders animations are selling better than before.
I am very confused  very confused. Ive always wanted a 1 1 figure of lc in my apartments like the terminator t-800 and sam fisher from splinter cell. the asking price is far less than the actual price for a really good-quality statue. the question is would they make one without the temptation o s. I would seriously consider having one as a statue in my apartment. what s the longevity of the medical-grade silicone material   I need to investigate further.
clicking a randomly recommended vid for the schmexy thumbnail  I was very pleasantly surprised at your take   a 100  legit pitch for having more franchise integrity.  subbed
oh melonie  I never know what Im going to get when I watch. its like a train wreck... just without death and replaced with laughs.
wow that is a great product. its not up my alley but thats fine craftsmanship right there!if it wasn t for the price this would be the ultimate action figure imo  isn t it life sized  how could you not want this  even if you dont want to  hit it
and melonie almost showed some naughty stuff. good save melonie.
calm down  the hussy isn t going to sleep with you.
damn you!
1 34 your laugh and reaction here was perfect xd
to tell you the truth  they do put some good work into these statues dolls. I will always make jokes about these  but it is a good buy for a collector. Im really not shocked that they made it
they ve been making these for while now  there s a jill valentine version too. according to the news  smex bolls are big with the pelosI family. makes a great x-mas gift for the grandkids!
its just the times -- if original lara came out now  there definitely would be a booming doll business in her proportions.
that doll is definitely realistic  and reboot lara looks like she s hit the wall hard.
the only thing I canthink of that would be cool is for photography. I dont know how this type of . . . product is outside or if its only for indoor. but you could probably get some dope photos especially if you already have guns and bows. the size would be better for photos since 6th scale stuff would be a little bit harder to capture as well. but still pretty doable. thatsaid  unless you are a massive fan that price tag ain t worth it.
hey melonie! your videos are a bright spot in my days. hope you are having a blessed day.  edit  omg melonie is so cute today!!!
okay  I dug out this video from my history to raise the real problem here. the manufacturer  game lady  has released a few video game dolls  including  but not limited to  lara croft  ada wong and jill valentine. the reason Im singling out these 3 is that these I know for a fact were motion captured and face capture of models actresses. in other words  one day youre getting your face scanned to be imported into a video game  a few years later dudes around the world are banging dolls that have your head on. I feel like there s some ethical line being crossed here.
I love the idea of you starting to record the video when suddenly you can just feel judgment from the other room.
you should play her in an upcoming movie and   or game !
you know Im actually more surprised it took this long for them to make a lara croft love companion.
that moment when a sexdoll company does laracroft more justice than the hacks in charge of the ip...
such a steep price but dang it looks good
I look at this doll and keep thinking  hey that would make for a great lara croft decoration in my gaming room!  Imean  actual decoration figures rarely come in these sizes... but... does she come with all the gear on the pics  like all the guns
yes Ive been looking forward to this. hey melonie
honestly  Im surprised it took this long for this to be a real thing.
your reactions are everything
lara croft doll  now I know what I want for Christmas
men of culture. we meet here once again.
finally! more tomb raider stuff. now to watch the show.
btw what ever happened to that fear effect reboot game
@budgie cat  not sure. will have a look later.
someone asking the important question!
it d be a major flex if mel would replace the prop pistols with real ones.
@falcon_by_the_lake  I d definitely do that.
your reactions in this video are so funny.
indeed we have lol
loooool
@melonie mac go boom  love from pittsburgh pa from a college student during finals week!
I just hope this isn t the last big product of  hq  from the lara croft ip  I dont even know how that doll can even exist... like  crystal dynamics  afaik  did really made a temp. contract with them to be able to make a product like that  its hard to know for sure.crystal dynamics should take seriously their gamer fans  know that there are mentalities that do not think in favor of gamers and fun but money  from the wrong hands  and disrespect.thanks for the video melonie! had fun with the jokes and the video-editing!
now we can finally be with lara croft!
when melonie goes to a shm3xh doll site but its for actual research purposes. watching you try to navigate this minefield is hilarious.
maybe one day  personalities will start releasing their own doll line...
now if the Godzilla one drops youre all set!    Im kidding of course.
gamelady has two lara croft  dolls  - fully functional been saving my pennie s - Im going with the ellie from loubeen out for a while now haha
fun fact melonie. first time I heard of such things it was a witcher one  ciri. no context on the photo of it with a full costume  and it was a case of  hell yeah sign me... up... since Im currently living in a shared house I cant get it for a badass display piece.
they made one based on the movie lara croft.  you should look that one up  it is kind of creepy.
not just lara  theres tifa  aerith and yuna too. its freakin shm3xh doll Christmas over there
you just exploded thatsite s revenue   and they re definitely sold out now  mel
the giggles   adorable.
the fans always provide the best quality content.
that is actually rather good. looks very accurate and  to quote fat bastard of austin powers fame  Jesus Christ  she s tiny. classic lara was close to about 6 ft I believe as she was about the same height as larson or even cowboy. but even so  what is wrong with lara looking sexy and curvy  that comes along with confidence. but still the face looks a little too young and it is a bit worrying but maybe Im reading too much into it.
Im so sheltered  it took me a good while to figure out what  shm3xh  meant
1 18melonie s parents  oh  its probably one of those japanese action figure things  again. you know her and her shows.melonie  ...exactly.
fun fact  the huge bazoonkas that lara croft had in the original games were an error in programing  someone put an extra 0 where they shouldn t and the biggest sex icon in gaming was born
please buy it for the memes!
Im dumb because when I saw the title my first thought was  oh shm3xh must be a collectible company like threezero or hot toys that I haven t heard of.  lmao I think with  2800  being a reasonably handsome dude  I could find a date  use that money for dates  date for less than a month  and have a girl wear a lara croft outfit for me. plus I d have money left over  despite the odd looks from her for thatspecific request  depending on how cool she is .
those toys are  interesting  to say the least - I bet maintaining and cleaning them regularly is going to be  fun  if youre using it as  intended .    on a lighter note  thats one helluva 1 1 realistic action figure if you put it in those terms.  all jokes aside  the lara croft   doll looks to be very well made - the manufacturers nearly did away with the obvious seam lines.
its not a doll  dad. its an action figure!
kin kong
excuse me the what
watching your reaction to this was so fun!
that is an amazingly well crafted doll o.o
well Ive been meaning to say thanks for the diet advice .  been losing weight and felling pretty good.  but I definitely couldn t let this one pass without a comment.   so I was at work logged into my google account.  the it guy was working on my laptop when this video dropped.  dont know why notifications where on.  seen it was you and didn t worry much  until I saw the title.  it guy just looked at me   I just shrugged laughing. it was pretty funny.  you are a bit of an enigma sometimes.  anyways great video and thanks for the fun day.
thanks mel for this video it made my day very entertaining
we know what you did melonie. respect.
still cant get over how the  updated for modern audiences  lara looks like melonie
melonie would certainly be a very nice lara croft  she should make some cosplay  we would certainly love it!
pretty sure this woman could be the character model for lara croft. my God lol
dang  real dolls have come a long way since the first started  not sure if this is a real doll  wasn t paying attention .I remember telling friends about how sad it is that we live in a society where something like that exists.... and then someone  married  their real doll.itseems we can always fall lower.
this is actually really cool as a collectors item. too bad its a smexdoll  now I have to contemplate if Im a big enough fan to buy this
today on unusual euphemisms with melonie   she can go...look for underwater artefacts.
if you want a classic version of lara  rlsd has a lara kroft doll.
id totally buy that doll if I had the money its like having a life size collectible action figurine and maybe its way cheaper than having someone build a statue for me
I looked for the link as soon as she said it. I just wanted to see how many people were donating  I swear
classic lara looked and acted like someone that would break your arm if you tried something stupid. the reboot lara looks like a chick that gets killed in the beginning of a movie.
remember when capcom did the same exact thing to chris redfield  yeah  they knew we d never forgive them for that and it made capcom get their act together and change him back. albeit  not exactly to the re5 chris who looks like a chia pet on top of a refrigerator but they changed him a respectable amount in re village.
the art looks good  at least  if that doll looks anything like the art  I ll eat my shoe
if you do get it you could design her own outfits.  just an idea
thank you for bringing this to light. Imay have to do some research.
she looks so different even from the last movie they did... with alicia vikander more anime resident evil remake style and more latina... she kinda looks more like a dolled-up and younger shakira or someone like her.
rofl oh noooo  big congrats on the diet progress btw!
just wait until we get sex bots lol
its sad that we live in a world where real women are so bad that things like this even need to exist
melonie thoughts on the director days gone john garvin saying that the game did not get good reviews because of woke reviewers
lmao. melonie s reactions. melonie  you can buy different clothes and dress her like you want.
on the one hand  its a long-held fantasy for many of us to diddle lara croft.  on the other hand  the sense of shame and crippling debt that would follow paying for this and actually diddling the doll would be unbearable.  buyer s remorse  and all that.
that does not look like any lara croft Im fond of.  she looks like a run-of-the-mill model who is cosplaying her.
next week   the new lara croft doll sold more than 250.000 already  you all know that its gonna happen
thank you for the news  not quit cheap but it could be worth it
still cheaper than a real girlfriend
is it wrong for me to want to get this doll  maybe not  Ive played lara croft since the begining  and to have a doll like this in my game room would be cool!
imagine being so thirsty that you need a life size doll of lara croft... runs to his dakimakura for comfort
classic lara doll would sell like hotcakes - God help us all.
that looks really good. I wonder if they would sell one without the naughty bits  I just want her chilling in my game room. maybe they would do a ps1 blocky lara version.
I would definitely love to do some tomb  exploring  with this lara..
anyone who paused at the 2 21 mark has earned  3 internet points for today.
dude  your reactions are priceless!
the best part of this is watching your reaction to it lol
my long awaited dream finally came true  and I cant even buy her  because my girlfriend wont let me
Im getting one! but only because I want a life size laura. thats literally the only reason.........
if this is from a japanese company that may explain the  e cup  label.  I believe their cup sizes are smaller than western countries.  Im a male living in america so I cant say for sure thats the case but I believe Ive heard that before.   no  dont ask me where I heard that. lol
I dont think women understand they are going to be replaced with sex dolls and toys. they have ruined dating with their embarrassing unrealistic standards and think they are all princesses.
sex doll or not it would be awesome to have that in your room as one of those life size figures.for example look at those big star wars statues of darth vader you can get that ppl have its practically the same you just dont use the dolls  features
he isn t wrong. jeff ross  days gone other games developer was able to look at these reviewers trophy data because at sony you cantrack trophys. he looked into if these reviewers unlocked the games ending trophy. and obviously they didn t. so they never finished the game.  but yet reviewed it and gave it a score.
I hate that you aren t wrong
correct
and she doesnt talk back or argue with you and is reusable. I dread to think how much of a pain it is to clean up though! hahaha!
and less of a headache
@enclavefakesoldier  ooooh thats a spicy meatball sir. I like it
took a few tries but I pulled it off
setting it to .25 speed makes it easier
Imean  now you have to do it. it would be the best poseable decoration you could possibly own.
I clicked on this video to find out what a  shm3xh  doll is... I thought it was like a funkopop or something. found out its something even better!
just hearing that is jaw dropping
its not even ok how good it looks. people could totally use this for toy photography... well  toy I like the point youre making
shmex dolls are just creepy af in general.
love it  dont ever change miss mac
whats hilarious about this is that there was such a huge uproar when the first reboot tomb raider came out  when the main character lara was  sexually  assaulted in the game  I say it like that because in fact she was being tortured  nothing even remotely sexual happened to her  and yet the outrage was insane  now they are making a sex doll of her  and I cant help but laugh
not lara croft we needed but the lara croft we deseve.
I want one  ! it would be a great action figure !
I didn t realize what kind of doll it was until I looked it up on google
that look on reboot lara s face next to previous lara says  come on  can you please like me  dont you want to play as me  pleeeease  Im cool and confident too...right
you should totally buy itso you can have two lara statues lol
I discovered your channel the other day and if I am correct you are a football fan  gamer  dragonball fan  Christian and antI woke I think I found the female version of myself
not surprised melonie is aware of rule34 trends  must be an avid researcher
so I just saw a melonie mac video and lara croft in the title and like how you talk about lara so clicked it. now Im wondering why Im watching a video about a  pleasure  doll
I wonder who d be the best live action lara croft today... if we re casting for the original lara
kind of funny  had this idea of doing  game ladies  of silicone. but then I thought there would be a problem with the copyright and stuff  but they ve got around it calling it a cosplay lmao.
is it licensed   trademarked by the copyright owners though is this an  official  lara croft dna collection device
I thought this was about an action figure and was super excited....then was disappointed  and then was excited again lol.
we live in a time where kim kardashian is more unrealistic than lara croft
the amount of money the makers will have by the end of thatsale streak is going to let them pull a scrooge mcduck in real life.
am I a horrible person for checking if the gofundme was in the description before melonie even finished the statement
see most people want a date with mel mel  I just wanna play an online game with her and friends. thatsounds like a blast man! and this lara croft doll sounds insane . yo look  if we see this in the background of her next video we know great video as usual mel!!
wow melonie this new lara croft doll looks awesome and I like your video looks really good too
thatside-by-side picture really illustrates just how far the  artists  have gone to strip away the pretty feminine sexy look of classic lara. its as if neil druckman designed her. the snarky smirk  butched out jawline  reduction of the curves.... is so far removed from the original lara. the doll looks like a hybrid of the new and old.
I hope you buy it mel. I really do. lol
dont worry the lara croft reboot is basically a younger lower crop in her beginning journeys because they re making a new lara croft game which she s much older which people been demanding the more mature looking original classic lower croft video game
this made me lol so hard. if you only knew my dear  if you only knew...... xd the rabbit hole goes pretty deep
holy shit Imight just buy thatshe looks just like lara in the reboot rise of the tr. wth
the lara croft from tomb raider 2013 is imo the best version of lara   great game as well.when it comes to the doll  I d say that any person who fantasizes about e-size cup got some issues to deal with.
you had way too much fun with this!
do be fair rule 34 has existed for laura forever. the dolls have only in the last few years gotten to this level of realism.you could also contact the company and ask them to produce one without the extra  features  that one would normally want.
looks like its based off rhona mitra when she was modeling as lara.. nice
looks like Christmas is coming more than once this year.
yay! I got my order in! woohoo!!
an unexpected surprise  but a pleasant one nonetheless.
bwhaahahahhahahah!!!! Im dead!!!! laughed throughout the whole vid! its funny that you act as if you never saw adult content before and that you did  accidental scrolling . a great change of pace from the vids talking about wokies and woke stuff  although those vids are super good too. this vid made me laugh so hard and it made my day.
I should not have googled.  there are more than one of those shm3xh dolls out in the market place.  I need to go to church in the morning.
now just add a robot skeleton and chatgpt bot trained to act like lara to her and we have real-life lara croft .... or a female terminator xd
oh its on sale!!!
one step closer to getting real robot waifus...
y know  shoutout to you if you buy  the doll unironically xd Lord knows I would not be brave enough to have one of these in my room xd but its the best thing to og lc as we re ever gonna get these days.
its not a shm3xh doll! its an action figure
this is in fact a win for the entire ecosystem of culture. not for me because I have class  and not a lot of money . but a win none the less
surprised this wasn t out years ago
the wet-suit outfit was a classic outfit from the games.
2013 definitive edition looked the best very pretty design
that makikin   shm3xk doll looks really hot. I think it looks very good to match the re-boot lara croft. 9 10 overall. this would be epic as manikin at a gamestop or something to go along with a new tomb raider game release. and yes she would need to wear a bra.
its the wetsuit from underworld. the one you get after you beat the game
I gotta say  you seem to be taking this in good humor. sorry it happened to your girl. they come for everything. at least I dont have to worry about a jc denton schmex doll  yet
the design looks pretty good ngl. its like a better  more curvy  and more feminine version of reboot lara.
I feel so bad for the poor guys that feel the need to buy this stuff.
if I had money to buy it   yeah I d probably buy it lol
finally been waiting for this for a while now
be careful what you ask for  I have a feeling people would be willing to buy her for you! lol
hey guys remember how in the 90s you wanted her ! now she can be yours!
I never played the old games so I like her look from the new games. based I know.
I lowkey want you to buy it. just so I can see itside by side with the statue. lol
I actually want one of these things for a few minutes. they ve gotten to the point where they actually look realistic. but you have to think they cant feel real. Im willing to bet the thing just feels like plastic.
an unlockable in underworld  the classic one was the sola blue  gray wetsuit
yeah it does look like that one! I like it haha
source crowded 2000 bucs is not much of a deal. it would be worth it for the memes alone
it feels real. do your research.
@upstar21t  uh I literaly said I wanted to. do try paying attention.
@nooctip  Im just telling you they dont feel like plastic  thats all brah  its all good.
3k for a doll  you better save up for a house instead.
great job square   if we thought laura getting dropped for crypto that bottomed out after trade now she will come life size  watch out for official  croft manner gear for ur doll.hahaha  umm heck at this point I wouldn t be surprised if they did clothes
something I never realised I needed  raiding piggy bank now
I ll say this... it ll be a walk in the park  more than usual  for lara croft to take down whoever  because they ll have plenty to be distracted by. lol
lol melonie is so innocent and cute
mel.. we need to have a talk about why your shopping cart had 4 items in it. and not to mention that twitter thread.
never joke about starting a gofundme for something like this. because given how crazy the internet can be you might wind up with one of these showing up at your door.
I cant say Im surprised. this is honestly way past due for that particular industry to have made by now. most of us have long grown up and settled down since those early days of her first  and later games . I suppose this just goes with the typical standard thats been out there thatsomehow the   rn parodies and cosplayers are more visually accurate than the hollywood movie versions.
melonie  and the  lara croft doll . now thats a party!!!!
I still remember they rather give us the original low poly version of classic lara instead of a remake classic outfit in newer games just out of spite.
the ultimate collector s item.
looks like I know what my wife can get me for Christmas
kinda off-topic  but melonie s views on modern tomb raider echo my views on modern God of war. as a long-time gow fan  I initially loved the re-imagining in 2018  but the more I saw of it  the more I realized it lacked so many of the traits I liked in the original series  so much so that the new game  ragnarok  was virtually unrecognizable to me. just like tomb raider  game journos feel like they have to constantly knock the original incarnation to praise the new version. I felt like I was going crazy in thinking the originals were so much better  but then I remembered melonie went through the same thing with tomb raider.
you know you could have just called it a love doll
looked it up  it is real. there are actually 2 different outfits available  the wetsuit and the outfit from 2013 tomb raider.
man  Imay have to check one of these out for  research purposes ...
watching you scroll through the pics was the best  super cute.
Im both confused and greatly saddened Imight be only a  new  lara player but I never saw her as a sex object  contact Ive only play the third I thought it was ok .
I was curious and had to google it. still weird people use these. definitely be awkward if you ordered it and had to explain it to your parents.
at this point melonie  eidos just shown that they are hypocrite. didn t they talk about classic lara was not coming back because of its male gaze  by the way epic rap battle of history release a new rap battle indiana jones vs lara croft. I think you should watch it. trust me  you ll get a good laugh of the way they diss each other in the rap battle.
youre not alone
nah dont worry Im playing the new lara series too on pc and its an amazing game series so far. though Im only almost through the first one. people forget the series was dieing before the reboots - however  we ll see if the new title bombs.
@superflawless9  I was hesitant cause Ive never played a tomb raider game  technical Imight of played a older one but all me and my friend did was try and kill her butler . I played the last one shadow of the tomb raider cause it was on sale and I was given a good recommendation. I did like it beautiful environments and I enjoyed the gameplay the only issue was the exp system  like I had tons of cool weapons but the game really wanted pure stealth for max exp pre encounter which made all those cool weapons I was getting pointless  there was also lara not shutting up when I was trying to solve the puzzles but that might be my brain still running on window vista .
lmao I cant stop laughing!!!
we all know mel preordered at least two of them.
well all I ll say  is it looks better than the actual reboot counterpart!
why am I so depressed that this is literally amazing vs actual statues...a sex doll.. I wanna f cking cry...where s this likeness for respectable statutes..my heart
they do quite a few different game girls. they had yuna from ff10 too  but looks like shes been yeeted.
Im both horrified and delighted.
melonie didn t pre-order it  I cant believe that...
and here I thought I didn t need anything for Christmas.      dear santa...
hey you know what s funny  that doll doesnt actually look like a bad lara!
lol.speaking as a guy  I d sooner spend half that money on a new pimax crystal vr headset and spend the rest on plane tickets to see my family in australia.that doll isn t going to stay in mint condition for long. it wont be bought as a work of art.
166cm  thought lara is taller  maybe modern lara had more than one reduction op...   edit  ha! 5 foot 9 is 175 cm. knew it!
this is going to be funny . cant wait to see the current team struggling to understand why their  non sexualised   lara  could go through such a thing!! come to think of it  why isn t the old design ever as sexualised   is it because she s too mature for young  active  men
literally was starting to type it into search not knowing the brand and then it hit me.
it was the text next to mm s webcam that did me in! its 7  deep  whut  well played m dear! only blushed twice
lara was not just a sex object  she was a badass and a sex icon . the female brad pitt if you will not ironic that the one to go and play lara in film bagged brad pitt in the least
not gonna lie  I want one!!! eagerly awaiting the autonomous  a.I enabled  smex  bots.
this is so much fun.
someone to do a petition  get the original design if enough people sign it its like levels of automan 2 maybe they might change their mind we gotta step up our game and tell them we want the original design if they dont give it to us we just wont give them our money
Im more curious about the legality of this. are they allowed to just make these dolls without the the ip holders consent
the doll is actually very soft on touch  the body is ok  and the face is 90   2010 lara. 4 stars in 5. would sell better with jolies face.
this video is hilarious
lol this vid. I cant decide if Im more surprised you uploaded it or that that thing weighs 93lbs !
Im getting itsoully for the reason thatshe looks like chell from portal 2
your parents are right there  why not ask them for the money to buy the smex doll  Im sure they d understand
im getting heavy grandma s boy vibes right now.
guess she missed a few mods of the games. she s totally gonna buy one
youre reaction s are hilariousnerdrotic says it all the time  they re making women - dudes
Im gonna need that link for research purposes.
cant wait for the future when you can buy robot partners that look like any character you want for 125  from ebay
it only took 26 years  but here we are.
this should have a profound effect on cosplay. lol
they could ve merged new and angelina to make the perfect laura croft. then it might even be worth the price.
going to order one of them right now..
I d pay  2800 for that before I would pay 7k for metallica tickets
this should literally be the ad on their site ...
interesting  I think I know what im gonna offer myself for Christmas
Im not surprised that it did happen. only that it took so long.
go boom. love how much she loves the tomb raider ip
5 foot 5 ! now hang on a minute! she s at least 5 7 in the lore!
you just see 34 type content more of anything now in general not just for lara
only a true fan would spend this much time on laura crofts bodily proportions
I had to look it up for myself and now Im terrified Im gonna start getting ads for sex dolls.
your hair looks great!!! so is your video on lara
wait til you see the tifa and aerith one.
Im pretty sure the modding community will be remedying the lara model in future games. at least for the pc versions. sorry console players
I remember the tracer outrage lol.
I wonder if my wife will let me have one. ill just tell her its a giant action figure
so  what s the deal with sd  they smell good and at least vibrate  there s some sort of sensor to produce sound during the act   cause I cant see the appeal of something that will stay mute and immobile when youre trying... you know... to  raid that tomb  and such.
hey lara croft is a strong  independent woman. not a sex object. internet  hold my beer.
I hate being reminded that the reboot exists. lara was the shit when I was a kid.
its not my life no but I have to admit looking at the pics its pretty dammed impressive.
10 years ago I told people we will have sex dolls after video game character  anime cartoon characters and celebrities. no one believed me.
apparently  the movie rights for tomb raider are up for grabs as mgm let them lapse by not producing the next film in time. so who will make be the next tomb raider
buy it  melonie! do it for the meme!
Imean I like the reboot lara... granted she is heavily desexualized compared to oldschool lara but its not like she s not still hot... she s just slimmer and for me thats my thing so Im good...  in fact I am currently replaying the whole trilogy and I think Im actually having more fun the second time.
better than the last 2 games model
do they make a melonie mac doll  gotta few bob spare.  . love your vids and modesty and your passion for  all  thing s lara.
so it looks someones dream of smashing these characters has now become a reality.
it looks hot but I think I prefer the angelique julie model. classic is better than a remake though. by the way you look great too.
I never would ve known this existed if not for your video. I think you are secretly advertising for them
Im no simp but melonie is the apex desirable woman.
im having them make me a melonie mac version as we speak
technology remains impressively undefeated
classic lara croft   yes treasure hunts for artifacts  my life is danger and adventure I live for this . 2013 lara croft    guh...is it monday...kill me...I hate tomb raiding..quick Im weak I need protection    a few seconds later  .. hah eat sledgehammer  shotgun  pick..hah hah  ..a few more seconds later  ..quick Im weak I need protection ..wah tomb raiding...life is pain..waah..
why is it perverts can make a better lara than the people who are in charge of the real lara  lol
and yes mel  you freaking boom!!!
you should totally get it
for that kind of money I could find a well used toyota  crown vic  or f-150 thatstill has a lot of life left in it. the car or truck is going to have a lot more use and benefit for me than that ever would.
Imight buy one
it would be nice if crystal dynamics make a new lara croft game instead of wasting money making a lara  croft doll
some people actually buy sex dolls for display purposes and or pose them for art projects  etc. there wouldn t be any shame in owning this one  I dont think. Ive certainly seen worse representations of lara.
and its on sale!  lmao
should have went with the 1st reboot from 2015 as the base. thatsaid  who buys smhex dolls  much less for 2800
Im not sure this is what people meant when they said  fuck reboot lara yet here we are
the first real on the nose situation that I noticed a game developer  uglifying  a female character was mass effect andromeda.   one of my favorite game series.
this is only the beginning. where s my jeannie doll on in-game character looks  even lara has outfit options  why not offer say 3 body types and face types if not a full on character creator. oh  thats right  its not about options - but removing our choice s .
I want one.
pc mods are quite a bit more revealing.  but somehow I cant game effectively like that.  I prefer to have more protection.  but I dont want her to look like a dude.  long leather shorts and knee high boots and slap on a skirt and Im good to go.  Im okay if she doesnt wear much on top.  because Im sure she gets hot.  I found that out with kassandra.  I think a key to a successful protagonist is big hair.
I know what mel will get for xmas.
huh. my mom and I talk about our sex lives all the time...but I guess it helps that neither of us have one
its sad when nsfw fanart of lara nekkid is more respectful to the character than this monstrosity
damn thats alot of money....worth it
love your laughter
does her  tomb  have an  exit passage
you see a lot of rule 34 content because the internet  is more accessible these days .
mel s shocked expression is just like me when I found out the shm3x scene in mass effect 3 with mods turn the characters fully nude. and I was streaming it.
there are similar dolls for tifa and ciri. do not ask how I know....my friends told me.
reading e cup  my first thought was rated e for everyone.shoulda been an m cup for mature.I see the door and Im leaving.
door slams open. are you winning daughter
I think the one you have is far better  melonie.
they actually licensed lara for this   thats... disappointing.
well the original lara was rhona mitra  where is her doll  btw  if melonie brings out her own  hope there will be one without all the ink....
we re not buying it melonie  we all know you already have a dozen being shipped to you as we speak.
sydney sweeney for lara croft!
this says more about us as a society then it does reflect the absurdity of the sex doll. the fact thatsex dolls in general exist is a whole other conversation. but the fact that a market is out there for sex dolls that resemble video game characters. is a whole other psychosis and really really tells us that humanity needs help. something has to change. you can argue women are too picky and have a sense of what a man should be based off of fictional checklists. you can argue men just stopped giving a damn and became extremely undesirable. either way for whatever reason you want to put out there. this just shows thatsociety has clammed up way too much and has backpedaled 60 70 years or more.
I think they to stop forcing shamex  and corn on to everyone. thats why most of genz is the way it is.
childhood dream accomplished  only  3 000. cheapest childhood dream I had to pay for.
anyone know much about the new company that owns tomb raider now  they probably are woke but I haven t heard anything about their management yet
so clearly youre adding this to your personal collection right
what I find amusing is the statement that criticizing the old lara as just an object has only increased the objectification of the newer  plain jane  lara. first rule of the internet. dont tell the internet what makes you mad.
rofl!!!!!!
they bought saints row and the last game was so stupid woke and performed terribly. hopefully that taught them a lesson that go woke get broke
@melonie mac go boom  oh wow  just looked into it. youre right. seems the gaming industry is slowly approaching the peak of where the movie industry is at but definitely at a slower pace. I just found out that bend studio of days gone decided to distance themselves from the games ex director for bashing woke critics. not good news for me for whatever game they develop next.  sony needs to head quarter in japan again!
the wokies dont want any imagined vision of beauty  like I honestly dont see the problem in creating a character that is both smoking hot and strong smart at the same time. I have  myself  created characters with something of an unattainable beauty  but never has it ever been to create insecurities in others. I just wanted to create my own idealized version of a beautiful character. beauty is in the eyes of the beholder  so just let people have their creative freedom and stop trying to impose your own woke version of beauty. it can be a subjective thing  everyone has their ideal vision of beauty.
please tell me it comes in a six foot tall box with the words womb raider writ large on the side
yes  I too believe in our one true Lord and savior.thank you Lord for this bountiful meal we are about to receive.
this is funny! but for a second there I thought there was a new game with a nice looking lara...
please bring back the scripture of the day. God bless you and your family. duane.
I was looking at things on ebay  mostly miniatures. I have a habit  and itslowly dawned on me. I was looking at motu figures  going  why do they need two heads and four hands  my brother   they re not action figures anymore. they re collectibles and display figures only. I had to go to walmart  lo and behold  ulik from marvel   27. too huge for a kid to play with.
them   for only  2800 bucks you too can  have  lara croft! me  pass. call me when its affordable.
I agree the new lara croft in video games doesnt look as good as the classic version. they basically took all her personality away. she looks bland and ordinary. lara was never meant to be a role model for girls  she was meant to be a video game character. as a creator myself I hate the idea that you have to make a character that correctly represents someone else or another group. I create characters based on my criteria  objectives  and the story I want to tell. I hate the idea that when you create a character  it  has to represent  someone. regarding the doll...Imean this isn t a big deal. these dolls have been around for ages. a few companies like  real doll  make these dolls and they are custom-made. you can select from a bunch of faces  hair color  hair type  body type height  eye color  skin color everything. its exactly like creating your avatar in a video game. you can literally recreate any character you want. you can buy the clothes separately its freakish how we came from blowup dolls to this.
wait  the new lara is 4 8 she s a tiny queen I actually dugg her new look too  this just further cements it.but she defo looked better in rise.and now stop reporting on those dolls  I want to see how far this goes. just seen that they also added quiet to the mix  wonder how these celebrities didn t go nuclear yet
Imean  for non-sex purposes  if you wanted a lara statue that had a really game-accurate face for your game room or whatever... you could do much worse.Im sure some of the silicone fashion doll fans have been eyeballing sex dolls thinking   yeah  it costs more  weighs a ton  and takes up more room  but... I wouldn t have to hunt around for tiny clothing  the materials would always be to scale  and the doll and I could share a wardrobe. pros and cons  I guess. youre not going to fit one on the shelf of your curio cabinet like its a super dollfie  thats for sure.
the character model from the first reboot game was 1000  better than the side by side picture which Im assuming is from shadow of the tomb raider  haven t played that one yet . she looks like a trans man woman however youre supposed to say it. looks terrible  even the hair looks like a bad wig. I dont understand the devs on this change. you make a very successful first game and then decide to change the main character model to make her less attractive
mel do they make a life size silicon doll of you
I actually went and saw the images of this doll  and ironically  for all the talk that lara croft has  unrealistic proportions   Im not buying it  given that at least with the doll  it reminded me of a woman from eastern europe.as itstands  Im also not buying the height to weight proportion  5  5  at 93 lbs  I would expect a woman who is at that height to be  what  115  120 lbs  and thats not counting the fact that ammunition and weapons for lara croft is at least another 15-20 lbs  plus the 5-10 lbs. of harnesses and holsters.just saying  they went real light on the weight aspect of this lara croft doll.
a kidney shot in the childhood for fans of the character smh.
correlation does not mean causation. rule 24 didn t exist when the original tomb raider came out. there s simply more porn of everything nowadays. your narrative of devs purposefully making women uglier is a bit weird considering older models didn t have the level of detail to replicate realistic human faces and bodies. they literally looked like dolls and were often modeled by men. if they had to  pad angelina jolie s breast for the movies  and it was still not as big as the games  Im not sure what you are aiming for.
im gonna need a link to this product......for science
Ive officially lost all faith in humanity. this is insane to me that this even exists
I looked for the gofundme link but it wasn t there. did it get funded that fast already
and just in time for Christmas!!!
I ll have to look into this...for research purposes.
they make them with some wieght reduction. its internal. there is a foam  core and the outer is silicone with a steel pipe frame. still so 94 pounds on a 5 5  doll is considered heavy. you have to consider its all dead weight when lifting it and it jiggles a lot. just picture lifting 90 pounds of jello.
meh Ive seen worse
I just found God because of how hilarious this is. haha!
I subscribe to you only for these news. peace.
you know what s weird they cant give you sexy characters in games but they have no problem selling sexy versions of the character in merch. for example this and tifa they cant give use classic tifa in game and they keep changing her every time she s in a game but they can sell toys and art of classic looking tifa no problem.
tbh the reason why lara get more attention now might be because before 2013 nobody remembered who lara was outside hard core fans.the og series was milked dry.the lau series did not sold well.was just not on the radar of normies anymore.about the  shmex  doll.. well is a bitsad but what can you do..also reboot lara is 166cm if I can remember. why they shorten her  who knows.as a men I can say I prefer a shorter  woman but.. xdp.s. also the internet got way more depraved since 2008  underworld petition to start collecting funds for melodie for the doll xd
Im guessing this is the same company who made tifa and aerith
6 52 literal demonetize ban hammer moment right here  see you in court  checkmate
I want to know where s the link for the website  honestly I want to have a look at this Im a little curious. I wonder what else they carry. maybe they have life-size action figures with high levels of articulation of other female characters. these are what are referred to as adult collectible life-size articulated action figures we dont call them the d word.
lara needs some shorts on  I can see what she had for lunch.I liked it when that transitioned lara figure kept popping up
me not really paying attention.  hey that looks pretty good Imay get for my daughter who is just now getting into barbie. oh you were being literal about the.... walks away slowly...
it looks cool  if it wasn t a six doll and more of something that was u can use as a display it would be cool
next lara croft will be a male named lars who identifies as female  but looks like heisenberg from re  village.
that  wetsuit  is more or less the same as the exact classic lara outfit  just missing the shorts.
wait wasn t lara s height supposed to be 5 10
I had no idea sex dolls like this existed... this is will create a whole new era of celibate men once they become more affordable. Imean  3k is still cheaper than a girlfriend haha
ok  guys! why isn t this channel on 100k subs yet ! tell your grandmas and their friends to subscribe! or else...
does it come in ps1 style lara croft  asking for science.
gotta wear goggles if you get close to this things chest  or you ll lose a dang eye omg
im just waiting for the melonie smex doll to drop.
wow if they did one for jessica rabbit
why are they obsessed with turning lara s looks to look like that catness from hunger games  its just not lara anymore.
how long does the sale last  asking for a friend.
okay everyone knows that guys are going to buy that doll and do weird things with it...Imean it looks like it has a nice wrack in the picture is accurate.
grandma s boy  vibes. lara croft doll scene. ha!
lara is gonna end up a hobbit
where can I buy my melonie mac doll
update and doll for the  modern audience . I see
come next year we will see one in the background of mel s room.
I wish they d make a doll like that of me.
not sure why they changed lara s face and body. I went to university with a girl who was basically the blonde version of her.
new lara croft is hydro dynamic.
forgive me girl for Imay sin lol I kinda want to get one now lol . love the vid . !
schwing! starting to get interested again
I did a silly and asked for santa for a girlfriend... then found out this was a reality made posdible.
I already ordered mines
I had a feeling something like this was coming some people are gonna be very hay
lara croft  the ultimate strong and empowered... man
priceless reactions.
have to admit  its well made  its a long way from a blow up doll. Jesus.
I legit thought thatshm3xh was a toy company
I dont know how sex dolls work but I imagine it is created to feel like a real human  carrying a dead weight about and cleaning it and stuff....I hope whoever buys one doesnt have nosy neighbours because it wont look good being seen carrying that object about with its hanging limbs and realistic weight. its a disturbing sight to imagine for anyone not in the know.
surprised it took this long
mom!!! dad!!! melonie said smex doll!
well two things  I chose the right song for watching your video  ie  cypress hill -  insane in the brain as your always going nuts about something and two come off it we know your ordering one  especially with your little worship area back there at 10 59 lol
you know  even though its lara croft  I didn t expect you to talk about this.not that Im complaining  of course.
thats two things you dont want to talk about parents about so awkward and uncomfortable
did not expect sex doll lara croft when I clicked on the video. wasn t disappointed though. mel s giddiness just talking about the doll was worth the watch.
I have to move from my mother s house before I buy that.
start the go fund me and then do a unboxing video lol.
I had to google to see if this is for real ... omfg  it is! ... there is no hope for humanity ...
had to google this after watching... switched to images... yup  its a real thing alright haha
hmm... I think a friend of mine needs this. a friend. a friend.
I get the feeling they took some inspiration from the movies too...
I want the sex doll in the next tomb raider game
okay  Im not kidding now. this video just showed up in my recommendations after I only just finished watching the new smb  mushroom kingdom  official movie clip. a clip thats set for kids on youtube. guess thats their algorithm for you. next thing you know there ll be making a princess peach doll or something. nasty.
she says that yet there is a @ x doll right behind her plus look how excited mel is
dude ...that was freakin  hilarious! lol  the comments section is epic today!
I want one xd
you should buy one and review it
I wasn t excepting to see this when I woke up today
ok I need to see the actual doll.  I cant find it  so where is it please
Im merely one inch taller than this doll and yes I know Im a short dude.
5 5   God that is so perfect .
looks like kate beckinsale as lara croft.
oh she s got a  wet suit  alright
looks like rhona mitra  lara croft.
so melony would yourecommend this or should I wait for blow up rop galadriel
how much  wait what  its not about the money its about making a point and the point is sexyness sells  we all know it  they just deny it on purpuse.chris gore said that all the social documentaries they make dont actually make money but everything with nudity in them does. its clear what people want. we gotta send the message.
atleast they buff her but for wrong purposes
I hate that the s3x doll version is more accurate than the recent official stuff lol
good investment  collectors edition.
wtf I thought it was a toy model
when are we getting the melonie mac shmexe doll3  p
where s your referral link to the doll
if you did do what you said as a joke and get it and put it between the other 2 behind you. man thats gonna be an awkward conversation if your parents get to it first lol
I love the tomb raider games
thing is  people will buy itso they wont have to interact with other humans
honnestly this not a bad business at all if you have the tech and means to create it just go to r34 and you ll have your list on what will sell best
do it. give us a paymoneywubby-style review.
what  no link to the doll
lara croft said Im a bloody wank doll !!!
so what your telling me is that they are going to create famous figures in the video game and public figure space into smeshh objects  lmao  next they are going to create humanoid smeshhh machines with real skin textures. lol
its not the first time... contact dollhouse phill the  cosplay  genre of sex dolls have been around for a while l. croft has been a thing for 20 years. not that I d know. not that I wouldn t want one but they are just too damn expensive. the  robotic  ones are the amount of a car or small house
wait what type of doll is this mel
humanity sure is a weird specimen
where is the petition to model the  new  laura after melonie
poor girl 2700  and they couldn t afford pants for her.
its days like this when I hate being poor.
I found the 2013 reboot character modle fine over all  but they started messaging with her way to much in the end
basically they made lara croft a mom
how is is real wtf! how did they get the actor to agree to this!
she looks ok .but Im fine with the 3 I got
mama suzan is sitting on her laptop looking at this video waiting to hit the demonetize button
I dont think my wife would want me buying one  but if I was a single guy I would buy one and play with it. alot.
well when is yours coming out
hImelonie love your content thoughts on the game director of days gone john garvin saying the game got not great reviews because of woke game journo
they shoud come out with tomb raider 1997 model true to form as how she looked in the game   blocks and all. this will not last no ip holder is like thatsounds good go for it   what we always wanted.
is this official  if yes  wtf  if not  how is it legal
gorgeous. edit  not the doll  although that is very well made in a very gross  purely sexual way.
lets freaking go !!!!!!
lara croft is 26 years old too old for them school teachers.
Ive seen somewhere thatsimulated skin is already a thing.  not sure if it was part of a product  or just a proof if concept...
hImelonie I wanted say I wanted wish u to have greatweekend  keep doing your work takecare melonie
now there really is a womb raider
I was about to say  mf ers ain t gonna support your gofundme for this  because they re gonna need that money to buy a doll for themselves
do they have an option for pixelated lara croft  lol
wait til you see them sell lara croft s bath water.
no way thatshit looks remotely like that in person
I ll have to look this up   study it...for  science .
I love the pause from mel free gel!!! ....
lmao! I cant believe the mad lads actually did it. xd
only  2800      digs through couch cushions for change
Imean its a doll... you can put any outfit on her
sounds like a wise investment
did they get licensing rights from crystal dynamics to make this
I need one
well  I gotta say  they did nailed the good ol  school pointy melons.
theres alot to unpack here
gonna have to sell my dog   my mom   grandma  my computer  etc
I googled the dolls  w h y y y y y
I think is a she  it was a great job too.
let me guess  weapons sold separately  lol
no  cd will probably have their legal team reach out I imagine
inb4 she gets one to pose next to the other lara model in the background.
how did you stumble upon this lol
is this dishwasher or clothing washer safe  asking for a friend
melonie mac my only laura croft doll
4 39no  there are no mistakes......
classic lara is the only lara.
we live in a simulation. a weird ass simulation.
I guess the wetsuit is to make it easy to hose down after  eww lol
they got much better options
Im kind of annoyed they never made a shaggable princess leia figure
angelina jolie lara croft doll ftw
veryyy nice!! cant wait til they make a realistic 9 foot tall lady demitrescu   x doll!!
wait until irobot gets here and there will be lara assassins lurking about
yeah. ses dolls aren t cheap. hahaha!
at 1 14  or is it akward because you immiediately hit buy melonie  I know  your love for laura.  3  3  3
well  sex doll wont take you to court.an image is enough to turn on man. thats why onlyfans and other erotic businesses work. dolls are overkill. if someone buy this  I guess  it would be for a collection. definitely a weird collection  but people collect stuff.
okay...... they have heating options.......  thats enough internet for today.
not even  3000 thats a steal
Im maxxing out some credit lines rn
idk why but icp - I found a body. came to mind after this lol
do you have a link to this
where s all the guys thats going to get this for research purposes lol.
how you gonna make a video on this and not drop the link
holy big honking personalities  batman!
somebody just now decided to make a lara croft s3x doll   not to mention the  free  parts like youre gonna get charged of you want even the basic parts...unless that was just a strategy to stay under the radar for legal reasons
were entering into mgsv quiet territory ..
just wait until you get a henry cavill superman with hydrolics! lmao .... joking
you ordered one didnt you  its ok you cantell us
id prefer a lara croft blow up doll myself  .
ya! buy it
for a different kind of tomb raiding
oh this I did not know. now I ll never get out of my room again lol jk
Im ready to raid that doll s tomb
I see nothing wrong with this.
almost 3k for something that is a less attractive version of camilla luddington  I dont think so but if it was based on the original character model from the 2013 game or cgI trailer  I d totally shm3xh that
aww.  its the reboot version
so... Im assuming you bought one already
lara croft  bedroom raider.
would you call it womb raider
this is so good lol - you may need this start a go fund me I will help so good!

youre so cute  censoring yourself like that.
please buy it
Im getting one

got mine yesterday and its already broken.
who s going to pay   2 800 for this

this doll is going to sell out within minutes.
hmmm...a giant lara croft doll. or a down payment for a new car. hmm...
new lara looks like divorced yoga mom.
not bad
I cant wait to sexually liberate my new tomb raider doll.
do it  buy this
they forgot to put  nsfw  in the title
product name tag titles... or whatever you want to call them... have been really getting out of control for the past few years. I want to blame wish. they really do need to cease with updating lara s look. at this point Im getting some 007 james bond vibes. six     different actors for one portrayal. its getting ridiculous.
crystal dynamics use this as inspiration!
woo wow! talk about attention to detail.
cant wait until u go live on twitch
soooooooo...... when they making a bloodrayne oh...uh.. asking for a friend.
2 03 melonie states  gofundme . I look and realize it isn t in the description. she ends the sentence  and immediately states  not really . I am disappoint.
lol... I tried to go to the website and itseems to be completely overloaded right now.
Im buying
how despicable Im gonna go on there and give them a piece of my walle....mind!
wait  did you just say   cornographic
Im getting two.
why is this a real thing lol
3k   nah I ll stick the old way  of doing it
2 me lara croft alongside jill valentine  claire redfield  chun-lI  cammy  nina williams n ling xiaoyu are the thoughest women of video games
but how many will mel buy
to cool  love your comments. it would look cool in that blank spot behind you.
Imean I collect action figures but sex doll nah Im good. I ll wait for the 6 inch lara version.
bruh. . . .it was only a matter of time. schmex dolls and aI boutta make real women obsolete. lmfao
I would buy a melanie doll
the new lara croft looks like a recently divorced soccer mom who s drowning credit card debt.
doubt they will but we cantry asking lol
@amethystrebellion  hahah!
@w1llki11edsnake07  at least I got the og aod on ps2. my first tr experience as a kid thanks to my cousin! since then I got 2013 and underworld on ps3 and rottr on ps4.
@amethystrebellion  same! I have all those ones also. the ps3 tomb raider hd trilogy had two actual remasters based off the 360 versions. they were higher resolution wise but if you play them at 1080p you get fps dips. so change aniversary and legends resolution to 720p in the ps3 settings for a better fps in them. even ps3 allowed for better fps. the 360 versions of legends and underworld have exclusive dlc that I dont believe ever was included with the ps3 versions sadly. they are backcompat on series x though. so if you want to play those dlcs. you can do it that way.
finally.
mel not even using private incognito browser to view the doll site
first rule of business  find a market with a need  then fill it.
shit I ll take a croft doll over these modern women at this point
o.o...... has she seen the   orginal   laura croft   the orginal was block hap hazard jank cubes!
where can you buy one  asking for a friend.
there s a version that looks like angelina.
me  I dont get it.later me  ooooooh......
lol 166 I d be arrested for possession in can land

so now any dude that had sexual fantasies about lara croft now can fulfill their sexual fantasies lol.

memes made real
I never played tomb raider that being sad knowing how these woke gane companies are trying to uglify women to somehow make everyone depressed . the original lara is the real one her face isnt even the same its still a different person they should have just called her ellie croft  laras sister

why is no one talking about that angry clam
is this a new sponsor
I actually saw this
looks like its time to burn some rubber... wink wink!
why is no one wondering this  cd better come with some serious explanation on this.why is it not allowed for a fan named nicobass to create a tr2 remake and make some money off but a smex doll called lara who looks like she literally got out of the game is
I ll wait for the android version.

I ll have the go fund me in the description goes and looks for link in the descriptionvisible disappointment and audible sigh
we are a doll manufacturer and a doll lover developing high quality gaming love dolls.  I did not need to know about this company or that it was founded by doll lovers.I hope their clients burn in heiI dry clean this shite before use or something... it must be dishwasher safe   one can only lose hope in humanity.
melonie is looking at dirty movies  oh where has the God fearing good girl gone  the internet has corrupted this poor child.
pro tip 0.25 playback speed during the first initial scroll

3 24
time to womb raid
we cant have lara croft making the purple hair they thems feel unsexy. gotta uglify lara to make the woke-bots happy
where you order from  asking for a friend
e cup   no. I want d cup
I remember the  outrage  over tracers victory pose. also remember widowmaker having basically the same pose and nobody gave 2 shits. such fake bs... doesnt hold a candle to thatshmecks doll though! lol!what a world...
dare you to buy it mel
but you gonna buy one tho
boom!!!
yeah she pretty short and also wearing boots
uhh....how much is it again  asking for a friend.
I wouldn t be surprised if the losers who made laura  plain jane  in the new games also have this funtime doll pre-ordered....
population numbers continue to deplete
yooooooooo! lets goooo!!!
2 20 lol
not my lara.
whang! already made a video about this
2.8k.......not my pockets
still a better option than a modern woman
can you plrase buy it and do a reivew for research porpoises thanks
I prefer the real thing but its better than f   ing a robot
your targeted ads will be interesting in the upcoming days. lol
new to channel.
I s this support to be good  I honestly find this strange
way too much for an  action figure .  I ll stick with the  30 banpresto collectibles lol.
stop whispering smex... thats...hot  d
she said istwitter
damn
awkwaaaaarrrrd...
lol. oh no
whereareherorgans  !
oh Lord
I know
minwax   wood...
kinda sad all the fanbase have to talk about right now is a sex doll. Im sorry a life size doll figure.
siuuuuu!!!
can you buy me one of the lara croft love doll
smex doll based
sooooooooooooooo about the link to it................oh  its right there
is she cold
as a man Ive never played with dolls before and even though that lara croft s3x doll looks interesting I have zero interest in playing with that one either. real women are better than fake ones.
here before jay doll hefner
how do I pronounce  shm3xh  I dont speak that kind of slang.
link
are you getting one
lol miss mel  what what that amex on the title    censorship excuse me...   how much
do you have a workout playlist
thought you had to be joking  but nope looked it up.
buy it.
melonie mac is still way hotter than croft or her doll.   3
yeah because back when lara came out she looked terrible in pron remake pictures. now they can make decent images videos  so it makes sence there is more now.
one person  it was one person who got the tracer pose changed.  I was in that thread.  everyone was telling him to stfu and gtfo
you laugh but as women get crazier  us men will find a way. the japanese will lead the way
remember guys  because women have normalized horse  dragon  alien egg shooting d ldos youre not a creep for getting a human love doll.
wtf are you talking about latest tomb raider had the most realistic lara. was freaking amazing.
marry meeeeeeee!!!!!!
mel stopped maturing mentally at 15 lol I cant believe she s thirty six!!!
melonie mac   lara croft
first off why does this exist!  second off is this a licensed product  I found it very hard to believe they would license this
good Lord
buy it.
what the hell is she talking about......  oh.... oh noes.
thats was not the tomb raider news I was expecting
one person complained about tracer one snowflake and blizzard bent the knee.prefer classic lara
boe roonnnggggg !!!!
what ever happened to just using your hand
looks kinda like kate beckinsale
check comments from princes peach video melonie
I kinda have the feeling melonie is a lesbian....also  didn t she have a similar outfit in tomb raider underworld
no pixel t!tes  I feel disappointed.
since when does realistic inherently mean good lol
if it were 500 bucks I would for the lolz  especially if she were classic lara  but not for 2700
its never enough lol.
I wonder if they have a underworld doll  haha!
@w1llki11edsnake07  lol
why is society afraid of attractive women
lol  you shall not scroll!
womb raider
were the go fund me at
ummm... yikes. thankfully  no sane person has  3 000 to blow on an extremely detailed glorified barbie doll. at least I dont have  3 000 to blow on something like that.
too bad its the reboot lara
not like she s one of the most animated figures or anything....thats gross  where can I get one to stay away from it
love you
oh my God its so disgusting where is it
does it fart and queef
really annoying how much game  journalists  bragged about her lack of sexuality.
eww they made her look like one of the motley crue guys!
it must be depressing for woke designers to be forced to make women look at least a bit like women and not men
she looks great...juss sayin. boom acts like shes 15  with her  rents close by...
why are blurring that out   she is actually covered. nothing that yt doesnt let be shown by real women.
so strange they went with the old style laura  for the sex doll  and not the transgender version.almost  like they want guys to buy it.
is she wearing any pants
womb raider
he s all over comments..
I think its more to do with them being a very Christian and very religious family. hearing the word sex is almost taboo among Christians  especially protective parents.
some of those pics were nude  they absolutely needed blurred out
this is sick and disgusting I cant believe someone would buy such a thing. where did you find this  ... you know so I dont accidentally go there and by one one by mistake.
honestly just tired of them making every girl in video games look like dudes with wide jaws and boxy figures.. the average girl doesnt look like that.. I can go to the mall and see girls who make the new laura croft look like a 5
yessss
in for 2
okay  so which one of you weirdos is going to just buy the doll   send it to melanie mac  so she can authenticate how realistic it is. as in not just photoshopped realism..... because umm....review standards...gamergate...something....science  -a weirdo.
no question about it classic laura was way better   way sexier but I think that is what the feminists are trying to get rid of . their needs to be like a indy underground developed tomb raider game because this shit just is not working .
drastically jarring
wow didn t know u made vids
people are weird all im going to say.
phew - just a cosplay doll. not licensed right
funny  seems like my comment was removed. I was wondering why you spell the word  sex  in such a weird way.
dude looks really realistic and hey no feminist bullshit later lol.
e cup when anything less would be uncivilized.
the face looks stiff.
not trying to shame no one but this is kinda weird.

Im sorry but Im going against the grain here. I loved shadow of the tomb raider. my favorite game of the reboot series. my first lara croft game in fact. and okay  I guess I can understand why y all would prefer the original series but saying a series is bad simply because you dont like the design is ridiculous and kind of annoying. like Im looking at the comments and people are saying lara is too emotional. and Im like  being emotional is a bad thing  I dont understand but okay. regardless  the doll look nice. I like it a lot.
this so old
one looks like a guy.
meh I still dont like her.  notmylara
uwat
your beautiful
well .......  no comment.
roflmao !   for rich incels only.
anybody want to give me  2 799
I need 2 talk 2 u its extremely important please trust me we need 2 talk
I like new lara because she is hotter   sometimes men just do not try and go deep philosophy in every fuckin game
how awful. where
thousands of incels around the world are checking their bank accounts at this moment.
this is terrible! objectifying! misogynistic! there is no way I will ever buy...purchase approved... more than one.
so why would you be outraged over that pose   I dont know shit about overwatch but really why would anyone get that upset of that pose itseems so not controversial
for the love of all things holy just make itstop
I heard of lara croft or the tomb raider franchise but I never played any of the games or watch angelina jolie as her but I gotta learn because I love lara croft.
incels dont have sex I was told.
she looked too cute for them  no pretty girls who are confident allowed in games!
