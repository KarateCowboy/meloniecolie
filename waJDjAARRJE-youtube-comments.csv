we just want lara to stay attractive  sexy  bloodthirsty  scantily clad  popular  easy on the eyes  savvy  adventurous  intelligent  super strong  agile   talented
beating the orginal tr games felt like an accomplishment. geting a cutscen felt like reward before youre right back into the action. the puzzle solving could be brutal  and getting past traps took trail and error. you felt good beating a level. like playing through a souls game and finaly beating that hard boss. dont make me watch an interactive movie anymore.
melonie is one of those rare people that makes you a little happier just knowing that they exist
I like the idea of taking from dark souls franchise and go deep isolation  immersion no contact from the outside world. lara took you to places that felt like earth still had magic and mysticism left  but when you factor in all the technology tht the modern games use   it feels like anybody would be able to find ancient tombs  which kind of ruins the whole point of laras unique skills. thats how she got paid  by finding things others couldnt. lara is the smartest woman in the world  with enough courage and confidence to find  dominate and take artifacts because she can.
what we are seeing with video games and movies in general is a really good example of the saying  the first generation establishes it  the second generation expands it  and the third generation destroys it.
out of all the reboot games I only liked shadow because I grew up in a rural parts of ecuador and brazil. the animal sounds  like pauraques  howlers etc reminded me of home and when she s in the forest it looks like the forests I went into with my dad. but aside from that its like a shell of the earlier games and I still prefer the classic lara.
thanks to elden ring  the writing could be on the wall for these hollywood-style cinematic experience games. but seriously  that poor roI warranted a cheap sale and unless embracer loves the tr ip so much that they plan to inject serious funding in addition to the sale price  unlikely   they have to change course. I would not want to be a cd employee right now. love the idea of remasters  unreal 5 please . send embracer an open letter about it!
you are an incredible voice of influence! your lifestyle  your base of logic and your choice of entertainment are all so inspirational. I love everything you say! never stop being who you are
I recognized this about myself when I replayed the five ps1 games in a marathon a couple years ago  and its something that I think is sort of key to the success of a new tomb raider series  it needs to be like a from software game. now before I get flayed alive like jonah from the green inferno  I dont mean that literally  as in  copy from software s soulsborne games   what Imean is that- in support of your point- a tomb raider game does not need a 100 million dollar budget. it does not need expensive cutscenes  and it for sure does not need to be  mainstreamed  casualized to find an audience. those original five games found an audience. those games sold extremely well  and the failure of core design was never a failure of capitalism  it was a failure of overexposure. all five of those games released way too fucking fast and if they d been given some room to breathe  the audience would have still been there. because the audience was there for those five games already. and as far as  well those games back then were too hard - from software hasn t had any issues finding their audience and their games are some of the harder games in modern gaming  so clearly if gamers dont give a fuck about that  why should the new tomb raiders devs  hell  since no one gave a fuck about the original five games difficulty and they played them  and bought the next ones  just fine  why should crystal dynamics care about thatsentiment either
shooting someone in the leg  even when they re standing still  is hard to do.  youre already having to aim downwards  the leg is a lot more narrow than yourealize  and when they re moving you might as well forget about it.  if you ve ever tried to shoot an npc in the leg on fallout or skyrim  it ain t so easy even in a simulation.  the stress and anxiety you feel in the game is small potatoes compared to real life.  center mass unless youre a trained marksman - and very few of us are.  what goes on in the movies isn t how real life works.
I decided to do some math. tomb raider 1996 cost 440 000 pounds which equaled to 543 841.67 usd. inflation it is 996 537.00 usd. fun fact they had a pre tax loss of 2.6 million dollars the year before. the game turned that into a 14.5 million dollars profit.
preach!!! I agree one thing Imiss most of all about classic tomb raider was actually raiding tomb s  wasn t much of that in the reboots. not in the same way anyway.unfortunately some people will never understand what its like when it comes to splitsecond life or death situations you hesitate for a second and thats it. if they was in that position then they would be the ones either dying because the missed trying shoot them in the leg or they died because they did nothing except let it happen.
this is going to sound petty  but I just wanna see laura fight dinosaurs in hd like the next adventure should have a prehistoric story line like the old games
I love the 2013 game personally more than the older ones Ive played. definitely was a really fun experience and I loved the design and was a costume Imade that I was so proud of
I dont think Ive heard yet  but what do you think of the two twin-stick shooter tomb raider games  melonie  those were relatively low budget  although naturally they had a lot more shooting than the original series.
I loved rise of the tomb raider  I really got into that one but I agree with all your gripes about the new ones. I hate the other characters
I just hope that the embracer group can bring tomb raider back to its glory days of good puzzles and killing dinos. really want them to revive the legacy of kain series even more though.  makevampiresandshootingdinosgreatagain
I wonder what tomb raider would be like from a japanese dev  could only imagine the possibilities.
tomb raider should focus on atmosphere and exploration. it also needs to be a bit more  out there  with its content.personally  tomb raider to me has been at its best when dealing with the mysterious elements. I love the true mythologies. I love the dinosaurs and horrific atlantean monsters. there needs to be a bit of horror in tomb raider.lara needs to be alone on her adventure. no support team. no constant voice over. have the cutscenes be meaningful. keep collectible trinkets with voice over to explain what you find  like in the reboot series. maybe voiced lore notes too. and for collecting secrets  add in fun costumes  gold lara  original polygon lara  atlantean doppelganger... all kinds of callbacks and references.
I feel like crystal dynamics is the issue cuz they put bloated budgets into these games with them barely making a profit back and I feel like if they keep this up one of two things will happen 1  embracer group will sell them just like how square enix sold them 2  crystal dynamics will be forced to sell tomb raider itself to someone else if it puts them close to a position of bankruptcy if option 2 happens companies I feel like would do justice to tomb raider if cd sells it are capcom and sega because both companies have a history with the series with 1 4 and 5 being on the sega saturn and dreamcast and with capcom being publishers for the games in japan up until underworld in 2008 and both companies have very stylized games with stuff like monster hunter and street fighter on capcom s side and sonic the hedgehog and bayonetta on sega s side of things.
am I laura croft
@scruffy the janitor  dunno who this laura is mate. I know who lara is though.
most of what you said was just based on her looks. and its not like the new reboot lara was ugly. is it really that big of a deal she is wearing pants
@chandler burse  you miss the entire point and obviously have not played all the games for two decades
@chandler burse  if you  dont care  why are you watching and commenting on a video about it  ..like I said you are ignorant to the source material
@unknown slayer  I dont care anymore.
tomb raider 3 is harder than dark souls lol
@micklucas1  only because of the controls tho let s be honest.
@nosferatu zodd aka based simpai  not at all
sooo truee
games are still good
but super nintendo to ps2  1991 to 2009  had great games.  that was primetime for gaming.  it was the pinnacle of 2d gaming   the birth of 3d gaming.  since then its basically been rehash.
is there any hope for a 4th generation fixing it
I always thought shadow was by far the worst of all the reboot games.
Im trying to play it but the game is basically on rails.its like  put down your controller and watch our billion dollars cut scene while laura looks upset
so you mean itshould keep its  core identity like souls games has to this day  cant argue with that.
there s definitely something to be said about it being able to find a footing being like from software games. even those games make good on thatsense of exploration  discovery  and mystery. in some ways you can imagine just dropping lara into one of those world with her own moveset and it working out just fine. but that means the series has to focus on how to innovate its gameplay  because frankly I dont see any of the previous iterations of tr platforming or combat holding the attention of enough people to keep afloat in current day. souls games can keep people hooked with combat on top of the lore exploration. tr needs to find a way to hook people with challenging and satisfying platforming  exploration and puzzle solving  that doesnt copy all the outdated aspects in previous games. even though many of us played and loved the classic games  we re still the boomers of gaming. when you ask new players to get into old souls  there s a very 50 50 success ratio  and for tr its even less promising. following elden ring s example in building a world could potentially be a good move  but the gameplay mechanics need some careful consideration  cause it wont find success copy-pasting classic gameplay  unless its made with the same budget as the classic games  and makes those same sales.
it is not true that the tomb raider reboot games didn t sell well. tomb raider 2013 sol 14.5 million copies  making it the best selling tomb raider game of all times. yes  it had a huge budget and marketing costs of all in all 95 million dollars  however it was a profitable game. however square enix called it a failure even though it broke even within 3 months and 6.7 million units sold and started to create profits after that - which means the game was also a financial success.rise of the tomb raider had comparable costs of roughly 100 million and sold 11 million units. the game was less profitable than tomb raider 2013  however itstill made a profit.shadow of the tomb raider had slightly higher total costs of roughly 110 million and sold 8.9 million copies  making it the least successfull of the three games. it broke even but not much more than that.the problem is thatsquare enix sets unachievable mgoals for many games and declares all games not meeting these totally exaggerated expectations to be failures.and to showcase their nonsensical comments  square enix declared tomb raider 2013  shadow of the tomb raider and the entirety of the reboot to be failures while at the same time stating that rise of the tomb raider was a financial success even though the game was slightly more expensive than the first one and sold a lot less units. maybe they sold more microtransactions  I dont know. thing is that their statements makes no sense at all - the trilogy as a whole was a solid financial success  and declaring the more successfull game to be a failure and the lesser successfull one to be a success makes no sense at all.square enix expected the games to rake in the same profit margins as their mobile games  which are stuffed to the brim with microtransactions  and ffiv which is a subscription based mmo. thats of course impossible for all single player titles unless they have the same aggregious microtransactions as the mobile games.
@h h  what Im basically saying is that cd doesnt need a movie budget for a game and as for square s mobile games there are only 3 of them that rake in high amounts of money those being final fantasy brave exvius  war of the visions ffbe  and sinoalice and the rest of their mobile games are f2p friendly like dissidia final fantasy operaomnia and the recently released echoes of mana and if you are going to compare the profit every copy of the final fantasy 7 remake makes compared to final fantasy brave exvius in app purchases then its no contest with ffbe winning every time but I dont get why they didn t force these expectations on single player ff games unlike how they did with tomb raider.
I remember when tr1 came out... my friend and I had a friendly competition to see who solved the puzzles and levels 1st.  what a thrill on what at the time was cutting edge in game play. newer versions of tr you could never do the same with.  so Im with you   you very smart lady. bring back the game play that made it iconic.  sorry my rant. but I know you get it.
keep up the good work  praying for you mel  fight the good fight
I recently got the tr bundle on steam  I posted about it on your discord  for classic lara. I already had the reboots free on epic and now I have them on steam too. true fans will do stuff like that until they cant. I did the same with star wars until the disney trilogy.
I d love remasters of the original tomb raider games  the legend anniversary underworld trilogy was my introduction to this world  and I had a lot of fun playing them.  of the next 3 games I preferred the 2013 game  the pacing was best imo and overall a fun experience.  shadow - I adored the tombs and crypts  but hated trinity  hated the lost city  and thought that the size of the game hurt the experience.I agree with you melonie  not everything has to be a big  cinematic experience.  with the uncharted series Ive played games 1  2 and 3 probably 10 times each over the years  but whenever I try to play uncharted 4  dont hate me  this is very subjective!  I ll make it maybe 60  through then find myself losing interest in the game as it progresses.  you can lose the magic when you try to make everything bigger  slicker  and even more  spectacular  than in the previous game in the series.  I wonder if the original tomb raider games will be available to play on the new ps plus streaming service   they sound like the  dark souls  of the tomb raider series!
off-topic  but ... I started getting more serious about the carnivore diet back in january of this year. Im at about 95  carnivore  a can of mixed veggies or a tennis-ball-sized potato diced into a gallon of meat soup  for instance . in january  I weighed in at the doc at about 255 lbs. february  I was down to 245. today  Im at 222  and thats with only the dietary change. and I feel great! keep preaching the word  in season and and out of season! God bless!
if you want to make an amazing tomb raider lara croft game then hire melonie as head of gaming development.
I wasn t into tomb raider  but I loved prince of persia sands of time.
I recently started playing the 2018     spider-man game and Im really enjoying it. Imean  the beginning had a lot of cutscene action  but I didn t mind it too much because fisk handed me my ass a few times  since I never really played playstation before and didn t have the muscle memory to react. I learned it  though  and now its pleasantly challenging and seems to have a good balance of cutscenes  in which spidey wears the suit you put him in--love that  and gameplay. of course  Im not very far in yet.it would be funny if you had to tell spidey to land properly  though. or like if you got knocked off a building you had to recover or fall on your face.   thats just me  though. I chuckled every time altair fell in water.
shadow of the tomb raider on the hardest difficulty setting was my favourite out of the reboot trilogy.
this probably stands as enough justification to take it back to the old school. I know the fans would love it including you  melonie.
they may not have sold well but I enjoyed playing them. at least the first reboot on the island. I haven t played the newest one. its sitting on my shelf waiting lol
I have a theory that cd   or eidos preferred to be sold to embracer   that 300 million was probably all they could afford for them.
can we have classic lara comeback
the reason for aiming for center mass is that people aren t accurate and targets can move. by aiming for the center of the torso you are reducing the likelihood that you will miss completely. police tend to carry low caliber non-piercing rounds. these are more likely to be stoped by the body of the target. in aiming for the legs you increase the likelihood of missing  each shot has to go somewhere so you are more likely to hitsomething that wasn t the target. also your leg has major veins and arteries that if pierced could cause you to bleed out within minutes. also  you are more likely to get hit in the groin if the person is aiming for the legs. a shot aim for center mass but hits the lungs would instead  if aimed for the center thigh  miss just hit the outside of the hip or hit the hip socket groin area. if thatshot misses you just hitsomething behind the target  which could be an innocent person. aiming for center mass is the safest shot anyone can make. telling someone to aim for another body part is basically just peak  tell me you know nothing about guns without telling me you know nothing about guns.
calling the modern versions more of an interactive movie is spot on mel thats exactly what they are after the poor sales in recent games id say its inevitable well see the real lara return somedaylets make sure of it
the reboot tomb raider was actaly the first game I ever payed start to finish on consol  since most of my childhood gaming experience was on pc and wiI  I played the hell out of tomb raider aniversery back in those days.  it actually took me a while to realize there was a storyline out side of the mansion which is funny to look back on  I appreciated the way lara constantly survived by the skin of her teeth and was excited to watch her grow into the confident  cool  sexy character Imet in my wiI days. but then it just... never happened.
I loved the in-between era. anniversary  underworld  etc.
I actually loved the 1st of the new tomb raider games. later games I felt that the following sequels  they played itsafe plus added unnecessary cut scenes.
in regards to auto grab  allow people turn it on or off in the settings menu  which I wouldn t think would be too difficult to do.
even when you had to get hundreds to thousands of dollars to make a indie game  it can sell well too. it has to be better creative  unique gameplay to have the games reasonable.
thats fantastic! congratulations! I was wondering  how much do you spend on meat a week  im trying to budget and start a carnivore diet
@fandom overthinker  per week  its about  30 for meat  80 20 ground beef  chuck roasts  whole chickens  half- or whole pork loin . I go through 18 eggs in about 2 weeks  and as far as dairy  milk and cheese   probably  10 a week.
@komanga  they already did. someone made a remake of tomb raider 2.
as a fan and worker   it would be really nice.

@w1llki11edsnake07  true
play the complete editions of rise of the tomb raider and shadow of the tomb raider for the best experience with them. they added quite a bit of dlc to them which makes them better games.
@w1llki11edsnake07  I ll have to do that
@maverick smith  yeah! shadow of the tomb raider got a bunch of dlc added where you explore different tombs and solve puzzles. plus a bunch of costumes.
100  this
well that and have you ever fired a hand gun  there is more kick back to it then a rifle.
aim for the body  torso area ... its the right thing to do for better or worse.
shadow of the tomb raider is pretty good now on ps5 with all the dlc included. there is quite a bit of dlc for that game. the good kind.
@w1llki11edsnake07  I tried to enjoy it  but the game pace feels really slow
@beez kneez  thats a shame. its actually the closest to being like a classic tomb raider game as you actually raid tombs.
they could still make a 100m game that is still beautiful to look at while still being challenging. they should just hire you for a consulting role.
am I the only one who actually loves the overdramatic cutscenes and the story with lara s dad  like I genuinely enjoyed the realism in the reboot series  tr2013 is defo my favorite  and this is coming from a long time hardcore fan  but I do agree that tr needs better gameplay  more tombs and most of the mechanics of the first tomb raider games but I would still like to see the same amount of cutscenes like in the reboot series
its the production creep.  gotta make everything pretty  sound good  long  etc etc  eventually the budget will exceed what you ll get out of it.  its like throwing thousands into a crap car and expecting a massive return.
Ive only been subscribed to your channel for almost 2 months. but you are by far my favorite channel. its been an absolute blast hearing your opinions and watching you  share your faith. regardless whether or not people argee with your opinions you share them with respect. so God bless you for stewarding your platform so well. looking forward to following and  supporting you in the future.
after the way the year 2020 was Im scared to say hindsight is 2020.
I just checked my steam. I bought all the tomb raiders  even the topdown ones that have just have lara s name. I checked how much I played the newer ones. I barely touched them. I think I was never interested and just bought them on a sale.
I agree totally on making the games less cinematic and more like games. they blow so much money on that. you dont see movies trying to be games. less tutorial time too  games in general  not tr . let the player figure a lot out for themselves. its part of the fun.
keep on making awesome content
I feel like the first game found some good success because it probably revitalized the franchise. but as the sequels came out the games only dipped in sales  because the series was starting to lose its edge.
I recall them cutting the price of the 3rd game to half price mere weeks out the gate.
thanks for a lot of that backfill for the newer tomb raider games and the situations surrounding them. I learned a lot and was somewhat curious to find out some of the details.
ahh good point on tomb raider being a british property originally! I forgot about that.
so many western devs seem to be just chasing the last big thing  instead of innovating or simply iterating what their customers liked within a franchise. sometimes it feels like there are only really 3-4 games out there  reskinned 50 times.
can we have a game where melonie raids the ruins of crystal dynamics to dig up a rumoured good tomb raider i.p.
I liked the first and shadow. didn t play rise enough. I liked the lara just didnt blow me away or anything though.
2 20 I know that I bought these games for 5-10 dollars a piece with all of their dlc included. itseems to have sold decently well in those steams sales but that is a problem unto itself where profit is concerned.
I wish melonie wouldn t hold back so much and just tell us what she really feels  p
I grew up tomb raider.  love the series
been doing to lara croft  just absolutely disrespectful to her as an original character and to the fan base  absolutely shameful.thanks mel for making these videos and speaking the truth! they are trying to make lara look androgynous. could you make a video one day about the character jonah  I utterly despite how they made him a  prominent figure to lara  like he is some kind of saviour to lara a big brother  it appealed to the male fantasy of saving lara when she is in danger it weakens her as a power fantasy figure.
we can get the aaa quality tr game for a fraction of the price if developed on unreal 5. but I absolutely agree  cutscenes should be limited to a minimum and should be as a reward. also  and hear me out  custom trl level costumes.
ur not the only one. Im with you.

well they are trying to capture thatskyrim feel game.  Imean they could put out skyrim verison 20 the super ultra mega edition with the super ultra mod mode and it would sell. the only game that came close to that in replay is the witcher 3. what they need to do is just do there own thing. thats why guild wars 2  elder scrolls online  final fantasy 14  and ruinsacpe are doing so well they did not try to be world of warcraft.  they all just did there own thing now ff14 is top dog.
I would buy that.
I never even played a tomb raider game  but this applies to so many other games.  it is really sad how stupid these game makers have become.
melonie  I cant tell you how many times that you are so right about God is in control. as long as you have faith  he s got you. that has been proven to me time and time again  no matter how bad you think things are.
I totally loved tr legends its in my top 10 games of all time
3 05  a pity  because legend was as good as a fresh air for that claustrophobic era. and anniversary I guess was the best remake I ever saw. Im yet to play underworld.5 06  lara croft series is simple and addictive enough to bury the old ones for good - I guess they even create it for people like you. but it lacks more expressive story and characters. thats what the main line stands for  I think. I guess tr never was in a so correct path before.7 12  you crazy fool little girl... 8 12  well  looking at those number  maybe you are right. a pity.10 00  its possible to has platform challenge at a fast pace. on the old games  this was made by a bad playability  compared to legend trilogy . bad camera position  too much car maneuvering  often accidents due to details  and the list goes... I would still buy and play an old game like that nowadays  but Im glad all of that was gone in favour of better mechanics.	about the  game playing itself   I remember that  in the mansion of anniversary  certain trophies    I took a while to get  either due to realise how to get there and to perform the jumps. other moments  on egypt I guess  there were a time to perform some action. that game was amazing!
razorfist is right videogame going over budget is the reason why games are not doing well
the whole shoot the legs is the dumbest argument anyone can make. ask any marksman they would tell you they re trained to shoot at the largest target and that the body mostly center mass bcuz its the easiest target to hit and on top of that you get shoot in the leg and get hit in any artery its over. you have a higher chance of survival getting hit in the body.
who knew that turning a puzzle platformer series into a generic ubisoft title with cinematic movie game malarkey would underperform. that and the obsession with muh gritty reboot cliches and correcting the character for activists.
half the time I skip cutscenes even in a game I love. so idk why they think they need to make it like a movie . thats why I love but hate final fantasy because the cutscenes are soooo long and sometimes their unskipable  but two things I do think cd got right was the time trials and all the outfits you could have .
the  super thanks  is around the thumbs up down button. kinda like a superchat in streams  except its for normal videos.
hope jeff ross and team can make a good tomb raider game. he seems qualified for it after making uncharted golden abyss. I hope they have changed course on the talk of lara looking more masculine for this new game. that would be a terrible idea. especially since they are now owned by a new company. wouldn t want to f! it up with your first new game under them right off the bat by making decisions like that. let s all wish for this to be faithful to a lara croft game and who she is supposed to be as a character. dual pistols included.
would be good if the remake the original games the exact way it was in that game but just upgraded with the graphics
I liked all 3 rebooted games. I thought they were decent  but I understand the flaws
its cool if people didn t like the reboot  but I loved it. I thought it was a great story that turns lara croft from a young girl into the tomb raider.
make some of that casg girl!!! nothing comes free in this world. you truly rock and keep going better and faster
Im playing through rise right now and then will do shadow  bothbof which I got  free  via ps  so I know exactly what youre saying
awww!!! you gave me a shout-out !   d  d thank you so much  melonie mac! that made my evening  dGod bless you! and thanks for your Bible verse of the day segments!
personally Im just tired of all the hyper realism in almost all games. I d rather play a anime 2d game with a barely decent plot than a hyper realistic 3d game with an excellent plot just because I like the fantasy of games. if I wanted to play something that looks like a movie I could just watch a few hours of a similar movie and save time.
it always felt like they were too focused on making a movie and not a game with the new tr games. thats actually something I dislike about a lot of the new games in todays world.
I laughed at my roommates playing current God of war. it was showing everywhere to grab and jump to. I yelled  loser . hahaha!
tomb raider should have been making a cultural boom the same way the new batman movie has. a must buy  must participate event!
well its an rpg. rpgs have a story.
rpgs... you should expect loads and loads of dialogue... while in action adventures  horror included  not so much. unfortunately  the latter has been getting the hyper realism and cinematic treatment which can be quite divisive for real dedicated gamers. unfortunately  many casual gamers now just get crazy for  cutting edge  graphics. I still find many games between 2005-2015 still very good graphics wise  while many today just love to ridicule ps2  ps3  and even ps4 era graphics  smh .
same. and if I want to experience hyper realism I just open the front door. triple a gaming industry really isn t seeing the forest for the trees.
I love the realistic model of lara. I just want her to be badass again and I only played the game. and only play games for the story. therefore I dont see the issues.
surprised that you haven t mentioned the stealth in the reboots. thats the only thing I like about the reboot trilogy.
you hit the nail on the head in this video mel  true tr fans know their franchise better than anyone. I also cant comprehend the walking simulator and cinematics either Im so glad you addressed that. its just not an adventure with lara croft anymore.
sounds like they are consciously or unconsciously trying to change the title from action adventure to an rpg with no rpg elements  haven t played itso no idea if those elements are there .
if Im a cop  Im aiming for the midsection  least amount of movement - biggest target.
noice! Im happy they didn t sell well. I didn t think they did so this confirms it for me. I only ever bought the first one got all the achievements then forgot about it. the experience was meh. it was forgettable honestly. never was even interested in the sequels. didn t look good  didn t look fun  didn t look interesting. all commercials I remember were just cutscenes with lara as always looking like a scared pathetic clown in distress and thats not lara croft. I remember for the one I bought the devs saying lara would start scared and evolve to the confident lara we all knew but I never saw any of that and lara looked exactly the same as the one I bought all the way to the last game. the sequels didn t look like sequels to me but more like dlc for the first game because she never evolved at all. lame bod too compared to the real lara so I just literally had nothing drawing me to it. also the one I bought was so easy compared to the real lara croft games that I was underwhelmed overall thinking this was a rip off game. felt more like they wanted to tell some dumb story in movie form but they knew itsucked so they couldn t make an original cgImovie so they tied it to lara croft and her brand just to force it. sorry  thats not lara croft. thats generic no name default female character in a lame overdramatic story which she only survived the events in order for the story to be fully told. it killed my interest in the ip because know now with this sjw nonsense being pushed by force a real lara croft game will never again be made and with the younger generations being dumb  lack common sense  have the attention span of a goldfish I really dont think they will ever make a lara croft game with actual lara croft tier puzzles.
what your saying is make tomb raider make tomb raider again. well  io interactive had that experience with square enix with hitman absolution when square wanted a  new  direction for the franchise. io got dropped by square because of poor sales of hm absolution. what io did was they got or bought the ip  published the new hitman trilogy and did awesome and brought back good ol agent 47 and modernized. so  if this is done to the tr franchise by the new owners  then your wish is granted.
tomb raider legend was my fave
lol.  Im watching this and thinking  lara from the game  dark hair  looks like tattoes on left arm  dark green sleeveless shirt  being commented on by someone looking and dressing exactly the same.  priceless.  only thing missing is a bow.
so how do you do this whole carnivore diet  Im trying it myself but I find that Im eating huge portions for each meal  what used to be one or two cheese burgers is now 6 to 8 patties  I cant afford to be eating like that  any tips would be appreciated
5 11 this is where most people lose me. its not the budget  is how you use it. a high profile aaa tomb raider game with fancy cutscenes etc is possible  always been  they just needed to create better and more focused games around it  empty collectathon hubs  unimmaginative gameplay loop and wannabe bloggers held those games back  not the budget.
when are we going to get a lora croft cosplay from you
toby gard who return and make tr legend also anniversary.. but hey dont get me wrong I love legend and anniversary I really enjoy it playing back in the day and of course I love classic tr from 90 s the most. plus we never ask them to reboot tr series they make lara into different character also her weapon using bow..really   l
im trying to play the third one in the latest series it keeps taking away the controls and putting it on rails with billion dollar awful cut scenes..and the woe is me look on crofts stupid face I got it for free and still hate trying to play it or should I say interact  with it .
you do have  apoint about the dramatic cutscenes that crystal put but tomb raider legend story was awesome remember how lara lost her mom due to mirror the whole idea was amazing tomb riader legend was directed by toby gard so its not crystal own invention!.
as someone from the netherlands I have my doubts about that aim for the legs claim. I believe the dutch police are trained to shoot in a way thats less likely to be lethal  but legs  nah
tomb raider isnt about character development  its about beating puzzles.  lara croft is simply the vehicle the player uses to move around the world.  basically game devs need to focus more on the world  not lara crofts life  relationships or backstory.
I enjoyed the first 2 but didn t enjoy the 3rd one at all
I didn t mind any off them they were a little ridiculous in parts but most games are to some extent I think sometimes people expect to much.
who the hell is saying that lara is more successful than ever   I love her super much  dont get me wrong  but she was an actual sex icon back in the 90 s in magazines  commercials and everything. nowadays  she s just discount nathan drake.
they did sell well  they are the best 3 in sales among all tr games  the problem is square enix not knowing how to use money.
@goro majima  nope... they still under performed ... each reboot game as another poster said cost  100 million... as in  300 million revenue against  300 million production budget... thats just bad  bad  baaaadddd.  -
@mr. sinjin-smyth  I blame square enix for that maybe if they actually listened to pratchett instead of forcing daddy issues on lara and cutting interesting scenes. they did still sell well  they didn t sell well for their budget. Im not really 100  sure that a remake of the old ones would sell amazingly as fanatic old fan love to blabber about. Im glad square enix sold tomb raider not gonna lie  there are many aspects of the reboot I dont enjoy but God y all love shitting on it for every little thing and rise old tr like a masterpiece.
the another point is that the japanese side allowed all the time in the world to be horrible while the american side of the company was rushed to be mediocre.
the first re-boot game was so fun. played it many times  and will play it again in the future. played the 2nd one once  and never bothered again  and never even finished the 3rd one. so they could have gotten better if they had just progressed the story  instead of just repeating the first one with a worse story and a progressively uglier lara.
classic tomb raider 2 is my favorite game ever.
what they did to tomb raider is a bad. but what they did with the legacy of kain series taking a backdoor seat is a crime.
square enix sold the rights to tomb raider and the studios for  300 million. square enix made  332 billion in revenue in 2021. they doing just fine!
a comment on the comments  donut operator is awesome and has an in depth video on why shooting a suspect in the legs is a bad idea.
21 46 wether youre a leo or not  if you have to shoot on someone armed  there s only one place to aim for.center. mass. repeatedly  until the threat stops. or if youre a master marksman  the zone between the eyes or the nose. boop thatsnout
anniversary is the best
for the survivor trilogy  the only things I liked from them were -the fact that the 2013 one  first game of the trilogy  actually felt like an origin story for a reboot .-the multiple game modes and level replay ability in rise of the tomb raider.-the tomb layout and puzzles in shadow of the tomb raider.also the character design for lara was best in the first game out of the trilogy. it just went downhill after 2013 tomb raider.
because they turned lara croft into a plain  boring blah. they removed the attitude   sexiness   cool factor -- the games were fine  but when your lead character is forgettable  so is your game.things are far worse now -- they would make her into an ugly  unlikable  wretch  if they made the games today. unless tomb raider is taken over by a company with giant balls  itshould be shelved until we are able to kill off the entire  woke  video game industry  and start over. nothing has a chance to succeed with the current ideology that dominates most studios.not only should you be put in charge of tomb raider  mel -- you should be the person they model the character after -- now that game would sell.
legend has sold over 6 million copies.not gang busters numbers  but you have to remember it was a much less expensive game to make and market.I just wish they would make a game that would make core design and mid 2000 s crystal dynamics proud  not a game that is meant to outsell the square enix 2013 reboot.
when it comes to games  Im kinda in the middle. I enjoy story  so I love getting the expansive cutscenes. on the other hand  I also enjoy actually playing the game. Im also not opposed to playing either side either.for example  resident evil is a series that I enjoy most of the games  even with the faults with each game. scenes started being over the top since re2  it was always fun seeing things blow up. I can also enjoy all types of gameplay with the games  because they bring something different. but at the same time  I dont like if the games go too far in any direction  like orc  no story  just banging your head against a wall  or zero  good story  boring gameplay . the remakes are an exception  because they dont take away from also enjoying the originals.I enjoy hearing about your love for the original tomb raider games  especially since I never got to enjoy them. from what you said  I think we need a game like the original re3  make your own adventure. either way  I think it is time for games to have another evolution  I would love to have an adventure again
what is your favourite tomb raider game melonie
honestly  I would love it if they went back to the original style  but at this point I think we have to let it go. the very first tr has a special place in my heart  partly due to where I was in life at the time  but it would be nearly impossible to recapture that feeling. best we can hope for is a new ip with a similar vibe.
I dont think tomb raider will ever be the same again... we will never see the old lara croft again... its a shame...
its not really thatsimple. they had to re-invest their tech a lot. which is why the cost got a little nuts. just making tomb raider kind of hurt them. which is why they are switching to unreal 5. tech debt was too much. additionally square shot its self in the foot with an exclusivity agreement for a year on rise of the tomb raider. had they just bit hte bullet  they would have seen a huge return. as a result fans were soured on the survivor trilogy. I think the legend trilogy just needed more love. you are correct about core. those  stupid over dramatic cutscenes  are part of the reason the survivor trilogy did better than legend. they also do not make up for a vast chunk of that 100m  youre going on about.  dont let tomb raider be aaa anymore  they did that twice. those games didnt  do well either.  stick to the old formula  those games didn t do well.so let s also talk about the studios themselves. california studios cost too much to run. they need to move their talent out of thatstate. the taxes dont get you the property costs  and employee pay will break you. the sales of tomb raider were crippled by square. putting the games on sale too soon hurt them. trying to recover from rise s blundered exclusivity deal  they quickly dropped the price  the soured playstation gamers waited out the cost. hell I didn t buy the ce until it was severly under cut on pc for that reason as I wanted it on playstation. I did get a ps4 version  but long after it went on sale. shadow of the tomb raider just had no presence in the community thanks to the rise blunder  and everyone knew just wait 3 months and square would cut the price down to 10 bucks. doesnt matter how many copies you sell if youre giving the game away for free.I agree that lara is an antI hero  I d like to see them return to that type of story. the expectation was the survivor trilogy would flow into that  but it didn t. I d like to see a return to legend story telling and level design. I dont need open worlds or open zones. that is where your tech debt started to come in. trying to create all these complex systems didn t help them.
videogames are going overbudget
this woman is so beautiful. congrats for the channel and great content...
dang 100 million dollars I could buy food for all of peeps in my town
lara croft should be closer to super mario thant kratos from the lattest game.  straightforward  and  timeless ps  thank you melonie I felt I was the only one who thaught this    the i.p. needs to come back in european flare.
yeah not sure why they changed her look from the first reboot game
I think your comment is shadow banned. I saw it in notifications but not here in the comments section
let me ask  dollars or yen
why didn t more people buy tomb raider  underworld
@backup368  because it was objectively shit. tomb raider legends was good. underworld simply wasn t.
@marvlous lie  what about anniversary
@mr. sinjin-smyth  anniversary was just okay. there wasn t anything  good  about it  there wasn t anything really  bad  about it. it was a meh kind of remake.
@marvlous lie  not including the ones I didn t play  my least favorite assassin s creed game was the first one. imagine if people didn t buy it though.
@backup368  the legend-anniversary-underworld trilogy was the weakest of the games. they did not sell well as the gameplay was pretty outdated by the time they came out compared to other games at the time.
the modern trilogy sold better than any of the other tr games before them. shadow has sold like 17 million copies alone.
there were forces that were constantly talking about lara being revealed as into women.  that would have completely killed the franchise.  nothing short of somebody else buying it and reinventing her  would have saved it from that.  its not about hate  or a phobia  or any garbage that would have been slung around like the dung it is...its simple...most of us aren t lgbtq  so we have no interest in it  and we are tired of that crowd trying to take over everything.  its about interests and preferences  thats all.   its like with mass effect.  I could have been interested in samantha traynor  but the moment she revealed herself to be only into women  I lost complete interest in her.  she simply became the person that told me I had messages  or somebody needed to see me. one of the things I did like about these last 3 tomb raiders  is that lara was still quite pretty.  hot actually.  any guy who says they wouldn t be thrilled that if a real life version of her...exactly like her...same face  same hair  same body  same voice...if a real life version of her started flirting with him...if he isn t thrilled  he s not into women.and while they never revealed her as straight  there s no real indication she s not.  she s completely asexual  so you can fill in the blanks for your preference.  so while not as interesting as if she s a mass effect character you can romance  its better than them destroying the possibility by making her a lez.
@leroy russell  damn so are you unable to play games that dont feature the same race and gender as you as well too
@underthegun897  not at all the same thing.  I do play the tomb raider games  so that answers the gender thing.but  when I play mass effect  I did do two play throughs with femshep.  one paragon  and one renegade.  I tried to do the romances  but it just wasn t the same.  I tried to romance kaidan  and jacob  but sorry  Im not into guys  so there is no feeling...no emotion in it.  it felt weird.  so on the second play through  I tried to romance liara  but that felt off also  because she s me favorite lI for broshep.  and Im not a lesbian.  so I stopped with the romance options  and kept it professional.  and still  it never felt the same as playing broshep.  people dont call me ma am in real life  and I dont flirt with guys.so the more rpg elements in the game  yeah  the less I will play it as a female.as to race...I know you think you have a point there...but think real long and hard about that.  let me clue you in.  at one time  most game characters you played were white and male.  we were told this was wrong  because other people needed to see themselves represented in the game.  people needed to be able to play as a character like themselves.  if you were a black guy  its important to be able to play shepard as w black guy.  if you are an asian girl  you need to be able to play as an asian girl.   this was vitally important and the industry had to change to allow this...so it did.well  the same goes for other things  such as sexuality.  I dont want to deny an lgbtq person the ability to select an option to be that in the game.  but the majority of us are not  and we dont want to be forced to play as an lgbtq person...so the default needs to be the majority  and the options should allow altering that for those who are not part of the majority.  this is how you allow for inclusivity.  by not being exclusive to the majority  and their wants  and desires.the only time you should force a race and gender is if its vital to the story...especially if its historical.  if you are going to play a game as a german soldier in wwiI who is also an agent trying to undermine hitler  it wouldn t make sense for you to play as an asian woman.   and games like thatshouldn t be focusing on sex.  red dead redemption 2  and tomb raider do this well because there is no focus on sex.even so  red dead redemption could have allowed  as an option  for a character like mrs adler  to be the main character you played as.  Im sure many girls would have preferred playing the game as her  or a character like her.
Ive been replaying the legend franchise and I cantell you with certainty it hasn t aged well. killing enemies is unsatisfying   dirivitive. the puzzles are boring and lifeless. the platforming is tedius. the story is sooooooooo lifeless along with alistair and zip constantly talking. its literally a chore. anniversary took the best things about the original tomb raider and added their melodrama about laras father which adds nothing to the overall theme and takes laras agency away
@underthegun897  just to correct this because their are dev videos out there. only 30 people were working on tomb raider anniversary it didn t need to make an insane number  the sales of anniversary were completely fine and they did end up making a profit. they explicitly stated in a dev video that anniversary didn t cost much to make. the profit on it was decent enough.the reboot trilogy you need to keep in mind each game has a budget of over 100 million dollars each. those games need to make an insane amount of sales before they can start making a profit. melonie was correct their barley barley breaking even. 300 million dollars and the reboots have only sold 38 million. these aren t great numbers
@ladylaracroft96  its still the highest selling games in the franchise
@underthegun897  so  they still under performed ... each reboot game as previous poster said cost  100 million... as in  300 million revenue against  300 million production budget... thats just bad  bad  baaaadddd.  -
@mr. sinjin-smyth  so you call them underperforming despite selling better than any of the previous games in the franchise lol.
@underthegun897  square said it  cd said it  the financial numbers say so  and what more of old school fans. sold more means nothing if it barely profited more than it cost to make. the original core-made games cost much less to make and profited much more by comparison.  -
@mr. sinjin-smyth  yeah cuz games used to be made by a team of five or six people in the 90s. anyone comparing game budgets and profits between now and 25 years ago is ignorant to the industry.
@underthegun897  even tomb raider anniversary had a small amount of people. only 30 people worked on that game compared to how many people worked on 2013  their only 6 years apart which isn t anything insane.
@underthegun897  also the most profitable tomb raider game in the franchise is tr1 from 1996 sooo...and also the best reviewed tomb raider game is tr1 from 1996....
@underthegun897  are you strictly a fan of the reboot era because you keep trying to degrade classic and legend games for some reason and its really weird.
@ladylaracroft96  because games in the 90s were made by a time like six people and a budget of maybe  1 million if they were lucky. of course games back then were more profitable.
@underthegun897  who says you cant make games under 100 million dollars anymore  its a choice  you know. I am completely sure that if you take a small group of skilled and passionate people who care about tomb raider and give them a million dollars  they will produce a game ten times better and more profitable than the bland and woke hollywood shit that the series has become.
@seikkailia22  tr 1996 was considered aaa for its time. to make a modern aaa title you need about 100-200 developers and a budget of millions of dollars.
@underthegun897  there are now numerous people telling you your information isn t adding up. please stop
@ladylaracroft96      yourealize a game today made with 6 people on a  1 million budget would be a small indie title
@underthegun897   just to put things in perspective resident evil 2 had a 1 million dollar budget with re1 being speculated to have the same budget   60 people working on the game vs tr1 s 6 people and 542 thousand dollar budget..resident evil was considered aaa tomb raider games costs way less to make and had an insanley high profit  tomb raider 1 being the most profitable in the series  today a triple a games typically costs 100 million dollars each while before the reboots tomb raider never really had the standard triple a budget
@underthegun897  sooo that would make them much more profitable then the reboots because they cost was massively lower while the reboots costs 300 million so square enix as they have stated lost money from the series with the reboot
@underthegun897  that is also why square enix had to ultimately sell tomb raider because although they ported the reboots to everything known to mankind it wasn t making them a profit
@underthegun897  also resident evil 1 made 2million units while tomb raider had half of their budget and made more then them with 7-8 million  their is never a definitive number of 7 or 8 for tr1 s sales for some odd reason edit  looked further into the numbers and holy shit resident evil 1 only made 2 million lmfao.
I believe are around that time they were still trying to get money back from cough ff14 1.0 and the major issues with ff13 series.
change lara s personality and have a storyline that actually has to do with raiding tombs. thats all I really wish they d change. I thought the survivor trilogy was great personally. Im not sure why people are acting like they were walking simulators. they re just not. easy does not equal walking simulator.
... remaster the first three games. why not the first four games
when I read the wikI article for one of the reboot games thatsaid the writers wanted to explore the consequences of a rich white woman taking artifacts ...that was when they lost me.  1 classic lara wouldn t give a fk hell I dont give a fk. colonialism turned my country into the poster child of 3rd world poverty if I wanted to know about those consequences I d read a text book not play a game.
if you shoot for the legs you better have an unchoked shotgun with a good spread
I personally enjoy the newest tomb raider trilogy.
I remember when crystal dynamics roasted naughty dog for copying the tomb raider formula  only to copy it verbatim for the reboot. not a bad game by any means but a far cry from the original games.
I enjoyed the first two of the new ones. I got bored with the third and stopped.
Im late to this  but tomb raider s first reboot game sold 14 million games. shadow of the tomb raider sold like 11 million games. even at  20 each  they would make  300 million per game each they sold the franchise because they didn t want to be bothered with western properties. the time investment may be the real problem. if you take 5 years to put out a game  and 2 years to get your money back  everyone wont be down for that.
shoot the leg   probably.  the dude got hit with 14 shots.  one probably got a leg.
I got all 3 from ps plus   played the first two.  they were meh  not even interested in finishing the trilogy up. never played the legend trilogy  but I got it for cheap on ebay  kinda want to play them
legend beat aod in sales  but anniversary sold less than aod and I think underworld barely beat aod in sales. to be fair to the lau era  they had potential of being really good games  if they had been given a couple of years ontop of the time they had to make each game in that trilogy.
I wouldn t mind raiding your tomb luv. oooooh!!! thank you Im here all night.
I think the reboot era missed a lot of recognizable features of lara and tr it was more a mix of different popular games at that time and it didn t had this authentic tr feel.lara didn t looked like lara  and lets not forget lara and tr already had undergone many major changes. so this  I know who this is   I know this game  moments werent there  only the names were the same.therefore I think a lot of people did not really connect this trilogy  or era if you like  with the franchise  tr  and how people know tr as it is  because it already lost a lot of its authenticity. so the only advantage it had to stand out from other popular games at that time was the name. dont get me wrong  I liked the three games  but I think they took to many recognizable features of the game and lara.
I liked the reboots and wish they sold more
I agree 100  that tomb raider needs to be in british hands again. I love a good storyline in a game  but I d be happier if the said game wasn t just an interactive movie. gameplay should be the priority over graphics  not that graphics dont help a bit  but I was playing the 2013 reboot  and holy crap  I was annoyed by the cutscenes. I also want the lara that I grew up with back. I enjoyed aod personally  but that was the last game in the series that I actually enjoyed. I would love it if they remastered the first three games with just some slight control tweaks  maybe improve the graphics a bit   not go overboard with realism
I love most of crystal dynamics games and think they could do a good job of restoring these games.
the first tomb raider reboot was on sale on steam for like 3  and I bought it.Imade it 10 minutes before I was so bored I quit and uninstalled.it doesnt let me play the game!  just quicktime events and cutscenes
my go to for anything tomb raider. I ll go to her before the actual game developers because she knows whats up when it comes to lara croft. keep up the awesome work girl!!
I agree!
we played the first and never followed up with the two following tomb raiders. always heard underwhelming reviews.
she always explored these tombs to find artifacts and put what she found in a museum for people to see our past. so I have no idea where the people who say these sorta things got those ideas from.
they already did a good job with the tomb raider games back in the ps3 360 days. so they can do it. because they did it before.
you literally played 10 minutes
2013                                                                                                                                                                                                                  .
I dont like the 2013 reboot but I love realism and the drama
I absolutely agree not cut scenes bulls it!!!! classic gameplay... lower budget... back to what made the games great.... lonely mysterious tomb raiding maybe
the reboot tomb raider games felt like a clunky gender swap uncharted game. the original games felt more like zelda without the open world part  it was full of puzzles and platforms.
I enjoyed the reboot. rise was ok  shadow I really didn t like. laras character got worse as the games progressed.
the first tomb raider reboot is a classic. second was good and third was decent.  I think that is why the sales were disappointing. the games were less good as the series went on. third was mediocre story and linear with no originality. hopefully the powerful story and character development in the first reboot carries into the new  coming games. if the new games are as good the first  or even second  the future should go well for lara.
for almost a decade the fans begged for dual pistol combat and they never gave it to us. Im glad they didn t make money. hopefully new games listen to actual fans
I like the reboots.
I didn t like what they did with her character but I really enjoyed the first game in this series. the others were very meh though.
gamers  these days aren t gamers. no patience   no skill and they cant think for themselves.  get mad at me you want but you know its true
this is the exact reason streaming on twitch and other platforms has become so popular and honestly overwatched. because when they make these games with woke hollywood ideology and all these cut scenes and ridiculously over the top suspense and action  then its more interesting just to watch it than it is actually to play it when you consider how much it cost to buy these games nowadays.
what are the best gfuel flavors
lots of old games have had new life on the switch.
I dont know why any tomb raider is concerned with shootouts. am I the only one that would love a tomb raider with gameplay revolving around just discovering  platforming  treasure hunting and thats it  some animal attacks fit  but there s no need for all the repititious human killing. not with tr.
the issue with the games  butt   they using millions and millions on publicity ads
we just want good gameplay  awesome characters  sensational storylines   sex appeal not getting preached  lectured or feeling bad
I didn t see a problem with the  hollywood  presentation. 100 million seems high but for tomb raider its reasonable. when you have ff15  ff7r and kh3 and give them a combined 31  years in development with even bigger teams of developers  then thats not reasonable.
enough of...err...plugging  plugging my stuff.giggles
so much logic  so much common sense! behold our new gaming overLord. let s all rise up to unseat the corporate rats to put our Lord and savior queen boomer!
go boom!!!
alot of people dont like her look in the reboot games which I understand  but I have a feeling it could get much worse with today s attitudes... like I imagine us wanting this look to come back because of how much worse it could get. hopefully it wont tho and we ll get a more classic look.
thats what turned me off with the reboot trilogy.
unfortunately  many casual gamers now also just get crazy for  cutting edge  graphics. I still find many games between 2005-2015 still very good graphics wise  while many today just love to ridicule ps2  ps3  and even ps4 era graphics  smh .
its not that high... yeah for games it is  but you have to keep in mind that 1. more and more people are flooding into the gaming industry to search escapism as hollywood is burning itself to the ground  going broke on going woke... like they lose 200 mil  no one even gives a bleep  till the studio has to be  saved from bankruptcy  by the californian plastic so fantastic community  silicon valley .
it was already bad enough. sure they could make it worse  they could turn her into abby from tlou2  which they were basically in the process of doing  she got more and more hench with every game   but the damage had already been done.speaking for myself here  but I am one of the reasons the last two last tr games  rise shadow  underperformed. I refused to buy them on release. I didn t buy them till much much later when I could scoop the both of them up in a steam sale for... I think I paid 5 bucks for the pair  and I only bought them because they were that dirt cheap.why woulden t I buy them on release  because I took one look at what they had done to lara and went  nope! .I ll bet you my bottom dollar that I am not the only one who did that  and that it did play a key role in these games under performing. also  to this day  the 2013 game is the only one I d even considder replaying  because its the only one of these games where lara looks even remotely female  she doesen t look like lara croft  but atleast female .
coming soon - tomb raider   the trans adventures of larry croftstarring lia thomas as the voice   body model of larry
idk  I gotta disagree. the reboot games are awesome. perhaps they didn t spend enough on marketing. I also hate that making a profit isn t enough these days. it has to be a massive hit or else
get ready for trans raider! wooo  dont never not kill me Im kidding
two problems with the tr reboots 1. too easy compared to the original series.2. they changed lara from busty to bleh.you dont mess with what works. from software proved that people still want the so called  get gud  games from the past. the ones complaining about difficulty are those that never want to get good  particularly  game urinalists .changing the character s look just to appease some sensibilities is also a no-no. the people complaining about looks do not play your games . a vocal minority is not your consumer base. pander to your paying costumers  not to those that will declare a victory and move on to pester someone else. smh.
in new zealand police dont have guns at all except for lock boxes in the car.
these games are made for the likes of grace randolph to watch as a movie  and a terrible one at that
the original tomb raider is so good that I bought it and never played it. I let a friend borrow it who loved itso he kept playing and at some point I just let him have it because he liked itso much. to this day  ive never played it but want to.
in shadow when you had to talk to them villagers and do their chores . yeauuuhh ubisoft tier garbage I didn t know they spent so much on those cutscenes that I skipped . welp
the best definition of an  assault weapon  I ever heard was from a shrieking man-harpie with blue hair who screamed in kaitlin bennett s face   its a weapon thats designed to do nothing else but kill!   thank goodness Ive only ever owned the kind of guns that are designed to bring me my coffee in the morning.   its very hard to watch  but there s a video of a female police officer tasing a large man. he walks right through the tase and stabs her about 4 times with a big kitchen knife before the other officers can shoot him. my brother was a soldier for 20 years and taught urban ops. anyone who says cops or soldiers should  aim to maim  had better be able to blast every single round-17 red duck in  duck hunt  on the wing while the duck divebombs at them with an icepick.
facts
I really love the reboot especially rise of the tomb raider. hopefully the next lara croft is abit more humorous like nathan drake and the game is super cinematic and violent
I totally agree with every word you said. Ive been waiting for a real tr game for over 20 years. many will beat me up for what Im going to say  but I think the only studio that could bring it back to its original feel right now is from software  with more focus on puzzles and platforming than combat and an easier difficulty mode compared to usual from titles . am I the only one who perceives that kind of classic tr feel  atmosphere and tension in games like sekiro and elden ring  and then they seem to be one of the last studios able to make proper games rather than cutscene-stuffed auto-piloted interactive movies.
once again talking about tomb raider I see
I have to say I enjoyed rise. however. I agree with what you are saying. one of the things elden ring taught us more so is dont shove story constantly in your face. old tomb raider charm I love. controls not so much but that was a product of its time and hardware. bring back our saucy sexy bad ass lara
I think they turned the comments off on the velma trailer I know this is about tomb  raider I just want to say this Im getting sick and tired of them screwing with our favorite tv  s shows and video game characters Imean if they really want to save us then they can save us from themselves by not messing with our tv shows and video game characters this woke crap is getting ridiculous
crap like this is why I focus on indie games. they care about making games fun... a radical thought in these times
I didn t mind the first game but I just got bored of rise. felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
6 40 yes. games nowadays is kinda boring to me. maybe because of the realism they want... mocap. I dont like that. bland movement. Im an animator by profession and I can say that the developers should use mocap sparingly. they are not really bringing games to life by mimicking the normal movement of life specially in tomb raider. you just study the movement and make your own version of it. its like know the rules before you break them.
the bad return on investment in 2021  was because of the marvel games tanking. it wasn t tr s fault. the reboot trilogy has sold towards 40 million. that almost equals uncharted in its entirety! and all the  critics  keep going on about how well dude raider sells. er  news flash critics... half of uncharted s sales were bundled  and dont count.  no  it was that avengers crap  that forced the sale from square enix.I think tomb raider escaping from square  is a good thing  quite frankly. maybe now  they ll lower the budget  lower the expectations  and we ll get some classic tr goodness back. but tomb raider is stronger now  since she s been in the 90 s.
well they took away laura s fan service. that did them no favors. as we all know they did it to push a political agenda.
they announced on their livestream that the total lifetime sales for the tr franchise is 88 million  with 38 million of the sales being for the modern reboot trilogy. thats nearly 43  of all total sales. how did the games not sell well again
except shadow of tomb raider  that game was boring asf and had so much filler bs  freaking child segments  give me a break lol
@nico gaiden  they were pretty mediorcre  the best out of the 3 was the first
@cloud strife  it was done during the time when open world adventure gaming was at its peak. in hindsight  it offers nothing too original in terms of gameplay..... sort of a combo of uncharted plus assassin s creed.
I agree except for the third one.
@nico gaiden  seconding thatstatement. I loved the first two entries  but had to force myself to finish shadow. the gameplay was perfected  but ultimately  the lack of a cohesive story arc between all three made ended up hurting the third entry. still reply tr2013 and rise from time to time.
@rob  to tell you the truth  the third game was a letdown. I  at the very least  expected more of the same but the story around trinity was subpar and not enough action.
2013                                                    .
@zoloft77  they didn t really build up trinity enough.
crystal saved tomb raider legend was amazing but eidos interactive were to greedy and sold themselves to square. square is notorious in ruining famous games.
@kochI daisuke  legend wasn t great at all for me as I was in love with the classic formula by core design. I never liked the gameplay of that  trilogy   I prefer the last one to that. the only good thing there was that lara was still the same lara  just with improved graphics. I wish I could say  the same about the current lara  who I dislike completely.
@tony romano  legend story was amazing. the last one are you joking shadow  this mediocre stupid boring game with shallow empty world its a walking simulator!.
@tony romano  stop yelling about classic tomb raider. its time is gone its boring and  aps1 game!. it had a puzzle but nothing else just soul less game with a robot semigirl!.
@kochI daisuke  all the things you point at as negative in the classic tr are their strength points for me. its just a matter of what you want from a game. I dont care about the story and the character s depth when I play a game  Im 36 and belong to a generation where games where meant to be played  not to tell stories. anyway when I said  the last one  Imeant the last trilogy entirely  not just shadow. I preferred the 2013 one  but its still nothing compared to 1997 tomb raider iI according to what I personally look for in a game.
I have no idea  I think is the nostalgia
@goro majima  it was a rhetorical question. the reboot trilogy sold the best out of the entire franchise based on the sales numbers I provided. this video makes no sense
tomb raider  1996  is  and likely always will be  my favorite tomb raider. I think a faithful remaster like the crash bandicoot trilogy would be fantastic.
core design were let go because they couldn t deliver a next gen game. hence why they made trae on psp. it has nothing to do with who sold how many. cd proved time and time that they can well made polished games.
I had more fun playing barotrauma for over 200h than I had playing shadow of the tomb raider. Im still playing barotrauma. they really need to stop pushing photorealistic 8k ray tracing bullshit and focus on fun in a game that you play for fun.
you look like lara in this video 11 00your hair the tank top and tats all fit
Im not surprised the trilogy underperformed... I remember teasers with woke lara made me avoid those games. later I purchased them for peanuts. graphicaly those games are great  unfortunately woke lara is so annoying.
I dont know if you ve played deus ex  but 300 mill is an insult to deus ex too.there s also one thing they would need to change for tomb raider remasters which is the walking controls. walking should not be split across the stick and d-pad and also have button modifiers that let you run.
well duh se! tomb raider went the woke way... got broke!
hmmmmm  there needs to be a balance between story and gameplay. I took months to finish the souls series precisely because there was no story to glue me in. tr reboot felt super hollywood cause it was trying to be the next uncharted but tbf  the story in the 1st reboot game was good  it was the sequels that really sucked balls. tr going more indie will hurt it more imo.
let s goooo
I think the kingdom hearts series has the same problem as the tomb raider series. I feel the same way about cutscenes being a reward for actually playing the game. kingdom hearts 1 is my favorite video game  and itsparingly used cutscenes. the second and third games of the series went off the rails with cutscenes and it just wasn t enjoyable. I took a break from the third game for a few months cause the cutscenes were annoying  then I came back to it  had one boss battle  and then a twenty minute cutscene. I stopped playing it again and haven t played itsince
unpopular opinion here  Im sure  but I prefer the rebooted tr games to the originals. Ive nothing against the original games  and enjoyed them back in the day  but after the first three       traversing a level just became a chore  running around in circles over the same ground time and time again. I know this will almost certainly be a minority opinion here  but I have no desire to replay those old games  real life is frustrating enough  without having a game make me want to bash my head against a brick wall!  in contrast  the story-driven narratives of the reboots keep me coming back  so that I can experience them all over again.I guess the problem is that the new games just aren t in the same genre as the classic tr games. the originals were mostly puzzle-driven platformers  while the reboots are character-driven adventures. in retrospect  they might have been better to use a new character  rather than lara  and call the series something other than tomb raider. that way the games could stand or fall on their own merits  and not anger fans of the originals.
actually I got them all for free thanks to epic
its funny. I found your channel because we completely disagree on tomb raider. I never had any interest in the series before the newer ones  and if they remastered the old games I probably wouldn t buy them. but despite this disagreement  I thoroughly enjoy your videos  and have since subscribed.its almost like people can have different opinions without trying to ruin each other...
I agree remaster the original...and I think a remaster of the original assassin creed would be cool also
does she realize thay the reboot series actually sold incredibly well sold many more copies than the original series
300 mil is way way too much for tomb raider. its a niche game. Ive only met less than a handful of people in my lifetime who played it like you
cool!
the old tr games where difficult but fair! they totally should take a lot of inspiration from fromsoft and dark souls. tired of realism  bland characters and all this progressive shitso if things doesnt change I wont buy the next tr.
exactly!! I dont know what the hell all these people are saying that the reboot games selling well. the only one that did decent was the 2013 game  from what Ive seen .
wish we d get the old games for new gen consoles
sounds like you dont like rpgs.
rise of the tomb raider sold 11.8 million copies  this was despite being exclusive to the xbox one for year.shadow of the tomb raider sold 8.9 million copies.are the statistics lying  because these are far better numbers than kingdom hearts or dragon quest put out and yet they re the ones that continue to get sequels.
if I remember right  the first of the tomb raider was a failure at 7 million sales  at the time I think itsold something along 14-20 million by now   and demon souls was a runaway success at 1 million. no one asked for the game to look the way it does  and lets be 100  real  the primary expense of a game today is art assets a visual masterpiece is nice to see  bt give me psychonauts or a hat in time any day of the week over something that looks  real  and 3 years down the line looks like crap because real doesnt age nearly as well as style.
what if tomb raider was rebooted into something like a mixture of mass effect and dark souls with the challenge of souls and the story character control of mass effect  or at least what m.e. should have had instead of what we got .  give it a customizable character with backstory and personality choices on top of the typical race  gender  build options that are typically in other character rpgs  with lara croft s look personality being the default options.  wouldn t that be awesome  especially if they had some rpg elements like customization to the various weapons you get that alter or enhance the characteristics of the weapons you get throughout the game  or am I the wrong kind of nerd for the tr fandom
Im also concerned
honestly  the new game cant come soon enough. Im so tired of hearing about the reboot trilogy. did it fail succed  I dont care  we ve been told that we re past that  there s no point in tossing more salt on rebooters  wound.
good.
would also be better is squenix haddent blown a butt load of money on two sequels for a crappy ff game
one of the few times I disagree with your opinion. Imean youre right gameplay always first. but making the games look better is always a plus. if it doesnt reach a certain fidelity as a aaa title then people would complain or not support it at all.  one of the best aspects of the series is that it goes to locales that are mostly untouched by modern civilization  mountains  jungles  deserts  etcetera. that is why graphics are important  nature  and old man made structures are really a marvel to see  at least for me .  the realism also adds to the connecting to the character as we see how injuries could effect us in the same position.
most the money made from the tomb raider games came from the reboots. it cost a estimated  110- 135 million for shadow of the tomb raider  alone. the reboots sold 38 million units worldwide  with all 3 games. at  50 a pop  how is that   did not sell well ! !   1 900 000 000 is pretty good if you ask me!!!! stop it  melonie.
there is no casual excitement for a new tr game. those days are long gone and thanks to the franchise being milked to death by eidos in the 90 s it will never ever climb out of that hole no matter what they do with it. by the time angel of darkness came out  irreparable damage had been done to the franchise and its hobbled on ever since.the reason they dont seem keen to make a new tomb raider game is because it will be met with an average reception at best and they know it. you ll see  the day they announce the next game it will be like the dmc5 announcment trailer at the xbox show only worse and I feel like thats the only thing that will snap old school tr fans out of their delusion that they are still living in 1998 where lara croft is still a megastar.
and who got the hands on tomb raider in hollywood  paramount. they made the first two movies. I think youre on to something what destroyed core design in the first place. eidos interactive corp is also guilty for this because they were the publisher who wanted to cash on movies. they acquired core design and later on took away tomb raider from them and sold them off to rebellion in 2006 who then closed them down in 2010.just to think why eidos was filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and square enix acquired them in 2009. their balloon budgets was what killed eidos.
crystal did  a great job and they brought lot of profits. its square fault they asked crystal to handle shadow of the tomb raider to eidos montreal that tiny incapable studio while they asked crystal to work on  another genre that they got no experience with its square fault. square suffers from a bad management.
the focus was gameplay  to many it wasn t. many consumers could have been drawn in from the movies and prefer to have thatsame experience when looking to buy any of the modern games. the box office was one metric that tomb raider superbly outdrew final fantasy in. I dont see why youre upset at square for giving large budgets for tomb raider games when they spend far greater on cinematic experiences for their cookie cutter boy with spiky hair rpgs  and there are zero signs they re going to stop either
how does a game have a 100 million dollar budget   thats just bonkers
tomb raider was the dark souls of platform games back then  and still are. everyone played it  only true fans mastered it  the tank control were a challenge to master but a massive satisfactory succes once you got the hang of if. every hinch calculated  every jump designed for you to feel amazing controlling lara. the peak of gameplay was tomb raider  the last revelation. sadly  when crystal  revived  the saga  was like what could a soul game became if ubisoft do it  they destroyed the core experience  no pun intended  in order to bring more casual players for the sake of  saving  after aod failure  wich was an unfinished game not for core desing but for eidos s fault. so  tomb raider is actually a niche game in terms of gameplay. general public loved lara croft  a bunch of people loved her and the game dificulty. they went with lara over the true esscence of what the game was actually loved for.so  the best thing that could happen is simply rethink what tomb raider was famous actually for  how lara was a freaking superstar without even talking that much in the game except thatshe talk through actions instead. so  I do think treboot trilogy games are fun games  but they are not the ideal. lau  I cant even touch them.trle community and nicobass  in a way  I dont like the lau thinguie  understand the saga the most.
that was the problem. it doesnt feel like tomb raider anymore. it feels like they tried to be uncharted and failed.
tomb raider 1 is still the best game in the entire franchise.the atmosphere was unrivaled by any of the sequels - reboots included.it almost felt like a horror game at times.the franchise should go back to being atmosphere and gameplay oriented and the action should be dialed back by - a lot!tomb raider 2 felt too much like an action game and the levels were too complex.tomb raider 3 tried  and failed  to strike a balance between 1 and 2.tomb raider 4 eventually learned its lesson - but by that time it was too late.tomb raider 5 was a glorified map-pack.angel of darkness must not  be talked about.the reboot was nice - but failed to understand what made tomb raider great in the first place - but it had its highlights here and there.the 2013 reboot was a good game - but it would ven percieved as even better if it wasn t called tomb raider.rise had too much downtime  due to the open world-meme.shadow was just a bad game.
I ll still take legend anniversary underworld trilogy over  rise of the pale shadow of the tomb raider  trilogy any day.
um you do know jrpgs are all about story and cut scenes right  where is western rpgs are less so though they have them its more d d. so to say japan makes better games. that really depends on what game it is.
I take issue with this video  making itseem the missed targets of eidos montreal  crystal and io interractive  io is here because they are a western dev that had the dreaded   target   issue  due to either quality or spending to much when in reality  squares quality has fallen in their own eastern devs in the last decade and they have always had a history of overspending.regarding targets  square puts so much money because there targets were unrealistic to begin with due to their poor management. they will dish out billions on poor ideas for an mmo and then more trying to reboot it  fund a spinoff that is using an expensive engine that cant do what they want  throw that away  reboot the game as a mainline game  develop a new engine and continue to have dev problems due to numerous dev hell shit for even more years and release with fucked mechanics and a story with more holes than a swiss dairy product. so no  the studios not meeting targets isn t their problem  its square not knowing what to do with money being the problem. and do I need to mention the exclusivity deals with microsoft or epic games which will either stop people from buying their games or put people off overall regarding the games quality  I cant speak for tomb raider  but considering deus ex was lumped in here towards the end  as well as a talk about western devs  I ll say its safe to talk about the other games  deus ex human revolution  manind devided and hitman 2016 has more quality than most of the shit they put out in the last decade. ff13 and all its parts  dogshit  ff14  nearly killed square till it was rebooted by the only head with sense there yoshI p  ff15  dog shit mechanics with a combat system that plays its self and a plot without a story until you get the dlc and even then its not a good story.babylon s fall...why the fuck they thought it was a good idea to put their name on that garbage  kingdom hearts 3  considered by a large portion of its fans as a disappointment  maybe not out right bad  but lacking in comparison to previous ps2 and psp games! the only great content they put out is the reboot of ff14  nier replicant and automata and ff7 remake part ....and thats it....since 2009 those 4 games is all they put out thats considered pretty good......meanwhile deus ex hr md rebirthed the immersive sim with 2 outstanding games and io interractive produced one of the best stealth titles out in years...but yet square assigns these studios to dev not just cape shit but a games as a service capeshit because they think a mixture of games as a service and nfts are the future  fucking whoops on that with the recent news  should I also bring up the many franchises square sat on and did nothing with  the last thing they had devs to do with legacy of kain was some multiplayer game that didn t even release.....no  its not the studios problem  its a dumb fuck publisher problem.
british or european hands would be as bad as hollywood or canadian.
9 07 right  its absurd  they could have spent far less  made something that looked good for ps2 era  gave it draw distance and gg  a good game sells good regardless of looks  you may lose some sales  but you slash the cost of art
they destroyed ff7. I know a lot of people like the remake but damn Ive not been that disappointed in a long time. I get sad thinking about it. I waited so long for that game  they went and turned it into an action game instead of a traditional rpg and I despise whoever made that decision.
@lucky strikez  and most fans have forgotten they ve been developing that game before the ps3 came out.
motion capture with actors  voice acting  story   script writers  sound effects  visual effects  200-300 people working on it  etc... thats aaa budget games for you.
is itsafe to assume  from as much as you complain about cutscenes  that you hate pretty much any game made by telltale
tomb raider legend was the best but it came after the aod which destroyed the reputation of tomb raider. ppl didnt rated legend high cuz they were used to classic tomb raider. but if we bring legend to todays standard it would surpass the trilogy. its not crystal fault its core fault they ruined the game in aod and they were complaining about their managements. players were impressed by classic tomb raider cuz at that time when the first tomb raider came out they were impressed with  a  protagonist girl thatshe is awesome and a hero. but over time ppl got bored crystal saved the franchise  you should compare legend to aod not to tr1 or tr2.
maybe they invested million of dollars  but the games did not felt like a million dollars games  gameplay wise it felt like very lazy and soulless. tomb raider need to be developed  by an independent studio that focus on very few ip s that now what they are doing in my opinion and that way maybe tr wont be triple a game anymore.
I do not like tomb raider 2013 very much. I do not like some of the npcs. that island  how many people had to die on it for there to be rivers of blood to wade through. the deaths are horrible and I could never enjoy them with my daughters. rise  more of mostly same and the final battle was terrible. shadow  I love the pretty graphics but it isn t very fun. I will say that the part where you face the jaguar was pretty cool. I paid twenty dollars or less for the first two and maybe thirty for shadow.
hey I liked 2013
these cd games were so bad that even lara croft herself didn t want to be in them. and they made tombs optional...in a game called tomb raider. nuff said.
special thanks cost money mel . no thx.
we need remake of the classic tomb raider games
people complain about the controls because they are stupid.
legacy of kain series remake pleaseleave tomb raider for a while
well  looks like Im 1st. so its my turn to say something for once   post some comments
it means that the tomb raider franshise is dead because even the movies bombed. the new generation doesnt care about tomb raider  uncharted took its place.
the reboot is literally the best selling tomb raider games of all-time  Jesus Christ do some fucking research.
Im so sick and tired of the game industry trying to be like hollywood resulting in most triple a games being either uncharted clones  reboot tomb raider  or witcher clones  all ubisoft open world games and horizon zero dawn . please start being creative again and start taking notes from re8 and elden ring.edit  also listen to it takes two.
it is no surprise that the reboot trilogy sell bad. they were bad
youre so salty
the term  walking simulator  is used way too freely. these games are not walking simulators.
hey melonie I just want to tell you and say that the company who made tomb raider games and other games like tomb raider games that did have enough money to keep making tomb raider video games and other video games and their profit was not doing so well and so good that they could not go to far to make any more tomb raider video games and other video games like that  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that the company didn t have any money left to make any more tomb raider video games and other video games to keep their money and their profit going and moving  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that I am truly sad too that they are not going to be making anymore tomb raider video games and other video games now and in future. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
itserves them right  they ruined the character and the gameplay was mediocre - like a cheap uncharted knock-off.
I thought horizon was pretty darn creative. hearing the audio logs of peoples last moments hit hard.
