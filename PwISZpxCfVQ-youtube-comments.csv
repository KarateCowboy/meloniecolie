when galadriel decided to give up being an elf and become a british archaeologist who ventures into tombs and ruins I couldn t believe how brave she was. some of tolkien s greatest writings.
melonie   Ive been dunking on rings of power for months reality  everyone who isn t paid promotions by amazon has been dunking on rings of power for months
when elrond said he  identifies as being an orc  I got so emotional
my favourite part was when galadriel stole the tank and used it to force through the walls of ninja-pirate s stronghold to get to the medallion of a thousand souls. tolkien was a visionary.
when gandalf was teleported down from asgard  my jaw dropped  and the scene where galdadriel grabs halbrand and says  Im the king of the world!  gave me chills. mind blowing stuff.
I got chills when galadriel is asked  what is best in life    and he replies  crush your enemies  see them driven before you  and hear the lamentations of their women.  the very essence of this character summed up in a such a powerful scene.
as much as I love hearing you rant melonie  you dont need to torture yourself with any more she-hulk  lol. especially if your gonna watch rings of power.Im gonna avoid watching either  I get so much more fun out of watching you  nerdrotic and drinker dunking on these shows that I would get from actually watching them myself  anyway.
agree with you on your takes here. I dont like what I am hearing about the show itsounds like a disgrace to tolkien s work. well done!
when galadriel used the rings to summon captain planet I was truly moved! so stunning  so brave that the first thing Im going to do on the 2nd is cancel my prime membership.
it began with the forging of the great films. threads were given by tolkien  immortal  wisest and fairest of all beings. rights were granted to jackson  great miner and craftsman of the mountain of lore. and nine  nine hours were gifted to the race of men  who above all else  desire quality. but they were all of them deceived  for another show was made. in the land of amazon  in the fires of mount prime  the dark Lord bezos forged in secret a master flop. and into this show he poured his money  his greed and his will to dominate all film. one show to ruin them all..
dont give money to companies that hate you. glad youre reviewing these!
when galadriel pulled out that mini-machine gun and mowed down the whole army of terminators  I was like  yas slay queen!
this is why everyone needs to start reacting to the lore videos and music that brought the songs and poems to life like omariorpg did and a few others.     I suggest starting with elronds epic tale   thumbnail shows a baddass artwork of elrond saying  its a sad story . you ll be amazed. tolkiens prose are so amazing. so soul warming. tolkien untangled in this video and as always too uses such beautiful prose!
galadriel s use of the five point palm exploding heart technique to defeat sauron was truly great writing.
good video melonie. I wouldn t mind a review of she hulk  but I dont want you to suffer any more. these reviews are interesting. I feel like they are taking to many liberties with the rings of power. this show just sounds so bad. you made spot on points melonie. I like your necklace. go boom family
the biggest problem with critics these days is that they re paid by the people asking them to do the reviews  so they ve lost their teeth  they dont smell blood in the water  and they certainly dont go in for the kill.in the past  30-40 years ago  a critic worked for a newspaper or tv studio and they knew their job  they critiqued things and got paid for that. they happily pointed out all of the flaws. siskel and ebert immediately come to mind. love them or hate them  agree or disagree with them  they were always more than happy to shit all over a film that didn t respect the source material or changed things just to change things without adding value to the movie. it always surprised me when they d spend 5 minutes crapping all over something and then saying   you know  its not bad  I did kind of enjoy it.  at least going in  I was always aware of the  liberties taken  and generally made the whole experience a little better because I wasn t disappointed as much as I could have been.these days  if youre a critic  your paycheck is tied to being sent review copies  and if youre not giving positive reviews  you dont get sent review copies. so the whole point of being critical of a work has been lost  they re nothing more than sack less yes men. media outlets need to grow a pair of balls and hire a critic that actually isn t afraid to critique things and pay them to review things release day if review copies stop showing up in the mail. people  even if they completely disagreed with the review  respected the reviewer for their honest opinion  not this shill crap we have today. I cant name a single reviewer I d go to today. I know not one person  even if I hated every word that came out of their mouth  that I could look at their review and tell myself that my only complaint of that review is that we clearly like very different kinds of movies. go back to the days where they happily shit all over someone s work so the rest of us could make up our minds if the flaws were acceptable or not  and we could actually enjoy the movie a little bit or we looked at the flaws and said  nope  I ll wait for it to be on broadcast tv. at least the commercial breaks will provide entertainment and bathroom breaks.  go back to the days where we hated reviewers because they were honest  and that brutal honesty offended us  not like today where we hate them because they re completely full of shit  and being lied to offends us more.
curious to hear what you think about house of the dragon. the mc s are complex and likeable especially the antagonist. Im gonna watch ep.3 tomorrow
it was a dark  dark day when jeff ordered Lord of the rings on wish...
galadriel in the second age is very different from the third age. they was very close to lore let remind that is litteraly thousand of years between the two ages. we dont see eldron swinging his sword in tlotr but was a warrior in the second age.
I actually have been enjoying the series. and I have always loved the whole Lord of the rings series and the hobbit movies and books
stunning and brave!
lol
and now the access media is dunking on it a little.
as a sjw I hope it turns out great
and pointing out their mistakes by giving examples how to correct them!for example swap celebrian  galadriel s daughter for their galadriel.make arondir a half elf of hadar parentage.make princess disa a desert dwarf part of a dwarven community who couldn t live underground explaining their skin colour!but the most important point...no one rewrites tolkien especially that pair of bad reboot half wits who dont know harfoots are hobbits!
trans orcs are orcs
I want to see that movie
then she got the melodies in her head to make the gun.
hell no! you must endure whatever torture disney has devised to review the twerking she hulk episode lol
you d love george the giant slayer and brian j s nerd talk  sunspen  lex morningstar  knights watch  tolkien untangled did a great video recently along with voice of geekdom! and so many more!
you win the internet.
@tala kÂ  Ive seen another version of this but its still very good.
this might me the funniest comment Ive heard all year. somebody needs to turn this into a meme
critics are obsolete in this day and age.in the past they served two functions  give an opinion by professionals in the field and give potential viewers something to go on from.nowadays many of those  professional reviewers  have trouble putting two words together in a coherent manner  not to mention everything being filled to the brims with politics  rather than judgment on actual merits not to mention most of those  critics  are more interested in kissing company ass  to keep access  than giving anything even resembling objective opinion . and we also have situation when anyone can share their thought and opinions of any piece of media in existence  allowing for far more accurate averaged score.whole calling this shit  Lord of the rings  shows how little showrunners care about this franchise. lotr refers to specific events that took place in 3rd age.they are going for spectacle  expecting to pull in people on name alone  with very little substance. and the fact that they spent a lot of money on it means nothing. if writing is shit  it matters not how good backgrounds are looking. jacksons lotr was so good because it tried to follow original story as much as possible  while bringing it over to big screen  that would inevitably require changes. writers like tolkien are rare  this idiotic notion thatsome random dipshit can just come in and  improve  upon it  is nonsense and this is exactly what mindset amazon has. it is not what words you use  but how you use them.
I just watched the first episode. the fact that I didn t then immediately hit play on the second is bad enough  but I actually fell asleep 40 minutes in  no joke. amazons  vanity project will be forgotten as soon as it ends.
dont hate watch stuff .truer words never spoken.
dont torture yourself with another episode mel.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that great job with this video. anyway I just want to make a comment about the new tv series ring of power that I definitely think that the ratings has dropped big time and I truly think that the show will be so awful and terrible that no one will be watching this show and if they do come up with another sequel to this show series that the ratings will definitely drop off from the edge of the cliff too and the people will be sorry that they ever started watching ring of power series  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you bout my thoughts on the ring of power tv series and I just want to tell you that you are doing a great and fantastic job with making this type of videos on youtube. anyway keep it up and I am so happy for you. I also want to tell you that your nails look absolutely beautiful and gorgeous and the nail salon people did a fantastic job on your nails. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and hope you have a good night too melonie.
love the cameo at the water scene of tom cruise flying past in a jet fighter this show has it all!
amazon must have different teams producing their shows. they can make shows like reacher thats amazing and fairly faithful to the books. then they make this train wreck and other wrecks like the wheel of time series that greatly deviates from the source material.
as soon as I saw the drinkers review on thor I knew that taika was going to be cut loose for the next one. the mouse doesnt like it when you damage the brand.
anna seems to have sheshe-hulk covered. love your games reviews more.
remember lads  no hate watching.hate watching is like hate f cking an ex.you can pretend you did it for the right reasons in front of your friends. but in reality  youre coping. its a brief respite from crying into your pillow.its a cope.no hate watching.
yes please suffer a 3rd episode of she-hulk for the cause ... would love to see and hear your opinion on the 1st 3 episodes.thank you for your service  captain mac.
I d love to see a video about she hulk  especially as you could use it to talk about exercise.
when galadriel and megan thee stallion started a twerk battle against sauron  I instantly knew this show would be something special.
a series to rule them all   yeah  because it is a very positive thing to compare it to one ring to rule them allone ring to find themone ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind them. in the land of mordor  evil  where the shadows lie.
that ew review was savage
I knew galadriel was a blm supporter since I was a child  Im so glad they show how brave she really is.
I still wanted to watch it and honestly Im happy I did.  honestly I dont see it being all woke like we expected.  I think the media made it look that way  but honestly Ive enjoyed it.  it was fun.  I was laughing out loud with the dwarf s wife telling her husband that elrond was staying for dinner.  it had its fun moments and its serious moments.  it was beautifully done  and while the actors obviously aren t exactly the same as the old actors  I think they ve done a good job portraying their characters.
I have a question and I dont think there is a real answer  but if there is no one will admit it. the questions is  why make a bad show on purpose  Imean who will itserve. if you are after the people that comment on this show or others. whether the love the people or story that they know and is being twisted into something no one wants or they just comment just to comment. I guess the next step is to have a reality show on a comic book or movie ever one loves and put it on tlc. luv ya mel  keep up the good work.
I hate for you to suffer but I would like to hear your opinion on she-hulk. I listened to you on the drinker channel and had to look you up. you make a lot of good points. I definitely enjoy what you got to say.
well done.
thats why I stopped coming back to games I hate. sure   giving x you hate a chance  but what s the point of wasting time on something you know its going to be bad
great to hear your perspective on this. thanks! and dont suffer through more she hulk!
Im looking forward to gandalf s spinoff show about where he was a ninja
because someone in my family decided to try out amazon prime  I actually  watched  the first two episodes of rings of diversity. watched in quotes  since I ended up either falling asleep or looking at my phone. it was boring and was only tolkien in name. even if we were to overlook the politics  what Imanaged to see came across as just another generic fantasy as opposed to the unique epic that was the hobbit and lotr.thus I have to agree with a certain assessment of the show I came across  why bother even wasting money on the lotr name  the material they re even allowed to use is woefully limited  and they re clearly just making their own thing. normies who have only gone as far as the peter jackson films will likely be  meh  over this  and tolkien fans will rip this a new one  therefore ensuring there will be even less people watching this. using lotr and tolkien s characters and universe arguably had a negative impact on the series and likely would ve been better off without it in every conceivable way.
stay awesome melo!
that positive review like barely talked about the actual content of the show lol
its been documented that they used review bots to pump up the scores.
I love how everyone who gave a positive review is harping on about the budget. dark and breaking bad combined had a lower budget than riverdale  and nothing short of a lobotomy is an excuse to call riverdale the better show
this goes to prove money cannot buy everything  people will do what they wanna do. you cannot control them with money completely.
I got half-way thru e1 last night  had to shut it off as the dry heaves were too much to bear
to make their one show to rule them all  . their agenda could hardly be more clear at this point.
as I watch this video its currently sitting on an audience score of 35  with over 10300 reviews.
the beacons have been lit!  tolkien calls for aid!and fans will answer...
oh I bet it will change television forever. just not the way they think it will.
episode 1 was absolutely amazing    people are just haters
seen ye over with the drinker and crew the other night melonie.thought you came off a little meek. cumon mel  big ovaries!!
I just cant wait for the memes.
I think Imight go back to netflix. at least stranger things season 4 was good and there s season 2 of arcane to look forward to.
most expensive fan fiction ever .
love ya  mel! keep it up!
guy-ladriel was breathtaking. I want an orc to say   what are you  man-elf  . I am in transition  orc. I assure you  I will transition infinitly better than you!  then becomes she-hulk and twerks.
might as well repurpose all that wasted money and actually give us more riverdale or something. that d be way better. or give the rest to actual tolkien fans who ve made great lore videos and even fannade movies that were way better and closer to the source material. so they can make better films to inspire the masses to perhaps come together and make a seriously amazing film to get the attention of some men and women who are skilled cinematographers. maybe even ex weta members and so on so we can make something so much better to replace rop. think of all the amazing art out there nowadays! even the stuff alan lee did was phenomenal!  even amazing cosplays and art done by men and women of various countries. many chinese have done many nice cosplays of the characters such as fingon  turgon  finw  and so on. so beautiful and the amount of work put into the clothing was out of this world.
I will watch the first  2 I guess  episodes and give it a chance. the first 2 episodes  side by side  will get a lot of views with all the hype rop has gotten. what counts are the following episodes. if views sink like a brick  which seems likely  that will be the judging of it.
as an englishman  we dont claim this series to be canon.
companies create previews so people will have opinions about a show before they watch it...  they are of course hoping for   it looks amazing  cant wait   but when viewers watch a preview and say  this looks terrible  Im not watching  they complain...  how can you have an opinion when you haven t watched the show   thats what ads are for! dont blame people when your ad sucked!
the audience score is at 38
all media in this country is owned by 6 corporations.  this convergence eliminated many of the old studios   enveloped the press. this process isn t finished. when it comes to reviews  people need to know for who the reviewer is working.  and to find an honest review  you have to find a competitor.  entertainment weekly is obviously owned by one  of amazon s competitors.
critics dont really critique objective qualities anymore stuff like cinematography  acting  direction  writing  and effects they review with a critical theory rubric. ps the article is trying to hold audiences hostage to the huge budget of the show. they know what is truly on the line is the intersectional world view in fantasy. they want people to tune in and accept the wokism to preserve the future of big budget fantasy. news flash game of thrones already cemented the demand for big budget fantasy!!
I didn t know this site wasn t legal to watch shows  I swear!
I once saw galadrrrrreil kill two orcs in a bar.. with a quill..
where this series is heading
the problem is that the haters are going to rate it 1 10 and fanboys are going to rate it 10 10  so you cant really take either of those scores seriously.  I figure most people are going to like some stuff and hate some stuff and net out around 6.5 7  probably not going to be a total loss  but also probably wont live up to the hype. I guess we ll all see in a few hours!
the critic rating is basically a measure of how well it upholds establishment narrative. its a seal of approval from the political class.
its the mac attack!
the only ring galadriel wont be getting is a wedding ring. gogo strong independent women.
there s so much traffic on this video  I will have to see it tommorow
just finished both episodes. I enjoyed what I saw and heard. music is good and the visuals are nice. I haven t seen any reviews  but so far I like it more than anything disney has done with star wars.
looking forward to showing amazon what we think of this by never watching it.  evil cannot create anything new.
yea a she hulk reaction could be interesting
Ive already completely ignored the existence of the hobbit movies and I have even less motivation to watch amazon butcher the greatest fantasy ip in history.
Im good with the movies.
...but why tho seriously...why waste your time  there are better  more worthwhile endeavors  in nerdom alone  let alone life...
exactly. this is why I like knights watch which is great content
Ivery much doubt any real fans would ever rate this above a 4. 5 would mean it was passable  which it just isnt. it has shat all over tolkiens legacy.
an honest opinion is about a 1 maybe 2  it is garbage  tolkien if alive would go postal on them for this dumpster fire. even entertainment weekly completely trashed it and they never trash hardly anything.
I d love to see another she-hulk review. someone s gotta throw a rational take into the mix.
donlemonas is laughable  but the other elves are kind of worse. jackson s elves  except haldir  had this otherworldly  ethereal look. bezos  elves look like you slapped spock ears on me  my dad and the 6 10 blonde chick  who works at the corner store.
of course we would like you to review the she hulks cant let you suffer alone though we can do it together  its not hate watching if your going to review it for this channel I can not let you suffer alone
there s so much out there to watch  play  read and even do.  I dont think these people realize how many fans and potential customers they are losing with this woke agenda!
oh  they are  mel  they are! and its bad right now  its laughble!
paid off hack reviewers no longer hold the sway they used to 20 years ago. the two episodes were mediocre to extremely underwhelming at best. this wont be the water cooler moments in the workplace outside of youtube and paid sponsored twitter tweets. house of the dragon has nothing to worry about.
I can guarantee they are removing a ton of reviews.
rings of prats...will rule none.
the entertainment weekly one was brutal and truthful about how awful amazon lotr is. she-hulk is getting positive review bombed by wokesters  it was truly horrible. not sure if she-hulk or amazon lotr was worse at pushing the message more than a decent story  at least lotr does not push open hatred of a group of people like she-hulk does.
I lke when celebron took a jurney without gayadriel talkin about haradrim of mirkwood
I watched an episode of it and if Im being as honest as I can be without getting annoyed that they are probably going to do a lot of stain glass bashing of tolkien s work -- I think its just kind of boring. its another high fantasy show that we have tons of and does nothing interesting. it was the same issue I had with that other high fantasy show they had on amazon with the fairy chick -- it just wasn t interesting. then  there is the stupid diversity checks they are throwing in there for...  reasons   all in all I d maybe rate it a 5 of 10 as there is some pretty cool looking cgI in it.
no they will be talking about the good memes.
in the land of the blind melonie mac is a visionary.cheers.
the remedy is piracy
made it halfway through episode 1 and was bored to tears. Im not giving them anymore of my time. I d rather watch she-hulk week to week than this and thats just fucking depressing man
perrI nemiroff is a sweet human. she may have some odd takes but she doesnt hate you. !
hey if you zoom in on the dwarf queens head... you can see some white stuff... her hair is definitely lived in
people will be talking about the house of the dragon  not rings of power. the one is an interesting fantasy series  which is adding lore with each episode dropping   the other isn t even part of its own lore  which makes consuming it pointless .
this what happens when activists take over the thing you love.
they look like elves from some high school drama xd. teen angst elves.
oh ya plus wokesters doing positive review bombing and paid amazon trolls doing positive reviews.
@dean firnatineÂ  that fat amazon tv marketing budget didn t just go on badly edited teaser trailers and day trips for easily bought-off influencers. it is harvesting time down at the bot farm.
I love how the  positive review basically told us  like this and it will be good for us all in the form of future television production . so they ve called us racist for rejecting it and now they re saying we ll all benefit if the show is a success.
hey I would love for you to do a video to explain woke culture. its devise topic  but I hear mixed opinions on what the true meaning is. I here woke this  woke that  I just want a clear cut answer lol
I like it the show
there is a legion of haters that now have to keep on lying to cover theire  asses.the show is goooood and it will be epic.
some people are saying that the show has surprising quality. but I haven t confirmed if they ve gotten amazon gift cards yet or not...
galadriel is supposed to be evocative of the virgin mother  not ned stark or conan the barbarian.
glitzy costumes and breathtaking scenery do not a classic make....

I torrented episode 1  but episode 2 is yet to download  I will have to see what all this hype is about. I feel like you are jumping on the hate train melonie  if it turns out to be so awful  hands down I will apologize for calling you a clout chaser and jumping into the hate hype
it was worse then were thought it was. and I thought it was going to be garbage. how did they make something worse then garbage.
the fantasy show to ruin them all hash tag rings of chowder
welcome back boom
rings of pooper
boom!
good video melonie
question. are there any obese elves in the rings of power  cause if there are no obese elves  then it isn t a truly diverse show.
hey where is your reviews on she-hulk
not surprised that rings of power got review bombed. no one asked for it.
aw sten syb lee  ostensibly.
the dumpster  thats where its heading.
when I saw the picture at the bottom of jack shepherds review I thought well this looks rather nice  maybe I should watch the show.saw at least 6 reasons to watch it. imagine my disappointment when I saw the  sponsored links  part.
yes other ways  nudge nudge  wink wink  say no more...... yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
good no taika for thor finally we may get a good thor film  oh wait crap its still trash disney we will never get a correct thor film
even if you hate watch it  youre contributing to the problem. you need to blacklist it off your mind.
she hulk video!!
I wont watch it  period. not just because of the race swapping. I can get past some of that  except it just shows where their focus is at. when they re focused on quotas and shit you know the writing is going to be trash. but just the way they did galadriel s character is enough for me to take a pass on the whole damn thing.
amazon is going to lose sooooooo much money on this.
she hulk vid plz
the first episode was ruff
os-ten-sibly
is it wrong for me to sit and listen to a tuber and think  sit on my face  then think woah steady of chap. or am I just human

comment for tomb raider
as per some elrond is gay in this series.  im confused now coz movies abt 3rd age n this is 1st age.. issue with now most of the series coz they only want the massage to be out. no great storytelling
couldnt even get through half of episode 1. mary sue elf is horribly written and wtf did they do to elron
sorry but this video didn t start with  whats up my boomers !  so Im confused...
an ultra maga waterfall
one of my good friends was very disappointed when I said I refuse to watch this travesty of a show
maybe like she-hulk you can have advanced screening  but you have to say only positive things
why make a review about a review of a show  just watch the series and then talk.
cant wait to see that new zulu warrior movie where they have that one white female zulu warrior chieftain .
I understand the need to reach a broad audience  but the panderfest ultimately shoots itself in the foot. if there is no character or identity  who wants to waste their time with that
not that I want you to suffer...but you have to review the twerking she hulk episode for lulz
this bird no zero about tolkien or anything to be honest
this show sucking would surprise absolutely no one.
please dont subject yourself to she-hulk.what is it with epic stories all this last decade. everything is dark  brooding  foreboding  world shattering... can we just get some simple stories where people dont have to save the world  universe  multi-verse
this show is disgusting. I am tired of men being trashed down because of their gender without a reason....
the reviews are manipulated..... no way people like this
the writing is bad.  people are getting lost in how pretty it is.  the dialog and plot are soooo weak that its comical.  I am definitely not a writer and could do better on most of the dialogue.
it looks like a load of bollocks
dont do it  we dont wanna see you suffer!!!!!!  she hulk
many do not want to support these hollywood websites and publications
ya funny how that would not go over well
the funny thing is the good reviews are not good.
pop culture started to die around 2005-2008.
shoving diversity everywhere it doesnt belong is not entertaining  this looks like a parody of the original to me.
I saw it last night. it was as bad as everyone thought it would be. a few nice shots but otherwise boring  cringe  poorly written tripe. cgI and action scenes are pretty bad too.
Im not watching she hulk so I vote dont review it unless youreally want to.
from asia  we are tired of your political push. I just want to watch a damn good movie.
first
give it a chance people have to lower there expectations a bit. its never gonna be full like it was back in the day. in fact many new movies or shows are not was television and movie were in past. we have to accept that and appreciate tv has it is  and stop focusing thinking about whats the woke stuff in this movie or thatseries. like I swear some people just over analyse a show and focus on negatives stuff and they dont let themself enjoy the movie in the first place. like just look how   for exemple geek n gamers subs are always angry  unsatisfated and argrevated all the time. these channel are so negative all the time and its not healthy. anyways like your channel youre not a hater at all
soy boy wants ppl to accept garbage   not voice their opinions. no thank you. there s so much channels spinning this show positively yet u came here to cry.
no sir  I will not eat dog shit on a moldy bun. I want a hotdog  just sell me a hotdog.
