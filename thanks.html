<p>Photos we took while interviewing streamers, mods, and viewers what they would want out of a streaming platform and tools</p>

<p>Ideas for this and feedback given on by streamers and stream lovers at Pax East, Pax West, Pax South, Vidcon, TwitchCon, Ohio State 
University, University of Cincinnati, 1871 Chicago, Too Many Games convention, and more! 2018-2019. Many thanks to those who attended those conventions and tech meetups and presentations and gave feedback and ideas for what this project is and is to come.</p>

<p>
In 2015-2018 we watched, chatted, moderated and financially supported a lot of live gaming streams on Youtube, Twitch and then Mixer.  In 2019, we had to take some time off to deal with some personal issues. We have noticed that stream and channel growth has somewhat hit a plateau for many independent creators. So, we will do what we can to build and launch things to hopefully help jump start channel growth again. In 2020, a world health event has forced us to stay inside. We want to use this extra time inside to start a mini renaissance of positive creativity at this time of so much destruction, turmoil and negativity. We want to turn this negative year which affects on our mental and personal life into new postive good things to give out, and we hope you enjoy what we have to offer.
</p>

<p>
  Q: Is this a large company behind this? Is this a full time company?
</p>

<p>
  A: No. This is a creative side project in our off-time in quarantine.
</p>

<p>
  Q: How are you going to do clips better and more high res than X platform?
</p>

<p>
  A: We are not. We are going to innovate on other aspects of stream clips and stream features. We are small and can take in streamer input from you and play around with new ideas without a large board to approve everything.
</p>

<p>
  Q: What is the end goal of this?
</p>

<p>
  A: The End Goal is so you as a streamer/organization/moderator can be more on top of your game and help you look better as a streamer.
</p>

<p>
  Q: Is this free?
</p>

<p>
  A: Currently, yes it is, with paid add-ons.
</p>

<p>
  Q: Who owns or funds this?
</p>

<p>
  A: Currently, this is 100% owned and funded by the founder and developer only.
</p>

<p>
  Q: Who will this help?
</p>

<p>
  A: Live streaming for concurrents of 10 - 10,000. To use stream tools effectively, you probably need a group of a few regulars to a mid-large chat to see an impact from using them. If you average 5,000 or more viewers, you probably have a tech or management team to help you instead.
