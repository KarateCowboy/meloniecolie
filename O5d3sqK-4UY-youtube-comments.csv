what s crazy about the mk11 costumes is that the modesty kick was ultimately pointless. many female fans  myself included  were deeply insulted  and in the end  they caved and gave players the mk trilogy era costumes anyway.
why do they care so much about video game female cup sizes.this is getting played out.congratulations melonie  you are seriously chill to listen watch.
not enough people have the spine to truly stand up for faith without compromising to the woke mob.we need more people like her!
its not surprising that the person who wrote this article also reviewed a pokemon game  and complained that the game had  too much water.  she also said that there wasn t enough diversity in days gones  enemies  even though the actual disease in that game caused people to lose their skin pigmentation  and was explained in the game. last but not least  she tried to pull a  meto  and get somebody s reputation ruined  and it backfired on her  although the recipient still defends her to this day because he s scared of her. the fact that this person still has a job in gaming is pretty sad  but not surprising at the same time.I would love if you did a video ripping apart anita sarkeesian  and her various lies over the years!! that would really make my day lol
good to know melonie will always keep us abreast of such important topics.
I dont push my religion on anyone  but you have freedom of speech and should use it. if I was traumatised I could just skip it. seems a petty criticism. I love the video s and Im thinking about keto. I hope everything is great for you and your blessings multiply.
I notice your cat often leaves the room right as you start filming. I assume  in its cat brain  it is thinking   oh great...she s meowing at nothing again.  and tells its cat friends   I think she needs to go to the vet. yeah. she just sits there and meows at a black fuzzy toy she got recently. she does it for like half an hour sometimes  I just have to leave the room.
hey mel! congrats on the rise of your channel!  Im digging the format.  from what Ive observed  you ve broken down your videos in a subtle  yet very organized way!  and of course  youre delivering  daily bread .  hope you make the sweet 16!  as for tifa   all I can say is  if folks like  the classics    tifa was restored  via mods.  @_@
I feel its refreshing that yourecit Bible verses and talk about pop culture another great video was not expecting game characters bra sizes but have to agree with your assessment keep up the good work.
of course it was kallie  too much water  plagge who wrote this article.
keep up the excellent work  melonie. youre killing it!
never heard people saying tifa had a b cup in the remake  what I did hear people saying was that her chest got nerfed and square also made her wear more clothing  which they did do.also for some reason yuffie somehow stole tifas missing boob fat and increased her own chest size...
Bible citations dont stop me as an atheist from occasionally getting a burger at in n out  they print a Bible citation on all their wrappers .  its not gonna stop me from seeking out your take on games and pop culture.  also  Im relieved gamestop isn t publishing detailed analysis of male package sizes.
you are almost there for 25k. I am glad you are doing this amazing. always will support you  melonie mac go boom! keep it up.
tifa s body type  is  diverse as far as ff goes...she s the only character I know of who is hyper-feminine. the rest of ff characters are usually more realistic  celes . also how do you think the fandom would react if aeris or yuffie were to suddenly get a boob job  probably the same way as tifa getting breast reduction surgery dont you think  its called changing what has already been established by canon. also  for those future crazy cat ladies out there  take note  if you feel intimidated over a fictional  ie. not real  character  then you dont  have  any sexual marketplace value to worry about loosing.
Im a recovered roman catholic and I find it interesting to see the scriptures that were forced upon me  and they really were  being embraced by someone else and getting what it means to them is pretty amazing.
I saw that gamespot tweet like 2 days ago and read the article and thought it was stupid timing. watching your video just now  I realized the article is from 2019  when the tifa b cup thing was in full swing I believe  so I guess the article was actually justified at the time  and much like you  the writer was pretty spot on about both her actual cup size and about the fact thatsports bras make boobs look smaller. as for the tweet about the article now  Im pretty sure that is just a gamespot thing  they randomly tweet old articles sometimes to drum up more views.
article about video game bra sizes...with hard hitting reporting like this  its a wonder why these companies are going out of business.
serious me  Im not a religious person myself  but I really dont mind you talking about yours. it informs your opinions for the better and I dont mind italso serious me  man they  downgraded  kitana from mk9 to mk11
surprise  here s my butthole  bumper sticks  shaker bottles  key chains  and pencils now available in the merch store
which were the modest of the series tbh.so kinda of a half measure.
not just costumes.notice how all male fighters are idealized fitness models  but all female fighters have such average body types.
well not the Goddess sindel.mmm mm. just my favorite but anyways hah.
@charming peasant  while a fat man didn t complain that the guys in mk got rippedwhamen you know what Imeant  complain that the girls in mk is too much of a  perfect woman .
@      whamen   thats an unattainable body standard! me  points to 90s fitness centerfolds
yeah  but none of that is important. those sons of bitches didn t put ermac in the game! fucking ermac! then  they basically combine ermac with shang tsung and they actually thought that was ok  no. hell no  its even worse than not including him at all.its not like we re talking about stryker or something  this is ermac. if scorpion and sub zero are in the game  then ermac should be too  every single time.Im still super pissed about this  in case you cant tell
oh  and let s not forget how they completely butchered shao kahn. it was already bad enough that they kept trying to make me actually believe that luI kang ever had any chance in hell of beating shao kahn  but now kitana just comes in and takes him out like nothing  did they forget who their own God damn character is  if there was ever even a remote possibility of kitana being able to not get completely stomped on by kahn in literally any situation ever  then she would ve stepped to him a long time ago.shao kahn is a half elder God  fucking dragon being who has no problem stepping to all the other elder Gods  completely by himself  all at the same time. he does not give a fuck  he ll talk shit to their faces while he fights them  he ll laugh right in their faces and tell them how pathetic they are. nobody  fiction or not  can fuck with shao kahn  but they tried to make him out to be a complete bitch in mk11. did they forget that even fucking raiden needed to be supercharged with the power of multiple elder Gods before he could even hurt shao kahn  there s a reason kahn is such a smug prick lol because he can back it up  and he knows it!
oh  and let s not forget  let s not forget...shao kahn created ermac. shao kahn is the shit.Im sorry lol this whole game is just bullshit.
the epitome of this is in how they basically gave jade a green   tannish-brown hijab with high heels! they even covered her up in all areas in a puritanical way while making her costume so bland and overdesigned  you get the impression they only went this route because jade herself was such a sensual and sexually charged character by design  so she had to be  subverted  to serve as a  take that!  to who the mk11 designers thought were the males that purposely designed her to be increasingly more risqu   which ironically was done by a woman btw  I know that kitana has a similar costume but instead of the hijab hood that jade got  she merely got her character staple face mask  with her costume still in the blue black with some teal silver here and there to match the fan. and yes  she also still has high heels even friggin  d vorah has high heels despite not wearing clothes  thats how I know it was meant to be subversive since they were so concerned with coverage of skin cleavage but were so lazy they gave most of the female characters a pair of high heels as to not  make them too manly . even cassie cage and jacquI briggs had to be overly covered up so they  couldn t be objectified by the male gaze  which is why the costumes clothing   armor pieces that had the least surface area ultimately became the most popular. mileena   sindel are the proof in the pudding  they had to return to objectification via the male gaze    in order to not just sell dlc characters ultimate editions but proved to the ultra puritans that work at nrs that its okay for women to objectify themselves
because most video game journolists absolutly hate video games and only write about them to make money so they try to focus on something they are more interested in like gender or bra size.
why do they call misogyny  then immediately talk about cup sizes
you can do it  but they will always come after you and I imagine its getting tiring and ppl just dont want to put up with it.
its quite contradictory because normally a religious person would see homosexuality as something wrong  even though you develop your sexual orientation during adolescence and so-called  conversion therapy  is harmful
@timothy marcoux  there are many many accounts that would disagree with you.the second comment there seems like conjecture.
@samuel grant  anecdotal evidence can be manufactured.
@samuel grant  my second comment isn t conjecture  its logic.
@timothy marcoux inconvenient truths can be ignored.your second comment is assumption.
@samuel grant  not assumption  again  logic based on what Ive seen within religious homes
still gets to me that articles like that over days gone actually made an impact. that cost them their sequel. that wasnt sonys game per say  it was bend studios ip that they worked on for years and years  developing a world past the first game  to then have that work scrapped because of a take on their game that was extremely misplaced. we are feeling the trickle down of that all over gaming  some break the mold but most function inside this closet of whats acceptable to appease these people.
my fav part was her completely glossing over the multiracial lesbian couple that played a huge part in the story.
sacred symbols fam
nothing says privilege quite like failing forward into position after position after blunders and controversies like these. I figure the  too much water  reviewer would be out of the games  industry by now  but sadly this is clown world.
@bigtuna9  days gone story was overwhelmingly long but kind of uninteresting  the game had many bugs and glitches at launch  textures wouldn t render. there was a glitch that blocked off a tunnel to a new area and completely stopped my progression of the game. anyone who bought this game at launch will tell you all of these things.
@underthegun897  I bought it at launch and had not one technical error or glitch ruining any sort of save or progress of my game. it was day 1 for me... and itsounds like you didnt get the secret ending. its a very interesting story  so personally I feel you are rowing that boat alone
@bigtuna9  I bought the game at launch and platinumed it. you were one of the lucky ones if you didn t experience any bugs
@underthegun897  im definitely lucky but yeah it ran flawless for me on my way to platinum. regardless  the game shouldnt of been passed up by so many for the reason it did.
apparently the  too much water  comment was about there being too many water types  it was poorly written
@timothy marcoux or anecdotal  unless you ve met every gay person who s ever died of stds.
@timothy marcoux thats your projection though. you cant know that for sure.
@samuel grant  the Bible itself has misconceptions about gender roles  sexuality and all that  so the Bible is where all that comes from.
the Bible s  misconceptions  are actually things that just dont line up with current western culture. things that people wanted to change  so they did  and take a look where we are now.also women have natural maternal instincts  as much as the west today tries to squeeze it out of them.men are naturally masculine  some more than others  and they re told that its toxic and they should be more feminine. if there s any social engineering  its now  not then especially the past few years . especially when trying to get the big one with the hairy chest to lactate and nurse a baby while getting the one who naturally lactates and cant lift as much to go chop down trees etc. you mention logic  but there s nothing logical about that.
@samuel grant  thats if you use the Bible as the  infallible and unquestionable  moral compass and word of God to mankind  something I dont believe  especially when the only evidence that  proves  its veracity is itself by saying that its true.
@timothy marcoux its actually an official historical document  and one of the most used documents by archeologists.
@samuel grant  yes  Im not questioning whether it exists or has archeologically proven facts  Im just questioning its role as a moral compass  especially since paul said that women should remain silent within the church and shouldn t have a teaching role  all the while listening in complete submission.
@timothy marcoux moral compass  do unto others as you would have others do unto you.  good source.the women in the church in corinth at the time tended to gossip quite a bit  paul corrected that.there were plenty woman leaders in the church.
@samuel grant  it also says that crows eating the eyes out of someone is a reasonable punishment for someone who dishonors their father and the only logical thing for God to do to anananias and sapphira for lying about the proceeds from selling their land that were to be donated to the apostles was to strike them dead. let s just leave it at we agree to disagree
@timothy marcoux  proverbs 30  17 is saying how important it is to respect your parents. when Jesus said  if your right hand causes you to sin  cut it off  he wasn t saying to dismember yourself.ananaias and sapphira tried to decieve God. someone who believes in the creator of the universe might have more regard for such an offense.
@timothy marcoux to take out opposing nations.
@samuel grant  doesnt justify killing children  sorry  thats where I draw the line
@timothy marcoux it was either those other nations who rejected and cursed him or his chosen children. some people from those other nations married in  like ruth and rahab  both who were in Jesus  genealogy  and made it a more diverse people.he was willing to  and did  send his only begotten son to die for the sins of those who rejected and cursed him. he isn t human  so we cant understand his methods  but we cantry.
if Christians were like you I would have not hated them for a few years. thankfully all I needed was to be alone in peace.I dont wanna to push my atheism on you  so may your chosen deity bless you  ps  maybe this is what has happened to the first woke and sjws generation  they were holy bullied in the name of God for thinking different  and you know how judgemental and absolutist Christians can be demeaning and or making enemies of anyone who dares to not agree with them.part of me understand how the far left feels that grudge against Christians and it just feels bad  because for me  my peace was being left alone. if judgemental Christians hadn t made and turned them into enemies  there could been some respect  like dave rubin being gay and married speaking in favor of Christians and freedom in prageru.
eh  I get why its annoying  its like if you go to a political channel but every single video ends with a 10 minute segment where they re just playing lego  nothing wrong with playing lego  nothing wrong with playing lego on youtube. but its a completely irrelevant addition to the videos that just makes every video feel like a weird crossover style episode.
@dutchdread  even if you dont like it  its at least a seperate part of her video  thats tagged on at the end. the topic is over by then  and she doesnt bring up her religious views within the topic s discussion. it can be completely avoided if one chooses to  which isn t the case for sjw channels that always have some jab snide comment throughout their videos. I dont like coleslaw  but its in a seperate dish so its existence doesnt bug me. if they put it in my burger then there d be a problem because it can be avoided.
@mrshmuga9  yea but it could be better in how it is seperated. like marking the sections on the timeline but many people dont do that because reasons.
she is awesome. I am Christian but not religious.  I am spiritually Christian. I dont go to church I pray on my knees alone. I love this channel for the content. not the last part. but I appreciate her honesty and integrity
@mrshmuga9  well  for me  when I go to bed I usually turn on a video to fall asleep with  so I have something to listen to while lying there  but I do that on my pc  several meters from my bed. so when a video Im listening to suddenly turns into Bible verses half-way through that is annoying. solution is that I simply dont put on her videos when I go to sleep  but doesnt change that its an annoying thing to have to take into account.
if you believe in your religion then you should tell everyone. its not for you to keep to yourself.
its so annoying how I have to read these comments on how annoying it is thatshe puts Bible verses at the end of her videos. can y all stop posting these comments  im trying to read the relevant comments to the video title.
@justnobodybutme  annoying isn t it when youre trying to consume a certain content but then other content is randomly strewn in  xd
@hermit card  how many Christians have you actually met though because most Christians are like him. what tv portrays them as isn t completely true.
@justnobodybutme  its so annoying people are forcing you to read comments you dont like. we should censor freedom of speech to shut them up. right
@raifseverence  my gramma was evangelical she brought me for years to evangelical bubble  I grew up in catholic school  then in adventist high school  had jehova witness friends  I have  independent  Christians friends.I know perfectly all the biblical arguments you use to validate your group and claim all the rest of Christian groups are mislead  misguided  wrong  and their counter argument because I never grew up in single Christian bubble.and also I know how proud some not everyone  of them are to virtue signaling themselves as the good guys and even bully people they consider and judge  inferior  or  evil  for not obeying them. one of the commandments says sanctify the saturday  some evangelical kids didn t like me quoting the Bible itself  so they made their own mob. other commandments says about not worshipping any images of anything  catholics got mad at me and threw me a small mob... just like the far left is doing right now.so I appreciate the lessons I learned from Christians  because when the far left appeared  I already knew what how they behave.
@vincent_ graymore  while she wouldn t have to make a lot of chapters  it is more work. I ran a podcast for sometime  and even with software where I could make a time stamp  while recording  to mark off later  the process was still annoying. chapters time stamps are more necessary though when you have a dozen topics across 1.5-2 hours. out of her 30min videos there s at mod 3 chapters I could see  the intro  the topic  and the Bible verse. but two of those things amount to a few minutes in total and are very clear where they stop and start  she doesnt go back and forth between them in the middle of the topic . so its not really a big deal.
@dutchdread  ya I can understand why it might be annoying in your specific circumstance. but I think too many people complain thatsomething isn t 100  exactly as they want  when so many options exist  or that 95  of the content catering to you isn t good enough . in terms of watching normally  where you dont have to wake up to turn it off   its like  the last 2 minutes of a 20-30min video. its effectively the same thing as an outro. sometimes I skip people s outros not because there s even an  ideological disagreement . its just  youre doing your outro thing. Im already subbed  so I dont need to hear several minutes of being reminded to follow you on 10 platforms and donate money.
@hermit card   sanctify the saturday  is a real weird translation. Im curious to know where you heard it.
@bootysweat fights  im not english native  so I guess  sanctify  is not the right word in english. also I was not quoting  just summarizing in short words.there you go the actual quote from Bible exodus 20 8-11new international version8  remember the sabbath a  day by keeping it holy. 9 six days you shall labor and do all your work  b  10 but the seventh day is a sabbath c  to the Lord your God. on it you shall not do any work  neither you  nor your son or daughter  nor your male or female servant  nor your animals  nor any foreigner residing in your towns. 11 for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth  d  the sea  and all that is in them  but he rested e  on the seventh day. f  therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.pd  so  do you obey this commandments or is one of those things that conveniently gets  reinterpreted    adapted for new audiences  or  the new pact changed it   brace yourself for new woke progressive  re interpretations  pd  regardless what I personally think about this  good luck convincing a catholic  or witness of jehova the Bible is right about saturday   Christians cant agree with Christians
Im an atheist myself but I 100  agree with youthat criticism was extremely petty and felt like bullshit. who cares she wants to read a Bible verse at the end. not like the Bible has nothing of value to teach people  there s plenty of teachings of the Bible which hold value in the world and just because I dont  believe God exists and that the Bible is just a big ass fairy tale doesnt automatically mean there s nothing of value to be learned from it  I have actually read the Bible twice
@mrshmuga9  that coleslaw is a good analogy. especially since I love burgers and always hated coleslaw lolz
@perroden spartan b-312  who even likes coleslaw  lol.
good luck on keto!  done it lots  it can be hard but really works well
@joseph steward  thanks    I hope it will give me results
aw  thank you so much
obviously  those on pc can do whatever they want. the criticizing  and fighting back is mainly for those of us on console. we deserve a choice.
@boss ross  oh I agree that console gamers should not be beholden to revisionism and censorship by decree of resetera.  in a perfect world  the console gamers would be able to enjoy games like we pc master race do.Imean  who wouldn t want to play as rick or morty in devil may cry 5
@boss ross  your choice was to not buy a console.
I agree
didn t the apostle paul tell women to remain silent
@timothy marcoux  in what regard and what context  just because he said that once about a specific topic means very little. I am no theologiet but I feel there was a little more to the conversation than that.
@balketh  1 timothy 2 12  but I suffer not a woman to teach  nor to usurp authority over the man  but to be in silence.
@balketh  verse 11 also says  a woman should learn in quietness and full submission
@timothy marcoux  still I feel I am missing context  I will look into it later have a great day
same  journo  who  reviewed  cyberpunk 2077 without playing the full game. surprise!
to be fair there4 was alot of water pokemon in that game but yea  that critique was kind of stupid the way kallie used it.
p yea but yuffie is still a dangerzone. many people want nude mods of her but she is underage in ff viI  not doc and ac .
@vincent_ graymore  rule34 artists  I like to live dangerously!
youre the best!
keep doing what makes you happy  Im glad you put your religious talk in the end and announce it when you do it. I usually skip it but it doesnt bother me that you do want to do it on your channel. I love your take on subjects and thats good enough for me. I respect the fact that you are religious and even admire that. God bless you
this channel has grown as it has for couple of reasons my dear friend...I shall list what comes to my humble mind  1  captions and topics are spicy but not clickbait2  you dont bend the knee to corporate propaganda and woke mafia3  you are legit a gamer. not a fake  superfan  4  you have the presense of mind and understanding of how things are becoming and where there should be a line.5  ahem... it helps that you are pleasing to the eye xd
just peeped the cara dune cardboard standup in the background I see you are a person of culture as well. I got the  arms crossed defiant  posed cara dune.
I dont care about women s bra size in video games  I care about their character development. btw melonie I hope you win this competition!
I agree with your thoughts on tifa. I think some of us were just worried at the time because we had seen what was happening to other female characters.
another great video from you. I love how you stand up toward the woke people. you make good points over what you talk about.
this topic combines two of my favorite things.  and also gaming.
melonie  your principles and the way you stand behind those personal beliefs is outstanding and admirable. I have big time respect for you.  bless you and your family.  stay strong.
a big one that I really hate is what they did to samus from smash 4 to smash ultimate. they did her so dirty. making her more muscular is cool  but why did they have to make her so much flatter  and also her face looks weird in ultimate compared to smash 4
the funny thing is that kallie only has it part right but falls flat on the math and its relation to sizes...  source   I used to help make dresses at a custom wedding gown shop.
tifa s portrayal in remastered was so beautiful I actually switched to team tifa  from aeris.
I tend to mostly prefer women to have some muscles on them in games too. seeing tiny aloy with noodle arms push down trees and tug walls down just makes me wonder if she has some unexplained super powers.
oh jeeze kallie plagge is the one who wrote that pokemon review on 3rd generation   too much water.  and complained about the zombies being too white in days gone. Imean days gone has performance issues but did not deserve a 5 10.
Im new to watching your channel but Im enjoying it. I really like the way that youread the scripture at the end of the episode. I also like that youre not afraid to share your Christianity. God bless you and your family. duane.
Bible verses  gaming  and bra sizes ! !  yep  dope channel!!
I had a vietnamese friend in high school who s sister was 5 2 and had c cups. looked just like tifa. on a smaller body frame  things can look bigger than they would otherwise.
when blue checks  corporations and media outlets start anything with  we need to talk about...  you can be sure its something petty that doesnt need to be talked about.
great content keep up the good work girl.
hey melonie great content. I especially liked the scripture reading and breakdown at the end.
tifa lockhart s cup size looks more apparent when she s in her blue dress  especially when you compare her to aerith. it would make more sense to give tifa more muscular thighs considering she s a fighter  but they probably thought it was too masculine maybe idk.
depends on what type of game it is
ffs  has she ever written an article that isn t whining about inane bs
sounds like she s just jealous xd
she works for people with small hats and oddly shaped noses
I liked tifa s portrayal in the remake. wasn t perfect  but it worked. I liked jessie a lot too  definitely went up more then a peg or two. what I hated was how they changed the story and cut the game short but padded with tons of fluff. Im an eternal final fantasy fan  but I just cannot forgive that. when you change a property so it doesnt resemble the original in any way  I argue it is not the same.
I agree  tifa was kicking folks into the stratosphere  she could ve stood to be as cut as cloud.  I however was completely happy with her remake look.  but yeah... she would ve looked nice with more definition too.
thank you for this verse. Ive really been working on this the past couple weeks. I really needed this.
here from the start even before quartering shouted out your channel    was introduced to you for the first time on chrissy s podcast and started watching daily videos ever since. love that you own being a tomboy and dont take crap from nobody. some may say that your voice is grating but I say that itsounds great! I dunno but I love southern twang.
im not religious but that Bible verse really hit home.
I bet a lot of people would be interested in seeing the behind the scenes on the design of tifa.  these days I think systems.  so my guess would be they went round and round on how her design would fit in with the ensemble.
Im generally not interested in the Bible stuff myself  and just respectfully check out when it comes in. I d never suggest you should stop  though  and the rest of your content is worthwhile. keep doing you.
I think people are really sensitive and I didn t take the time to examine the ratios between the circumferences and get a realistic measurement. but I think they used a wiggle rule to get around to making tifa less feminine more masculine in order to skirt by and dodge fire from either side. which in a way is good game design  in another is sort of throwing out the trope they were aiming for in 1997 with tanktop no bra and suspenders. something we d be more likely see jessica nigry cosplay  not a girl out for a jog.
I was completely surprised by the Bible verse in the first video I saw of yours  but in a great way.  I find it very refreshing that you share your faith in this space.  you do you!
who else wish s melonie go boom and trillium would form a epic girl gamer duo  cuz I think it would be an interesting fun combination.  maybe stream with jeremy of the quartering once in a while to change things up
the thing about sin is that I think its an archery term meaning to miss the mark. makes sense when you think about it...messing up is one thing  but if you take it as a learning opportunity  you tend to improve yourself as a result of it. mankind was never meant for perfection  because if that was the case  where would there be room to improve
Im traumatized!! first I sat through a video where women talked about the spiciness of pokemon now youre talking about tiffa s bra size.  I learn something new every day. I learned women can judge cup size by picture unlike what they told me in the first episode of ncis.
congrats on the one month anniversary! or should I say boomaversary
I dont mind you sharing your faith with us.  Im not  in the faith   but I can still listen  and the messages do have value.
surprise! here s my butthole!  lmaooo your original content was great  but this go boom stuff is on another level. keep up the awesome work !
I am so glad I rediscovered this chick. totally forgot melonie s name after having followed her 10 years ago...
she s kind of talking to people like they are stupid. thats me.  Im stupid.
Im a new subscriber and Im loving itso far God bless to you melanie
2 18 a wild zoe has appeared  throws pokeball .  ya act like I just said  oh here s the gaming video  surprise here s my butthole  bwahahahahaha  Im dead. thanks for the laugh.
complaining about cup size is something an anime character would do  and they hate anime!
in an interview with japanese gaming publication famitsu  developer square enix said it did reduce tifa s breast size and explained the decision.se has given actual size for tifa. bra size is a japanese g70  which is roughly a size 32  ddd. it is in the remake ultimania.
you deserve all the credit!
what people are not realizing is that if you need to come out and say  I am for  fill in whatever    or whatever they are not really that. you do not claim what you are with words but through actions  if they are constantly coming out and claiming this or that they what they say they are. people need to call this out by saying  actions speak louder then words .
I guess its a slow news day at gamespot  lol. Ive been around long enough to remember the drama around jiggle physics. I know that a youtuber  liana k  has at times mentioned how men in the industry  such as the character designers and whatnot  dont really understand how female undergarments work. I could understand this being a topic of discussion for fashion costume design reasons  but outside of that  dont really see how its relevant.will they be doing an article on proper fit for men s jockstraps
its absolutely hilarious that you accidentally nailed the exact pitch for half of the mobile ads on my phone at 10 53
keep the content coming!!!!
I was part of h2o good times on halo reach custom games  we had game nights on halo reach where it was boys vs girls then it was mixed girl boys vs girls boys. most of the time the girls would work together and wipe the floor with the guys cause we would compete and trash talk who got the best score so we worried about beating the teammates score than actually working together  oh man good times.
my wife wears a b or a c depending on the bra. tifa is not either of those. lol
based on that polygonal tifa  we need to talk about shoe sizes.
wow  so were doing bra sizes now  good grief are these folks just bored  melonie you are great  really enjoy your content  keep it up and good luck.
10 45 its her channel she cantalk about whatever she wants. the whole point of having this channel to begin with is to have a venue where she can be free from restrictions and just be herself.but of course  you also had the right to not sub or watch the video if you feel so inclined.and let s not pretend  youre never going to go to any kind of church regardless so why even bring that up
followed you on twitter and now subbed here. cool youread a scripture. never be ashamed. youre awesome
you know  the more you mention the pms clan  the more I think Imight have known someone that was in it. idk maybe Im imagining things. lol
alrighty melonie  you haven t talked much about what games you be playin now. what s are you lookin forward to   mods also keep up the great work  youre channel is boomin!
they got parts of the remake with tifa in a dress so could easily compare with and without sports bra
100  agree that they should have made tifa more toned like her dissidia 012 character model.
this is why I sub to this channel. to guess game character cup sizes
I enjoy your videos. Im not a religious person and Imight stop the video before the Bible texts  but dont want you to stop you doing it on my account. its a part of who you are and I am glad you have the channel you do what you want on. wont stop me watching more of you stuff. mind you  Im sure there are plenty of people who would love to see  suprise butt hole ...
4 49 does actually bug me that tifa s arms dont look like the sort of someone boxing for 6 hours a day.  not like those of a woman who boxes 15 minutes a day  for that matter.I dont mind a little realism when it matches what your character does.
most of the time  I just weep with a world I grew up with  for over two decades  started in the nes days with mario bros and duck hunt with the blaster  and go from it causes violence  it causes this  it causes that  and now just to be dragged trough politics to try to push an agenda now that it could suit them.
I was looking at the g fuel hydration tubs and was wondering if you have any feedback or recommendations on the flavors available.
tifa at least a f cup
also tifa doesnt exist.
Imean  maybe the guy has different beliefs. youreally wanna pretend that a Christian wouldn t be clicking away from islamic verses that were in a gaming video  lol
@underthegun897 actively avoiding things like that is like you hear a burglar breaking in and you put on a headset and try to pretend thats not happening.I would think true believers of other religions would do the same wouldn t they
@wataru ikusabe  and here we go with her latest video about ms marvel  the character mentioning there is no brown girls from jersey as superheroes and being muslim is  woke  and  pandering   but someone mentioning biblical verses being in every video requires them to go find a safe space  the hypocrisy of right wingers is astounding
yep  I remember when video game magazines were about video games  pc magazines were about pcs and their components and software  and mtv was about music. those were the days!
@john crawford  I ll drink to that. I really miss those days.
oh yesss  the hydration line is my fav! favorites are blue rocket pop  mfam punch  and shiny splash
9 30 so  you are calling for tiffa to look more like normal beelstarmon from the digimon tcg instead of alt.art beelstarmon
the thing about the Bible  as someone studying history archaeology  and has actually had to take classes on it  is that lots of the teachings lean on both objectivity and philosophy - you can find similar philosophies is so many religions and texts  so its strange that people take offense to something just because the specific wording is correlated to the Bible
didn t they say tifa was wearing 2 sports bras  because 1 wasn t enough to keep them in place when doing acrobatics.also dont the japanese letter tifa s size differently than how the west would
just discovered you today. got yourself a subscriber!
Im an atheist myself and think the Bible is bs but I believe any person is allowed to believe whatever is right for them. this video was pretty fun to watch and actually liked how you approached when you were criticized about citing the Bible. subbed
boomers for teh win! and definately would like to try g-fuel if it would be available here in finland.
kenshin himura would have been part of the pms clan.  he was a legendary man slayer.  that anime is a bit on the older side  so this reference might be approaching boomer levels.
why aren t your uploads going to rumble as well anymore  I know its a smaller platform  but its good to keep building up alternate tech platforms.
good luck on the competition mel!!!!
I dont think most people were saying that tifa s boobs were small in a general sense  but they undeniably made them much smaller than they originally were. the devs even admitted that they d been forced by square enix s  ethics department  to make them smaller and change her outfit  so thatshe d be deemed less offensive. as for the original design being unrealistic  well  its an anime-style videogame. everyone is unrealistic. just look at cloud s sword  or barret s gun hand. no one seems to care too much about realism right up until it involves something sexual.
people that get angry about the cup sizes of fictional characters are the same people that call you a p-doh-file for being attracted to characters with average proportions. pretty sure average cup is like b in the us  excluding overweight people  as their proportions skew the data too far  and a in japan  where many games come from  especially the  controversial  ones .
Imean I guess.I learned about bra sizes from how to draw manga books.
one month 20k  subs awesome  and tifa is a g cup dayum hubba hubba   also I always like the verse of the day
so I think im a little late to pitch in on the gfuel carry.  I found your channel yesterday and I have been binging itsince!loving the vids!
the only thing I would add to that verse in james is itshows desire is not the same as sin so you know dont beat yourself up because something bad appeals to you  recognize it for what it is and avoid it.
personal accountability is the essential part of life that the woke crowd is missing.
as a gym but and consumer of gorilla pre workout gfuel as well I ll definitely use the code Im low in stock! gotcha homegirl awesome content  wholesome  Christian and gaming. so glad I found a new dope channel
well  technically  tifa rockin some g cups is not underwhelming.
psychotic man slayers as a female clan name may be the best pun ever
jeez first my friends call me a boomer for playing quake  now this.... I kid I kid. love the content keep it up
ohh  sarcasm  I am sorry. you mean owning your own feelings and direct them as needed  not because God said you should. however because you  know only you have to deal with you misdeeds while on this world. no matter how your religion may guide you or your personal morals  if you are any form on non-theist.  end sarcasm
ahhhh thank you so much!
whoa. if thats a g cup then Im definitely gonna need a longer alphabet for my skyrim girls.
-_- se has given actual size for tifa. bra size is a japanese g70  which is roughly a size 32  ddd. se has said that they did limit her boobs in remake  a design choice  which can be considered censoring  especially since the descision was aided by the  ethics department . I do not care about the actual size  she looks great.
basically its a video about melonie being jealous about tifa chest size
its ok melonie  there s no shame in being flat.
the content I subbed for
Im sure they also think that fallout teaches people how to build nukes  the diablo games teach you necromancy  and that there is too many crimes being committed in gta.
psycho man slayers is the perfect name for a band.
did you ever advanced to round 3  and if you did  how deep did you went in the contest  melonie
I have the distinct feeling that the people who are complaining about booba in video games are simultaneously cheering for of  sex workers .
cannot wait until grandchildren start asking  grandma  were you part of the woke mob
everyone has their own tastes  I personally like small to medium sized. when they are too big  they hang down to your stomach that looks kind of gross to me.
there s many Christian gamers out there including me. many channels do various content. if certain folks cant stand your mix of content then oh well. God bless sister.
love this channel
I actually listen to the verse this time. is itsaying all desire leads to sin  kinda like yoda telling you attachment leads to suffering  desire is not 100  a bad thing you know
samus aran of metroidmeryl silverburgh in metal gear solidlisa garland in silent hillmaria in silent hill 2these are my favorite videogame broads.
ooh  you had me at bra sizes!
military family  cute  gamer and Christian. you madam have created the perfect template for my future girl friend. thank you.
this is why I stay away from fake gaming news sites like nichegamer  kotaku  resetera  polygon  thegamer  pc gamer  gamespot  modern g4   whatculture gaming
melonie I recommend a game for you to check out warning you will be a typist expert when playing this game its 20 yrz old but still a banger its called dark age of camelot excellent game
surprise here s my butthole! it was all a lie  I want my money back.
I have no idea how you got that out of my video. I can admire someone else s assets without wanting that for myself  I am happy how I am haha
no not all desire leads to sin  but all sin is born from desire however. we have to learn self control.
ps  Im a professional graphic artist and I did a classic lara croft  mostly  the other day but when I try to post it in the comments it gets erased.   _
@jakemonster001  I do not think youtub allows you to post images in chat my friend.
@john la  ah  thanks man!
@jakemonster001  always welcome sir.
take it easy there  hotstuff
simpin ain t easy...
literally same
michael davis youre precious! good luck  mate!
Im honored that be considered sam! ima try some with your code.
I played a lot of games with customizable characters.  the sleaziest most sexualized glamours transmog presets were all female players.
I love the video and the message.
your subcriber count is soaring! keep it comin
we have to do something about this now. gamespot  thats just the beginning  soon  melonie wont even be able to wield two greatswords together for her grandma because its too phallic! and as for the tvs so called plan  the woke mob have no jurisdiction  they ll find you and make you squeal!
kitana definitely does not have b cups. I have b and they are very small. a s and b s dont have that much volume up top. I would guess a large full c.
I d imagine the reason tifa doesnt have muscle definition is because the devs are aiming at a japanese physical ideal...with big boobas. so she has a similar physical texture to aerith  just different proportions because both characters are being portrayed as aspects of a cultural ideal. nothing wrong with that  its the same reason cloud looks like a girl to a lot of western eyes  p
she got biggins  gurl!
you can judge the value of a person by the things they choose to complain about. .this quote may explain most of the woke peoples problem  nothing in nature can freeze a heart like years of being alone .
didn t square enix made tifa s boobas smaller in the remake  I remember hearing something something about that. I think they also made an  ethical department  for this kind of stuff... way to make me not buy their games. not because of smaller boobas  but because they want to tell me what is ethical... I bet that people in that  ethical department  are fully deranged. xd
@10 54 that wouldn t be traumatizing lmao. that d be funny as hell.
they re fuggles who think if they cover up all the people who bother to exercise  that they ll get dates because they re the only game left in town
I always thought I was a gamer but how dumb do I feel now ! I never even thought about bra size and fit once while gaming. to the people that dont like the Bible talk at the end  no one is making you watch it.
day 7 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me too.idk how you keep putting out these bangers every day but keep it up. love your based energy
happy women s day  mel!
cant watch you play elden ring because I want to beat it by myself unspoiled  but good luck. have you beaten dark souls yet  if not  I d watch you stream that.
why does this matter  I never heard anyone talk about the size of a male characters arms or chest size compared to the rest of his body. especially in fighting game where nowadays the female characters are covered more and purposely made less attractive like in mk11  for most of the female cast itseemed like they all had the same body type but with different heads  skin tone and costumes   which the designs were mostly bad   imo
I dont know what bras gotta do with a video games and killing bosses...
although I am not a believer  I find words of wisdom in these verses
that is what we need right now gamergate 2  what s your cup size.  smh
nah cloud is just a pretty boy   just like link  also wtf since when do they look like girls
I wouldn t really trust any measurements from the ff7 world. remember  in that world people say aerith is average looking. they just have waaaaay different standards. I wouldn t put it past them to think a d cup is tiny.
they are discriminating against the beautiful  thats so weird.  since I noticed most women judge physical looks and attributes first  when they choose to go on dates.  so we seeing many supermodels giving blue collar workers a chance now   I doubt it.this hasn t been my experience. you had to start your own business and get rich first.  before they start getting interested in the  real  you.
youre not a  pick me.  youre a first pick. them others just cant compete so they insult you. thats all they got.
I dunno I use tifa in dissidia for the vita n she looks fine to me also she is a pain in the ass to fight in dissidia
10 50ok that was unexpected.  lol!
talking about tifa  I find weird how she has trained so hard in something that requires confidence and bravery  yet she sometimes has a shy and fearful behavior on dumb stuff... while aerith  who has no close hand to hand training behaves more bravely and confident than tifa.in real life tifa would have the personality of a charismatic female ufc or wrestler fighter. maybe like gina carano  she s sweet  lovely  confident  brave before the mob a fighter at heart.
I haven t looked at a video game news article in ages because of the fact that they ve done nothing but preach politics rather than talking about the video games themselves. which is why I dont take them seriously anymore. lol
3 09 itstarts here
10 00person hears philosophical quote from famous author in a video   mm hm mm hm   nods silently in agreement person hears passage of scripture from the Bible in a video   rushed to er  developers ptsd  dies. rip.
I only have one complaint  I really like small boobs  so I get a bit grumpy when games only have females with huge balloons.  s
psychotic man slayers is funny  and simple.you are the first person open about the Bible  and even saying that you are a Christian.and unlike I saw a comment you mentioned in the other video I watched you are not pushing it and since I haven t been in church for a while now the verses are a breath of fresh air  I want to wait after my surgeryand get rid of my bag.the verse the first time pleasantly surprised me.
hey  Ive been looking into this carnivore diet.  looks good.  Im gonna do it.  I ll take some before and after pictures.  you want pictures    wink wink anyways  thanks for sharing.  keep thumping that Bible.
nou that would be a welcoming surprise
the people accusing tifa of having b cups are probably the same people who think that dd are the largest.
are we going to see you more on twitch
Imean if they beefed up tifa any more than they did then she would be bigger than cloud. I think she s perfect
14 52 the twitter comment is stating what alinsky tells them  the left  to do in rules for radicals.  accuse the other side of doing which you yourself are doing.
jeremy from the quartering shouted you out in a video. love your channel.
if remake tifa is a g cup  I wonder what size her classic fmv bust is supposed to be.
halo 4 rated m cortana gorgeous beyond belief and best 343I story campaignhalo 5 rated t cortana in clothes worst story campaignhalo infinite rated t cortana in tight suit but not naked story falls behind 4naked wasnt needed but it helped lol she lost a bit of charm  when you say cortana and someone answers the naked purple or blue or pink chick they have more of an idea of who she is vs now  you mean the blue friend to chief......no thats the weapon wait cortana was blue too agh!
thats exactly how I feel too! tifa s aesthetic is so amazing  but her personality is not tough enough for my taste
ah you dont get it. tifa got the hots for cloud. she can more than take care of her slef it just she will show her softer side to him or when she is around him.
@ladypepperkat  tifa crushing on cloud hard  I read the book trace of 2 pasts  she had a whole section thinking about him
pms  had to be changed from  psychotic man slayers  to  pandora s mighty soldiers    maybe the wokesters would prefer  pbs  --  pandora s box s schmucks.
psychotic man slayers   not gonna lie  I think that is funny. and have zero issue with it. its a clan name. likely for a game where the players are running around blowing up other players.
I think we should know your bra size so we can all be better whilst comparing video game characters
I seriously wish diversity was done right  and by that Imean they announced a new character  they would be announced by cup size.announcer  ...and this character will have a f cup  and this character will have a g  and this character will have an  m  cup!
neurons on for this one
on your commentary of james  I agree. being catholic  and accused of being  works based   there s definitely misconception there. everything you said was on point with my catholic faith as well  because we are all saved  not on our own merits  but through faith and the grace of God  who sent his only son  Jesus Christ  to save us from the bonds of sin. a lot of the confusion between catholics and non catholics tends to be on what happens after we ve been baptized  or otherwise have chosen to dedicate our life to Jesus. afterall  we are supposed to be walking a new life in the Lord  the chains of sin taken off us. but why are we still tempted by sin  as catholics  we use the term concupiscence to describe this. its a way of understanding that we still can be tempted while on our walk with Christ. going into fitness  st. paul did say our faith is like a race  wherein we train and condition not just our bodies  but also our spiritual life. while we may still be tempted to sin  in the end it matters the sort of spiritual  work out   wherein we rely on Jesus to help us through temptation  and to be there to help pick us up. while we cant rely on works  st. james does make a point in the 2nd chapter when comparing faith without works to seeing someone in need of clothing and food  and just stopping for a moment to tell them   go in peace! be warmed and filled.  for what sort of charity is that when not giving the person the things necessary for the body  its sort of like today s virtue signaling. sure  it might make the person signaling feel better about themselves  but it really does nothing to solve anything. when mother theresa was criticized for helping the poor in india  where some said what they needed was jobs  mother theresa basically told them that they who have the ability to create jobs can do so  but her work was to help heal their souls. and she did that  both through helping feed them and give them shelter  and by the charity thatshe knew was not merely her own  but came from God.
Im actually surprised it took until that awful forspoken video of theirs for me to see gamespot being clownish. then again  I really only used them for game trailers anyway
Im mixed race. hardly anyone cantell. I love when people try and discredit anything I say cause  youre white  lol
ah the endless debates between east and west fans on who is the best tifa vs lara.its a shame youre wrong mel  and while I accept you have a bias with the third hottest female character in gaming being your favourite  tifa   maI   lara   lolthere s a fundamental difference between the designs that were seen before and what are seen now. look up advent children s tifa for an example of them nerfing tifa s boob size. it isn t a joke to say they did it to appease their new home base of california.
I can flex my moobs
now while the article itself wasn t too bad  itstill had that  talking down to the reader  tone that I didn t like. I dont know if that was just played up for comedy or not  but for the most part  language like that rubs me the wrong way. there s a way to educate and inform without treating your readers like they dont know what a bra is.
meanwhile Im still waiting for someone to explain to me how big boobas on an entirely fictional made-up make-believe person is a bad thing. like  its pixels my dude. Imiss the days of  dont like it  dont play buy it.
world hunger  nah.ukraina vs russia  nah.video game bras  we must talk about this imediatly!
I agree with your analysis of the Bible verse. when God asked adam why he disobeyed and ate of the fruit  adam s reply of  the woman you gave me made me do it  didn t work. we are judged for our actions  but my hope is in Christ Jesus  who died for my sins and made me whole with our father. I look for your videos as a Bible study to daily feed in the word.
what s the story behind your profile pic  I remember the show!
next  we ll compare johnny cage s bicep circumference vs bmI compared to the rest of his body... oh wait. we just view buff men as buff men... why do we have to dissect fiction like this
so I would say that tifa s cup size is probably a double d but because she is so thin it appears larger than what it actually is. as for the that commenter that complained about youreading Bible verses  well thats just silly. even as an atheist there are some really good moral lessons to learn from the Bible that is also stated in a different way in marcus aurelius  memoirs. and as a catholic I appreciate that youread verses and then talk about them and try to apply them to your life. its good to see people of the faith trying to spread the wise words that is written in the Bible through discourse and discussion.
happy one month aniversary.
I would guess the people complaining about a  small chest  were comparing to the fmv s in ff viI where tifa looks absolutely gargantuan.  I was surprised at first and then as I got more looks I realized thatshe wasn t as small as my first impression had given me.
lol  biggest beefa with tifa
take it a step farther  thats why utopia is impossible. like you said  sin is only temptation because it is born of your own desire to begin with. all evil is born of the human heart and its desires. utopia presupposes a future state of man where we cantotally overcome evil and stupidity as a species  it is prerequisite to the condition of utopia. but because the human heart is the source of evil  and because desire for such is part of our very nature  we will never completely overcome it. we have to work very hard to be able to overcome it enough to form civil societies  and that is the best we can hope for.
a little off topic  but they completely fucked shao kahn in mk11  and I will never forgive them for it.shao kahn is to mk what eminem is to the rap game. here they are though  thinking the mk equivalents to everlast would ever believably be enough to even scratch the dude. its complete bullshit  and I wont stand for it.
I love the verse of the day
Im an atheist. I deeply value our western civilization that was built upon the values thatspawned from the Christian culture.
sadly I bought about 3 months worth of g-fuel with the code in the first week
to the first commenter about the Bible  it can be interpreted in your own way. the takeaway is to be a good person. love your neighbor. unless they dont clean up after their dog when it poops in your yard. it doesnt have to be religion telling anyone people to treat each other with kindness and respect.
while I dont agree with some of what you say in the Bible section and me being a muslim  I appreciate it.and about fighting with our desires  I remember that there was a story when the prophet mohamed came from a battle  he told those with him  now you are done with the small jehad  now the big jehad remains. and he means fighting with our desire for what is not allowed and not good for us.thank you
and these same people will talk about six packs or the size of packages and fail to see the hypocrisy.
over the years tifa has been coverd up more and more  but despite this it always has been a thorn in their sights that they never managed to fully get their hands on her  like they managed with lara croft  jill valentine and so many others. though I think its just matter of time since square also has fully commited themselves to the ideaology of hatred towards feminity  and of course the love for androgyne. people think the last 12 years have been bad  but I predict this gen is going to be the most censored   androgynous ever. especially on console  though steam is also putting up more and more barriers. I think new  store  platforms are needed to go around the ever stricter guidelines on the big platforms. as bad  gate keeping  is  its absolutely necessary to do this to new creative free gaming platforms  to ensure no political or religious group movement can hijack it. there simply is no rhyme or reason with these extremists.luckely we already see this happening in comics  where indepdent and industry vets found new ways to find their customers and give their decades old custoemr base the comic experiences they want. despite the gaming world always is behind on these matters I think a simular development sooner or later will happen to pc gaming. consoles sadly will be lost for quite some time and be held hostage by this hate movement.
push up and demI cup bras have men fooled into thinking that all women have large breasts.  its rare to find a woman with a small band size and naturally large cup sizes.  Im hoping thats what she was complaining about in the article.
you go ahead and preach away melonie. Im a life-long atheist and it doesnt bother me in the least. ignore the haters and you be you.
wish Christians were more outspoken about their faith like you. we are seriously socially beaten into submission by the wokies and the anti-theists.
come for the gaming culture  stay for the Bible verses. boom!
I used to hate religion like a decade ago  but people like jordan peterson  sam harris  eric weinstein  etc got me to see another side to it  so I appreciate you including it and explaining how it is relevant to the conversation.
you do things different from other channels!  argh  religion! gee  why do people feel like everything s all cookie-cutter
the comments about the religious content are hilarious  why bother even wasting the time guy  now religion isn t my cup of tea by any means  I was sort of  forced  into it as a child  traditional roman catholic family  for awhile but my old man relented since he was more interested in chasing deals at tag sales   flea markets on sunday mornings. thatsaid  his younger brother my uncle  got his life together  and became an ordained minister priest for some new age Christian denomination like 20ish years ago  born-again in some capacity.he really was pushing for everyone to get on that train when that happened. I entertained him for awhile  read the old new testaments in their entirety  discussed stuff with him etc. when I was in hs  but that ultimately was like the final nail in the coffin for me  that and several games I d played books I d read  off the top of my head ff tactics   xenogears come to mind . haven t had a good relationship with him since I last saw him like 15 years ago. I wouldn t say that he s  dead to me  but he just doesnt exist in my life at this point. honestly its kind of a shame because he used to be that cool uncle as a kid in the 90s. loved spending time with him back then before he went super religion. the problem is that every time he did come around after his conversion he d be incredibly pushy about his religion.as far as me  religion isn t my thing. do I respect it if someone else is into it  absolutely. just dont push it onto me. Im more or less against organized faith  not the absence of faith. in comparison to that guy s comment in the video  I just dont watch the verse of the day. thats my cue to leave the video  Im not gonna talk down on it or belittle someone for having that view. you do you. melonie seems to have a perspective that comes from the heart so I respect it. and I love the rest of the commentary that the videos bring.oh yeah. I just remembered a funny story. back when I was in hs a friend of mine was dating a super religious girl. she wanted him to go to a service at their church and he asked me to come along as backup... it was one of those churches where they did the thing and the people started freaking out and acting wild when they got touched on the forehead. we both looked at each other like  we gotta go. now.
people complained about tifa having smaller breasts and calling it censoring aren t actual final fantasy viI fans  because if they were  then they would know that tifa s actual design isn t remotely new  it is the design that was finalized in the movie final fantasy advent children released in 2006  and in said movie  tifa had much smaller breasts  and the movie s creators explicitely explained why in an interview  it was both for practical purposes as animating her huge breasts jiggle during the fights would have a hard task  and also  and more important  because of aesthetic concerns  having a woman with huge breasts fighting and jumping around is aesthetically ugly  it looks bad and it looks weird.and if you look at the characters designs in the movie  you ll see that in every single iteration of these characters in games or various works featuring them after the movie  they were always featured with the ac movie design  and not the ff7 game one  in short  squareenix used in ff7 remake the character designs that were made final  ironically  not by ff7 itself  but by its first actual sequel  the movie final fantasy advent children.so in conclusion  no  in no case  at all  was tifa censored  yes  her breast size was reduced  but this decision has been made with only aesthetism concerns in mind.also  for the morons who still believe  despite all the evidence that tifa was  censored   canthen they explain why scarlett is shown with even bigger breasts and a deep cleavage  and being extremely sexualized then  bar her presence at the shinra meeting  scarlett wasn t present at all in the entire midgar section in the original game  which means her presence  and thus  her large amount of sexualization was a conscious addition to the game.
good luck on elden ring.
ever notice that  just like how there is no difference between a wokey and a racist  there is really no difference between a wokey and an ultra-conservative southern Bible belt thumping preacher
they dont care about unrealistic representations in p0rn... only in general generally male dominated hobbies.
like slavery
@benny pika slavery is ubiquitous and predates all known civilizations.
@vegetta00  not really no. only slave culture would say such things. you wont find any slavery in any country that doesnt have religion  period. scientist living in antarctica are political anarchy and they are an civilization that isn t interest in having slave.
@benny pika  I dont understand what youre trying to say.
thats ok  thank you so much for getting me to round 2!
I never understood the tifa backlash either. she went from very stylized in the original to semi-realistic in the remake. that plus a sports bra equals a smaller looking chest. she s still a spicy italian meatball.
wow  they re rehashing a 2019 article in 2022. forget  slow news day   they have slow news years.
the world would be a better place if the smallest size was a d-cup...
I could be wrong but was that from your first video about the religious guy on twitter cos it was the quartering that give you a shout out is why Im here
journals are running out of real video game article
come on! shes a c cup max!
must be so nice to be a remotely attractive girl with make up on ...the growth on this channel in so little time ...must be nice ...
did it not actually tell anyone how to measure  like  the difference in rib cage vs bust equals cup size. itseems very unhelpful if it didn t.
aww shit  here we go again
just bought some more sour demon ade thanks
tifa has just barely recovered after that italian senate debacle  leave the poor gal alone journos
sigh getting used to being called a boomer is tough
congrats!
woo! 1 month!!
just downloaded the new nude tifa and jessie mods
I ll do anything for you....except give you up!!!booooom!!!!!
some people have too much time on their hands  who cares what size tifa is.
let s face it  next to chicken wings- boobs are God s greatest invention. just a fact.
I too  as a gamer  talk about bra sizes. they have been becoming smaller and smaller  and thats a problem.
commenting to feed the algorithm ...  ...  ...  and for thatspecial treatment some people need.
I spent 13 years building my platforms l  stay mad lol
@melonie mac go boom  was being sarcastic. the account gained followers and views pretty high   pretty fast. seemed sus that is all.
ahh thank you so much!
that wasnt tifa lol  it was a random 3d model made to look like her  if square enix didnt make it its not her
coomer
4k texture resolution
whats the name of the song at the end
hmm  video game g cups are really... unrealistic in that case cause she is kinda tiny to be a g cup. I say this from lived experience.
these folks seem waaay to interested in fictional booba..
video games journalist are not to be taken seriously anymore. seeing as though they are more or less activist now. who dont actually play video games. lol
mk11 did sonya blade so dirty its horrible. honestly they did everybody dirty in that game lol
what do you think of the lara croft skin in fortnite
that comment about religion. I just have to shake my head. I personally am not religious. grew up going to church  as a grew up decided it wasnt for me. that being said  does you having a verse or whatever at the end bother me  no. is it why I watch you videos  no. but I came here to your channel. complaining about it would be like going over to another persons house and being like  hey why you do that thing you do in your house thats yours  I dont like that! stop it!  which like sure if they were eating someone alive  it d be a valid point. but thats a whole other discussion. anyway....basically you do you. as long as youre not eating people. or at the very least please dont eat me.
there wwas or use to be a guild named  angry vag  in black desert online
not exactly sure what the purpose of this article is really  like for the people that thought tifa was a b-cup.... really      and for the article itself   uh ok    fictional characters have exaggerated features   look at lara  prince adam etc etc   if youre seeking out total realism in fiction   seek non-fiction I guess    what a world we live in
onward and upward! boooooooom!  d
watch the digital foundry videos on elden ring.   currently  the best way to play it is the ps4 pro version on a ps5.  it is laughable the things they are seeing on a pc  xbox one  series x and their combinations.
lol thats the best they can say  that women who dont agree and want feminine and strong female characters are  pick me  types. how about the fact that its possible that you like em just as much as straight men do.
I think Im hearing a bit of a southern accent.
this verse of the day remind me another verse I dont remmeber the propper verse but goes something like  when you are tempted  dont say God is tempting you didnt you said created this channel to be separated from the exclusively gaming channel  yet with that  warning  ppl dont have enough brain cells to undestand nobody is forcing them to watch the channelImean  I say it bfore and say it again  I didnt knew who you are before like 2 maybe 3 months ago  maybe I hear way before about you because the quartering shoutout but didnt follow to your content  then a month ago I see a random tweet saying  suscribe to my new channel I dont have contnet yet  and got me like  why not I never expect that  why not  was the most satisfying and blessed  why not  I ever made  I found a smart  beautiful woman who wont take crap from wierdos and also know and preach Jesus as her savior and radiates God s lovealso because of your verse of the day I have started to read again my Bible and searching Christians preachs to rekindle my faithJesus loves you miss mac and he bless you
eh  Im not much on the Bible stuff  but there s a lovely little x button in the top corner for a reason.  or on the tab itself  in my case . dont like that part of things   x  solves all. but I enjoy the rest of it  so I ll watch that just fine.  shrug
naw they nerfed her
k after g fuel can I get buy some go boom merch
kallie is far left  wants a new lara croft game where she comes out as lesbian.
these people didn t watch ff7 advent children a bit late to comment on tifa.
its not that they are mad thatshe had a small chest its that the feminist game director had the bigger size she had reduced b4 reveal...
@darkshadows123  I can hear the reeees already in the distance.

not to sound like a... ...but Imuch prefer the smaller cup sizes. like the g was just gross looking and the mortal combat ones were nicer.
I have no problem with tifas body measurements  but honestly for a sporty athletic girl I would prefer... guilty gear strive s jack-0 body type. or pole jumping italian athletes type  men of culture know.ps  dont come with  if you dont love x  then you hate x  bu11ch17 kid logic fallacy
nice dog tho
my brother says....bigger is almost always better.hmm...I dunno....but my brother knows  a lot....stuff and shijt   sooo....yeah.
already up to 26.5 subs wtg
this is how gaming dies. with petty virtue signaling.
if you take issue with the Bible verses  you are free to end the video there. Imean they seem to come up at the end video anyway  so as my old pastor used to say   if you dont like it  turn the knob.
big booba or bust.
read my word every day. cant live on bread alone. daily manna
why Bible no Bible  lol the way you say  Bible  I lost it
re-normalize female video game characters with anything above b cups.
tip for the guy who dont want to listen to Bible verses. stop watching at that point like I do. omg so hard I know but I know you can do it
what cup size r u melo
beep
yeah  dont remind me
huzzah!
anyone commenting on the bra size of game characters is either a game journo with nothing of substance to say  or a thirteen year old boy.
1 view  8 upvotes  2 comments... nothing here  the heck  youtube
this is gotta stop
yeah thats totally cool too. my issue is when they change a character s size in the name of wokeness  but characters who were created smaller are just as awesome and look gorgeous
starting at about 09 58 in this video   what a shame that commenter  is forced at gunpoint to watch this channel...
lol
I had a comment but then I lost it
they kind of made all the mk girls look like shit honestly lol its pretty bad. I d take deception alternate mileena over any of these new chicks with better graphics  who somehow look worse lol
as a straight white male where do I go to blame society or the world for my own failings and shortcomings
first   foremost  mk 11 sucksyeah  I said it dont censor me   dont take my words out of context as a old school veteran fan of mk  what those 3 soyboys steve beran  daanish syed   brendan george did to those femme fatales of mk 11  its sexist  its wrong   its not righted boon never should ve listened   bent the knee to demented feminists on twitter that dont buy any of these games
the sexism in video games  movement  has always obsessed over women being objectified. meanwhile... let s pay no mind at all to the countless tall  handsome  muscle-bound  impossibly jacked male stereotypes who star in the majority of games ever made. they re fuckin video games. who cares.
tifa cant and shouldn t be muscular
um....why is this a gaming article  dont game journalist have better things to write about  like the intelevision amico maybe
how dare you whamen have big busts.this world is insane.
she talks like she s talking to men.men who dont give a shit about garment details  its a fun guessing game though .
Imean if they dont want to listen to the Bible verse stuff...then simply stop watching at that point. like get over yourself. lol
why does this article even exist  looks like someone over at gamespot forgot to take their meds.
its not just control its hierarchy. communists and the communist-adjacent have to assert dominance over all culture especially when they are not welcome.
booooooommmmm!!!!!!0 37 secs... kitteh!!!and the rest... booooooooooobbbiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
all cups sizes are equal in the eyes in this man s eyes lol.  also the this person that doesnt like you saying Bible related stuff   has some deep problems   lets pray for this troubled soul.
says doesnt have a problem with religious people but then is bothered by a Bible quote at the end of the video.you canthrow the bath water without the baby.
also  sorry to spam you  the redesign called for major updates in the anatomy for every single character  you cant make them look like this and keep the cartoony proportions the other characters have  they were more like anime characters  I do find it odd that they try their best oto cover her up  why thou    its not any more outrageous than some women like to wear now  if anything they just highligthed and made it a problem themselves    we need to cover girl girls cant show skin  its stupid and puritanical
is this channel about gaming culture  or going boom  dont get me wrong  I dont have a problem with people going boom. but if I wanted to be going boom  I would go boom. when you sneak in go boom  I feel betrayed by you.
as an atheist  I can confirm your videos have very low religious content.you should make some religious videos if you want. as an atheist I respectfuly wont watch it  but would watch your other videos. I do the same with prageru  jordan peterson and others  I watch most of their videos but skip their religious ones. everyone deserves their freedom of speech and religion lack.
agreed especially in the case of skarlet whose powers only work properly if she s half naked.
that is a yes
stop tempting us with ur beauty
how is it not misogyny to hate womens shapes
I spent years fighting to break away from forced exposure to Christianity.  indeed I do not want it in my entertainment. good bye....
Im so glad asian game developers exist because they dont care about all that western cancel culture and woke shit. I cant remember last time we had an original femme fatale character from western developers. just look at the mortal kombat games every new installment female character look more and more like man. and just wait for mk 12 every female character will be transexual man actually.
to all the atheists in the comments  God loves you  come home...
I like the channel and the content except for the Bible quotes....
so many have the agree with me or you are racist lol
Im an atheist  so not interested in Bible verses  but traumatized  really  lol. come on man.  d
the epitome of a nothing burger. I ll never take activist  game journos seriously ever again.
its funny how butthurt people get as soon as you even hint at your faith. like  fine  if you dont like it  deal with it. its not like she s knocking on your door trying to sell you a Bible. are youreally that insecure about your position
they call u what they are  offensive vs defensive
