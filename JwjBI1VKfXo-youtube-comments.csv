the irony of people complaining about  sexism  and  privilege   being the ones that always fail upwards. if a random guy caused this much damage to a company reputation  not only he would be fired on the spot  his career in entertainment would be dead. heck  people got fired because they posted something conservative or some edgy joke on their personal social midia and thatsomehow damages the company reputation.
frosk ruined g4tv s reputation when she went on that tirade which costs individuals their careers. she obviously feels no remorse for what she s managed to accomplish. which was destroy an entire company. lol
frosk is doing a hell of a job of debunking the angry lesbian trope.
for me  its not just the hate  the anger and the preaching of nonsense that bothers me. its the hypocrisy  the fact that these sorts of people claim to be tolerant  inclusive and  on the side of love.probably not the right thing to focus on but good Lord such unabashed hypocrisy annoys me to no end.
when someone shows you who they are  believe them. Ive been burned too many times to give people too many chances. there are alot more good people I can invest my time in  instead of wasting it on people like frosk  who doesnt seem like much of a joy to be around to begin with. they need to realize that if they act a certain way  then they are going to have a very lonely life.
its sad hear how many got laid off at g4 this week  my prayers go out to all those affected.
unfortunately melonie some people are just to far gone. I d like to think something like this would humble a person  but I guess in frosk s case it didn t work.
you were the only one I follow that gave frosk a fair shake. itstood out. this backhand slap to her colleagues was callous and deserves a change in perspective. at some point  the profit-hungry suits we used to hate will be back in charge and a wb discovery-like purge of activists will follow
oh man Im so happy that you made a video on this. I was eager to see your take on how awful she is.
frosk probably assumed correctly there was no reputation to lose anymore.
g4 is afraid to fire her because she made herself the public victim in the company. they are afraid of the backlash from her supporters. they decided to fire the 30 or so people who never had problem showing up day in and day out to get a check for their families who were not public figures. I hope they find a job quickly.
g4 should have hired melonie mac instead of frost urine. melonie is nice on the eyes for everyone  she knows what she s talking about  she s a real gamer  she the perfect package honestly.if they had hired melonie mac g4 would be successful today making bank.frost urine is a stage 4 cancer mixed with aids and c19 all into one.
her and adam are the sole reasons why I refuse to watch that network. her opinions of the base dont impact me in the least  but the fact that the network propped it up and stood with her  only to do a complete 180 a few weeks later with amouranth  and other situations. nope. adam being a toxic troll on twitter and other socials against people he disagrees with politically  nope. g4 is refusing to see the issues. we are literally telling them what the problem is and they refuse to correct it. I assume its out of fear of the backlash by the  small minority thatstill watches it. well  we already walked away  and they aren t really trying to get us back.
you were easily the most restrained when frosk had that rant earlier this year that I can recall. I know chrissie mayr and the fnt crowd were brutal towards her. I cant even imagine how mad those folks that got laid off must be at her  too. how big of a narcissist is frosk that her first thought is to celebrate when her coworkers are having to look for new jobs
its sad when there are people that we look up to end up doing something terrible. and I feel bad for those who got laid-off. I hope they y all find work soon. lately Ive been getting a lot of bots following me. which is weird. good video. have a good day melonie.
enjoying the uploads  thats freaking harsh celebrating something like that in a public way like that  hope you are well mate  God bless melanie mac
the problem with frosk is thatshe has been given too many passes on her behavior. her attitude reflects that of a person who s never really had to deal with anything  especially the windfall of her own behavior.
Imistakenly thought her name was frost because she would always give me a cold shoulder every time I see her on screen. ironic isn t it.
in other words g4 fired every one except the one person they should have from the start....and now the original problem is still wreaking havok I could not be less surprised if I tried.anyone still apologizing for her inexcusable behavior has  serious issues  that need to be addressed in therapy....
frosk should consider that maybe the problem isn t sexism in gaming  or harassment  bullying  or any of that. maybe the problem is thatshe has a nasty attitude. she probably wont. but she should.
people have been ousted and blacklisted for far less. I 100  agree with you.
oh  that guy would have to enter some kind of witness protection program.
exactly  see kathleen kennedy and the entire star wars brand she has run into the ground.
I was going to post this but you did a better job. frosk complains about sexism yet shes only kept her job because of sexism.
I wish I could fail upwards I would be worth billions
remember when the tripewire ceo got fired because he said he was proud of the supreme court decision to overturn rvw
guys cantake it    we are stronk! lol
still have to blame the company for allowing her to do it
@sam beezy  then they still keep her on as they let others go for her mistakes as long as she is there the company will never rise again  will never recover.they ll only keep on falling until its dissolved completely.
@dog serious  before creation  comes destruction. let the company die so something new can rise from the ashes.
what she did cost her own career  how the company reacted to it cost a bunch of people their jobs  the only careers damaged are those who were actively involved the people fired recently lost their jobs not their careers
g4tv destroyed their own reputation by not firing her after her very first tirade. they chose to go with the activist route and said  stunning and brave  and now all of g4tv is paying the price.get woke  go broke
I highly doubt a handful of offended male audience would have made the monetary difference in the end. the parent company spent 100 s of thousand before they knew what they wanted. now when they are somewhat successful  again the money is running out .a full studio is not cheap and those heads of departments really need to bring in millions per month to even stay afloat with california expenses. its expecting too much from what is a humble beginning with a rebrand slapped onto it . adam said some weird stuff but that is expected and kevin always trash talked the show in jest . the title of the video is accurate in that frosk works for g4   frosk made an inconsiderate meme post   frosk gets the bad consequences  then g4 as a side hit. it doesnt cover the monetary losses in studio costs and personnel. calling out actual misogyny in comments and live chat is where itshould have ended. move on   let the moderators handle it . still dont think g4 is dead because of frosk . I honestly believe g4 is dead because its too corporate too large a space for basic content creation  regular warehouse would be fine    too by the numbers cookie cutter content as the main attractions    inconsistent  uploads  staff  timing   live chat  platform . it barely resembles attack of the show prior. there are more gamers than ever but they cant seem to find an audience . hmmmm...
of course she feels no remorse  in fact its a victory for her  she doesnt like gamers and gaming and the reason why she s in the industry pretending to like games its because she wants to destroy it. that what activists do  they pretend to like something they dont like  to infiltrate it and destroy it.
those loud seal claps from psychotic adam sessler and mr chobot had a lot to do with the fans abandoning the channel.
@dog serious  a
her tirade single handedly killed red dead redemption online.
@tobI won kanogy
@cody games  maybe  but gta6 are using her likeness in a cartoon character that they ve released  so she will get royalty payments from that. but there s no way Im buying that.
@dog serious  why would they do that   she said herself she doesnt play most of the games she just reads a script or whatever.
everything she said was true. there s a reason why lobbies dont exist on games anymore. the 360 and ps3 all used to come with mics you didn t need party chat to speak to someone. it was fun and toxic. you cant do that anymore unless youre playing cod on xbox or ps nobody really speaks
jordan peterson has talked repeatedly about how people who preach their virtues are anything but.
hmm
the thing is frosk is barely a gamer in the first place. she literally only plays lol and a few other games and she literally didn t even know mass effect was multiplatform.maybe we need to change who we call a gamer lol
those who speak the loudest have the most to hide
agreed!
I hear this  but I also agree with mel on her point to at least try to give someone the benefit of the doubt. did I appreciate frosk s initial rant about alleged misogyny  no. but  now that frosk is doubling down  she can eff off.
prayers
@ken sheldon  prayers.
I feel really bad for those folks I just hope they all find something quickly
@ken sheldon  do you also rant to people who say God bless after you sneeze  you know even some atheist say prayers or blessings as a means to convey sympathy or support right  its just a nice meant way to convey something calm down dont be a frosk.
its very likely that those laid off have the same toxic worldview as frosk. they dont deserve your sympathy.
how sweet of you
fools tend to be galvanized rather than humbled.
fair shake  benefit of the doubt isnt the same thing as a far shake. the latter would be determined by look across her history and making a determination based on that  which is what I would say most of her critics did. the former is turning a blind eye to their misdeeds because you want to believe they are a good person. something she is clearly not based on her history.
yep if any youtuber had a take we needed to hear its mel s
you can always go lower.
@Christian gonz lez  sadly  for extremists like her  losing reputation among normal people actually increases her reputation among fellow extremists.
@ninjagold  but those extremists are losing power in entertainment currently. and when it gets to the point that very few places want to deal with them she will be in a grave she dug herself.extremism is funny like that. easy to get praise and recognition in  but when the outside world has had enough of its nonsense you suddenly find yourself in very small  and quickly shrinking box
they done f  ked up!
frosk is pretty cute.
it certainly would have been an improvement  but g4 was doomed either way. they were spending ridiculous amounts of money on production  had far too many employees for what was essentially a glorified youtube channel. even a fairly successful yt channel cant support more than a few people working fulltime. unless youre pewdiepie youre not going to make enough ad revenue off of one channel to support 30  people  the economics just wont work.the main problem with g4 is that they were stuck in 90 s 00 s cable tv thinking in an age of youtube and streaming content. they revived a mammoth only to discover exactly why thatspecies went extinct to begin with.
@john smith  she has busted teeth and thats just one aspect of many things wrong with that head.
facts.
@the white mat studio  gives her character. she s quite lovely when she s not snarling.
adam has been part of many sinking ships its hilarious at this point.
@jim vasquez  he s a pirate  he jumps on another ship  attacks people  the ship begins to sink and he hops on another.
I will have to watch mac vid
I think I am getting them same bots stephen.
look up to someone in your real life  never someone on tv youtube social media
100  ironic
Imean  those things can definitely be problems in any hobby  not just gaming. but frosk seems to be angry on a deeper level and takes it out on anyone and everyone around her.
frosk killed the relaunched g4tv and then coyly celebrates thatshe haven t been fired  what a rolemodel.
I really enjoy your input towards everything. you do it in a way that is what God would will. you try to see the best in people  and even if they re the worst of them all  youre not brutal. youre just straight to the point  showing how they could do better. we re all blessed to have you mel.
you rock girl keep doing what youre doing the world is sorely in need of truly open minded people
the key is to realize thatsock puppet accounts are easy and often when they think its a lot of people with bad comments it could be only a handful and when you paint your entire customer base as bad its not a great move.  also realize that activist could easily be some of these bad comments because they want to push their agenda.
I swear to God if melonI would gather a group of well-versed people who love all type of video games first person shooter  action adventure  rpg  and more and did reviews it would skyrocket of the face of the earth
exactly mel ! we need to say this over and over....twitter means nothing ! retweets are meaningless and listening to what goes on in social media is a fool s endeavor for any company trying to sell a product  movie  software   game or tv show.  you cant only listen to twitter for your opinion on a social or political topic.
Im sorry that your view on frost has been hurt. its hard to see folks you look up to fall so low. as for frost s actions here they are tone deaf and childish. she may hate her critics but celebrating when your coworkers were let go is a garbage move to do. even if she didn t intend it that way  the fact she has zero self awareness about her actions is why I find her so repugnant. because her rant  I will admit there was a grain of truth in that if she wanted to discuss sexism in gaming and was being good faith about it  cool. but she had an attitude and also said many things that weren t true. and that definitely didn t help g4. they got their dopamine hit but in the long run it left the company hollow and empty.
loved how the rant about the philosophy of game developers and the industry became the most significant part about the video and not so much about  frosk. great video you seem like youre actually passionate about this and not just jumping on a trend.
I came out of mild interest in this frosk drama  but stayed for your evisceration of modern game nerfing. I really thought I was the only one annoyed with how flimsy  guided  and  safe  most modern games are.
if I wanted a walking simulator that held my hand for 5 hrs I d watch a movie or binge a tv show.
when I was in my teens twenties I loved nothing more than playing difficult video games that took me 20 30  hours to complete. I would love to do that again if I had the time and the skills that I used to. its a shame whats happening to games now.
frosk saying  I survived  and other tone-deaf yahoo on twitter upon not getting laid off when others did says a lot about her character
melonie ... I know you want to see the good in ppl 1st . I was the same   untill a certain incident   I realized the general default to ppl isnt good or bad its nutral   meaning the ones that become evil are evil they only play at being nice and frosk is the type that will demand you save her but if it were you she would step over your corpse without a second thought ... look it is ok to call out evil when its there it doesnt say less of you itsays more of you to call a spade a spade.
this is a two fold problem. frosk is celebrating still being there and laughing in the faces of the people thatshe helped get fired. and she still has a job with a company mere hours after saying all corporations are bad. like dude  you work for one.the wrong people are getting exiled from this industry. I swear.
on one hand itsucks to hear when people lose their jobs . but on the other hand  I cant help but remember hearing a lot of those employees clapping their hands like seals during frosk s rant so if those ppl got fired I dont exactly feel bad that they got fired.
I agree with you about retro and modern games. the puzzles in the older tomb raider games and the first silent hill game where some of the hardest puzzles I have come across. in the modern tomb raider games  the so called puzzles are not really puzzles  but just things that you do to advance in the game. I still had fun with them to some extent  but the gameplay just doesnt compare to the older tomb raider games.
I was so excited for g4 to come back  then I heard that rant  like many others  live. call me crazy  but I dont like being grouped in with people that are doing bad things when I would never partake in them myself. I haven t tuned in since then and kind of forgot g4 existed again.
they went so full in on protecting frosk  and agreeing with her message that they couldn t fire her  otherwise they d be hypocrits  and or would have the cancel crowd come after them
it is easier to be hated than to be respected. some people chose to be lazy and push people to hate them  rather than put in the effort to be good at something and earn respect. frosk has chosen to be the villain of the games industry  and the best weapon against people like that is indifference. talk about them as little as possible  ignore their tantrums  and let them fade away into obscurity.
thanks for the content. and thanks for not being afraid of the inevitable backlash you will u undoubtedly will have to deal with  for pointing out facts and saying your opinion of those facts.  unfortunately the  woke  narrative of our society has been portrayed in a way where anyone who speaks against any part of that narrative  tends to be attacked
and this is why no other person should be held accountable or responsible for the acts of other individuals.  if real and factual harassment exists  seek to use the laws we have and get proper accountability on the individual.  no other person connected by category membership to an individual who performs wrong action is accountable or responsible for that wrong action because of that membership.
its just a lot to invest. even when funhaus brought back inside gaming news or whatever it was called they had some issues with overhead. it would be cool though.
rpgs need a story though.  thats what makes rpgs what they are. people dont play d d pc games husr for the game play. if you think so then you have never played pen and paper rpgs before.
@evacody124  what  when did I say anything about rpg not needing a story
this is why I dont play kojima made games. if I was there for dialogue and cut scenes  I would just watch a movie.
feels intentional at this point. it is like they want the  blue haired wokeys  in numbers  hoping that one day they see roi.
@charlotte andor  alas  that day likely wont come. then what.
I left the games industry and at this point Imay never go back.
@tacotone  preach.
fun fact  in the first of the newer tomb raider games  no women die.
itseems like back then they had to focus more on the gameplay because the systems were simpler. the visuals could not be a priority.
yup. or she cantry and sue them
also firing her is not going to bring people back to g4. that bridge is already burned. she is kept on to keep the very small minority of people thatstill watch the show. its inevitable that g4 will completely collapse though with her included.
its also way too late to attract back the fans they lost over this.  so firing her wouldn t gain them anything and would most likely turn away the few fans thatstuck around.better off burying it like they have by privating the video in question and deleting the tweet supporting her  like they have done.  and moving forward hoping to attract new fans that never heard of the controversy.
I completely agree. never give the benefit of the doubt to people who hate you. the fact is  they dont think like you do. thats why you ll always find yourself thinking  I would never do or say that . too many people have a normalcy bias. Im sympathetic to that. I can definitely understand why that is  but people need to start training themselves to get rid of that. if you guys want games to be made for you  the actual gamers   you have to start giving them compelling reasons to do so. at this point  there is no way to even compromise within the gaming sphere  and many other aspects of life . they ve been catering to the woke side  because the compelling reasons they gave  are things like threats of violence  internal sabotage  bad reviews by leftist game journalists  etc. personally  I cant call myself gamer  but I love games. a lot of gamers Ive known or met were cool. or at least  what I consider to be cool. Im not suggesting threats of violence or anything like that. Im saying  stop being so nice. stop being such push-overs. you guys are gamers  strategy and planning isn t lacking here. when if you guys push back  there shouldn t be any half measures. hit them in the pocketbook  so to speak  in an organized manner  and keep the pressure the on  even in the face of journalists calling you names and the woke doing what they do. be clear about what you want. the way I see it  this is far more important than just saving a fun hobby. this is about culture  and the woke are well aware of this. thats why they dont give a s... about gaming  yet they ve inserted themselves by force  from behind  into the gaming industry  against the will of actual gamers  you . there s a word for that  isn t there
g4 s draw  for me at least  was watching pretty girls talk about stuff I like.  it was a simple enough concept.  then they do a complete 180 and allow frosk to continue working there.  all they would have had to do is have a producer come out in the middle of her rant  say something like  hey  those values are not something we share.  youre fired.  and their ratings would have skyrocketed.  by letting her keep working there after that  they imply their support of everything she said.  and now they double down by not including her in the lay-offs.  as of now  there s only one cute gamer girl I watch  and thats plenty.
i..... completely agree with you in regards to modern gaming  vs compelling games made many  years back  ps1  etc .  very well stated and 100  accurate in my opinion.
she is awful. she s either too emotionally dumb to understand the effect her tweets have on her ex co-workers  or she actually enjoys the fact that they re going through all this mainly due to her takes and actions. its disgusting!
I started watching techtv in college and then continued as it was rebranded eventually becoming g4.  there was a time in my life when g4 and mtv were a major point in my life and I was pretty bummed out when it was finally taken away.  when g4 was originally announced to return  I had pretty grim hope that it would even be a shell of its former self.  but knowing a couple of my favorite former hosts  sessler and pereira  were going to be back as well ...that was great!  I d had to stop following the ses on twitter  as he was turning into a psycho  but I still held his gaming opinion pretty high.  unfortunately  I was right.  it was utter trash and then the whole frost rant  which I had long since stopped watching at that point  was the icing on the cake.  Imean  even blair herter turned into a weasel !
would you still play this game without the cutscenes  just brilliant. thank you.
first time seeing a video here  and youre observation on gameplay vs  pretty cutscenes  is 1000  correct.subscribed.
at the 8 00 mark  youreminded me of some of the older blizzard devs. I saw a few interviews about d2  w2  w3  and sc bw and everyone kept saying  we were just trying to make a fun game over and over and it was a such a huge contrast to everything their reps say now adays.
isn t frosk s spouse upper management at g4  I thought I saw thatsome where. I really stopped watching the g4 stuff. but decided to watch this since apparently she was at it again. but yeah  frosk and adam are the major reasons as to why g4 is going under now.
the original tomb raider game on ps1 was the ultimate for me. the adventure  the puzzles  the action. I used to dream about it  I d go to work thinking about how I could solve the puzzle I was stuck on. I d talk to my friends about it  we d comment on different weapons and map areas. I still love games now  but nothing ever came close to the experience of that old ps1 game.
damn it. g4 was my og growing up. all the way back to it being x-play and techtv  an even further back  so this whole thing kinda breaks my heart. I was so excited when they came back but immediately felt a tonal shift but just passed it off as maybe Im just older or times being different. it only got worse. after this fiasco I have swore off anything to do with them  not even giving them clicks or views on any of their content
the host melonie made a ot of interesting points. this was actually good. the g4 revival was not made for the hardcore gamers. it was evident when they made that frosk girl the host of xplay. the show I so adored growing up. I knew I had a bad feeling the minute they show who was co hosting with sess. w the news that g4 went under again  Im actually cool with it. keep it for what us hardcore gamers remember it as  a place where they reviewed hardcore games.
she was like  dont like it  dont watch it  and we obliged. now  tons of people get fired because of her and she s all  lol  I survived  they didn t .
Ive never heard anybody seperate real gamers from pansy activists like this and I love you for it. you know my gamer heart!
you dont give humans like frosk the benefit of the doubt.
as an aspiring game dev  on the games are movies tangent . Im taking notes.   thank you
I ll put it this way  frosk is to g4tv  what ethan klein is to podcasting. there comes a point where you have to say   you know what  the ship is sinking. Ive tried to help bail out the water this ship has taken on. this ship is no longer worth saving. Im out. peace. frosk chose her rant as the hill to die on  and didn t evidently know that  go woke get broke  was a thing. now g4tv knows this painfully  and I hope they learned their lesson about frosk  which is to never let someone insert personal politics into a sphere like what g4tv originally was involved in.edit  quick question  is it me  or did a lot of this  go woke get broke  trend get started in video games when the last of us 2 came out  Im not talking about other industries or spheres here  Im talking video games and the gaming industry in general. because I seem to remember that a lot of that criticism that was aimed at naughty dog and neil druckmann back then was that he basically inserted politics into a video game story  and shouldn t have done it  as it ruined that franchise. am I wrong about when all of the backlash against politics in gaming started  because I cant think of any game or prior event to the last of us 2 that got as much political criticism and backlash as that game did.
frosk celebrating thatshe survived is like someone on the aft of the titanic as it breaks off and the bows sinks  then yells at the iceberg  I survived  bitch!  yeah  you did  but the remaining piece of the ship you on is still sinking.
man that was tone deaf ! if I were one of the shows people that got fired   I d be in her face letting her know this was her fault more than anyone else s. I d not be shy about it and maybe it d mean I never work in the industry again I d still feel the need to let her know she was the one and she needs to understand that it was her and nobody else that made the biggest mistake for the lack of success over the last year.  I couldn t let it go.  I know I d feel bad afterward and I know it isn t a very Christian thing to do but I couldn t hold back. and yah know if she had said anything to show remorse or even stayed neutral I d forgive her
I actually remember when frosk was cute normal female before she was infected with thatsocial contagion thats been destroying girls young women. Imight mock ppl like frosk  but deep down I do have a ton of empathy for them. but Im of the mind or  school  that mockery shaming can save lives. Ive seen it happen so many times its hard to deny.
g4tv was a big part of my life as well. that was the main way I used to watch e3 back in the day. like you I too had some hope and watched the whole thing on launch date .. but then the frosk thing happened .
can you give an example  Im curious.
@burza  well public shaming has historically been used as punishment for breaking less severe laws to correct the behavior. I believe studies have found it actually rather affective  more so than using pain if I remember the studies I read on it correctly.there are also the cases where using shame has had people change bad habits or poor life choices. like when someone overweight is shamed into losing the weight and getting healthy or a child starting to get into petty crimes or delinquent like behavior shame can correct these behavior.
@enuma elish  I feel like thats going to be a short term fix though  like contestants on the biggest loser usually gain it all back  and prison uh  doesnt seem to be working too well. real change needs to come from within. if they dont feel shame  they cant fully reflect  I think they ll just double down and everyone becomes worse off.
@gh0stgirl  the opposite is usually true. its those who are never taught to feel shame by being shamed that are the ones that double down. yes true change must come from within  but triggering that desire is what shaming is meant to do.prison is really just meant to be a last resort to get those who prove themselves harmful to society away from others.
mockery and shame are good ways to curve people  but I always believed in the good old saying   let them dig themselves into a hole.
the moment I saw frosk  and her oddly shaped hair  I knew this day was coming.  Im just saying  I just wasn t surprised by what she did.
its crazy to me that an employee who burns the company to the ground is allowed to stay while everyone else gets canned
they can either appease non-gaming lunatics  or their potential fanbase. which one of these do you think will help them to stay in business
you offered frosk the benefit of the doubt  and frosk offered g4 doubtful benefits.
I agree fully with the old games having much more challenging game play and cutscenes being a reward. a few examples I canthink of off the top of my head are the og final fantasy 7  silent hill series  the old resident evil games  1 through 4 specifically  ninja gaiden series  etc. its sad to see the direction videogames have gone. o also  games back then we re complete at release lmao.
the only reason she wasn t laid off is because they didn t want to deal with her crazy ass suing them
the only thing she cares about is saying f u to the fans. I love this. she is practically solely responsible  and they retained her. no f s given. I have fond memories of g4 before. this one can die. mildly amusing spectator fodder.
watching frosk destroy g4 is like watching a parasite invade its  host while completely destroying it from the inside.
absolutely  well said  the entire message
wow thank you youtube just showed me you  and youre awesome..... take out cut scenes and what s left... genious.... nailed it  its why I hate new games  great point
thank you. yes they are not real gamers. they are just activist seeing people have fun in a space they cant so they try to change it to match their viewpoint. and then never really invest in it after they ve changed it.
hey melanI its good to see a video from you for a weird reason yt is not showing your vids .now about frosk s issue she me have knowledge on the e-spor area but as gaming analist-host she does not  also she was fired from the commentary on e-sports for some takes but to use the victim card for not accepting she was wrong and what really pissed me off the completionist  sessller did not told her she was wrong   but went to the misogyny at fault. later she then tells half their comsumers in the usa  if they are right to eff off.and with that tweet all saw how she really is  and to be honest she still has a job because she s from the lgbt community and they would cancel the carcass of g4 that frosk and sessller destroyed.and in a way is a goal for frosk to burn a revive gaming channel with dumbs facts  alienating their viewers and spouting nonsense on twitter.
absolutely on point as always. older games actually challenged you - today its all about graphics  and those cut scene theatrics. little like rop or tros.  oh its such a beautiful game  .... if I wanted something beautiful id buy a painting  give me something that is challenging and compelling to play please
I wonder if frosk is going to be on friday night tights again this week
this is why she has been given the boot in her previous gigs... she doesnt care whether or not her actions have consequences that affect others. at the end of the day  its all about her. so Im not surprised thatshe did this. what will be interesting is whether or not she will be advised to take that tweet down.
frosk is obviously a angry and bitter person who has no joy in her sad life. hopefully she gets help for itsomeday. sucks for the g4tv staff members that lose their job because of her.
I was ready to discount this video until 6 05 at which point I realized that her point was spot on and well-stated.  glad I found this channel today.
I see their refusal to let her go as them doubling down on her rant. I used love old g4tv  their reviews kept me well informed. man  how times have changed for the worse.
she s not naive  she s doing it on purpose to get attention. and its working
I enjoyed the rant about how journalists complain that games are too hard or too long. they must really hate elden ring as its both difficult and long.
the  unforseen circumstances  are frosk s employment.
so refreshing to find an intelligent female online  so so so appreciate it  instant like and subscribe
I imagine that if g4 had hired melonie mac instead of frosk  g4 would be thriving right now.
forks already has information to blackmail. thats why despite being the reason g4tv has gone broke  they cannot fire her. better let the ship sink  fire innocents and let forks quit by herself than letting her release info.
I told my brother s that games were harder back in my day  ps2 .so I spun up an emulator and threw the spyro trilogy  james bond and sonic heroes at them.they got into the swing of things only after they accepted they needed to try.I also ran through sonic heroes for old times sake and I learned that 7 year old me had the reflexes of a fighter pilot.
I am beginning to believe this frost character has a personal relationship with one of the leading people.
melonie mac is such a classy lady. respect to this based individual
its like frosk couldn t wait to dump abby  zipper  emily  and all the other jabronis.
frosk is literally only there to browbeat the real gamers.
frosk may have done all of that. but let us not forget that many went along with it and even thought it was a good idea.
I respect that you want to give the benefit the doubt to people. thatsaid frost seems to be the type that takes advantage of people who do that like she s taking advantage of the people that pays her. I ll agree with her that men can be sexist and probably did judge her looks but if you do a good job and try to win people over most will change there minds. unfortunately she seemed to think trashing people was the way to get views for a gaming channel thatshe s on that if Im correct she said she doesnt play the games.
I rule the ruins!  -- queen frosk
6 20 a thing about those five hour gamers.  I take my time to experience a game.  explore every nook and cranny.  their possibilities.  then I watch youtubers to get ideas.  if you watch me game  you would fall asleep.
are we suprised that g4 would implode   melonie and you should watch cyberpunk  edge runners on netflix thoughts
how can g4 not realize frosk is one of the major problems  her pr killed any chance they had at a comeback.
my theory on frosk is that her main interaction with men on the internet was shittalking in games and assumed that was the only type of man on the internet. basically  she has a very shallow understanding of criticism  particularly if it comes from a man and refuses to understand how ignorant she is. not uncommon  but also not a reason why I should take her seriously.
she never even thought of us as human. her opinion meant as much to me as mine did to her 0 . stick and stones...
company buys g4  co. relaunch s g4  co. buys new studio for g4  g4 hires frosk to host  frosk lights match  frosk throws match  burns g4 to the ground  g4 lays off most of staff  frosk celebrates still having job  asteroid hits earth  frosk is sole surviving human  sexism in gaming finally solved!
g4 could always sue frosk for damages if she was liable for ruining the company s image
what makes frosk feel like she is better then everyone else
I wouldn t call myself a gamer  but Im glad I discovered this channel. I genuinely enjoy listening to what you think about various things. Im not going to pretend to not notice that youre beautiful and all thatstuff. you clearly are. your facial expressions are great as well. but its refreshing that youre actually intelligent and interesting  and dont simply go  Im pretty and cute  I dont need to have anything else . I appreciate that.
all we wanted was the original shows with the original hosts back. instead we get a mix  and the new crew is ruining it for everyone. I knew they were in trouble when they hired the woman that interviewed mike shinoda about linkin park  and had no idea that he was in linkin park. he had to tell her.
imagine getting fired from your job because 1 person there hurt the business so bad that 20-30 people lost their jobs and then seeing that 1 person gloat on twitter.
I know it will take time due to current culture  but I cant wait for karma to get frosk.
what a nice smokeshow I have stumbled upon here. great opinions all around!
frosk never knew her stuff. thats why she was getting backlash in the first place
she set a new speed-running record on corporate collapse simulator 2022.
keep on rockin  melonie. slava bogu.
thats been her attitude from the beginning though. that rudeness didn t just start recently  thats been her character from esports.
of course I assume you know the origin of the rant  right quick round up  she made some seriously unknowledgeable comments about microsoft owning bioware and sony fans got on her big time and said they wanted morgan and olivia back which lead to her rant.the funniest part is everyone was scared to correct her which could have prevented this from the start
I remember back in the day playing mgsI on ps1 and having no idea how to defeat psycho mantis  there was no internet or prompts. I found out the secret from a friend at school - -
look at the difference between frosk and kassem also at g4  one tweets glowing recommendations for some of the people laid off the other tweets about themselves
its really sad  it would have been easier if g4 just laid frosk off and hired a new host but idk maybe g4 is going through other troubles in the company
imagine melanie mac on the relaunch instead. I would have tuned in
I was already supportive of you when I saw the cara dune cut out in the back. the rest of the video was just icing on the cake
I knew it Im surrounded by assholes keep firing assholes  thats what Im thinking with g4 thats spaceballs quote
with great power comes...  all hell she backed over uncle ben in the toby and garfield spiderman.
anything with hints of agendas or activism  especially recently  I view askance or turn away from completely. cowboy bebop on netflix was a potent reminder to me as to why this stance should be maintained. loved the anime but Im never touching the live-action after the bad publicity which the main actress wasn t a minimal part of. as someone that grew up watching and liking g4  the only reason I knew they even still existed was because of the frosk rant  which made me write them off immediately. adam sesler really showed his ass too. just a matter of time before they re cannibalized by the very audience they are trying to capture which will fill me with a sense of ambivalence.
you know you can just walk in there and take over that job dont you
again  the g4 rant was not her first rant. so most people are counting this as  2 but this at least the 3rd big rant.also  the staff supported frosk. so to not even think before making this statement  about them  is just trashing them. I think the majority of people just quit watching g4 because the content was boring and outdated. the haters group and frosk fan group are probably about the same size  and neither of those are that big.
I d actually disagree. I think most people in general dont like frosk  there was a large dip after the sexism rant and they quickly spiraled down into a bad spot.now does this mean everyone is frothing at the mouth at the mention of her  no. but I d bet money that if you asked the average person that knew about her thought about her it would be a negative opinion.the only way I would think you would see otherwise is if you asked about her in an sjw leaning place.
@enuma elish  you may be right but  I think if it was just frosk and the show was any good people would of hate watched. kept messing with her in comments and chat etc. before they deleted their videos  you could see the trend. they had low views  the views shot up during the frosk rant stream because of the rant  then they tapered off back to where they were to begin with. if anything the rant helped their numbers in the short term.
first time I wanted your channel. you get it. one of us!  one of us!  subscribed.
its because she lacks 2 things  the goods   personality
I remember having to figure things out like in the og tomb raider it was frustrating and fun at the same time..
she is freaking insane
100  agree about the single player walking simulators. Imean  read a book or watch a movie. I love gameplay!
ultimately this was all bound to happen once gaming culture became more mainstream. people like frosk dont care about gaming as much as they care about the platforms gaming provides for them. you can see this all across the scene. it took frosk one week to destroy an the entire rebooted network with a rant filled with rhetoric from 2012   further proving thatshe knew nothing of the old network  twitch is currently battling all sorts of scandals  harassment cases and the fact that its bias towards softcore cam girls  who get seven day bans for fucking on stream  has been bursting at the seams for a while now. this is why its important for certain things to not only be kept underground  but to have gatekeepers who maintain the integrity of such spaces.
thats like walking into a cancer ward and bragging that you dont have cancer.
if g4 was serious  they would hire melonie mac to host content.
I thought frosk was mgk .oh shit! its actually a different person
what it boils down to is  if they fired frosk  they admit fault  and they are too egotistical to do that.
for those who think this is about sexism  ask yourself why frosk is so hated despite so many females in the industry or commentator space that isn t. melonie is loved  even if there are some trolls here and there.
yea I always hated cut scenes  I d always be saying  get back to the game already .
frosk had way more then a difference of an opinion. she went on a rant which destroyed the company she works for which caused dozens of employees to lose their jobs. she would be the first to trash someone elses  difference of opinion  and doesnt deserve anyones attention anymore.
I dont think she even realizes she s part of the problem if she is posting stuff like this.
I listened to the the first 30 seconds of this video.then I hitsubscribe. then I went through the rest of the upload  and I was not disappointed with my decision to subscribe.
I love your lighting and colour grading.
melonie mac thoughts on gamergate as a movement
Ive been telling everyone  the root cause of all the  wokeness   everywhere. look into  esg scoring for companies.  you get the full story.
I agree  with frosk. I probably would have let her go after the rant that happened.
celebrating keeping her job was completely insensitive to her 25-30 co-workers that got laid off.  thatsaid  she must have been in complete tunnel vision obsessed with the idea that  haters  were trying to get her fired.  it was an immature tweet and Im assuming at least some of the staff told her something to the effect of  dont be a douche      grow the hell up .  at least I hope so.
she is always insane
first!!!
how insane  like  ezra miller insane
I only hate cut scenes when you cant skip them. first time  ok  tell me the story. after that  I just want to lose to the boss again.
tbh when she gets fired laid off  its going to be an amazing uphill battle for her to find a new job in the sector. like what company is going to be like  this person practically blew up a multi-million dollar company in 1 video and a few other posts  lets hire her here.
tnx for the good content
Im only hal-joking  but at this point  the cost of hiring a hitman to whack frosk is lower than long-term financial cost of firing the very same frosk...
I hope zipper is okay...
her acting this way is why she still has the job  and she knows it. it keeps the people in power afraid of her. this is right out of the activist playbook. always on the offensive  with no regard for anything other than themselves.
the only thing I disagree with is the comment about cutscenes in video games... most of the casual gamers will always want to skip any cutscenes to go fast to the action with no interest at all towards the lore of the game. or they always want the gameplay to be fast pace  like call of duty  without no thinking  no boring cutscenes... im sure you know what im talking about but I do understand what you were thinking in your argument.   but very good video mac !!
only a matter of time before the whole channel folds and no other company will hire her
g4 is done.  her salting the ashes at this point cant hurt it.
its like all these companies got with advisement firms on how to build a new audience and the firms hired tumblr .now here we are with companies a complete mess with activists
mel is the best chick gamer ever I swear
I didn t even know g4 was still a thing  until frosk fucked it all up  again  so she brought some recognition back. go woke  go broke. true story
camera center on melonie     activist in gaming ...      people  cheers
the real irony is that anyone who looks up g4 knows what frosk says is complete asidine bs. the true hillarious part of all of frosks tangents is she is insulting her own boss  .  who facilitated a lot of gamer culture  .  and they want to go out and call it toxic. its like  bruh stop a moment and take a look at your self.  this is a serious case of failure to stop and self evaluate ones self before they wreck themselves.
lets be honest with her attitude had she been fired she would still be celebrating because in her mind she can do no wrong.
I had no real opinion on her until now. the rant was just another example among many of a company trying to push a narrative they think benefits them. didn t say anything to me about her personally. this  however says everything. thatshe cares more about poking the bear and dunking on the people frothing at the mouth over her embarrassing outburst than showing an ounce of humility or compassion when 30 or more of her coworkers just had their lives turned upside down thanks in part to something she played a large role in. speaks volumes to her character.
frosk and the general  better than though  activist attitude that g4 has had since their relaunch is definitely a big proponent in why they re not succeeding. the other part of it is simply that their shows and writing  frankly  suck. my brother and I grew up watching attack of the show and xplay and those jokes and skits are hilarious  even to today. some of them are even timeless and more relevant now than they were when they initially came out. g4 today  their jokes aren t funny  their skits are boring  and they completely miss what made the original shows successful. its a real shame  in this instance lightning doesnt strike in the same spot twice itseems.
g4tv  talk to em frosk! tell em why we re fired!
there are a lot of people in the entertainment industry who hate the fans. across multiple ips. reminds of the guy who runs a local gas station. he s bitter and hateful towards customers. no wonder the place across the street does significantly more business. maybe soon some of these companies will purge.
lara croft needs to save video games from people like the evil frosk. make that a game.
if one good thing came from frosk its mayr s parody of her.
...abc or disney sadly
bahaha yesss
she ll just keep goofing around and ruining g4 s reputation until its completely sunk  and then some other group will pick her up.
frosk has some ballsoh wait
I didn t realize g4 was still a thing I haven t watched itsince like 2009
they should hire you!
brass tacks  if g4 fired her  they could afford to hire everyone else back.
it begs the question though...why wasn t she laid off   how could any g4 suit  when choosing which among the staff will get the axe  possibly decide to keep her on
Im just listening to miss melonie here.  there are women that youreally just dont want to know.
chrissy mayer another chick I listen to she did a rap thing is she portrayed frosk real well
yes she is
7 00 thats how I felt with red dead 2. returned that after the first hour. loved the first one tho
great perspective on the current state of these fake   weak minded games journalists  and the current state of games  we get as a result of there review mentality. iIm a gen x gamer thats now trying to make my own games and bring back some of that good stuff that games seem to have lost . frosk is just another toxic woke cult member.
thank you melonie mac go boom boom   team
love you mel!
adam sessler is also responsible
heavy rain was an amazing game despite not having gameplay. there are some exceptions. people enjoy watching good stories
wait  g4tv has a reputation left to damage
you weren t wrong in giving them a chance it was just undeserved because some people have no remorse. so much for the more empathetic political side.
I was hoping you d do a video about this! lol!!!
you gotta go back beyond the ps1 when it comes to cutscenes  because back in my day during the 8-bit era we didnt have cut scenes  alot of games back then didnt even have stories  because the gameplay made up for it.... so modern games will never be on the same level as games were back in the 80s and 90s.
Im not sure frosk ever really knew what she was talking about. this started because of a horrifically ill informed take on ps vs xbox after all.
insert   adam sessler patronizing seal clap.
this is the first video of yours that I have seen. I do respect your opinion about giving people the benefit of the doubt and respecting others opinions. thats an admirable mentality to have. I do agree. however  when someone crosses a line in an egregious fashion the way her and adam sessler did  they deserve to be called out publicly and humiliated. people need to be held accountable for their actions. if they never learn the repercussions of their actions  they will never change. sometimes its not about respecting another person s opinion. sometimes  its actually about holding people accountable for their actions. she deserves all of the backlash she gets.
self absorbed  that is the mentality that perforates all the industries. so I am not surprised thatsomeone who seems to have no reason for humility would say what she did.
to be honest  I am glad they kept frosk. let her go down with the ship. I love the fact she is left behind in a dumpster fire. single handedly destroyed g4. I love it
you melonie   are hundred times more competent to do her job than her   without having to compare any physical atributes   you sound like a girl and that is awesome    frost sounds like your angry mum   the tone of her voice its annoying just alone   I just cant stand it .     I had a work colleague    she was what people  use to call tommy boy   lesbian with male attitude and we were mates   once established  the relation and knowing each other I used to go along really well   feel comfy with her   she worked really hard and I liked that   she had no time for whining around or complaining about silly things   sometimes when I see this type of things Imiss her      but  when I see frost I see an annoying person so selfish thatshe really dont deserve the attention  she constantly demands       if any other girl  in her position had spoken common sense  and respected the audience probably g4 still had a chance                                                                          peace
did people know frosk was diagnosed with  borderline personality disorder   it explains her self-destructive behavior. do you know who also has that very same diagnosis  amber heard!
frosk is a toxic individual who painted all gamers as the same and insulted us. she and g4 deserve what happens to them. g4 should never had hired her nor stood by her after her rant.
cant believe sarkisian lite is also successful
thats why I say cyberpunk 2077  is the most natural game because it reminds me of what games once were. you can even tell that cd projekt red cares about that title also. after halo infinite came out which is one game I loved before 343 took over they changed everything about it and its not the same. so I do agree activist have taken over way too much  and itsucks.
the games frosk plays are irl and cost other people.
well  her  I survived post didn t age well at all and fast.   she s gone from g4
frosk has balls of steel because she is protected because she is a woman.
when you mentioned walking simulator I instantly pictured last of us 2
well said tomb raider was hard as hell!
the 2 people who deserved to get fired the most are still there.... just because g4 is still moving dosnt mean it isn t dead.
hey melonie I just wanted to wish you to have wonderful weekend  thanksfor everything you do for your chanel.takecare melonie
wow youreally went into detail as to why I find games like tlou extremely overrated and why I love the souls games.
frosk looks like what would happen if a gelfling banged an elf she has elf ears and a gelfling face
you would think that frosk and adam sessler would be the first to go. kind of strange.
what one
I think that the new g4 was already ruined. frosk is just throwing gasoline on that dumpster fire. I would have fired her after thatself righteous temper tantrum thatshe threw. I dont know what things are like on the inside there but if this is her behavior then she could expose the network to a hostile workplace lawsuit. Ive seen this happen before.
I liked frosk more when he called himself machine gun kelly
always look down on people who are on tv youtube and have some notoriety. its ok. they look down on you.
firstly  what does game length have to do with you being a hardcore gamer or not . you are a tomb raider fan  you can beat the original game in 3 to 4 hrs. secondly  cutscenes are not rewards  it is way to exposit overall story to the  player.  going back to game lengths they have become longer or if not  give you multiple ways to end you game with minimal effort put in  like nier automata  where youre ask a question and depending on the response  roll credits. other  then that great video. keep up the good work.
frosk is g4tv now.
g4 had a reputation to ruin  g4 wont fire her because they re afraid of the aftermath of doing so.
she had a point somewhere in that rant  but she went overboard  and others there jumped onto her bandwagon.
talk to him frosk
Im just amazed thatshe can simultaneously destroy the company and blame everybody else for the layoffs she caused by destroying the company.also  take note that none of the people beating their own chests and making rants on social media about the ists and phobes got laid off. its all behind the scenes staff. people that did nothing to torpedo the show. none of the people that caused these firings offered to reduce their own paychecks to prevent said firings. all of them are happy that they still get to keep drawing pay while other people that were innocent in the problem got shafted.
poor foreskin hurtin   frosk hurin . she just cant get her hand off her  knob and turn down the volume.
does the razorfist thing to all the people defending frosk half a year or so ago. you know they say the strangest things when they think artist ally is not hearing them... the issue is they are loud as hell.
so  usually when companies layoff people to cut costs  they layoff people with the highest salaries. so  more than likely they aren t paying her a ton to be a personality for the shows  otherwise they would find a cheaper on air personality. this may not be 100  the case  but is a likely scenario. if this is the case. dont think she should flex for this reason and flexing on other people losing their jobs.
so she can spread her hate   thats why she in the gaming scene
what happened with the verse of the day  that was the best part of each video
truths bombs forced me to hit thatsubscribe button
her rant should not have been part of g4. it had no business being there. she should of done that elsewhere. chat got to her and she wanted an outlet w o caring about the consequences. aaand she wasn t even correct about everything in her rant lol its nuts that foreskin and sesspool are still employed yet are two of the biggest reasons g4 lost views and subs xd
its why the rest of the gaming industry is terrible  because of people  activists like frosk  that get upset and lash out at other people and she knows thatshe betrayed the viewer base of g4 right now! she knew better this  and she is responsible for her co-workers getting fired  she knows that they are mad at her and its her fault that they lost their  and she s happy and proud of that! what a horrible person she is!
she be the kathleen turner of g4!
g4 was only good originally because we the audience had no idea how shitty these people were. when g4 made its return they felt emboldened to show us just how garbage they are and how much they loathe us.
honestly it makes me sick thatshe s still there.

damn
g4 worked better when it was g4 techtv. even making it 75  25 videogames and tech and it would be multiples of times better.
it was really the frosk rant that killed g4 to begin with.  their original model may have been unsustainable  but they were never given the opportunity to refine it.  frosk nuked their viewership from orbit and there was no going back after that.  it was just a steady plummet back to earth at terminal velocity.  I hope other companies and networks take note and know not to hire frosk after this.  you are just inheriting someone else s bad will.  there is nothing to be gained.
she is showing her true colors
my dear dear melonie  everyone has an different opinion in some form  but you say in regard to foreskin as if it were something newly discovered. opinions in general matter little because of the nature of their randomness  versatility  but more importantly their source of origin which is from our own imagination  and like any imagination we use it in most cases to fill in the gaps of what we do not know  but as a wise man once said  the beginning of knowing anything is admitting you do not know anything. opinions can be quite harmless  but in todays world they cause more damage than anything else because of how caught up in those opinions imagination people get  and also refuse to break from due to how much they value them. forskin cared more about her own ego  freedom to prove in that moment how   strong and independent   she was  to give the finger to an audience she felt threatened by because of her own flaws within herself. she in effect was behaving like a brat teenager with an axe to grind  and from that moment she deserves nothing  no second chance  no benefit of any doubt what so ever. the passage of time and clarity of observation are wonderful gifts of nature  and she chose to throw them aside in favour of her own arrogant quest for self indulge power  so life itself will one day slam her to the floor with one foot on her chest and simply say   silence child  you have much to learn  .
my gramps tended to say the loudest person in the room is usually full of bs or up to some bs.
some people just want to be angry at the world. I feel like frosk has a permanent chip on her shoulder. unfortunately for her its kind of an ugly look.
sega saturn developers were more passionate. sega is alive and will be alive and they never failed honestly. it wasn t a clean fail it was a managed fail. it will come out soon.
great take  subbed.
I think its great what frosk is doing  gets annoying people like you and the people in these comments out of the g4 community  if you even watched the videos to begin with...
they all claped while she was ranting. all of them deserve to be fired!
wow  g4 still has a business
I loved frosk when she was a commentator for the chinese lol league  she did her job and she did it wellsomewhere somehow she decided to become a crusading gay cry bully Ive lost all respect for her
they shoulda had this girl bein easy on the eyes for everyone in g4 s relaunch maybe it woulda succeeded. lol.
when viewers supporters continue to support a company thats allows its employees trash those viewers supporters  then Im sorry but the viewers deserve everything that they get going forward. stop funding supporting the companies that hate or dont care about you.
new viewer  new sub. good channel
g4 was never meant to appeal to  hardcore  gamers it was mostly a casual crowd back in the early 2000 s. the collapse of the channel was the same reason as mtv failing. they were all being stuck up acting like rockstars and having dumb shows that didn t involve gaming at all. frosk is wrong with what she said but this goes to show that gamers nowadays are more toxic than ever. twitch being a huge factor causing swatting  deaths  suicides  emotional stress from a collective concious of 50 000 people in a chat box. oh well not like we can go back in time
what do you think about crystal dynamics regaining control of tomb raider   legacy of kain franchies
I really really hope karma bites frosk in the arse.one day  when she s just one step removed from having to look for a 9-to-5 job  imagine the horror!   sarcasm    and she hits up one of her former associates for a recommendation  reference  etc  I hope the person remembers what she did at g4 and slams the door in her face.
story over gameplay isn t a deal breaker for me but yes  modern games lack passion and typically use cheap tricks to pad out their gameplay. Im really not a fan of the forced walking cutscene.
I love the last of us 2   you enjoyed playing it     no I enjoyed having lesbians!
yeah  I was surprised at that too.
Imade a video about this already
I dont think its frosks fault that layoffs are happening. its g4tv s managements fault. they re the ones who decided to  revive  this programming format  and they re the ones who made the decision massively deviate from the original format. and last but not least  they re the ones who failed to see that frosks feminist tirade was definitely grounds for termination. she should ve been fired right after it and get replaced by someone else  someone with a less  activist  mindset.had g4tv done this instead of supporting her rant and go  stunning and brave!   the company would not have been tanking due to non-existent viewership by now.
what a lot of these  gamer  journos want  are nothing but gone home. if that is to be the future of gaming  then the game industry is to be in a world of hurt. because gone home and everyone s gone to the rapture arent going to pay the bills for these game studios  now are they  these are more art house games  rather than something you d play on the ps5.
know what killed g4 to me back in that day  youtube  specifically james rolfe the angry video game nerd avgn at cinemassacre
how much of a sunk-cost fallacy is keeping g4 from firing the biggest cause of their constant failure  they could have only fired frosk  and their viewership would have shot waaaaay back up.
27k views  g4tv must be jealous
the tragic thing about this is it could have all been avoided. if frosk would just grow out her hair  put on a little make up  stop dressing like a boy and start brushing her teeth she d actually probably be bangable and no one would have had to complain in the chat.
eh  mel. I believe you at the end  where you said frosk hates gamers. Ive seen the video and recognize the tells in her personality  but when you say thatshe hates gamers  it helps if you follow up with examples and such. why  because presentation. youre making a video. presentation.
your getting more views than g4
who remembers dark void  that was a fun game  though the mechanics got a little old. the cinematics were boring and historically inaccurate as hell  but the gameplay was fun!
wow an intelligent   good looking female being honest. very rare these days.
so refreshing to hear a nuanced opinion from a woman who loves games and can see the hipocrisy in the woke preaching we see all too often in media. I too respected frosk for her league of legends casting. I also loved adam sessler back when he hosted x-play on g4tv back in the day.  its so sad to see people that I respect falling to the brainwashing by the cultists that preach inclusivity while simultaneously alienating anyone who doesnt fully agree with them. Ive found thatsome of the most hateful people are the people who claim to be  anti-hate .
frosk is the epitome of the entitled generation.in my days  yes Im almost 60  we would have stepped aside if we d caused so much collateral damage to a company or venture.100  entitlement  and zero integrity.love to all  feel no hate
someone put something in this girls hands so she can chill out
sort of a tangent here  but since you did rant about how so many of these gamer activist types feed the creation of modern cutscene bloated walking simulators... I dont play too many aaa games anymore. yeah every once in a while you get a solid aaa release like a doom doom eternal  resident evil  or souls game. but the majority of the best games Ive played over the last 5 or 6 years have been indie titles or mid-level releases from big publishers.
this is what happens when you hire an activist ..
to be unreasonably fair to frosk  I really dont think that rant was just a spontaneous utterance on her part  with no involvement whatsoever from the writers or the higher-ups. she probably does believe this stuff  and heck maybe it was her idea to do the rant  but I can all but guarantee thatshe got corporate approval and support to go do it. so people laying the entire blame for g4 s downfall on her shoulders alone is unfair. its pretty obvious this was a  deeply misguided  corporate marketing decision.thatsaid  she should have had the basic decency and common sense to just shut up and pretend not to exist on the day her colleagues all got fired. if she had to say anything  maybe some generic message of support to the fired co-workers might have done  this was just tasteless and narcissistic.
Imiss old g4 no not cause I had the hots for the female host  I was a pre teen chill but would be lying if I didn t had the hots for them still shocking all them had maxim shoots tho  but like g4 built its self on dude bro jokes and the network was good but now like all reboots a husk of what made it good.seeing it burn is sad makes me wish it didn t return. and riding the coat tails of popular figures deff wasn t needed big time.
she s a terrible person.  she s causing the company to plummet  yet the company is too weak to cut her off and is eliminating many others who did nothing wrong  then she mocks them!!!  frosk deserves nothing resembling respect.
adam sessler was my huge disappointment throughout this whole thing... many of us grew up with him and to have his true feelings about many of his fans being brought to our attention really tarnished the memories... he s a disgusting person. honestly  frosk simply put the microscope on g4 lol
a prime example of  get woke  go broke .
baaahahaha
her rant I discussed was a perfect example of that  calling gamers misogynists lol
@melonie mac go boom  ah jeez! I sound like Im nitpicking.  know what  I am nitpicking. pay it no mind
doom sucks and 2 is better. I only play retro or inde games. modern graphics suck. let it rot
@tempo looking 2022  I love both of the new doom games. I feel like id really knocked it out of the park with both.not sure where the modern graphics comment is coming from  but I suppose everyone has their own taste.I think a lot of modern graphics are amazing  the problem is too many aaa titles focus on pushing graphics and forget about developing a style.
@pejota615  there is doom  doom  doom 64  ultimate doom  and hexagon. the rest are trash rip-offs that no one wanted likexdoom 2020.
@tempo looking 2022  lol chill out dude
@pejota615  there s no modern doom game.
he was super nice when Imet him in person  but then again I had pink hair back then
@melonie mac go boom  lol a valid point to take from that is a civil society exists outside of the internet for the most part.
they should just call it quits and wait a few years and relaunch with new people that dont use the politics as the base of the channel
she is an albatross  round g4 s neck. she will be the last person let go due to the impossibility in current year for certain types of people to catch any blame at all  no matter how richly deserved. makes you laugh.
5 hour games multiply that by 20 and we have a starting point.
I haven t paid attention to a single game reviewer in the past 6 or 7 years. they are like a critic s score on rotten tomatoes  a third nipple or tits on a bull... completely superfluous.
bragging about being the last rat on a sinking ship is a weird flex.
saddest part is her polarizing views will keep her gainfully employed somewhere because she s  progressive   no matter what. Im sure kotaku  huffpo and wapo have already reached out.
I got so fed up with microsoft  and the gaming industry in general  that I sold my series x. soon after I was vindicated when phil spencer  gamer advocate extraordinare  lashed out at said gamers  telling them they  needed to respect the developers   that were shitting all over gamers  hopes and dreams. the industry has become so toxic  dismissive  and divisive that fewer and fewer games are coming out as viable sources of escapism.
well said
frosk isn t a gamer. she s a gypsy journalist. bounces from one job to the next destroying the company that hires her.
how does she even still have a job at g4
the reason g4 doesnt fire frosk is because you guys keep talking about her. bad publicity is still good publicity.
couple things  I honestly dont know how frosk walks down the hallway at g4 and can look at her coworkers in the eye knowing thatshe torpedoed the entire company for her own selfish reasons and hard feelings. could u imagine losing ur job cause some dumb bitch told 95  of ur customers to fuck off   u are working in a plush 20k sq ft studio and basically having fun for a living and then one person ruins it for literally everyone. secondly melonie is right  there rarely was an easy mode in older games it was  normal  and  hard   I remember when I saw ninja gaiden s cutscenes for the first time  they were like an amazing reward for the difficult yet compelling gameplay. nowadays  these casual  gamers  want the games to be interactive movies where the play to watch ratio 5-95 . they wanna play games where losing is not an option and difficulty is nonexistent and bc these corporate game publishers want to cater to the widest possible customer base these posers are getting what they want. the only games now u can play that have built in difficult gameplay  good artistic vision  and actual passionate development are indies and while Im happy they exist its still sad that this is what the industry has devolved into over the years. gaming has surpassed movies and television monetarily in entertainment and the greed has been on full display for last 10 years to the point where the industry is unrecognizable from what it once was and to me its incredibly sad to see. just like modern hip hop  this thing we once loved used to have passionate artistic people behind it creating music and games bc they loved the medium and now since its become solely about the money its all gone to shit. I just want things to go back to when pride and quality were more important than popularity and money.
the fact that they chose to fire sally from hr and not frosk or sessler tells you where their priorities are. those two people are most responsible for why those people are being fired  but they clutch those hateful pearls anyways. g4 deserves to fucking burn and I ll be glad when the fire is finally extinguished.
gamers welcomed activists into their hobby. activist took over the hobby. activists gatekeep the gamers out of their hobby. who are the intolerants
maybe this will g4 cause for them to lay her off.
frost may hate gaming and her job  but does she really have any other talents to offer  any talents at all
the mediocrity of most modern aaa games is why Imostly stick to proven games that have been around for 10 years like warframe and warthunder  they are still leagues better than most modern games.
I just beat back to back mega man 2 and castlevania on nes. not 1 corpo journalist can do that  cant even do the cuphead tutorial.
Im a father of two daughters and I have a successful career.  they play sports also.  I dont have a lot of time to game.  but I prefer long games with good story and if Im going to watch commentary I want it to be in depth and thoughtful.  I dont play this woke garbage.  and I prefer hard games like souls or elden ring or a deep rpg.
frosk seems like she has no home training! smh!
yeah  the politics as an identity to base media off of is only going to get worse. so the best you can hope for is it gets re-rebooted based on your politics and not the other.
but they have no more money
expect when they do fans either trash them to no end or prise them to no end and there is no middle ground. its the apple syndrome.  so much so you have people defending trash cough oneplus 10t  pixel 6a  and iphone 14pro cough. now its the same with a game like elden ring. its a very poor action rpg game with a very poor story and very poor open world.skyrim for all of its flaws is far better in ever way.
@evacody124   I have a friend that keeps gloating about his new iphone.  its got a better camera than your galaxy  no it doesnt.  apple is dominating samsung.  no its not.  the new iphone is cheaper than samsung.  whopty ficking doo  for the first time ever  I have 20  years of experience with apple devices  they have always been shit  and the always will be. I ll stick with my galaxy. at least I know it will keep working until I can actually afford a new phone.
well you cant throw sessler in there because he s one of the few reasons people watch xplay theres more people that watch for nostalgia than who dont watch. politics be dammed.
you can see that with every video he s in and the engagement  thats just being objective however you can also see no one is watching for her. people have commented thatsince their favorite creators aren t there anymore they aren t watching anymore
hell has openings lol
they could have survived forsk s bullshit if they produced something people wanted to watch.   spoiler alert  I have any number of gaming channels I can watch now. the same applies to any topic you can imagine up. g4 was destined to die. this ain t 2005. people have options.
feel like youre missing the mark on hating on  cutscene games.  I dont have any problem with games entirely based on stories. some amazing games are like that  because the storytelling medium is fantastic. plenty of game devs still go for gameplay and story together  there s certainly room for story driven games.
I put in 350 hours into monster girls paradox. I own 8 consoles and 3 hand helds.
I was never going to give frosk benefit of the doubt after her company killing rant. I can understand if a speech comes across not as intended then I will give benefit of the doubt. frosk meant every word and her far left woke bull shined through. now this tweet proves how vile she is. she caused or at least a big part of why these layoffs happened. yet she gloats she didn t get the chop. she should have been sacked. if apple did this stunt back in 2002 just as the ipod launched it would have been a disaster.  sexism in music  would not have gone down well and the ipod would never have been a huge juggernaut it was. g4 could have saved face and been ok  but no sided with frosk. frosk killed g4 with her rant  yet no punishment  g4 is dying and yet will not remove the poison  g4 got what they deserve and I hope the one s who lost their jobs get new better ones in better companies. they deserve better than g4.
its hilarious that a rings of power ad played when I clicked on the thumbnail for this video.
g4 is scared of the lgq whatever mob going on a smear campaign  people that dont even watch the platform. meanwhile more and more people who want to watch g4 can longer stand the stench and stop watching. what do you want g4  support from people who dont care about or spend the time to watch you  or an audience that wants to talk about games and geek stuffs  I think they ve chosen.
the sony cinematic walking sim template with generic dark souls shovelware combat and or generic ubisoft arkham open world meets tomb raider has really set gaming back. tacked on rpg skill tree elements are a boring time sink.
I wonder how many of the women she talked about in her rant  survived  along with her.  very disrespectful.
this has always been her. its who she is. gamers knew this. her opening her mouth only confirmed it. she s worse than an  elitist . she s someone who believes herself an  elitist   who s not even that. just like adam sessler.
woman moment
how are  fans  responsible for the acts a few individuals make   if individuals have made posts that can be seen as actual and factual harassment  there are laws to deal with that.  no one but those individuals who are doing the wrong action is responsible for the wrong action.  claiming that a category of people are somehow responsible for the acts of a a few individuals is simply ridiculous.  blaming others for the actions of individuals because of category membership is a terrible approach.  frosk did this.then there is the wisdom in an individual attacking a category that is defined as those who support and are customers of the individual or the company the individual works under.the company could shown support of their customers and  fans .  instead  they chose to disrespect and demean them and agree with frosk s attack on them.
this randomly popped up in my feed and I gotta say its nice to see gaming coming around somewhat. you are dead on with posers in the gaming community too  anita sarkeesian being the clearest example by far...  I played a game once...  does not qualify you to speak about video games  much less kick in the door of an industry thats done far more than most. I play games to escape from a day of drudgery and monotony  not as an opportunity for mal-adjusted individuals to screech at me and make demands that I legitimize their bullshit.
the bots made them believe their own propaganda
nah  basically the entire crew on g4 is hurting its reputation. not that this reboot has much of one anyways. the entire channel always tries to push a sjw woke agenda. most are subtle about it  but a few are in your face with it. frosk happens to be the latter. I used to watch g4 back in the day because they actually focused on games gaming and gamers  they dont do that anymore. she loves to rant and rave about  toxic  this and  toxic  that  but she is toxic just like most of the people that call others  toxic .
she rambles like me  subscribed.
while could care less about g4  once sessler wanted to kill me just cause how I vote. anita destroyed gaming  single handedlywasnt the guy clapping proved to be a legitsexist  the black hokagey
I dont think its frosk. I think its the entire g4 team. frosk was chosen because of how she is  not in spite of it. also... she s just gloating there. I actually dont have an issue with that  her rant though... thats an issue. I can respect a person who gloats when their haters are disappointed  even if those haters have a point.
some people just want to watch the world burn
frosk is why I support the chinese government banning games from the west.videogame production has been hijacked and you almost cant get games that dont carry a toxic social narrative anymore.
she s somebody that I looked up to  okay normie
I feel like you missed the mark on what was said. I didnt hear her say at any point that there is not room for story driven games within the medium. she seems to be talking about games that push everything aside to hold your hand to push you through a story and that is all there is  being the type of game that frosk s intended demographic are into. you are probably correct  I just dont play many story driven games anymore so I really dont know  that there are games that have both compelling gameplay and a good story along side of that game play  that just is not the point melonie was aiming to hit.
story games can be fun at times  but let s face it  they aren t actual video games. they re interactive movies.
@melonie mac go boom  sounds like some gatekeeping to me.
she probably wasn t fired cause she d probably sue for mysoginy  however  g4 will just fail and she ll go down with it.
every time I click on one of your videos  I see an ad for rings of power.
shes not the sole reason but a major one because blair and adam were talking political trash on twitter as well which turned people off
frosk has become the cancer of g4 they should have fired her in the first place when she did that rant and now she put them in really bad situation to begin with I wish they released thatshe is the problem
even if it wasn t her fault they got laid off its still a shitty human being thing to do. if I was one of those employee s I d be doing a tell all.
carnivore mac go boom
you know... g4   a dead horse have a lot in common... they where such a beautiful thing back in the day  but got beat to death by people who never gave a shit about them.
total narcissistic sociopath  she s like a villain in a movie.
she is trying the same tactics that failed before
looks like the g4tv employees got froskbitten. shame on frosk!
they make me think they want to read a book  but they re too lazy and lack the imagination to make a book fun
these people just live in their bubbles. but dont worry  their time will pass  only a matter of time. in the end  everyone needs to make money.
what in the hell is frost urine  yellow snow kind of thing
yo melonie I havent been getting your videos in my inbox before this one in awhile
how on earth havent she been sacked yet
they didn t fire frosk and she wont shut up. g4 doesnt learn.
she will finish off g4 eventually.
oh man  someone needs to make  bounding into comments   look at the potential. going through the dumbest comments you can find. o.o it would be so tight. endless content you just have to pollute your mind with all the terrible things.
what about zipper  !
her attitude is just the general product of her being a horrible person.
baaaah
@melonie mac go boom  I guess this is the cost of too much coverage.
youtube doing what youtube does itseems
this woman is fine
oh no  it got worse  Ive been out the loop
she was basically the sole reason for the decline and tons of other people were fired for it. where s the justice in that
you right there no fun being a gammer now I still play games and all g4tv back then it was about games and fun stuff now it like wtf sorry but is true I happy I am a gammer
frosk bite!!! lmfaoshe is a clown
Im sure all the people who were laid off could tell the difference between a playstation   an xbox.
thatsurvived post is still there
facts
go woke go broke
Im australian  someone help me understand.how she said  ostensibly  is that how americans say that word- austin-sibily
I saw that frosk episode live heard that bizarre rant and never watched g4 again sucks to with how adam sessler I watched as a kid
she got fired lulz
frosk keeps failing up. she will be ceo of victimhood for comcast in a few months.
she doesnt do that tattoos and crop top nearly as well as you.
are you olivia munn s stunt double
I lvoe watching these older vids knowing the outcome of her basically telling all make viewers they were sexist piles of shit and not to watch the show lul
such a  charming  individual...
this girl is so cuteeeee
aoc frosk 2028
haha look haters  I am still here .  so  we didn t watch you before you think we start now  so who was that targeted at  if not former coworkers.  it wasn t the non audience  as they already dont care
no  thats just her. most americans under 50 have never heard the word at all.
rofl
this is a result of gaming going mainstream. when it was just a  nerd hobby  it was great. now we ve got all these casual posers who play nothing but fifa  madden  call of duty  fortnite and gta online primarily. now every video game developer makes games that cater to these people to maximise sales when only a small amount in comparison to those games actually buy anything outside of that. and when they do they go on twitter and cry that these games are too difficult  or you got the sony crowd who will cry if the game doesnt put the story first. gaming going mainstream was the worst thing that happened to it. now all we get is unfinished  copy pasted broken dumbed down shit and people thank the game makers for it.
sessler and his walrus clap. good grief!
I only play classics and indie games these days.
lol  referring to ps1 games as the old retro games.
Ive dated feminists before.  trust me   nothing is ever their fault.
mac!!!!!
she must not have known too much from lol because she used to get called out for being wrong or scrappy hot takes and just call people mysoginists as her defense.... sounds familiar huh  but then she didn t only deal on the fans  again another obvious red flag  she complained about the amount of white people at a tournament.... in europe. the person who hired her at g4 ignored multiple signs of her narcissism and bad fan interaction.... surprise she hasn t changed.
I didn t know who she was.  my first exposure to her was her rant and that made me not want to see anything more from her.
you look up to that monster
hello melonie
what reputation
the tweet was bad. I lot of shitshe got was unfair until that tweet.
hImelonie thoughts on cyberpunk edge runners anime on netflix
league of legends gave her the boot for the same shit. what was g4 thinking  it would change
when you say walking simulator video games can you give me examples which video games are they lol because I didn t know there shch thing . I need to know so I can be aware not to buy these games in the future
two words elden ring
is it actually an xx or is it an xy playing pretend
melonie this is what happens when a company insults their audience.I hope austin creed and jirard the  completionist leaves soonthey are too good of guys to be associated with g4
ms. melonie I think you should be the host of g4 not frosk
9 months and  100mil dollars and cost 30 jobs. thats the price of feminism and woke
good for you. I am just done with the whole hollywood style of storytelling games have adopted these days.
an example of retro games  which it literally is lol
too many white people here!  - whitest person I have ever seen
I looked up to her esports hosting talent  yeah
agreed. I dont know austin  but jirard is good people
@melonie mac go boom  austin creed is xavier woods of wwe. his real name is austin creed.he owns the wwe gaming youtube channel upupdowndown
boom
wow thats not cool. they sucked way before this happened but she was the straw that broke the camel
these fake game journalists are the ones harassing the from software devs to put an easy mode in elden ring and there souls games
what s thatsong
she should ve kept her mouth shut on politics.  should ve kept to game talk.
she hates gamers because she has been rejected by the gaming community for years  she used to start fights with the lol community with her political bullshit.
she s trash. I did feel bad for her. not any more. single-handedly tanks a company. then mocks the people who got fired  who she claimed to care about. nope that aint it girl friend.
ppl on the left side of the social aisle tend to be somewhat more selfish and immoral.
g4tv
hey beautiful women enjoyed your conversation
you  like anyone else  still dont answer the question   she caused the downfall of g4.  and she is still there. and is still being paid.   wtf

sadly agree to disagree no longer exists on one side of the isle  if you disagree with them on even the most trivial things youre an istaphobe.
fired now
that is exactly why I hate g4 of frock. I play games to forget about the  politics  of life. I hope they fire the  hag
did you give up on the Bible mel  that was the best part
ehh this company is basically dead at this point  might as well make frosk the new ceo of this dumpster fire.
lyk omgz this walking sim is such an inspiration! if u disagree ur a bigot
well  the channel is dead  and no one is watching. but she survived. if a tree falls in the forest
elden ring needs a harder mode if anything. it was my first soul s game and I ran through it pretty easy. some bosses took many tries though! summons ruined the game too  making it too easy. mimic can solo the game which is ridiculous
I implement itsometimes  but Ive been doing more of that in discord and my streams. the Bible verses were adding a lot of extra time to my videos which can be punishing in the algorithm  especially since it was more like two videos in oneeven so I do naturally talk about my faith in Jesus at at least some capacity in most my videos
in fork s defense... I am pretty sexist.
frosk is vile.
I say let em. I never cared for g4tv since it first went out. stopped watching around 2010 and itstays there.
you looked up to her during her lol days ! that cnt made thatshit unwatchable!
indiana black
why would you look up to a demon melindfy.
!!maybe tou fuys are looking at it wrong !  maybe  follow me here. she is just really good at destroying things look at the awesome movie pretty womanrichard gere would go in to a company. destroy the insides. and prepare it for.....the new owners......  !
I shouldn t have to have my volume at 100 100 just to hear you. please fix your audio.
frost sabotaged g4tv over of her jealousy of olivia munn because she is bangable. her latest rants is why should never hire a woke feminist. screen people before hiring  that might help.
the rant  thar ruined it all.adding insult to injury  she was the only one that didn t get laid off and gloats about itsmfh
let g4 fail like all this other modern woke trash. first time viewer to the channel here. subbed.  dontsupporttrashentertainment
game journos aren t gamers plain and simple
this person because I dont what it is should of been sacked ages ago because this is all happening because this person ehh
frosk has gone too far. I think she needs to be removed from g4tv...
g4tv is dead
love to see g4 going down. go woke go broke. but she should have been first......
I have to agree to disagree to agree but disagree with agreeing and not agreeing to disagree and agree to agree to agree disagreeingly disagreeing to agree disagreeing on disagreeing  do you agree
dont get why she stayed on since the knowledge she had was pretty well misguided on playstation. but all in all dont care she an insensitive chick. but its acceptable cuz misogyny right .
os-ten-sibly not osten-sibly! arrrggghhh!
she is a fake gamer lol
I dunno what setup youre using  but on both pc and on my mobile phone the audio is plenty loud. Ive not seen anyone else say it was quiet either so I dunno why it is for you
actually knows her stuff  . but she said ps5 was dead on arrival. lmmfao I cant respect people thatsay stupid ish like that. she is toxicaf.
g4 is dead... the body just hasn t cooled yet. frosk and the blue hairs she represents make up less than 5  of the gaming community... so if g4 is catering to less than 5  of the gaming community... then dont fire frosk... otherwise  g4 is dead.
never supported it.
g4 need to get rid of her and especially adam sessler.
who
even if frosk were fired  I still wouldn t watch the current iteration of g4tv. sessler is a bad person. like  objectively a bad person. no thank you.
I thought frosk was a dude.
5 hours    Im 120 hours into fallout 4 with 100  mods and Im not even close to the end....get that 5 hour bullshit out of here!
it all started after she made several ridiculous comments i.e. hogwarts legacy was an xbox exclusive  that xbox was going to crush playstation this generation and that ps5 has had no games released since launch.anyone who is a gamer will know that every single one of those comments is wrong and laughably wrong  therefore many of us called her out on it by simply telling her that if she s going to talk about gaming  then maybe she should do some homework and actually know what she s talking about  before making ridiculous  sweeping  statements that are bound to antagonise people.then  rather than saying Im sorry Imade a mistake  she decided to double-down online attacking people on twitter and then further exacerbated the problem by deciding to call everyone sexist and misogynistic  lumping everyone in with the half a dozen trolls  who may have actually said something offensive and it backfired spectacularly.I genuinely feel sorry for the innocent people who lost their jobs  simply because a narcissist couldn t take a little constructive criticism. however  when it comes to everyone who clapped and cheered as if she d done something spectacular  in my opinion they got exactly what they deserved  their p45  because it was extremely unprofessional. I just wish frosk had lost her job as well  even more so following that completely disrespectful and tone-deft tweet. I really cannot understand the decision behind keeping her on.
I loved g4 growing up  when I saw her rant  I unsubbed immediately.
I gotta disagree on one point.. she sucked back on league of legends too. back then I watched the pros all the time  na had a great commentary team and then frosk turned up. I always tried to give her a chance but I always found her so dam unlikable! lol I always felt like she was trying too hard to fit in. she just wasn t natural.. so even back then she was clearly a diversity hire.
she is tone deaf as hell.
gross.
why does no body just tell these woke people that want more inclusion to make it themselves then  make a game movie with a black transgender duck if you want others to waste money on a failure you do it and you deal with the fallout.
honest question.who watches g4  how it is any good to watch  no idea how it exists. frosk or not. independent youtube content is much better than a lame network trying to be  how do you do  fellow kids
g4 is dead.
the only games I have bought are indie like cult of the lamb and cuphead or fromsoft. I refuse to pay  60  dollars for a movie made by soy filled lefists.
why do you keep giving the benefit of the doubt to people who haven t earned it  it makes you look like a fool.
she knew her stuff on league at least  but for a general gaming show she was over her head
in japan it is.
where is the porn that was on the cable station
diversity hire  and she probably knew it too. that would actually explain her trash attitude.. like  it must suck knowing maybe you dont deserve it and that would probably make you quick to get defensive over anything. lol
na had an all star cast of casters... kobe jatt  preak  markz  cptflowers  etc  literally the cream of the crop. all fairly high level players in their own regard with high game knowledge. then frosk  who doesnt even play the game  comes in and pretends she s the most knowledgeable lol. now they re moving in a  more diverse  direction and the casting has got so much worse. na lcs had the best casters in esports hands down and theyve tossed that away to appease twitter
@marty mcfly 88mph  yeah the team slowly started to change  I slowly stopped watching. I think na wanted their own version of sjokz.. so they they hired frosk!
I dont like judging people  its tough for me
