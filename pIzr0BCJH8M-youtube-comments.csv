there was a meme about this years ago. itshowed a photo of barbie and the caption reads  this is barbie. for years now she has been criticised over her unrealistic standard of beauty which leads to self esteem issues in young girls.  there is another photo next to it. the caption just reads  this is he-man.
sexualization has been a pretty focused selling point in almost every single adult teen rated game  show and movie. is it unnecessary  certainly yes but it brings in the audience. what s stupid is that these dumbass companies are listening to biased idiots on twitter who absolutely know nothing about marketing and only care about pushing their opinions on everything they can get their hands on. Im perfectly fine with sexualization but the double standards really piss me off.
mainstream media  stop sexualizing and objectifying women. also mainstream media  omg naked chris hemsworth.
everyone remember the dragon s crown controversy  they were butt hurt about the women being unrealistic  because one of the female playable characters had big boobs  and another had a big butt. meanwhile  one of the males was such a top heavy triangle he would have broken his own scrawny legs  and the other was so muscle bound  he wouldn t have been able to move.there was also a third character of each sex which was totally normal. its always nothing but hypocricy.
when I first saw this moment in the trailer  my first thought was  alright marvel... let s see you do this to natalie portman . we all know full well that they would never dare and that is what makes this so disgusting.the people who thought this was a good idea are either blind  thick  or just evil.
I would be more amused by the scene if they did the same type of thing to women in films  but instead every woman has to be cool  smart  strong and flawless  while making men look clumsy  dumb  foolish  gullible or humiliated is totally fine. the same people who are totally happy with the sexual objectification of marvel men are also the same people who got pissy because the one female character was caught changing in the star trek movie and they felt it was gratuitous  even though it was utterly tame
you know what s sad  when I watched this trailer the other night  my immediate takeaway was focused on that moment in the trailer. not because I was upset  but because Ive been programmed to notice these things. what should have been a funny and cute scene was immediately politicized in my mind  and my gut reaction was to laugh at the double standard. these are actors and actresses who work their butts off to get in that kinda shape  and Im sure they re ok with showing off their progress. this honestly shouldn t even be a discussion in my opinion  but here we are. hooray for progress  am I right
if someone is sexy and wants to show off  male or female  Im fine with that. likewise if someone doesnt. but the double standard isn t ok.
hemsworth is on record as being uncomfortable being put in scenes like this  too.
it probably would ve been more hilarious if thor was wearing hulk underoos.  please dont tell him.
barbie is an unrealistic expectation for women and young girls.  now here is he-man.the double standard has been around for a while.  my biggest issue with this scene with xhris hemsworth is that it is thor  who once again is just a butt of a joke in the mcu.
I agree with you 100  mel. it is even worse as far as this movie  because right after he gets his clothes ripped off  portman s character says  shouldn t we help him   and  king   ha ha  valkyrie replies   eventually... grape
its so blatantly obvious that double standards like this come from a desire for vengeance  not justice. since something happened to group x  it needs to happen to group y  thats a great way to hurt people who never did anything wrong. there s no justice in that.
Im of the opposite inclination.  let thor and laura croft be sexualized.  its not the only thing we appreciate about them  so the  treating people like meat  thing just doesnt really describe how fans of this stuff feel.
I dont know if its relevant  but speaking to double standards  Ive noticed that in stores  at least in my area  the female mannequins and female models now wildly vary in size and shape  while the male counterparts are still svelte and fit with very little variation. I wonder what the reaction would be if this were brought up in media like it was for women several years ago Im a recovering fat guy  I dont really mind that the men are physically fit  its something I aspire to and my overall goal  so it doesnt negatively affect me. Im just a little bothered by these companies only going halfway in regards to body image  and dont seem to care about having any kind of parity on that front.
as amateur writer  I have had classes where we talked about putting language for shock value or how descriptive scenes should sex scenes be. one of my teachers said the easy way to tell how the scene enhance or detract from the plot or character.  mostly does the story you want to tell benefit from it  we talked about blood and gore in movies like saving private ryan during the beach landing. that opening scene does so much to establish each of our characters  skills and their willingness for following orders. so  we understand why they stay fight at the end of movie.nudity and sex scenes can achieve some of the same aspects. we had the example from the titanic with rose letting jack painted her nude. it was shows how rose had fully changed from the lady that wanted to die at the begin of the movie and now she was open to all options which we see thatshe lived life to the fullest.nudity was used a rule in traveling back in time in the terminator franchise. nudity can be part of location or setting such as striptease and the full monty. the nudity in these movies was more of the backdrop and wasn t distasteful. it help with the immersion into the movie.I can only assumed that they included thatscene was trying to get the women who saw jason momoa without his shirt for most of aquaman to see the movie. again that is an assumption. without seeing movie  I dont have the proper context. I know there were several times where hugh jackman in his wolverine and x-men movies where his bared butt was shown. I know that his clothes were burned off of him when he was trying to stop jean grey as the phoenix. it made sense since she was destroying all matter.personally  it doesnt matter to me if a man or woman does a nude scene but most audience cantell what the motive by how jarring it is. just a thought  if thatscene was not in the trailer  would it make sense or be as jarring with the scenes that led up to that point in the movie
the trailer had valkyrie and jane watching this and eating grapes instead of helping thor  too. of course  I can already hear the wokes screaming calling melonie a puritan and the pharisees ramping up their attacks on her gym selfies. ignore them melonie and keep telling it like you see it.
its soooooo blatant  and you know it works for a lot of them as existential revenge  for perceived past wrongs of males.
I find it interesting that fictictious women deserve more respect than real men these days.
hey melonie!thanks for sharing my tweet. I think the double standards in the mainstream media is getting out of control and it needs to stop
there needs to be a t-shirt of that
exactly.  I was naively hoping we d be past this point  but no its just a power grab out of revenge.  so now nobody s moving forward.
and worst thing about that  the people bitching on twitter do not even buy the product that bent over backwards to please them.
as a guy who deleted his twitter account  twitter seems like the most important thing in the world  until you stop using it. then yourealize the real world doesnt care about twitter. where I live people dont even use twitter.
men have always been called perverts for enjoying female nudity in films  which is a ridiculous accusation in itself if you think about it. so is it fair to call women the perverts now
neil druckmann s wife s boyfriend approves.
it just confirms its all about revenge against men for perceived slights in the past. Im all for women getting hot over a man but dont turn around and talk about the  male gaze  and objectifying women  especially women who went into a career where they could use their looks and make a lot of money from it.
their reasoning is that depicting a muscle bound adonis is okay because its a male power fantasy. insinuating that dudes cant feel the same insecurities that women feel and reaffirming the existence of the  patriarchy
@tom foolery  men want to be desired by women and women want to be desired by men so being sexually attractive is definitely something women want.
no  because normal people dont play shitty anime games
@sirdetmist  exactly right. otherwise instagram wouldnt have 95  users are women showing off their nice bodies.
@huron wyandot  right  they play shitty fps games.
the ironic part is that the amazon is the best character in the game.
ironically elf and wizard were the hottest characters. amazon did have dat donk tho.I agree that the double standard is ridiculous. all characters were stylized in an exaggerated manner. even the npcs. its ridiculous to demand thatsome characters are exempt from it but not others. sexy characters are fine be they male or female.
it was more than that for into darkness. the scene just didn t mesh well with the rest of the film. plus  the whole movie was pretty unorginal and crappy to begin with.however  it does make me wonder if these are the same folks who got pissy over a fat thor in endgame.
at least she was naturally undressing herself and not magically molested .
@zoloft77  very rarely do the shirtless scenes ever make sense in any marvel movie either.
its cause of channels like this.
@lilmovieperp  no its because of celebs like johansson complaining about a bra scene in iron man 2 meanwhile chris is literally treated like meat or how about the constant bs from hollyweirdos like elizabeth banks talking about objectified women to sell tickets melodie and channels like hers didn t start this convo they re just asking what we re all thinking how s this fair or acceptable when they ve complained about women doing much less than chris that isn t even comfortable with this
to be clear  Im not ok with any actor or actress that is coerced or forced into an uncomfortable scene in which they must reveal parts of their body. if they re being paid extra and its voluntary  then I dont care  and no one else should either. Im tired of the culture war crap  and all these social justice warriors inserting themselves into every discussion  and then speaking on behalf of others in hopes of increasing their social creditscore.
@victor von doom  let s be fair  the entire comic superhero movies now are made for women. like naked men  stronk wahman and  thor love and thunder  like that already sounds as either a romcom or a really cheap pornmovie. nothing suprising here though. this is disney going full politics and as with everything else fuck up their revenue by catering pandering to a public that isn t even the consumer of the product. I dont expect disney to be around in 5-10 years time coz they are bleeding money from the eye sockets. its about  the message .
@stijnvdv2  so on one hand  disney is definitely catering to progressives  and they ll assuredly pay the price  financially  at some point. however  there s also something to be said that progress should be made against putting actors and actresses in uncomfortable situations just to sell tickets and thats both genders. its completely fine if its entirely voluntary  though.
he still has personal agency  he could say no if it bothered him that much.
@stacey funk  why are you victim shaming  with your logic amber heard is a victim.  justice4hemsworth  boycottthor nomoreobjectificationofmen believeallmen
this is a pg-13 movie  yet they do this kind of stunt...  this is something you would see on adult swim shows.
@stacey funk  easier said than done when its your job ... hollywood isn t known for taking no for answer heh
@stacey funk  I think that depends of what his contract says. if he has a bad contract they can make him real shit on screen
@stacey funk  way more nuanced than that chris is between a rock and a hard place for these people actors and actresses optics is everything their image is everything they cant just simply say no its easy for us to say cuz we re not in that position they re under such incredible amount of pressure to perform that we put on them no wonder our country has such a mental health issue there is no common ground
@louis xvii  victim ! victim of what exactly
@knox2don  I dont use twitter and I have said the same thing about women. its not a  shade of grey  argument.
@thorburn j schwegler  you can always say no to a situation such as this. they dont have a movie without him. it would just depend on how much you are willing to sacrifice for your principles. either you stand by them or you dont.
@stacey funk   they dont have a movie without him  all these actors are replaceable its easy for you to say  its not thatsimple turning down roles  I can go on and on but know its  more complex of a problem that has massive repercussions that will have a domino effect he cant be selfish he has other people to care for  just like the coronavirus where the employers mandate their employees to get the vaccine and if they dont they dont have a job they cant just simply quit they have people to take care of
honestly this made me laugh out loud for far too long
yeas
@thorburn j schwegler  you are absolutely right. my job took precedence over my principles just last year because Imade a promise to my wife. I am aware and honest that I violated my own principles and it also taught me that my principles weren t thatstrong to begin with. I violated them but if they had been real principles would I have been able to violate them  did I ever have any principles to begin with or was I just fooling myself  if you truly believe in something then you wont betray it  I firmly believe that while at the same time I can admit to being weak and failing my own heart.
I always thought since media is over-saturated with eye candy for men  why not counteract that by making more eye candy for women. as long as they are comfortable doing so of course. this just makes me sad. I cant imagine enjoying a character portrayed in a suggestive manner knowing the actor felt uncomfortable with it.
@stacey funk  so do  many female actresses..if he has a out then they do too.
@shooting real5  they absolutely do and many exercise it regularity.
@stacey funk  doesnt seem that way if we go by the endless articles of how women in the industry are so oppressed and such.
@stacey funk  lol alright settle down karen weinstein
how has no one talked about how he s clearly on steroids as well   he started out natty  most believe  but he clearly looks juiced in this movie
@ryan  cgI  he s not that big in real life.
@zac  regardless  its still the image being shown  and its quite problematic. the scene was just unnecessary and cringeworthy anyway.
@ryan  unnecessary and cringeworthy are the right words to describe this visual excrement. you got that right. what everyone seems to miss here is that thatscene was designed to humiliate the character and all men along with it. it is written out of spite  malice and bitter toxicity. its because he s male and its socially acceptable to dump on men  sometimes under the guise of  progress  and  equality   sometimes they drop the act and dont even bother with pretending and go straight up misandric .
the actual issue is how society sees both sides. one can acknowledge how its wrong and he was uncomfortable and still bring up personal agency. but how do you think people would react if a director  said  she didn t want to do the scene  said  Im not a piece of meat   and I said  yes you are    how do you think that would pan out  the amount of times you have to switch the genders to realize something s wrong is wild.
source for that claim
yes  and  progressive feminists  will tell you they are both  male fantasies   the hot woman and the powerful guy. however  the hot woman is also a female fantasy  honestly it is more female than male. every woman wants to be hot  and the basic currency that is in the fabric of our society is attention. people love attention  women get it through being hot and sexy  men get it through being pwoerful and competent  its just how it is.the exessive criticism to hot women in media comes from resentful women who aren t hot  thats basically it. its like the incels  but female. they cant get what they want  so they want to destroy it. and in their quest they go against everything thats beautiful and inspiring.
we should probably have expected this since chris hemsworth has no problem portraying characters being the butt of a joke  me here referencing the female ghostbusters remake  where he plays the dumb assistant whose the butt of a lot of jokes.
welcome to modern hollywood writing. men are incompetent butt of jokes. its like every movie now is an episode of simpsons family guy american dad where the focus is on the father character being stupid all the time.
@carlos gustavo  the difference though is  being hot  was like a personality trait for female characters. in a lot of cases it was all they existed for. I dont see anything wrong with using attractive people  like you said everyone wants to be hot. but Im under no illusions thatsexy women and powerful men  considering the overwhelming majority of media has been created by men  are part of the male fantasy. I understand the logic behind not wanting to sexualise women  but its definitely kind of rubberbanded too far to one side of the spectrum. its like femininity is distasteful now or something.
you are 100  right! this rubbish isn t about women s dignity or equality or anything worthy. its all about tearing thor down and playing up his modern female counterfeiters. female characters can get away with anything in modern marvel  for more evidence  see wandavision and doctor strange 2  where scarlet witch acts like a villain and gets praise for it .
@skywolf c20  disney has access to some of the greatest heroes of all time and all they want to do is tear them down to build up new characters no one want or lambast them for the crime of being male it boggles the mind tbh
yeah  it really pisses me off. they just come off as a bunch of ass holes  and so I can care less about their characters. if disney thinks this is the way to bring women up  they are very wrong. disney is just too lazy to do any character development nor find a more appropriate way to pass on the torch to another character.
and he s juiced up in this movie  or maybe its the cgI  which makes itso much worse  sigh
yeah that would be very different if the characters were swapped
social revenge  thats exactly what it is.
companies only care about the money they can make from these things. having female mannequins of various sizes likely increases sales. also  men generally care less about that kind of stuff  myself included as a guy
me and a study partner in college did a paper comparing the wide variation in types among female models while the men looked almost identical
@ningannel  I only noticed it because so much attention was paid to the body images of the female displays in the past. now its like always seeing the spot of yellow on the wallpaper when you would have never cared or noticed before if it wasn t pointed out.
@jarclizzy  same here. I only started taking note of it after watching a video about some nike plus-sized mannequin controversy
how do you know that
@lilmovieperp  huh
love your profile pic lmao
@diendiadre  what
Im kinda in the middle as well. I dont like when the  woke  side tries to cancel anime and video games because of the attractive female characters  but I also dont like the counter-reaction of  yes  let s objectify people and lust after people! there s nothing wrong with that!
I dont know who in their right mind could see someone doing something they re uncomfortable with and get gratification out of it.  sad sadistic noises
just tack this on to the list of things that wouldn t bother me but for the double standard.  though  if they choose to show some man butt  then they gotta know people probably aren t going to bring their kids.  some people...edit  the fact that chris didn t want to do it and was pressured into it makes itso much worse.
personally I want to see fit and good looking people in general  men or women. when I see someone who is in amazing shape that motivates me to work out harder
a media outlet pondered thirst-fully if we d ever get an uncensored version of thor naked  same people who demand censorship for cleavage and anything beyond an a-cup.
by the way vids like this is what makes me feel so at home in your channel   you not one sided   you are not  extremist or hateful   just a girl with grounded views in a culture that is losing its mind.  well mostly grounded anyways   Imean we all have our favorite conspiracies right  lol  .
I remember the lara croft shower scene in the first movie and then the follow up scene where all us guys thought that it was going to be lara again and it was alex west and all us guys were like   no!  and the women were dying laughing  hooting and hollering. my  then wife  looked over at my best friend and I  laughing and said   now you know how it feels. . it was a funny moment and well played by the director. I think core took lara s already curvy figure that didn t need any seduction and ran too far with it in their ad campaigns. the movie spoofed on that perfectly. the double standard has always been there. even back in the 80s and 90s  many comics and even some cartoons made all of us guys think we had to mr. olympia to look good. we didn t feel offended. we wanted to be those strong heroes. now we see that with cosplay for women to have thatsuper hero curvy figure. yet  the current direction of tomb raider is to make her ordinary. just the opposite direction of the comic fan scene. she was always the female equivalent of pierce bronson s portrayal of james bond. she could be classy and posh but then put on her gear and fight and adventure like the upper-class tomboy she was. it was a cool dynamic now lost in the current series.
the double standards have been real for a very very long time
mac always keeping it real!
so thor is rated r ! quick  get my wife  we goin  to the cinema!
you d never see this kinda stuff in the original cartoons. mostly because they were made for kids and would exaggerate doing the right thing because they were heroes and were a story about heroes and as such more virtue and just good morals in general were more prevalent in those than in any of the movies these days and itshows.also love the message in this video. males and females dont need to go down into depravity together just to be  equal . classiness has to make a comback.
as soon as I saw this in the trailer I immediately thought about the backlash that their would be if lady thor was put into this scene  absolute double standards for this. like you said exploited. the whole premise of this trailer seems like its exploiting thor.
gotta agree with ya  mac. it is creepy. especially knowing about casting couch stuff
this is more or less what I was thinking when I saw the trailer.  thor s naked scene is fine in a vacuum  but then I dont ever want to see another article crying about sexualization objectifcation of females.  of course the new thor is part of the woke msheu and it feels like this is being done in bad faith  like  take that men!    ita absurd.  we already know thor will be demoted  again  this time his mantle of thor to natalie portman after giving his title of king to valkyrie.  kevin fiege has to phase out all the white men I guess.
I would say that having a young lady who is not only very attractive  but at the life height of her attraction - her twenties - in a not particularly concealing outfit  arguing quite eloquently against brutal nudity and objectification  while insisting that there is no need to be seen as prudish for that  makes her point by itself.
thank you! its so hypocritical for both hollywood and the  fans  who want to make women the most average and plain person while having no problem forcing an uncomfortable man into an uncomfortable situation to please their own perverted desires.
when I was a kid I was super skinny and got bullied a lot.  I was way into arnold and van damme movies and dreamed about being big and strong.  so my parents talked a gym into letting me join when I was 11 and I worked my butt off.  I got really big and strong and it helped me a lot in life with confidence  dating  not being picked on  and eventually an athletic scholarship to college. I never would have started lifting weights at 11 years old if I didn t have those huge buff dudes in movies to look up to.  I never would have been as good at sports if I hadn t started working really hard at a young age.  it never made me feel worthless or depressed to see those bigger than life dudes in movies and shows as a scrawny kid  it motivated the hell out of me.  so I dont agree with this argument that a character like classic lara has to be made more plain because it only makes women and girls feel useless and ugly or whatever.  you are totally right about the sex perversion stuff.  hollywood and that far side of the political spectrum truly wants to destroy the concept of traditional family  morality  in general  not talking about religion in this sense   and traditional values in general.  they are flat out saying as much these days  its no secret.  I have seen some really weird articles about how family is bad and community should raise children  and we are seeing schools keep secrets from parents and all kinds of crazy stuff.  pushing sex and sexual orientations and the whole trans thing on younger and younger people is a big part of their war on the family.  and I need to say I 100  respect freedom  and an adult has the right to be with who they want and identify how they want  but pushing it on kids and pushing the intense celebration of it is getting way out of hand.  its gone way past tolerance acceptance.
this bs is allowed cap can be objectified all day as well as star Lord meanwhile they go out of their way to tone down hayley atwell in dr.strange 2 and ppl still argue women are the most objectified what a joke
the double standard always existed on so many levels  some how things created for a male target audience got to change the moment women show interest  while for decades most of them didnt wanted to be caught dead anywhere near a comic or game. while we men wouldnt expect or want rom coms for example to be changed for us. the double standard is even bigger when we look how males respond towards beautiful   sexy female characters celebs and women towards beautiful   sexy male celebs characters  going totally nuts asking them to take of their pants shirts. asking telling them to flash their chest and make the most obscene comments and gestures  even towards underage boys . while we men never would get away with it  rightfully so but women shouldnt be able to get away with it either. as for actors  in most cases they know what they signed up for so they shouldnt have taken the job if they had an issue with it. of course I find it different when it was made clear to them before they signed a contract.
I really hate when people nonchalantly say that they re uncomfortable with  insert subject here  and yet they feel compelled to push their ideals when itsuits them and do it in the name of  equality when there is a time I should speak  I am too afraid to do so  because I have been ostracized  belittled  hurt  slandered  and so much more and they get away with it with full impunity. I am trying to be able to actually have control of my life without fear  but I am just so tired.......just so tired  but I have to keep going even with all the pain.....
like with hayley atwell in dr.strange 2 did you notice how toned down she was meanwhile this is fine what a joke
@victor von doom  I didn t see it but going by how proportionately masculine-looking carter was in what if   it wouldn t surprise me. and its more than fine for the media  what makes it infuriating is they are obsessed with thor nude and want more. meanwhile  black widow does a few poses and wears a form-fitting outfit  and has one small blink and you miss it moment of her changing clothes in the backseat of a car and the media melts down bigger than a nuclear reactor.
@frostfang7  yeah she had her bra flash for a couple of seconds meanwhile thor is full bare here Im going to be astounded to see how they play the victim narrative from here on out
@victor von doom  they ll ignore the criticism and focus on the manufactured  outrage  of valkyrie s sexuality  which she wasn t bI in the comics except in one situation recently sorta that was extremely convoluted as to why . I dont expect women to show tons of skin in the mcu or other movies but to me  it feels very deliberate that they are desexualizing them  like they are going out of their way to do so . for example  captain marvel which I woulda preferred was called ms. marvel who was a better iteration before they changed her look and personality to embody the modern feminism ideology. would I have preferred her older costume to what we got  yes  but would expect them to go all the way to make her look like she was wearing a bikinI or fully exposing her midriff and chest  no it would look ridiculous and somewhat impractical despite her durability  but you dont have to strip them of all feminine appeal.
@frostfang7  yeah I wish we had the real ms.marvel as well its a shame they wont adapt the characters and storylines we actually care about instead we re getting rirI chavez and eventually gogurt hulk the mcu was fun while it lasted
@victor von doom  meanwhile they skip out on firebird  brother voodoo  cloak and dagger  titanis  legba and many others many whom they could expand upon from minor characters but lack the creativity. I ll maybe watch the newer marvel movies if Im drunk or friends pay for the tickets but my level of interest is depleting. at least there s still pockets of hollywood that care about fans like sonic.
@frostfang7  they have cloak and dagger but its a freeform show and looked cw-ish so Im not bothering with it
@victor von doom  oh yeah  I forgot they destroyed the inhumans and cloak and dagger.
mel mac  melmac   melmac!   mel is alf confirmed!!
the northmen   thor.
yup  its still perfectly acceptable to objectify a man but God forbid they do that with a woman. gotta make all women characters uglier   cover them up like we re back in the victorian era. cant give a female game character a  sexy  outfit anymore  remember that fiasco with that korean mmo  or wow  or like the multiple other controversies surrounding other games  how about the  boob armor  critique from female mandalorians in thatshow  Imean for crying out loud they re wearing full plate armor  its not like slave leia over here...there s still room for  sexy content  in media  male or female its whatever. Im not bothered by like the volleyball scene in the original top gun for example. but the establishment seems to have doubled down on not allowing females to be attractive while having no problem with objectifying males. personally I d rather not have a hemsworth butt shot in the movie but if I ever do watch it I can deal with it. meanwhile a chick character can have a little bit too much skin or cleavage showing or whatever for the sjw tastes and there s a mob with a trending hashtag about how its a sexist portrayal. seems a bit one sided to me.
I half agree with you. it really depends on the genre of the medium and its context. for example  in say the conan universe- clothing is pretty scant on everyone outside of rag-wearing peasants. in star trek  yes- prefer not to see half-naked vulcan babes wandering around even if that would be hilarious. sex sells. beautiful people sell. the real issue for me with thor is that it is all used as a joke  while people leered and his  friends  looked on and did nothing. imagine is iron man and thor did that while black widow had her clothing ripped off like this in movies past  the blowing up of skirts or the sudden removal of female clothing was used a lot in adult comedies- but was also done a lot to men with them being nude in often very embarrassing ways for the laughs it brought. just look at the porky s movies  etc. all of this is just an attempt at control by modern activists. controlling what you are allowed to laugh at  find attractive  and believe. we are at war for the simple right to just be ourselves.
I agree with u mel  stay strong !!
I remember an ellen nongenerous episode where she visited the office for her staff because one woman working there was obsessed with chris hemsworth so she had chris guest on the show and brought him in to her desk and asked if he would take off his shirt and then they were making a joke of it having him give her a massage and ish  just the wrong message that if youre a fan that these actors actress s like that type of interaction.
I think the writers are deliberately inverting movie roles  making thor dumb eye candy whilst the female characters are placed in the power roles. its basically an inversion of a 50 s stereotype. and they think its clever.
maybe Im an outlier  but I can objectify a woman physically and still have respect for her as a person.  proof of this is thst Ive got great admiration for everything you ve said here  I still think you look super sexy in that outfit. so  I guess Im gifted.
I thought I was the only one that thought this. thanks for bringing some spotlight to it.
wow! melonie has done well in her abs workout  I think she could have taken natalie portman s spot as lady thor!! haha  Imean this with respect.
imagine lara croft had shower scene in front of an arena full of people. those intimate scenes are done subtle with steam and water covering everything anyway  so its the same
agreed with you so much in this vid that my head almost fell off.
your wavey hair looks good mel  just trying to overcome the negative comments!
I appreciate muscular powerful characters  both male and female  and as much as I wanted to see more of chris hemsworth s physique  I dont think I d choose this way. and I still couldn t help but feel the double standard in play here right away. xd
hollyweird has gotten to the point where three fractions exist within its walls  sex  violence and arrogance!  rona barrett 1979
felt on the fence with your channel  but when you transitioned into Bible reading  subscribed
I dont mind if the main characters in the story is eye candy... in fact I encourage it. even if the eye candy is for my lady   I dont mind if  as long as the story is good
I think youre spot on.  I agree with your point of view completely.  if not for their double standards hollyweird have no standards at all.
I like women with great breasts and great bodies. but class and style is yes  time and place!! which is why the porn industry is not going broke...x Im not a religious person but your words hit a spot. Ive been through some vile bullshit from cowards and that experience has made me someone not to be messed with! great channel loving your work and stay strong decent people. cheer s
you make a very good point  and while I am not a big fan of tattoos  you were them well. I am judging you on the gfuel  gamersupps gang!
thank you for reading some scripture in your videos  I dont get enough Bible in my life lately.
this double standards bullshit needs to end
@zoloft77  right  all this signalling and everything else they did   what do you know  they re one of the worst offenders.can we just go back to making entertainment   keep the stupid politics out please  that d be great...as an aside  I was so going to use  pot calling the kettle black  in my post. that about sums the situation up.
love and thunder writer  how can I humiliate more thor in his fourth movie marvel  make female thor more important to the plot and shot a scene with naked male thor.love and thunder writer  great idea! let s do both!
this is what I was concerned about  it being all about jane  who I like and dont mind seeing as a norse God  but turning thor into a joke  makes me not wanna see this as bad. Im still gonna see it and I hope its not thor being turned into a joke the entire time  and I even liked valkyrie but now itseems like she thinks her shit dont stink.
Im a  boomer.  love your channel!!
re  its not respectfulits not supposed to be  it was deliberately written to be disrespectful   disempowering  in this case it was supposedly zeus trying to  get a better look  thor by blowing his coat outer armour off with a flick of his finger.as for wanting to see portman et al like that  I think many of those suggestions are for illustrative purposes  ie it would simply not be allowed   if anyone tried to include it in a script their career would be over.
melonie mac in a sports bra  good lol
as someone who has been gaming since I got an atarI 2600 for Christmas when it released  I am with you on this 100 . I used to wonder if it was  me   but the faster we decline  the more I realize its not just me being old fashioned.
I agree with you about the objectification in that clip being creepy  but  other than that moment  this trailer made the movie look more appealing to me than the previous one did.
let s be real  gentlemen.  when you watch movies like 300  marvel mcu movies  etc  you get into a workout hype.  this is why they had workouts called the spartan warrior workout.  kinobody s  greg o gallagher  modeled some of his workouts to give his clients thatsuperhero physique.  when men saw that reveal of chris hemsworth s physique in the love and thunder trailer  men were not complaining or crying about him being treated like a piece of meat.  its motivation for the men to get into better shape  and its marketing to get women s butts into seat for this movie.mellanie mac looks like she s in good shape  so she wont get hit with what Im about share with you.  whenever a female character is in incredible shape  has insane proportions  like some women cant be genetically blessed or work really hard to maintain those proportions   a lot of women aren t motivated to workout to have a close-to-likeness as these women  but they complain.  these beauty standards are unrealistic.  real women aren t built like that .  you wont have a  victoria s secret  workout or a  lara croft  workout.  instead  women will complain and try to  update it for a modern audience .  there s a twitch streamer that goes by the name of susu jpg who has those lara croft proportions.  tiny little waist and huge breast in proportion to her body but not cartoonish.
I love how melonie says dude she goes deeewd
to your point on the  respect and class  regarding the portrayal of an actor actress - I get the sense you might be talking about the difference between thor with his shirt off in the first movie vs. him literally naked in love and thunder.  the first is tasteful  but gets the point across he s a good looking guy vs. love and thunder seems over the top.
hemsworth has a great sense of humour I think he s init for the laughs! but I do see your argument. double standards is real!
you cant live healtfully only on plant  but you can live healthy only on meat. that made me laugh so hard.
agreed  we need more class.
lets be real we all love looking at attractive bodies  just make it equal and in reasonably good taste  thank you.
this was interesting to watch
great video as always.
personally I agree with your take but when it comes to game character design would like the outfits to be practical or at least fit the character style but then again I love bayonetta so Imight be a hypocrite
I dont mind some degree of sexuality. the double standards are infuriating though. to some degree I wonder if some of it is done to drum up interest for the movies  while another part wonders if certain people just want to divide people up. regardless there does seem to be a lot of people who feel like their values should be respected when they cant even follow their own standards and so many people seem to just go along with it.
yes  moviemakers need to be very careful about how they use nudity. game of thrones was an excellent example of how gratuitous nudity sex scenes cheapened and spoiled the dramatic impact when such scenes were important.
man  I cant tell if those abs are real but they look good.
this!
disagree. he was shirtless for no reason in the first one.
14 00 there was a slew of posts by rainbow flagged folks praising this scene and lusting over chris. it got pretty disturbing to read on twitter.
they just wanted to give the character more muscle and become a handsome icon.they did it for thor too.
and they talk about unrealistic body types for women and yet say jack about the likes of chris hemsworth and laugh at fat thor  disregarding the mental state he was in that lead to his  condition   while pushing fat is beautiful for women.
at the end of the day on social media I see groups of women I know go out to see male strippers and they document the whole night with pictures and pose with the strippers. I never see a men s night out where they post pictures of or even often admit going to s strip bar. I think this is because when women go out to see naked men its just seen as a bit of a laugh but when men do it then its seedy. as far as disney is concerned you would never get this play out the other way around but to be fair perhaps historically in things like say teen comedies such as american pie and other things like that you ll always female nudity. the thing is though that if disney push that its wrong to objectify women constantly then they shouldn t be flipping that on its head  they should be drawing a line in the sand and treating both male and female characters the same. they also wouldn t have had a female character get fat and then mock her and make her character a joke as its not ok to fat shame women but it is to fat shame men.
first thing I noticed ! they would never do this to black widow
I agree  I dont think sexy is a bad thing myself it just depends on the context and the degree. the bigger issue for me is the double standards  even when you think along the lines of if they had asked a woman to do it not only could she have refused but also she could create a shitstorm because she was encouraged to take her clothes off even after she already said she was uncomfortable with that. I dont see that when its reversed.as a man what am I supposed to think  Im wrong or in some way bad for being attracted to woman yet at the same time its perfectly fine acceptable for woman to do it to men. woman can be just as perverted as men are but not everyone are perverts. the way I see it  itshould be the same rules for everyone.Ive always seen lara croft as classy strong and sexy she is much more than just one thing  when I first got the game I was 8 or 9 years old I had a crush on her from the beginning she has even had an effect of the types of girls I went for growing up. the original games where very good the first one is still my favourite. I still have them and they work on my original playstation.considering the people who enforce this woke censorship keep crying for equality seems to me they dont actually want that  its like they are using whatever argument they canto condone their shitty actions to getting whatever they want.sorry for the rant  nice content as always and looking as gorgeous as ever if you ll pardon me for saying so
most of us are saying if that happen to portman  the woke side would raise 7 kind of hell  but chris  thats ok  the guys of at midnight s edge and their all female show on monday nights  toxic feminine  even those girl wasn t thinking it wasn t right
I totally agree nowadays they think that the only way 2 make a box office juggernaut is 2 put nudity in it and it probley  will just keep getting worst
if he was in some impossibly long battle where his outfit was gradually ruined and he just kept fighting covered only in blood and ashes  cool  because then its about the fighting. or if  for story reasons  he s purposely being humiliated by some villian  that might be okay. to just make some cheap excuse to see him naked  though  is lame.
everyone likes sexy people. its just that for some it is a motivation to become better  while others are trying to lower the standards.
let old characters stay the same. make new characters however they want. see which ones are more popular by fans and focus on those because companies will make more money with characters that consumers like.
thanks mel for that verse
would aquaman have made as much if momoa hadn t been shirtless
damn  mel genuinely motivates me to become a better person  and she will never know.
me  an intellectual  both fine.
wow a new record  not sure actually someone can fact check on this one  1 14 into video before I heard the name laura croft and now the world feels right somehow  I guess I just need that daily dose of tomb raider.
every male character in every marvel movie has a lingering shirtless scene-even peter parker who s supposed to be a minor. and this is from disney who had scarlet johansen lecturing everyone on sexualisation of characters! the same company who s viscously attacked any creators or fans who appreciate beautiful female characters in comics. at least even prudes are consistent. but people who constantly complain about the  male gaze  who then apply this huge double standard- are exposing they re only acting out of bitterness and spite rather than any real conviction.
there s a difference between a man with his shirt off and a chick that just wants to wear shorts  childish and brutal reference incoming  its also true!  warning its like watching the hub and they show the man right before ur last stroke
I remember years ago kenner was putting out those figures of a luke skywalker that was built like hulk hogan. anyone who saw the original movies knows well that luke didn t look anything like that. I thought that was a really bad idea because it was totally unrealistic. but  at the same time I think its equally bad when woke people scream that any man who is physically fit or has built muscle is  toxic masculinity.  thats maybe a little off the point but in a way it was a form of objectifying. hollywood is a world of double standards and lectures society for what they do.
I think its because they try to act like a man cant be sexually harassed. pretty common in the workforce these days.
bear in mind  that there is about 0.000  chance that thor s butt will be digitally obscured in the actual movie. meanwhile  scarlet witch cant have cleavage anymore... but she can be an apparently-justified mass murderer.  endgamewastheend boom!
yeah  if zeus had flicked and blew off portman s clothing while being restrained in the same way hensworth got nailed here  there would have been an utter riot on twitter  like  absolute chaos with social justice hypocrites frothing at the mouth.  they d be calling for zeus to be cancelled from olympus.
youre completely right mac
chris is a wonderfull actor and I love his work. but if people keep exploiting him like this noboddy is going too take him serious annymore .
I also dont eat many if at all any fruits or vegetables. unless moms is around... she still wants me to eat them
with the barbie doll  there isn t a problem to give her a shorts  bigger lips  fuller breast  higher heels  tight clothes or whatever. even the jlo doll got bigger thighs and bottom  so...most of the dolls are for children  smaller kids. some of the dolls are for adult collectors  but we can only try to imagine how many of them will be a part of children s collection after. meaning that I really dont know where is the problem about proportions and clothes of lara croft  the game is for older people  or even for adults and why there are that ridiculous things  like a sexualism  seriously  really  I think that lara could be a great character for a cartoon movie  for a real action  for a more mature game  or a game for children  or even as a series of a toys like an adventurer in a type of disney character. we got revisioned  there were a few different sides of lara  but everytime she was matches with her style  heritage  her style of life  and she is elastic  but she is herself  definitely the same. and look at warrior mulan  who took the bath as nude with her compans  she had a weapons and whatever what she wore  she was herself as well. let to lara to be herself too  with her true foundation  classic legacy  like the many other characters  kratos  nathan drake  joel  esteban with his team from the mysterious city of gold or mickey mouse. lara can developing  or will getting a fuller character  she can wear many of styles  but she is enough adult and complete to know how she is  what she likes and what describes her and even if she will change her point of view it will be a next part of her life  but it will be still about her  not about alternative variation of someone similar to her.
I say if youre going to have fanservice  let itswing both ways. and I am sick of hbo and other streaming services portraying sex as a tasteless  classless  lurid transaction of fluids.
if the actor or actress is ok being nude in a movie or media platform  then I dont think there is anything wrong with it. what I have a problem with if the actor or actress is misled about their nude scene or pressured to do it. that pisses me off. for example  I did a nude scene in the movie zola. I was told it was gonna be done a certain way. then when I get on set  it was done differently. and when I asked to speak to the director about it  I was told she was really busy. so I couldn t voice an objection. then Imentioned to the handler  who came back to me stating I could back out but wouldn t be paid anything for my time. so since I was already waiting there for several hours  I did the nude scene. they didnt use my face however since they could tell from my facial expressions  I wasn t happy. thats the problem with most filmmakers  they treat most talent as meat. and asked if I would do another nude scene in a movie  I would have them state in writing that I am paid for my time whether or not the nude scene happens. that way  if I am misled  I can back out still getting paid.
hey mel  its not just the double standard  its the way in which thor ends up naked. he s forcibly stripped of his garb while his friends just sit there eating grapes. mocking male victims of sexual assault while ruining their empowered female heroes.
if this was natalie portman in thatscene stripped naked  the outcry from the left would be insane.
5 52 - it was never God s intention for sex and romance to become the casual toys  essentially  that they have. the fact that two people  no matter the sex  cant express a deep bond with each other without being labeled as a couple or sleeping together  or as I like to call it  the death of the concept of friendship  is incredibly sad. only adult children think this way...
dont worry  chris wasn t exploited. I was his ass double.  p
speaking about shower scenes  have you seen starship troopers
I agree with you   on this topic  continue the great work lovable melonie  one  more thing  I really really love the new halo series and Im a huge halo fan the only things didn t like was the kwan ha stuff. I also love cortana in the halo tv series she s so cute and beautiful
didn t know you had endo  I have friends who ve got it  shitseems rough
exactly and another great video
honestly  Im curious as to how a morbidly obese lara croft would go on adventures. just imagine  600 lbs of lara trying to run away from a boulder  but she trips and rolls down like a boulder herself  crushing the bad guys lol!
6 59 what s funny is that porn is probably the only place you d see a woman in the same position. when its a woman people get mad at waaay less.
I dont like the original tr movie  I nitpick it almost as much as the current games  but at least its better. but thatshower scene  unneeded as it was  I see it as one way of showing lara croft as  beautiful and does not give  af if you think so or not. she just is.  the  a lady should be modest  line also hammers her priorities  though I think classic lc would care about modesty and being lady like. but it tells us her lady status comes second to her  the adventure is priority to her.
there is a double standard. personally  I dont see a problem with nudity.
dont forget captain carter getting her  proportions  toned down in dr.strange 2
@victor von doom  I dont doubt that  although to be fair  hayley atwell has slimmed down considerably while getting toned for her upcoming role in mission impossible  so that might have something to do with it as well. however  that just makes me more adamant than ever that hayley should be the next live-action lara croft! she s fit and busty and  well  perfect!
@before movies sucked!  go back and watch thatscene bro she s flatter than rey in that movie
cringe
if you want to treat men and women equal  you have to actually treat them equal. I know itsounds crazy but hollywood  it just might work. melonie s natural hair for the win.
I only saw the 2011 thor.  it was majestic.  it got me into the norse mythology.  the following ones appear goofy.  this one as well.  I skipped those and I will skip this one.  the naked thor will be just that  goofy.  Im not opposed to humor.  but I like my super heroes to be serious in their business.  I need to feel the consequences.
two songs dont make a right   but hollywood seems to think it does in every case
not to be nit-picky but I do think you probably should have watched the trailer to get more context on the scene before making this video. it might have maybe made a few of you opinions of that pic change a little. maybe.do not get me wrong. I do agree with most of what you are saying here.butI am just suggesting that you should have watched the scene first because the scene was actually fluid and organic to what was going on in the short clip that we had.I cant say how you would have viewed that clip but personally I found the whole joke   comedy aspect of thatscene hilarious and I think it worked well.again I am not disagreeing with mostly what you said in this video. I just think watching it first would have been a good idea.
you make a very fair case you in my opinion.
I thought the thor scene looked funny as hell. just make it equal. edit  just dont throw a fit when it happens both ways. I do think they are over-doing the sexualization though. every show doesnt have to be game of thrones.edit 2  woah... didn t realize hepworth was coerced into it. its one thing to sign on to a role knowing that that was a required part for the movie  but he s established as the character  and they should not have done that.
I dont mind the standard so long asa  they are up front with the actor - before they sign the contract  they must clearly understand what is expected. chris has to fast from water for so long for topless shots he is in danger of passing out. I think mostly they should be prevented from doing that. I also hate the starving of female actresses. its stupid because it is not even how most men want their women to look.b  the same standard applies across the board. natalie s not as hot as chris  frankly  although she was very appealing when she was young. so having some fan service for the men  well  who would you use because none of the women in marvel movies now are terribly attractive  they got rid of everyone men actually wanted. if I was making movies  I would want fan service because itsells tickets. if you look at carrie fisher for star wars  she did some very sexy promo shots  and the outfits she sometimes wore were suggestive  and she was sexually aggressive at times. thus  even though no nudity is there  sexuality is still appealed to  and I think that is important.
amen!!
I completely agree. its like   hey m women have been so objectified and sexualized for so long  what can we do to fix this  oh yes  let s exploit the men now! that will make things totally even and get our point across.   no. so I have to say  I think chris hemsworth is gorgeous. thor has been my favorite avenger from the beginning  which I feel like a lot of people started jumping on the thor bandwagon after he pretty much stole the show in infinity war  but that is another matter entirely  and he is kind of my ideal man  long hair  goatee  very muscular  but even I say thatscene was simply uncalled for. Imean you let that have been natalie portman or tessa thompson up there chained and naked. people would have gone ape crap.also  I saw the movie yesterday  and for some reason  they saw fit to mention the word  orgy  like 5 times in this scene. disgusting.
when itstarts to look like porn you ve gone too far. porn itself is too far  so dont go there. being prude is something to be proud of.
for me I understand if you watch the old transformers trilogy especially when shia leboaf went to college and every female was basically a pornstar and thats wrong but its also wrong to toss that character out in its entirety and people tear japan apart for fanservice but to me its a non issue
the trailer was better than the teaser. but thats similar to saying the cleveland browns are better than the detroit lions.
I recall some outrage over fat thor in endgame. whatever happened to body positivity
lara croft can wear what she wants but Im opposed to shorts not because skin bothers me in the slightest but because the last time I skinned my knee was when I was like 12 and I dont want that for anyone else ever  and just thinking about the wounds you d get in a tomb no thank you  imo.
@1 30  all things in moderation.   -- hesiod
youre not far off base. things have just gotten to the point where sexuality is overstated.
russell crowe blows thors clothes off  they cheer!russell crowe blows janes clothes off  stop objectifying her!what would ve just been a funny moment 20 years ago is now a bloody middle finger to non woke culture i.e people capable of critical thinking.its honestly like they think the first thing all men do it he second a female character gets stripped down is immediately get it out and perform  self care  when most of us are mature enough to keep those under control
some times in rpg s I like the female character lol and yes Imiss the old school lara croft and disney going non pg hmm never knew this nutritional thing maybe I should being diabetic
there is a difference between a sexy character and a sexualized one   think of cat woman   she is sexy and definitely uses that to her advantage   seducing people    tricking them  etc.  this is an important part of her character. did you see her naked though  no   its not necessary   to me striping characters naked means you have no story worth telling so you are selling bodies instead   honestly its messed up. I like the fact that thor came back to be fit  this makes sense he is a God and a fighter but thatscene is just part of this thirst culture that is being pushed everywhere.
mary sue s in these new disney ran movies get to have both men being dumb and getting to freely gawk at the men who are attractive like  ooo yeah this what you did to women for years so now we re doing to you!
agreed. lara croft is a sexy character as well  not sexualized.
I totally get what youre saying but in regards to comic mediums  sexuality is a tool a lot of characters like black widow  green arrow  black canary etc. use. I agree this is absolutely the wrong way to do it and the double standard baffles my brain
its definitely a two-fold issue 1. there is a double standard now where men can be freely exploited for sexual appeal but women cant  according to many companies.2. in general  there is too much of push for sexual exploitation. Imiss the days where there was some restraint and class. if all your product has is sexual appeal  its probably not a good product.lara croft wearing those tight shorts is definitely nice  but the games themselves were really fun and exciting regardless.
17 52 I bet we was referring to nikocado
looking so beautiful melonie!
the woke weirdos would be losing their tiny minds if a straight director had forced an actress to do a scene she wasn t comfortable with
lastly I want to add  if this was magI c mike 3  and hemsworth was playing a stripper I wouldn t have any issue with him being nude or being objectified.  its escapism  and its for an adult audience  a little lust and objectification is okay.
simply put  sexism makes the consequences of being objectified different for men and women so the reactions to the objectification follow those different paths.
I like how your dressed lol. is that lara croft on youre arm
I like how worlds are truly backwards through out decades the american 2000s  male character s naked  good   female character s naked  badthe americantoday  male character s naked  good   female character s naked  badthe japan 2000s  male character s naked  bad   female character s naked  goodthe americantoday  male character s naked  good   female character s naked  goodwe westerners are crapping on male characters and keep females some sacred cows in walmart of the world  where japan lewds both genders in anima manga like no tomorrow  let thatsink in . . .
I dont have a problem with bringing sex appeal to movies  the problem I have with this scene though is that it was done to humiliate a men.
chris is worth 130 million dollars  I dont think he needs the money. though it must be nice to get some more though.   I really miss the 80 s when we had awesome movies like conan the barbarian and the beast master.  men and woman half naked and kicking ass! no one cared back then. I know  I grew up  in those times. youreally should see the trailer  it was a kinda funny joke. just seeing a still image not well informed. I dont think its is bad as what itseems.
as incredulous as you are  consent needs to be a bright line issue. how do you distinguish between  pressuring  and a request that the person assumes is non-negotiable  what level of uncomfortable is acceptable vs non-consensual  outside of your life is being threatened or some extreme case like that  then we need some accountability for the people who are consenting  yes  consenting  to do things
sometimes the best thing to do is let be and let God
so very true! thank you for covering this! I saw the scene in the trailer and kept thinking   why is this needed or why is this a thing   I dont like this objectification and pervertedness.
we are talking about women  double standards is almost all they have.
the amount of comments that Ive seen about how redhood is too ugly in gotham knights is crazy. I thought people wanted ugly characters so they could identify with them
if an actress or a female model  stated thatshe was not a piece of meat  but hollywood filmmakers  marketers  promoters or photographers  tell her  point blank to her face  that  yes  you are a piece of meat  meant to entertain people   the woke world would explode  with angry accusations of sexism  misogyny  chauvinism  and so on  against the entertainment industry. but  apparently  its okay for chris hemsworth  to be a  piece of meat   at least  according to taika waititi.
nudity in films  I respond the same when it comes to horror films. if there is violence for the sake of violence that has no reason or purpose to the story  its a waste of my time  cheaps the story and moral question the director  why....did that need to be there other than be mean or take advantage
I remember when thor the dark world came out and hemsworth was reported to have been annoyed because the director wanted to have an extended scene of him wet and shirtless but now its ok because its in a humorous context!! objectification is totally fine.................as long its a dude....and  funny  I guess
well  chris hemsworth had to take steroids because you gain muscle faster for the role. takes longer naturally.
Im all for showing sexy characters but it cant be hypocrisy the entire time. imagine the outrage if they did thatsame scene with natalie portman  it would have been a shitshow everywhere.
we can blame radfems for the double standard of them not wanting to be objectified but being ok to humiliate men at every corner and or be objectified.
commenting to feed the algorithm
the thor scene is made worse by the reactions and comments by the women in the crowd witnessing this. they are allowed to act and say whatever they want because nobody is allowed to call out a womans bad behaviour. if this sort of scene happened outside of anywhere but a fred olen ray movie  there would have been a very hard point made that the way the men responded was vile and toxic and then the lecture about how all women are objectified.
have no issues with this as I dont with womenmoreover it was funny
and yet almost every female  streamer  wears as little clothes as possible. if you are so against it wear actual clothes you would wear in front of your grandparents
it may be percy to have natalie do a scene similar to it. idgaf. fair is fair. if you are going to do it to one person because he s a man then do it to a woman as well.
is that gojira tattooed on her right bicep or am I seeing what I want to see.
if you have chris hemsworth naked and natalie portman clothed  the solution is not to make natalie portman naked  although I would have no objection to that ...its to put clothes on chris hemsworth. there s nothing wrong with sexuality in a movie  so long as its not gratuitous--there just to be there. take historical dramas for example. kings needed heirs  queens and princesses used their bodies to gain political power. there was all that evil politics  and sex was a big part of that  no pun intended . so it belongs there in that context. but you cantell when its being done cheaply just for kicks.
been saying this for years. like how he was cast in ghostbusters  as the dumb eye candy  for the women to mock.
I dont like to comment but every human body is a little different. some people respond well without carbs and some respond well with only carbs. others are balanced and others are somewhere between.
Im not sure that is even his real body. the whole scene aside from his face looks a little cg and uncanny valley  his body included. it doesnt make it that much better  but if it is cg  at least he was comfortable filming the scene.also antinutrients aren t that much of a concern if you maintain healthy gut bacteria and produce the enzymes necessary to digest plants. one thing about diets  is there isn t a one size fits all  depending on your genetics and lifestyle  you will produce a different blend of enzymes from someone else. you can get a rough idea of what kinds of enzymes you produce by letting a little saliva build up after you eat and then gently move it over though your teeth and see what food naturally pops out first and what pops out last. gut bacteria are super important though  they help protect from antinutrients  indigestible material build up  toxins and pathogens whether you are eating plants  meat or both
can you imagine it had been a woman  you could hear the out cry in the middle of the brazilian jungle. a scene like this doesnt add anything to the movie because its just shoehorned  in makes no sense. if itsupported the story somehow then fine but this is anything but that  I believe you comment is correct where has the class went. well said.
taika literally called hemsworth a  piece of meat.  if only you neckbeards had the guts to not see this movie.
I will say this. marvel  dc  or any other comic company can be for us adults but ultimately its really for the children. nudity does not belong in these movies.
its an interesting problem.  I have long been against the concept of pretty privilege. the most beautiful people rule the world in ways that are just absurd.  when I was growing up  I was told I was not attractive. as a male  this was because I was skinny  and not beefy.  so what was a kid to do  I started working out.  and I became muscular. and I became attractive. and I noticed people would go out of their way to talk to me.  I noticed I got promotions easier.  I noticed women would ask me out  attractive women  women I wanted. in fact  usually  the  prettiest  woman in the room so to speak became my type. and I noticed what it was like to be a  playboy  or whatever term you use today  and how women would let you treat them terribly because you were attractive.and then I look at hollywood.  and I look at celebrities.  and I looked at my friends  even my own family  my lovers  coworkers  bosses.  I noticed every single person treated me better when I was attactive  and terrible when I was less attractive  or rather   not the ideal man .  so Ive been on both sides of this.  Ive been the  nice guy  and Ive been the  fuck boy jerk .and I still say  even while Im reaping the benefits  that pretty privilege is at the end of the day  bad for our society as a whole.  we shouldn t be putting so much emphasis on how people look. itshouldnt matter nearly as much as the skills they have. soldiers should make more than beauty pagent celebrities.but heres the thing. while Im against this sort of  beautiful bias  that our culture is obsessed with  I also dont want them to just erase all things attractive.  because heres the difference.when I say it  Imean I want society to stop worshipping pretty people and to stop giving them free passes in life.  women on onlyfans making millions from their fucking bath water just for not over eating. and men who get the promotions  100k a year  almost entirely because they were more attractive than jeremy who was more qualified but not charismatic enough to win the promotion.its just a joke man. the whole system is a joke. and I can say that  from a position of the beneficiary. but look  when they say lets erase attractive women from video games  what they are doing is making it one sided.  they want to erase only the pretty people that  lets say  republicans for example  are interested in.  they sure wont be erasing like  black beauty queens  they wont be erasing  lgbtq beauty icons.  in fact  I see it all the time the same people trying to erase hot white bitches are simultaneously worshipping dark queens and lgbtq petites. just look at the britney spears coverage vs the hilary duff coverage.  one represents freedom  the other represents drug abuse.  you can see the standards being worshipped.so. I dont know. I think we do need to stop putting so much emphasis on hot actors and shit like that. stop giving people promotions for being attractive.  stop playing favorites  stop treating ugly people like garbage  stop calling itsexual harassment when hes fat  but when hes a chad its called harmless flirting.  I actually tested this one time at work. she actually gave me her number even after I explained that it was just an experiment.  Imean  yeah  I fucked her later  but thats besides the point.  my point is this.  pretty privilege needs to be destroyed. but we cant let politics target the values we erase.  they will only erase your values and not theirs. do not let them cancel sexyness. they should cancel sexy privilege. its ok to find someone attractive  but they shouldn t be getting a free pass through life because of it.  notice how they try to make video games less sexy  but then worship naked women on twitch. thats the problem.and yeah  the reason that male sexyness isnt being erased is because its the fat pig sjw s behind the computer screens in charge of this cancel culture shit.  news flash.  we dont want to fuck you piglets.
something that has always bothered me about the clothes thing is that men are completely covered and virtually featureless  whereas women are often scanty and you get to see thatshe s a person and not a golem.  I think there s not a lot of people that notice that.
mel go fine-boom!
Im sure chris hemsworth and other actors that work hard to get perfect bodies dont mind at all showing themselves off and getting paid very well for it. it is double standards but male actors have been stripping off in mainstream films since the 1970s. if the story fits the role for both male and female actors stripping off then itshould continue in rated r content  but this thor film naked scene was just ridiculous and specifically shown to younger eyes and minds. the shower scene in tomb raider was hot  what was so pervy about a 20 sec scene that didn t show anything  if anything the proceeding towel walk was more suggestive showing off some stylish side boob. again tame.
I love me some porn but I do agree we dont need nudity in every Goddamn thing.
I shall also do this
me three!
first!!!

thanks for bravely sharing Bible verses at the end of your episodes in this day and age. I read along in my Bible  the wording was slightly different in my translation  but the meaning was the same. its despicable that waititI for to refer to hemsworth as a piece of meat and pressure him to do what something wasn t comfortable with. I dont know what hemsworth s contract stipulates  but I wouldn t be terribly surprised if he doesnt want to work with waititI when the contract ends. I dont think anyone  man or woman  should be pressured to do something they feel uncomfortable with  especially something that leaves them so vulnerable.
at least love and thunder is considered one of the worst mcu movies and didn t make a lot of money compared to others
I think waititI humor went over ur head. thats his style of humor  it was sarcasm
love the content about the gender hypocrisy its so true  and the fact that chris perhaps didnt want to do it is a little weird  add to that the workout he did compared to portman not being sexualised and if rumours are true cgI arms seems that ladies are getting a free pass.  however I turned off a vegan rant  quit preaching.
getting gratification of someone whos uncomfortable is wrong and sickening...
Ive hated this double standard for so long.no woman can be sexy attractive in western media anymore but every male actor  or at least all the ones that have protagonist roles  practically has to have at least one scene per movie where they re shirtless for no reason other than so women can drool over them and thats apparently acceptable.you can have men and women be attractive sexy in media without them being objectified. you dont have to have everyone cover up but you also dont need everyone have a shirtless shower sex etc scene just so people can get their creepy kicks.its insane that women drooling over people like hemsworth is seen as okay but if it was men drooling over a woman then its creepy and toxic. they re both creepy.
the fact that you are not one sided just says you put thought into your beliefs. sadly the left has made it that the right gone to the extreme deep end. I know people find that bizarre idea to put blame on the left. however if this wasn t the case. how did they end up dominating the entertainment industry  how does most their policies such as abortion  affirmative action and more get passed without much resistance when it comes to politics  how come is it all the top corporations stand at attention when the twitter woke mob gets riled up  its because the right turned the other cheek for decades and now they have had enough. this is how we now have this era of crazy politics. Im just glad to see in the comment section there are so many with common sense. gives me some comfort to think at some point we eventually will bounce back from this nonsense...... hopefully.
hope you dont forget on the arnold schwarzenegger movies especially Im terminator when he first comes at the terminator he always walk around naked and dont forget chris hemsworth is been treated as a piece of meat and let me see and the men in black international
why do we have to see everyone naked   because chris hemsworth worked hard to look like that and he deserves to show it off   and I find it motivating  inspiring even. not just because he looks amazing  but I like it when men are seen as pieces of meat  too often we re just seen as objects  as utilities  to the point where it feels like we re completely undesirable. so watching women salivate over a naked man just makes me feel good  it makes me feel like Im not just some robot but an actual human being. most people wouldn t want to be exploited in that way   well I for one certainly do. and the times in my life that Ive felt like that are among my most fond memories.
my only answer to actors not being  treated like pieces of meat .  we live in a country with  at will employment . nobody can make you do a job you do not want to do. if you accept a job  well you can also quit it. those thatsay what about breaking contracts. to that I say then your morals are already compromised. you accepted the job you singed a contract. you have obligations now. either fulfill the contract or  just break it and pay the consequences that you agreed to.
scantily clad heroes on screen are 100  fine  feminists need to end the double-standard.there s also no merit to the  piece of meat  treatment of one sex because there are always alternatives in every moment of time  pending the story and direction - its up to the artist and the character and the characters personality.the story characters are designed as intended. sexy be sexy and whining is simply jealousy.let the fantasy story be.
17 35 thats also not true. if you only consume meat you ll also suffer from deficiancy symptoms in the same way vegans suffer from similar issues.humans are omnivores. we are not herbivores and we are not carnivores either. thats just how the human metabolism works.itshould be said though that throughout most of humanity s evolution the primary source of food was meat  not plants. this only changed with the rise of agriculture over the last few thousand years  but even now the consumption of both sources of food is important to our health.
I had this conversation with my friends this evening and I feel that all this is sooooo hypocrite and Im tried of this and Im tired about everything is offensive anymore...I cant be offensive as a human about any fantasy world or movie or game I just cant its just fiction and its okay being sexy or strong or anything anyone could think about.... you dont like what you are watching   nobody force anyone to watch or play any game !! this is everyone s choice so I cant understand how can someone see something upset him enough to deal with it and be in the phase that the world have to change and etc bla bla bla and all this has results to no longer have interesting woman characters anymore in both movies and games they have downgrade any woman characters in the last years even how they are dressed has become boring and cynical that  really piss me off but on the contrary men have every privilege to be sexy cool without nobody talking about it
I find it immensely hypocritical for women to complain about sexism when many of these same women parade themselves as meat on twitch  only fans  and other websites. I find it even worse that these same women are being handed money by individuals who stole their parents credit cards. if a minor takes a parents credit card and gives these women money that is the fault of the streamer. garden tools are hypocrites.
thank you
I got just as uncomfortable seeing them do this to thor as I get when I see a woman objectified in a movie.   you are right  this is such double standard  and I feel so bad for chris hemsworth!  this single scene has just completely put me off of seeing the movie.
wish the world had your common sense! be glad you didn t waste money seeing thor  love and thunder. hemworth s backside was one of the least of the problems. terrible shifts of tone between comedy and adventure. Christian bale was pretty much wasted. the thor movies have been my favorites but at the end of the movie they just had to insert a scene promoting woke bull I love going to the cinema but all the unnecessary pc is gonna make my wallet fatter cause I see no reason to go out of my way to be offended. seems like hemsworth would have had enough clout to not film the nude scene. it was completely superfluous  happy halloween!
this last scene in thor 4 trailer proved how hypocritical marvel is...
youre talking one scene  probably  in a movie as compared to an entire game franchise which sexualized its main character the entire time
I think martin freeman should be he next black
they sexualize thor in every movie this time they were more blatant with it there s literally a line from agents of shield where they re talking about thor being hot felt him up in infinity war while unconscious constant random unnecessary topless scenes etc Im tired of hearing its wrong with women but excusable when its a man make up your minds
@mad dog gamer  I think they shadowbanned the comment bro you might wanna retype it
lara has never been clotheless in any of the games. I would know. stop with the strawmanning.are you gonna walk up to girls irl wearing booty shorts and tell them is wrong  I thought so.
@victor von doom  youtube hates me as much as alex jones. Im used to it. thanks for the heads up.
@mad dog gamer  same Im getting sick of their bs
@victor von doom  wasn t that the reason why you built your own country away from this bs
@mad dog gamer  what  there s a scene of teenage lara taking off her shirt in tr chronicles
@underthegun897  ohhhh the humanity!!!
@mad dog gamer  so you were wrong
@underthegun897  taking off her shirt doesnt equal completely clotheless soooo nope
I never thought I would hear you say that you think people should cut out vegetables from their diet   seeing how the Bible says in gen 1.29   and God said  behold  I have given you every herb bearing seed  which is upon the face of all the earth  and every tree  in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed  to you itshall be for meat.  . of course modified food or veggies should be avoided but I never heard of fruits and vegetables having antI nutrients. lets not forget how many plants and fruits can help with things such as digestion  blood pressure  immune system etc. and what the pharma industry would like you to never know is what certain seeds   such as raw apricot seeds can do to cancer.  o noes! the seeds have a compound called amygdalin  which is an enzyme that your gut turns into cyanide    but what they dont say is that particular form of cyanide attacks cancer. you should not consume too much though... of anything. if you wanna eat fruits and veggies that wont hurt you  eat organic . that way you wont likely consume the round up pesticide many farms put on their crops.
everybody just needs to chill.
hahahaha God s where
taika waititI has issues.
hold the phone!! so you are saying that we the lonely old viewer can not object-o-fy the ladies   hello ladies  jk  but!!! can ooooooogle the man folk     how is this fair  !  ! ! ! Imean equalness  am I right
fuck I need to hit up the gym

classic rules for thee versus rules for me
I would like the samething happen to natalie portman too.honestly I think you took the wrong approach topic to this subject  shouldve used something like mk11 as example where the woman are pretty censored  too much amount of clothing  only 2 woman have sexy skins and its just sports bra and leggings  not even bikinis. compared to pretty much every male character having a shirtless skin.nothing s wrong with the clothed skins  alot of them look cool but why the f ck do all the men have sexualised appealing outfits when the woman dont  also with the b.s comment they made  pssh well showing skin is unrealistic in fights brawls  even tho its a game so should be  woman wearing heels in fights  and its the other way around  less clothing is better so not much grip
I thought the joke was hilarious.
melonie! fan request from finland  please do a crossover with angry video game nerd from cinemassacre. angry video game nerd vs gamer girl talking about tomb raider! why not  have you seen this video https   www.youtube.com watch v 3oqktia7nli
quoting the old quote if the left didnt have double standars  they wont ha e standars at all
mmgb
should start a petition to have the naked thor scene removed from the movie.
boom!!!
heeey  suns out guns out am I right.
why is it that a man can walk about topless but a woman can not
the f-ck. you have abs
nah fam I think both should be totally okay. sexualization doesnt mean degredation. or shouldnt. however we all know what it is when someone who doesnt want something gets pressed to do it anyways.not right.
fo real
chris is just a vibe and only a good actor as the script he is given. he by all means sold out to provide his family with enough money to live in this world by materialism standards. hollywood execs dont see anything but dollor signs and could care less if you bare your soul for a role. certain actors like Christian bale who have done all genres are respected even if their behaviour at times is questionable.the artwork they are in needs talent and some dont have any at all beyond the way they look.
class   in hollywood   hah!
it looks a bit humiliating.
tbh when I saw the pictures my eyes just diverted from them. I love good-looking men  but this was
what are you saying  I still dont know your stance. its ok sorta  you think he s uncomfortable but Im sure thatscene wouldn t exist if he didn t want to. and that tika interview he was joking genius
I  for one  am horrified when I see female fans treat jason momoa as nothing bu a piece of fish.   just kidding  I actually admire his physique and am not threatened by any man s body until unless they succeed at taking my wife from me.  then they suck and should wear bulky  oversized sweatshirts.
I just dont like their double standard...let us have sexy females or dudes.
the reality is sexualizing the opposite sex is normal its something we humans do  there can be such a thing as going overboard with it and going overboard in and of itself is bad  in general its fine and natural.
the last part  ffnen the video does not have anything to doch with the topic
sounds like some of these karens never played postal 2. give it a play and then think about how it makes you feel.
I am with you 100   current media does not women to even look like women but often men are treated like meat in the case of thor in thatscene. I loved first thor movies but I will not be watching this hot garbage.
male gaze bad female gaze good
and another thing about that thor trailer is also that thor is bound naked  so if that would have been a woman these same people extremist modern crazy feminists would have called itsexual violence against women  and insinuated rape and shit  or some sick pervert men fetish  or the like.
lol kinda weird how he s tied up... kinda looks against his will  not much of a power fantasy huh if this was done to a woman everyone would absolutely lose their mind  very tasteful disney.I dont have a strong opinion one way or the other but Im all for some sexy characters but itshould kind of fit the story.
you should read verses from revelations and try to give your best interpretation.
I like the lara croft reboot version in the first game. after they replaced her again and actually made her ugly  that got annoying. idky the fuck they wont give her akimbo pistols though.
its not a double standard  its a different standard... theres a difference  sex sells and companies will push the limits as far as possible in order to promote. if you wanna talk about a double standard  y all not ready for the double standards against men in modern society... thatshit would make you cry what men have to go through compared to women  now those are double standards. this is just silly
comments on having eggs as a big source of protein  not primary  they re just cheap and easy to make in lots of ways
if they do if for a woman then they should do it for a man too.
objectifying chris hemsworth and henry cavil good  objectifying scarlet johanson and elizabeth olson bad. shirtless men are ok  but bra and bikinI women are problematic  thats the society we live in! sigh.
this was bad. it just felt off for some reason
there s definitely a double standard  but I think youre being too puritanical when even a shower scene is a problem for you. but thats you. you can have that opinion. mine is thatsexualization is generally okay. part of the power fantasy is the sexual element.that being said  I do find hollywood cringe and extremely weird. the way they talk makes me want to vomit. I think their whole culture is gross af.
Im fine with the  piece of meat  treatment. just dont be dishonest about it
hey good late afternoon melonie hope you had a great day today at home and hope you are doing well with yourself too. anyway I just want to tell you that I am 100  with you on this topic bc being nude is not a good thing to have in any movies and tv shows bc it is wrong and I rather see a movies and tv shows that has actress and actors being in clothes instead of being nude and being naked in movies and tv shows  ok melonie. anyway I do hope you agree with me on this topic and I just want to tell you that being nude or naked in movies and on tv shows should not be tolerated and they should change the way how they make movies and tv shows more interesting and enjoyable to see and watch  ok melonie. anyway I hope you had a great day today at home and I hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
I d say its all bad
its mostly feminist makind the noise so of cousre they will want good looking men in movies and be bitter over any other women
u can mess up God s plan 4 you r self if you r not listening 2 him though
Bible verses ! ...Im surprised   was sure she was atheist ...
and think kids r going 2b watching this
there are ma
wait... antI nutrients  gotta hit up sister google
if your not antI censorship then you deserve to be censored. people who have been censored for opinions and then go out and promote censorship are just as bad as the puritans. I have np with sexualization of fictional characters if people do maybe the show is not for them and dont watch it. you should be able to wear what you want creators should create what they want. people who attack you for what you wear are just wrong as people who support censorship. everyone can have a opinion I just wont support anyone who supports censorship thats mine.
so youre against woke hollywood demonizing hyper masculinity and hyper femininity  but also against the  sex sells  approach
I can not fault your logic or conclusions.and that kinda sucks.
now brendan frasier in george of the jungle in a butt flap... Im game. but chris hemsworth nakie and tied down  yummy!
this stuff is unreal at least give chris some skivvies for God sakes  it is our fault that actors and actresses are this way we put too much unnecessary pressure for them to perform they did not ask to be idolized be down in a lot of these actors and actresses they have broken souls just look at johnny depp see how broken he is more examples hollywood is the definition of exploitation there s not a line that they re not willing to cross mark my words mental health its going to be a hot-button issue for a couple hundred years this is the human condition that we have to deal with we made our bed we have to lay in it
I am in full agreement on the sex thing . hollywood has no self respect
I dont understand your view here you kinda contradict yourself. I personally think this scene is supposed to be funny. men being naked has been a haha funny moment in movies for a looong time. happens to women too but not as often.
ok
meh
not only is it creepy and exploitive  but its also bad writing.  stories  that are nothing but sex and violence are lame and boring. also  I think subtle is more sexy. I d rather see a woman in a cotton dress than a bikini.
what  when has buff people and women being naked ever been funny    it was so blatantly obviously what they were trying to do and thats why its hard to respect
I wont agree with you about cutting fruits and vegetables out of your diet.  thats just bullshit on a level I dont want to think of.
melanie mac you are a prude.
but objectification is what the industry sells  no  even music industry too. fashion industry even more.if one is working in that industry  he she already gave consent for whatever it is as long as within the contract  right  if one is uncomfortable  he she should quit the industry.
props to helmsworth for doing the work  but I prefer women. luckily there are way more female action movie fans than male ones  so it wont hurt the producers bottom line one bit.
no  she denounces the hypocritical double standards of modern feminists.
