Im sick of all the cow farts argument too  its all just asinine...  I see what you did there
I had my own struggles in my teens when I stopped eating meat. I ll always be angry about how stupid I was and fell for what people were saying on the internet so quickly because I was desperate and wanted to be really skinny lol I have endocrine system problems now  I have to take medicine for my thyroid. Im thankful I did snap out of it. my diet is protein and fat heavy and I feel better and Im really crossing my fingers that my thyroid can heal ps Imade the protein waffles you shared on twitter I think it was  just eggs and protein powder  sooooo good omg
its ok  mel. no need to feel embarrsed over mistakes. sometimes we have to screw up in order to learn! thats what I tell my students whenever Im subbing. love your hair by the way!
I have seen so many people in the long term turn into skeletons have less energy and just an overall different person after doing this and not in a good way they seem more tired now and not do  things this is my experience keep up the great content keep talking about things you enjoy such as this
really loving the video. very informative. Ive been trying to do carnivore more my self and exercising more frequent. if Imove to texas  I need to hire you as my trainer nutritionist. anyways much love and as always I continue to pray for you.
I love that you said you ve become a bit of a conspiracy theorist because of how we have been lied to about nutrition - Im exactly the same.  I usually say its one of the many things that  red pilled  me.   lolit wasn t till I found keto a few years ago that I finally found a way of eating that actually helped me improve my health  sleep better  have more energy  think clearer and lose weight.  I now do carnivore because I find it much easier to do than keto and its just as effective - maybe even better.Im 52 and think back to the past 40 years of trying to lose weight and going through all the lies we have been given by the government.  low fat diets based on nothing more than if you eat fat you become fat  such bs .  lies about cholesterol being bad for you.  nothing had any positive effects on my life till I tried a very low carb  keto  diet and now I feel even better on a zero carb  carnivore  diet.  Im still losing weight and feeling better every day.  my current weight is one I haven t seen since the 90s.one of the most important things Ive learned though is you dont lose weight to get healthy  you have to get healthy to lose weight.
my ex became vegan while we were dating. she is a professional horse trainer  she s very active  she lasted about 2 years. she was down to about 90lbs at 5 6  and constantly exhausted. she started eating fish  eggs and milk and immediately got better.
haven t even watched it yet and I agree 1000  with just the title alone.
glad I found your channel melonie  Ive subscribed. I totally agree with you  Ive been a carnivore all my life and Im 50. feel the same as I did in my 20s
I always value your nutrition   health advice mel!
to see the negative outcomes of a vegan diet  just look at robert downey jr. he started 2 years ago and looks like he aged 30 years. loose odd colored skin  gaunt face  almost zero muscle mass  its heart breaking to see how much he has physically changed in 2 years.
love ur videos especially when they are about tomb raider! I was vegan for 2 1 2 years and had to switch to vegitarian because I couldn t gain weight. I was having to avoid so much food because it had a dairy ingredient or meat so switched to vegitarian. being vegan and vegetarian iv constantly tested deficient in b12  essential fatty acids  vitamin c  vitamin a  vitamin e  and amino acids. not saying my diet was correct when vegan and vegetarian but iv constantly and consistently had to take different supplements. it can be a difficult balance. even many people iv known who eat meat received blood results of b vitamins deficiency.
great video melonie. Ive been trying to share some of dr. berry s content with family and its very hard to not get pushy with them  lol. my father is pre-diabetic and my brother in law is one of those diabetics that is like  Im gonna eat what makes me happy  and doesnt care. any advice
I gave the keto paleo diet a try back in early february after watching your video and never looked back.  Ive lost 32 lbs with minimal effort.  cutting out sugar completely  and severely reducing my carb intake has been world changing.  thanks for giving me the kick I needed to get my health back in order.
my brother is a vegan and now he seems geriatric and has some kind of neurological problems even though he isn t old.
been on carnivore for a little bit  I hope at some point the restaurants treat us the same as vegan. I just cant trust them and cooking at home is easy enough. even some places like a steak house should be adding no sugar keto options  its so easy.
Im doing carnivore and usually just eat twice a day but once or twice a week I only eat one time during the day.  for those who haven t done keto or carnivore they may not fully understand what we are saying.  we aren t putting in effort to limit ourselves to eating only once or twice a day  it just happens that way naturally.   its not work to eat so infrequently  you are so satisfied with higher fat protein meals you just dont think about eating more often.
me at 25 37  did that lady age backwards by eating only meat for 20 years solid !me over the following 60 seconds  yooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
Ive just started a carnivore diet. Im excited to see what change happens.
I went vegan following dr mcdougalls starchitarian plan and Ive been very healthy for decades. the low-carb confusion seems to be what screws people up as they think eating a bunch of oatmeal and potatoes will make them fat. but if you dont add fats via oils you wont and it will provide what you need. but you wont get what you need eating just leafy veggies and oil.
we got herded animals - cows  goats  horses  alpacas  oxen  camels  swine - for at least 8 - 10 000 years and only in recent 20 years they are starting to be problem    d what idiotic argument. in my personal guess its not about cows  its about how to destroy global farming. in most places independen farming is based on cows becouse cows are the cheapest source of fertilisers for poor people. when they destroy this kind of farming there will be global hunger becouse poor farmers  not the corporational farming  can not afford to buy much of the expensive artificial fertilisers. its not problem to figure it out - my grandparents got cow. I was raised on raw milk. my grandpa would milked the cow early in the morning and my grandma gave us this delicious  still warm  sweet  fat milk  only filtered by clean gause - it was my breakfest before school.
@jartran72  we need massive amounts of farmlands to feed them and most of the time we get that land by deforrestation. we clearcut burn massive amounts of acres to plant mostly soja beans to feed tham. then the real problem is soja production and corporations who deforestate and not animals and farmers. use small  family farming which dont need to feed soja to animals  and dont need to deforestate  when I was teenager 70  population of my country was farmers  small or big  and most farm land was not deforested areas but grasses  meadows. use grass to feed animals  not soja. use small family farming not corpos. thats the solution    humanity is not a problem  its only propaganda of corporations and those who own them.
veganism is truly unhealthy. with vegetarianism  at least you can realistically avoid weird chemicals without much difficulty  but the vegans I know rely on supplements or energy drinks to fill in the nutrition gaps and eat synthmeat and other prepared synthfood.as a former vegetarian and nutrition nerd  I think melonie is falling into an opposing pseudo-science rabbit hole as the vegans are  but I do think even vegetarianism is a mistake long term  but its very useful in the short term to detox and recover from the common synthfoods and cheap meats that most people eat. Ive felt best after reintroducing birds on a somewhat regular basis and I can digest birds much better after being mostly vegetarian and hard cutting pork.
there s plenty of vegans who are perfectly healthy  you probably dont notice them because  well... they re healthy. I could just as well point to obese people who stuff themselves with bacon and stuff like that  and conclude that meat is bad  but thats obviously illogical. both omnivorous and vegan diets can be perfectly fine. the problem with going vegan is that a lot of people dont do the research necessary to replace all the nutrients that they ve cut out. its not just proteins  its also iron and vitamin b12. if youre not aware of that  then yeah  youre gonna be unhealthy. but if you manage to get those nutrients from other sources  youre totally fine!
@emmy lite  u did it wrong tho
@v a I n  I know many over 7 stop the cap  if you love animals and dont wanna hurt them thats cool do you but what I said still true
@illray vernon  cool story  bro. not even vegans themselves know  many   so thats interesting. I happen to know several vegans  from being vegan for 17 years myself  my ex the same  my old mom 10 years  I can go on and on. Ive never been able to stay under a normal bmI btw. my best example is a couple with four adult children  born vegan in 1976  78  81 and 83. born vegan. I know the parents and went to school with the kids - all good health. its just an anecdote  but 6 people  all vegan  all stages of life  should say something. its simple math  if you are under-eating  ie in a calorie deficit  you will lose weigh  no matter what diet you are following. they id!ots online are following a strict woo woo diet  not eating enough  of course they re gonna turn into skeletons. please  people learn how to use critical thinking  dead God. all my vegan friends are closing in to a decade or over.I cant prove what youre saying is not true  and vice versa  but its fascinating you have that many vegan friends!
I was 120lbs at 6 3  and the moment I started eating eggs again my muscle tone returned.
@jason rowlette  we lived on a ranch. our chickens lived in our garden eating bugs and weeds. I never understood why she had a problem with eating their eggs. I get the vegan argument  though I disagree with it  but our chickens were cared for about as well as its possible to be and protected from predators. a pack of coyotes will slaughter a whole coop  or make an awesome winter coat.
@little sausage  conditioning makes all the difference. those thatstopped eating eggs  as veg  believe that chickens are either in intolerable conditions or injected with hormones that keep them producing eggs to the point where their bones are robbed of calcium and weak brittle. those that aren t veg but give up eggs typically believe eggs are bad cholesterol which causes heart disease  but there s never been proof of thatsince a vegan is just as likely to have heart issues. in fact there s been a lot of evidence proving that we need the cholesterol  especially from the eggs.
@jason rowlette  our chickens were never fed hormones  its generally not worth it even in a commercial operation to do that. the labour of injecting tens of thousands of chickens is ludicrous. better to hatch new chickens to replace the molting ones you sell for ground chicken or dog food.we d feed the egg shells back to the chickens and our water is super hard so the worry is more too much calcium than too little. its  the breastbone that trades the calcium for eggs and none of our deads  where there s livestock there s deadstock  raccoons usually  clever bastards  I dissected had reduced breastbones.
@jason rowlette  I have an agriculture degree  I worked at a commercial chicken farm in my youth  in canada though which has a lot of different rules  I know the issues. there are points I dont agree with in the industry but generally its pretty good. these videos are always misrepresentations of the facts. they exaggerate practices which are absolutely unavoidable like slaughter and miss practices that are somewhat cruel like vegetarian diets for chickens. I have a small ranch  I raise all my animals with animal welfare as the top priority. my pork and  beef I sell to extremely high end restaurants because they have seen my operation and can see the value in the higher price I have to charge for the superior quality of the meat and ethical considerations. chicken is a sideshow for us because it is supply managed in canada so there s all kinds of legal red tape and costs to try to sell something for less than its worth so we dont do it but meat for myself I stick to the same philosophy as all my other meat.
lol
not much you can do. just be there when they need you. you cant force people to open their eyes. its frustrating  but everyone will start to ask questions in their own time when things get bad enough for them.
go watch the channel nutrition made simple! the guy is an actual scientist working in the field of nutrition and is way more qualified to be talking about this topic. melanie isn t a registered dietician or even certified in any nutritional field  and even if she was  nutrition certs are not indicative of any real knowledge in nutrition nor are those who hold them even allowed to treat peoples health issues with diet or create diet plans for people. most likely youre feeling better due to the weight loss  but just because a diet can induce weight loss doesnt mean it is a healthy one and weight loss isn t the end all-be all of health.
@patrick ryan  thanks for your concern  patrick.  I never said mel was my nutrition expert  just thatshe was the kick in the pants I needed to get back in shape.  I watch multiple nutrition channels to make sure Im getting everything my body actually needs.  I will check out your suggestion as well.
@shaz modeus  thanks for the kind response man. I just dont want this channel to lead people astray and away from actual nutritional scientists and registered dietitians
so sorry to see this. I hope he can break away from that and eat meat again  it completely transformed my health. the mental side effects when I was briefly vegan were so scary!
stick with it for at least a month  my man.
with high fat  try not to drink hour before and wait hour after eating....less likely to be on the toilet issues.
man love it when you talk about nutrition. I always learn so much from you. my favorite videos of yours is tomb raider and nutrition.
loved the video. I have a few friends who are vegetarians vegans so on occasion I ll have a meal with them and the thing thatstands out to me is an hour later Im ready to eat again. Im assuming this is a nutrient issue but if I dont eat meat with a meal then I feel like I haven t eaten at all.
this is an amazing video mel  thank you for sharing! you cover so many quality details here  and I ll recommend this video to anyone considering the benefits of the diet. carnivore has been hands down the best improvement Ive made in my 37 years of life and its not even close. my mental and physical wellness is the best its ever been. I cant imagine the superhuman I d be if I found this diet in my 20s but no matter what age you are  its never too late! 80s babies ftw!
I used to be a gym rat and just massive in general  Im 6 10  and was about 315 pounds of mostly muscle  and used to do things like the caber toss and hammer throw in the scottish highland games. broke my spine in a couple places almost 14 years ago now  my crippleversary is on the 13th  and have had major issues since. 7 spinal surgeries in so far... dropped down to about 290 now and have a gut I never had before so Ive lost a lot of muscle mass. just started to slowly get back into the gym and Ive been debating going carnivore for a while  listening to this may just be that push to get me to do it.
no matter how much people are confronted with the truth they wont change their stance on what they eat. the only way they will change is to have so many health issues that they are at a point of desperation and they re willing to try anything. this is the point of pride that you mentioned earlier in the video.
great video  very interesting information.  been shifting to the carnivore diet in the last few weeks  been feeling better and have more energy.
a friend of mine told me   Im vegan  while he was eating through a steak. when I asked him what s up with that  his response was   its kinda like how I consider myself a catholic  but Im not a very good catholic.
been doing  carnivore diet for about 4 months now  and personally outside of the way I feel  the best part of it is it makes my grocery shopping very simple lol
my girl go boom! Ive been on a carnivore keto diet for years. I stick more to a keto unless Im in a cutting zone. plus I like to use the bathroom normal
yo sis  I really dont pay attention to long video s   but hey this one jolted me and peaked my intrest. just the horrifying stories you where tellling about being vegan. Im down for horror stories and real life lessons with melonie mac any day
Im sorry I am a few days behind! just been a busy and hectic few days here. Ive been vegan for medical reasons for my brain and even then  there s no solid answers in this particular situation. but  I am not the crazy one who yells at people who are not vegan.
this was the perfect soundtrack to my strength training routine!
cow farts are an assanine argument  your killin me  mel
my thing is  I understand if someone is vegan  due to personal reasons such as perceived conviction or diet . I am not  and definitely agree. my problem is the self-righteous badgering from the outspoken ones. its almost a marketed religion at the end of the day. kudos for owning up to your mistakes  being open and honest about your experience. very valuable crucial information that alot of people dont realize. thanks for the verse at the end. it really rounded everything out.
I used to be a vegetarian for 6 months  I had to stop when I got really really sick. also  I was a bodybuilder for years and a powerlifter. if youre not eating a proper balanced diet which includes animal products such as meat eggs milk cheese  then youre just shooting yourself in the foot.
I have rheumatoid arthritis and eating a keto diet has helped me stop being stuck walking with a cane and even helped me get back to training for american ninja warrior . keto is the way to go
I was expecting a video over an hour  so I wonder how much you held back. haha! you got me eating ground beef with egg  although I like to incorporate them with some tortilla shells like a burrito. but my homemade burritos are bomb! mmmm!
wish in could afford a carnivore diet ... on a fixed income  caring for disabled child  and meat prices are unGodly. never felt worse unable to eat meat more than once a day. you are 100  right  mel.
at first  you feel great because youre actually getting nutrients you ve been neglecting in your standard diet.  I was powerlifting at the time and dropped 10 lbs in 2 weeks and had my best numbers ever.  but circumstances arose and when I tried to get back into lifting  my numbers were lower than when I was a sophomore in high school.  I was so embarrassed I avoided lifting for years  went back to it about 6 months into reintroducing animal products into my diet and my numbers shot back up to my pre-powerlifting days.
hImel....  I have followed you for a little bit.  I have been carnivore since sep. 2018.  I was surprised you didn t mention dr. shawn baker who started meatrx and bart kay who is s nutrition scientist who talks about keto and carnivoire.  I would guess you might of heard of them and also dont forget the petersons as well jordan and his daughter mehkala.  also I am a huge tomb raider fan as well but I am an old man so I was really surprised  as young as you is a fan too.  I enjoy your content keep up the good work.
protein and fat take significantly longer to digest than carbs. so  even with vegetables  you ll get hungry much sooner than you would eating meat simply because they are digested more quickly.
should look up shawn baker  he really pushed me to try it for a month.  I haven t been able to get myself motivated to get back on it recently which I really do...
some of us are self-righteous true  but most vegans really want people to have more compassion for animals by showing what happens to them. you can call us a   religion   if you want  but the main reason find us insufferable is because we are a constant reminder of where their food comes from.
its not as expensive as you might think. I dont eat steak everyday  as that would be expensive--mix it up. I spend a bit less actually  because I dont eat out or buy junk food  except for rare cheat meals   which is more expensive when yourealize how empty those calories are. I eat smaller  more substantial portions and Im satiated for a longer period of time. I usually eat one meal per day  I use intermittent fasting. I dont eat anything for 20-22 hours  and eat during that 2-4 hour window.  and the fats keep me satisfied all day  where as I used to eat 3 meals  plus snacks  and always felt hungry. you can do it with some proper planning. good luck
I dont know your exact financial situation  but maybe you can buy ground beef and freeze it.
buying in bulk makes itsignificantly cheaper  ground beef and eggs are excellent options.
costco is a great place to buy bacon  because you can get double packs that are cheaper comparably to single packs at grocery stores. itshould last you and your child a long time between the two of you.
a couple of decades ago I became a vegetarian  not a vegan  for health reasons and at first it was great  I lost 15 pounds off my 160 lbs frame. after six years without meat I didn t see any benefits to it. when I hit 30  I gained 55 pounds  Im currently 220 lbs. it was at that point I went back to eating whatever I want in moderator. regardless what you do its down hill after 30. when youreach 40 you have to exercise twice as hard to keep the weight off. dont listen to the marketing bs. buying organic foods are a waste of money since there are no standards to adhere to. growers can apply for a license to go organic without having to meet with a food inspector. another thing I need to address is  its extremely difficult to reduce carbohydrates when all package foods have a ton of carbs. I think the health crysis is caused by an over abundance of wheat and corn. all packaged food has either wheat or corn. wheat causes a greater allergic response than any other food.
they all lost some weight.. pause ..if they were fat.  I actually laughed out loud when you did that  though it wasn t a comedic pause.
honest video. Im really warming to this lass. Im beginning to believe she s actually genuine.
the mere fact that you can always spot the vegan in a crowd based on how sickly they look should tell you all you need to know about how horrible it is for your body.
I would pay good money to see melonie mac vs. vegan gains debate
I tried to go vegan for health reasons  I have crohns disease  and Im pretty sure I got worse as a result of it  so I switched back to eating a mixture of both.  sure there are buff dudes out there who are purely vegan  but I personally would rather stick to the food chain and get what I need without having to risk a complex diet that could make me more weak and sick. there are a lot of meats and veg I cannot eat  but  I still feel like a balanced diet did much more to help me function normally.
yeah... the human gut is simply not designed to consume the level of plants that we are expected to eat  particularly grains. also  most veggies should be sprouted or fermented before human consumption  otherwise  it does a number on our gut flora. thanks for this video  and for your honesty and transparency.
the funny thing is that the ad before this video was a plant based health shake commercial.
have you seen any studies that debunk red meat and digestive health  i.e. diverticulosis and increased fiber  thx for your videos!
had some ribs and steak friday night  felt like a titan Lord over the weekend.
veganism is basically a cult lol thats why they are always trying to recruit people. I definitely prefer keto and Ive been on keto for 3 years so far after trying all sorts of ways to eat. keto keeps my mood stable and the mental clarity is really nice aside from the increased energy of course. I still remember my first time when I entered ketosis  I couldn t sleep for 2 days because I had so much energy and that was despite me fasting.
im just gonna say it  im in love! video games  action movies  culture awareness    lets face it  drop dead gorgeous! wait a second were you made in a lab  is this a deep fake
Ive always been pretty healthy strong but several years ago I had cancer I was 35  Im 43 now . after surgery treatment I was put on a special doctor recommended diet that was heavy in dietary fiber carbs and felt terrible since. I went full carnivore about 3 months ago. my body adapted to this diet extremely fast. I noticed positive changes within days and I haven t felt this good in years! my diet now is mostly beef  eggs  liver  and beef bone broth. oh and the fact that you can get me  someone raised by nut job Christian occultist s  willingly listen to the scripture of the day is probably the biggest surprise! keep up the great job melonie!
my friend has been vegan for about 8 years and his hair is falling out in clumps and he s in his 20 s.
june 1st will make a year since I started keto  vastly carnivore  to fit back into my kilt for my friend s wedding. jumped from 87kg to 63 now I have to buy another kilt for the opposite reason xdI ll have to go to my parents house and unpack my teenager clothes if they still exist
my breakfast this morning was 100  bovine protein. I do clean keto as much as I can   intermittent fasting.
wow  never heard anyone who was vegan say they were wrong. usually they say they needed to eat meat for health reasons  but being vegan is still the best choice in their opinion. also  ask any vegan how many supplement pills they are prescribed.  it is insane. just one question  how do you get fiber  thank you for sharing your story!
I was vegan for nearly 10 years. I quit to have more food freedom and try new things. plain and simple. I dont feel less or more healthy  but Im certainly happier. also  sushI and salmon exist  so
I always avoided vegetables since I was a child. Im 38 now and good health.
its seems  a rarity  to see attractive womena like mel and anna thatstar wars girl that arent fake about being a nerd  and being highly passionate on nerd related things. and are bold about it and will not allow the wokies bully them not being themsleves.  its refreshing to see  sane opinons.
calorie deficit with preferably healthy calorie intake try fasting and working and while eating healthy is probably the best way people try to find loops holes to bring gluttonous pigs but you ll appreciate food more when you aren t scarfing it down and enjoy your meals alot more. thats for most people s experience with fasting but not everyone is the same
when I hit 30  I gained 55 pounds... um....clearly that is from either too many calories  i.e. you were a junk-food vegetarian   vegan  or you got a disease that you aren t telling us about.you dont just gain 55lbs less you are way over eating.your situation is not a vegetarian or vegan issue but it has to do with your food selection. vegetarian or vegan tell you nothing of what a person eats. vegetarians sometimes eat cheese  drink milk  eat eggs or fish  depending on what sku of  vegetarian  that they are. also a diet of oreos and pepsI would be just as vegan as a diet made up of mostly whole plant foods. when youreach 40 you have to exercise twice as hard to keep the weight off only if you keep eating a shitty diet. I am 52 and I am still in the mid 150 s. I feel full whenever I eat  and I lift a little weight now and then. I am lean enough that my muscles show. I am pretty sure that what I am doing is vastly diet as my weight lifting might total 1 hour per week. I get plenty of calories and have no problems working my sets through to my target rep   weight and still I periodically as a rep or a little weight now and then.you need to see a doctor as you might have some underlying condition or at least a dietitian as you also might have no idea  like you think you do  about how to build a healthy diet whether vegetarian  vegan or omnivore. you clearly cant get the calories right so you gained 55lbs at 30  which is still in the age range of peak health and conditioning. if you ate lots of healthy fruits and veggies  not your entire diet but lots of them  you simply wouldn t have the room or appetite to eat so many excess calories that you could tub up by 55lbs.
except thats confirmation bias on your part because it objectively isn t true. you d find way more meat eaters who look unhealthy but your reticular activating system filters them out. sadly  people value stories over statistics. if you want to play the anecdote game  here you go  Im 35 year old actor. I regularly play characters in their early twenties  my levels are better than the vast majority of people and I haven t even had a cold in six and a half years.
for gut inflammation you should go carnivore
I agree  I wasn t created to be a vegetarian.  or on the non believers ...okay I didn t claw my way to the top of the food chain just to eat vegetables.
same. I tried all the keto snacks  cakes  breads  etc  and its just like eating a disappointingly bland science experiment. getting adjusted to real food like fatty meats and green veg is better. carbonated water replaced sugar-free soda.
um  what  are you sure that you are talking about vegans  Ive been vegan for about 5 years and didn t eat meat for a few years before thatso no meat for about a decade and I have never once been prescribed any supplements. I do take one because it is recommended for anyone regardless of diet but I was never prescribed the supplement.
the supplement industry and health industry relies on meat eatersvegans have better health outcomes in all meta-analyses and I personally see the utter physical degradation of people consuming diets high in meaton the contrary  its carnivore cultists who push thousands of pills and they usually have interest in selling them  like liver king  paul saladino and whatnot
I d been contemplating going carnivore ever since I heard jordan peterson talking about the health benefits he and mikhala had received from it but didn t take the plunge until I watched you talking about the other health benefits.  a little over three months in and Im down 40lbs and a few pants sizes!   also I started full body calisthenics every day so Im hoping to be in the best shape of my life by the time my birthday hits around the new year!   thanks for the inspiration!   hope you and yours have a wonderful memorial day!
I was shopping once and some vegan lady came up to me while I was grabbing ground beef and said  nothing I eat had to die  you should try veganism  so I was like  so you eat plants then  you know plants are living creatures too right  youre no better then I am  blew her freakin mind lol
the whole point I was trying to make is you can be slightly overweight and still be healthy. there s people thats bulimic with horrible health.  skinny doesnt equal healthy!
you mention different diets for everyone and what comes to mind is a graphic I saw long ago thatshowed the best diet by blood type. when I showed it to my group of friends the diets listed were accurate for each of us relative to our blood types. for me as a type o it was very heavy meat with little to no carbs. I know my body needs red meat because I decided to give up red meat for lent one year. 40 days without red meat was brutal and the cravings were intense so when easter came I spent a week eating nothing but red meat with small sides of other meat. it didn t occur to me to make that an actual diet despite losing quite a bit of weight that week.
been carnivore before it blew up. cured an autoimmune disease I was diagnosed with at 20 years old
lierre keith wrote a great book entitled  the vegetarian myth  that goes into detail about the deficiencies of nutritional and philosophical vegenism and vegetarianism.
remember in mass effect 1 this plant thing started taking people over. it killed a whole colony
a bunch of preschoolers would be jumping in the aisles now if they could understand what you said here.
cant wait to watch this!
I came ready for this long video today.
just eat meat  bro!   lol   love this vid.
I was vegan for a year - it was a terrible mistake. fortunately I had no long-term health problems from it.
seriously these people pop up on several topics just to force or torture others. its really draining peoples energy and patience  like they are energy vampire or something.
fish  eggs  lamb  wheat  butter  fruits  and a very small amount of dairy and vegetables  is so far the foods I hear Jesus ate. for me I like to add in deer  chicken  pig  turkey  squirrel  rabbits  and cow into this diet. so far itseems to work  haven t got sick in over 16 years now.
two times during my life I wanted to become  healthy  by being  vegan . I got hardcore anemia and was unable to climb the second floor. I need meat  period.
I love the idea of carnivore. I keep seeing these videos but I know its something I could never do. like a terminator learning emotions but never being able to cry. I love the excitement of  let s order a pizza   damn well knowing the actual cramping and acid eruptions that come with pizza night but Imean...   or the visual gratification of stirring loads of bok choy into a soup  I love my fries  I love to put together and then wallow in the buttery heaven of a bowl of risotto. I just love all the things that would break a carnivore diet but damn if I dont feel great after a four egg cheese omelette  a long busy day of just water and then a fatty charred ribeye at night! Ive had those days and my body takes a break when they happen. but my love of other foods is deeper than  oh just try cutting them out  you ll stop craving soon enough . its not a conditioned craving  its episodic memory I dont want to lose.plus the sourdough french toast I just killed off while watching this was really good! Im a cook. what can I say!
mel dropping truth bombs
sign me up for the ribeye diet lmao
ribeyes everyday thats a dream a damn expensive one but a dream. dont think I could give up potatoes and bread.
@melonie  here is a conspiracy theory for you. I watched the entire video and out of the 3 ads I was presented with  2 were for kachava  a plant based food replacement drink. hmmm.
yes and there are some very weird interesting experiments about electrical impulses in neighboring plants when you harm a plant  like they are reacting to the  violence  against their neighbor.
@mike pc  I have met one vegan that was nice and did not push it
@mike pc  honestly it felt more like a sale pitch then her being rude I just have a habit of having a thought process xd
well  nothing I eat had to die too  but it would be cruel.
Im not vegan but honestly I do feel like vegans are morally better than non-vegans in this one area.
@mike williams  Ive heard that argument and I didn t believe it when I was anti-vegan a couple of years ago. I haven t seen any data on it. two things happened from my anti-vegan days to today  where Im considering plant based keto or something   1  I got a pet ringneck parrot. 2  I learned about islam.I realized from my pet bird that animals are a lot smarter than we think  that they have likes  dislikes  they have feelings and emotions such as love and affection and that they fear death and want to live. as I learned more about islam  the people who practice it and its history  I realized that I like animals and care more for them then I do certain types of people.
@timon alexandr  animals are meant to die for animals  regardless of emotions. more vegans means cultivating more farmland which obviously kills many more animals than raising and killing livestock. you d have to argue that grubs and insects are just not as important to protect as birds and such. and if birds are better than people  than maybe grubs are even better.
@mike williams  well  I do think that insects like cockroaches  for example  are less important than animals like birds  goats  sheep  cow  etc.. I absolutely do think that the well being of birds is way more important than the well being of certain groups of people. if you dont think so then thats because you are ignorant of what these certain groups of people have done and what they are capable of doing and what they are trying to do.
@timon alexandr  all life is important  you can watch the scientific documentary called  the lion king  to learn about the circle of life. insects have arguably an even more important role to play. not that I really personally care about this topic  I just thought it was funny to see someone talk about how they have favourites and about morals.unless you understand the ecosystem and how everything connects  I will not pretend to   youre not having these opinions based on anything other than emotions.
@timon alexandr  youre basing your decision on whether or not its moral for people to eat birds on the actions of a  certain  group of people. im guessing youve placed yourself outside that group. if you think roaches are less important than birds then you must be ignorant of what some birds have done  and especially  to insects.
@eohryan  well  I like to think that Im logical and that my arguments are philosophically consistent. so  hear me out and tell me if you think Im wrong.one thing Ive learned is that goats  sheep  pigs are not too different from dogs in intelligence. and there are many who are upset at the thought of our k9 best friend being used as food in the far east  china  korea . in the us and europe  australia  etc.. the gov. would never allow dogs to be used as a food source. so the difference in only certain animals being allowed for food consumption is entirely cultural and morally arbitrary. we also dont suffer from a problem of overpopulation of sheep  goats  chickens  so it doesnt seem to me that there s a direct impact from these specific animals that we use for food on the eco system. furthermore  a person earlier talked about how farming leads to a lot of deaths of grubs  insects and probably rodents and the like.. but today we have the technology to grow four times  and probably more  the produce in vertical farms using 70  to 95  less water and this is without any harm done to insects and rodents.lastly  the moral argument I briefly talked about earlier. again  through my experience with islam  I have discovered that humans have an almost limitless capacity for evil. I dont think we are good at all. many groups of humans are like zombies. brainwashed or braindead zombies. zombies that are capable of and are programmed to do great evil. think of it like this.. you would be more succesful in changing the behavior of an animal such as a goat  sheep  a cow then you will in changing the behaviour of a zombie. based on this discovery  I dont believe that humans are entitled to or have some sort of an intrinsic right to take the lives of animals.
@timon alexandr  I believe that birds are inherently evil and are beyond any kind of redemption. my pet tarantulas second this. to each his own.
@mike williams  insects dont have the complex emotions that animals do. well  I do not want to do things that you would consider are  objectively evil   so I would place myself as outside that group  of people .
@mike williams  all birds or some birds  my ringneck parakeet is a vegetarian. he wont eat meat even if you give it to him.also  give me your definition of  evil .
@timon alexandr  I dont have any opinions about eating dogs  but you get a lot more meat out of a sheep  a goat  a cow  a pig etc than a dog  and its easier to feed them.pigs for example  they will eat anything and everything and they just keep growing and growing and growing. these animals were not chosen as a popular food source by accident  outside of some religions of course .guy I work with has pigs  goats  chickens  ducks  gheese  quayle and more on his land  all for personal use only . the pigs are like garbage tins  they wll even eat horse shit if they find it  they just consume everything and anything  their jaws chomp through bone  they will attempt to eat everything. the goats  they eat all the weeds  vegetation etc  dont need to be fed much as they just graze all day off the land  stuff we cant eat. he also grows all kinds of plants  root vegetables  herbs  fruits you name it. all of the waste from everything is used  big circle of life vibes  and a lot of the unusable waste is turned into protein by being fed to those animals  but a dog cant wont eat the same stuff  not a good food source regardless of morals.
@eohryan  in my post I was inferring the moral equivalence of eating dogs vs goats  sheep  pigs. Im not convinced of the  its easier to farm this animal   which if you want to go by its easiest to just grow crops. also  wild dogs  will eat just about anything  even decaying vegetable matter. hell  forget wild dogs  pet dogs eat their own poo  Ive seen it. if  easier to farm  is all the justification we need then why dont we just farm and eat cockroaches and other bugs thatsome scientists have suggested  that d be way more environmentally friendly too  partly why they suggested it. but we dont eat bugs  some cultures do. a lot of what we do and dont eat is based on chance more than anything.I think what we eat and dont eat should be based on something other what is the easiest to farm. pigs are smarter than three year old s  they feel emotions like fear and they do not want to die and that doesnt sit right with me.
@timon alexandr  to be moral  we should choose what to eat based on what is good for humans. as a human  it is  in my opinion  immoral to place another animal above us. youre considering amount of evil and level of complexity and by this  youve placed birds higher than people. its interesting because what you likely consider  evil  is the natural result of complexity itself. so the top of your heirarchy will always become questionable.and a Christian  who undoubtedly believes in the evil of men  would nevertheless place people above all other animals  especially in regards to food sources  so to do so would be moral. so  to go by evil and complexity gets muddled and to go by religion cantoo.vegans do not have the moral high ground in any objective sense. it can be moral to eat other animals and is immoral to harm human life in favor of other life.and maybe those groups of bad people you speak of are people who have abstained too much from eating meat and this was the result.
false equivalence. hurt a dog  and you can get into trouble. hurt a plant and no-one bats an eye. I d argue that the bugs that die are of more significance than the plant itself.
@timon alexandr  a dog needs to eat certain things to survive  it cannot digest most of the waste product from processing crops and other plants  it cant eat grass and weeds.cows  goats and sheep turn vegetation we cannot eat  that grows on land that mostly cannot be used to grow crops to begin with and turns that into protein we can eat.  set aside the morals  eating dog is inefficient because they need most of the same foods we do  unlike most livestock. as for eating insects  pretty common to eat insects in the east. pigs are intelligent yes  but they are also a really great source of food  unlike dogs. the circle of life  remember that  all life consumes and creates. if you want to go eat only plants you go right ahead.
@mike williams  dude  youre making baseless universal claims. what is good for humans  who gets to decide what is good for humans  a consequentialist can say  as many scientists do make this claim  that farming animals is bad for the environment  and thus bad for humans  and so we should not eat animals. your claim that its  immoral to place animals above  is is also entirely baseless. go to a dog park in texas or something and try to kill someone s pet and when the owner shoots you dead see if any court convicts him her of murder. that dog owner  by shooting you  will have put the life of an animal above yours and no court will convict him for murder. whether youre a humanist or you believe the state gives you your morals  your beliefs and values are entirely subjective to your own personal experience. your ideas  from what you have communicated to me  aren t the least bit logical or consistent. you just state that humans should eat animals and then dance around the subject making random statements here and there.the bad people  i.e. practicing muslims from the islamic state are not vegans.
@eohryan  lol  why set aside the morals  so if new born human babies were a great source of food and easy to farm  you d be eating little babies  anyway  Ive already addressed your argument and youre not stating anything new here.
@timon alexandr  youre using the term  baseless  a lot for what started out as two people sharing opinions. I think you just fail to see or are too affronted to admit that you see the logic in what I am saying. there is surely nothing random about my statements and if you see randomness then you have a problem. I dont.what is good for humans  thats for you to decide. but do whats best for humans  not other animals. if youre religion or anything else tells you otherwise then id say its wrong. the argument about farming animals being bad for the environment and thus bad entirely is very weak. its called throwing the baby out with the bathwater. its like saying we shouldnt brush our teeth because that means we make more plastic which harms the environment and ourselves down the line. yes  I believe it is immoral to place animals above us being that you are a human. that is my opinion. please feel free to have a different one instead of being offended.the dog park thing made no sense at all. a person taking such an action does not come down to them putting a human above a dog necessarily and even if it did  what on earth is your point  im arguing its immoral to do so. im not arguing everyone in the world agrees with that. I dont get where you were going with that. you could almost say  your statements are sounding  random  baseless. you were basing your heirarchy of animals on complexity and  evil  while failing to see that one comes from the other. humans are advanced enough to make decisions that you then  being advanced enough to notice  could construe as  evil.  you are placing other animals above humans only because they lack the complexity to offend in that way. its like praising a criminal who has been in prison for the last five years for not committting crimes in the last five years. its a view on the heirarchy of animals thats fine in the middle but gets fuzzy at the top but its yours  keep it. everyone has their own opinion.anyway  this was my last comment.
@timon alexandr  alright if youre really dying to talk about morals youre going to end up with egg on your face.so if youre farming the dogs for food you need to feed them  dogs would produce little meat and require similar food to humans in order to survive  they also need meat.so you have to kill animals to feed the animals to feed humans. not only that  while aprox 2 3 of the open land on this planet cannot grow crops due to unsuitable conditions of soil terrain water you will find that grass can grow on almost all of it.goats  sheep and cows eat grass  they eat food we cannot eat so to eat dogs instead means to put even more strain on the 1 3 that land that can grow crops while the 2 3 of grassland either goes unused or is still used to raise livestock to feed to the dogs.from an environmental point of view  eating dogs is morally bankrupt. eating goats sheep and cows  not so much.
@eohryan  again  wild dogs can survive on decaying plant matter  even vomit  faeces and decaying flesh. wild dogs derive nutrients from things that humans cannot digest. dogs can live and grow without meat just fine. also  you state that you want to talk morals  but then you go right back to talking about what s easier to farm. also there are a lot of indoor and outdoor vertical growth system that yield the same amount of crops in 1 10th the space and using 70  to 95  less water. ezgro is one such system  but Imention it because the creator claims to be a pioneer  original founder in this field. so arable land is no longer a requirement.
@mike williams  actually  scientists do have a consensus that farming animals is bad for the environment   scientific consensus shows that animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5-16.5  of global greenhouse gas emissions and causes significant environmental degradation  from biodiversity loss to deforestation . to put things into perspective  the global green house emissions generated by animal farming are about the same as the transportation sector.  do what s best for humans  not other animals  otherwise youre wrong  - I do not agree with this statement and it is what I would call a baseless universal statement. what is good for some humans is not good for all humans and vice versa. where do you get this ultimate moral authority to claim that  human lives are more important than animal lives  anyway  humans are animals. many humans  such as the practicing muslims from the islamic state  prove that humans are far more cruel and evil than any species of animal in the wild. if toothbrushes harm the environment  then we should reinvent toothbrushes as to not harm the environment. there is no reason why you cant have both  good dental hygene and teeth cleaning devices that dont harm the environment. the dog park example proves that your morals and values are subject to your own personal experiences and preferences. and I dont have a hierarchy of animals  Im simply questioning and rejecting your which arbitrarily puts human wants above all else.
@eohryan  Im not making anything up. I also didn t say grass  I said  decaying plant matter  and you can google it if you dont believe me.
@timon alexandr  yes youre saying decaying plant matter to dodge the fact that we re talking about goats and sheep that live off of grass which neither dogs nor humans can digest take nutrition from.https   youtu.be sgg-a80tl5g - take a look at this mate  one of the  non imaginary  scientists in the field covers the topic well.
blood type diets are such a farce in my humble opinion
go you
same. Ive been mostly carnivore to offset my as.
bruh  stop abusing animals  talk to a health professional and theyll prob tell you how you canthrive on a plant based diet
@ookey bookey  abuse tho enjoy your supplements
@assassin 9958  better than having a middleman  or middle cow
@ookey bookey  supplements aren t replacement for food enjoy your supplements
@assassin 9958  Ive been vegan for two years and have never taken a supplement.
@ookey bookey  Im vegan as well but youreally should take b12 and possibly omega-3. unless youre eating fortified foods you cant get b12 without a supplement. omega-3 can be obtained through food in the form of ala  which is necessary  but epa and dha cant from what I know and the conversion of ala to epa and dha isn t super reliable.
@patrick ryan  I got my blood tested and Im all good  but am considering getting another  thanks btw.
I read that book  it really helped me overcome the lingering vegan guilt I battled with so hard lol
she really stuck her neck out for that  book. this was a very good breakdown. it might help other s rid themselves of dietary guilt.
thanks for the heads up  writing down the name of that book right now
@melonie mac go boom  if you are open to it  I would actually like to have a conversation about veganism  with you. you seem to be very misinformed about it. I could be wrong but the video definitely holds some false and harmful information.
@melonie mac go boom  not to mention some strawman arguments.
@ookey bookey  no problem  hope all stays well. b12 levels could take up to 4  years to deplete so thats what I suggest to just look into a supplement.
@ookey bookey  doubtful
@assassin 9958 supplements are modern day miracles and allow us to be healthier than ever before. if I cantake one small b12 supplement to meet my 2mg a day need for it then I ll take that over consuming meat.
@assassin 9958  well  your loss. either get with the times are be left behind
@patrick ryan  actually its your loss as you are the one restricting yourself
@assassin 9958  not really  I have plentiful options of food to eat. I cut out 1  of food. I still have thousands of other options to eat.
@patrick ryan  you cut out far more than 1 percent as you are restricting yourself from entire food groups
@assassin 9958  I restrict myself from animal products  thats it. I dont even necessarily restrict myself  I just dont want them anymore. I have all kinds of plant food to eat like fruits  veggies  whole grains  legumes  nuts  mushrooms. in these categories is hundreds to thousands of foods I can eat.
@patrick ryan  ok and I have everything you have plus more so your diet is more restrictive than mine
@assassin 9958  yes my diet is only working because supplements and for like the third time  thats the beauty of the modern world. I can do all kinds of things that people in the past couldn t do. for example I dont need to kill an animal or fund the killing of animals to eat. I can also drink clean water whenever I want or take a clean shower whenever I want. you need a measly 2mg a day of b12 so acting like Im relying on supplements for a large portion of my diet is quite odd.also just letting you know a large portion of farm animals are supplemented. for example cows are supplemented with cobalt.
@ookey bookey  stop shilling malnutrition
@chris r.  shillings
ive been vegan for 3 years now. I was 14 when I started.. im 83 years old now!
dont worry  almost no carnivore person actually follows the diet long-term  at least the influencers. they always end up adding back carbohydrates in the form of fruit  honey  sometimes even rice  and have to rely on a bunch of supplements  which they re always happy to sell to carnivore cultists  to avoid deficiencies  or just make money   but they re incredible sophists and can pilpul themselves  or at least their audience  into believing its all somehow ancestral or shit like that.
spend your potato and bread money on beef.
my friends were discussing how we consume meat in america. the big three are pork  poultry  and beef. one friend suggested we branch out to other meats. Im thinking there should be fast food joint where they serve rabbit
I often like to switch things up when Im cooking. exploring new tastes is always interesting. I eat meat  vegan  etc.
q. how can you tell someone is a vegan  a. they ll f   ing tell you.
heart disease is not a modern illness caused by eating process foods. otzI the iceman is a 5300 year old frozen corpse found on a glacier in the alps. after a lengthy examination of otzI s body  samples were analysed and the scientist discovered this man in his 50s suffered from heart disease  though he actually died from an arrow piercing his lung.
hImelonie I hope your enjoyed your weekend  takecare melonie
you should do a nutrition  go boom podcast
we also have to bear in mind the difference between grass fed free range vs factory farmed meat and eggs. the quality and condition of the meat animal does matter  I believe especially in the long term. if possible  go grass fed  otherwise lamb is a better option as sheep tend to be pasture raised. if you can stand the taste  goat milk and cheese is a bit better for humans  and itseems that most of the blue zones might have something to do with goat herding
the way things are going insects are really the way to go
okay  but how can g-fuel fit into every diet   sorry  I couldn t resist lol
I have for a long time been thinking of doing something with my diet. after listening to you talk about carnivore I started to look it up. I haven t gone all in. the big thing was that I totally removed pasta from my diet. my goal was nothing related to my weight. get more energy  get more motivation. eating alot more meat and eggs the last 2 months. I have gotten more energy  Ive gotten more focused. it feels alot better  and recently I started putting that energy into a dreamproject Ive been working on slowly for maybe 2 years.please do more carnivore-content!
seeing what it did to robert downey jr. was more than enough to convince me that veganism is utter folly.  squidward laugh   iron deficient man   squidward laugh
have you ever tried pure carnivore vs mostly carnivore and some veg   was there a noticeable difference between the two
old school balanced meals. everything thing in moderation.
damn girl  youre brave  d they re gonna come for you! lol. Ive been down many a rabbit hole about diet but Ive never heard of veggies being bad for you. thats a new one for me but it does add up with my own experiences. there s also the fact that the government is now pushing veganism so that means its obviously not good. Ive been having auto immune issues for a few years now. its in the family etc. Ive been doing keto for a while with if and it definitely helps... I got rid of loads of symptoms but... the main issue is still here and the only thing I can eat with no bloating or issues of any kind is beef. Imainly just eat eggs  meat  fish  fruit  salad and broccolI now. Imay  have to try ditching the salads   veg for a while and see how that feels. where do you get your potassium from  is that even an issue  idk  there s so much conflicting info out there...
grass should be mowed   smoked  not eaten!
I knew someone in college who survived three years on just pringles... I believe pringles is vegan.
carnivore keto saved my life! butter coffee helped me lose 30  lbs! I love the high fat yum. I was vegan for 1.5 years  not good for me.
Im eating healthy  consooooms processed food
melonie can you do some videos of recipes of things you eat I want to try the carnivore diet as well  God bless take.care
high protein really only hurts your kidneys if you already have ckd chronic kidney disease
rabbit is amazing. a good moose and rabbitstew is worth killing someone for.
q. a vegan  a person who buys bit coin  and a cross fit trainer walk into a bar. who tells you about themselves first  a. the person with a glutton allergy.
@kalan darkclaw  mix in some odd manner of pronoun use  and thats my new favorite joke.
you cant tell different between them. show vegan make no visual impact
as far as health goes  grass fed is so minimally different than grain fed that the added price is not even worth it
he looks pretty much the same as he only did a few years ago
she either manipulated the story with the pictures or she isn t to smart the picture where robert looks  better  is 15 years earlier then his  bad . picture so ofc he wil look older and she compares a much younger picture where he trained for a movie with a 15 years older picture nowhere he is on a break  thats not telling a fair  story
@marc van der meyden  if thats the case that is bad
@underthegun897  his cheeks were never thatsunken in ever.
@one pound swallow two pound coconut  you can find people with worse sunking cheeks who eat allot of meat so youre point is moot realy.
@marc van der meyden  false. Ive never met anybody  or seen anybody with such sunken cheeks that weren t already sick. you see it in vegans all the time.
@one pound swallow two pound coconut  the picture she posted of him all tan and photoshopped is from 2009. the other is a video he took on his instagram not all dolled up for a hollywood movie. the fact that anyone takes this girl seriously or is still defending this nonsense is hilarious
yup  as Imentioned in the video I did keto before which is similar to carnivore but with veggies. great results  but like I said in the video  cutting out all plants made things way better for my health
@melonie mac go boom  thanks  I suppose I should try going carny  all the way
@slakoffs  same thing for me. I ll spare you my symptoms  save to say that I still had them until I gave up on keto and went full carnivore. I am finally beginning to recover.
@underthegun897  I completely agree. we see this often within the anti-vegan community. they basically just watch all the other anti-vegans and repeat what they re saying. we see this in politics as well. they very often refuse to look at the science such as randomized control trials and epidemiological studies. Ive spent a fair amount of time watching anti-vegans such as liver king  saladina  sv3rige  and others and notice they all resort to logical fallacies and manipulative tactics consistently.
@ian marshall  that is pretty stupid to do and unfortunate I usually like this youtubers videos
@one pound swallow two pound coconut  a yes because you know the whole world so everyone thats vegan is dying you do know thatsounds very silly right.I happen to be a person with naturel sunken cheeks I have heard all my life I should eat more while am perfectly healthy infact it realy annois me when the next person who knows nothing about how people can naturely look tell me am unhealthy just because I hve sunken cheeks some people just look like that naturely.snoop dog ate meat all his life untill some years ago and that dude is the skinniest person I ever seen so what should I think then that both meat and veggies are bad for you because he looks skinny while he did both diets  I hope you are smarter then that.
meat has potassium
@melonie mac go boom  it does  lol well... everyday is a school day.  I ll have to do some testing then. appreciate the reply
please go watch the channel  nutrition made simple!  he is an actual scientist doing work in the field of nutrition who has the credentials to be talking about nutrition and giving advice. this woman has no credentials at all and is wrong or flat out lying when it comes to what she says about nutrition. please dont listen to random twitch streamers who have no credentials or any prior knowledge in nutrition for your nutritional advice.
@jdmstav  yes and how the experts have changed their opinions. data going back decades shows the benefits of whole food plant based diets and the results are constantly being replicated. there are very little to no studies on carnivore diets and any that are around dont show good results. who are you going to believe  some random twitch streamer or pretty much every single nutritional scientist  and in case you start mentioning people some of the  experts  on the side of carnivore like paul saladino and shawn baker  they dont even have and md in any nutritional or bioengineering field. they are a psychiatrist and a orthopedic surgeon respectively.
hI kids
tell that to cows!
@ookey bookey  when they can read  sure!
@ookey bookey  cows are herbivores
@assassin 9958  maybe they should be strong and eat meat!
@pr0nqqb  what if someone cant read
@ookey bookey  what if air was blue
@ookey bookey  again they are herbivores
@assassin 9958  ok
hI kid.
does that apply to a landing strip
a woman admitting she was wrong  gasp! we truly are at the end of times.  xd  but seriously  I just logically deduced it was all bs even on my early teens.  Imet a vegetarian  then  and in addition to her strange and unappealing diet. she took supplements  she explained it was to compensate for her diet. I asked if she had some problems. you know  some people still need supplement if their eating is insufficient or have some conditions. she told me that  thats how it was for all vegetarian.  and it just hit me.if you need supplements for a  well rounded diet  then its not well rounded. most of my elders lived 90  years and many made it pass 100.  my grandpa  in his 90s now  eat eggs every single morning.  and he is healthy enough to drive  walk a couple miles each day. its in better shape than most people I know in the mid 50s. and his memory is superb.  you can  not convince me  that after witnessing many of my family and their friends lived healthy and long lives while eating meat on a daily basis that its bad for you.  specially since every vegetarian and vegan Ive met  including some family members have terrible health  specially for their age. like your hair shouldn t be falling at 19.  and now  as an adult  for years Ive been saying they wanna force that diet on people to keep them week and docile  and more malleable. cause in my experience  every hardcore veggI are highly susceptible into believing whatever bs the establishment tells them.
in the middle ages  farmers used a three field crop rotation  one field planted with legumes to infuse nitrogen into the soil  one field planted with fall winter wheat and rye  and one field left fallow to rest each year. peasants also keep their animals in the fallow field to add their special fertilizer. native americans planted the three sisters  corn  legumes  and squash to self fertilize. now  farmers are heavily dependent on artificial fertilizer  made from fossil fuels  to grow their crops  so vegans not only have blood on their hands  but they use more fossil fuels to grow their food than beef.
this gets posted the moment my carnivore crisps order arrives!
what if you dont like eggs  is there a good replacement you can have in their place  or are they a must
reminds me of the vegan ex from scott pilgrim   chicken parmesan isn t vegan
william shatner is vegan and he did an awareness video that I saw when I was 16 which made me quit eating meat. its impossible to have a social life and do it and ever to go out though. I wonder if he s still doing it
eh. 10 years in  slim with a bunch of muscle on me. get to eat a lot. also gave me a great love for food and cooking. cant be all bad.
am I first . . . . to comment  yay!!oh  by the way  youre amazing in your natural look
melonie is 35 and looks like a 21  22 instagram girl  she looks great.I will take your health advise over a self-entitled nutritionist any day of the week.
can you include a link to your sources please  I need to add these highly educational facts to my ammo
2 things  1. Im sorry  but I have to be a man  and man-splain  1 hectare   10 000 m2  yes  its non-freedom units 2. I demand 1 good joke every 20 minutes  if youre going to make 45 minute videos. example   work with cows  not against them  melonie looks straight into the camera cow-a-bunga suckaz! as you can see  I chose a joke youngsters use nowadays  so its totally not lame.  p
a friend of mine claimed to get sick after eating her veggie burger off the grill where it was cooked on its own special  didn t touch meat  area. she has never looked healthy or normal her while life and she is on more pills then anyone can count. but cant stop people from harming themselves.
Imuch prefer flexitarianism as its just your standard vegetarian diet  but  still allows you to eat meat in moderation rather than every day  and it works! vegan diet actually caused my stomach to act up and nearly had to get my stomach pumped  its not great if you want to lose weight  plus   vegan fast food  is good  but I wouldn t recommend having it all the time. I like fish and chicken too much to give up meat
for me its meats first  vegetables second and that will never change.
when they say red meat is bad for you  they dont mean beef or pork. they mean the chemicals grocery stores put on meat to make the meat red is carcinogenic. meat is grey when oxidized. they make it red to make it I guess attractive to the consumer. they threw the red meat title to beef in general so they can continue selling the red cancer causing meat. I think they treat the meat with carbon monoxide to keep it red
so where does fish and other sea food fall into this equation because Im absolutely down for beef  eggs and dairy. but Im also a big sea food fan. also where do other meats like chicken stand on this
if you still have a link to that thread  I d like to read it
I really want to try a more meat-based diet  but I cant afford it  dont have the time  and most importantly  dont have any support structure. I work often up to 12 hours a day  and when I come home  I dont want to cook. Ive been on my feet all day  and I just want to zone out and veg  pun intended. no one I know is willing to look into the data  and just accepts the propaganda  and make no mistake  the original food pyramid is propaganda . I did try to do a this last week on just meat  using up all I had  and found myself completely out of energy before lunch. it made for an unbelievably miserable day  and it resulted in messing up my money really bad at the end of the night. I had to reincorporate a small level of  carbs after that just to have basic function. today is the last day of that week  and I dont feel great. Im hungry  Im tired  and I kinda just want to stop  but I need to make a change to lose weight. I dont know if I can make it work for me  and if I tell anyone Im doing it  I will be shamed. Im in an absolute lose lose situation  I think.
when I was vegetarian I was super fat
I just want to know why vegans insist on talking about being vegan at the absolute slightest opportunity
sounds like thats a point that needs to be raised more in bold letters.
@ookey bookey  actually  vegetable  especially  organic   require more land than conventional vegetables  and way more land than protein.
@dan liberty  true but both take a lot less than the land required to raise animals and the food for those animals.
@dan liberty  actually  animals need much more land than organic plants for the same amount of calories.
@dan liberty  soy protein  yes. but Im not talking about organic
agreed  there are people who are allergic to eggs. Im sadly one of them. egg whites specifically.
@ravenous raven  yeah  figured I d ask. I know there s like replacement egg whites  just curious.
also  one hectare is equivalent to 10 000 square metres  I dont know what that translates to in the imperial measurement system
I dont have a link  but you can find everything I put in the video from the twitter thread by carnivore aurelius. should be able to search it on twitter and find it
never will understand the concept of vegan meat...highly processed industrial food is the ultimate dietary mistake.like  come on man!
fish and any other meat is all carnivore
@melonie mac go boom  thanks Imight look more into this. never hurts to be informed on things that could make healthier
@enuma elish  salmon is the fatty kind of fish youre looking for  but all fish is delicious
he tweeted it like a week ago so itshould be pretty easy to find from his twitter. I d link it but Im on mobile and dont have it on hand atm
its not a diet  its a moral belief.
that Bible verse of the day was incredibly fitting. thanks for sharing
call me crazy  I dont listen to health advice from obsess person  same way I dont listen to hair care as ice from baldies.
you are correct. the saddest part is  as an example  I have a friend who s vegan and I ll try to tell her she s being marketed to by a billionaire land owner trying to sell you a product. she wont believe me because Im competing with gorilla marketing. he does not care about your health  he does care about your money. why are organic products more expensive  marketing. be careful because the marketing goes both ways.Im also guessing that there are migrant workers willing to tend to the farm a lot cheaper than americans working as ranch hands. I spent some time in a small apple orchard town in wa state and the population was mostly migrants that had state funded housing. wheird... grow your own fruits and veggies....if you can.
when I said your hair looked great and fine down I didnt mean for every single episode. can we get a little variety here
my nutritionist tried to get me to replace meat with other protein sources and just have a few meals with meat and that I can understand. however  we are omnivores for the soul reason that we need both meat and vegetables fruits to get the nutrients we need and sometimes that means more meat or more vegetables fruits depending on the individual
the video thatspawned enough tears to season my carnivore diet for years to come.
wait..... what were we talking about lol.seriously though very good information.
I dont get why a lot of these people call themselves vegan and cheat by eating eggs and fish  rather than just calling themselves vegetarian  which allows eating those things.
poison my libido !what a let down!  yes  I know this topic is serious  but I had to throw in a little humor anyway...
I had a question does that mean you should never eat vegetables  I like to eat both meat and vegetables  so should I only just eat meat
hImelonie. I agree with everything in your videos including the faith segments at the end. but in terms of plant based diets Im sorry. youre completely wrong. we re both the same age. Ive been plant based since I was 16. I live a perfectly healthy fulfilling life and I never fall ill of any viruses including covid 19 which Ive never received a vaccine for. I d love to have an open and honest chat with youregarding this topic. I dont wish to shame you or anyone but I do feel that through your content that you have a bias. Im also open to hear why Imay be wrong. let me know.
wow.. Ive never seen anyone that I actually wanted to have that orwellian term   influencer  until now. please influence people.
one of the things that make me angry when I think about the mono-farming in the us is that all we keep growing is corn and soy.  corn has been placed into almost everything in the us from food to fuel and soybean have the same proliferation in our foods and even our medicine. many countries have banned corn syrup because it has been linked to stunted mental growth and abilities.  soy tends to have more estrogen than the human body knows what to do with.  you want to know why we have an increase in emotional thinking   why we have an obesity epidemic   these are the key factors.
average vegetable fan vsaverage meat enjoyer
hey  mel! we used to debate on trf a long time ago. Im talking back to the early 2000 s. funny enough  we used to disagree on many things back in the day. I used to be a leftist. cringe I left that cult a few years ago  but thats another story!I was also vegan for over 7 years. I did it mainly because I didn t want animals to suffer and die for my palate pleasure. all the vegan doctors propagandists I used to follow also had me convinced it was the healthiest diet around. I thought that was just a bonus  but that was never my focus. when I was in the thick of the vegan cult at around year 2-3  I was convinced I d never go back to eating animal products. Im embarrassed to say I was one of those vegans you didn t want to sit next to during a holiday dinner. I was so passionate about the animals and I wanted to spread awareness to everyone. as the months and years passed  I became less excited about my future as a vegan. its extremely isolating in many ways and itstrained my closest relationships. and the vegan community  as you are aware  is toxic. even during my hardcore vegan days  I would be vilified by other vegans online for not going far enough with my veganism. but even the most avid vegan draws a line in the sand somewhere. the only perfect vegan is a dead vegan. as for my health  I was constantly battling issues with my mental health. my anxiety and depression reached levels I never experienced before becoming vegan. I was constantly hungry. Im assuming it was because the bulk of my diet was carbohydrates. I couldn t go more than an hour without eating something  and I d experience terrible mood swings. I never felt satiated. I was also severely deficient in b12. when I returned to eating animal products just 4 months ago  I have noticed a significant improvement in my mood and energy. I cant began to describe how liberated I feel now as well. so many sections of the grocery store have opened back up to me and it was like discovering food for the first time. what a feeling!the truth is veganism is human suffering. I suffered greatly emotionally and physically. I thank God that I opened my eyes to this divisive  hateful cult thats wrapped in this cape of fake virtue and compassion. of course  I dont want animals to die  but Ive come to accept this is a necessary part of life. I try my best to purchase animal products from local farms where the animals live a good life. thats the best we can do. I could go on and on about my experience as a vegan and what Ive learned  but I ll stop here. thanks for reading. Im not on trf often  but I hope to see you around the forum sometime. that place has become a leftist cesspool. haha! take care.
I agree with the majority of what you say about potential negative effects from a diet without meat. I like to have a mostly protein diet with a bit of variety for flavor but its good to pay attention to what you consume to help stay in shape. I always take my protein drinks with something that has a little fat in it and that has given me great results for years of high performance work. studying medicine for years has encouraged that as a good path to work with.funny story about eating plants  my brother and I tried chomping on the leaf from a random big plant out of the backyard garden once when we were little kids and had horrible reactions. dont try that game. anyway  keep being awesome and the commentary is appreciated. Bible quotes always a plus  too. thanks. goboom.
been saying this for years
the average life expectancy in america is 70. thats not if you workout and stay healthy. even with american s notoriety of fast food. Ive seen tons of people 50-100 pounds over weight in their 70 s and 80 s. Im in great shape health  btw. Im talking about people 400 pounds or more. they need to get in better shape. I dont think youre understanding what Im saying
the few good looking veg I canthink of  are all celebrity. those that can also spent 1000s of dollars into looking good.
wait  do you season your meat at all  do you eat mushrooms or other things that are neither meat or plant
agree.
soy has plant estrogen which has a negligible to no effect on humans. dairy on the other hand  has mammalian estrogen which directly effects humans as we are also mammals.
@mephitic miasma  I hear you and agree. thats why I consider most plants in the diet as just  roughage  or fiber. its useful for older people when they have digestive issues and want to move things along. not necessarily nutritional in value but it performs a specific function.
@aaron howell  fiber is essential is cresting a healthy gut microbiome  which is linked to multiple health markers. the bacteria in your gut literally feed off of fiber. fiber does much more than just help move your stool along.
I season my food and I eat mushrooms every once in a while  but not often. most of what I eat is beef and eggs
eating less meat and such is not a ad thing  but cutting it out completely is madness.
not that it matters but I will say your hair in this form screams jem and the holograms cartoon from the 80s. I think its better than when your hair was straight
speaking of veganism being like a religion to some people  more like a cult   if you ve heard of jenna marbles who s a very low-key vegan  there was a cute video she did some years ago where she went camping in her back yard and she and her also vegan boyfriend were making smores and apparently the vegan community bullied her because she didn t know that honey isn t vegan and there was honey in the s mores crackers they used. I dont remember which video she addressed it in passing but the poor woman looked so distressed over not knowing the vegan food laws. I wanted to hug her so badly.
why do you look brighter   argh my eyes I can see clearly
been a vegetarian for 25 years and I do 3 hours of shaolin kung fu a day. highly recommended for health and longevity. but what do I know...
this is all very interesting. Imight stick with an omnivore diet though but will probably put a 20 80 rule for this stuff. 80 meat  20 others. or at the very least  I ll try to cut junk food out of my life.
0 55  just look at patrik baboumian  conscious muscle  and miss meatless muscle
carnivore works. the biggest difference is the energy you have after like a week on it.
how many eggs do you put in your ground beef
Im kind of in a dilemma here  I want to eat the most healthy I can but to eat cruelty free meat I d have to buy from a more private farm and thats just too expensive. most of the animal meat we get in stores have been killed in extremely inhumane ways and thats just not something I can support. idk what to do
do you supplement the vitamins and minerals you dont get through a pure meat diet
22 10 - not the bees  not the bees!!!!
keep in mind...your 70s and 80s are the worst part of being alive...is it really that bad of an idea to just dip out early  then again who knows...Imay be the first person whose 80 years old and was pulled over for going 80...without accidentally falling asleep behind the wheel Imean.  p
ok but I hate bees. now I want to drink more almond juice.
I eat meat and veggies but way to much red meat will give you a fatty liver  constipation   and high cholesterol. but I guess it works different for various people.
had no idea you were on a carnivore diet. its work wonders for me. I had skin issues since I was in my teens. I was up to almost 300 pounds. now Im down to my highschool weight of 165 pounds  but I now have much more muscle than when I was 16. Im 45. all my skin issues have been clear  and Ive never felt better in my life.... physically or mentally. the only negatives I see with this diet are that Im not particularly a fan of eating fat or organ meat  but its something that I power through because the results are just far too amazing. congratulations on getting away from veganism. its definitely a cult.
hmmm  so I cant find your how I did it video for your diet when searching. either its suppressed or my blond roots are showing...or both
you should debate a vegan youtuber. possibly vegan gaze or lifting vegan logic  theyre usually the ones most open to debates. im sure they would be interested and it would be great content. I think its good to branch out into other communities and have discussions instead of creating an echo chamber where one just rants or cherry picks studies to push their views. debates are great for educating oneself and learning new things
how do you not get scurvy
Ive been waiting for this video and you did not disappoint. Ive been vegan for that last two years until about a month ago. I got tired of being tired all the time. super low energy and irritable all the time  as well as headaches  joint pain  brain fog and an overall feeling of exhaustion. and no  I wasn t doing it wrong. I was taking all the supplements and doing everything that all the vegan people said youre supposed to do. but still  my quality of life was not good. since I started eating meat again Im feeling soooooo much better  and I owe a debt of gratitude to you for helping to open my eyes to the lie that is veganism. Im going to go check out that  how I did it  video on your other channel now. thank you for all you do and keep up the good work! Im loving this channel.
you can blow their minds when you explain to them how many animals and insects have to be killed to grow the plants they eat. plants that are also alive and living things.
melonie mac is a real life super hero  if jenna marbles isn t dead  melonie can save her from the cult
@brad dl  approximately 7 billion wild animals die due to crop agriculture which is 10x less than the 70 billion that are killed for animal agriculture.
awesome! Im thriving on a vegan diet too. this is one thing I definitely disagree with melonie mac on.
@marvin tran  vegan and vegetarian are not the same thing
20 28
I dont supplement anything. beef has all the vitamins you need
@melonie mac go boom  there is only vitamin b12 in beef. a wide range of minerals but no vitamins apart from b12.just clarifying my intentions. Im not a vegan  vegetarian or anyone out to correct or debunk anything. I eat primarily meat with veggies. veggies to fill my stomach. I just dont see how a legit 100 procent beef diet works long term without any vitamin supplement. vitamin c for example is a major factor
@morelles  turns out you only need vitamin c to regulate carb intake and metabolism.if you dont have a over abundance of carbs in your diet  you dont necessarily need vitamin c.
red meat will do neither of those things  except maybe some cholesterol  but cholesterol is good for you. youre very brainwashed by food lies we ve had pushed on us with zero backing.
the cholesterol myth needs to die. a guy who I equate to being like trudeau in being full of shit  yet very charismatic  had pushed falsehoods on this. every study that was peer reviewed from 1955-1961 showed the other guy in the ring to be correct. their names escape me right now  sorry. the fact is that the more charismatic guy convinced the scientific community that cholesterol is bad. the other guy pointed out how cholesterol is not at fault for heart attacks when it is what is keeping your blood inside your veins. sugar was causing so much damage that the cholesterol congregated in mass to try to fix the vein walls. basically ldl is like the fire department and the house builders. the sugar is like a fire. when a house is on fire in a culdesac the fire department is going to probably be blocking the exit. that is normal. same in our veins. so stop setting your body on fire  and then blaming ldl  cholesterol   for coming in and stopping the equivalent of the great chicago fire from happening in your body. now that isn t aimed at you  that is just what he basically was saying. also cholesterol is also needed to be looked at not so much in amount  but the levels of all of the three together. that is what is more likely to determine a heart attack. so basically those unexplained  healthy  people who just drop dead from a heart attack are only seemingly healthy off of the falsehood of  facts  in our current general understanding of health. if we take in the information of the levels needing to be at a certain point together  then a lot of this will start to make sense. in other words the system that has been ignored will map out what is in front of us better then the old one. we also see this with the fact that a whole lot of vegans actually die from heart attacks even with low cholesterol. the newer data keeps proving the one guy right about ldl being actually good  and cholesterol being good in general. so look into this stuff before continuing to perpetuate that myth about cholesterol. also Im not saying cholesterol has nothing to do with heart attacks at all  but rather that most of the claims surrounding it are absolute bull. for example the amount of cholesterol they exclaim to be unhealthy is really able to go a lot higher before it becomes unhealthy. to much or to little of anything is unhealthy still holds true. the problem is the claimed amount of to  high  is false. farmers who eat a lot of meat but hardly any highly processed sugar keep going fine at an old age  while forty year olds die from eating less red meat supposedly. it literally is because of all of the sugar they take in  and not the meat.
you know Im something of a carnivore myself.
I agree with what your saying  I was  just wondering being a Bible based person what is your response when people say that in the beginning God gave us plants and seeds as meat and didn t seem to condone the eating of animals untill after the flood..
I think there are two types of vegans  the typical one is the one who purely just eats plant foods and the other is the type that doesnt eat store bought meat but rather hunt animals themselves just to eat. along with plant foods.
who  exactly are the  they  referenced in the thumbnail
how the heck is that dude 60 ! he could tell me in his mid-late 30s  and I d totally believe him! he did this by just eating meat  I couldn t really give up everything  but being healthier and more attractive means working out more and eating more good meat and protein in my diet sounds great to me. I always knew veganism was a scam  but I had no idea about carnivore. well  I heard it appeared to have done well for jordan and mikhaila peterson  but I had no idea that they were right that it was the carnivore diet that improved their overall health and healed their chronic illnesses so effectively. the fact that the global elitists want to radically reduce meat consumption and want to have our  rare treat  be grown from a petrI dish and a test tube says a lot about their intentions...
God is guiding you  I can feel it. you are blessed indeed. speak the truth  speak your mind. im happy to see it. thank you melonie! I can speak for what she says  I also had health issues. meat  protein  and vitamins helped me so much.
pride is the top of the list of sins yahuah hates. its like the root sin for all other sins.I have so many internal issues intestinal etc. that carnivore thing sounds so interesting. we eat healthy at my house. but all those veggies must be doing a number on me. Imean every night all those plants and barley and what not... hmmmm
never saw a full blown vegan that looked healthy.
so what supplements do u take melo
ok 3 things. 1st I love mcdonald s  mountain dew  and beef jerky. I am not giving these up. 2ed pride is something everyone needs  but dont go overboard with it. too much pride leads to bad things. 3rd first step to being better is always admitting when you were wrong. me am never wrong  me only miss speak.  me am awesome.
I agree for the most part my wife eats a lot of vegan food for the sole reason she has issues with dairy beef and pork so she has lots of vegen stuff but at the same time we eat have fish chicken and turkey for out meats! also I really appreciate the Bible verses at the end thank you for that!
for people who claim they go vegan because its  healthier  sure dont look healthy to us. embrace your inner carnivore.
issues with veggies is that they are far far less nutrient than they were 100 years ago. soil depletion  pest-control  etc has destroyed a food source that was once extremely valuable in the health of children and adults.
I love meat  but I wont cut out rice.
so carnivore diet its okay with dairy   I thought dairy was a  dont . I could do without carbs  but not without dairy stuff. milk  yogurt  cheese  etc is an everyday thing for me  lol
like kramer said to jerry   I dont argue with the body .your body tells you to eat meat. and it tells you to eat yellow squash if youreally have to.sweets and pantry snacks play differently because theyre unnatural. they are confusion for your senses.
is it true that there was a race of cave men that actually died off because they only ate vegetables
I should do a month of each type of diet. to experience it for myself. a month may not be longest  but I feel it could get a solid length to get a feel. just to feel which direction good for me.    I dont feel vegan is good. maybe the very very small percentage vegan could be good for someone  maybe  but I would argue it isn t.  so I agree with ya.
I tried to go without animal products before and nearly only veggies and dude you feel soooo weak  Lordy how to people get up out of bed on vegan diets I literally could not
I see many carnivore channels on youtube are growing in recent years. many of them being ex-vegans. this is perhaps the best way to counter veganism. your videos also contribute to that of course. great vid as always.
after adam and eve sinned is when people started eating meat  so before the flood. humanity and the world in general changed quite a bit after sin and death entered  that being one of them.
lol same
sure buddy.
I dont take any supplements
what about plant based keto
itseems that way because youre blinded by motivated. you d find way more meat eaters who look unhealthy but your reticular activating system filters them out. sadly  people value stories over statistics. if you want to play the anecdote game  here you go  Im a 35 year old actor. I regularly play characters in their early twenties  my levels are better than the vast majority of people and I haven t even had a cold in six and a half years.
a lot of people that go veg wind up cutting out the processed junk  thats why any diet that cuts the junk will lead to feeling better in some ways  such as paleo keto. if one s doing the keto diet as a veg they ll last a lot longer like I did but it requires eating a lot of salads and those only can be enjoyed fully organic. when your craving the sugar though youre in trouble  no matter what your diet. now that I eat carnivore I dont even crave produce at all.
carnivore diet is all animal based. dairy comes from animals and is a part of the carnivore diet. can stall fat loss if you overdo it though.
no.
often times when someone fails a diet  they swing to the other side and hate on the diet they failed at. any diet can lead to failure if not done well. Ive known people who said they were vegan for a month and felt tired. upon further questioning  such as  what were you eating daily     where were you getting your iron from    and  where were you getting your protein from    I have noticed that most people go from eating burgers to vegan burgers  pizza to vegan pizza  etc  or they go all the way to a raw vegan diet and are consuming just fruits and vegetables  a few other food groups here and there. Ive also met several people who claimed to have tried vegan  but upon asking them specific questions  they admitted they weren t totally eating plant-based. people say things all the time without accuracy. whether vegan or not  we have to have a balanced diet thatsatisfies nutrient requirements. iron  protein  selenium  calcium  and b12 are all actually quite easy to satisfy if someone knows what to eat. the world health organization states that iron deficiency is the top nutrient deficiency globally  so its not just a concern for vegans. b12 deficiency here in the usa affects approximately 40  of the population. I suggest you exercise caution when watching these carnivore channels. there s a reason you wont see a lot of scientific citations on them. if cited  many studies are funded by the meat  dairy  and or egg industries. reading studies can be dense  but often times you ll see that people manipulate the message of the studies! its really sad these days that people seem to take what they see from youtube at face value  rather than looking into the claims further. dont be fooled!
well  thatshould go without saying  we aren t herbivores or cows  we are built different  we are just like many other omnivores in nature  we need both meat and greens  a balanced diet is the best for most people  unless you have certain allergies or medical conditions like dr.peterson s daughter
I am a man...not a rabbit!!
Imean thinking about it you can raise cows and chickens pretty much anywhere on the planet so a low carbon footprint but vegans eat avacdo bok chois chickpeas which are all from different corners of the planet
balanced diet a little from column ab little from column ball the way to I had a v8with my ham samich with cheeseand meatetc etc etc
mostly meat is a very healthy lifestyle which loads of people have been coming around to the last 10 years  no processed grains and good fats.
if our ancestors thousands of years ago we re vegans we probably wouldn t be here today to talk about it. we re here because they ate meat.
hope yourespond to my earlier comment  melonie
brother in law is vegan. love the dude  but he is so scrawny he almost fell out of country fair ride! imagine being suspended upside down and being so slim that you could slip out.
we ve been lied about food a lot. a lot of sugar isn t good for us but for years nothing was said about sugar and it was trans fats  saturated fats and other stuff. I know so many people who ended up in the hospital while being vegan. we are better eating the diets of where our ancestors are from. some can eat more meat than others  some are better eating fish  rice  and vegetables  others can eat more fruit and vegetables with a little meat. we evolved to eat the foods of the areas our families lived in so europeans eat different than asian or middle eastern people. in the us we ve allow so much crap to be put in our foods.
meat is still the easiest and most efficient way to get a lot of the more essential nutrients for bodily functions. try as they might they cant quite come up with an optimal  replacement.
soil degradation is a serious issue. almost every developing nation which grows plants like cotton  tobacco  and corn deal with it. crops must be rotated to diversify the bacteria and nutrient content of the soil  or crops will inevitably fail. not only that  it can help support pollenating insects and helpful plants. wont catch vegans talking about that.
youre correct  the  7 deadly sins  is not in the Bible. it come from rcc philosophy.
ok  Im intrigued about carnivore but what about digestion  Ive heard all my life that red meat is really rough on the digestive system. also  vegetables provide necessary fiber to aid in proper digestion as well  so how can vegetables be  useless
meeeeeat!!!!!!
yup.  taught my whole life that meat bad vegetables good.  discovering the opposite is true made me more receptive to conspiracy theories.
thank you for bringing up the concept of bioavailability. Ive been preaching this for years! just because that can of green beans says it is full of this and that vitamin  does not mean your body can break it down and use it. most plant matter is indigestible and just passes through as waste. you only need a fiber rich diet to get all that fibrous plant based shit out of your guts. Ive cured myself of diabetes  a1c was 11.2. Ive been a flat 4 for multiple years now   and reversed other physical issues--no more high blood pressure  less physical pain from inflammation  etc.  only by changing my diet.
walter jr. looking at the veggie bacon   what the hell is this
the fact that you were wrong about veganism  isn t embarrassing. the fact you went through your own embarrassment about it is commendable. your not preaching your old ways cause you found it to be wrong. and for a woman to face her own embarrassment and wrongs is extremely rare no a days
so a balance of meat and vegetables is a myth
vince gironda one of the most chiseled physiques before arnold schwarzeneggers  time thrived on a steak and eggs diet.
at least the ground splat would be easier to clean up
@mephitic miasma  well  in his defense  the ride was built for the average american.
@ninja artist  hey  I resemble that remark!
its not efficient if you consider how much calories and nutrients a cow has to eat for you to get a 500gram steak
not on an industrial scale... just basic thermodynamics and food chain principles.. meat is pretty inefficient.
fiber is absolutely terrible for your digestion  as recent studies have shown  and also a giant scam to push veganism with. meat is not bad for your digestion at all.
@melonie mac go boom  didn t expect that answer. I ll have to look into it. this like the dancing isrealis of nutrition lol
@sammysam7x  dont listen to her. go look up the channel nutrition made simple! he s an actual scientist and researcher who s job centers around studying and researching into nutrition. he cites countless studies and looks into old and new studies all the time. he s unbiased as can be and even says animal products could be included in a healthy diet so he s not pushing any  vegan agenda .
1. meat  specifically beef  has the proper fats that help nutrients attach to the brain. 2. biblically speaking  there are animals approved for consumption. basically the biggest rule is dont eat scavengers. 3. I recall dr. michael savage  for those who know him  quoting from an article thatsaid that people who dont eat meat or eat very little of it are more likely to have a child with a mental defect.
I was borderline vegan for 3 months and I didn t even tell everyone I saw that I was a vegan.
I used to follow high carb hannah and plantiful kikI here on youtube  they seem to be doing really well on vegan but they are probably hiding things like u said just to try and make tons of money.
one other thing to consider on the moral arguements of eating meat. you cant domesticate animals that dont want to be domesticated. farm animals  allow themselves to be domesticated because it is better for them in terms of survival and guarenteed reproduction... same reason why dogs have become domesticated
I didnt make my way to the top of the food chain so I could eat grass and soil lol
7 deadly sins is particularly part of the catholic faith. in fact theres actually 8  possible more but only 7 are emphasize in protestantism.
dogs are omnivores. even wolves. cats are carnivores. thats probably why dogs eat grass. trying to supplement the lack of vegetation in their diets. dogs need around 70  meat and 30  vegetables for a balanced diet
boom! lettuce head-shot.
I wish meat was cheaper in my country  and the absurd is that this country is one of the greatest meat exporters in the world  the irony.I would totally go meat only easy  I did for a year but was unable to maintain the cost.
damn  weird. I remember following you on facebook like 4 years ago. odd you popped back up. beef fat is the way.
I dont think youre friend s problem was her diet. I cant talk about veganism but Ive been vegetarian more than 20 years and I never had any health issue. never had to take any supplements or making any special effort to keep a high level of proteins. but again  Im vegetarian  not vegan  and living in europe I have a very high and diversified cheese diet  d in my opinion  people preaching about their diet is a problem. do what works for you within what is medically advised. preaching for veganism is stupid but preaching for a heavily meat-based diet is equally stupid.
oh and just make sure you eat from all of the 4 food groups  beef  pork  poultry and fish.food pyramid is a  food pyramid scheme  better off putting items in reverse on that theme.oh and the keto high protein stuff being  bad for the kidneys  is bullshit.  drink more water!
just tell them that if God wanted us to be vegans he would have given us teeth like a cow.
I remember watching anthony bourdain was doing an interview where he criticized vegans for not having respect for the vegetables they ate.  he said that a steakhouse would outperform vegan restaurants in the taste of food.
you have a really small and smooth brain
watching this after grilling and enjoying some burgers and steaks. healthy living is about balance  I enjoy my meats while trying to include the green stuff
thing is  most crops are fed to the animals we consume  so I dont think what they say - that veganism kills more pests etc_ is correct... the only way to be correct is to have smaller farms that feed the cows grass etc. if I have goats in my garden for example and they eat what s already on the field  then yes they are better for the enviroment.not sure  still researching it.
what about fruit
there is very few veggies I like  I could never do it....I knew one person who was hardcolre vegan but he was also a huge drug user as the same time. it was ironic and funny
so what youre essentially saying is   if you want health and happiness  have some God and have some meat.
regarding unclean foods  in mark 7 19 Jesus declared all foods clean.
@melonie mac go boom  actually  Jesus was not declaring all animals clean  but rather clarifying that the food a person eats does not affect them spiritually. in other words  eating an unclean animal is a sin against your health  not a sin to the spirit of that person. the notation in the king james Bible in parentheses declaring all foods clean was added by man  that portion of text is in black  not red.
you cant dommesticate a zebra  for instance. wouldn t it be cool to ride a striped horse  why doesnt anybody do that  because if you go near a zebra it will bite you and then it wont let go until it tramples you dead. they are the deadliest zoo animal in the world  killing more people than any other zoo animal. I wonder if they taste good
as well as 4 stomachs to ensure we can effectively extract nutrients from plant food through  fermentation  rather than a single stomach that works through  putrification.
have you forgotten that in genesis it literally says that humans were vegan  it was only after the fall of man that we were no longer vegan.
@patrick ryan  whilst I appreciate your belief in the word  most animals are opportunistic carnivores and  the Bible has been translated and re-written so many times  by so many people  its impossible that the text has retained its original content as there would have most likely been bias and edits done by the very people translating the text.not only that  but it is no secret that the catholic church is withholding much information of the word within its vaults.so its rather difficult not to take what is written without a metric ton of salt.that aside  even science agrees that - if one ascribes to the belief of evolution -  and we are descended from apes  it is suggested the reason we ve reached this level of intelligence is that we turned to consuming meat out of necessity as a result of a reduction in our habitat due to the natural cycle of climate change - from a plant based diet - and  over millions of years the increase of b12 in our diets caused our brains to develop and our digestive systems to change into what they are today.however  it cannot be wholly confirmed as we merely have data with which to speculate - though it certainly offers a more solid theory. -that being said  it really doesnt matter what was  as itstands now  and from what meta-data and scientific papers show us is this  from the way our digestive system works  and the bio-availability of animal products we are an animal whose primary source of nutrition is that of other animals.to a lesser degree  observation of long-term vegans and the results of vegans pressing newborns  young children to follow a vegan lifestyle clearly displays that we are not suited for it as the human body currently stands - innumerable parents have been jailed  charged and had their children removed from them for manslaughter  negligence etc.  etc.  and the children who were saved and removed from these parents were severely malnourished and now look forward to stunted cognitive and physiological development. -may happiness and good fortune be with you wherever life s path may lead.
@cythreuilg  I dont think we are meant to get most of nutritional needs from animal products as they would have been pretty unreliable back when we had to hunt for it. our increase in intelligence is due to a number of factors  not specifically meat. cooking is one of the most attributed causes for our increased intelligence. Ive never even heard of a increased b12 intake being a cause of our increased intelligence and seeing as how we only need around 2mg of b12 a day and it takes 4 years for reserves to deplete I doubt it had any real effect on our increased intelligence. also if meat and b12 were so important to that then why are carnivorous animals not much more intelligent  why are animals like gorillas and other great apes wholly more intelligent we dont need the Bible to determine what we should and shouldn t do  especially since so many people completely misinterpret the Bible and its teachings. Gods word is written on our souls and thats all we need. we are able to empathize with other animals for a reason and seeing as how we dont need animal products to be of optimal health then it is wrong for us to continue to consume it.countless scientific studies have shown vegan diets to be healthy for everyone  including children. of course the diet can be done poorly  possibly thats easier to occur on a vegan diet due to needing to know to take a supplement and some basic knowledge of nutrition but the point stands that it is a diet that can be healthy for the majority of people.
depends on your goals. wouldnt advise if you want to lose fat  but if you are maintaining or bulking then a little bit of fruit wont kill you. its basically pure sugar though so I wouldn t go overboard with it. I personally dont eat fruit at all though.
@melonie mac go boom  thanx
yeah  its getting tougher now  because most of the food is genetically modified on some level. you go to the store  see some of the bananas  they re starting to get wonky and weird looking. same with tomatoes.
so you dont have an argument. gotcha.
@thom ervin why would I argue  Im a meat loving Christian.
lol. I got an almond milk ad right after you said it killed 4 billion bees last year. makes me feel like they are proud of that. also every picture on that vegans over 50 page  were just a bunch of random pictures that you would see on a dating site or facebook. there were almost no full body pictures or anything. what even was that  how was any of thatsupposed to be inspiring  and I agree  everybody I know not on a diet that are this old  look as bad as most on that page. great video as usual!
it reminds me of that meme where on one side it has some dried up 30 year old vegan woman to a 60 year old nigella lawson not only is nigella still extremely attractive at 60 she exclusively eats meat for proteins veganism is just stupid .
why not  they already have us stupid. may as well complete the package.
Ive never understood why people think its a good idea  humans are omnivorous for a reason. I think that a balanced diet is inherently better than a specialized one for most people.
Jesus loves you!
we could all benefit from eating less meat  especially red meat for our health and thats scientifically proven. the whole  meats are the only credible source of protein  argument has been disproved with a lot of these studies being funded by major meat distributors. not saying stop eating meat  enjoy everything in moderation - just know what it is that youre consuming and show compassion for others and their lifestyles
personally I do use vegetables  but I use them as a side just to make something like chicken  beef fish which cajun style blackened catfish is a favorite  but I digress.humans in the grand scheme of things are meant to eat meats.update  if you do have veggies in your meal definitely soak it in extra virgin olive oil to dilute to toxins in those and it adds to the flavor so its a win win.update 2  almond milk kills tons of bees  ok no more almond milk for me  because I am not killing the critters that makes the honey that makes my mead. something that I drink on those occasional big meal like thanksgiving or Christmas.
I cant place a comment  they keep deleting it!
the biggest issue with veganism and activists trying to push it forward  its not cheap. if youreally want all the amino acids  proteins  etc  youre going to be spending 2-3 times more than a random guy eating a 6 oz slab of meat each day. those gmo beans youre suppose to eat dont come cheap ya know and if youre not eating the right serving for your body weight... well at least you tried!if not just the cost  but trying to meet somewhere down the middle in terms of budget  the food suddenly becomes a chemical mess. if youre not eating foods loaded with sodium and other chemicals  youre more likely to eat food with additives that are banned across europe  but somehow through the united state s corrupt system of lobbyists  are perfectly  safe  for human consumption. I cant even imagine the long term health effects of fake  meat  products that are pushed to high heaven these days.people really need to start crawling out of their echo chambers and follow where the money leads. pharmaceutical companies have billions to burn on research  data and funding said research across the united states. guess where else those billions go into  the same politicians you vote in  to represent you. the same politician that would sell out your child s soul to help pay back all their campaign donators  which happens to be big pharma. you dont think these companies dont know they ll make more money the more unhealthy you become  that body positivity is just another convenient way of fattening up the  chickens  before harvest  keep taking selfies of yourselves  gorging on 3 000  calorie deserts  much less a seasonal drink at starbucks. the fact that you ll have boot lickers ready to scream conspiracies says enough of the climate of pre-programmed sheep. dont worry though  no one is young  healthy forever and no one knows this better than big pharma. while youre defending them for the clout and cheap  retweets likes  for your social creditscore  they ll be waiting far away to put a price on your life.
60 years old and a full head of brown hair  the lies speak themselves.
I experimented with semi-vegetarian years and years ago and hated the effects. it very well may not be the best diet for everybody  but for me  carnivore   vegan. period.
Im proof not a vegan though I eat hunny and cheese sometimes felt better then I ever felt since ditching the meat I tell ya one thing humans arnt meant for carnivore diet lol
this channel needs more controversy...otherwise  why is anybody gonna click on this bullshit.
one of my colleagues has been eating mostly vegetarian as long as I have known him.he s a great cook  so we ve chatted a lot about food and nutrition. I had expressed my own doubts towards plant based diets but respected his choice.yesterday he told me   yeah... Im no longer going to eat vegetarian  my bloodwork shows Im severly iron deficient the guy has hereditary haemochromatosis  he absorbs too much iron by default  how fucking bad does your diet have to be to be iron deficient with that disease ...
I didn t know that vegan diets correlated with mental illness  that explains so much!
it can be done in a  healthy  way  but 99.5  do not.  as for me  I ll stick to steak!as an irish guy I refuse to believe spuds are bad lol!
cow eats grass and I eat the cow.chicken eats bugs and I eat the chicken...and the eggs.pigs eat everything and I love my bacon.I d say my diet is pretty balanced.
to be fair your views criminally underrepresented. so who cares if you tell a mean joke. keep up the good work.
I always knew broccolI were evil and now I have the proof. . .. also  the vegan deterioration is crazy. ... Im on a   mostly   carnivore diet  with a bit of cheese or rice as my sources of energy. .. I do 6k five times a week and go lift a wee bit ... I am not trying to become magazine cover.. . I just love kebab and apple pie soooo much. ...
I eat it all. veggies  fruits  nuts  seeds  meat.. rise peter  kill and eat.
he may dye it  or he may actually have brown hair. my grandpa had jet black hair until he died. not everyone goes gray. a quick google search will tell you that nearly 1 10th of people dont go gray at all.
where are you getting 99.5  from
I agree veganism is very overrated and doesnt complete your nutritional needs but the reason why carnivore people improve health is because they are not consuming carbs  from bread  aka sugar so are essentially doing a keto diet. Im not sure it has much to do with animal products vs plant based products.
here s the question  if everyone in the world went for carnivore diet  would there be enough animals to sustain it for everyone all the time  wasn t the original point of agriculture to have more reliable source of food and beer  edit  what comes to antinutrients  isn t cooking supposed to get rid of them
real veganism has never been tried before...
I dont know how someone can picture meat consumption as a moral wrong when we know how difficult it is to consume the necessary amount of proteins in a purely vegetable diet. with a population of eight billion on this planet  it would be impossible to plant enough soy to satisfy everyone every year. anyone who knows anything about farming knows you cannot consistently farm one crop every season  every year. even if there were ten crops able to satisfy a the protein requirements of a human being--which there aren t--they would be overplanted and unavailable. it would require a much greater degree of manipulation to create enough plant-based protein to feed that many people.
on the 8th day God made steak  winked  and said  enjoy my dude .
just by the title alone would trigger richard  vegan gains . he ll likely see this vid and will either post a rebuttal or else flat out ask for a debate. richard is one of those who is fully vegan and will stick to it even if faced with data contrary to what he believes in.
- panda bears are an omnivore species that went vegan. ... now every birth is treated like a miracle.chewing 40kg of bamboo per day  which pretty much takes all-day  as their digestion isnt setup for it. why should we emulate that - food crops have been  the way  to feed increasing populations throughout history. there is prolly a lot of hold-over from that- a lot of the  devout preaching  - and that goes for both vegan carnies - appears to be based in self-reaffirmation Im doing the thing ... and if you do it too because of me  it means Im doing a convincing thing! preaching always has been wierd to me  but preaching about  a food plan   now thats just bonkers.
Im vegan   so is my unborn baby  dog  cat   so is everyone else who are just constantly lapsing everyday...!
so thatsenator who pushed for vegan school meals was caught eating fish !clearly he was not in the right plaice. . . !that one kid who probably cod him eating fish  pants down  youre the loser!
melonie your boomboom isn t.
the best diet is a balanced diet  a bit of this a bit of that.the enemy of health is lack of exercise and diet heavy in sugar and over eating.I have doubts about those studies  what was the first of the people before they started the meat diet   was it high in sugar and other processed garbage that just makes people fat.and what uneducated buffoon has told you eating vegetables is bad for you always double check the sources you use.  make sure they are from a recognised institute and peer reviewed.anyone can post anything on the internet and people will believe it.  science including food nutrition is knowledge  its not left  its not right  its not woke. just plain old knowledge backed up by evidence.so before you make a video about something like this.  double check  read and understand your sources.other than that keep up the good fight against those that run everything in the name of the message.
a  carnivore  diet still isn t the optimal diet for humans. we re omnivores by nature. we need both vegetation and meat. eating just meat  or meat and dairy eggs  still leaves you lacking in certain nutrition. plus a carnivore diet is high in saturated fats which can lead to higher risk of heart disease and sodium which has been linked to cancer.its literally the same problem that a strictly vegan diet has only on the opposite end of the spectrum. you still need to supplement your nutrition. if you dont think you do  than youre lying to yourself and youre lying to your audience.
veganism has become more of a religion than a diat. oh burger king is trying to pander to the vegan crowd.
I got these hippy boomer neighbors  one day they gave us some leftover vegan spaghetti. I had to throw it out it was so terrible.
and speaking of processed garbage  im noticing alot of so called vegans are kind of overweight if not obese lately bc their diet consists of like vegan sweets and other junk foods. my favorite is the stuff like  cauliflower boneless wings . so you think you are being healthy by taking cauliflower  breading it  frying it  and smothering it in sauce that is mostly sugar  meanwhile me eating a chicken breast with some lemon and honey glaze is bad for me  sure jan
yikes. on the one hand  its nice to see people refer to primary literature in forming an argument  but on the other hand  the biased cherry-picking and misinterpretation of the literature is disconcerting. there is a reason why comprehensive reviews and meta-analyses  i.e. looking at the entire body of scientific literature  rather than any handful of papers  come to the conclusion that animal agriculture is more harm than its worth.a good example of the poor interpretation here is the analysis of the un and epa reports on emissions. various subcategories within  agriculture  are directly and indirectly affected by livestock  even if not labeled as such. for example  the  soil management  category  which is the biggest chunk of the agriculture pie -- the cited epa report points out that nitrous oxide emissions in the us are particularly high in the areas producing soybeans  and the vast majority of soybeans grown are for animal feed. so regardless of the source of the direct n2o emission  fertilizer  etc.   the fact thatso many soybeans need to be grown to feed animals is the fundamental problem. then the second biggest chunk of agriculture emissions is from enteric fermentation  which is solely from livestock. and then in other areas of emissions  like transportation -- some of this transportation is for agriculture  whereas the  agriculture  pie consists of soil management  enteric fermentation  manure management  rice cultivation  urea fertilization  liming  and field burning  which do not contain all indirect energy  transportation  etc.  costs of agriculture .and this is just one of the problems in the analysis from that person s twitter feed. almost every point makes some similar misleading interpretation -- such as how not farming animals is better since no crop-dwelling wild animals need to die  which completely ignores that these livestock need to be fed crops  and more than we would need to grow if we fed on the crops directly  rather than feeding them first to animals over months or years  then feeding on the animal s body afterward  which necessarily involves an accumulation of these crop deaths just to feed the animal   such that not having livestock would also minimize the amount of this collateral death.the single point that I found valid was the very first one -- indeed  eating meat is not necessarily bad for you. but everything after this was nonsense.
its also not healthy to eat just meat as a diet btw  you need a mix of many different foods
Im not a vegetarian because I like animals  but because I hate plants.
why would a vegan justify eating anything that came from an animal when the whole point is not to exploit animals   either you follow the simple few rules  or you dont.
debate vegans gains
real communism has never been tried before
what  I haddock-come up with a punny line to cast. ok  I ll stop before I get too hooked. . . .
lol wrong. meat has everything you need
@melonie mac go boom  you should watch the game changers
cope
so suggestions for vegans and vegetarians who are concerned about animal cruelty  1  hunt for your meat. that way youre directly involved and  its probably close to cruelty free as possible. its also the most sustainable should supply chains collapse which given current events wouldn t be as surprising as I d like it to be. 2  farm your own animals. same applies although one could argue being domesticated sucks. in both of the aforementioned cases use everything you can and then return the remaining materials to nature where she can use them. 3  farm locally. its probably the easiest although youre least involved and thus in less control. if he s got buddies with hay or whatever and he s breeding his animals then he ll also survive supply chain collapses.
preface  I love  your videos. my views on society  culture and religion are pretty much inline with yours. Im not trying to be a hater here.but dude the way you approach the diet issues are kinda dogmatic. generally speaking I dont think any elimination diet should be the starting point for anyone in terms of nutrition. that being said for some people it works whether it be veganism or carnivore. I can care less about the dogma behind the diets - if it works  it works. I have a really good friend who is a bodybuilder that does physique competitions and he just placed 3rd in his regionals for physique. he hasn t placed above 5th in a 10 years that he s done bodybuilding. this was the first competition since covid ended and during covid he went vegan. he s not one of those judgemental cunty vegans that act like retards and pour blood on people or super glue their hand to starbucks counters. he s perfectly fine eating dinner with me  while I eat meat. he did it as a personal choice because of his love for animals  he just cant make himself eat meat anymore because he doesnt want to eat dead animal flesh. not everyone is a hyper political vegan. obviously he does a lot of supplementation and takes b12 injections. but just because he supplementing doesnt mean the diet isn t working  it means part of the diet is supplementation. I take supplements and was taking them while I tried on carnivore. are you saying the carnivore diet wasn t working because I was taking beta alanine and l citrulline or caffeine   is gfuel not a form of supplementation  .my buddy does what he does to make it work  honestly I applaud him because he made it work. it was certainly was a huge challenge. and I think we should view that as an accomplishment when vegans can be successful. Im not saying this is representative of all people because it isn t. but I dont think that we should be hating on a diet because for some they do get results  . personally Ive done keto  paleo  carnivore and vegan diets. none of them worked for me. not because I couldn t make them work or do them properly just because I didn t prefer them . the thing I think is interesting is that you call veganism a religion but there s dogmatic religious aspects of all of these diets including carnivore. I think that its equally dogmatic  in the way some vegans are  to say all vegans are stupid and are killing themselves. I dont understand why we need to turn diets in the team sports. maybe most vegans just aren t successfully doing diet properly. or maybe from a genetic perspective their bodies weren t meant to be vegan. maybe your body was meant to be carnivore because youre making it work for you.  I dont think its as simple as  this works that doesnt.  we are all different. we all have different tolerances. my mother-in-law has lupus and has pretty much cleared herself of a lot of the inflammatory issues related to the disease by going carnivore. for her it works. I dont think we should be treating people who can successfully do the vegan diet  like my buddy has  as if they re stupid or are killing themselves. he s not  he looks fucking fantastic and is perfectly healthy. and while I dont think he s getting the ideal sources of protein-if thats the trade off he s willing to make because of his views and how we should treat animals then thats the trade-off he s willing to make. but he certainly not killing himself and he definitely not stupid.
itseems like you ve gone from one extreme to another though.
the dalI lama is vegan but he still eats meat to have energy. says a lot about vegans  dont it
Im so confused. research says that high amounts of meat leads to heart disease  cancer    lung problems. how can eating just meat with no fruits and vegetables be healthy  please explain.
as robert scott bell would say   what s the best diet  whichever works for you.  we cant all adhere to the same diet. that is what vegans are missing. quality vs quantity is an issue. also  food preparation. if you dont prepare your legumes or vegetables properly  they will be harmful to your health. most vegans are not eating organic  so the pesticides and herbicides they re ingesting cripples their gut health. the main thing Ive noticed is that veganism is pro animal  but antI human. thats why no matter how much your health deteriorates  you must maintain the diet  because youre just doing it wrong.
have to eat meat to fuel the work we were cursed with. plant based diet was only good enough for lounging around in the garden of eden  munching from trees and laying with lambs and lions  but we blew it.

I actually feel better after quitting meat. maybe everyone should do what s best for them   I do think veganism only works if youre moderately rich and can afford it.
humans are facultative carnivores.... not omnivores.
Ive always been skeptical of the nutritional viability of vegan diet  but Im able to shrug it off. day in and day out scientists and nutritionists will flip flop on some specific food like milk or eggs being the holy grail or cursed chalice of nutrition. the whole  saving animals  part has always been the lead reason to go vegan  and then they slapped climate change on top to pressure people more.point being  scientists make studies  and some studies will diverge because guess what  confirmation bias is a thing. and we all have different metabolisms  so there s no catch all way to eating healthy  aside from avoiding extremely sugary stuff. that one a common denominator. great work as usual melonie  Im begining to add more red meat on my diet too since Im working out more. let s go  carnivores ps   how many soy boys can you lift     is a line Im adding to my arsenal
cain was a vegetarian. we deny an animals advancement to a higher level by not consuming them and allowing their flesh to become ours.
I try to eat red meat at least once a week.  I d never go vegan.
Im seriously considering going plant based  please dont hate on me.
plants is what my food eats. meat eater and women defeater!
hey melonie I just want to say that I think that carnivore is healthy and good for you bc it has beef and meat too and it will help you be healthy and stay healthy for a long time in your life  ok melonie. anyway I know that bc I have tried eating all beef and meat for a long time and it helps me to stay healthy and stay fit too  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to tell you that it is good and healthy to have carnivore to eat for your meals and for snacks too  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and make a comment to your video for today  ok melonie. anyway I hope you had a great blessed weekend and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed week this week too melonie. anyway have a good night melonie.
the seven deadly sins isn t canonical to the original manuscripts that are known as the Bible.
current literature on veganism already shows detrimental health impact  and continues to paint a worse picture as time goes on.
I shared this video with my militant vegan sister-in-law. her reaction... huh so  maybe another vegan saved ! or  maybe you get more hate on twitter in which case sorry about that lol.
8 minutes in. at best  these are simply anecdotes. very weak
@leroy  not necessarily. they could just increase prices and network with other people to create a decentralized network of people so that there s a bunch of local farmers helping people out.as for hunting  yes Im aware of that. thats why I specifically address the idea to vegetarians and vegans coming to the realization their lifestyle isn t working that also are still worried about animal cruelty
@jchoneandonly  why shouldn t it work to be vegan  all scientific data telling that its fine and even can have health benefits
@leroy  did you not watch the video or something  humans are persistent hunting omnivores. most of the stuff we need comes from meat.youre either getting that through dietary supplements  which requires a significant effort and a supply chain  or from munching on other critters.is possible to live vegan much like its possible to fire a 50 bmg round through a shotgun. it ll function but it will be sub optimal without a lot of work
@jchoneandonly  to keep itshort for my logic for veganism  there is no point in eating animal products to this day. the pros outweigh the cons by far in any morally  environmentally and health based argument. its just a habit thing to change your diet.about taking supplements  the only supplement you generally need is b12 and I see no problem with that  any argument s about it being unnatural or whatever makes no sense since 90  of the daily life of a modern human is  unnatural . unnatural doesnt equal bad and natural doesnt equal good all the time.about it being an agenda and from the elite makes little sense to me because the animal industry lobby is one of the biggest in the world while the veganism movement is still small af and is not pushed by the government as it could be if it was a big plan  only because it is was loud on the internet does not mean there are some bad people behind it.there are studies from the 80s who back the new  in your eyes  suspicious studies  up and back then nobody knew what veganism is.btw its nice  and important  to have a civilized discussion these days. thx
lol  then he isn t vegan by definition
its not  she has no scientific backgroundher arguments base on personal experience and not eating a balanced vegan dietall of the leading academies of nutrition can recommend a vegan diet and even saying it has health benefits   vegetarians and vegans are at reduced risk of certain health conditions  including ischemic heart disease  type 2 diabetes  hypertension  certain types of cancer  and obesity.
@leroy  no offense  but you have no scientific background either   you just copied pasted that. I need to hear melonie respond to me on this  not you  random user with no image
@mr. lock  yeah but my sources are scientific lol  you can look it up for yourself instead of asking a random youtuber pls check some nutrition academies for example  usa  canada  portugal  australia and so on
@mr. lock  but he has a point regardless lol
@jon m  no he doesnt. lmao
@mr. lock  yeah because u dont wanna listen to scientific consensus lol
go watch the channel  nutrition made simple!  he s an actual scientist who works in the field of nutrition and has the credentials to be talking deeply about the field. he s always making videos looking at tons of studies when it comes to nutrition and breaks them down for people to understand more easily.
@patrick ryan  yes  patrick. Im glad you are also aware of that channel. there s so much bs online  so its good to point people in that direction. I like that he approaches everything and everyone  regardless of their stance  from a scientific viewpoint. science doesnt lie  but there s plenty of people who will manipulate the message of the findings. plenty of money poured into some studies by big industries. its painful to see so many people getting flawed information these days and not doing further research.
@ian marshall  yeah  nutrition made simple! isn t even vegan either. he even says diets including meat could be healthy. he does a very good job at just looking at the evidence and thats all
@patrick ryan  as far as I have seen from his videos on his personal diet  he consumes plant-based. he s made several  what I eat...  videos  even when he traveled to japan and portugal  and he always eats completely plant-based foods. I haven t seen otherwise but Imay have missed a video of him saying otherwise. but as far as being  vegan   I agree he s more of a plant-based advocate. some people dont understand the difference. but I dont think there are many vegans who claim that eating very small amounts of animal products drastically increases health risks. for vegans  its more about animals. its pretty sad people are getting sucked into the anti-vegan community though  since they re spreading a lot of misinformation and harm to animals and health. thanks patrick  its always nice to hear from other people who are aware of plant-based benefits. have a good day.
@ian marshall  you too man
Im mexican and live in mexico  a third world country  and Im not rich not even moderately rich  so no  youre full of it  almost 7 years being vegan
says who
I know  thats why I said that haha
@melonie mac go boom  I heard  written for clarity s sake.
nice clueless ramblings with even more clueless experts in the comments...
but we need the vegans when the apocalypse happens and the cows are all gone and we are forced to eat people the vegans will be our new cattle all we have to do is feed them grass to live until its time to eat muhahaha.
I agree meat is good. praise Jesus he died on the cross. Jesus did rise from his grave. Jesus ascended into heaven and his father God will send him back to save israel from the evil one and judge the living and the dead.
another ex vegan video with no scientific background and just nonense  for the people who are taking advice from a random yt girl  pls check all of the leading food academies e.g. usa    it is the position of the academy of nutrition and dietetics that appropriately planned vegetarian  including vegan  diets are healthful  nutritionally adequate  and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.
how s oatmilk meat is expensive.
when it comes to diet  dont go full plant based  dont go full meat based either  eat whatever the fuck you want  the key ingredient to living a healthy life is balance
I feel sorry for you
well most dont do it right haha its true but then again not a vegan but please get off the meat diet terrible for ur heart
my guy here still brainwashed. lol. sad.
@remus ventanus  Im always willing to change my mind for valid arguments  but calling me brainwashed is some low level insult lol
believing all the propaganda from the seventh day adventists.
