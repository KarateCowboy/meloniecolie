the fact they openly and proudly said tolkiens work needed to be adjusted for a modern audience shows just how arrogant those people were. they were so full of themselves in expecting people to love their work.
amazon learned the hard way why these showrunners were constantly rejected by other companies.
gotta say  watching all this woke stuff slowly fall apart has been absolutely beautiful!
its amazing how  the rings  really look like out of a bubblegum machine. the original one ring in the  lotr movies is just perfect. so simple  timeless and it looks massive
what I love about this situation is that the name and legacy of tolkien have not been tarnished in any way. his fans  knowledge of the lore and legendarium turned the tables on the wokies  making rings of power nothing but a 24 7 mockfest.  also  melonie   epic rap battles  just dropped a  lara croft vs indiana jones  video that I think you ll get a kick out of.
unless season 2 starts with celeborn coming out of the elf shower and galadriel waking up with a start saying  oh I had the worst nightmare!  there is no hope for this show.
the biggest flaw was giving the project to two inexperienced showrunners. the series had three directors  three cinematographers  and seven writers  two of whom were the showrunners  but the showrunners were the only consistent managing creative presence across all episodes. if they aren t removed  there s not much hope for season two.
how in the world do you fix something literally burned to the ground  pretend thatseason one didn t happen  thats a huge hill to climb. further how do you trust amazon after finding out they have lied this whole time  amazon has lost creditability  how do they fix that  great job mel!
they also used lots of  forced perspective  filming to make the characters appear to be the correct size. the special features content with the extended edition dvd s shows exactly how they pulled it offhow they did it  its really awesome. making the 6 1  john rhys-davies the size of a dwarf is no small feat!
my suggestion  make all of season one a nightmare that galadriel has. and the recast galadriel can say  what a terrible dream. I didn t even look like myself in it. I looked more like a human and acted like a spoiled brat.   actually  you could have her having flashbacks of this throughout season s  two and possibly three  as a nightmare showing galadriel her dark side and her vowing to never  be like that pathetic weak version of herself thatshe keeps seeing in her visions.  it can be what she sees when she looks into the water and it terrifies her. itshows her darks side and her fears thatshe could have created sauron and make be attracted to that. and she can point out all of the  inconsistencies  of her dreams. how it only felt like years and not millennia  and how it did not fit the actual history of the elves. and how hobbits were evil. and female dwarves had no beards.   with a competent film company  there could be so much meat to this story.
house of the dragon gets better with every episode. I was not expecting much going in and thought the first episode was ok but by the time the last episode ended I had goosebumps. just my take.
my biggest issue is that galadriel never hunted sauron. there are lots of other problems  like how galadriel was ban from the undying lands  and she said she didn t care to go anyway. the only way to fix some of this is to remake the entire first season.
so amazon hires two show runners with no experience which lead to the rings of power s failure  Im shocked I tell you.
they cant fix something after drastically changing the lore in every imaginable way even down to the creation of the rings of power themselves.
I am not sure anything can be done to  fix  the trainwreck that is the rings of power. it was not the love letter to tolkien that it claimed to be and the generations of people who invested time and energy over their lifetime cultivating a love and appreciation for tolkien s works were not amused let alone pleased with that trash heap.
the ultimate problem with the showrunners -- and the entire show  really -- is the fundamental lack of respect for the source material. its like what beau demayo said about the witcher show. someone who s inexperienced but a passionate fan will come up with something infinitely better than whatever the fuck amazon shat out.
one of the biggest problems with reinventing a property is that you cant just go back to how it was before you burned it down.
exactly!!! existing fans are a free meal ticket! they just threw us in the trash and said  we ll make new fans!! better more inclusive fans!!
I love it when you get to a name you cant pronounce  and you try anyways. hopefully we wont get any bot fake melonie accounts trying to give fake prizes this time. I haven t seen house of the dragon. and I only saw one episode of game of thrones  and that had stuff I didn t want to see so I stopped right there. thanks for suffering through rings of power for us. the finale review you did still make me laugh. great video  love ya melonie. looking forward to the next video. take care and enjoy your day.
in order to  fix  something  the problem must be identified in order for a solution to be implemented. amazon   what problem
they wont acknowledge that just because they think they have their new ideology thats meant to replace the past it doesnt make it compelling to others to view. lotr was an example of how Christian themes can be part of stories that weren t Christian. their modern retelling requires that basis to all be thrown out
the problem is not say or think that. maybe it is a honest thought. the problem is doing that by the hand of two amateurs. changes can be done in a proper and respectful way. the biggest problem with this show is not even the infidelity with tolkien s work  and yes  this is also a problem . the biggest problem here is just the writing and acting. it is horrible. if you disconnect this show from Lord of the rings universe  still being a horrible show.
not just arrogant. one could say its patently evil.
spot on. these people aren t what fans pay their money to see. we are hear to see tolkien s lore brought to tv. we are not paying to see them change his works as they see fit. the arrogance of these people to think that their message is more important than tolkien s.
imagine the absolute hubris of thinking  yes  I can fix the life s work of this professor of anglo-saxon and english language and literature. he clearly didn t know what he was doing.
modernizing means terrible and cringe writing
do yourealize that the past  starting from yesterday  has been actually abolished   .. every record has been destroyed or falsified  every book has been rewritten  every picture has been repainted  every statue and street and building has been renamed  every date has been altered. and that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. history has stopped. nothing exists except an endless present in which the party is always right.
fool me once  with star wars  shame on you. fool me twice with lotr ..shame on me
@gustavo rocha  no. the problem is saying that. tolkien s work never needed updating or rearranging. it was just stupid and unnecessary and disrespectful to what came before. tolkien s work was and is still loved by many people generations after he even made the damn stories. does thatsound like it needs updating for a modern audience  no. peter jackson made some changes but he didn t update it to fit a modern audience. he did his best to capture the stories told in the time they were told and thats why people love the lotr trilogy. amazon s situation is not the same at all. they simply wanted to pervert and destroy what came before. they failed  miserably.  update to fit a modern audience  automatically means  subvert the materiel  disrespect it  and blame the fans when it fails . that is a problem within itself  so no  saying or thinking that is a problem and it is the problem that has plagued all these franchise for nearly a decade. stop modernizing everything. its not needed. a simply good story will have universal appeal. its not hard.
they were rejected by bad robot of all places  the home of jar jar and klutzman. thatspeaks volumes. and the showrunners said in an interview that they wrote scripts thatshouldve been made. the hubris is overwhelming.
I frankly dont think amazon will ever learn  and season iI will probably be the same because the foundations of what they have done are flawed.  same problem disney star wars has.  while you can polish a turd all you want and make itshiny  its still a turd.
@icepicjoey   sheer... fucking... hubris!!!
well as a process of season  number 2  being made and reworked expect a shortage of turd polish.
@icepicjoey  eh  I read the article from them and it wasn t as you put. its more like they were working on a star trek 4 for a long time and it was very close to being made  but sometimes things dont come to fruition.
@paul w  Im guessing its 1984 right
@blacklives orblackvotes  far from me to saying the tolkien works needs any updating. I just said that adaptation and changes can be done respecting the original work. just respect the limits. I aggregate with you  the did not respect the limits and failed ridiculously. no argument on that. they just use the  diversity  thing as a shield. as I can see  they care nothing about that  it is just a shield for they use against critics. but once again  the biggest problem there is that even if they did not change the lore  did not adapt to the modern audience  I do believe the show would be equally bad. they have no idea about how to write a tv show  being for tolkien universe or not.
and now they can openly adjust their work outside the studio
it was a failure from the conception of the idea
nothing needs to be adjusted to modern audiences. if you want a show for modern audiences create your own show.
@adam tr     lotr was an example of how Christian themes can be part of stories that weren t Christian. their modern retelling requires that basis to all be thrown outits weirder than that. payne and mckay actually are  religious   they ve said so.  payne is publicly a mormon  mckay I dont know . the religiosity is right in there  its just coded so the dumb audience doesnt see it. case in point  miriel and elendil s conversation in ep 8. they are actually discussing the gift of men i.e. death. but thats not exactly mass market entertainment so they use vague  supposedly uplifting language which said audience  applies   in the tolkienian sense  to any damn thing it wants. or so they hope
@mrpwmiles  however tolkiens Christian message was more of a focus on how the goal to destroy evil or seek power to control it ultimately subverts you. you have a role to play and God iluvatar acts through you provided you act from love. eg gandalf saruman being a direct comparison of one who refuses power to one who feels good is served by controlling evils forces
fukamazon
this sounds like fake news and fans celebrating for nothing. jd payne and the other guy will do just as much damage in the writers room as they could do and have done as showrunners. if amazon doesnt fire them completely  we should all continue to boycott the series  and amazon prime in general. you shouldn t attack the fans like that and keep your job  not even in a  reduced  role. and being in the writers room  responsible for the literal backbone of the series  the story script itself  is not much of a reduction at all!
they are a literal representation of the south park episode where everyone loves to smell their own farts.
@adam tr  what Christian themes  I didn t notice.
@1flyingfist  are you being sarcastic
@kathryn  these days  yeah.
@gustavo rocha  I agree if you take a bag of shit and put it in a different bag its still a bag of shit.
@adam tr  no. but I used to go to church years ago though.please explain what you mean. Imight ve been unaware of what I was seeing. or you may have interpreted what you saw differently to what I saw.Ive never heard anyone else mention Christian themes from when the film came out  until when you mentioned it.
@1flyingfist  its a world guided by divine providence  it is outside the ability of people to fight evil  only to play their role when illuvatar calls them  and to do so for any reason except love causes them to fall. all the characters fight the temptation to seek power to fight evil  eg saruman and gandalf are intentionally using opposing ways to fight evil  gandalf according to preservation and love whilst saruman believes that by controlling the forces of evil you can stop them and achieve the greater good. frodo doesnt succeed to fight evil  it was just through mercy towards gollum that evil was able to destroy itself. frodo survives with the awareness he wasn t strong enough to fight evil  but he played his part
@bastian wright  you can add the witcher especially from now on as henry has departed. and pinocchio real life version. all not staying true to the source material on multiple points that were crucial to the story
@danny baars  all will destroy their respective franchises as we know them.
woke or not  if the storytelling is abysmal  no one is going to care what  type  of social category its in.
the price has been too high though.
@michael valdez  there s a strong correlation between woke and poor writing.at woke companies  the creative atmosphere is very poor. they re afraid of uttering anything even mildly offensive or they will get a mob after them and be canceled in two seconds. this creates a strange atmosphere where people are afraid of critizing each other. if you ever watch twitter threads of people in woke companies in media and video games  all these employees do  designers  artists  engineers etc  is praise each other to the skies constantly. its totally inauthentic and crazy. therefore it becomes rare to hear constructive criticism. people tend to only praise each others work  which allows junk to be included in the final product.and obviously woke entertainment and cultural production is very politicized. they have a distorted worldvied. poor understanding of human nature and what makes for interesting conflict and morals. and many topics are outright forbidden.
@phantom starlight  like my rent!
exactly.  a show titled rings of power and a billion dollar budget couldn t come up with 3 cool looking rings   this is money laundering 101
@the spaces between studio  especially since they basically didn t need to come up with anything  the designs for the elven rings were already made for the trilogy. so just take those designs  maybe change them just a bit his they cant use the prop but dont tell me that elves of all people would put unshaped gems on their most sacred items since the silmarils
you are right about that. but the chances of seeing a tv adaptation of middle earth s 2nd age in the next 10  years have been impacted quite a bit.
yes its called the butterfly effect. yes we mock the hell out of rop but theres no chance we ever going to see someone else try...someone else without biases and without propaganda...but no  amazon fucked that up forever
nice dallas reference. it is dallas right
@adrian rocha  it is indeed a dallas reference  its stuck with me because I remember my mother being particularly annoyed when it happened!
they also did that on married with children.
the second biggest mistake was letting them talk  endlessly  about the show and to the entertainment media  and treat the entire promo campaign like a rolling scrimmage of politics  preemptive strikes  gaslighting  and manifest untruths. the pr wing of the studio really needs to be reined in  but by this point they probably only have one dial setting  fanbaiting and damage control. jennifer salke may think this is fine  since thats the side of the biz she comes from  but on the basis of reaction and results  I cant see that it mobilized viewers  held them  or enhanced the show - it cheapened and diminished the show. diminished further. the showrunners should be rolled out for set pieces before and at the launch  and maybe a mid-season burst. otherwise keep them off the air  preserve some mystery to the process  rather than arguing about the exact merits of the sausage machine they are tending.
@mxvega  everything you ve said is on point. there s a cold  hard sociopathy to their pr  a sense that there s no card they wont play to get attention  be it negative or not. and yes the two showrunners certainly are in love with themselves and the sounds of their own voices. Im kind of wondering what cards they have left to play to push season two  I ll guess sex and sexuality and more promises of  canon  segments of the series  they ve already said some of that .
@guy gadbois  naked galadriel! naked sauron! oooo  naked gandalf! wooo!
@marc blanchet  dont forget durin and disa! or an elrond and celebrimbor hook-up where they try on rings you dont wear on your hands . . . Im going to stop now.
sometimes you strike gold with inexperienced people but they have a respect for what they are doing. these guys problem was they were arrogant thinking they could improve tolkien - writing the book tolkien never wrote and all that. and that arrogance was coupled with sheer incompetency.
@guy gadbois   who knew pointy ears turned on sauron
@james goodman  these two  thats who.  p
@james goodman  got to say our man sauron dodged a bullet on that one.
@guy gadbois   even on middle earth the hot fun is never worth the crazy.
have galadriel jump through the screen she hulk style and rewrite it lol..
yes  best move is to scrap everything and re-build from the ground up  but since their second attempt would only be marginally better anyway  Im content just watching them fail over and over trying to continue from a dumpster fire as their starting point.
@bud the cyborg  yup. we ve seen how messy its been for dc trying to do that instead of just starting over.
I agree  even if they started completely over  they called tolkien fans racists  sexist  and fascist adjacent.  pretty much impossible to recover from that.
how in the world do you fix something literally burned to the ground      -- indeed! -- season 1 isn t just the foundation of what s to come  its the origin and source of the tools with which you have to do the work.  you cant  retool  core  fundamental choices that are just bad.  this presentation iteration of galadriel is foul  the primary mechanisms of the plot and main characters are bad and ill conceived -- you cant overcome that without a long  painful rehabilitation and even then its going to be limited in what you can get done.   you can change how you dig a channel  but if you start with a broken shovel -- youre only ever going to accomplish so much.even amidst all the financial success and critical cheering -- this was exactly my problem with star wars the force awakens.  it didn t matter what good was suggested or what the next two movies might do -- there was no  undoing  the reset of rebels v. empire after that film  they locked themselves into repeating the arch narrative of a previous beloved trilogy ... dooming their movies to an unfavorable vector  and also an unwinnable subconscious comparison .    I think rings of power has already made too many fatally poor  core choices -- I think it can be ameliorated  rehabilitated  but I believe the possibilities for it to be  phenomenal  are already forever gone.
did you watched season 1
@                tried was done after 4th episode   it was bad on so many levels  didn t make any sense and was boring beyond belief.
rop attempted it but it looked cheap and was very inconsistent.
@flyfishermanmike  rop did not look cheap what are you on
@i4got872 ytp  Im specially talking about the use of forced perspective.  its easy to spot and looks cheap and quick. overall the show is beautiful.  about the only good thing I can say.
@flyfishermanmike  there are likely ones you didn t notice- did you watch the corridor crew vfx artists reacts to rop  there is some cool forced perspective stuff I think. but if a few looked bad and stood out  thats fair too.
there problem was not their lack of experience but their ideological bias and huge arrogance. in any case there is no hope for season two  because season one happened.
great idea
that makes me thinking  anyone has more creativity than the show-runners of this show
and how the elves looked like boy band members
the booby ewing is dead  season of rop may be the only way to save this dumpster fire.
wow this actually could work! nice one
Im down with that if they call it the nightmares of the ring.
agree except for the part where you said it  felt like years not millenia  when the entire rop show  barring the intro war against morgoth  takes place over the course of about 2 weeks.
I can live without female dwarves having beards.
@th6780  - I can live without the amazon rings of power
I agree.... there is a lot I dont lik about the show... but it definitely got better and better... and yes that final episode was pretty dam amazing.
it was a really well put together season  character building was great and the writing just got better and better as the season progressed. acting was also top notch for the most part  the actors were all good to great and they had a great script to work with so there were compelling performances all round.
no. house of the dragon was phenomenal from the very first episode. it beats any season of game of thrones.
@gulan hem  yes
heh. also  I am quite sure thatsauron was never pining for galadriel. because in that  show  he is probably going to be evil because galadriel rejected him.
remake it all  I loved the galadriel from the books  a bad ass super powerful sorceress not some two warrior.
galadriel s character ruins everything. she ruins the otherworldliness of the elves and valinor with her scene at the beginning getting into a petty fight over taunting. she s hunting an enemy no one has seen in 1000 years which ruins the original lore as to why sauron was successful in his deception. he came to the eldar 1200 years after morgoth s defeat so even for the elves it was so long ago that they wouldn t be so suspicious but if you have someone actively seeking a bad guy by name for a millennium it puts that bad guy more in people s minds rather than half-forgotten as it originally was in the lore. all of this and more is why I agree with you that they need to remake the entire first season.
so you ve watched the show   like no offence but why should we care for the opinion of a person who didnt knew better not to watch it at the first place. you watch   money for the studio so they keep making this crapfair or not the core issue is  you  watching it.
they should start season two with galadrial waking up and sauron walks out of the shower all  hey babe  - boom  season one was just a dream.
well not thatshocked
@fortehnguyen  maybe just a little shocked
it reminds me of the story behind the original super mario movie. cinemassacre has a great video on it.
they had valuable trump hating experience though.. I wonder why that didn t help..
exactly  just cast rop into the fire!
@ivanafterfive  cast it into the seathe sea is always right
my suggestion is turn all of season one into galadriel s nightmares. turn this trash into a feature and ridicule it in the rest of the seasons.  it can be saved. but it would require courage. and talent. and humility.  all of these appear to be missing from the  creative  team.
@ivanafterfive  exactly. burn it  incinerate it. there s no point in trying to salvage this mess. you ve attacked the fans. its a done deal. we need to stop giving these people chances. chances aren t for everyone. sometimes you just need to let them get hit by life s harsh lessons.
it cant be fixed  mor mazon  has equavalently sacked the literary osgiliath equivalent of professor tolkien s lore and story with season one  it is a descration of  history of the elvish speaking tongues..we have our exsurge tolkien position that defines it.
haven t seen the witcher show...does it not respect the source material
@haywoco2  I haven t seen it either  but according to a video melonie made basically yesterday  one of the showrunners said thatsome people working on thatshow actively disliked the books and the games.
I never understood the whole got phenomenon. the acting  design  cinematography  and vfx were excellent. but the characters were all such horrible people. every single character was a terrible person doing terrible things constantly. it was so gratuitous it came off unbelievable and nauseating. I get enough of people constantly being horrible watching the news. I dont need thatstress in my entertainment too.
dont think this dumpster fire is fixable  but that just means more geat videos from melonie! youre awesome melonie  keep up the great work.
I liked some of the dwarf stuff also it was exactly the amount of failure that I swear everyone expected
this show makes the hobbit look like a masterpiece and Lord of the rings the holy grail
they need to sack all of the writing room if the 2nd season stands any chance... if any of these writers stick around then its doomed.
this show gives me hope that anyone can be a writer
I figured it out. this is what happens when you only hire fanfiction writers  not original actual writers with experience or at least comprehension of basic storytelling. I like fanfics  dont get me wrong  but the entire concept of fanfiction is built on writing follow ups based on someone else s worldbuilding... all the reboots  sequels  prequels  spin offs  everything like that nowadays feels like a fanfic to me. and itstarted around 15 years ago  when people growing up on these stuff that went through  and still go through apparently  fanfic writing phase entered workforce and internet allowed them expanded reach of their works and voices  making a false sense that there are more of them than not  and so writing and producing things that works for them should work for everyone. news flash  it doesnt  not most of the time...
its not just the showrunners. its the actors  writers  director s   fx team...its everything. they would need to completely retcon the first season and start everything from scratch from the ground up.
if rop were a good show  there would be no competition  I d watch them both. its not like they are both playing at the same time and I have to chose one or the other.
I haven t watched rings of power yet  and at this point I dont think I ever will
there is no way to re-tool this show. they absolutely would need a complete re-do. new writers  actors  script  etc..
love the pov you have on this.  tolkien was aggressively opposed to putting modern politics into fiction  he is probably spinning in his grave over rop.  the rop isn t a lotr prequal  it throws cannon out the window in nearly every aspect.  at most its a spinoff of a world based on lotr like any other sword and sorcery fantasy setting except its woke af.  they have done what they ve been doing with all other fiction settings which is get the rights too them in hopes of selling more by using the titles name and reputation while destroying any concept of cannon or story progression cohesion as they smash every bit of woke idealogy they can into it and then blame accuse the fans when the fans voice their disapproval or show it buy not purchasing watching.  if they do this garbage with the witcher I will cancel my subscriptions and sell my tv s
I think there are some ways you could fix some things  the issue is they opened up so many plots and basically ruined every single one  that in order to correct all  you would create an even bigger mess.here are some points how I would fix some things just from the top of my head and if amazon sees this  pay me a million and will put some effort into this and fix your show.-galadriel  after her reckognizing thatshe took sauron into the heart of elfdom and thereby threatend the existance of her race  she gets humbled  hangs up her sword  abandons the stupid vengeance plot and becomes an adult  starts to study and starts the way to become the galadriel from the books and films.-rings of power have been crafted  for elves at least  but they dont have power yet  in creation of the other rings sauron or annatar assists the other races  like in the books  and teaches them the magic ritual to imbue the rings with power  which is then also used by the elves to empower the rings. fuck the metallurgy plot.-numenor  they start real military training and some genetic optimization  become an actual comptent leader  build up their tiny harbor and fleet and become the numenorians we all know from the books.-halffoots  they travel to the dwarf kingdom  travel the path down the mines and fight the balrog with sticks and stones until they all died. morkoth frustrated by the balrog killing the most evil people in middle earth sends the balrog back to sleep.-the dwarfs start mining the mithril  discover that the elves were wrong all a long and mithril has no connection to the tree that never existed  but is actually an ore.ok some of it is sarcastic  but I think there are ways to fix a lot of what they have done  but they miss the important part of fixing  reckognizing that they made mistakes.
Im afraid that fixing the show is impossible now. the damage is already done. they would need to totally erase season one  pretend it never happened  and start again out from scratch. but the problem is that happened.
unless galadriel wakes with a start from a nightmare... they write off the whole of season 1as a premonition then they re well and truly screwed
here s the thing  Ive read and heard about some brilliant movies  franchises and tv series that were based on an idea concept that was scribbled down on a frikking napkin  or some scrap of paper  and then shared with just the right person at the right time. no extended publishing route  no red tape madness and four levels of middlepersoncorruptors  just a good idea noticed by the right person. I have been fighting industry gatekeepers  warner   disney  amazon  netflix  etc. for three years to get someone to look at a five part military sci-fI epic Im working on  which is farking brilliant  and the five movie pitches are ready  but its easier to breastfeed an angry anaconda on horseback  blindfolded  than it is to get in touch with key people in the industry. meanwhile they continue to make shit  or fuck up the good ip s they do get to work on. wait . maybe Im better off!
successful franchises have a persistent base of support and interest  which lends goodwill to new additions. they ll be accepted even if they re not very good - they just need to be competent.instead of capitalising on this  morgmazon has done the opposite. they ve created a base of resentment and apathy. now  rings of power s2 will not be accepted  even if its not very bad. great job.
showrunner  the person who has overall creative authority and management responsibility for a television program. the vision of the show as a whole does not come from the freelance or even the staff writer  but from the showrunner
I thought it was pretty funny that  in giving galadriel a sword  they symbolically masculinized her. I think their biggest error was turning an ancient powerful elf queen into yet another edition of conan barbie  symbolic manparts included .
there is no course correction that can fix what they ve already destroyed.  the disrespect and destruction of the lore has already been done.  you cant put sugar on a turd and call it a cookie.they need to scrap it 100  and start all over.
itseems most likely amazon s strategy will be something along the lines of  keep digging .
its fixable. but that would require courage. and talent. and humility.  all of these are missing from the  creative  team.
@spacecadet35  no  I dont think its fixable. you would have to get rid of the entire actor casts  bring in cate blanchett  hugo weaving and ian mckelle and redo the entire season 1 with an actual decent story telling and decent script. even then  amazon will never gain back the audience that it lost because they acted in bad faith  silencing the fans and attacking them. I remain largely skeptical that this is fixable.
@spacecadet35  fixable by a massive overhaul of cheap props and sets  huge lore breaks  unlikeable characters  etc... I think they need to either drop it or completely reboot it by never addressing the first season. I d say do a time jump but the idiots screwed themselves there by having isildur and elendil in season 1 as they have to be at the end of the second age
@ronin dave  - it is fixable  but yours would be the better solution.
the only way its fixable is by completely wiping out the existing production  firing every last decision maker down to props and costumes  and salt the earth behind them.  then hire a team that genuinely cares for tolkien and has no ulterior motive or desire to  update  the lore.  lastly  a deep  heartfelt apology to the fans for smearing them as racist sexist fascist for not liking their dumpster fire of a show.  its a moot point because exactly none of this will happen.
I agree with the dwarf stuff.  but I think it also exceeded the expected failure. on a personal level  I hated it. and I have a high tolerance for fanfiction. but just on a technical level. it is the worst produced show Ive ever seen. everything outside of some of the cgI and the orc makeup was completely amateur. there are entire segments of episodes that if they were removed the episode would be improved. its a failure up from the writing and story  through to the acting  and the direction cinematography. did no one spot these problems anywhere along the line
they just need to hire secular pro-human writers instead of postmodernist woke supremacists. if you staff the writing room with religious fanatics youre going to get a show filled with religious fanaticism.

vfx were fine
the only thing that they didn t botch was the fx. I guess they thought that fx and rubber ears would carry the show
just go rewatch the peter jackson movies. its pretty much timeless
just a piece of friendly advice boil your messages down to 2-3 concise sentences.  no one is going to read that wall of text  no matter how well intentioned.
@trick shaw  please keep your advice  no matter how friendly you think it might be  to yourself.
get tom shippey and pj in as showrunners
that is true  andthe power of the rings is fading with each passing episode  as we all hear treebeard s cry fused into the corporate machine theyocracy and their subordinates   a wizard should know better.  if you have lost heart or grown frustrated  join us for exsurge tolkien as we continue to defend the counter perspective to this heresy. it is overwhelming that the showrunner s rather than desiring to respect tolkien s tales  yearned to be the  Lord and God  of their own  private sub-creation.  now is the hour for all phans to realize that this show does not glitter and is not gold  and return to the valar  to the truth.  auta I l me!  and  aur  entuluva.
they just need good writers  writers that know the source material  and stay true to the source material.
they re much more than writers  those are the showrunners. they are essentially the equivalent of movie directors  making the big decisions thatshaping the direction the show will go  guiding the general writers  and writing the core elements themselves.
honestly mel  a lot of these creators  showrunners in hollywood are really crazy. they cant see that they create poop and then expect us to sit in the bathroom with them. house of the dragon  has a lot better effects and other aspects to it people like. if you were to compare both lotr   hod  hod is winning by a landslide. hod has its own problems but its damn good with characters. love the video
midnights edge is by far the best youtube channel to get insider info on these tv and movie properties
who would have guess that the 2 writers that did write multiple scripts based on their multiple ideas for movies and shows during last 10 years and were not able to sell a single one of their scripts to anyone would be bad writers for a 1 billion show.
I have a feeling season 2 s popularity will be heavily influenced by the friday night tights crew. I think most people who watched season 1 will only return for season 2 if the fnt crew endorses it as hard as they did house of the dragon.
amazon lead   we need more experienced show writers emplyee   let s get david benioff and d.b weis.
melonie is there any book or anime you would like to see as a live action  because I know a lot  or most  have been disappointing.
you know I would favor a good tolkien show over a got show anytime. I liked got very much  excluding at least the last season of course  but for me it wasn t fantasy enough. I love seeing monsters and non-human armies  like orcs  on screen. something middle-earth has to offer a lot but got not so much  okay  the undead armies were cool in got . I dunno whether they can really course correct rings of power  even if they hire other actors and writers to do so. I hope they will but I really dont know how they gonna pull that of. personally I think they would have to start over completly. and for that they have to restart the first season. this is the way!  -
they had signed on a contract for like 5 more seasons so I dont think there is any hope. unless they did an entire overhaul  possibly with an apology  get in legit tolkien scholars and followed their advice  get some real writers  etc  and even call season 1 a  dream   nightmare  scenario  I dont believe them.
who can fix rings of power for us    peter jackson    c mon  be serious.   dude. I am.
I cant believe they passed up conan for this...  george rr was so impressed with the conan write up he hired the show runner for house... amazon has failed on such a large scale that they turned down the guy thats currently wreckkkkkking them...  I hope hbo hires him to do his conan next.  amazon made very bad decisions on this one they thought a proper conan was too brutal and mysogonistic.   lol
unfortunately for them  they lack the ability or understanding of good storytelling which would allow them to fix this or anything else.
melonie you rock  girl! keep up the great work
its a damn shame that nobody tried to warn amazon of their impending disaster. if only... if only someone could have spoken up and said something.
now they need to do the same thing with rafe judkins for wheel of time
looking for more experienced show runners  probably should have started out with that lol
those first two episodes were beyond a chore to finish and I checked out after thatsecond one. reviews done by melonie here and others pretty much helped confirm the show sucked. although the parody videos  soap opera openings  salon selectives commercial etc  were much better
they should have thought about that one when they pissed all over tolkiens grave. Im not sure I ll even be giving the second season a chance  lol
they say later episodes of hotd got much better. many were about as enthusiastic about the first few like you are. so its one of those shows that gets better with time I guess. seems you got to give the whole thing a chance to have the full view of it.for rings of power  no  I could see from the first 5 mins or so its gonna shyte all over the lore in a rancid-kebab-diarrhea way. that has not changed throughout the season at all. you dont need to watch more than half of the first episode to gauge what a shytefest its gonna be.some shows apparently are not created equal itseems...ps  as stated myriad of times before  the race swapping isn t the cause  but a symptom. but an almost 100  certain symptom at that. once they do that to multiple character for no good reason and with no good explanation  you can pretty much diagnose from that alone.
if they amend their mistakes  I will give it another shot. I believe in fair treatment  when people recognize their errors  and work to correct them.
these people loved their own work so much that could not comprehend other people not loving it. this should be termed the rings of hubris
see this is a prime  no pun intended  example of what happens when a company gives a production studio unlimited funds with no over-site.
could we actually get a good series in season 2
yay! new video. I love these.
my mum is a big  fan of tolkien books  she hates it when people changed things in the movie  not just does she love rings of power  but she also says people who dont like it haven t read the silmarillion  where I seen people use the silmarillion to prove that rings of power does not work
you should persevere with hotd  its worth it. writing is very good  they show  they dont tell  the acting is great  some of the cinematography is beautiful  and the dragons are gorgeous.
bezos swore that no one who gave the show a negative review would get their package on time ..
lmao and I get an ad from amazon trying to push the rop on this video. hilarious.
one of my guilty pleasures is to watch channels where people react to movies and tv shows for the first time.  literally zero of these channels I follow even watched rings of power.
if they wanna keep jd and patrick around  and make some money off them  they could just hire a guy with a baseball bat to beat them senseless every time they make a suggestion  film it  and then play a montage of their beatings during the end credits. I d actually tune in for that.
unless they have an episode telling galadriel to get back in the kitchen and make some lembas bread  Im not sure they can even remotely fix what they ve fucked up.
the only way they would get me back as a fan is to release their true viewership numbers and let us rate and comment on all things in amazon  no more hiding reviews and numbers and lying to us.
I really wanted this show to be good  but is a disaster  I cant believe this can be fixed.
the only way of fixing rings of power I can imagine is a lazy  season 1 was just a bad dream galadriel had after coming in contact with one of saurons servants  seriously they broke the lore of tolkien  the lore they created themselves  leacy characters  their own characters  they even broke natural laws.the only way I can explain this is a bad dream cause in dreams nothing has to make sense. and nothing did
great take on rop. I dont see how this can be saved  the patient was doa.
what leaves me completely incredulous is how naive the business side of this project was to not have more oversight on the creative side in order to protect that investment. then again they probably just shut down any dissension or criticism and kept passing around the kool-aid.  as far as season 2 goes... it really cant get much worse. nowhere to go but up. I think morfydd clark is up to the task and I would give her the chance to redeem galadriel if she s given a proper script. and as far as the height difference goes  they already need to up their game with the dwarves and the harfoots and correctly use the technique of forced perspective which they ve not really done. but there s just so many areas that need attention   its hard to believe they can salvage enough to win back tolkien fans. we ll see what happens.
we have all had embarrassing moments moments in out life  but nothing will ever compare to shouting my girl gladril and bouncing up and down well clapping.
they should say thatseason 1 happened in an parallel middle earth  like a multiverse
as far as Im concerned  if amazon wants to turn reception around for s2  they re fighting a losing battle. the only way to actually fix this show is to wash their hands of rings of power and be done with it. delete rings of power off prime video ans pretend it never happened. ideally  they wouldn t try again after this. if amazon is really desperate to have a Lord of the rings show  then they need to make a new show that is actually made in good faith this time.
I honestly think they need to go back to the drawing board and completely re-do the entire first season. of course thats not going to happen  but it would have been the best choice for business. anything else at this point is just going to be throwing money down a black pit and hoping viewers somehow comes back in later seasons  when they ve already abandoned the show.
things can always get worse... theyre gonna turn sauron into breaking bad lol
I understand things have changed and not for the best.. but the last fantasy adaption I actually enjoyed with the legend of the seeker!. granted that was made before all this nonsense happened about creating things for a modern audience.. I love the show.. why cant we have those days back!
they made so many changes to the lore that many tolkien fans have checked out as it hardly resembles the original source material. the only way to fix this is to largely ignore the first season and just start moving closer to the original lore and timeline without directly addressing that they are doing so and bit by bit distance themselves from season 1 as much as possible. the other thing to do is hire better writers for plotlines and dialogue especially dialogue. essentially  they need to reboot the series.
too little too late  unfortunately.  the studio is apparently too self affirming to make good decisions about anything.  these decisions are made well before something goes into production
with this season they made sure there wasn t far to fall.... if season 2 ends up being as bad or worse that will be a true accomplishment for amazon.
there s no fixing it. no  retooling  will be sufficient.they can only scrap this embarrassment   try again.I hope they dont.also  Im sure there s some bean counters rifling through the receipts trying to explain where all that money went.
gladriel should be a stunner.  like liv tyler.  beyond human as far as beauty goes.  they even like used an effect on gladriel I think in the movies to make her glow a bit.
I honestly dont think the show is as bad as a 2 100  Imean really  it certainly has glaring problems-- but I d put it closer to a 40 100  simply because the set pieces and action  what little of it there was  I think was done pretty well. even still  to have this much money go into a show and have it turn out this poorly certainly requires changes at the showrunner and writer positions. happy to hear this could be the case.
love letter  to tolkein that was wrapped around a brick which crashed through tolkein s window and hit his head.
I think they should begin season 2 with a montages of the highlights of season 1  then transition to galadriel waking as if from a nightmare. then reboot the whole series from there.
amazon must be butthurt over cobra kaI killing it in the streaming numbers after what they spent on rop
why could they not just have hired peter jackson to direct rings of power
sometimes  when somethings so broken  its best to just recycle it and start again. theres no fixing what they did. they cant unwrite it now lol.
hey melonie mac  can we get a video from you about the  woke  redevelopment of the green lantern series  apparently they are changing the show from featuring alan scott and guy gardener to feature john stewart instead
the scriptwriters and directors actively hated the source material.
melonie...hello.  video idea.  youreading hard to pronounce last names.  I would legit watch an hour s worth.
since they re moving to the uk they can do a cross-over with doctor who and grand tour.
the only way to fix this is to do a she hulk ending breaking the 4th wall that was so inspiring. lol
its fixable  bin season 1 as a tax write off and reboot the second series entirely with a completely different crew.
I dont trust them. I will tune in when the 2nd season drops  but I have no faith in them doing it right this time.
I think the idiots who produced s1 actually wrote it backwards. they had the  genius  idea of shipping galadriel and sauron with the big betrayal reveal dream sequence thing and backfilled everything from there. I really think thats what they did. all the contrivances and plot points that went from point a to point b because   reasons   actually make more sense backwards working from the reveal to the sequence of events that get the characters there. the only problem is while that probably made writing s1 seem like it was going to make sense  when you actually watch it front to back  the motivations are all thin  the character development doesnt match what happens  nothing works carrying mood and feel through the story  its just all shit.
that was a mis-speak.  the rating is shown to be 2.5 10.  still horrible.
honestly even the action scenes weren t great. it had that problem of having a battle going on in the background with no actual background sounds. such that you d only hear the two people immediately fighting with no sense of a great battle happening. the sets also just generally fail to capture the size and scope of the world. they kind of tried with numenor to make it actually seem large and wondrous but they just didn t pull it off. it might be the lack of background extras to make their sets feel alive  or maybe just a lack of different camera angles to show beyond the immediate area  I dont know  but everything just feels small. the village just feels like its that one tavern a a couple of buildings.
I swear
rings of power has officially become my  puddingbrainviewer  litmus test!! if someone tells me they enjoyed this show I ll immediately know there is no point in having any type of intellectual conversation on cinematography or storytelling  those people literally just turn off their brain and absorb and impressed by any shiny cgI in their face. its not worth talking to these people  thx for the new official dummy test amazon!
wow. I love your desk with the lara croft figures. great collection!!!!!!!!!!!
an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. the people responsible for the show ignored that.
they sidelined the showrunners but not the person who hired the showrunners.
nice review kid  keep it up
re-tooling this show...its like trying to fix a yugo.  at the end you still get a yugo....
I think the only way for the show to be retooled is to have galadriel wake up in the first episode of the second season  clearly having just woken up from a horrific nightmare that was season 1.
do you know what show-runners for popular successful shows never have to do     they never have to tell their fans to like the show.but of course the show-runners for rop have been telling people why the show is good because it was failing hard from the start.
if galadriel in lor would have been a warrior queen then this series would have at least made 3  sense  but since she wasn t it makes no sense at all.
a wise man once said  you cant polish a turd.
I guess it is a good thing I am not a tolkien fan. I am kind of happy warner is starting to actually do something with the dceu properties finally outside of simple cash grabs.
Im absolutely fascinated by the fact that they put such an expensive and prestigious project into the hands of two complete noobs. how does that happen
maybe we see she hulk in season 2
Im so glad hotd is dunking on rotp right now  the audience has proved it
word is that antman and mandarin will be in season 2.
if tom cruise can use a box in his films to look tall I cant see why amazon cant pull out one of there boxes to stick all the actors on  a lot of them are meant to be about 7 foot tall.
it doesnt matter what we make  so long as we pretend its tolkien these idiots will lap it up big time.  pain and hackneyed  showrunners and salty  amazon idiot in charge.
did you ever wonder why a ship floats and a rock sinks   no   me either.
bastardation of tolkien is best definition of rings of power
I got an email from amazon stating that I should check out the  most talked about  series... yeah  its the most talked about  just not good talks
I vote for a redcon and a do over so the second season is actually the first one.
anything with chris gore is going to be gold. hes the man.
oh yay they re gonna try to fix this! I cant wait to not watch season 2 just like I didn t watch a second of season 1. my money and time are better spent elsewhere
it doesnt matter if they sideline the show runners  the damage is already done. its like  trying to fix a completely wrecked car by repainting it.
7 06  we dont support the view that our show is bad
looking forward to the showrunners  updated imdb entries Lord of the rings  rings of power season 2  writer - uncredited
time to bring in jj abrams since he s the one who originally got them this gig.
I fell in  to a burn-ing ring of pow-er!
I am pretty certain that big money beezos isn t that happy about them pissing away a billion dollars of his money. some people are just funny that way.
amazon didn t send their best for season 1. I assume some at amazon are good people...
I think the real question is  if in fact the presented  retooling  information is accurate  why would this be done at all when the series is such an amazing  outstanding  ratings tour de force  perfect piece of video entertainment with 25 million viewers  the most of all time evar
I canceled amazon. I haven t seen the show and never will. I hope everyone here stands strong and does the same. dont bite the hand that feeds you.
I knew it was dead the moment they were announced as show runners and saw their old twitter profiles. amazon got what they deserved. I didn t watch season 1  and I shall not be watching season 2.
I love you melany  you are so  simple and fresh  charismatic and beautifull for the outside and inside
I am not surprised amazon sells bed sheets given how many time these guys sha ...hit the bed.
its really annoying that corporations like amazon and disney know their product is trash  they know the audience knows its trash  but they still try to gaslight the audience through shill access media. they d keep more keep of their audience around if they just admit it was trash and they plan to improve it rather than have show runners crap all over the fans. sonic is a good example of this  fans hated how it was going to be from the trailers and they changed it up and people went back to watch the damned thing  no ill will was had.
damn  bounding into comics bringing down the hammer.
they act like this is a game its the real world we dont side line we fire for what they did to this amazing story
metcritic is weird. the review score from official sites is shown in    but the user score goes from 1 to 10.
their best hope is to drive a giant dump truck of money to peter jackson s house. even then  not sure even he could unf ck this
locking the door to a house that is burning down.they have now got much bigger problems than just a  bad show .their gaslighting and alienation of audiences has  I suspect burned through any good will  or expectations from viewers.
season 1 was the first impression  cuz we fans were already knowing that you couldn t but resist to inject all that woke stuff into tolkien s work.but even at that  if the writing was any good n did the woke stuff with intelligence n care  maybe  we wouldn t even mind
guyladriel - the bestest eva who could effortlessly shrug off a volcano to the face
you gotta give hotd more than 1 episode lol. I give all shows at least 3
I thought they figured this stuff already and they didn t care losing money as long as they get to push  the message . looks like I was wrong  they are just plain stupid.
maybe the new showrunners will actually read the source material lolalthough  too little too late. how can anyone salvage season 2 after what they already did
well  at least we can be sure they haven t started filming s2 yet since they dont even have showrunners nailed down yet.  ....or are they going ahead with filiming and will back-fill with further shoots and reshoots later   supposedly a big part of the billion dollars was to create assets capable of being used throughout five season. at this point only a genius beyond tolkien could have a hope of building something worthwhile on this crapfest. I cant imagine trying to fix this  especially hampered by the rights restrictions. but options 1.  hard reboot and replot from square one. unclear how to spin this.2.  soft reboot ignoring as much of s1 as humanly possible  ideally all of it . doesnt contradict s1  for any fans of that  but simply sets that plot aside and starts over fresh with some other better-planned story arc. treat s1 as a huge big-lipped alligator moment and let us never speak of this again.
as a advertising professional the worst thing you can do is attack your target audience and expect them to be supportive. not only did they not make what fans wanted  they outwardly mocked them  and tried to appeal to a miniscule   of the population who only care about social issues over quality writing. none of the characters were likable  their actions were inexplicable..and super slow.
...than they could have anticipated    !!!  how canthey have so much money and yet not comprehend that going on the offensive against the entire fanbase  meeting our concerns with name-calling  blaming us for their failure when from the beginning they ve made it clear they dont care about our opinions whatsoever  might come back on them in a bad way    did no one inside their massive company see this coming  maybe  just maybe  making an enemy of the people who wanted this to succeed might not have been the brightest idea !
there is no way for them to fix this show  they would have to fire the entire crew and start over.
I think they were counting on the movie fans not watching as much as they were getting new fans..  and forming a whole new base outside of the movie fans.that way they didn t have to follow the original lore.    but I dont see how they expected that.. Imean come on  this kind of genre is only liked by a particular type of viewer.
even by throwing all copies of rings of power into the fires of mount doom this show couldn t be saved.
impossible  no. improbable  yes.needs  new cast  some can stay   new showrunner  new writers. have elves all have long hair and glowing skin too. I think they could potentially keep the few leads for the elves... no one was especially bad there.
watched again now that Im not on my phone at work  lol. great video melonie. watching your struggle with some of the names is adorable . I always look forward to your videos.
tried their best     of course this show cant be fixed. makes about as much sense as trying to build a mansion on quick sand.
rings of power have been the best thing that could happen for youtube creators. maybe even better than she hulk
the moment a corporation says that they are  correcting the past  or its for  modern audiences  then you already know its loaded with ideology and patently awful.
this may sound a lot like a  scorched earth  attitude  but I believe the fans need to get their point across by not watching season 2.  amazon had yet another golden opportunity and they blew it.
do I think it ll get better  maybe. I want to say this show is definitely in the position of  nowhere to go but up ... but  I thought that about marvel after multiverse of madness... then she-hulk happened.
not sure they can even save it lol they d need to retcon the majority of series 1
youre missing out if your not watching the house of the dragon!! its amazing! I just had to look over the woke bs in the beginning but then it really gets good
they ve been trying to fix star wars ever since the sequel trilogy debacle and just keep digging a bigger hole. I think there comes a point when these producers just need to look in the mirror and say oops  maybe we should sit the next couple plays out.
isildur would have been the guy to cast it into the fire but even he has been killed off by the show  at least thats what they re implying
I agree about elrond and arondir. but every other elf was just so terrible. I dont know what their casting metric was  but it was very off. of course  the writing and costume design wasn t doing them any favors either.
@morimemento117  yeah. might have been one more I d be ok with  but rest deserve a  fuck you show
if amazon wants to fix this  they basically need to delete season 1 and start from scratch.
if you just watched one episode of house of the dragon it is way too soon to say you dont like it  even in game of thrones it took me 3 episodes to like it.
course correction for season 2  set a course for the nearest port  dock up  get off the ship  and never sail again. this was a mistake from jump and amazon is wasting money. they should pull a zaslav and cut it off here. quit while they re behind.
hey mel  love your content! you should react to the latest epic rap battle of history  lara croft vs indiana jones. I think you ll like it a lot!
well they would have to re cast and rewrite everything
another problem which brings some doubts... for hollywood and the likes  the sole solutions they have for a show not being  sleep inducing   is more action and explosions and effects and gore and sexual tension... they  dont even dare consider that the story itself  and how it develops  also plays a major role... Imean  if this wasn t true  then books would have never existed  and we d all be waiting for the next utterly cringe greek tragedy at some theater  molI re and shakespeare wouldn t have existed either .
I will say  the production quality was great in this show  scenery shot  cities and all that looked amazing. but they screwed the pooch big time when it comes to the actual script  they just changed way too much from the source material. I did enjoy the show for what it was but if im looking at pure lore adaptation  it was not good. they have taken too many liberties with it  I just dont get why writers feel the need to always butcher the source material to try to pass it as their own
they were told how to fix it by the fans but they chose to ignore them. too late  screw them.
the whole she s not that tall irl thing. do they think the guys who played the hobbits were thatshort irl
Imean   rop is getting a season 2 tho. lol the only people who are desperate are the youtubers that are still milking the hate for this series. dont worry y all are gonna be back next year for the 2nd season
any show who puts less effort into listening to the fandom of the source material than they do telling us why we are wrong for not liking the show  is doomed to failure.
Im ashamed to say I wonder what kind of dumpster fire amazon s fallout series will be. I live around one of the shooting locations and captured footage of the site back in the summer.
there is no way they can fix this mess  if they actually have to fix it it will start with the casting of some characters  koff koff black elf and hobbits. koff  and they will never do this first step.
rings of power  a billion dollar boondoggle. you love to see it!
season 2 opens with galadriel waking up and finding celeborn in the shower....
fix it in season two  how ! are they gonna completely change galadriel s character  remove gandalf since he is in the wrong time line  remove isildur since he is in the wrong time line  remove isildur s sister since she doesnt exist  turn sauron into an actual interesting character instead of budget aragorn  are they going to remove different ethnicities since they have absolute no place in the original work  are they gonna give elves dignity instead of turning them into a bunch of humans with horrible haircuts  are they going to retcon the forging of the 3 rings  no  then it will remain garbage.
amazon can deliver own produced shows that customers like to watch namely  the peripheral  the terminal  list  reacher  the boys.  rings of power shows will be difficult to get a money needed to have a 2nd series with a piss poor 1st series.
how is this going to be possible if they already shooting season 2
its a shame you dont like hotd because its an exception show. but to each its own.
and they think were dumb enough to beleive they can fix it xd
I haven t gotten a notification for rap battles in over a year. I thought he ran out of characters or something.
those guys will do just as much damage in the writers room as they will as showrunners. if amazon doesnt fire them completely  we should all continue to boycott the series  and amazon prime in general. you shouldn t attack the fans like that and keep your job  not even in a  reduced  role  and being in the writers room  responsible for the literal backbone of the series  the story script itself  is not much of a reduction at all!
one thing to keep in mind  amazon wanted these mediocrities as show runners because they would comply to the agenda. a more competent creator would not doubt resist the intersectional dictat.
sidelining the showrunners. -shocked face-
considering how they ve backed themselves into a corner with the first season  there is absolutely no saving the show unless they do a complete retcon and start from scratch with the actual book as a guideline for the central story and themes going forward.  otherwise  they d have another last jedI situation on their hands  where the story feels super disjointed.
girl ! youre smart af and pretty just georgius. just please dont put ever again those plastic nails. you have beautiful natural hands  finger - you dont need those fake plastic claws. you are beautiful as you are !
what s the accuracy rate of websites like bounding into comics
why wouldn t they have got peter jackson to do this series it could ve been incredible instead of a train wreck
remember  writers hate source material.
I really dont understand why you would write a 1 billion dollar check to someone when you weren t convinced they could pull it off and the wording of looking for more experienced show writers tells me that they knew ahead of time that these people weren t up to par.
rings of power is the genz star wars holiday special
I think amazon could reboot this. but they would have to get pro writers  understand and respect tolkien  and basically ignore thatseason 1 ever existed.I think they are fine with point 3  but they refuse points 1 and 2.
hm. if the showrunners are pushed back to stay in the writing room  how will that improve the story and the dialogue of the series
this just in  white star lines announces that it intends to  retool  the titanic after itsmashes into an iceberg and sinks to the bottom of the north atlantic ocean.
chris gore is the man! if you love film  you should be subscribed to the film threat channel.
if the reboot happened  I wonder what would all the defenders said  if the show is so good  10 10  nothing to improve but I cant see properly course correcting this without a reboot  since the foundation is.. what it is.. it can be better  for sure  but not what it could be if there was a proper reboot and care since the very beginning
anybody feels like guyladriel is like just a human  I bet people forget thatshe s supposed to be a royal elf. thats how bad it is.
Imean. someone needs to pay the price for this. its not just that they made a bad show. they desecrated the work of a dead man. they desecrated the work of a man who poured his heart and soul into it  and is no longer around to defend his work against this vile twisting of his original vision. personally I think itshould be illegal to rob someone s grave like that but ya know.
is retooling the same as remaking
its actors  writers  and directors so if they really wanted to make a different show they can do it. you just make something else with the same actors and dont get caught up in what season 1 dictated what season 2 is about. if someone says you made a different show you say yes  we did.
lmfao I got a rings of power ad on this video. Im so dead.
its like witchcraft
einherjar  is pronounced  ayn heh ree arr . bless valkyrie profile  lenneth for that nugget of wisdom.
I honestly dont get why people hate this show so much  I love the lotr movies and I thought it was cool tbh
I love the thumbnail by the way
the only acceptable option would be to fire everyone and get a completely new story.
this cant be fixed  they have already destroyed the story and its characters.
the only way they can fix season 2 is by pretending thatseason 1 doesnt exist and starting fresh. the show s biggest weakness is its writing  some of the actors are pretty decent and could still work  others Im no so sure about  but maybe they just had to put up with terrible writing and direction. but I dont think amazon is willing to go that far and admit publicly thatseason 1 was a failure even though everyone already knows it.
Im not be an uber fan of tolkein and total adherence to the source material isn t a make or break for me. so I rather enjoyed the amazon series  with a few small complaints but otherwise looking forward to a season 2. the only thing I would say is I certainly dont think they got their moneys worth out of whatever they spent the 465 million on. thatshould have covered 2 season tbh. but thatseems to be a common thread  rich people have no idea how and where to properly spend it  shrug   but a lot of people who worked on this show robbed them blind. anyway  like I said  I look forward to season 2.
Imean  unless they also sideline the writers nothing will change.
they d have to delete the existing episodes from the world and bring in real scholars with veto power over the script and re-do the first season from scratch to get me to care at this point. otherwise  they can expect viewer numbers that would be bad for a high school volleyball match for the next four seasons.
only watched the first episode of house of the dragon    everyone knows you have to make it past the first episode of a show before writing it off smh! the first episode was slightly boring but once you get to like episode 2-3 it picks up. unfortunate she missed out on a great show.
start season 2 with galadriel saw the whole season on a palantir for a possible future thatshe will vow will never happen.
the metascore is out of 100  the user score is out of 5.
I wouldn t want to be the guy s  gal s  that inherit the project of rerailing thatsh t
they need gladyourill to wake up in the shower and realise the whole first series was a terrible dream.
10 23did you seriously just cause payne and mcay  big writers and producers   xd
this all comes down to one decision. amazon knew just how much they were going to get from the tolkien estate  and they knew it wasn t much. it was obvious from the start that they would have to hire a writing staff and production crew that could take the brunt of the burden on their shoulders  filling in blanks instead of simply adapting tolkien s work. they knew this  and they could have simply walked away. but this is a lesson in hubris  not humility. their egos were too inflated  their ranks too full of yes-men  to allow such a decision to be made. but it would have been the right decision.
I just realised melonie doesnt watch house of the dragon  the best show of the year.
its possible  just reveal that this event happened in alternate universeand galadriel is the villain all along with catchy reveal song
we promise season 2 will be more cannon  expect it cant if everything in season 1 still happened.
they already removed original content  how are they going to fix this mess
the show looks cheap even with all the so called money investedsometimes I forget that galadriel is an elf. celebrimbor looks like an old man gradually loosing it n elron has a punch me facethe elves look so meh. people from different locations in middle earth look so generic n no explanation why there s so much mixtures of races at the different locations. just cast this pathetic show into the lava of mount doom
firing the writers would be a good first step but they have dug themselves a sizeable hole.  their best bet would be a complete overhaul and start over from the very beginning.
first few episodes of douse wasn t great but after the time jump it was pure amazing cinema! the fI sky rocked
amazon is sauron in this universe...
the damage is already done  no amount of course correction will fix that.
my daily dose of go boom
I dont see rings of power as canon nor should it be be treated such. in fact I really doubt any fan of tolkien see it as such because we ll  tolkien didn t write it nor do I think this how he would ve envisioned this.
the rings of power was doomed from the start.  tolkien s work is one of the two foundation stones of fantasy - the works of robert e. howard is the other other  and a superb trilogy had already been made of Lord of the rings.  amazon s way to handle this was to hire two callow young men of no achievement and let them jettison everything from both books and movies.  they made galadriel the main character  fair enough  but only in the forging of the rings does she play a major role in the second age.  everything I and so many others loved about cate blanchett s portrayal  which was faithful to the books  they erased and instead presented us with a strident  arrogant  clueless termagant.  the change is so complete  it cant be fixed.  I didn t watch the first season and I wont watch the second.
sideline rafe judkins too please.
just restart the series with a new season 1 and have it renamed. keeping the same name season 2 will be going in with serious baggage.
its painful living in a day and age where not only is itsome twisted goal to destroy things people love  but also watching entertainment go down this deep hole of ruining thier own success. who gave these people a show with the willing intent to watch it fail  where does the world turn for escape and entertainment when all entertainment wants to do is try to force the real world upon you its sad  and hopefully this weird miasma of unoriginality and hate will end soon.... just from a business standpoint you would think that they would want these things to be successful.its absolutely maddening and mind-boggling....
the actors and actresses probably did as good a job as they could with what they were given - which was garbage. we cant really gauge their true ability given the complete dumpster fire the writers and show-runners were handing them.how they fix this at this point is beyond me - they ve abandoned the lore to tell their  modern alternative  and you cant fix that. tolkien said the 3 eleven rings   narya  the ring of fire   nenya  the ring of adamant   and vilya  the ring of air   were the last rings of power made  celebrimbor and annatar  sauron  having made the previous 16 as  practice  prior to galadriel apparently kicking sauron out of the region. not sure how we are going to have the elves and sauron make those 16 now....given he s fled to mount doom.and thats the problem with  adaptations  that dont stay true to the lore. you cant fix things you ve already  retconned  to make them line up with the lore. you have to depart further and further from the lore  and piss off your potential fan-base. you d better be a genius story teller if youre going to do that  otherwise you wont pick up a new fan-base either.
they sank a ton of money into this train wreck  so they re desperately trying to salvage anything they can out of it. you know its bad when they managed to kill interest in Lord of the rings  the ip that basically kickstarted medieval fantasy as we now know it.
they need to work on the story for rings of power the visual effects are great but the story is not   the writing needs work     also the action sequences need work   needs to be longer   also the actors need to look better   meaning better detailed amor   weapons   costumes
greatest success ever!   I dont know what the trolls are talking about! this show is sublime! ended up in  showrunners shadow-fired  and  a failure beyond expectation . also read  never believe what access media tells you. never.
surely they are de-tooling
now that those showrunners got sidelined  will they then admit their venture was a failure
if they publicly fired them they would have scored brownie points from the real tolkien fans
rebooting it is the only option
season 2  someone is still avayable to invest money in this epic failure
they should ask peter jackson for advice...oh wait. lol
they dont want to force the real world on you  they want to force you to bow before their worldview.
everything is political  is perhaps the single most destructive phrase in the last century-and-a-half. and here we are playing games with it. eeeeesh.
salke fired the hotd show runner from conan citing toxic masculinity. this led to hotd taking rop s lunch money in the form of viewers. salke also had the worst actress in clark as her minIme or self insert. her not being fired over those things is why I dont care about this ip under amazon s ownership.
amazon wanted fans to believe in the Lord of the rings  galadriel is fighting her ex-boyfriend jilted lover   what a disaster.
they wanted to learn the hard way I dont even feel sorry for them getting all the negativity. quality is quality. they use excuses of race and gender and whatnot to try to justify why people dont like it. they didn t like it because it was terrible and written terribly.
the only way I can see for amazon to turn the whole thing around would be to 1  get showrunners  writers  etc. that are actually tolkien fans.2  bring back tom shippey as the tolkien expert and actually listen to him3  re-cast parts so that the actors actresses look the part.  some of those already in rop may survive  but in different roles.  nothing against many of the existing actors and actresses  but many of them do not look the part of the characters that they are playing.  morfydd clark is no galadriel but may look the part for an ancient human shieldmaiden  so sort of a 2nd age eowyn.  and I am sorry  but robert aramayo looks too old for a 2nd age elrond  he should look considerably younger than galadriel  not older.4  get someone who knows something about sword fighting to aid with the fight choreography.  several u-tubers who know something about sword fighting have really torn apart the fight scenes.5  take notice of what the tolkien fans have said6  write-off ring of power as a brand  then re-name the show and start again. given how bad rop was  they cannot fix it by carrying on into a season 2 as too much needs to be changed to fix it  better to start again.if they do all of this  then they might be able to turn things around.
spends tons of money on a show and cuts corners on writers and show runners. brilliant.
idk how they plan to save terrible series in season 2. if the setup is horrible  no one will even bother with season 2. even if season 2 is decent  you first need to get through season 1 to catch up with this lore non-accurate story. if they stuck to the lore  people could pick it up from season 2.
this is pretty positive  I dont mind the obvious social media influencer gaslighting and attacking fans if they listen to reason behind the scenes. ultimately I do want a nice show.
just a reminder that these ratings are skewed in amazon s favor
2 steps to fixing the showstep 1  watch house of the dragon   see what made it far more successful   talked aboutstep 2  fire everyone   start all over again. complete recast  new galadriel actress  new sauron actor  new elrond and so forth   new writers  directors  etcedit  step 3  get rid of the harfoots. its absolute snorefest   torture to watch them. they add no value to the storyline
amazon has become a sad joke.
this rumor  at the moment  is so vague and third fourth party that I think its misleading. if the showrunners  j.d.payne and patrick mckay  are to be believed  their going to double down on action   apparently two whole episodes covering a battle scene   plus make sauron a  walter white  type of reluctant bad guy. I think this is the  retooling  that might be rumored with them trying to make the show faster paced etc. so until I see some actual official announcements   or if gore give more details on what he heard  from his contacts    regarding sidelining the showrunners and such  Im not buying this rumor yet.
I honestly enjoyed the show  especially the visual effects  ignoring the source material... that being said  why is itso hard for hollywood to just follow the fucking source material  why! ! ! ! the show writes itself!!! I wish I could just scream that into someone s face. every beloved franchise has suffered from this.
amazon s showrunners love tolkein the way ivory traders love elephants.
they pkd it from the first episode. galadriel jumping into the ocean sealed its fate. mithril crack. female gardener as leader. harefoots. water going uphill. mystery box bs. there is no saving it.
I think this is too little too late they need to just cut their losses and accept they messed up at this point that is the only way to salvage it now.in my view it is impossible to salvage the show but they can still salvage their company if they stop working on the show altogether.pretty much everyone but amazon knew this was going to be a catastrophic failure.
when you define yourself solely as what skin colour you are  gender or who what you have sex with why would anyone expect these people to even grasp tolkien s work.
they shouldn t just  sideline these showrunners. they need to replace them and begin a new production from scratch.
to quote star trek picard  sheer fucking hubris!
more than a failure than could have been anticipated....except for the millions of fans of tolkien that anticipated it after seeing the very first teaser they put out....
melonie mac desperately in my dms
Im in love with your tats.
you think Lord of the rings would have ended sooner if hobbits had longer legs   its just an old joke
they should just start all over
let s bear in mind that wether they fix anything or not  they re contractually obligated to put out five seasons. the money is spent. the question becomes do we want anyone casually trying something like this again  im going with no. amazon has said if this fails they are done creating content and I think thats for the best. dont watch any of this show  the youtube videos on it are far better and in the process you learn actual lore from people who love the books. the folks behind rop have said publicly they think the books are wrong and have to be fixed. let the show and amazon fade away.
you need a dog called cheese so you can be melonie mac and cheese
there is no  re-tooling  a show which took the source material and used it for personal potty-training. they need to take the  1 billion hit and walk away  but they ve put themselves in a no-win situation with the shareholders. they deserve the metaphorical blood bath thats coming.
here s an idea... maybe get someone who s actually a tolkien fan to do it. like a real fan. oh and one who likes movies. with plots.
next season   Lord of the rings  the fellowship of the cringe
sure lets  fix  this vase that is blown up in utter dust with a few shards left...who has got the glue I agree  there is nothing to fix  it is dead. they killed it in one season! good job.
they should hire the guy from braking bad tbh.
it does not bother me that much that galadriel is short since the numeroans are 6 foot 4 in average up to 8  foot tall. the things is that they must also hire 4 foot 5 actors to play the role of humans which I doublt they did
every show has good and bad reviews  its not that the shows bad  its people that blow it out of proportion and read too much into it that make it bad all this arguing over a fantasy. I think people are generally spoiled by choice  puts high expectations onto the film industry and let s themselves down  you cant please everyone.besides the books and the films series aren t allways the same  both sides just need to stop with their barking and start snapping back to reality.
these amazon-people must ve lived their lives in an atombunker until 2022 !
its sad that many streamers and  entertainment  social media entities have figured out that there is money to be made catering to hate and ignorance. please  hate on me for not agreeing with your opinions  people. its your nature.
the show that was made must be unmade.
I felt the same way about house of dragon after watching the first episode it was so boring. but the rest of the season gets really good. I recommend watching it.
no one sees ebay opening up a studio and making shows. they are sticking to what they know best which is what amazon should have done. make a storefront online  and sell things and ship it to my house
they could have made a show through the perspective of the uruk-haI or the orcs but instead we got this dumpster fire
resert it. start from zero. it is easy and nobody will blame you  for that .
congratulations amazon  you ve officially joined a growing list of franchise killers.
I watch the reviews because the parody is entertaining and they give me actual lore. even discussion of tolkiens philosophy and beliefs is more intriguing than the show. its basically a template of writing Christian stories without Jesus and Bible pushing
5 56 - it is out of ten.  you even read that part out loud.  however  its not your fault  because for whatever stupid reason  metacritic does one score as x 100 and the other as y.z 10  causing exactly the sort of confusion youre experiencing.  simply removing the decimal point would make it  25 100 .  but hey  no one ever said critics were smart.
the casting that does not match the world of tolkien caused me some dissonance.  however if the writing and the pacing had been great I would have eventually loved the show despite things not being the same as the books.  instead what we got was this really janky  boring show with some nice scenery.
Imean...they couldn t possibly make it worse...right
house of the dragon absolutely crushed rings of power
the biggest flaw was the writing  the casting  the direction  the agenda  the props... each and every thing about this show was the worst thing.
amidst all the contradictory interviews from the  show runners   on their podcast  they literally ridiculed tolkien s anatar concept story line and had a little chuckle at his and our expense  laughing off his work and arrogantly patting themselves on the back for doing so much of a better job  with their ridiculous  vomit inducing halbrand  story . these clueless hacks are insidious.
let this be a lesson to any media-maker and especially investors who think that rebooting established properties is easy money. it would have been far easier  and cheaper  to just pick a new ip. there are plenty of living creators who would give up their fingers for a chance to stick them in amazon s pockets for a season or two. but amazon wanted an established fanbase without having to do the work to build one  or to pay for experienced show-runners that could earn one. congratulations amazon  you got everything you wanted and everything that comes with it. just think  only four more seasons left  d
melonie mac makes me go boom prematurely. daaaaaaammmmmnnnn girl  making me thirsty!!!! love your channel
of all the fantasy books out there who could compete with game of throne  they chose to use ... appendices from tolkien. tells you a lot about how many people still actually search  read  and appreciate books in hollywood. top of my head  the elric de menilbon  series  the annals of the black company .... just fuckin pick anything in any book store ... you know  what ... amazon does
quite the joke @fix rop.
I dont know how they cant sideline the current show runners.  the current show runners have run the show off a cliff  and it was a cliff they saw coming.  but they insisted on staying the course even knowing where it was going  so their careers went right over the cliff with the show.  the thing is  even if amazon genuinely wanted to redeem the show and give fans what they wanted  how canthey do that now   season 1 has completely demolished the lore and thrown out so many non-sensical story lines that no one gives a damn about that they cant all be tied up neatly to make sense.  not only that  the actual rings of power have already been made.  they ve been made and the scene where they made them was total dog shit.  the original show runners practically went out of their way to make itso the show couldn t be fixed.
they could reanimate tolkien s corpse and make him showrunner.... still wouldn t watch after season 1.
not possible to recover. they messed up the lore too much its impossible  its best if they just re do it and even re cast guyladriel  not saying thatshe is a bad actress but this role its clearly not for her  its who ever hired her faults.
I was pretty bored watching the first episode of game of thones as well. luckily I stuck with it and let them build up the characters and world. shame about the final season that came out for it though... as for amazon hopefully they learn to not hire people who hate the fucking franchise they re trying to adapt. itshould be like an established rule to only hire fans.
@melonie mac go boom   this is probably where they sourced it from and this guy is fairly reliable  https   www.youtube.com watch v azt0o1cnwgaits during the first couple of minutes.
all they have to do is go back to basics regerding the rings its not difficult the lore is not that difficult. there are 16 lesser rings forged by the elves and three elven rings forged in secret . and yes sauron gets the 16 so called lesser rings and gives 9 to men and 7 to the dwarf Lords. my God is it really that difficult
metacritic scores are so confusing. audience scores are out of 10 and critic scores are out of 100. either way  2.5 10 is still awful. lol
they just moved shoe runners to the writers room like thats gonna fix this crap how about firing all the writers and show runners
easy to fix rop  take the showrunner s the cast writer s and geoff bezos and drop them into mount doom.
she s a very short galadriel
...and also I love your content
if only amazon actually does sink  5 billion in this lol
I liked rings of power. it was fun to watch and I got to return to middle earth and see more of the elves and dwarf kingdoms. and here is why. I went in watching it and thinking to myself based on a family members talk of how every episode had a budget of 10 million dollars and it was very woke. I guess that comment was based on the female elf character. note that I dont follow social media. and I live a sheltered life from most of the cares of the world. I stick to friends and family based on all the noise out there today.I came across this video thinking she was going to be talking about maybe throwing in some stuff into season 2 to appeal to fans that have read the book. instead it all just sounded like pointless banter over whether or not the show ruined the childhood of fans.  not my own words. just what I found on the internet.  basically why people dont like the show and tabloid articles demeaning the show so people can sleep at night after finding out they weren  t the only people to hate on something.the reason I enjoyed the show is I went in knowing fully well any adaptation  radical or not of written work was just not going to be the same. the advertising made it pretty clear. so instead Imentally shut out everything everyone else ever told me about how to be a proper fan of a franchise and just enjoyed the show for what it is. not what was expected of fans for it to be. I have seen Lord the rings trilogy when it came to theaters when I was younger. I absolutely loved them. I never got the chance to sit down and read the books as our only copy was borrowed by a sibling and never returned. so naturally I poked around the internet a few years later learning about his earlier works. tolkien was quite remarkable. but to say someone else should have done his work justice is absurd. that is where the expectations comes in that I didn t have. in fact I completely ignored any idea that this show had some political or racial notes in it. I enjoyed it for what it is all by itself. when I realized that I can actually enjoy something without the world telling me how good or bad it was on social media I was extremely happy. and Im not talking about film or review critics. just average everyday people. reading through some of the comments on here I realize how insecure  unstable  people are about their entertainment. what happened to just enjoying it and not becoming the critic people love to hate
more of a failure than they could have anticipated . really  this is their official stance  fans have been saying this show was going to be a hot pile of steaming garbage from the get-go.  the only course correction that they can possibly do at this point is to set fire to the whole show and hire real tolkien experts and people who actually appreciate the ip to help them build a true second age story.
this  peter jackson guy  wouldnt be bad
the show is salvageable but amazon needs to stop the hemorrhaging. first  they need to very publicly fire the showrunners and their writing staff  producers  and the cast  heads on pikes  if you will  a non-verbal apology to the fans . second  amazon needs to bring on an experienced and talented showrunner  singular  that actually loves tolkien and isn t a j.j. abrams  the typhoid mary of ip destruction  disciple. third  they need to scrap the season one storyline and start fresh with new characters  recognizable actors and a new storyline. however  even with all these changes  it would be difficult to wash the stink of season one off of the show.melanie mac  Im liking the channel! keep killing it!
did they fire salke  no. did they fire the bobsy twins  no. will we watch or care about season 2  no
it wasn t race swaps  they added characters of color that were one dimensional characters. just making it a mindless action adventure wont make it any better.
its failure was entirely anticipated. it was no surprise whatsoever that it failed after they completely bastardized tolkien s work and hated on all the lotr fans. these amazon hacks are so full of themselves its disgusting.
amazon doesnt learn
they would literally have to fire all the actors  all the writers  all the costume designers  all the set creator s and all the showrunners to have even the slightest chance of saving this fucking dumpster fire
does anyone know if someone was able to turn dogpoo into a snicker bar  I know woke companies like turning good stuff into fecalmatter and demands we buy them.
payne and mccay are the ultimate fail upwards guys.
you cantell from the interviews that everyone involved at amazon productions hates the fans because the fans are racist and misogynist  hates tolkien for good vs. evil. Im pretty sure that they set out to destroy tolkien and turn it into breaking bad with elves and dwarves and  not hobbits . they bought fake good reviews  censored the true bad reviews  and heaped hate on all tolkien fans. this isn t a debacle  incompetence or a mistake   its the murder of everything tolkien. people are going to think this is tolkien
hey I understand that cris chibnall is available. just look what he did for bbc s dr who.  well maybe they should pass.
I dont blame anyone but amazon corporate for this mess. amazon saw the dollars hbo made from got and thought they could just stretch the appendices to lotr over five seasons to make lots and lots of money. they tried to scrape too little butter over too much bread. every aspect of the show  but especially the writing  is a lesson in what happens when you try to make mount doom out of bag end. when it became clear that what they had on their hands was a  predictable  pile of what comes out the north-pointing part of a mordor-bound shire pony  they did what they do best--marketing. all the virtue signaling was nothing but an extension of a cynical corporate greed  trying to pander to an audience  any audience  but particularly a young audience  that might provide them some roi. it failed. but if you think any reputable and competent team will want to take over this titanic blunder  you are falling for the same delusion as amazon. in the history of prequels thatshouldn t have been made  this one is now at the top of the list. amazon should cut its losses. there is no way to resurrect this stinker. it must  like its namesake  be cast into the fires of mount doom.
they ve already made the 3 rings though  so its a bit late. the 9 and the 7 were made before the 3  so already thats messed up. and how is the one ring going to control the 3  it used none of  annatar s  craft or anything  so they shouldn t be tied to the one no matter what.
at 4 05 melonie gets to a point thats pissed me off for years about hollywood.   they take an existing well loved ips which has the benefit of coming with a built in fanbase.  this means there s less work to get people interested in seeing the new content.  then hollywood ignores that this fanbase has expectations of what they want from that ip.  they change the core values of the ip into something else which pisses off that fanbase.examples such as star wars  marvel  Lord of the rings  star trek and coming soon will be the new indiana jones.  its also not just hollywood as we have been seeing the same thing in shows like doctor who from the uk.if you look at star wars the primary core audience has always been boys who want hero action adventure stories.  not saying girls or adults cant like it but primarily its always been a  boy  centered audience.   disney takes over and tries to force it into a girl centered audience     why   they removed a core element of what fans have always expected from the ip.disney spent over  4 billion on the star wars ip over 10 years ago.  that would be worth over  5 billion today due to inflation.   and the first thing they do is try to make star wars a woke girl centered feminist ip    stupid!
the writing was an absolute affront to tolkien lore and canon.  Im soo glad they cant get the rights to the silmarillion. I d go postal if they disgraced that part of lore.
retooling well there are a lot of tools they can get rid of
Im pretty sure this series will fail no matter what they change. the damage has already been done. to bad they are under contractual obligation to do 5 seasons  sucks for them.
basically from making a good show they are trying to salvage the show
do you preview these online reviews youread   I only ask because you seemed to not know the showrunners named  confusing them with actors  when you had just read that they were  indeed  a couple of the primary showrunners.  you then couldn t seem to figure out that the rating youread was actually 2.5 10  confusing it with 2.5 100.  hey  everyone has an off day.  not the end of the world.  you should do a piece on the online trashing  some deserved  some not  of recent content.  specifically disney    amazon prime and then covering some of the other content getting absolutely gutted online.
this abomination is beyond retooling.  they broke the lore so bad there isn t anything salvageable out of season 1.  their only option would be to ignore season 1  hire all new actors  costume designers  writers  showrunners  etc. and then start over with a new season 1.  nothing less will be satisfactory to most tolkien fans.
2 38 this is the problem with the movie series industry nowadays - fire them! they diminished the value of the franchise  attacked fans and made you lose money! fire them!
retrolling     are they going to pretend the first season was a dream and recast  rewrite   they probably can start fresh because the audience died on them. so you have a full set of fans who haven t seen this show and can start fresh.
the third reason doesnt make any sense. this is not network television  where you have limited time slots in the day and people have to choose to watch one show over another. fans can watch both shows.
the only way to fix it is to hire people that actually love tolkien and fire all these fake geeks off the project. and reboot it from the beginning.
the funny thing about these studios and review blocking  they act like if they just get rid of the negative stigma people will like the show. unfortunately thats not reality and I d argue that in general people watch movies and tv shows not because of reviews but rather general interest. once the public sees your show  the most stellar critic reviews aren t going to save your product. people are gonna see that its shit and leave. so amazon cantry and polish this turd all they want but at the end of the day its still shit.
give hotd a try again
youre doing yourself a disservice by only watching 1ep of house of the dragon...it actually is very good.
the best think they could do is cancel it completely and apologize to the world for that abomination.
best way to save it would be to fire them all ... stop streaming the season 1 ... format every hardrive with material from the season 1 ...remaking a season new 1 with new cast  new writers  and all other new crew ...call itsomething else ...
I totally get the hate this thing has been  rightly  receiving  but as a more casual fan of the books I didn t think it was  that  bad... just not great. if you watch it kind of more as a high-budget fanfiction of tolkien s world  its still not great but I d give it a solid 5 out of 10 as far as something to put on for an hour when you have nothing better to do. thatsaid  I do hope season 2 and onward can somehow stick closer to the books so I dont have to keep pretending its fanfiction.
this show was d.o.a. when they started slamming their own audience before the show even began. there s no coming back from that. no matter how hard they try  they ve already fucked themselves into the ground deeper than they could ever dig.they wanted a hit  but instead they got hit. rest in pepperonis.
too little too late. they alrdy lost the hard core and casual lotr fans with their woke agenda before the show even aired. I for one wouldn t ever give it a chance anymore after all I have heard about it and I suspect Im not alone.
despite the economic downturn  Im so happy. I have been earning   60 200 returns from my  7 000 investment every 13days.
retooling will not help this abysmal mockery. the only possibility is to erase the first season  fire everyone involved and start over with competent writers who both know and love tolkien  not incompetent liars who pretend to . also  they should not use anyone even remotely associated with bad reboot. listening to jar jar was their first mistake.
scrap the whole untolerable mess and redo the series.
dont fix what s already broken
how do you fix this by  retooling  it this is not a  retool  job...its complete gut job!  if they want to salvage this thing they need to completely dump season 1 and forget it ever happened and start over from scratch.  they made too many mistakes  too many destroying lore.  its not something that can be fixed by continuing the story... no matter what writers or showrunners you have.start over from scratch.  respect the lore  truly respect it this time and not just pay it lip service .  respect the fans.  and do not put anything woke into it!anything short of all that and it will not be salvaged.and of course  they will not be capable of doing any of that.  because to do something like that  to pretend season 1 never happened would be admitting their mistakes  and there are certain personality types  psychopaths  sociopaths  narcissists  that can never admit they were wrong.  why do you think so many shows and movie franchises just continue to go downhill no matter how bad they suck   because they can never admit they were wrong!
I cant get used to how some girls women look these days. it will probably be my age.
I rarely read the stuff ahead of time because I like to show my organic reaction instead of faking it. I upload what I like and some stuff I record I dont upload if its just a boring article lol
@melonie mac go boom  thanks for the reply!  Im sure you have plenty to do besides replying to some random guy.  think about my suggestion for a piece.  Im kind of amazed at the reactions of folks to some of the content.  for examples   disney   and marvel with their  she-hulk  attorney at law  series as well as the star wars offerings like  the mandalorian     boba fett  and then there s paramount   with  star trek  discovery  and  strange new worlds .  just like the obvious debacle of the amazon adaptation of  the rings of power   they are getting ruthlessly shredded by online reviewers.
this must be an investment with charles wilson.

after I got upto 300k trading with mr charles wilson.I bought a new house and Im now able to send my kids to a better school in the states thanks to mr charles wilson. when someone is straight forward with what he or she is doing people will always speak up for them.
the crypto market is highly profitable with an expert broker just like mr charles I got recommended to him and since then my financial life has been a success.
just withdrew my profits a week ago  it was so shocking when I withdrew  32 450 knowing I invested  3 000. I wish I could reinvest but  too much bills
@howard j.  thanks a lot I have contacted him now and he responded I see this as an opportunity to escape my financial situation
long term investment is the best now. I invested  6 500 in march last year with mr charles wilson and I top up my trade with  500 every week. now Im having over  147 000 on my dashboard. toping up your trade is really important
needs to be adjusted for a modern audience thats funny since people still binge watch the movies. to this day. nobody I know complains that there s no gay black dwarf girls. they usually say  shit these movies are long  or  bro that was awesome! wait its still going  oh Imean  thats cool  but I need to go get snacks. wait  this is only the first  there s two more   or  man  I feel like I need to clock out after watching all of those. are there anymore  no  aw
the way to fix it...start season 1 over with the story true to tolkien  and without the diversity   inclusion  equity   d.i.e.  woke leftist cult  virtues   no leftist politics at all  just a good live action tolkien based story. I dont think they understand the assignment
rings of power can be fixed..............................                    j jonah jameson laugh
morfydd clark is a bit too short and looks too innocent to play galadriel  who I think had her perfect actress in cate blanchett   but she isn t a bad actress. Ive seen her in saint maud and she s pretty competent  the thing is that even blanchett wouldn t be able to save such a poorly written  annoying  hateful character. its just impossible to express any emotion if they want you to portrait a  strong woman   meaning a mary sue  of course.I hope she does well after and during her time as galadriel  she seems like a pretty nice chick as far as I cantell from her interviews  like  she smiles a lot  for once  while in the show itseems she s got a stick up the arse .
let it go back into darkness from wence it came.
when the writing is just.... shit  a show is unsustainable. some of the dialog is just comical.
it needs to be cancelled. the entire existence of this show alone cant be fixed because the problem wasn t just the acting and terrible costumes and script  but also was the lore  the characters introduced and bastardization of the already existing characters lol. only way to fix it is to cancel this and make a new show that actually is faithful to the fans and j.r.r tolkien from the ground up. also how this is beyond fixable without canning this trash and starting over  is the actress who plays guyladriel her acting is awful but their not gonna recast her so its gonna fail again and again.
the guy who cuts off sauron s finger with ring on it dies in a building that collapsed from being on fire... how do you get back from thatttt
now they just need to replace rafe judkins in the wheel of time series. its sad that those books dont get the respect they deserve.
ford  sales have not met expectations  so we ll be re-tooling our premier marque  the edsel.
were gonna need 8 tons of pledge and mr sheen.  dont know how long it will take to polish this turd.
I really just like seeing jeff bezos lose money.  I hope he continues to dump cash into the show and Im praying for it to continue to fail miserably. then again the government may deem amazon prime  to big to fail   and start bailing them out
the only way to fix this is to scrap it and start over.
only way they ll get me to watch is if they brutally kill off galadriel  along with half of the harfoots.  I dont mean write her off  either.  I want it to be gory and final.  basically like got.
keep them out of the writer s room!
on metacritic the audience score is out of 10  the  professional  reviews are out of 100. so it is 2.5 out of 10  which is still horrendously bad.
they took tolkien s work and did whatever they wanted  do youreally think the show can be saved after everyone involved in the tv series wiped their collective asses with it  you cant turn shit into gold! my apologies for the outburst but I couldn t believe what they did with lotr.
still amazed how you take a Lord of the rings ip and commit 1 billion then hire unexperienced hacks to run it.
amazon got what was coming to them and Ive no pity. no matter what they do  the damage is done. to recap  if this had been an original fantasy series  I would ve given it more of a chance. but since it was a total desecration of a beloved and yes  seminal fantasy saga ruined with identity politics garbage that will forever date it  as opposed to pj s brilliant trilogy   call me what you will  you cant make me watch that. oh  and it wouldn t surprise me if pj s crew also used forced perspective shots and sets  such as the bag end set  to help dame kate appear taller than she is.
amazon will offer free electroconvulsive therapy machines to erase the rop season 1 from your brain. free shipping to prime members  clap.
I assume this is a scam . lol
bezos needs to find out where his billion    went because it certainly did not end up on screen. the story they have concocted has trapped this pile of garbage in senseless mediocracy. the only way to  retool  is to start over. the epic story is there if they would just pay attention to tolkien. the so-called plot twists and changes to the lore were amateurish at best and nonsensical at worst. apparently  the creators spent more money trying to silence real tolkien fans and trying to lie and manipulate ratings instead of creating a good show. and  to be honest  as a hard-core tolkien fan  this show did not have to be great  just good. payne and mckay spent a decade slogging out terrible scripts  none of which got made into a film  so I guess they went the sycophant rode with jj abrams and wormed their way into the most expensive tv series ever.
... their is no fixing rop. its fucked from the ground up. half their cast elements aren t even supposed to be in middle earth in the second age  they ve made the hobbits literally the worst things in the series bar none so far  the writing is just outright trash  the logic used by all the characters for decision making is questionable at best  and they ve made all the characters as unlikable as possible. in what way could this possibly be salvaged when they ve produced such terrible characters and settings that have undermined literally everything they can possibly build on
among other things  the writing was part of the problem  lol. leaving those two clowns near a script will deliver the same train wreck. but whatever. they ran this into the ground. couldn t care anymore for the life of me
I knew they would do a 2nd season no matter how bad the show did nintially. they arent fixing anything.....I promise they wont. they may add some lgbtq  whatever other letters there are into the next season.
rings of power snyder cut
on metacritic the review scores are out of 100  but the viewer scores are out of ten. I dont know why they do that  especially when they have decimal scores for viewers  which makes it effectively the same thing.anyway  I dont know how much they can actually retool rings of power to make it not suck  unless they start again and pretend the first season just didn t happen  which I strongly doubt they will.
the problem isn t amazon or even the  terrible  showrunners. its hollywood. every show tries to take beloved franchises and woke-fI them  rather than just focus on making them good   and then proceed to fail miserably every single time. maybe eventually they ll learn.
well I am patently evil.  so I guess they got me right.   but Im sure everyone else   the fans  are not.  well maybe a few.  but they keep it to themselves
amazon showrunners need checks and balances. you can see the change  or shift in their content  back in season 6 of the expanse. ended on a good note  but the writing seemed kinda week and rushed. the boys season 3 suffered from the same thing. week writing  and seemed kinda rushed and filled with things that were not relevant to the story of the show. the first travesty  was the wheel of time. after the first season of the show  Im refusing to watch the rest. with all of this  the poor writing of rings of power did not suprise me. house of the dragon starts slow  but picks up around episode 3  after the first major time skip. then picks up even more after episode 6. and in my opinion the end of season one rivals the ned stark beheading at the end of season one of the orginal run of got.  rings of power went into the dumpster the same way wheel of time did. they turned the show into the woke garbage you see before you. and yes  when I get home from work  Im going boom in the long dark  after some hell let loose!!! and go boom   yoursel mac!! love the content you post! see you in the next video!
want to fix it our man edgar allen poe has the only fix for this thing  wall it up and forget it ever existed.
you paid all that money for the ip  then handed it off to a bunch of idiots who probably never even glanced at one tolkiens book. I bet peter jackson is thinking  man  soo glad Im not apart of this shitshow. plus  I believe he is owed an apology for the hobbit
ok galadrahaters  you cant fix what isn t broken. rop is excellent  the cast gets you right over the forced wokeness  and galadriel is super bad-ass and super beautiful - although this melonie mac certainly gives her a run for the money in the looks department...but still  being a galadrahater is very unattractive. so stop it!...now if only time would speed up to season2...
people vote with their wallets. no matter who they are and or no matter what they are called.
the show runners and actors apparently want this show to be a diversity inclusion and equality. they were effective to that end. only they forget about a good story  proper editing  etc etc etc....!because itsucked it has gone off hopefully to die.as a black man I did not see myself represented on screen in such s poor way. a black elf who became a slave   the ineffective queen regent who eventually goes blind while the caucasian characters take a face load of lava and ash and nothing happens to them. the harfoots disgusting  take their wheels and leave them  to die   wow.this show not even made orcs sympathetic protagonists. yes the show will die because itsucks at everything!
ain t no fixing it.
galadriel should not be portrayed as all that  feminine . it would be more accurate to portray her as a wise and highly intelligent tomboy warrior. but no  she shouldn t be portrayed as a battlefield commander under normal conditions. she would command a personal body guard however.  her mother-name was nerwen   man-maiden    and she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the noldor  she was strong of body  mind  and will  a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the eldar in the days of their youth.   the unfinished tales  she was then of amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats   tolkien letters  348    even after the merciless assault upon the telerI and the rape of their ships  though she fought fiercely against f anor in defence of her mother s kin  she did not turn back   silmarillion  though grievous harm was done to the fair woods on the borders  the assaults were driven back  and when the shadow passed  celeborn came forth and led the host of l rien over anduin in many boats. they took dol guldur  and galadriel threw down its walls and laid bare its pits  and the forest was cleansed.   lotr  app. b  she looked upon the dwarves also with the eye of a commander  seeing in them the finest warriors to pit against the orcs.   the history of galadriel and celeborn  unfinished tales
shows like that for the past several years will keep on happening and we ll keep on complaining cuz of one major issue which is probably the only one that can actively be fixed by the viewers thesmselfs - its you the viewer.  youtubers not included cuz its used for content obv and yes Imean you the very same person that complains is one of those major problems cuz you watch it despite hating it. I dont understand people who openly hate a product and yet still consume it. I havent watched 90  of the new sw products cuz I knew beforehand they were crap   didnt watched the new thor for the same reason   never watched a single minute of rings of power  she hulk nope not a single episode. you can hate them all day long but if you watched it then you already lost cuz you gave them exactly what they wanted. is it that hard to avoid a show you know its bad   like you are not missing on something  once in a lifetime  . in the end I blame the  woke  writers and producers as much as the people who watched it .
this is what you get for selling your souls to what is basically the post office.
I actively refuse to even acknowledge this shows existence. it hasn t earned the acknowledgement. the moment I read that it d be adapted for modern audiences I knew it d be 100 trash.
even if they pretend season 1 was a fever dream of morgoth and season 2 is fully by the book. I am not watching.
rop was spectacularly bad.  I d watch if they abandoned any semblance of beig a tolkein story  and just have the orcs  elves  dwarves  and men join forces and hunt down the harfoots.
if they hire some show runners and writers that love tolkien more than woke ideology then maybe they can salvage something out of this heaping pile of garbage.  but thats an awful big maybe.  these wokesters are very stubborn and wont abandontheir zeal for converting us rubes easily so I remain skeptical of any dedication to improvement on this bezos boondoggle.
course correction not possible.  reboot is the only option.
hotd was absolutely stunning and really had one peak after another. rings of power looks so dull and boring that we shall not even watch it.
how canthey sell a season 2  of a show that failed in season 1 to no audience   there s talk of season 2 being up to two years out.  modern audience or not  retooling or not  this does not bode well.
I saw one episode and it was one and done.  horrible writing.  visually it was gorgeous  but it was all eye candy and zero feel good adventure and wonder storywise.  the people behind this show completely missed the point of the hobbit and Lord of the rings.  you are going from the point of view of an ordinary and common good person who is dragged into a wonder and danger filled heroic journey where they grow from their small village life experience into a coming of age where they are meeting wonderful people who stand by them and fight against adversity until they reach their chosen goal.  bilbo went with the dwarves to find the dragon s treasure.  frodo delivered the ring to mount doom.  simple straight forward goals with feel good adventure along the way.  the amazon series was... what   no sweet butterball main character like hobbit  and no wide eye d youth filled with optimism and sturdy good hearted intent  that is for sure.  we had a really badly retooled galadrial that I would not have given my trust or my admiration.  she was a b.  race had nothing to do with it  the characters were pretty much no one you d root for or follow.   no tolkien fan raed the books for emo revenge trips.  it was to be granted a delightful adventure with comrades that you grow to become trusted friends.  that tv show was just  it was zero fun.   really pretty to look at  and if someone wants to strip off the audio and do their own dialogue  maybe that would be fun.   I dont care what race anyone was  there was like one black main character  and zero asian characters  and Im asian  so its not like I have to have the leads be my race to be worth watching.   what I as a fantasy reader and watcher want  is feel good adventure  which again  amazon delivered zero.
they better not mess up the fallout franchise series...  shaking fist
melonie  you have to go back and watch the rest of house of dragons
she is so beautiful  holy quacamole batman !!
my dog pooped on the floor  I could spray the pile with something thatsmells pretty or throw it away.
the whole world is beyond sick of wokeness ruining every good story and franchise. this has to end.
the only way to save this is to burn it to the ground and start over. new characters  new actors  a new age. hell  make it a sequel to the original movie trilogy if the silmarillon is now too tainted for use. when you film the next season  stop the race-swapping and return it to its roots of being an anglo-saxon mythology  its ok if the cast doesnt look like they came from the bronx. stop making women the  bestest evah  warriors  where the men are all feeble idiots. woman should have an important role in this story but itshould not be to make the men look weak. listen to the tolkein scholars and make them part of your team. only listen to super-fans if they are actually fans  and not those sjw idiots who want to twist it to fit their sick ideology. and then pretend this season never happened.
andre s name name is  ein-hair-jar-n
the rings of power  averaged 30.5 times more demand than the average tv show in the u.s. during the first 30 days after its launch. this puts the series at the high end of what parrot analytics classifies as  outstanding   a level reached by just the top 2.7  of all u.s. shows.nearly 100 million people have watched the rings of power. amazon s the Lord of the rings prequel series  set to run for five seasons  is already breaking viewership records according to the streamer
it is just... the  most...      lmao
amazon just delete season 1 and start over.   you cant salvage galadriel    morfydd clark s galadriel is appalling on every level  unlikable  mean looking  bitchy to everyone   she really cant act  and the character has been destroyed by creating sauron.   everything to come up until the ring is destroyed is her fault.   this is not even remotely the galadriel of tolkien.  no character you have in this show   or actor is worth saving for a reboot.   fire every single person involved with this and start fresh.  apologize  admit you blew itand try again.    1. call peter jackson and pay him whatever he wants and give him the control he needs.  period.2. stop the woke bullshit.  stop attacking fans .  stop paying the woke leftist media to run cover for you.3.  stick to the books   tell tolkien s story and not yours.   you can never be as talented as the great professor.  honor him and his gift to the west with his mythos for europe  and honor his legacy.otherwise   season 2 will be the butt of jokes for years to come   like season 1 is.
I at least watched hod unlike this trash I knew to stay away from  hod  was primarily still trash too. but the last episode was finally intriguing. if the writing and show had been that good the whole series it would ve been more of a hit.
you can easily fix it by cancelling it.
can you please do a video about rings of power critics scores  how is it all the fans agree the show is terrible  even the industry insiders agree its terrible  but it has an 85  on rottentomatoes  and a 71 critic average on metacritic  what in the actual f  k  has everyone just calmly accepted that all the pro reviewers are shills  or what is going on  where is the fbI on this  thats an entire industry corrupt Imean aren t they supposed to be investigating fraud and collusion and stuff like that  isn t it against the law to pay off reviewers and to accept bribes  bribery isn t that a criminal offense
imagine marvel doing this with she-hulk. baaahh who am I kidding. of course they wont.
I am the wealthiest and most intelligent person  on this planet  according to me.never take for face value the testimony of an individual entity on the quality of its own machinations.
yeah  we get it... you have tattoos. you conveniently have them exposed in every video. maybe try something different.also  this is just me  but I d like to know how many others share my thinking... melanie claims to be a Christian  but as a single Christian guy  Im not at all interested in a woman who disrespects her natural body like this. itspeaks to a certain mindset or personal view that I am just not interested in creating a family with.yeah yeah  Im closed minded  whatever. its my preference  and Im entitled to it.my objections to tattoos are both philosophical and practical. as a Christian  I just cant see Jesus as a guy who would go you could ask to go get a tattoo with you. and on the practical end... most people can not decided on shoes they want to wear for more than a few months  choosing a tattoo that you d have for life seems ridiculous to me.Im just really interested in getting an idea for how many other single Christian guys share my opinion.
how about you arrogant tools just stick slavishly to the lore  how about stop shoving patronizing racist feminist ideological garbage down our throats   Imean  you have absolutely no idea what tolkien is about. I dont believe youre capable of honoring his work. why dont you just quit  and stop harassing us  or hire back tom schippy  and do nothing with your scripts and casting thar he does not approve. he s one of the few who can save you  an actual tolkien scholar who wont sell his soul for your filthy lucre. hire writers who actually love and understand tolkien. no more bullcrap. thats your only possible redemption.
so not respecting source material and insulting long time fans didn t work for them
I saw the first 30 minutes of the episode 1. fell asleep.  then I said f this bs.
a billion dollars and no one thought to hire talented staff or preview a few episodes. I bet amazon thinks rome can be built in a day.
I really want to know if jeff bezos s son is still talking to him  cause he openly said  my son is a big tolkien fan and he came to me and said  dont fuck this up dad  well you done fucked up bezos!
burn season one... and change everything and make a new proper season 1...if it goes properly we might see season 2
I think for metacritic user scores it is out of 10...still not good
more of a failure than they could have anticipated.were the scripts from those two not read before filming  2.5 out of a hundred
the only way I would watch rings of power again is if they redo season 1. still not interested in season 2 even if they fire the show runners because season 1 was trash
retool it... good luck with that amazon lol...
ah I love the absolute failure this has brought upon amazon. they. deserve. it. all.
I work in the  stow  section of a fulfilment center. I can only imagine the fakeness  hipocrisy  mindgames and fuckin incompentence in an amazon  big project .
they re desperate to make you think they re gonna fix rings of power.Im terrified how easy it is to please  the fans  with these hallow promises. they see hugh jackman stroll across the scene for a second  and they go insane. apparently  they have forgot the last 10 years of this shyt  and seem surprised when its just the same ol  garbage. just look at the current season  5  of  rick and morty ... or   more realistically   summer  beth  and lesbian beth .
there is no possible fix  trash it entirely and start a new one... this time properly...
one cancelation to end it all
there was plenty of people telling them it was going to tank  as it has nothing to do with the actual lore. or story line. how canthey keep saying they are surprised by this outcome    throw it in the garbage where it belongs and leave it there.
its too late... I have seen what I have seen.
careful dudes...she eats butter
if they have trash activists  or any activist writers  the property any property will be shit  period.
why dont you post this question as a hypothetical without directing it at any one person over on r Christianity or r trueChristian  how is this comment meant to improve your life  her life  or anyone else s who reads it  let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths  but only such as is good for building up  as fits the occasion  that it may give grace to those who hear.
post this in their trailers lol
what does it even mean to  retool  xdImean we do know who the tools are but c mon.
the only way to fix this crap is to take it off their streaming platform and reshoot it with the correct timeline and not introduce races that didnt exist till the third age  no race swapping and make sure that the characters get credit for what they did ie......gladriel should not be telling elrond thatshe seen horrors he hasnt....elrond was actually in that battle  not her. everything about this show is not about this fandom...only in name. galadriel also was never a warrior. there is nothing tolkien about this show.
yeeeeah  there is no fixing Lord of the rings  discovery.
2.5 100 is far too generous imo. I would have given it 1. at my best 1.5
I hear  chibnalls  available...
yeah  there is no salavaging this. they already made the first season  and continuing down this path will only make things worse. they should just scrap it and do another season 1 with a new cast  writers  and so forth  but following the actual books and lore. nothing woke.
they should have just never aired it and did what hbo did and use it as a tax write off
I enjoyed the series  I dont get all the btching
hopefully they dont go the disney route and lean into the wokeness harder.
dont ever give this show a chance. never.
it ll just get extra woke dont get your hopes up.
rings of power was fine. people over react. they went for the slow burn  but the execution could have been better.
complaining about galadriel s height got me attacked for  body shaming  on twitter. some people are completely without logic.
save it  they d have to redo everything. anyone they will hire will be just as incompetent  better to just write it off and try to sell the rights.
too late. this cannot be unf  ked.
I dunno can of gas box of matches I think I can fix it.
haha  they always say the same stuff inbetween series  but it always comes out the same again.
jeeebus this woman s gorgeous I have no idea what the video s about
I love your face
start overseason 1 round 2
an actor or actresses is only as good as the script allows  directors instructions sorry for bad eng
I agree that the show has a lot of problems  but that website isn t a good source for information  a lot of it is slanted and biased a certain way
how canthey fix it  that would be like digging turds out of a toilet bowl to try reconstitute them into the corn they once were.
their made bed now they have to sleep on it they only get one chance
go boom
so this modern day woke trash is the whole reason I have a problem with star wars marble and this right here including the fact that these companies continuously try to hijack video game shows  is the whole reason I dont like watching anything anymore. and maybe who knows hollywood is starting to feel the effects of it and I hope they are real soon  so they can just change there ways.
just a note from somebody who loves your stuff. maybe go for a softer light. your current light is a bit too harsh  and it washes your face into oblivion
its impossible that 1 billion usd went into this thing. I have several theories 1. money was stolen2. money was laundered3. 90  of that money was marketing costs
are those two shirts wrapped arround your forearms  looks kinda funny.-edit. sounds a bit offensive. Im just curious.
they just need to burn it and never lay their filthy paws on anything tolkien ever again. it cant be fixed.
I dont care  saw the show  liked the show  waiting for 2nd season. enjoy it for what it is or dont but all this drama is useless
its too late. the damage has been done. their only hope is to start all over and use the source material that they actually have access to. do that with professional writers and tolkien scholars  and tell the audience to forget about season one. pretend that it never happened.
they should just sack it off and try and from scratch  nothing they do in the second season can save it.
if it aint broken dont fix it.
they need to start from scratch and go by the lore not today s woke idiot ideas
boom!
well  they ve already cut the budget by 90 . if they dont fix it  they re burning money. if they re going to burn a billion dollars  send a few million my way.
getwokegobroke
the foundations are rotten. you cant build walls and a roof over what they did. you need to scrap the show and wait 5-10 years  then redo the whole thing  and hope you will still have an audience for lotr stuff by then.
dem rangzzz
99  of that money went right into the creators own pockets and we the evil fans got the result to watch suffer from.
am I wrong for liking the show. I know the show isnt cannon or rather a betrayal to the actual material. maybe I was hypnotized by the idea of something new to watch.
the damage is done  even if they course correct in a mayor way I doubt fans of the books or the movies will flock over for season 2  I know as a long time tolkien and peter jackson fan I will not  might as well just cancel the show  it was set up to be a disaster from the beginning so they should just let it die! my opinion
why did they even make this show in the first place   the movie trilogy was more than enough.  if I gave a crap what happened before those movies  I d watch the hobbit.
how do I get married to this girl
come on now you can fix anything with fire!  ..oh! you mean fix the show and keep it going !!  .yeah ..good luck with that
short of firing everyone involved and starting over completely  I will not be watching season 2 either.
2.5 is generous with that crap.
I just want bloodborne on pc
maybe they could go ahead and buy the rights to the actual stories.
amount of fail   woke x 2
but how can you build anything on bad foundation !  they already butchered the source material! its done.
they should scrap it and makes a new.
lara croft - https   youtu.be abkagjujofuweird I thought of you because I barely konw you lmfao  but I remembered youre down with lara  respect. enjoy
for you  it is one billion dollars you will never earn.  for bezos  it is chump change he found in his sofa.
yo mac whats rollin
of course one can fix anything if the tone is changed  recast galadriel  stay closer to the source material. I just wish they could fix the concept that these are beings that are thousands of years old.  which renders everyone on the show as useless.
what happened to the verse of the day
love you
so  they re gonna be keeping the two idiots on the most important place  the writting room.oh amazon  you summer child...
comes down to expectations. eg some things if they re free and you just want entertaining fluff you ll enjoy them. lots of people expect more of tolkien because he was so conscious of everything he wrote
the silmarillion is actually a really great book. that   thank goodness  they dont have the rights to.
haven t they already satarted shooting with those two still running it  utter mess.
I didn t like house of the dragon either. the protagonist mocked her own mother for being a mother in like the first 6 minutes. I was done after that.
lol. they want experianced  show runners that know the lore and are fans  fine . hire sir peter jackson like the were going to in the first place.he made the damn movies.
they need to get rid of the actress playing galadriel or have her persona changed
also youtube unsubscribed me from your channel!!!
you dont like hod   o daamn
nobody s going to watch season 2... they need to shelve it and do something else set in the lotr universe.
there is no fixing the mess wrought in season one. they either abandonthe project or start completely new. Im not interested in a continuation of the garbage set up in season one. never will be.
more like show walkers.
jar jar abrams and bad reboot rejects were chosen as show runners. everything they touch turns to
seriously  what is gaslighting
I love you. let s get married.
disney ruined the name of star wars so bad even when they make a passable good star wars show  it has low viewership.now imagine rings of wokeness s02 after the  success  of s01.
flabbergasted on how in the world do you spend a billion dollars on a show and you think its a good idea to go with all this woke crap with a billion dollars on the line ... they cannot possibly be that out of touch
lotr is about hope.rings of power isn t.
its so easy to fix this... step 1   burn season 1 and never acknowledge it was producedstep 2  beg tolken for forgiveness fir torturing his literary masterpiecestep 3  go read what tolken actually wrotestep 4   align the backstories with step 3step 5   quit preaching to the audience about diversity  gender  ethnicity and just make a good fucking story
I refused to watch it because of the hijacking of tolkien lore to woke culture.
girl  wtf. just one episode of house of the dragon n u r out  common! at least try melonie. the show is great! if u review this kind of things  how can u not be watching the most popular fantasy show right now   bdw  srry for my bad english
this is what I get for commenting on you youtube channel. hI this is melonie can I send you a telegram
what  your not watching hotd   get some therapy
reason they tried to make it progressive af im tired of this movies and tv series getting more and more progressive im going to stick to anime
too little too late
what s wrong with your hoody
if someone could re upload her videos with her voice pitched down a few decibels  I cannot stand this chicks voice but it wouldn t hurt to check out the material. I see this complaint every video so has anyone done it
scrap it and start over if the make a season 2 then it ll be connected to that non canon garbage heap so no matter how good it might be it wont be connected to the series and will lose most fans
its not a tolkien film. amazon doesnt own the rights.
its too late to  retool . it needs to be completely redone from scratch.
you can fix it lol cancel it.
the race-swaps are a massive problem.
the simple fact they got rid of the tolkien historian........well Im not too sure what they thought would happen its not tolkien. its like the rc cola if tolkien. its the president choice of tolkien. its the no name of tolkienyou can put diamonds and gold on a big pile of steaming crap. doesnt change the fact its still crap
Jesus and chill
too late
sad to see tolkien treated like this.
...marketing...
there is nothing they can do. they ve already established these shit characters  everybody hates  morfydd clark  what kind of name is that anyway  like who in their right mind would want to take over as show runner knowing this show is finished
the only way to fix it is to cancel it. get rid of it. burn it. they should ve never wasted all that money on it in the first place. thats their fault. play stupid games  win stupid prizes. they attacked the fans numerous times. why should we let them back in
get rid of all the people involved in the productions of rop  including the actors   and then completely redo season 1 and pretend the old season 1 doesnt exist.  stick to the lore.
Im hoping they just scrap the show altogether. it d certainly make the most financial sense.
8 10  I assumed that payne and mckay were affirmative action hires due to the poor writing.  whew  maybe they should hire some people of color to do the writing.  qualified writers  of course.
a lot of great shows had a bad first season... hope thats the case for trop
thatseries should ve been scraped in post production. cant believe people paid for those awful episodes.
I wish we could start disliking   liking adverts
what amazon did here was essentially hire two apprentice construction workers to design and build the largest skyscraper ever and then couldn t understand why the building then collapsed.. literally if this took place in any other industry heads would roll! like the absolute  sheer incompetence here is unbelievable! amazon should be sued for negligence and should be barred from ever touching another piece of tolkien property indefinitely. how in the hell can you have the most resources available of any show in history only to hire an amateur cast and crew! the minute the tolkien expert quit was the minute amazon should have restructured!wtf! !
wtf is she getting dressed
please do not continue with season 2. the only way to salvage rings of power is to  actually  fire the showrunners and redo season 1
why are people  adapting  fantasy universes to ours  they were comprehensibly created to be what they are by people far more talented and intelligent than they are and have nothing to do with our world at all.
anyone who falls for a  course correction  is a fool.this comment applies to anyone jumping on board house of dragon as well.
the only way to fix it will be to stop making more. nothing of value stands on poor foundations.
the damage is done. it cant be fixed. they d have better luck trying to perform cpr on a literal cow turd.
the writing and story was so bad  they need to totally replace the writers. if they wrote this crap  they are incapable of good storytelling.
excise the blue haired  nose ring having loons.especially the showrunners because all it took to hire them was a call from their former master and speaking a little elvish
. . . this was more of a failure than could have been anticipated  . . . given that there was no rule that they could not at least read the source material  like the silmarillion  etc.  that they didn t have the  rights  to  there is no excuse for how much they ve butchered all the lore. so there is no way in hell they  could not have anticipated  how crap this is.   thats even before all the bad acting  directing    dialog.
title credits ep2  15 producers and executive producers  incl weber  and mcpain. time for someones to put on their stunning and brave pants and demonstrate some accountability... thats still a thing for intersectional activists  right  accountability  seems to come up an awful lot when they talk about other people.
and the so called superfans never saw this shit  paid parody that was
I dont care  im happy they waste money and we can laugh at their garbage.
that happens for ppl with a little bit of self awareness n who quickly realize where they got it wrong n make necessary adjustmentsplease do youremotely see any of these traits with the ppl in charge of rop
the rings of power is a hit!
obI wan kenobI and rings of power has to be the worst shows I have seen this year and I haven t even seen shit hulk
like your top needs retooled....
boom
rings of poop
they need to just stop.no  second season . just... stop.
subbed the unsubbed when I heard she said she doesnt like hotd  your taste lacks subpar lol
I dont want to alarm you....but your  shirt has fallen off your shoulders and is only on your forearms.
you cant polish a turd
like the abomination known as  netflix s the witcher series   the so-called  sticking to the books  writers at amazon have no clue what they re doing  let alone when it comes to crafting a decent show  at the very least. there s no  fixing  the endless amount of mistakes they ve made. better they cancel the show  to be honest.
anyone wonder what would have happened to harry potter if done today ron would be a black lesbian and hermione would be the real chosen one.
I watched like 10 min of the pilot  was bored  and now they waited too long  so why bother   instead  I invested my time into house of the dragon  and I was not let down.  I have zero interest in watching any future lotr productions thanks to this drama.
bullshitwe all anticipated this failure
house of dragon was just softcore. if youre gonna watch smut just watch tick tock.
sam raimI sent kevin sorbo to new zealand with 200 bucks and made s better adventure show than this multI billion dollar company its to funny
haha  get woke  go broke
total fail
this is such a wasted effort. they have already lost the tolkien fans  why bother changing course now  there are still some that watch it  so either close it down or keep doing the same crap thatsome people still watch.
these people bought the rights for tolkiens books - just to change everyting in it  in the book galadriel has a family  but I guess the writers know better than tolkin... its obvious that their galadriel is a narcissist who dont care if some of their own die when she can reach her goals. she tells an ork thatshe wants to commit genocide by killing all of his species. she leaves all people that rescued her on a raft to die when a sea monster attacks. she lacks empathy and show arrogance when ever she can and the showwriters are suprised nobody can relate to her
there s actually a way to fix it. just erase the first season  post a public apology and do it again right this time
credit where credit is due. it took balls for jeff bozo to dump half a billion bucks on a piece of fan-fiction.
nearly 100 million people have watched the rings of power.
okie doke
done
cant.if they did that  it would invalidate the media parade they put sophia nomvete on leading up to the launch of season 1.  they can admonish absolutely nothing they have said or done publicly.  the best you can possibly hope for is quiet rewrites and the show runners being raked over the coals in the boardroom.
there is no performing emergency triage on this epic explosion diarrhea of a show. just kick the portapody into a ravine and bury it with enough reinforced concrete to make mount everest or olympus mons on mars envious. then forget it ever existed and hope no one tries to dig it up again.
nah  bigot is just a  synonym for  heretic  here.
definitely not. show is doa.
there is no fixing it. its a bad story full of unlikeable or just insanely uninteresting characters. the extras working in house of the dragon are more interesting than the stars of rings of power.
the actors are as bad as the storytelling too.
rings of powers was forged from hate and a desire to disrespect the original source as much as possible. there is no polishing a tur d . let it burn  everyone who worked on this is an accomplice of artistic vandalism...
even more boring than the movies  is that possible  amazon should greenlight a sevent season of the expanse  thats what I as a customer of amazon prime would want the most from them  if the rights go somewhere else  then I would probably move there...
there s no  retooling  this wreck  the car is totaled and unsalvageable and needs to be melted down.
you can polish a piece of shit  but at the end of the day its still a piece of shit.  lol.
yeah I could overlook the race swaps in house of the dragon.  house of the dragon injects a little too much feminism in it.  but its not show breaking.  cause you know women will say dumb women things.  but yeah I have absolutely 0 interesting in rings of power.
reada booka
I think house of the dragon was boring too. the writers of thatshow have no idea how medieval societies functioned either.
there is no fixing this p - I - e - c - e of garbageee. I watched it. is this a comedy
fucking up lotr is a mistake on par with operation barbarossa.
to me the actress is completely miscasted and  maybe she is talented  but she cannot show in this role. by the way babe  somethings strange about your  thumbs up  section. better check that out.
cant fix rings of power is 100  trash.  cant save any aspect.  kill it and let it go away.
the basic problem with this show has nothing to do with there being a black elf or whatever.  that doesnt even matter for the character anyway.  he s just another elf.  the problem with this show is that it is badly written and boring.  a normie audience doesnt care that much about departures from the lore but they do care that a show is boring.  this show is boring.
short haired elves piss me off to no end.
house of the dragon is the same scatological  incestuous tripe that game of thrones was.  no one should watch either.
rings of power was fine. people over react. they went for the slow burn  but the execution could have been better
same
they should start by replacing the galadriel actress. she is so smug and completely unlikeable!!!
go to the book  go to the book  go to the book .  those two guys are total posers.  they are not creative.
it failed in every metric except diversity which we all know makes great programming. I swear they could make a show about the rise of the third reich and race swap half the cast and these fucking seals would praise it for being current year.
this woman is a massive hypocrite  her whole shtick is making fun of people thatsay you are bad because you dont believe what I believe and does the same thing with Christianity.
it was just boring and some weird usa english.....u gotta at least have a grasp of the old language....inputting  north american ideology fai.s completely
