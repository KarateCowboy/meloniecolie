the reason they re turning galadriel into a  strong wahmen  is because feminists view women as being strong and independent only if they are given male roles  which is incredibly demeaning  condescending  and patronizing  if you ask me. galadrial came across as extremely intimidating and powerful in the original trilogy and she was completely unarmed and only wore a dress.
tolkien is for everyone     reflect what the world actually looks like  are the two quotes that make me believe this series will be awful.
apparently  amazon knows much more about tolkien s world than tolkien himself who created his world....   lol
the peter jackson trilogy was made from a place of love for tolkien.  the amazon show is made from a place of hatred and distain for tolkien.
the fact that we still dont actually know anything about this show  other than that its diversive speaks volumes to me
dude this channel seriously rocks already. you cantell how much youre enjoying it too
the dark elves or  moriquendI  of middle earth were   those numbered among the dark elves were all the elven-folk who never beheld the ennobling light of the trees of the valar. also I got the sense in every tolkien story that dwarf-women were very rare  so this single mother dwarf-princess would definitely not be single and or alone  and the only named dwarf-woman was d s  the sister of thorin and filI and kilI s mother. d s s husband died in battle  but thorin helped her raise her sons and became their father figure.also  many dwarf-women never took a husband  some desired none  or desired one who could not or would not marry them  in which case they would have no other.  also there are poc cultures in tolkien s world that they could have expanded on  the easterlings of rh n and the haradrim or southrons of harad.  harad literally meaning  south  in elvish  was also called the sunlands  sutherland and haradwaith.  I would have liked to know more about dissidents of these cultures who did not want to follow and aid sauron. sorry for the long comment - - I just dont like it when a franchise full of culture and lore is watered down like this.
they made the dark elf s black. I can go into a rant about this... they are called dark elf s because they are of the night. not their skin color.
I saw the dumpster fire that amazon generated with the wheel of time franchise and I knew that they were going to burn tolkiens work as well.
they re using the middle earth fan base but they re not actually delivering on any sort of accuracy  you nailed it. this is exactly what happened to wheel of time and it was heartbreaking. a big company who just wants  the name  but doesnt want to respect the story or the fan base  is exactly what both of these are. I will never trust amazon to do an adaptation ever again because its all about the     and nothing else for them. they dont love these franchises  and they re stepping on the heads of the true fans to make money  and are exploiting beloved stories to do it. its really disheartening and kind of an abuse of power.
I already knew this was going to be complete garbage when I heard that amazon recast and re-filmed what was already started after Christopher tolkien passed away.  aside from the predictable  woke messaging  that is bound to be there  I can see this show having the same problem as the wheel of time.  the forced diversity does not feel natural and actually confusing for viewers.  all the set pieces look the same and all the people look the same.  you have no concept of where things are taking place.  I also think that producers and directors today really need to at the success of arcane.  arcane has a very diverse cast  yet feels natural.  they have strong female characters  but not at the cost of their male counterparts.
that 5 second intro had me rolling.
youngrippa says the same thing. just stop supporting the garbage. tokenism doesnt belong in tolkien or any other medium. and the memes were savage. just   chiefs kiss
Im calling it now  we re going to get a badly written fanfiction by woke writers.they had articles and interviews ready to be posted just a few hours after the vanity article. that tells you they knew tolkien fans would go ballistic  and with good reason. calling the fans different types of -ists and -phobes just screams desperation. they cant handle the criticism  so they try hard to discredit them. they use the colours and genders of their cast as a weapon against the fans  its disgusting.the fans hate disrespect to the lore and the world they love. if you handle something as beloved and respected as tolkien s works  you should take the same approach as peter jackson  Im paraphrasing here  out of respect of tolkien we didn t want to put our own messages in the films. we wanted to tell his message.
my great grandmother survived 2 world wars  while living in the middle of it. she had several children  and they all died long before her. she was the matriarch of our family because she earned it. she hold the family together  saved the whole neighborhood because she talked soldiers out of attacking us troops in the middle of her town and my God  I recall her speaking and believe me  everyone followed her. there is power in woman and female representation without becoming fighters and  male  themselves. and no  galadriel never fought  as far as I know  she was a magician  a politician and influencer  if Imay allowed to use that term   and that bears more power in the end than any fighter could have. I dont know why all female heroes all! have to be manly to be powerful.
04 25. slight correction  they love your money  but they hate you as a person  and you can see that very clearly in how they treat and frame us . they always have  and they made no secret about their feelings  either. there s also the  artists  vs the  money people   making art vs making what s popular  issue going on  but I leave that issue to people within the industry to unpack extensively.
you know  I recently said to myself a few weeks ago   man  Im glad they haven t destroyed the Lord of the rings like star wars  game of thrones  etc. its the one bastion of good fantasy left. I didn t know this amazon show existed until a few days ago. I was immediately disheartened. Im sorry for jinxing it.
I think the blatant color-washing of so many characters in our modern age is more than enough ammunition for us to not have to pussy-foot around what these people are doing and not to have to forgiven even a single instance of it wherever we dont want to when it occurs. if they cant make a natural-feeling  convincing change that just legitimately seems like a fantastic casting choice thatshould absolutely supercede coloring  where it is not important  than to hell with them. tolkien wanted to make a dinstictly english mythology for his people in his part of the world with his ideas on faith... that means white  that means geography familiar to him as a brit and a dash of God and catholicism... Im not even remotely religious and Im only half caucasian and Im an american  but I can more than respect his world and appreciate it for what it is. Im also half native american but no part of me wishes for or has ever thought that his world needs native americans running around  in any way  shape or form  at any point in my life. if these racist weirdos cant help but look at anything and feel a need to black-wash or color-wash as much as they can  thatsounds like their problem and not something anyone else should even have to begin to excuse.
excellent vod  mel! my tweet that was shown at 2 29 shows that I believe it will be garbage. I got attacked for that tweet and still am. came home from work over 20 mins ago and noticed I got 18 notifications and I was like  this is where the fun begins  lol.
look at you with the intros now...
her evil powerful queen vision thing she showed frodo scared the hell out of me as a kid
amen.
she was several thousand yrs old with a ring of power at that point. she was more martial earlier.
there s a good reason the queen is the most powerful piece on the chess board!
.... yeah because galadriel wasn t extremely powerful and strong when she was almost a Goddess in rivendell. and looked good doing it.
you know this is a conservative show seeing thatshe isn t played by a trans!
bro she from a noldor and she was part of the r bellion with feanor.. how do u know she never fight
clearly bud u never read the silmarillion
its like they say  when you try to please everyone you end up pleasing no one.
Im from the middle east and we loved the Lord of the rings movies and went to see all three of them in the cinemas  this woke garbage about  tolkien for everyone  is pure tone-deaf crap they only say to virtue signal and shield their crap work from criticism.
reflects what the world actually looks like  then I need to find me a magic ring or two.
@ascendantstoic  I love how all races are united against this crap.
did you hear about the roots movie reboot  they are gonna recast all the slaves with japanese people.
@triniscout  this is not even remotely comparable to that.
escapism isn t allowed in hollywood
@ascendantstoic  I dont think any of us are gonna watch this show. we all know its gonna flop anyways.
galadriel was known as a warrior when she was younger and grew into a powerful magic user. so depending on how young she is supposed to be she could of worn armor. black dwarfs  of the 2 races of dwarfs neither was black. could there have been a 3rd race of dwarfs or elfs that was black it was never mentioned. depending on how far back they go could there of been black elfs and dwarfs maybe but then you have to ask where did they go what happened to them .
@dark highwayman  says who
@victor valandy bernard  elven women are never described as warriors in any of the books. even luthien was a sorceress who beguiled morgoth not a fighter.
I always find it funny how feminists complain about  toxic males  and  toxic masculinity  and then create female characters that behave the same way
@jezza one  at the end of the Lord of the rings galadriel was 8374 years old. she was a noldor elf. noldor elfs was the most war like elfs in the middle earth. she was the only noldor elf leader to stay in the middle earth after the 1st age. she also came to the middle earth because she wanted to rule over lands in the middle earth.
@kirby smith  elven women were never described as warriors in a single tolkien book. cope.
@bud389  so how many times have youread all 18 books
@bud389  galadriel and her brothers was blood thirty and power hungry in her 1st 3000 years.
@bud389  ok blood thirty might be a little strong but they did like battles.
completely unarmed  she was one of the bearers of the three rings originally given to the elves  and with that alone  is comparable in power to gandalf and saruman. she is a user of magic of superlative skill  the kind of skill that only comes with thousands of years of practise.yes   she would have spent at least a thousand years in her youth training in things like archery and swordplay  but she would probably have never been anywhere near the front lines  unless out of dire necessity.
@dark highwayman  lol she s already thousands of years old in this story too dude she was born in the 1st age and literally lived among the Gods of middle earth she s older than the sun itself  and there is nothing in tolkiens work describing her as  martial  or involved in battles.
@kirby smith  how to tell you have no idea about lore . without telling it
her power came from the knowledge that if she willed it  a thousand arrows would pierce the offender s skull in a second.
there could ve been black dwarves and elves in other places....as for the story the legit life there was no black elves or dwarves the darkest skin color would be light olive. dwarves lived underground so black dwarves make no sense.
Lord Imeant lore not life. lol
@martion manke there aren t any black elves and dwarves though tolkien described the dwarves and elves in full detail the darkest skin color for elves was a light olive. thats it.
@melodyofthesea78  I was making a joke as to why black elves and dwarves exist in the second age according to amazon but not the third age
@melodyofthesea78  further   dark  elves lived in the dark. melanin requires sunshine.
@kirby smith  well that is quite simple way of counting time if Im being honest. the years of the trees were 144 times longer than than the years of the sun. making her closer to 19 000 years at the end of the 3rd age when she sails to the west.
exactly! we have the 1960s bbc radio dramatisation of the triology on cd. and even though things are still missed out  they are able to go into more detail than the movies could.they too have galadriel warm  queenly and feminine. but none of that hides how powerful she is. when she unleashes it full force  its scary.  she d be a wonderful friend to have. but you d regret making an enemy of her.
this is nuts..so lara croft is not allowed to wear pants and a jacket in a rainy forest otherwise its feminists agenda   and women aren t allowed to fight with swords or armor cause it for male roles only ...I guess you guys must ve really hated vikings. lol
@mike carson  galadriel as described by tolkien and to an extend made famous by peter jacksons trilogy being depicted as an armor wielding warrior and a war leader being angry and brash is quite literally a feminists rewriting her character.you can make up all the fanciest of strawman arguments you want aint changing the fact that they totally rewrote her character.dont even get me started about the  single mother dating a black dude in a love triangle  I would also like to know how the people living in caves came up with a black person that doesnt have a beard.but thats just my racism and woman hatred coming throughasking questions is so 2021 just bow down before the messaging!
@jezza one  ...    youre basing women elf characters roles from a book that was written in the 1950 s   you know there were a lot of books written in the 1950 s that described women only being house wives. and now we all know that isn t true..right this is a common sense updated version of female elves in Lord of the rings that anyone should be glad about instead of oddly hating it this much..right
@mike carson  absolutely not. but galadriel isn t an ordinary mortal woman. she is one of middle earth s most powerful elves. in the books she is very feminine and gentle. yet at the same time she could blast any enemy out of existence if need be.in the movies we see her fighting the most evil of foes bare footed and in no more than her white dress. she doesnt need a sword  she doesnt need armour. and to dress her up like any old mortal warrior just demeans her power.
@theguy1991   oh yes. like gandalf she s giving a glimpse of how powerful she actually is. and how the ring would use that power to terrible effect.
@dark highwayman  yes. but why does a elf as high and powerful as she is need armour or a sword thats the point.  surely sending her into battle in just a dress sets her apart from mortal warriors. and even other elves  who aren t as potent as she is.
@bud389  yes. and you get the impression that once eowyn has experienced  the reality of going into battle  she isn t in any hurry to do it again.
@melodyofthesea78  there are races of people in middle earth with darker skin though  aren t there why cant they just tell us their stories  I d be up for that.
@sp3ak3asy  I didn t know that. but I can believe it.  send her into battle  all well and good. but this is an elf so powerful that why does she need a sword and armour  she s not mortal and she has more power than most elves.
@sp3ak3asy  yes. one of the norse worlds. the dark elves lived deep underground.
@redrosewitch  well..we haven t seen the series yet so maybe she will do all that barefoot magic fighting you dont know.   I just dont get people hating a series before it even comes out just cause a female elf has a sword. lots of male characters in books get re-vam for the modern age.  why does she have to be any different  I loved that female elf fighter in the hobbit and a lot of other people did.
@jezza one    viking women fought with swords and armor and vikings aren t western culture.  and as for lore... well elf lore  did changed. elves were very small in stature  and tolkien never said they had pale skin.  if you can accept those drastic changes to elf lore then you shouldn t get this freaked out by a female elf fighting with a sword right
@juuso vuolle  wow..a lot crazy to unpack here. o.k..rewriting a character is not changing a character s wardrobe and other then knowing thatshe  has a sword and wearing armor you have not watched the series yet so you dont know if they have re-wrote her character.  tolkien never described the skin color of dwarfs so I guess thatsolves  your issue about that..right  .   elves are as main stream as vampires every race has cosplay as.  but I ll let you answer your own statement.  if seeing a person of color playing a elf or a dwarf get s you so upset that you cant watch this series sorely because of that then you might not be joking about the racism.  I truly hope in 2022 thats not the case and over a fantasy series.  good day sir.
@mike carson  funny how she is the only black non bearded dwarf then aint it  which were described to be so like to men both in voice and in appereance that they were un recognizable by outsiders so nice strawman there and also for people living in caves them being african american is pretty funny to me.also the race of elves they decided to cast the cropped haired black inclusion character is cescribed as being the palest of all of the elven people and having long black hair. but thats not the the issue the issue as you so elegantly its the year 2022 and having race swapped characters and not praising it is racism. what a funny little man you are.also depicting a non introventionist ancient elven queen who spent her life with her husband living in peace and I quote  war against sauron without the intervention of the the valar is futile and depiciting a character like that as a war leader and wearing armor. is quite insulting to a tolkien fan.also they have come out and stated thatshe is  full of piss and vinegar and killed so many orcs she broke her sword.  she also gets into a fight with the numenorean guards and has to be calmed down by the new human character.then again Im trying to give someone logical arguments who talks who compares elves to vampires and thinks these changes are ok because its the year 2022.us tolkien fans did quite well without you wierdos for 70 years thank you very much.
@juuso vuolle  funny how   you dont know the first cave men in europe were african americans so blacks living in caves was a thing..but sorry excuse me  you were going on about not liking putting inclusion people thats different from the books in the movies  well..funny how  in the books all the human characters were base on german people  so unless all the characters that played in Lord of the rings movies were german  which they were not   then that would make you a gosh darn hypocrite now doesnt it and not a true a fan of tolkien!!! but I guess everyone  else that is also not german can play in the movie except blacks  say that out loud and then you might answer youre own statement if youre acting racist or not...lol.  and funny how   you say your fan of tolkien but forget tolkien base this book on this earth and guess what  on this earth black skin was the dominate skin tone on the whole planet for hundreds of thousands of years..so maybe acting this crazy over seeing some black dwarfs or elves shouldn t freak you out this much. and lastly   please name  one book that was made into a movie that all the characters were exactly the same as the books.. I ll wait.  spoiler    you are aren t going to find any.   so a female elf no matter how she is portrayed in the books  fighting orcs in action series really should not be this much of a deal breaker for anyone..cause that would be weird.
@mike carson  well first of all they weren t african americanthey were just you know africans considering that america wouldn t be formed for another good 200 000 years or so there is that.also tolkien made the story to be english mythology while it was inspired by old germanic poetry and works such as the nibelung ring and beowulf tolkien took inspiration from all over the world and did not base his characters on one specific culture.while black skin was dominant on our world it was not so in tolkiens writings  while there are people of color living in the lands below mordor the show most definetely isn t about them. its about the people who inhabit the northern and western lands of middle-earth.so adding black non bearded dwarf and crop haired black elf is just tokenism and really forced.you keep comparing our world and use it as excuse to change tolkien s writing.considering the trailer for the show has over 3 million down votes I would say that your post modern opinions aren t shared by the Lord of the rings fandom
@mike carson  well I couldn t really care less about american politics if I tried if Im being honest with you.also claiming that because tolkien took inspiration from different cultures that he based his dwarven and elven cultures on africa is pretty hilarious Imust admit.I can see that you dont do much reading in your spare time so I ll give a you a freebie they came from norse mythology.also Lord of the rings has sold over 150 million copies world wide so complaining its about trump supporters is just little bitsilly.
@sp3ak3asy  oh..so now you want to bring science into this   ok. tolkien base this on our real world and on our world everyone on this planet for thousands of years was only black. so to say they cant be black elves is silly right
its not supposed to look like the real world.  its fiction !!
tolkien is actually for everyone. but its not about everyone.
@triniscout   yes elves are also african folklore  you dont seem to know african culture very well   as a black man Im telling you to get your mind right and stop sounding as crazy as these people on here...black and asian kids dress up as elves for halloween and I hope to God that doesnt also offend these crazy people on here or we got bigger problem in this country then we thought..lol
tolkien is for everyone. everyone can enjoy it  but those two statements dont work together
well yes. and there s nothing wrong with saying that tolkein doesnt suit every taste.we had a tv poll here in the uk a few years back  to find the nation s favourite book. at the end it came down to the lotr trilogy versus philip pullman s  dark materials  trilogy.  lotr won in the end.but what many of the pullman contingent agreed upon was that  dark materials  isn t full of elves  dwarves and wizards. which enables them to take it more seriously.now a tolkein fan can counter that by saying that tokein is actually talking about our world and our lives.but I can see where the pullman contingent were coming from. high fantasy just doesnt appeal to everyone.
Imean diverse cast or not I dont really care one way or the other but I do find it objectively funny that tolkein fanboys are getting so worked up about it but not seeing the irony in mordor being a literal stand in for post wwI into wwiI germany yet saying the heroes should basically all be aryans lol.
@reaper39  nice try. wrong  but nice try.
@reaper39  actually what they are  getting worked up about  is that tolkien s dwarves have for generations  going way back to when they first appeared in middle-earth  which is way before when the show is set  spent 99.99  of their lives underground  where the sun doesnt reach them... which means that tolkien s dwarves have no natural melanin production  hence why everyone of them in the middle-earth lore is white.  the other thing they are pointing out is that every dwarven female in tolkien s lore has a beard.  also the reason the hobbits  even when taking into account that the show is set in the second age and that hobbits didn t appear until some time into the third age   men and most elves generally stuck to the north of middle-earth where its colder and there is less sun  the more generations of human s human like races stay in the more overcast and colder climates the less melanin their bodies produce which is why most races in tolkien s work are  white .  its nothing to do with wanting aryan heroes  its to do with following the lore.  also speaking of the lore the southern races in tolkien s work s  like the easterlings  are not white  but had been conquered swore fealty by to sauron  much like how the muslim countries in ww2 willingly sided with germany.  they had a chance to show these races in a more positive light by showing what the races were like pre-sauron  but nope  lets make the northern races more diverse for diversities sake.plus the whole racist fans are attacking the new lotr series articles were clearly written before the pictures were released  they came out way too quickly for them to be a reaction to what fans are saying.
its even worse than that. the current person in charge thinks he s a  composer  who has already written a  great music   when we all saw how much jackson busted his ass to make sure he created the best product he possibly could. Im seeing nothing but puff pieces for this show before its even been made.
yea  its not like tolkien created entire languages at all  what did he know.
@marinus van zyl   I saw the trailer and Im not interested in this show. I ll just stick with the books.
I know that this isn t the case but still  looks like db fans knows more about db than akira himself.
yeah its going to be shite
true but that didn t stop the purist from ripping him apart..now they love him..lol
trop is made from a place of hatred and disdain not just for tolkien  but for the fans of lotr as well.
the channel is on a great start.   thank you!  keep it up!
thats not even true but its obviously not because of their skin. they are called  dark  because they did not take the offer to move to valinor where the trees of light resided  thus they are  dark  as the others are  light .
you gotta remember  these are the same people that think orcs are black people.
I get representation and I dont have anything against it. but if I take thatseriously movies nowadays lack a representation of normal people.
@mike carson   what an overreaction. 1. people are mostly upset over the black dwarf  because a race that lives mostly underground would have low melanin.2. tolkien was very  very thorough in his worldbuilding. so its not just unfaithful and harder to add in  but honestly a bit disrespectful imo.3. his world was based on a historical britain. which was white. to think without your bias  imagine a show about an africantribe with a few white tribesmen added for diversities sake. jarring  4. the glaring issue about adding  diversity  is the trend of poor writing that follows. ex. see 1.
@donovan jarvis  there s also the issue that there are poc versions of the different groups of the middle earth universe  but the studio doesnt seem to be remotely interested in showing or expanding on them. the endless race and gender swaps are pointless  because itshows the studios wont take a chance on new characters and settings  and would rather focus on endlessly swapping out actors and actresses as the most superficial and laziest way of introducing diversity  while keeping everything else intact   while ignoring their commitment on writing other stories and characters  and this in one of the biggest playgrounds you can imagine. so that not only meant the studios ignored poc stories  settings and characters once  but twice now.
@marinus van zyl   well said.they re afraid to make new content. they d rather remake safe bets with their moral agenda attached.the worst part is how often the characters  setting and plot suffer for it. Im tired of it. many are.
@mike carson  you miss the point. if you want an example of what dark elf s look like download raid shadow legends and look at the dark elf clan. another would be the drow elf s of forgotten realms.
@shandI nicole beard  ..what skin color do you think elves that live on the equator on that planet have    answer  much darker skin. unless you think Lord of rings isn t on a planet    the other point is why are people that always claim to hate race pandering always seem to point out actors race...instead of them just being two actors who were hired cause they were the best actors for that part
@mike carson  well then  let s look at the elf s of elfquest then. the wolf riders were of the forest. smaller  light skinned. the sun tribe had dark brown skin. the mountain elf s were also light skinned similar to the dark elf s of lotr lore and the drow elf s of forgotten realms.
@shandI nicole beard  I get your point but my point is people shouldn t get freaked out seeing black elves.  maybe in that vast big magical world the sun is hotter in some places in which you get much darker people..and maybe some elves lived in those places. and thus we are seeing them in this movie.  great right
yeah. even if they aim for something analogous to d d s drow  itstill wont work. the drow do not resemble black humans. elves can no more be black in most fantasy settings  including tolkien s  than dwarves can be tall.
magic  sure. elves  bring it. wizards that are effectively angels  fine with us.but people with brown skin  now thats just too unrealistic for muh fantazy!
cant wait when they make a yugioh live action dark magician
@mike carson  I ll focus on elves  but you can apply most of this to dwarfs. they are dark elves because they never beheld the light of the two trees of valinor.making dark elves black because they are called  dark  is literal racismthey are taking the places of white actors  because dark elves are white races.black elves do not fit into middle earth s incredibly in depth history of elves.if they did  then no prob. but this is forced diversity that disrupts  again  very in depth world building. seriously  look it up. its insane. family trees folowing several races of elves across continents.you cant just add in new races into a tangled web of history! that would drastically change history!Im 100  down for  dark  elves. if I wasn t  I wouldn t own three light novel series with dark skinned elves.Im not a racist. Im tired of racism.
@mike carson  I grew up in the military  as is its how my father got his citizenship. thats right... first generation american here. growing up this way afforded me a perspective of the world allot dont see. do you know allot of other countries dont have a race check box on applications  nationality yes  race no. I was also born in hawaiI and pretty much raised in japan. talk about a wonderful country. I never even heard of racism till my late teens. at times I feel like an outsider in my own country these days. I dont recognize race I recognize nationality. Lord of the rings was never about race for me  it was about good and evil. I just want it to be true to the source material. now with thatsaid Im a huge fan of the elf s and I would like them to be portrayed by the book. if you want an example of what a dark elf should look like in my mind try raid shadow legends. the dark elf clan is a good example of how I visualize dark elf s.
@shandI nicole beard  hey shandI Im starting to get you and from you telling me how you grew up    I too was a military brat when I was young 3-6 years old.  what also happen in my late 20 s was me walking back from the store and almost getting shot by a cop driving up on me  with the car driving up on me going the wrong way.  the guy had half his body out the window with a gun pointed at me..Im only telling you this story cause it was a white woman cop thatsaved me. she literally grab him to stop this guy from shooting me.  it was a miracle cause I never heard this happening for anyone else  trust me I had ask around its just isn t a thing.   maybe one black elf in a land full of magic could be just a thing that happen. just saying  haha!!!
@mike carson   a freaking magic world stop generalizing. we are not talking about a blank slate  but specifically middle earth  which has thousands of years of lore. 21 races of elves. you cant just jam a new gear into a complex machine. it has to make sense. eru il vatar  the supreme deity of arda  personally created the elves and men. so no  there were no black ancestors. no one here said black elves cant exist in any story.they exist. people love them. google it. millions of fanarts. we re saying black elves have curiously never interacted with the entire history of middle earth. kind of hard to explain that away  this is not about race. its about woke agenda   storytelling. leading to plot holes  surface level characters  and inconsistent world building. Ive seen enough fires to know when to run. have fun supporting the woke. cant wait until they ruin your favorite property. my heroes are already dead.
@mike carson  p.s.   black elves haha!! tolkien specifically describes the only unions ever between elves and men. there are 3 of them and none of them were with a haradrim  a dark skinned race of humans .you greatly underestimate the lengths of tolkien s lore.
@donovan jarvis    asian people were in the Lord the ring movies and yet curiously  there was no  maga woke backlash or people pointing out their race. were asian people in that old 1948 book  ..nope. I watch all the Lord of rings movies and enjoyed it not cause of the race of people in it but it was just good action and acting. you aren t going to give this a watch cause someone  black is playing a elf..say that out loud and let me know how thatsounds.
@mike carson  first  nice try. those asians were hardly noticeable non-speaking roles  not trailer worthy characters...much bigger deal.second  I already said it.I avoid woke entertainment.although not simply due to a black actor playing an elf as you attempted to simplify to suit your narrative...I spelled out in incredible detail why.blackwashing  cough cough  literally goes against canon  cough cough.but sure. enjoy your  good action and acting  like cowboy bebop live action  ghostbusters 2016  charlies angels 2019  etc.and your mary sues like rey skywalker and captain marvel.I wont tell you you cant enjoy bad writing  just that it is indeed bad writing.have a nice day.
@donovan jarvis tolkien also said this world is base on earth past.  well white skin on earth comes from black skin but white people in 1948 didn t know that back then but now you do so itseems ridiculous now there wouldn t be black elves when white skin on earth come from black skin  and I hated female ghostbusters but I like rey in star wars..anakin skywalker can be powerful and smart but rey skywalker who is around the same age cant or she a mary sue   thats some real maga woke culture there buddy.    but you sir have a good day..watching what I dont know
@mike carson  wtf  I just told you God created white elves and humans. are you saying thats impossible in a magical world and double wtf  luke took 5 years to be able to call his lightsaber to him. trained under yoda for a month. and lost a hand.it took rey less than a week to use the force. rey mimicked kylo ren s mind probe without any training...lucasfilm s literally made up a power for her called  psychometry  when fans started to point out her power inconsistency. yes  mary sue.honestly  do some research before you post. I dont mind listening to your opinions  but facts are facts.
@mike carson  as for preference. I watch comedy and cute. like  dogs in space . I read fantasy because adaptations are often disappointments.
@donovan jarvis  ..every heard of a series called y the last man    it was a good series especially the first episode but the same people thatseem to hate everything they call woke protest against it and now its one and done...so hey I guess you guys are winning right   I would at least watch this amazon Lord of rings first episode before hating it out right would be my advice.
@mike carson  I generally dont watch western adaptations unless I hear unanimous praise. the witcher  for ex. other than the blackwashing of tris what does hollywood have against gingers    it was very good. never heard of  y the yes man . are yourecommending it rant-I definitely haven t won. my favorite marvel title   the new mutants   was butchered by hollywood. they put a socially awkward  devout religious  heterosexual girl  wolfsbane  into a lesbian scene. I gave 3 reasons that wouldn t happen just by describing her.the new mutants was full of dif races. it didn t need forced representation. vietnamesedominican scottish   americancheyenne indianrussian nova romana literal alien what s worse  one was a lesbian  karma  who they didn t add into the show!!this is why I hate wokeness. it destroys good characters for diversity s sake.it gives to minorities  not by creating for them  but by taking from majorities.
@donovan jarvis  yes Im telling you to watch y the last man!!! its got naked women  gun fights  the apocalypse and naked women!!! but I hope its not too woke for you cause it only got one guy in it      um..sunspot was black they literally had people  in the comics call him black and  in asgard they call him a moor.  but now we got issue...first I didn t even know the actress that played tris on the witcher was black until you pointed it out. was she not good playing the part   and the woman that played yennefer wasn t white either but if you say she shouldn t have played that part cause of that then this conservation is over..I re-watch witcher just for her nude scenes alone!!! she is hot af who care if she not white.. right
@mike carson  I looked it up  last man on earth premise. majority of women would be par for the course  not a woke sign. tbh  a bunch of naked chicks makes me worry in the opposite direction of woke. Im more interested in how they survive  community  politics  economy. not sex and violence.I ll give your show the 3ep rule and see. sunspot was dominican. his name is roberto da costa  for Jesus sake.as for witcher  character integrity matters to me.honestly  yennefer was cast fine. put a picture of yennefer from the game and show next to each other. very close in look. put triss game and show together  wtf  s1 they didn t even bother to give her red hair.how does pale skin with straight red hair turn into chestnut skin with wavy brown hair  another fu to gingers.
@donovan jarvis       hahaha!!! dominican is not a race..they even call sunspot black in the comics I thought you was a new mutants fan     how does yennefer  a pale white woman turn into a brown skin half indian white    tris is half black white..so you .o.k with the yennefer race switch but trish is a no go   . o.k I know we re starting to get along but damn..    can we both admit that the actress that played tris played it good at least
@mike carson  new mutantsyoure right  totally forgot sunspot was half black. with the italian spanish name roberto  from brazil  and honestly drawn to look hispanic imo  I recalled incorrectly. apologies. tbh  sunspot   magma were my least favorites anyway.witcherits not about race  its about accuracy. it doesnt need to be perfect  just their best attempt. yennefer looked similar enough  triss did not. not even the right hair color.yen s features give away her ethnicity more than her skin tone. she is very light for indian.there is a huge visual dif between pale to light olive  or pale to chestnut.acting ability and character design are equally important.fans notice character details  itshows appreciation for the source. triss isn t even character description accurate
@donovan jarvis  damn it... youtube just got rid of three pinterest link pics I just sent you on here   two pics of the actress that played yennefer   one next to a white guy looking brown skin and her next to tris in the witcher and them both having the same color skin and both with curls in their hair.   yeah..sometime she a light skin indian but most times she is brown skin and sometimes the actress that plays tris is pale skin and sometimes she is brown skin...the point is neither of them look white and yet..why is she more accepted and not called woke pandering then    its looking like its just with us the woke pandering police are coming after cause like you no one was calling out woke culture with her.. I can send the pics to you I just cant on here.  but maybe you forgot how the actress that played yennifer looked in season 2
@mike carson  I d say we simply differ in opinion there.I though yennefer was white at first. triss was immediately noticeable to me. reasons triss stood out over yen. maybe they saw what I saw.or maybe the lack of straight red hair was the bigger cue. or maybe they were already expecting itsince so many ginger characters have been blackwashed in the last few years.hairyen had straight hair with curling tips in both game and show. you could buy the same wig for both characters. triss went from straight red to brown perm. google straight red hair and you ll see what triss should look like. goolge brown perm and you ll see netflix triss. yen was a look a like  triss was unrecognizable.if you see it dif  I ll just agree to disagree.
@mike carson  watched 5ep of  y the last man  tonight. I personally haven t seen it to be woke. its more of a drama than I expected. a lot of interesting character plots. the show is very good at plot set up and juggling power struggles.the man is more of a plot device than a character  but thats a minor criticism. its obvious but doesnt ruin the engagement.
@mike carson  I went into  y the last man  blind. I thought it was an original show  but its based on a comic. Im not sure what they changed. if they added in agendas that were not present in the pre-existing material  then yeah  that would be woke. it was canceled due to the audience s steep drop from ep 1 to finale.not enough people liked it.this is a possibility you have to be ready for when changing a story.especially if those changes were on controversial topics. recreations have preset expectations and changes cause insinuations.  here s an example.an original story can make the villain of any race. in a recreation if you change a white villain into a black villain  now its racist.
@donovan jarvis  the actress that played yen is brown skin with big eyes and the video game version is a pale white woman with alluring small eyes..they literally look nothing a like. the actress anya chalotra would tell you herself she looks nothing like yennefer cause she is not white.   yeah..we going have to disagree on that but hopefully agree that one day the actress that played tris was right for that part..there aren t to many red heads that have straight hair anyway. where do you think the term  curly red head  comes from
@donovan jarvis  yeah y the last man was a comic and I guess I am surprise you didn t think it was woke or even enjoyed it a little bit. I  guess there is hope for you yet!!! hahaha!!! ..Im really curious where you live if people are saying changing a white villain  to being black is racist    I would never say that. I just be glad a black actor is getting work especially the way things are going now when I black guy cant even play a freaking elf lol...but hey I am glad you enjoyed  y the last man cause you will never get to see hot olivia thrilby naked in it again...     ...or the mass of other naked women that we would ve seen.   Im still going to blame the  anti-woke police side for that.
@mike carson  then we disagree. this though- aren t too many red heads  worst excuse ever.red haired actresses exist. red wigs exist. red hair dye exists.idk if y the last man took a woke turn. I didn t read the source material.an actor cannot play what does not exist. black elves contradict tons of lore. do you understand that  do you care  well  many people do.people will only watch what they like. its thatsimple.personally.since  everything s gonna be all white  aired  Im even more against race swapping. its just one more factor normalizing racism against whites.I ll be boycotting anything with race swaps from now on.
@donovan jarvis  o.k then keeping with elf lore then..in the 1800 s elf became another name for fairy..there is elf and fairy lore in african folklore. so I guess you can watch black elves in this series   everything is solved now and that was the only problem you had seeing a black elf right  ... um...we aren t having a serious conversation if you think there is racism against whites in hollywood when 99  of this cast is white...lol
@donovan jarvis  whoa..o.k I just google   everything going to be all white  it literally talking about people of color but the title does do a play on words and that offends you... why   .  there is a movie called  meet the blacks..and Im not offended.  dont congratulate me  the goal was to try to convince you seeing a black elf shouldn t be this big deal or the reason why you shouldn t watch a t.v series that also not be a big deal other then a fun watch over popcorn.. but it looks like I sadly and I do mean sadly I failed.  it is a big deal seeing a black guy playing a elf for you and I am truly sorry that it is.  peace.
@donovan jarvis  but we didn t mind seeing white people in the  black panther..yeah I honestly am kinda sad . maybe try to ask  black people what they are going through in this country now. if white people are some how the victims in this country  run from top to bottom by white people I would like to know what     in life I do try to put myself in other people shoes and I try to see things from other people side. you dont seem to do that and I think that might be the problem you have.   both of us talked to each other with respect and I never thought of you as being a joke but when I start to break down a argument  you have that you common sense might be wrong in then I am reduce to a troll joke   o.k..I guess we will have to leave it at that.  you win.
@stacey funk  I dont think having dark skinned elves is lore breaking at all.  I think the way amazon is going about it is all wrong though.  its entirely feasible  hell  even probable  thatsome of the elves from the first age would have fled south as refugees from morgoth s wars.  this is still an imperfect solution but it introduces dark skinned elves by stretching the lore rather than ignoring it and it allows for an entire civilization of dark skinned elves instead of just...the one.  seriously  wtf were they thinking
there s an actual wot fan film short that was a lot of fun to watch on this platform. I still have to work my way through the entire series  but as a standalone  it had everything a casual viewer could want.
@marinus van zyl   how do I find it
but are you going to hate a series cause of a black elf   I should tell my niece she cant cosplay as a Lord of the rings elf cause she isn t white    you talk about disrespect    all I saw was some guy playing a elf but if all you saw was black guy  playing a elf then thats a problem..@meloniemac should  not have may it a point to point out race for hating this series.    and lastly  out of respect  f tolkien we didn t want to put our own message in the film   thats great  cause tolkien never said what race elves were..so you putting your own racial issues into this is a disrespect to tolkien.   how about watch a series before just hating it out right before it even airs
@mike carson  I have given enough series and movies the benefit of the doubt for years now  so I have learned to stop doing that when trash shows and movies use the same approach when marketing their projects. this show has red flags all over its pr campaign  not just the trailers. most of what they talk about is race and gender  which means the foundation of the show isn t good storywriting - the foundation is contemporary ideals and values  which means  woke  in today s climate.  woke  writing has been proven time and time again to be shit and easily forgotten.tolkien described his characters  appearance to an extensive degree  he is famous for it. I am tired of this baseless arguement of   he never said what race they were . he didn t specify it by simply stating their race  he instead made it clear by describing their physical apperance  and explaining even more in replying to fan letters  questions. their  race  was elven  their appearance in regards to skin colour was akin to our world s north- and western europeans  which could be described as  fair   meaning white. but a few may also have a darker olive colour  as southern europeans  but not africans.the  darkest  colour of people in tolkien s works  second to the orcs  are likely to be the easterlings  but they were men  not elves. and neither were they described as being of black skin. the reason for this is terribly simple - tolkien made much of that world with england and its surroundings in mind  and the idea of making an anglo-saxon mythology. that means a lot of white and pale people.if you have read any of tolkien s books  I suggest youread them again and keep an eye out for how he describes characters and people. ... if all you saw was a black guy playing an elf...   trying to insinuate that racism has something to do with this  you are proving my point from the oc Imade   they use the colours and genders of their cast as a weapon against the fans .trying to paint me as some pathetic racist is nothing short of a disgusting attempt of discrediting my point without even tackling it to begin with. you have either paid zero attention the the massive amount of lore the world of tolkien has  or choose to overlook it all for the sake of cheap entertainment written with contemporary values and ideals at the forefront. this show will age like milk.my reason for hate of this show is simple  I hate that they make several unnecessary changes and infuse the show with their  woke  bs  when it has nothing to do with the original works. you are bringing up one guy playing an elf  I am thinking of a lot more than that - there are several characters they are misrepresenting so far  both men and women  and you can research that yourself. they are writing their own version of tolkien s middle-earth  and claim its  for the fans  - which is horse shit  they are making it for the sole reason of milking the brand of tolkien   lotr for all its worth.the people who grew up with tolkien s books want the stories tolkien wrote portrayed  not the works of modern idealists and activists. hating this show for the changes it does comes down to a matter of principle  namely respecting the source material youre working with. I dont care what ip you buy the rights to  if the source material doesnt support your ideas  you scrap your ideas and go back to the drawing board. the source material should always be the foundation you build on.I believe it was tolkien s publisher  rayner unwin  who made this brilliant statement once   you dont edit tolkien. that is the final sin.  and amazon s writers aren t simply editing  they are completely re-writing characters and events.
@thatguy  o.k first tlolkien died in 1973 but you  re saying youread the fan letters that long ago about people asking about race of elves ...lol.  yeah..sorry I dont believe that.  tolkien made it a point that elves were very different then humans..and he never  said the elves look like eastern europeans cause that would go against his own book.   he  describe the  elves skin and faced as greater then humans.. so no caucasian should be playing elves cause elves weren t caucasian  they are not  even base on  humans.  your not going to find any fan letter describing elves as having  human skin tone. and lastly amazon didn t point out race . you pointed out race.  you seem like a normal sane person..does it make  this much sense for anyone to get this upset over a show having a black actor playing a magical being that is not even human   if you say yes then what  next  we cant dress up as elves for halloween unless we re white   that would be very silly and beyond disturbing if anyone thought that right   I hope racial politics having gotten this low in this america  that anyone would say that to someone...lol
@mike carson  Im not sure I cantake you serious anymore at this point. the lack of knowledge you show for the subject as well as the claims you make are absurd. Im questioning just how invested you were in  the Lord of the rings  before this show caught heat. I even doubt you ve read  the Lord of the rings   certainly not  the silmarillion   and you just proved you didn t even know about his letters. you are just spewing out the same type of nonsense we can find in recent articles  from publishers that are defending the show. except that youre even further out of your depth than they are. at least they try to reference his letters in their claims  even though they use them out of context.tolkien s letters are famous amongst a lot of tolkien fans  and also referenced a lot by Lord of the rings content creators on youtube. they are even published in books  and count over 300 letters. its not just replies to fans with questions  but many of them are.who said elves look like  eastern europeans   are you even reading what I am writing  I will repeat this once  elves of middle-earth are described as  fair skinned   which is a fancy way of saying white  but prettier than normal caucasians. you seem to have no clue what amazon and their pr team are writing in their articles  you had no idea these letters were published despite it being very well known  and you are reaching for straws in your claims about how tolkien describes elves - because its not accurate at all. Im done with this. I have already told you why I have a problem with this show  you can read the previous comment again  with focus on the last segment. if anyone is hung up on the race issue  its you - because you are so blinded by it that youre unable to pick up on what I am saying.
I love that galadriel was an influencer xd
@art notforthesakeofart  without twitter Imight say. imagine!
good job bro.
on the other hand  we ve got something new to look forward to - something thats naturally diverse and actually fun to check at  the orville  new horizons - https   www.youtube.com watch v xawjq0fetywonthe back end of that  raising dion s2 trailer is probably the closest thing to an actual superhero movie we have at the moment.
lets  be honest  lotr was the last man standing in the culture wars. they had to wait for Christopher to die before they came for it.
she is your prot g  and you brought me here jeremy

@melonie mac go boom  jeremy really did us all a favor introducing you to us!
keep up the good work team!
thanks for making me aware of this channel.greets from the netherlands
you are a good man and the world is a better place for it.
I completely agree with you about what you said about feminity. I dont understand where western society got this idea that femininity is weakness. because its not. I also dont understand where they got this idea that a woman cant be badass and sexy at the same time. its like if she is a badass then she has to look like a troll. what is up with that
galadrial  eowyn  and arwen were all amazing and strong characters with depth. the problem for the left is they were all feminine women and you cant have that. the female characters have to be strong  independent skull crushers and the men have to be meek and effeminate.
I came here from a recommendation by the quartering. I have been overly impressed with and have really enjoyed your work! thank you  for putting your voice out there  for being proud of yourself and standing tall. you have really helped to show me that I shouldn t be so black pilled. that inspiration is hard to come by. I look forward to more fo your content!!
thanks so much for your point of view  it really gives more of a voice to us smaller people who dont have much of a platform in regards to protecting tolkien s work. you have just earned yourself a new subscriber
like seriously..... why.... why.... was so excited for this  but seeing all these  just simply heartbroken for the path they re flipping off the beautiful world of tolkien.
youreally aren t pulling any punches on this new channel  huh   I love this content youre putting out.
this made me so sad to see. I watch these shows and movies to escape from modern day trials and tribulations.
you have to think about how it feels for us to be here right at the start of a new channel that we know is going to blow up. its pretty damn exciting
I d like to see melonie on more streams! I wasn t aware of her on gamestop  but I think she adds a cool voice to this space. also tattoos
this is just another example of people hijacking an existing fanbase to jam their own ideological fantasy down their throat. its insulting. they feel entitled to inject their personal politics into someone else s work. its so frustrating to watch happen because they never listen to the valid criticisms. if these people truly want to tell a story with their own politics or ideological spin then they need to go create their own thing. they dont deserve to hijack an established fanbase and do a bait and switch like this. the problem is that these people know their idea s wont survive on their own and they wont attract a wide fanbase. they dont want to put in the work to build their own franchise. so they try to take the shortcut and just exploit an existing fanbase and attempt to force them to accept their crappy ideas. and as soon as that fanbase pushes back and says  no this isn t what we like  then they act surprised they are receiving criticism. how about they stop trying to get a free ride on someone else s work.
I thoroughly enjoyed your take on this. I hope to hear your take someday on people voicing characters that aren t their race  the woke people pissed about the voice actors of apu from the simpsons  or cleaveland from family guy
tolkien is one of my heroes and inspirations for my passion in being an author. I get special heated with this subject.
please keep up the good work! I came here from the quartering but have come to appreciate your efforts to put out content that is fair and well made. thanks!
hey found your channel from the quartering shout out to him and I like your videos your doing a good job its always nice to see insiders from the industry coming out and standing up against the far left insanity being pushed everywhere at the moment.
social commentary channels like this are awesome. maybe you canturn this into something very profitable  you can even leave the gamer days behind lol
Ive learned quite a bit about middle earth from my hubby  because he s a massive tolkein nerd. and my jaw dropped like lead on seeing that pic of their version of lady g. my first thought was that far from  empowering  her  they re taking it away from her by putting her in armour and giving her a sword.she s not just an elf  she s one of the most powerful of elves. she can blast her enemies  if need be and protect herself. why would she need the same tools as mortals tolkein made her gently feminine  and super powerful  all at the same time. the two are not mutually exclusive.  putting her in armour like any mortal warrior suggests otherwise.
galaderial power was thatshe carried a powerful influence because of her elegance.  she exudes fear because of the subtle elegance and power and she inspired both fear and awe because of it.
if I recall correctly  galadriel was one of the elves to follow feanor from valinor  she would ve been in beleriand during the wars with morgoth  and after the war of wrath she stayed in middle earth. Im not sure if her motivation is mentioned. but in the return of the king appendices she s the one to destroy dol Godur though I thought that was more of a magic battle. so  Ive never pictured it that way before but I could buy galadriel getting into combat.
yep  it was induction. something was causing radio induction into the cable. usually moving the cable doesnt work  but it must have been something local. if you wanted to keep the mic where it was  my recommendation of mogamI cables still stands
really enjoyed everything you said.  especially the Bible verse.  my dad recorded the books on tape when I was a kid.  he read the hobbit to us.  such good memories.  anyway  when you were talking about strong feminine women I thought that you looked and sounded that way.  appreciate you.
you forget that they all showed some affection to the menfolk. galadriel had feelings for an old friend to the point of facing the worst evil in her world  eywon was willing to stand in front of her injured dying father and protect him with her life and arwen was willing to give up her immortality for her lover. I doubt we are ever going to see something like that going forward.
@marinus van zyl  wtf    I didn t mind seeing that female elf being a kick ass fighter in the hobbit but apparently you did   ..I guess she was suppose to die or find some magic way to sacrificed her own life so that dwarf guy could live      gotcha.
it really strange that hollywood is so willing to change an author s vision for their own purpose yet in the past for example stopped the colorization of old black and white films claiming it would destroy artist purity this is so much worse melonie keep up the good work the truth is a powerful force
in the series galadriel will be several thousand years younger and that an elf changes a lot in this time  maybe becomes calmer and wiser  is perfectly normal. the way galadriel was portrayed I find it terrific  but even better I find how her past self will be portrayed!
I loved that galadriel didn t need an armor to protect her self  in hobbit 3 . and the destroyed it.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.    jrr tolkien
love lotr  the books were epic and the movies were fanastic!!! sad to see the way there going with this prequel if you can call it that. Im just waiting for a legend of zelda movie to be created...that would be epic!!! love your new channel  get to see the real you!!
Im enjoying your content. I like watching new people grow and spread their message.
I love that you include a verse in each video. its refreshing to see a simple direct approach to faith instead of the usual  or whatever it is you believe in  apologetic disclaimer most give  even though I do enjoy other s videos and hey more power to them but they relinquish their  come at me bro  at the door.also that verse reminded me of a quote  in the spirit of aikido book thatsays if you flow as one with the universe  who can stand against you
I said it on twitter and I ll say it here  the fact that this seems like a  shallow game of thrones knockoff immediately turned me off from it. if I wanted to watch got I d watch got. it just doesnt look like a Lord of the rings product. it just comes off as a game of thrones knockoff with the lotr skin slapped on top.
excellent video  melanie. keep up the great work. really appreciated your take on things.
here is a quote from the executive producer of the series  lindsey weber   it only felt natural to us that an adaptation of tolkien s work would reflect what the world actually looks like. that word  adaptation  is important. they have no interest in staying true to the source material  they are making an  adaptation  for the modern age  their modern age. in my opinion they should have that word in the title  something like  Lord of the rings  adaptation
melonie  I just want to say I love the fact that you are adding Bible verses to your videos. Ive been a Christian since I was 5 years  Im 32 currently  and it is very encouraging to hear God s word on youtube. and I love how you are doing your content how you want to do it.Im reference to the rest of this video  my heart is broken over the amazon adaptation because I am a tolkien fan and a writer. I know the peter jackson movies 100  word for word  but they are almost perfect movies. more importantly  they respected tolkien and the source material. this is part of the reason why Im writing my own novels  and if movie studios want to adapt my novels into a movie or series  I will only agree if they are faithful to the source material. I dont want hollywood to dilute my creativity into something that it is not. for example  my first book is a love story between two people with mental disabilities and illnesses  but I never tried to pander to anyone. my goal was to write an entertaining story with some Christian beliefs sown into the story. I would refuse to sign the movie rights of anything I wrote if they want to change anything from my books. anyway  I just wanted to encourage you to continue to do what youre doing on youtube and social media. it is very encouraging! God bless you!
hey! another quality video and another entertaining topic  well done! keep up the Bible versus and keep trying new things to see what works. I hope your channel continues to grow!
so glad to have you become a part of the community that calls out thus abysmal horseshit  you fit like a glove!
these videos are just awesome and wholesome. keep it coming please!
there s nothing wrong with diverse casting   I feel like I shouldn t have to point that out  but this casting doesnt fit the world its in. also my biggest problem with dwarf chick is thatshe doesnt have a beard  again just disregarding the source material
wasn t galadiel a strong woman already  Imean according to the lore  galadriel was born in valinor in the years of the trees  before the first age. according to   the silmarillion   galadriel was an eager participant and leader in the rebellion of the  oldor and their flight from valinor due to her desire to one day rule over lands in middle-earth herself. seems to me thatshe is already very very strong indeed. how they think they can improve that is beyond me. also she was no warrior but more of a powerfull magic user  prone to wear  the purest of white closing  the armor doesnt work.
I would encourage you to read the books just because they are so amazing  and will also go to show you how much of then we re transfered to the movies.
my prediction for this show is that those that know nothing about the franchise will praise it endlessly  for its visuals  and those that do will rip it to shreds. thats pretty much the modern standard for book adaptations  regardless of everything else around it .
new subscriber here from the quartering. I appreciate that youre interested in improving audio. that goes a long way in improving overall quality. one thing I can say is that you should definitely get a pop filter and maybe turn on a low pass filter if youre still getting those peaks with the  p  sounds.
as a black man  who spend his childhood read all tolkien book incluront the silmarillion. I never ask to see myself as a black elf
only the first like 5 or 6 ish seasons of got though.
@knowbody  I was just referring to the initial leaks that the amazon series would feature nudity and sex. thats par the course for an hbo series but it just doesnt feel right for lotr. its like if somebody decided to do a dark and gritty  zack snyder  like remake of power rangers. some things just are not meant to go together.
this is in contrast to peter jackson who said that he didn t want to add his own politics and opinions to the story  but honor the work of tolkien as he intended.
yeah  cause tolkien didn t know what he was doing. the gall of these  people.
cant wait to read your books and work  hope you do well in your journey to create an entertaining story with some Christian beliefs sown in just like tolkien did with his work! good luck
if there was a practical reason why she s wearing armor  I can see it. if she directly participates in fights  I can understand the need for a sword  because using magic requires time to prepare a spell  as well as tiring the magic user to the point of being weak and with no other way of defending him herself. if you check out the hobbits fight between the invaders and the combined dwarf and elf army  you can see the elves are wearing armor. the other times we see them they wouldn t because they need to blend in with their surroundings  where agility and flexibility in movement are needed for survival.
but how can you possibly identify with a character if he her they them doesnt have the requisite melanin count
@not crazy  why does that even matter  Im asian myself and I know its 100  a european cultured story  I never ask to see myself or my skin represented. I dont care about that  what I care about is these characters whom I can still identify with because of how extremely well they were written.
@lightforxes  because its disruptive to immersion.  tolkein wrote his books to stitch together the anglo-saxon celtic mythologies that had been lost after the romanization of england.  he also described these races in his books.  elves are fair-skinned and alien in their grace  etc. etc.it would be like putting inserting a viking looking dude as the emperor in mu lan  or a bunch of male amazons competing in the all-female tribe of wonder woman.  its obvious racial tokenization that forces the audience to focus on the political motivations of the director instead of the story.
@not crazy  I know
you could tell the type of elf by the color of their hair. it was long and specific in color according to what they were. telerI had silver  noldor had black  and vanyar had blonde...to deviate from that muddies the concept of the various types of tolkien elves. there were no  dark  elves. they were ethereal  and had a natural magic that was grounded in nature. it is obvious that this series does not know tolkien s imagined world.
these woke modifications are certainly not evil  but as you said melonie very disrespectful to the tolkien legacy and to the fans of this marvelous story.
it bothers me a lot that they call us racist  when there are a million problems in the series  and itseems that it is only the color of the skin....  I love galadriel and I admire her.... she is respected by everyone and she does not need a weapon and armor to be feared  she is one of the wisest beings in the world  thanks to her frodo does not die  the gimblI scene with her  that is how I would be if I were next to her  with respect and with tears in my eyes eyes like gimblI was .....elrond............................................. I have nothing to say..there are already girls of great power in this world  they want to make love between the color elf and a human  aragorn and arwen style  when you can show one of the best love stories of beren and lucien  where the supreme father comes to feel so to speak sorrow and empathy for their history that revives them so that they live a quiet life as mortals together...  there are a million things that are insulting and not respecting the work and the work of tolkien and his message... it is the world that I love the most and that they are doing this  they are taking away a part of me. greetings and peace.
I like the little aside about your bother - but I will interject to say that he may not necessarily have nothing in common with galadriel just because she s an immortal fantasy elf woman of incredible power and gravitas  d for me  growing up  I remember watching a lot of star trek  the next generation  buffy the vampire slayer or the x-files and I felt affinities with certain characters. I liked and felt a lot for characters like picard  data and seven-of-nine not for any skin-color reasons  half caucasian  half native  dont really look like either  but for their characters. I remember getting introduce to the chakotay character and not feeling too much for him - that felt a little bit like pandering - Imean  of course  the native american character had to be reaaaaaally spiritual  d typical. I felt more for janeway that was a no-nonsense  stalwart badass that could have gone toe-to-toe with someone like picard without shrinking away in fear.for me  it was never about skin color when I felt an affinity toward and an identification with a character - it was all about their character. who they were  how they were  what they did and why... not what color they were. how incredibly and pathetically shallow that is.long story short  elves aren t black neither are dwarves and even the female dwarves should have beards. I guess even those weirdo progressives on the show weren t progressive enough  apparently  d plenty of bearded white women that could have gotten a job and been lore-friendly.
it is worth reading the books  they re really good  especially if you have a good imagination
I  need to finish the books one day  only finished the hobbit  so I cant review this as a student of his work. I ll still be watching the series under the eyes of both a unique self contained work and what I know of tolkien. I try to do that for all adaptations. death note was interesting since I love the anime  haven t read the manga   watch the original live adaptations from japan  tbe netflix adaptation  and the stage musical. each adaptation was.... interesting  especially looking at the musical  but it had some good music . my opinions on them  especially netflix s  are controversial among friend groups because while I rate it  meh  as an adaptation  I give it a recommendation to watch as a self contained story.
Im puerto rican. where are all the puerto rican elves!  Im offended! honestly I wasn t expecting this show to be good even before any of this came out. now Im pretty close to certain that it will suck. you touched on some good points why.I just think the passion for the source material is not there for the people that create these types of shows. they know they ll get enough views solely based on name recognition and thats good enough for them.another good example of this is the sopranos movie  the many saints of newark  which I just saw this past week. the movie essentially had nothing to do with the sopranos but they knew by tying it to the sopranos  universe  it would get them the attention they needed and in the end thats all they cared about.
my mom read me the hobbit before I can even remember it. its so sad how they are destroying what he worked so hard on creating.
melonie I absolutely love your background its awesome.I was wondering how amazon was going to do there version of Lord of the rings
love your channel  happy jeremy bought it to my attention. keep up the great work.
you have to read the books  they are so good. one of my all time favorite book series  and I read a lot.
honestly melonie I definitely know quite a bit of the middle earth legendarium and  my girlfriend is actually far more knowledgeable about it than I am at times.I am using speech to text  so you might see spelling errors  but had to work quickly. like on the extended edition of the fellowship of the ring gimlI and legolas are talking on that boat and and they talk about lady galadriel giving gimlI 3 of her golden hairs and there s actually more to it than just that for example there was an elf Lord that always demanded more and more from galadriel and 3 hairs was the number he always asked for and she said no to that elf Lord because he was a jerk to put itsimply but gimlI was a very humble man in her eyes so she gave him the request thatshe denied the elf Lord when he only asked for one. even with that that is only just one of the multitude of stories they could have used that is in grand total with all those stories put together an absolute gold mine. from melkor s  fall to become morgoth essentially the middle earth ssatan   is the way to the war of wrath..
what about the fact that galadriel is one of the few people that was able to resist the lure of the one ring  which is a symbol for absolute power and the corrupting effects of it  thats pretty fucking strong if you ask me.
hey! your explanation of why pandering is so insulting was excellent!!
back in the early 70 s  we would all name our pipes for characters from Lord of the rings.
I literally seen that promo photo multiple times  and I had no idea that was supposed to be galadriel.
there are actually more dark haired elves in middle earth than blonde ones. galadriel was blonde because of her mother how was a vanyar  one of the three original tribes of the elves who had blonde hair . most of the elves in middle earth are telerI and noldorI who are dark haired.
they should ve just included the easterlings if they wanted more diversity. even though these stories happened thousands of miles away and they weren t in the stories originally. I dont think they will stay faithful to tolkien.
really loving your content  such a breath of fresh air. God bless you.
07 03. melonie  he was the manliest elf around... us guys  even the manliest guys had to be a kid at one point right  right  sees the picture.us guys  okay  you have a good point. also  we cant have bad-ass male elves anymore... it might scare some people.  p
some telerI had silver hair  some had blonde  most were  like the noldor  dark haired. some noldor were redheads.
@tar-elenion maranwe  yes. you are right. they did. nerdanel was noldor and had red hair. some telerI had darker hair also  whereas the  royals  had silver. I guess my point was not so much to segregate the clans to specific colors  but the point I was making is that you wouldn t take a character like nerdanel and give her blonde hair. it just seems to me that the portrayals of the characters did not portray them as tolkien had written them. it is a great discussion  and I thank you for your responses. I am not  all-knowing   and I am not beneath  being corrected on things.
@finarfin noldorin  no worries.
that elf Lord was feanor  the greatest  most powerful elf Lord in history  the dude that created the silmarils  the greatest artifacts in arda.and galadriel denied him even a single hair  yet gave three to gimlI  a lowly dwarf.feanor would have been p ssed  and every elf who knew about her gift was amazed  cause they knew she denied feanor.
@steve rogers  thanks man  I knew the legend of the three hairs she gave gimlI  but I am crap with names a lot of the time and I needed a refresher. once again thanks.
I like how everyone from around the world came together to roast lotr
peter jackson  made art.amazon  made product.
hey melanie  youre new to me. Ive heard your name spoken here and there but didn t know you until I got recommended by friday night tights and quartering.thatsaid  Im inspired by your what-you-see-is-what-you-get attitude so far. thanks for being another voice for us fans.
well I appreciate you very respectfully giving your opinion. I couldn t do that. but I agree with everything you said on the matter. good job. have you taken a look at the new halo series coming out  what s your take on that
so glad to see you active again  you seem to enjoy it a lot. good on you!
awesome channel and great content  saw your channel from jeremy and I love it! keep up the good work!!!!
they basically just turned tolkien into  game of rings
I had to rewind and watch that first 6 second again. bringing a tear to my eye its so beautiful
Im not even going to give this new amazon prime Lord of the rings series the time of day and this is coming from a huge fan of the peter jackson films as well as tolkien s work. lol
make the madness  stop melony! you go girl!
galadriel was such a badass  she never needed weapons or armor.
as destined to fail as we are to be blamed for its failure! smh
I really do hope this show fails. if a series that costs 1 billion dollars fails  there is little chance that they will touch tolkien ever again. also I hope that the netflix witcher will go after it and dies  so nobody will also touch sapkowsky s work. if they cannot adapt fantasy worlds  they should keep their hands off of them.
they cant create anything just like the devii. they just corrupt and destroy what s beautiful and good. God bless you my sister in Christ. keep up the great work.
hImelonie mac. loving your content  keep up the great work.
I was hoping that they did come up with some new great ideas.
you are definitely on the right track.  the only vote you have that matters these days is where you spend your money.
it really does look like they have messed up the vision tolkien had originally created
the first five seconds of the video already told me I was going to love this channel lol
love the intro!!! that was so hilarious!
howdy! a bit about myself  Im a boomer who caught an interest in tolkien s works in the early 70 s. I believe the first animated series of the lotr was done by hannah-barbera within the 70 s. it was a really good attempt to stay close to the lore that the books presented.   flash forward to the peter jackson movies. they were really close to the lore from the books  which were oh-so-much more accessible in this time period. Imust have read all of the series at least 8 times when this was released.  yeah  that much of a nerd  give it a try!  I think the series could have done at least another two films just to round everything out.   this new series  who needs a middle earth oprah winfrey  Im sorry  but all of this wokism in the name of equity will just dumb down everything  and make it look like another woke-clone movie.   you ve read my old man ramblings enough. I just want to encourage you to keep being who you are  and to never apologize for it. go with God!   p.s. nice ink! any chance of a background on them    see ya tomorrow!
galadriels design in armor makes me want to farm her for the irithyl straight sword and silver knight armor she s carrying
Im really excited for the episode in this series that explains why all the diverse people from this show are gone from the real Lord of the rings films.
what if we made the high king of numenor a dwarf   what  the high king of numenor should be a man  not a dwarf.  rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrracist!
I like listening to you and the content is great. keep it up
and what trash produces  trash will produce...and what garbage smells itsmells...in this case  most movies are both  frank capra I think this applies to the new  woke  Lord of the power
honestly I started to watch a video this morning about this I stopped halfway through when I realize that it made me want to burn all my books. they killed the last pure fandom.
there is no curse in elvish  entish  or the tongues of men for this treachery.   j.r.r. tolkien  the two towers
haven t read the silmarillion in a while  but Im pretty sure galadriel took part in physical combat back then in the wars against morgoth in the 1st age  so Im okay with her portrayal as a warrior princess  although Im not sure if she was doing the warrior stuff in the 2nd age versus sauron.
2 26 well  she had certain conflicts with morgoth but thats another story.
long time fan and really enjoy hearing your opinions
this channels being dope af keep up the great work loving the videos
oh on the note of the mic buzz. I worked in it and learned that cell phones can cause static on ethernet lines thatsounds like crackling something similar may be happening with the mic which is why moving it helped.
if youre not already tuned into just some guy  here on youtube as well   he definitely is a tolkien aficionado-the dude even speaks elven- you should review some of his tolkien vids defending the lore.  it will give you a better grounding  without having to read the books yourself .  cheers  and good luck growing your channel.
amazon is making an expensive show with uncredited actors.  that gives me the vibe that this is all about special effects.
you got my like at the intro.
found out about you from the quartering. love what Ive watched so far! looking forward to watching more!
itseems more like these studios just think the fan bases will stay no matter what. so they all ready have a fan base there.
yay  gym tonight! what s on the agenda  I usually get my arms done on fridays. but yeah  everything just seems so watered down in the film industry  its as if they re attempting to please everyone and as a result please no one. ...I guess I understand their intentions to make more money being inclusive  but if there s a fan base  why not embrace that. also! Im an advocate of continuity! I know sometimes it cant be helped  but when a character has changed actors  its such a buzz kill! ugh!
you know the irony of this being a prequel will mean natural selection in this universe killed off all their woke ideas injected into it.
the animation in 1978 was done by rankin-bass  not hannah-barbers.   the hobbit  as done by r-b was a great attempt to keep the spirit of the book even though they had to cut a lot to fit it in the 77 minutes allowed.  I wasn t really happy with the artwork but the story was fantastic  much better than peter jackson s rendition.  the voice acting was also perfect.  their attempt at  return of the king  was far less successful   I personally think it was a bad choice to try to do the finale of the trilogy that way.
please find and post the reference to her fighting.
@jezza one  tolkien in morgoth s ring   finrod and galadriel  whose husband was of the telerI  fought against feanor in defence of alqualonde.
@bart allen  you can fight by leading or would you say napoleon never fought a battle.
@jezza one  you asked about her  fighting  ... I love it when people change the goalposts  p how about when she  fought fiercely  in aman ...
@bart allen  I have already told you fighting can mean leading an army I am not moving any goal posts. one of its definitions is to struggle against something. point me to the reference where she scythed down her enemies with her mighty blade.also the history of middle earth is hardly canon it refers to gnomes and fairies in the some of the texts.
@jezza one   please find and post the reference to her fighting  -- I already did  and yes you are by attempting to re-define what you originally stated    nice try though haha I love it when people back-track
@bart allen  you must be totally thick. I have not back tracked I am telling you that fighting does not neccessarilly mean fighting with a weapon in a battle. my whole arguement is the quote  fighting  can be interpreted in many ways. I am  ot even disagreeing with the definition you have chosen it to mean. I am simply saying the arguement against the amazon version of the character is valid.
@jezza one  red-herrings and ad hominems - sooner than expected hehe  aw  baby  youre not a very sincere person are you  and Ive told you that Ive provided the reference you asked for -- from a text which isn t narrative based ...
doesnt that make him an elven linguist   fellow just some guy supporter here .  p
@marinus van zyl   indeed  more than i
its even worse when you still physically have the actor or actress   who is willing to do the role again... and for some reason they go nope... not gonna finish his or her story. like the king conan pitch  for example. gimme the end of his story  and I dont care how badly you bastardize the fictional universe later on. just give me a single good story  from beginning to end that actually finishes a character arc. at least you d have a single good story from that universe you can remember fondly.
hahahahaha! good one
loving your new channel  keep up the awesome work   God bless
can hear you much better now    thanks for making this channel.
I heard they were only going to do the last chapter of the last book because it has gandalf in it
0 28busted! I saw that!  just kidding ofc  great video  youre really having fun and being yourself and it makes for great watching. keep it up.
fantastic opening. the high pitch buzz was from your pcs power supply.
the dorito dust comment had me geekin  good stuff keep it up.
watch the critical drinker review on this also he makes some good points...really enjoying this content
should have known it would be trash when amazon was making it  they did the same with the wheel of time.
audio sounds good! I think moving the mic did the trick.
lotr is going to be as faithful to the books as wot was. its sad that they abuse the life work of two of my favorite authors since they ve passed and cant do anything about it.
I loved the jack reacher movies Ive refused to see the amazon series of jack reacher.your the best melonie
I love that you used the beyond meat lunatic for an intro.
when I first saw the galadriel in armour I thought she has a rifle on her shoulders and it was post  apocalypse world right out of the shannara chronicles joy
thought at first the photo of galadriel in armor was a random stock got photo.
subscribed to you the other day after watching one of the quartering s videos. after watching this video I now know that was a good call.
actually the last jedI taught me that lesson it taught me that  you cant unsee anyting  and Im not letting them ruin my beloved ip s  franchises anymore . I no longer watch anything on opening day I want to hear the reviews of it before I watche it and if I hear that they ve changed a bunch of stuff they will not get my money.
I agree with your points melonie as a Lord of the rings fan who has the first two lotr movie trilogies
1 billion dollars  flushed down the toilet lol. good luck  amazon
galadriel was already badass without the suit of armor.
dude you are awesome. thanks for the content
she looks like a medieval katniss  hunger games .
that opening though.
hey melonie! I thank jeremy for telling me about you. keep doin .
we got...doritos all over!
15 20. do you think that the fact that they didn t give her a beard is about the same thing they made the mandalorian take off his helmet as much as possible  its about highlighting the actor actress  not the character  Im not getting any info telling me why the character is beardless
og lotr   I ll die before I see the ring in the hands of an elf! new lotr  probably    I am sorry for the past evils of my people against yours  if our societies are to thrive  we must learn acceptance and tolerance.
the pooh meme on that one was insinuating chinese backing as xI jingping has been compared to looking like pooh much to his hate to the point winnie the pooh has been censored over there
the new galadriel looks perfect from the neck up...
I like how you wont look at the camera when you talk about the subscribe star. you dont like asking for the help but you know that you need it in this yt market so your eyes keep shifting lol. I noticed it in the last video as well. its a small sign of humility that alot of ppl dont have. stay humble melonie. it might not take you to the top but those ppl are all assholes and we all know it lol.
me being home alone  guys  Im eating junk and getting radicalized by melonie mac. you better come out and stop me!
seems like amazon is where sauron hid after the return of the king
I pray that it ll be good. Im also expecting it to fail.
see if you can get just some guy on the horn and ask him what he thinks the best thing to turn into a lotr project would be out of the legendarium. if answer wasn t beren and luthien  I d go vegetarian for a week.
this past event makes me so sad
just got done watching that opening clip on fleccas  this week in culture
galadriel doesnt need an armor. you saw how she fight in the battle of five armies. she has magic powers and she can obliterate you by waving her hand. well she wore an armor in fellowship  but in the illusion way.
to be fare I tried to get into this series but I had no idea all I got from it was evil dark Lord wants to control the lands
no armour was needed when galladriel saved gandalf in the hobbit her power was shown in all its glory. yet thousands of years earlier she needed armour and a sword is laughable.
is that galadriel  I was assuming it was eowyn.
oh shit Imissed your videos  let s gooooooo
galadriel s armor looks a  genderless 2  not elven. you can see chainmail. the shot itself made me think of game of thrones but not even close lotr in the slightest.
is it pizza with icky ingredients  in that case  she s motivating you to go to the gym she s a marketing genius!  p
what s with her uncaring look while there s an explosion behind her  I thought someone photoshopped that explosion.
once more the progressive skin suit cries out   y u no luv me!! amazon   b but Imade it better for you
r.i.p great entertainment Lord of the rings  star wars  star trek  etc. I have been stop spending money just been buying digimon stuff thinking of buying one piece stuff.
this show was a stillborn the moment they decided to call it  Lord of the rings   although it actually tries to be based on the silmarillion.why  because their target audience dont even know what the hell is the silmarillion  they probably didn t even read Lord of the rings either  and their only experience with middle-earth was the trilogy of movies which  by the way  they re trying to  deconstruct  now.
looks like I need to rewatch the epic rap battles of history george rr martin versus jrr tolkien
huh  weird that they brought joan of arc into tolkien s Lord of the rings. everyone is freaking out about galadriel but she never made an appearance. all I saw was joan of arc.
time for tolkien nerdiness. on galadriel. by the time of the second age she was one of the most powerful elves left in middle-earth. glorfindel arguably being the most powerful.  she s not really young either  she s one of the oldest of the elves still living.  did she wear armor  probably not. she did not directly participate in any of the battles of the first age. she was described as being as leader of the noldor rebellion but did not take part in the elven kin slaying. her power came from knowledge and wisdom. as to the dwarf queen. the skin color isn t much of an issue. the dwarves are derived directly from norse mythology. which implies nordic characteristics. however  the seven fathers of the dwarves were crafted not born.  they could possibly be the color of stone or metal ore. there are seven clans of dwarves but only durin s folk  the longbeards  have any major part in the story. she should probably have a beard. dark elves in tolkien s work are not dark because of skin color but because they never saw the light of the two trees. there shouldn t be any black elves. tolkien elves were not soy. they should be beautiful but in a fierce and imposing way. if the show wanted to include ethnic diversity  they could have included the haradrim or the easterlings. most of them served sauron but that was because they had been conquered by him. there were instances of them having resisted sauron and some specific easterlings fought against melkor in the first age.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.  c  j.r.r. tolkien
she looks like joan of arc ignoring commander akbar s warning as she walks through a battlefield.
lol the doritos and doritos dust. hahahahawonderful Bible quote. thank you for this again.
seeing this  I can feel something like dumb   dumber s got vibes radiating off of it....
dont worry about the mic placement - we aren t looking at the mic.I for one  am looking at the connect 4 game in the background and thinking  wow  she s almost as ocd as me!
this narrative about racism is getting monotonous. my word  cant we just live in a normal world.
death note is also my favorite anime.they are literally ignoring and disrespecting tolkiens source material.   keep being you and keep up the awesomeness.
its like someone just got of school for summer break. you seem liberated.
lol that opening
they know nothing. the elves  early history is incredible. there s no excuse for not knowing  people who may not have an easy time reading the books can get immersed with the audiobooks of the silmarllion  the hobbit and the Lord of the rings  andy serkis performs the voice acting for the hobbit and the Lord of the rings.
love the intro lol  also yup woke lotr amazon show is going to be trash ugh.
melonie mac would make a terrific elf.
Im new to this channel and Im looking forward for six days of fallujah cancel culture cant cancel it . but yeah me being a Lord of the rings fan boy it break my soul and lit video !
galadriel is older than the sun. if the story is in the second age she should be fully matured.
nope
not when humans exist
watching this new channel  it feels like you are finding your true calling and its a beautiful thing to see.
also I pretty much agree with you on everything .
Im going to give it a fair shot.  I think vanity fair could have cherry picked what they were given to make it look a certain way.  I love lotr and want to watch it  but at the same time  Im not the type to keep watching if something offends me  so if I dont like it  I ll be turning it off.  we will see.  but yea  they did elrond dirty.
it would be nice if just once they would stay true to the story  but that is asking to much I guess. I guess we will see.
I will at least watch the first couple of episodes because I dont want to prejudge too harshly. but I dont have high hopes.  good Bible verse by the way. I need to live like that more
will poulter was supposed to play elron and a much better choice. will actually looks like hugo weaving. as for galadriel  she s the most powerful elf in the 3rd age. even elron is scared of her silent ferocity. its such bullshit thatshe would ever wear armor or use a weapon. she stayed out the wars because her power was so great that war could corrupt it and her like it did to sauron and the witch king before. as for the dwarves  they have a grayish white complexion because they live inside the earth. they dont have melanin. and yes  the women have beards. which could have been a really good and fair win for transgender people. but no  they have to force diversity instead of stick to lore. there are darker skinned men in the east. and the show could have had an awesome story arch about the blue wizards  who have almost zero lore unfortunately  by following the wizards to the east and have their diversity there. where it actually was in tolkien s world. this is very disrespectful to tolkien and his actual  not just bandwagon woke mobs  fans.
question Im interested in the track you use for your outtro. what s the name and artist
the most important things are  the script and the acting skills of the actors. let s wait.
my favorite color is clear! -tolkien elves  probably lol
elrond is literally more  manly  than other elves  he is half man half elf.
mila kunis is definition of tomboy and shes awesome
I hold out hope for lotr ... but.. hope fades..
Im surprised they haven t removed the dwarves so as not to offend little people
hugely powerful being walked the earth during the second age and the story needed to be told.....instead we got the rings of power...
you did go on about lara croft with the drinker and it was glorious. as for this trash your right its all pandering and pushing the message. az from heelvsbabyface made a great video on this Lord of the ring  show  its well worth checkin gout. but yeah they dont care and want to insert their identity politics into another franchise so its  more inclusive.   tolkien set up a fantasy world with strict rules. if you dont obey the rules then it becomes a joke and falls apart. this new show is evidence of that. bringing in diversity into it makes mockery of tolkien s work and that is disrespectful. make up you own show stop tearing down our beloved franchise s. they only have access to 150 pages thats it  and they want 5 seasons of this  how  for a show that has cost an eye watering amount of money its going to flop and lose a lot of money. if money was still the be all and end all then this would not be made. I cant wait for nerdrotic and just some guy to rip into it. because they know lotr better than anyone else Ive come across. it could be decent but judging on the evidence so far it wont be.
this vid snuck by me but I just watched todays vid 2 21  started this morning  19.8k and finished after work and your at 20.3k after my 12 hour shift.  youre boomin .  gratz!
yeah  thats doogie howser cosplaying as elrond.
they murdered wheel of time and now they are murdering lotr. I hate this world.
thats not winnie  thats xinnie the pooh  the owner of modern american media.

Christopher really disliked Lord of the onion rings and the glorification of violence for its own sake   says tolkien scholar and wheaton college professor michael drout.  he was born in 1924  and so the big special-effects movie franchise thing was just not something he cared about. if his father hadn t sold all the Lord of the rings and hobbit rights to pay the inheritance taxes  I dont think Christopher would have sold them. after tolkien s death  his son Christopher took the reins of the estate and was famously protective  if not intransigent  about adaptations of his father s work  fearing commercialization at every turn.

mariana rios maldonado   ethics  femininity and the other in j.r.r. tolkien s middle-earth narratives  https   www.tolkiensociety.org events oxonmoot-online talks-prog  . her remarks have been widely distributed among big mainstream publications online  while the other side of the argument has zero coverage  apart from being framed as just  racists doing what racists do   without even asking anyone familiar with the works on what their issue is with it in the novels  the aforementioned things take place over thousands of years  but payne and mckay have compressed events into a single point in time. it is their biggest deviation from the text  and they know its a big swing.  we talked with the tolkien estate   says payne.  if you are true to the exact letter of the law  you are going to be telling a story in which your human characters are dying off every season because youre jumping 200 years in time  and then youre not meeting really big  important canon characters until season four. look  there might be some fans who want us to do a documentary of middle-earth  but we re going to tell one story that unites all these things. the showrunners clearly have great respect for tolkien  but you cant make a 50-hour adaptation without taking creative risks.  we think the work will eventually speak for itself   payne says when asked if fan concern and speculation ever unnerves him.  before an orchestra starts  audiences will talk to each other  but then as soon as the music begins  youre in and youre listening to that music. still think this is going to be a good story
you think the script will be free of agenda
and also  the hair thing. human genes.
he s called half-elven but he s got some maia  angel  blood in there too!
somehow  this production needs an intimacy coach for a show thats supposed to be kid-friendly. let thatsink in for a moment.
verse of the day  heck yeah keep it up!
deathnote you say  the original anime should remain untouched!! mind you that japanese live action 2 part movie was incredible  what netflix did to deathnote should be a crime against humanity!!  yeah Im a bit of an oldskool deathnote fangirl .
I had the special edition of lotr fellowship dvd it came with a doc call when power corrupts real good doc
ceiling mount mic  and have it drop down next to you so you dont have the long arm coming off the side  and interfering with your adorable arm flailing.
yep  I didn t even know that was galadriel. I heard it from you first.
melonie can you please post the link to the tomb raider discussion  I know youre a huge fan of thatseries so would love to hear your expanded thoughts plz thank you
it looks like the tolkien estate has gone from protecting the legacy and integrity of tolkien s work to just cashing in. translating lotr to the screen is one thing  but allowing someone to write-in new characters and stories on behalf of tolkien  then cynically slapping his name on it like he had something to do with it  is just defacing his work. like graffitI on a mural.
I thought the live action deathnote was alright
adding the Bible verse is very brave  I have much respect for you. thank you.
young elrond   its just a phase  mom!
ya gotta admit lizzo makes a convincing dwarf.
like you said  dont support it. we got to have convictions.
15 14  doritos...doritos dust
no please no  not lotr! Im about to up and let those great eagles drop me into the lava.
let s see how it goes then we can reflect back on your video and be like you told us so
thanks Ive been wanting to see your tattoo on that arm better
well said melonie  you nailed it - this series will sink under the waves of numenor
never thought id die standing side by side with a twitter woman
quick!  I need a persona 3 meme for protein.
looked up the debate of where the beginning quote came from. apparently she wonthe debate with 115 to 105.
oops I forgot! Im at the gym right now but I ll add that in when I get back. I think the vod is still unlisted  but if you go to the critical drinker s twitter he has the link he tweeted yesterday that will still direct to it. I ll add it in the description here when I get back too  thank you!
@melonie mac go boom   thanks
Im just waiting for the almost inevitable vesuvius - because if they dont get this right right of the bat  there s gonna be hell to pay afterwards  from various age groups . it might be the final  big failure we need to prove what we have been saying all these years to finally get through to many people. if anything  Im more interested to see how this series will affect the studio s bottom line. the streaming wars have had some pretty interesting casualties so far  and I thought the studio behind this would have been one of those left standing...
you ll be overjoyed to hear there s another  american  version coming.
rofl I am cackling
what about side by side with a youtuber
galadriel needs no armor. galadriel needs no sword.on a positive note  at least its not  boobie-armor .
there is a japanese live action death note you dont need a westernized version of it. same thing with gantz.
that intro  though!
6 57 this single pic has now finally revealed to me the true meaning of based. and I can appreciate it properly now. utter distaste for aliens   you d feel riiiiggghhtttt at home with the imperium of man then
its going to be educational.      the next ten years.
elrond and arwen are half elves - half humans  thats why they have dark hair.
if I saw that picture of the amazon version of galadriel without context  I would have thought it was some syfy channel show that was lotr inspired  but ya know  attempting to look like peter jackson s original trilogy and extra shitty cgi.
eh I rather wait to see the first episode before I judge it not being a worthy show just by appearances
omg! you were watching the crazy vegan lady calling british people colonialists - in england!!! she was calling the indigenous people - colonialists - in their own country! re  amazon s lotr trash - yep! if youread the books  galadriel had a habit of leaving  her foresight  right before the shtf! people would ve survived if they just paid attention to her movements  gladys! pack up the kids! galadriel just left town! . and while I hated the receding hairlines on the elves in jackson movies  what they did to the elves in this travesty is a crime! no flowing locks    wtf! and the elves were kinda color coded  noldor  black hair grey eyes. telerI  blonde silver hair  blue grey blue-grey eyes. vanyar  golden blonde blue grey blue-grey eyes. the silvan  green elves  were also telerI  but had the brown and russet hair and even green eyes. and the dwarf broad has no beard! she s not a dwarf! dwarf women look like dwarf men. dressed the same and everything.
she s a dwarf that likes golden doritos!!!
silmarillion is basically the Bible of tolkien. the similarities are astounding
this girl s accent is too damn cute with a great laugh! but  even better... not being a weirdo leftist  3
when I saw the picture of supposed galadriel I thought it was some random chick from gondor.they already destroyed wheel of time to  make a new game of thrones  now they will do the same to Lord of the rings
this is dead on arrival because they fired the lore expert and replaced him with a lady that essentially says   tolkien was a racist and I can interpret the lore how I want because he d dead.
for the rebellion!
power does not lie in a sword or the ability to destroy  power lies in the hand and the abilty to create and make a better life  galadriel in armor would be the weakest galadriel ever  her power was to unite
loving the new channel  and I agree. this new lotr looks like absolute crap! sauron will probably have pronouns and be gender swapped. I ll avoid the gaze from the eye of sarah.
for ppl who are not so familiar with the originac canon they will prop like it but other will agree with u
this is exactly what paramount is doing with the halo tv show.
wait  I thought that was a hobbit  its really elrond
tau  could you please repeat that last sentence again   readies an entire army of battle suits and drones .
@marinus van zyl   sure I can   prepares for a war of attrition you have no way of outlasting me in
more precisely  the following can be said about the origin of elrond  1 16 maiar blood - from great-great-grandmother melian  9 16 elven blood  including  5 16 sindar  from his grandmother nimloth and great-great-grandfather thingol  5 32 vanyar - from great-grandmother elenwe and great-great-great-grandmother indis  second wife of finwe  3 32 noldor - from turgon s great-grandfather  6 16 blood of edain  humans   his grandfather tuor is from the house of hador  his great-grandfather beren is from the house of beor.  he is also a descendant of the second house of edain  house haladin  through tuor s grandmother hareth.
heck  there was even that joke among gimlI and legolas when gimlI showed legolas that picture  how does anyone miss that   p
I feel like the only proper next step is to remake roots with a white and asian only cast  you know  in the name of equity and all that bs
can you do a video about your tattoo   I see an owl  an eagle I think.  cool profile on your shoulder.
did the talk with drinker video get removed  I couldn t catch it live and your link in the description is not working for me  sadly. I love his content and Im liking your videos quite a bitso that collab can only mean good stuff!
dark skin would most likely be the european darker skin like a light brown tan of the spanish greeks italian etc. but tolkiens world would mostly be a english west europe and upward with the fair skin tones
Im always correct. rangs of power will be woke and will disrespected tolkien s work
them   empowering women characters didn t exist before us  ..leia organa  sarah conner  ellen ripley  xena  hermione granger  lara croft  beatrix  the bride  kiddo  furiosa  rita vrataskI   and thelma and louise. I could go on but my point is  do none of those characters even matter to them
12 43 its ridiculous  there re plenty of various beings in  legendarium   orcs for example have almond eyes.
just wanted to say keep it up.
death note is such a great anime.
that young galadriel looks more like cirI from the witcher.
galadriel was a fighter according to tolkien so that part doesnt seem like an issue.
would have been a bit easier to accept if they created all completely new supporting characters instead of butchering the existing characters.
after seeing the pictures   abandon your posts! flee! fear for your lives!
galadriel literally is a mage not a warrior
that jerky intro lmao
carnivore crisps are pretty damn good though lol
same on the woman subject. I dont need or want a lot of female characters in this show. galadriel  arwen and  owyn were all kind  beautiful and feminine characters that I loved.women aren t automatically strong if they act or look masculine.lotr is my absolute favorite movies of all time  and I didn t need to see an independent wahman in it to absolutely love it.
my friend you bow to no one..great video
it looks yet another example of an adaptation in name only. like recent abrams kurtzman star trek. these weirdos have been trying to co-opt tolkien for a long time - even imagining that a staunch catholic born in the 19th century would have filled his work with race lgbt activist nonsense. it was the death of chris tolkien  his son and steward of his father s works  that meant there was no longer somebody left to protect the legacy from abuse. well  tolkien is long dead. we have his books and we managed to get an excellent film adaptation. whatever these cultists do now doesnt take those things away from us. I expect this show will not perform well.
elrond is half human...so his daughter also has human blood...hence the dark hair.
oops I put the wrong link lol! just updated the description with the right one  thank you for letting me know
tolkien says they have slanted  mongolian eyes.
I was really mad at the ending. does that make me a bad person
was she  I dont remember reading that.
tolkien never once says she was a martial warrior in his texts. the only things he mentions is that galadriel was at certain battles and only in one thatshe fought if I remember correctly.considering that by the third age she s one of the most powerful magical users in middle earth it makes far more sense she would have used magic instead of arms and armor. why not have her as a less powerful but still formidable spell wielder  it would have given the show a chance to use some flashy cgI effects and kept her character more in line with established descriptions of her.
look like us  australian and new zealanders  were respected and bringing jrr tolkien masterpiece to life  but amazon and  americans  with their stupid pc bs destroying a work based on medieval and nordic stories. I still laugh at these people s bizarre creativity failure but jrr tolkein wanted to continue lotr mythos with a sequel but knew  with the idea of a book called the shadow  to stop. I am not supporting this amazon fan fiction torture but I continue watching  again and again  the extended edition of lotr and playing some of the great video games based on middle earth. shadow of mordor has more respect for middle earth than this terrible idea for a show. shame amazon!!!!! shame!!!note  elrond was half-elf but choose his elf heritage over his human heritage. sorry  mel. I forgot to add there is a race of people of colour they are called in middle earth  easterlings  shaking my head.
in the words of the late great Christopher lee whom played saruman would of said about wokeism.  he whom is wokeish shall go brokeish!
weather we can live these changes isn t the point. this is a slippery slope to even more changes thats why we have to be vigilant
so is the chronology that the college years lotr gang are all obsessed with diversity and inclusion but later they all grow up and realise they were out of their minds
this will be a woke epic mess
Im already disappointed based on what Ive seen so far I know they re prioty wasn t respecting tolkiens legacy.
Im fine with warrior galadriel.  she had to fight her way with then other left out noldor had to walk over the helcaraxe and fight her way south. she didn t have nenya yet but had the light of aman in her eyes. 9nce she found what would be the golden wood and settled down.she left aman in rebellion with faenor. they left armed for war. she left for adventure and to carve a bit of middle earth for her own gloryplease read the books....
don carleon  look how they massacred my boy!!!
elves dont age so elrond and galadriel should still look the same!!
had no idea that was supposed to galadriel lol wtf
all acting is pretending to be someone you are not. I dont mind if the actor doesnt look like the character as long as they have the talent to portray the character s personality accurately. I dont get bogged down in appearances. accepting a white actor as an elf is no more difficult than accepting a black actor as an elf. what matters is the actor s performance. I am infinitely more annoyed by the changes to galadriel s character. I wonder how many times she ll complain about her armor not being perfect because it wasn t made for a woman and x-splain what s what to all the men.
10 06 and what s funny is they will do stuff like this like give a woman armor to make her more masculine and powerful but  in baby voice  stereotypical gender roles are a social construct.. and a man or woman can be whatever you want it to be but they sure have no problem clearly making women more masculine through the use of these  social stereotype constructs  and making men more feminine through the same.. their entire everything makes no sense.. then there s the elderly woman saying that meat is racist.. thats just how you know they re insane.first it was super subtle  all these vegans start popping up out of no where and veganism pops up as this trend.. innocent like.. now it turns out there was an agenda  coz now its like raising cows and eating meat is destroying the planet and causing climate change... and now since they cant prove any of that itseems they ve gone to their default  its racist.
nice video  good work.
its the real cultural appropriation.  they take a popular story  change whatever they like  and appropriate it for their own political purposes.
sent by the quartering. let the un-canceling begin!
younger galadriel yeah  but she s also an immortal elf. she s bloody 5000 years old in the age of this show.
the original japanese live action death note was good and was dubbed with the same voice over actors from the anime  and they also did l save world. the netflix one made me want to write my own name into a death note.edit   do I have an issue with the tomboy vibe  me   no  I have an issue with her having the shoulders of an nfl linebacker where cait blanchett doesnt. edit  I will respectfully disagree with you saying the woke movement isn t evil. it is textbook cultural revolution bs a la ccp. it can only be described as evil from where I stand.
winnie the poo in that meme is making fun of the president of china  because thats his nickname lol
best five seconds Ive seen in  long time.   can you believe that there are people in who believe in crazy sh t like that  I wonder how long she would stick to her believes if they where really tested  as in a a catastrophy or something like that  God bless fats and meats  all day  everyday.
in the vanity fair pics  I was more focused on the background in the middle picture   thought of a chocolate .
okay.....you say read the books. well please show me a direct quote or passage that tolkien wrote thatspecifically says galadriel was a martial warrior. I cant recall a specific passage that does.  she with celeborn fought heroically in defence of alqualond  against the assault of the noldor.  that was said in regards to feanor. its also said she escaped the sacking of doriath and thatshe and fingolfin were attacked by the host of morgoth after crossing helcaraxe. but I dont recall any mention of her fighting martially as a warrior.at least from my perspective it would have made far more sense to lean into what she becomes in the future  one of the most powerful magic users in all of middle earth. why not just have her a less powerful but still formidable spell wielder  I dont understand this need to slap her in plate armor with a sword and try to sell her as some bad ass warrior when there was no evidence that happened. Imean this is the woman who at dol goldur  threw down its walls and laid bare its pits . why not play up her ascension to being one of the foremost magic users of middle earth instead of some made up warrior version of her
of course they age  its just very slow. they are not immortal.
the galadriel thing is just a really really weird take...like why are you focusing so much on appearance and less on the fact thatshe s just a badass character whether she s in a dress or in armor  its like saying ellen ripley was  defeminized  in an alien movie because she wore a jumpsuit in one  vs being in a tank top and panties in another. idk I just dont get the argument and I think it is way too based in superficiality.I also just dont get the folks getting upset at a black dwarf...its not they recast gimlI as a black female character. like what s the issue with like black dwarves existing  just odd that folks are getting upset over it.
why do women have to look masculine to be strong  once you saw galadriel in the og trilogy you just somehow knew she wasn t someone to be messed with. it gets even better when youread about what went down at dol gulder.
doritos... doritos dust...
bad pic of galadriel  she looks lost or at least distracted in what I assume is meant to be a power pose.the dwarf   assuming she was cast out for doing something despicable for her beard to be shaved off completely  maybe supported by the stupid looking outfit are they doing a redemption arc for her are they bringing in dark elves  did tolkien have dark elves  which side were they will they be on
yo thats a dope lara croft statue
the thing about all this is its an exercise in stupidity. if the show runners wanted to add racial diversity they could have easily done it using the race of men. the lands of harad  rhun  khand  umbar  forochel and lands further south and east give ample opportunity to add characters of different human races. while the men of the west were based on northern europeans there are plenty of other ethnicities to draw on in middle earth. the fact that they felt they had to diversify elves and dwarves goes to show that the show runners and producers just did this all to prove they could.
meh  dark elves have been a thing I dont really see the big deal.
I am team sauron now...
Lord of the left wings . cant wait to never watch this . no matter how many gazillions jeff  minIme  bezos pour into this it will still be considered the batwhaman of the tolkien franchise . after the initial curiosity has settled it will just bomb hard. they dont care though and will release 3 more seasons while calling everyone rasists   woman haters etc. good times....
just about everything thing amazon touches turns to hot garbage. nothing surprising. I was excited when this was announced until I learned amazon was doing it. I have up after that
for anyone interested there actually were black elves they were called  swarthy  which means black.  and to say that galadriel a elf woman that has lived thousands of years never put on a suit of armor is ridiculous.  it is possible while fighting she wore armor otherwise that wouldn t be smart if she didn t lol..
how Imet elrond just hurts.
I just feeling a bit burned out by lor. I feel a prequel series is not needed.
this show is giving me bad fanfic vibes.
elrond was a strong father figure. of course they need to try to make him in to a soy boy.
wtf I got unsubscribed   ahem anyways....the gaslighting surrounding the lotr fandom is absolutely insane. fantasy stories games movies have always had an element of ethnic isolationism. dwarves and all elves would all look the same as the rest of their race because the races didn t mix. thats why outside love was  forbidden  or  taboo . there were plenty of characters in the lotr universe that could have been played by people who aren t white  just make them an easterling  southron  haradrim  etc. when there were no black elves or dwarves in the original trilogy  but somehow there is a black dwarf queen thousands of years previous  that is the very definition of immersion breaking. its not racist.
peter deviated from the books. amazon borrowed some names.
I really dont see the need for a new Lord of the rings series. jackson already left his mark not once but twice on tolkien and it just seems like anything else they add -- outside of the new video game -- is kind of unnecessary. I hope Im wrong  but its so hard to tell.also  is bezos becoming sauron  just wondering.
I think the pooh bear in the meme at 6 57 is a china ccp reference because the president looks like winnie the pooh  and hollywood is desperate for the china bucks.
name one time elven women are described in combat or wearing armor.
@shameen yakubu  did you watch the hobbit and did you noticed the female elf wearing leather armor   lol
@shameen yakubu  she fought at alqualonde in amann -- how about actually reading tolkien s legendarium once in a while  perhaps
@bart allen  Ive read the silmarillion youre right. that was combat but it was unplanned and during a great migration event  no other time are elven women ever described as included in true warfare like when the noldor held angband at bay for thousands of years or all the sacked cities  nargothrond  gondolin  etc . this is like comparing women fighting an attacker to women in infantry.
@shameen yakubu  apologise as I didn t  mean to come off as rude  though tolkien did state the following in morgoth s ring  to which he also provided variants of galadriel in aman  too    indeed in dire straits or desperate defence  the nissI fought valiantly  and there was less difference in strength and speed between elven-men and elven-women that had not borne child than is seen among mortals.  not so much specifically listed events but its one of the closest we have from tolkien
you obviously haven t seen how Imet your father  then  I take it   p
well  if you go of public perception  more like morgoth  not sauron    p
@marinus van zyl   hmmmm.
I saw the picture of the blonde in armor and absolutely didn t recognize galadriel. I found the woman awful in armor  and yet in france we are used with joan of arc. elrond in the second age is the herald of gil galad  we see him in the film when he wants to throw the ring into the fire. how awful !11 45 no  in tolkien all the elves are brown with white skin except for the vanyar of the immortal lands who are the only ones who are blond  because they stayed close to the light of trees of light during the first times of their world. galadriel has vanyar blood thats why she s blonde. legolas hair color is not described.
the woke crew doesnt understand this for some reason so I ll just spell it out as simply as humanly possible for their collective single digit iq. its not what you ve changed about the characters and the result  its the fact that you changed them at all. thats simply all there is to the argument. no lines to read between. there s only one line. stop fucking with the source material and inserting your personal narrative into fiction.nope. still nothing extra at the bottom. no fine printstill no hidden pointsy all gotta chill. there s nothing to find. stop looking for stuff that doesnt exist.
elrond looks like doogie howser.
it makes no sense to force funnel diversity into beloved creative properties such as lotr trilogy where diverse characters already exist in the novels   the faithful peter jackson adaptations.
love the content mel but the plosives are killing you
the movies changed a ton of stuff from the books  so when you complain about lore changes that were obviously made for storytelling purposes youre just creating a double standard.
as one who at one time was obsessed with tolkien  talking back in the 90s as a teen  I do have some news. there are 3 different stories as to how galadriel came to middle-earth. the oldest of the three is thatshe participated and was a leader in the rebellion of the noldor who  under her father s leadership  were trying to leave valinor for middle-earth. the reason given for why she wanted to go  she wanted to rule. it was only by happenstance thatshe ended up going a different path when feanor  her father  went to take ships from the teleri. when they tried to take the ships by force a fight broke out and the noldor ended up slaying the teleri. this kinslaying is why they received the curse of mandos and were barred from returning to valinor. the elves of middle-earth were not as noble as the makers of the movies portrayed. so I suppose there is a chance  if the image is from the time before the elves came to middle-earth  thatshe could been in battle like that. however  I dont think she did that in middle-earth at all. elrond is there  elrond was a half-elf. that means it would likely be in middle-earth.  and yes  elrond was half-elf so the black hair came from his human side.now  back to galadriel. she was a wielder of one of the three rings. during the time of the books she  elrond  and gandalf were the wielders of the three elven rings. galadriel was the one who called the white counsel back to order. the members were her  elrond  gandalf  and saruman. she wanted gandalf  the wisest of them them  to lead it but he refused because he didn t feel it would be good to be rooted in place. so galadriel wielded a lot of power  both magical and temporal.
an elf in a breast plate armour  wrong armour class.
there are a lot of reasons why its bad to change the race of the character in the book  the main obvious one is that they dont look like the character they re supposed to play. cant have an character that looks nothing like what he s been described as. this also messes up the whole lore of the story  like there s a reason why people in different parts of the world look distinctly different  thats because they had evolved differently from other parts of the world. are we supposed to assume that black people just sprout out of the ground in the middle of a village full of white people  making a person a different race with no background or reason is just immersion breaking. the other reason why I hate it personally is because there is an ideological motivation behind this. the people pushing for all these race changes are also pushing for  multiculturalism  and  diversity   in the clubs  workplaces and basically everywhere. the weirdest thing about this is they define this  diversity  as a place where cant be any all  white people  around. if a place has only  whites  in it  it has to be diversified. they never seen to push this on places where there s only black people  or only asian people. its only forced on whites  this is why in the mcu universe  asgard has a bunch of black people in a place based on a scandinavian legend and many of the white characters were suddenly turned black  while wakanda is 100 pct black. one argument against this  that people bring up is   without a diverse cast  people would be less sympathetic to the characters.  this idea is not only racist but also upsetting at the same time. a black person cannot sympathize with someone else who is not black  this is the part where I get why you said its insulting  its because these people making these diverse casting decisions just believe we humans are so primitive  heartless and our emotions so easily manipulated that we need these constant pandering to make us feel better about ourselves. do they really think they know enough about human race to the point  where they can just throw the same bullshit at us  thinking that we will take the bait every single fucking time  like how you can always get a monkey to the what you want  and all you have to do is throw a banana at him. we are not monkey s we are individuals who canthink for ourselves  we are not people who likes to be easily manipulated by stupid algorithms  calculated by a bunch of  diversity  goons to know what we people want to get the most money out of their audience. do they truly believe we just watch movies because of a person s race  because if they didn t fill the  strong diverse character  checkmark  people would suddenly not like the story  did they forget what makes a good movie in the first place  this is probably why the writing in many of these tv shows that were forcefully diverse was so terrible in the past couple of years. they cant write a good story because they are too busy checking off the diversity checklist and calculating what diverse character has to do what to make him or herself look better to the audience. they got the whole system wrong  yet  they are constantly surprised when people still dont like their shit.
thumbs up just for that intro! mmmmm. jerky!  lol
as someone who doesnt often flex my cred  read the silmarillion at age 10   it appears that the characterisation of galadriel by these showrunners is disturbingly shallow and opportunistic. let me explain. the first age for the noldor elves - of whom galadriel belongs - is one of hubris  betrayal  tragedy  grief  loss  extreme valor  courage and determination - but is ultimately tinged with sorrow and pathos. for her part  galadriel spent much of the first age in middle earth in the kingdom of beleriand  learning from melian the maia  of the same race as gandalf . from melian she learnt what some would consider passive magic  thatshe later utilises in lothl rien.what follows is the greatest tragedy ever written by mortal man. to say that the noldor elves that endured to remain in middle earth are sick of constant war and bitter loss would be an understatement. that is  the remnant of the noldor and silvan elves thatsurvived are looking to preserve and create in the new age  not seek and destroy. thus  I greatly fear that what some have conjectured about creation and destruction will come to pass. as those who can no longer distinguish between good and evil and see only in relativistic terms  feel that they now have ascendency in the world of matter.I wish you the very best of luck with this new channel.cheers.
18 58 there is a 100  chance that I wont be watching it and supporting it. the only reboot that has ever been truly worth watching is cobra kai. and then of course you have sjws trying to cancel that because its not woke. although its  realistically woke  imo  and that is fair because we do live in a world where people are woke.
so I never watch deathnote.and one day I heard that this popluar show had an live action adaptation.I watched it and was like oh ok not great  not terrible.years later I  binge watched the anime.and oh boy only then did I realize how bad live action actually was.same with coboy bebop.saw live action first then saw the anime.and man what a nightmare the live action was compared to the anime.now netfix is adapting one pieace  and I am afraid for my life that things wont work out
can you imagine a lot of white people in a movie about african mythology  I cant. but if you were to say they needed to put some white people in for  diversity  so we can have someone to  identify with  in it  those same people crying  racisist!!  for not liking changes to lotr lore would call you  racisist  for requesting diversity in an african lore.
in what universe is that elrond   cause its definitely not in this one.
so tired of great franchises ruined by wokism. lotr is going to be trash. the witcher is good show  not great   but netflix tokenized many of the characters in what s supposed to be a magical medieval version of poland   also made the main character a companion in his own show. they all need to stay true to the lore. I dont want a bunch of caucasian wakandans nor  diverse  casting when the canon says otherwise.
I think you can judge on the change of masculinity and femininity of a character. but I feel like bringing up race is a bit iffy. it really shouldn t matter what the race of a character is  specially as the lore is filled with different species. you can call it pandering but it isn t inherently wrong in introducing poc widely into a fantasy world. its fine to criticize but I think the use of poc as a criticism point  is a bit off.
I ll watch one episode Im hoping for the best  but expecting dog crap.
I think people are overreacting and focusing on the wrong things. there is far too much complaining about the racial makeup. there s no reason elves and dwarves would be just as variable in skin colour as humans. race swapping specific characters is dumb  but casting new and original characters as black is not a problem. I agree with the meme thatsaid worrying about story quality  and worrying about forced diversity  are not the same.
aren t elrond and arwen half-elves  maybe thats why their hair is dark
partially correct.  galadriel was part of the noldor who left valinor but she was not a leader of the kin-slaying.  she received the curse of mandos because she chose to follow her family   but she had a choice.  she not only didn t participate in the kin-slaying  she was appalled by it.  those who did were compelled by the oath of feanor and many did not want to kill their own kin.the movies didn t portray the elves as universally noble  they portrayed elrond as being on the side of the light   which is accurately from the books.  the into to the movies also portrayed the elves fighting against sauron accurately.  the movie didn t get into the conflict between dwarves and elves starting with mim because thats back in  the silmarillion  and wasn t germane to the story of tlotr.again  it was feanor s love for his creation  the silmarils  and the subsequent oath sworn by him and his sons that precipitated most of the troubles among the elves.
@colorado space geek  reread what I wrote. I said she was not with the group that did the kinslaying. duing that time she was traveling with fingilfin. later  when feanor and the rest left fingolfin and his followers stayed and begged for mercy from manwe. since they were not part of the kinslayers and stayed they were forgiven.
the worst thing of it all is that they could have diversity and good stories  but they refuse to write them  because of twitter. they are so afraid of twitter  that represents a minuscule group in any case   that they get so boxed in with their writing  that even if the race swapping wasn t an issue  its still turns out a pretty terrible story  because you need to pander to so many social groupings.
from the variety article  it looks like they want to remake got and call it tolkien  there s like one line where they contradict themselves completely - its not going to be  very  violent  but kids can simply close their eyes  like  what
I prefer to use the term  naturally diverse   as opposed to woke. otherwise people might get confused if they dont know the historical woke connection.
have you watched the original  foreign  live-action trilogy    of it yet  if you do  you ll understand why so many people were disappointed with the american live-action version of it.
tanx for recommending. ill definitely check it out
100  agree. I live in an african country and Im dying to see a fantasy epic about the african pantheon over here. because nobody mainstream is making it. there s not even fan films about them. the only movies that were ever made for them were by a minor nigerian nollywood channel  and even so  its kind of newish characters  not actually based on the Gods or Goddesses themselves.
I feel like this is different if you compare it to like a war movie based on our reality  if you gave a poc a role in the movie that doesnt fit with the time piece then yeah  you can call it pandering and even disrespectful to the struggles that poc have gone through in the past. a fantasy world though  I dont think it works the same  specially when race is more than just traditional humans in them.
in the silmarillion  galadriel was a minor character.  I think she was mentioned a few times.  the real problem is that every character written really since post september 11th  2001  must be .. must be a warrior archetype.  I know this sounds far-fetched  but I think part of our national trauma post 9 11  and the war in iraq and afghanistan which lasted 2 decades  is that every protagonist in every popular show must be a  warrior   even the women.  the result is something very 2-dimensional  bland  boring  and unrealistic.  go back to 2 - 4 decades  the original star wars trilogy is a perfect example and you ll find many more archetypes  including wizards  obiwan kenobI   fools  luke skywalker in episode iv    princess  maiden  feminine  leah    rogues  han solo .  why does every female protagonist have to be brienne of tarth  a barbarian-warrior    because we lack imagination and good writers and because  I think  2 decades of war  sapped our creativity.  most women I know would rather be a wise princess than swing a sword in anger  most of the time .  tolkien knew that knowledge is power.
I think people are overreacting and focusing on the wrong things. there is far too much complaining about the racial makeup. there s no reason elves and dwarves would not be just as variable in skin colour as humans. race swapping specific characters is dumb  but casting new and original characters as black is not a problem. I agree with the meme thatsaid worrying about story quality  and worrying about forced diversity  are not the same.
she looks like joan of arc.

daily uploads.  tommy likey  tommy want wingey
touch my gargoyles cartoon and they will pay.I fear for entertainment to come. nothing but reboots and reimaging s.and galadriel never wore armour  she was more and the magic.
why is elrond s hair short
agree we need to stop supporting this crap
cancelamazonlotr
when I first saw ooc galadriel I thought she was the gender swapped fingolfin  the name is probably spelt wrong or is wrong. . anyway her brother that was defeated by morgoth.this show is going to fail.
this tv show is not paying respects to jrr tolkien s
they think telling people over and over that if they dont like the tv shows its racist.it might work on some people but unfortunately they will create actual racists.some people will go thats why I didn t like it ! ok where my people at.
Christopher tolkien diessjws  time to ruin another franchise with out rainbows hehehe
evil cannot create anything new  it can only distort and destroy what was invented or created by the forces of good
from what Ive seen and heard it appears to be game of thrones style story with a Lord of the rings skin  but I admit Imaybe wrong and I hopefully am and its just bad promotion for the show.
where are the  body positive  elves
the worst was elrond  he looks like a blond justin tredeau.
will its a good thing I dont have amazon prime
pretty sure winnie the pooh in that illustration was intended as the ccp stamp of approval.
and elrond too  oh no...
truly powerful women never need to swing a sword. they have stupid men to do that for them.
salty army approves of this message!!!!!
doritos
oh  Im sure its going to be a great show... to mock on youtube! yeah! let s roll.
amazon ruined wot so I am not surprised they would ruin this as well.
a billion dollar virtue signal...
shan t be bothered watching this so corupted.
I cant watch remakes or sequels movie s or series since 2018 because there ruining my childhood.
I aint a simp but melanie is super cute

just like the witcher on netflix. I gave season 1 a try  refuse to watch season 2. its very insulting.
yes yes he was
talking about  younger  elves. do elves look younger or older  since they live forever
Im not a lotr fan.... but for those that are  please enjoy this time before this serie comes out coz things afterwards will never be the same as you get your  new fans  from twitter coming in  as is usual with this woke trash ... the disgusting reylo s and the pronounce bullies  the most disgusting people on planet earth will come in and divide the fanbase.

oh God I watched that intro and I got ptsd from when I watch that woman talking omg
good vid
Im sure thats joan of ark
I dont know if anyone noticed  but this shit will premiere on the anniversary of j.r.r. tolkien s death. the ultimate disrespect.
commenting to feed the algorithm
this will be 100  terrible. the best way to make our voices to be heard is to not watch it at all. I will look into 1st episode just to make sure.
the easterlings and the like had a darker complexion because they were further south. the only ones who had darker skin were the orcs  some of them  cause they were orcs. amazon. stop telling tolkien and tolkien fans how the lore is. please. and please no sex scenes. this isn t game of thrones
subscribed
sauron was less evil.
so what s the goal for these woke people. do they really think of they change everything within old media to their liking that we ll just give in and let it go. will they stop once there a nothing left to change in their image. this cant go on forever...
you know why they are sexing it up and doing this without much thought to lore...  trans-racial  trans-ethnicity  trans-whatever  etc.  it is a gigantic pander to that crowd.
please pirate the first episode  dont give them your money.
we have canine teeth. we are bound to eat meat.
how is she a dwarf   where s her beard
90s kids lol. most popular movie franchises were from the 70s and 80s. but you can have twilight  harry potter and the hunger games tho. I think those franchises started around the time 90s kids were old enough to  support  a franchise with their own wallets. nice vid tho.
is it really that hard to come up with originals  the backlash will not be bad if it was of their own creation. it is getting very unsafe to bank on original works and check all the boxes. rip star wars
keep preaching the word of the uruk. uruk uruk
thank you
heard youre a good egg
lmfao doritos
I love these fake gamergirl channels
beef!!!
that vegan old lady was super cringe funny  like wth lol
me new  you seem alright.
new sub here n ya uhh we r on apocolyptic times
its going to be like the 2016 ghostbusters. its not going to be part of lotr lore at all obviously. its more of a ripoff show thats copying and staining an amazing story. I seriously cant wait. going to be soooooo fun watching this fail so horribly
it feels like a horrible and poorly written fanfic and thats insulting to authors who do write those types of fanfics.
1  make tomb raider series2  cast melanie mack as lara croft3  profit
did you watch the daily wires most recent film
guys really.if you dont like something  dont support it.
tell me now  considering you haven t read the books  and dabbling doesnt count. how does any lotr tolkein story change in any way just because an elf is black or galadriel wears armor. also maybe wait for the whole show to drop before you judge  just a thought.
subscired!
I have my account synced to rumble too  d
there s multiple tomb raider lara croft fan films already - this was the first one I ever saw  its a fun watch  - https   www.youtube.com watch v bnqtw9v61jo
@marinus van zyl   ooo thank you
weirdly enough  it was only open to the us audience  when itsaid world premiere . I tried seeing if it worked for us international audience  but it remained closed to us.
fsheezzzzle how the sauron  they just think of underground people will get darker skin
I wont support that catastrophe thats not Lord of the rings  d
its like after stan  lee and and jrr tolkien died its seem the woke mob had there advantage on hollywood and politics that everything went to crap . marvel and Lord of rings are now woke and its fucking sad to see it happen to these franchises
so the prince of kazad-dun is white  but the princess is black     pls explain
nice tattoos
jrrtoken
I dunno. I wont be consuming that trash.
tomboiiiiii
damn  eating animals is racist now   guess Im racist.
the changes were made with malicious intent.  if you dont have gina carano to play the female warrior  forget about it.  it is just not believable.
there will be no dawn for men.
the whole thing reeks of wasted effort. a baseball player doesnt get to sue the crowd for striking out. next player up  have a swing..the onus is theirs.
that galadriel pic would be  fine  for a jeanne d arc movie  maybe even younger actress  but it needs to be more dirty and less elvish.
you were smart not watching the live action of death note. they butchered it and it was so horrible. william dafoe was great as ryuk but not even he could save that movie.
woke of the ringsthe rings of ignorance
trying to make Lord of the rings like the next game of thrones would be like dating someone just to change them into something they aren t.itsad that with all the tools we have to make the best entertainment that we lost the imagination. identity box checking is creative. it is lazy. I told someone before it would be like you have to write report on some topic and you copy and paste from wikipedia and change some of the words so you can claim you wrote yourself.
but dwarves aren t supposed to be striking lmao  they look like the men
elves are supposed to be pretty and never dirty  both male and female from the movies. I dont understand this change of direction at all.....
anyone who calls me a racist  is they themselves a racist. in my experience.
silmarillion already was the backstory  they could ve just made that  other races do exist  just not in the west.
if you copy and pasted from wikipedia  wouldn t that be plagiarizing plagiarized work   p
Im actually not a Lord of the rings fan although they were fun movies. all these direct to home streaming shows are woke trash. even the mandelorian wasn t that good. it was just better than the trash they had put out till then. lotr deserves better.
this movie is not factually accurate period  its like the writer and director didn t even research or ever watch Lord of the rings  its pretty obvious to us real fans who have to explain our complaints to the people who try to add on to something sacred.
welcome to woke of the fall amazon trash clown joke
why doesnt the dwarven woman have a beard  dwarven females were indistinguishable from males for those who weren t dwarves  or in the know.
whoever does the wardrobes for the amazon studio shows  its utterly terrible. they all look generic and bought off renaissance fair websites.
in middle earth  wouldn t  racism  be like dwarves hating elves or something  x
please stop the find another way   if needed  to reimagine this world.
its not looking good.
Im catholic and have received all of my sacraments.  so we can get married proper.  no pressure.  Im done with hollywood and the gaming industry  just regurgitating for dollars.  you would think at this point  they would become  woke  enough to realize to just make original content.  quit playing with classics.
high budget fan fiction.
the trash tolkien would never write.
wait  they spent a billion dollars on this crap  well I guess if you ve got money to burn...
wont watch that..
its been long since I unsuscribed from hbo netflix amazon prime. basically 99   of the contents are extremely generic  like made from the same director and team. do youremember when you last watch a movie and you could tell who was the director  who composed the soundtrack...  those years are gone. so   for the same reason I dont listen to whats on the radio  I dont pay for pre-packaged tv series or cinema.
its insulting because what itshows is that for a woman to be look strong needs to be like a man.
let me start of by apologizing for my racist   misogynistic harassment because Im enjoying a juicy steak burger with extra bacon
a woman with an opinion  run!!!!!!
where is the dwarf lady s beard  dwarfs be them male of female all have beards  and the female dwarfs are pretty much indistinguishable from male drwarfs.
amazon s new lotro looks like a cheap b movie to me  compared to the previous trilogies. something coming out from a netflix woke trash idea.
I wont be watching it. I didn t watch wot  or the witcher. and Im still alive and enjoy life without having that woke movement shoved down my throat. thank heavens for peter jackson.
more like elves hating dwarves. which we already got a taste of in the hobbit.
thats actually insulting to good fan fiction   p
90 s kid    born in the 90 s or grew up in the 90 s. you dont look that old.  my girl is tom boyish  still she doesnt like sci-fI  fantasy or video games. you dont look tom boyish. maybe not extremely feminine which is a good thing.  the show looks horrible. Im so disappointed already.
oh  this will be a dumpster . if they want to make a woke fantasy  tv show  make something original. there a concept for them.
wassup !!!!
u need to stop compare with the movie . the serie is set in the second  ge of the world. the event in the book  is set at the end of the third age
the thing about galadriel wearing a suit of armor is realy stupid... becaue galadriel is basicaly a freaking Goddess  if we speaking in the sense of power  a God doesnt need armor... he just fuck you up woth Godly power... having galadriel wearing armor is acctuly to ignore her gigantic power! not to mention. as beautiful as that actress is  they did a terrible job about showing the essence of galadriel... her eyes were suposed to sparkle in many different lights  and her hair was suposed to be so golden and beautiful that itshined! her hair was literaly suposed to have its own shine! they didnt do none of that... the black elf and dwaf pissed me off  but doing this to galadriel is what pissess me off the most  they took one of the most important characters in the lore and butchered her...
but muh black dwarves. we was dwarves n shiet!
is this going to suck  I dont know  but probably will  as most book to film adaptations do. and I know Im in the minority  but jackson s lotr trilogy  sucked in my opinion. so much cut out from the books in those movies that frankly  I felt disrespected tolkien s work.
woke of the rings its so pathetic.
amazon s  for everyone  gamble is not made for the fans. just like you said. this shitshow is for those who dont know the lore.
they are about to ruin lotr just like they are about to ruin halo. nothing is sacred to the woke crowd.
this show is going to be political hot garbage
its absolutely going to be trash.
wait  modern woman into God and Christianity too  what  take note  ladies. this is the bar.
I hope they re not but they ll probably be trash like the hobbit movies... those were so disappointing.
it ll suck  no point in watching  as far as the armor thing the most powerful women in history most times never led soldiers in battle.
galadriel was never an amazon warrior in the books.  just more woke trash.
it looks like an expensive trash
but muh diversity
watch something else!
another parody of a once great movie for the sake of  diversity . diversity doesnt make good movies but it makes great memes.
I was born in 1986. thank you so much  thats a huge compliment haha
@mike carson  you either dont know there are actual black conservatives  or youre just trolling for attention here      I dont like woke culture either . proceeds to defend it in multiple posts...
they appropriated tolkien s culture. this is verboten  of course! lol
khamul the easterling the  2 guy in the ringwraiths. this is a series about the rings of power  one of the wielders of the magical dingly dongs is a fucking easterling and they cant figure out how to include diversity into the cast.like literally end my suffering.
I dont care about the inclusion of multi-racial characters  it doesnt matter. and I dont think tolkien would be offended either. however  I will be annoyed if the script is cliched rubbish  with boring direction and  wooden acting.
if you wont to watch this trash  only on pirates sites  dont give amazon your money
I cant wait for this discussion.  if middle-earth was so diverse eras before... what happened to all of them
a Lord of the rings prequel could be so cool. but this just looks like wokist garbage
this is why movies suck these days. and yes I have watched half a dozen  ultra woke  movies and they all sucked.
you can say that about star wars too. thats the franchise I love and they fucking butchered it. rogue one and mandalorian are the only good star wars productions from disney. mandalorian was not even  amazing  it was good. boba fett was terrible and thats one of my favorite characters.
amazons woke Lord of rings is utter trash!!!! and netflix s live action cowboy bebop was an out right dumpster fire and a complete insult to the original anime......... same with the ghost in the shell movie. basically anything hollywood touches turns to shit......
yup. this alphabet of the rings looks like trash. will not support. as a poc I loved the lotr trilogy all those years ago.
what Bible is this psalms 27 12  do not hand me over to my adversaries   for false witnesses have risen up against me  and they threaten me with violence.
they believe woman is just a state of mind now so there s that.
I just hope its good. not another sjw checkbox movie that is a complete pile of trash. its like now days if the movie is full of sex and gore it wont be good or some bs. poc representatives is cool and all but the elves look strange af. I dont understand the need to de feminize a woman to make her powerful  thats flawed logic at least to my smooth brain.
no ..no..no..wtf   you pressed and surprised to see black elves   the book never said there weren t any black elves.  I didn t mind there weren t any black actors in old school Lord of the rings I enjoyed it but you trying to defend the racists that dont like to see black actors in anything is going down a slippery slope and I know you are better then this!!!   I give you @melonie mac the benefit of the doubt but this is getting really bad if you are going down this  maga road.
peter jackson s lotr diverted from the books considerably  but no one had a problem with his  vision ... this controversy is just an excuse for ill-informed people and anti-woke grifters to gain clicks through the usual culture war channelling  weaponizing popular fantasy film like they did with star wars  etc  to draw young people to the dark side... at the end of the day  people always have and always will move around the world  for example  africans were known to have likely been living in roman britain as soldiers  slaves or even free men and women.  by tudor times  they were present at the royal courts of henry viI  henry viiI  elizabeth I and james I  and in the households of sir walter raleigh and william cecil.pretending otherwise is at best ignorance  while being out of step with reality  and at worst  a reflection of a seriously messed up belief system
they didn t have darker skin like they claim. at most olive  light tan and plain white. the books were based on old anglo saxon britians lost mythology and lore with mythology and custom take from scandinavia scotland ireland etc. there are absolutely no black people in lotr. and thats fine. who cares its based on europe not africa  asia  north or south america etc. hollywood can make shows or movies based on african plethora of mythology from any country in the huge continent that it is  asian fantasy  etc. but no  they just use europe especially pre roman or medieval europe and add all races and just unrealistic standards where women have equal rights and fought etc. if its fantasy sure. but they re even doing it now with actual historically real people. so done with western media. this is coming from a brown ass arab btw before Im called white supremacist like I have been so many times
black dwarves and elves  sure lol  doesnt surprise me at all. but come on! they dont exists in the middle earth!
or manwe and orome sending the blue wizards to rhun and harad
I believe that is their goal  they ll claim thatsome kind of cleansing happened.

start watching foreign media. you get exposed to different cultures  true diversity  and you dont support the actually racist western stuff. you also get to watch great stories being told.
wow. as a woman  that is deeply insulting.
j.r.r. tolkien to henry resnick   rhun is the elvish word for  east.  asia  china  japan  and all the things which people in the west regard as far away. and south of harad is africa  the hot countries.   if you actually picked up a tolkien book you d realise that he based middle-earth on northwestern europe  aspects of pre-roman to be exact   however  there are non-marachian hador  non-white  present since the first age of endor from the moment the easterlings of bor and ulfang entered beleriand to live amongst the elves and first men   they shouldn t have changed hobbits  elves and dwarves to being brown black-of-skin  when they have the druedain of armenelos  could have taken liberties due to the rhun harad origin  or the pygmies which earendil  elrond s father  encounters in southern haradwaith in the book of lost tales  even the bloodlines of elros  elrond s brother  who mate with the women of harad to create a line of earendil as like gondor and arnor  which means certain brown black humans have the blood of earendil   but to state there are  absolutely no black people in lotr  ... I suggest actually picking up a tolkien book during numenorean expansionism or refer to comments from Christopher tolkien and tom shippey ...
they shouldn t have changed hobbits  elves and dwarves to being brown black-of-skin  when they have the druedain of armenelos  could have taken liberties due to the rhun harad origin  or the pygmies which earendil  elrond s father  encounters in southern haradwaith in the book of lost tales  even the bloodlines of elros  elrond s brother  who mate with the women of harad to create a line of earendil as like gondor and arnor  which means certain brown black humans have the blood of earendil
