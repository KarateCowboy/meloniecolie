I want my chain mail bikini.
men like hot women  women like hot men. its called biology. there s a reason why henry cavill is loved by millions of women and Im not. Im also okay with it as I like hot actresses. and those discussions took place in a woke hollywood not the rest of the world.
I always create my female characters as pretty and as sexy as I can. I am currently playing the skyrim anniversary edition again and they have these saints and seducers armors that make female character look super hot  I love them. I dont understand why you d want to spend hours playing as an ugly  blocky character. I prefer to play as hot male characters too.
sexualised male characters  cricketssexualised female characters   this is an avengers level threat! gotta love woke logic lol
if kotaku or ign are mad about something  Im probably going to play it.
my wife loves beautiful women. she just really appreciates the beauty of the female form and loves it when I play a pretty character so she can watch. let people enjoy things - if the frumpy and plain should exist  then so should the bombastic and wonderful.edit  man  I wish my grandma was still alive. she would have been thrilled to see a young lady like youreading scripture for people on youtube.
of course  because a man wrote this. melonie  Im pretty certain that anyone working for kotaku cant biologically be classified as a man.  they are either women  or soy boys  but not men.
kotaku scared of hot and badass and sexy woman  wow lol pathetic losers. love this video  melonie mac. keep it up with these videos
Im so grateful for you melonie and everyone else thatsees through this bs.its such a simple concept that most people play video games and watch movies to escape reality!!! we dont want to be reminded of ourselves in entertainment!!
the most desired male trait  strength  of character  of mind and of body . as opposed to undisciplined  pathetic and frail.the most desired female trait  beauty  of character  of mind and of body . as opposed to uncaring  negative and disgusting.lost ark is a power fantasy. a story where the hero is perfect in all ways and surprise-surprise all the men are walking slabs of prime beef and all the women are walking wet dreams.
thank you! it is so great to hear honest  actual Christian values. not hate or defensive overreaction  just faith and love and letting him be the judge. came here from the quartering  staying for the content.keep it up and God bless!
dude  I am  in no way  religious at all. I have always disliked religions but this psalm 91 youread at the end almost brought me to tears. my grandmother used to tell me this everytime I left her house. she would never let me leave without saying the whole thing  word by word  from memory. I always thought it was some bs prayer thatshe made up or something. never knew what it was. I would just stand there  waiting for her to finish it. I joined the military and left my country over 10 years ago. I only saw her a few times after because of always being deployed and stuff. she died at the beggining of the pandemic and I haven t even been able to visit her grave. ever since I joined  I have regretted my decision as I feel that it robbed me from all the time I could ve spent with her. I guess all I wanna say is thank you. now I can keep this psalm with me to remember her. if there truly is a God up there  he is with you.
mansplaining by male feminists  lol!  guys please stop telling us gals we should be offended by beauty  youre not helping anyone  especially not women.  playing ultra-feminine characters is like grown-up make believe for us!  oh that dog meme  haha.
new world has exact depiction of female characters kotaku wants  somewhere between looking like a man and an amorphous blob  and guess what  the amount of women playing that game is basically 0 for that exact same reason  whereas ff xiv and lost ark are very popular with women.
idgaf what anyone says.  -real artists
I really appreciate your insights. really cool getting pop culture  commentary  and a daily devotion all in one. I really like you deliver it all without anger  rather with a contagious  laugh. btw  all my characters super buff bad asses! dont want to play some beta male.
excellent vod  mel! I love beautiful sexy women in video games. absolutely nothing wrong with curves  thickness  bare legs  shorts  sexy outfits  and a bigger set. the woke and male feminist allies are lunatics. they just dont like hot sexy badass women  and especially the outspoken women who dont agree with their naratives.
when you have the looks to be main stream  the intelligence to change your perspectives  and the backbone to stand up for what you believe  you earn a lot of respect from people and hate from the sheep.
itseems as if the folks making this game just ignored the last decade or so of discussions and debates surrounding representation of women they should put that review on the dvd case  never heard a better sales pitch in my life  where can I buy this
great channel melonie. love your energy.
back when ch was actually funny.
I would hate to have a chain mail tong that would cause many issues
I want my female heavy armour for my tank thats basically a bikini...  also  wonder what melonies take on sony censoring martha is dead would be  hm
red sonya indahouse!!!
@cheeseburger cake  Christ  thats such a stupid move. the puritans have taken over sony. thank God for xbox and pc.
talk to xerxes tailor in the movie 300.
@le radmuiel  well it really blows my mind because of the scenes in for example the last of us part 2 are in my opinion way worse than anything being cut from martha is dead. Imean honestly the scene where abby is getting fun time is probably the most horrifying thing seen in any game ...
@jakemonster001  could a conan red sonja inspired game like the golden axe series even be released in the usa these days  even the dudes are running around in their underwear.
and I want you to have your chain mail bikini. every sane person does.
@douglas palmer  lol
what a novel concept lol
women like hot women too! fashion forever  baby!
@jilted kitten  and plenty of guys like hunks and studs  even if they re not comfortable vocalizing it yet. lol the value and appreciation of attractiveness is universal and timeless  even if specific beauty standards fluctuate
... and many gamer girls want hot women for their avatars!
@celf help  thats very true. attractive people are always more popular  not just with the opposite sex. its also a well-known fact that their chances of climbing up the ladder in their job is better too than for unattractive people. this is just how human psychology works.
henry cavill is also loved by men and nerds. he s like ryan reynolds  he appeals to all walks of life.
@max master j  thatd be cool. I d play a good conan anything. even a puzzle game.
found her videos today subbed today.   wear your shit and be proud you look good in it .   you have no idea how hard I laughed when she was like  oh and of course the article was written by a man!  cause we should ask more men how they feel about female representation right   if I shake my head any harder im gonna get brain damage.....not that its not already there  .
@le radmuiel  pretty sad when nintendo stopped censoring and sony started.
exactly. as a dude I want the men and the women in a fantasy to look hot. the guys should either be conan or bts  the girls should either be witchblade or lara croft.
I dont understand why you d want to spend hours playing as an ugly  blocky character. yeah I dont get why people like minecraft  either. I was all about tifa s polygons back in the day though.
@niko the arms dealer  you dont have to see steve  you have to see these characters in 3rd person.
armor of the old Gods. that is all...
@niko the arms dealer  lotta of people believe gaming peaked with 2d pixel sprites.    I did install a variety of skimpy armors in skyrim myself  though I had to balance them with my desire for lore consistency. hard to rock the chain mail bikinI around winterhold in a raging blizzard.
@rob  my pfp comes from such a game but Im not biased enough to agree with that. I do believe the 90s were the most innovative period but things did continue to evolve. the late 2000s are where I think things began to level off.also I guess I have to spell it out for some folks but the dig at minecraft was a joke.
@rob  with some exceptions like silent hill 2 and resident evil remake on nintendo gamecube  3d graphics date pretty quickly. 2d animated sprites and 3d games that dont go for hyper realism and have a style like legend of zelda breath of the wild age much better.
@rob enchant thatshit with ice resistance - it actually stops hypothermia... like itshould. be a nord  be a vampire  run around in your undeadwear not giving a fuck.
@Im a friend of sarah connor  even today remake still looks absolutely amazing. the atmosphere in that game is incredible. but youre right about games like botw. this is why  despite twilight princess still being my favorite zelda game  wind waker looks way better for its age.
Im a straight dude  but when Imod my skyrim   schlongs of skyrim  is always one of my most important mods...   also  when I play with a female character in  dragon s dogma   the first thing I try to do is get the thong from the chest in the camp of the female bandits...
yeah I agree  its only when a hot women is there that they go crazy. I recently played spiderman remastered on pc and got a cosmetic skin for spider man that put him in his underwear and mask only with a 6 pack n all. my first thought was that it was funny  and then that it was cool because it made everyone a 1 hit kill including peter. and like a normal human being I had no problem with it. then right after I got to thinking  there s no shot they would ever do the same shit for a female character. they would get so much backlash from the woke crowd.
bahaha trueeee
very well put
but... I like beautiful men. lolits okay  Im sure lost ark would let me make a beautiful alucard sephiroth looking man... its a korean game after all  and they always have that option.
@z hawkmoth  western games   you ll play by our realistic beauty standards. korean games   we got sliders for everything. everything!
me too josh  jeremy s good people - always trying to help other creators.
everything you said.
man not of religion but of science but respects those who choose that path.  thankyou for helping me believe some of you are still following the beliefs you espouse   youre a great person thank you
@joshua wargo  10 to the 50th power to one. have a great day.
@steven thomson  lol I will but now imma be doing math in my head all day fxer xd lol
@joshua wargo  lmao just remember statistical mathematics is a science and  that number is known as an impossibility. and there s 7 billion of them atm.
this brought tears to my eyes  bless you
it true
damn what a bait! almost fell for that.
@skrellowtyper  fell for
@wayward l80 fuget about it I overrreacted
my wife only plays big-boob female characters with tiny waists and skimpy clothes. but then  remember  the definition of woman is now  formless  eternal  limitless   so  cthulhu
we tried new world. we didn t leave cause we couldn t look pretty  we left like everyone else because the game ended up being trash.
no no that was party rocking
steam
its free to play.
as they should I guess lol
this kind of  problems  are just insanely stupid. kotaku is still alive    way to go  mel!
another banger from kotaku. they just cant stop with these  hits!
kotaku is scared of hot women   -a hot womanyou just gave them high school flashbacks. next video  melonie mac induces ptsd in games journalists...
amazon  one of the  wokest  companies right now  delayed the release of lost ark to censor a whole bunch of armours  to diversify a lot of the npc s and to make it more palatable to the western audience  read whiney game journos  and kotaku still finds fault with them despite the altering of these things annoying long-term fans of the game  it was released years ago in korea . the woke brigade can and never will be pleased  so companies need to stop worrying and pandering to them and return to making their target audience  whether it be gamers or show viewers  happy again  as let s face it  we re the ones that will spend money on the product.
lost ark and revealing armor  lol zack  would probably get an brain malfunction if he would try out blade   soul! xdbtw. thanks mel for releasing so many of these vids! keep up the good work!
coming from another straight female tomboy  I love nothing more than having an outrageously outlandish and beautiful female avatar in a game. its fun! thats not how I am irl  so it really is a fantasy thing.   _   _   simple as that!!
there goes kotaku going for those clicks again. if I recall correctly  they published something previously criticizing critical role s latest campaign  which fans didn t have too many problems with. and even looking at their site now  there s an article talking about how xbox s game pass offerings are a  snore   in spite of the fact that games like mass effect  legendary edition  super mega baseball 3 and alice  madness returns are mentioned. they re thriving on not-so-controversial topics and negativity and using them for traffic.anyway  another great video  melonie. keep  um  booming  exploding  whatever  keep it up!
hotness should be celebrated  protected and something to be proud of  not hidden and suppressed.
I am extremely offended they omitted the clear unrealistic male characters. its so unhealthy to expect us men to all be built like body builders or male runway models. we all cant be henry cavil or the rock.... I am so triggered I dont know what I will do... oh wait  I am gonna go play more lost ark cause its the best game out right now. cope more kotaku!
they need to start giving male characters  dad bods  to be more  realistic  lol
these people are so transparent. they dont want everything to be  inclusive  and  representative . they want it to be gay. unfortunately for them the majority of people are straight and funnily enough  there s nothing wrong with that. if you want a game where you cant tell the difference between men   women  then go make one. Im sure kotaku will love it.
if only the gaming industry still had the vision and creativity of the 90 s and early 2k s.
happy tomboy tuesday to you too! lol at 4 07 they have to write about this to score points with their  allies  you know to try and cover up the skeletons in their closet.
love how you handled that piss poor crafted agenda email  you earned this sub. it is not for us to decide what is a sin  we can give our opinion but ultimately its between you and God. you may believe you are in the right  thats fine  but just like you have the right to voice yourself  I have the right to voice myself. neither of us has the right to impose our opinion as fact on the population but some will try anyways. like kotaku s zeta male feminists who have apparently crowned themselves as the authority on acceptable women in video games. apparently curvy attractive bad ass women in video games films triggers and offends this weirdo sub-species of the human male. the rest of us collectively meme and laugh at them.stay blessed.
youre such a badass Christian for real. youre videos get me way stoked and I love how you handle things!edit  really loved that comment about how outspoken faith in God is the new punk rock!! thats so true. Jesus was totally punk rock. he was a young man willing to die for the message he was bringing to people. he always stood up for his truth. I could go on and on.
I just want to say I have had a rough time being a believer. I didn t fit in with the over zealous religious types and mostly hung out with non believers. but I had a hard time sharing my beliefs to anyone. I just want to say I appreciate your courage to share your belief. and also that you show that believers can be cool.
if we hate each other  we re easier to control  is one hell of a comment that deserves way more attention. so true. thank you.
this is exactly why I subscribe you because you not woke  sjw or be some crazy things  and thank for be a voice of us for told what exactly we think
your channel is amazing  I found it today! I got here from  the quarteringwas watching him like every day  was watching the lotr videos  went back to home youtube  and saw your video in recommended. glad that happened you are really entertaining and you make  videos just what I like  and are the best keep going  mutch love from serbia  3
so they portrayed women as beautiful  powerful  special  and something desirable... the horror.
I think that their issue with it is that hotness is not  inclusive . they want everyone to be plain and ordinary-looking so that nobody feels left out. but where s the fun in that  I see plain and ordinary people every time I go to the supermarket. when I play video games or watch movies I want escapism.
also protomail  is the  new  antI tracking email  a lot of people are migrating to it to not be tracked by google microsoft
most gay guys I know prefer looking at hot buff males than unfit androgynous weaklings - in fact most gay guys I know are better at attaining and maintaining that physical ideal than hetero males like me  especially once you enter your 30s. mind you  they are also old enough to be as cynical and appalled as I am about this latest wave of wokism that has become the new orthodoxy in every aspect of our lives - politics at every level is permeated by it  there s now no escaping it at work  the big corporates are as bad as the public service   and even worse  the things that we used to enjoy as an escape from the sometimes grim reality or boring routine of our lives - sport and entertainment - are now just another woke battlefield we have to navigate. I respect melonie s faith in Christ although Im not a Christian and have enjoyed her take on things since coming here from the quartering but her response to the guy re faith and homosexuality has cemented my decision to subscribe to this channel  she will take responsibility for her actions as a committed Christian and - hopefully a very long time from now - will be judged accordingly but she does not feel it is her role or responsibility to be casting divine judgement on others  especially when it comes to what goes on between two consenting adults behind closed doors. indeed it would be the height of arrogance to assume such power. not sure how old you are melonie but your approach to this  issue  suggests a very wise  thoughtful and mature mind at work. all the best for the new channel.an  old school  liberal  you know still subscribes to the ideas of george orwell  martin luther king  etc.
holy crap I think I just experienced a tinge of what simps experience when I got the notification that melonie mac  senpaI  hearted my comment.
come on in and enjoy freedom and liberty in american youtube
that example of an ideal female body type for a kotaku writer at 8 53 is not just accurate for the shape  but the kotaku types will often ask where are the girl s organs  and so with that body type  you can see the organs they for some reason always want to see.
this is for sure my new favorite channel  look forward to a new upload everyday after a long day of work. keep on keepin !!
I remember playing an mmorpg years ago called last chaos with a male character that had a barbarian armor that left all the abs out in the air. and I didn t cry or anything
I grew up reading heavy metal. zach s head might explode  but I d love to see that aesthetic revived in modern games.
just came across your channel. you made me laugh so much  and really liked your opinions. you seem like the nicest and coolest Christian I have met  not Christian myself but I respect your views. absolutely loved the video and subscribed now
mel. never fear. you cant be stricken down. faith prevails. be adamant in everything you do. spread love and joy everywhere you go. stay real. stay true. never lose sight in who you are. you need not worry. everything is going to work out. and thank you for the powerful message.
melonie s laugh is amazing lol
as a man  I have never been bothered with playing as guys with massive biceps  6 pack abs  and perfect face. guys love chris redfield  doom slayer  dante  and kratos. we aren t hung up on how shredded they are. I feel most women think the same about lara croft  samus  chun lI  and 2-b. let the beauty come back so everyone can appreciate how gorgeous women are and can be!
glad I found your channel  you crack me the hell up.
been playing lost ark and enjoying it. the voluptuous female characters feel authentic to the genre.  doesnt bother anyone who s secure in themselves.
just founded your channel in the great legendary critical drunko s  big fan of him btw  after-hours podcast and I really enjoyed the vibe you two have given upon discussing your views on the topics.  I subbed instantly after watching the 2-hour vod because I really like your personality. discovering that you are also a non-zealous Christian who is willing to bash every idiotic brain out with a hammer of pure maturity and enlightenment is a big plus and made me an instant fan. Im looking forward to your channel to go boom. have a nice day
yoooooo I wish we could get a melonie mac read audiobook version of the Bible. you are a much better narrator then my current one. keep it up melonie
love you ms mac! stay based!
love the content! keep up the good work
girlymen everywhere.  guessing this guy is from la.  I work on films there  and I remember a guy saying in the next ten years breasts will not be considered sexually attractive  and that they shouldn t be.  I thought  sure buddy  thousands of years of breasts being attractive  because nature   and wokies are going to make them unattractive in ten years  because  the conversation  .   gotcha
your smile  accent  and laugh cheers me up  so glad the quartering suggested your channel  great vids too!
loving the content  please keep speaking. excellent job as always!!!
the female figure has a different shape than men  so I think you have an opportunity for some unique style plate  half plate and so on  types of armor. that being said  Im all for dressing your character however you like. the more options the better.
I didn t know sexual attraction could go out of date. man Im a caveman by kotaku s standards.
my wife helped make all my female characters hot! she loves anime and fantasy games. in tera online she was playing all the little cute fairy ladies. she feels this is a beautiful game.
lucky man!
lol! the log into a video game and live real life again moment got to me. funny but true commentary
these creeps constantly stalking melonie and telling her who she should and shouldn t be friends with and what opinions she should have are a sad bunch of powderpuffs. Im guessing they still sleep with stuffed animals and drink out of sippy cups.
your understanding of the father is very true. Godbless you and your mission.
boy was thatscripture so relatable in my life atm. please keep them up!
as someone named zach.. uh  youre welcome   I swear Im not a male feminist lol
when I was a kid some of my neighbors had grown up in the soviet union and later fled to the west. they could tell horror stories about what life was like there. all someone had to do was just make an accusation to the kgb and they would come for you. there was no trial  no lawyer  you were sent straight to a re-education center. you had to fall in line with the state in your speech and everything else. this is alarmingly similar.
from the time that I was really little to now  being 21  I always loved the hyper-femininity of stylized characters. I love being a woman and so I love exaggerated female characteristics. it feels almost mean-spirited  dare I say  misogynistic   to say that exaggerating female characteristics makes the characters shameful.
hey melonie  a minor suggestion. when showing websites  you can use adblock plus  or anything like that  to block ads. you never know what ads will appear  it might be better to hide them when doing a video. you canturn the ads back on after  to support your favourite websites.
thanks zach what would we do without you  me  have uninterrupted fun
thank you for you quotes. they are uplifting. thank you
the guy who wrote that article basically pictured in his mind what would happen is a sea of women would hold him up and pass him around while cheering for him after they all read that article  kinda like how the freed slaves did with danerys targaryen in game of thrones.that would have been a nice hilarious meme for someone to post
you are completing holy work mac. a new generation of men and women are in need of knowledge and you are in the midst of teaching some. God s will be unto you. hibukim!
preach! I want my video games to have tons of beefcake and cheesecake! I want to get away from my plain uneventful world and delve into games of magic or sci-fI and kicking ass  slaying babes and laying monsters...... wait  reverse that last bit.
prefacing by saying Im a surly gay dude. the type of guy you d expect to lift half a pine forest and drink a keg of whisky after before shaggy a harem of dudes level of burly. I think youre hilarious  charming and exactly what this space needs. hard to offend  upbeat  positive  open minded and boasting a rapier wit. youre a daily watch for me  and Im just glad Im saying it now when youre at 18k  before you hit 500k in what ... a month   ha!  give em  hell melonie! go boom! light up the night!
so  my wife is korean  and I lived in korea for a few years.  they have a fetish for beauty  it is the plastic surgery capital of the world for a reason .  if kotaku would take some time to actually learn about another culture and why they design their characters the way they do  then maybe they can actually understand that concept of multiculturalism that they believe they embrace.  instead  they just try to shove their cultural beliefs on every other culture in the world and cry about diversity when they are the ones killing it.also  my wife will not play a game with ugly characters  female or male .  she does care about looks that much  I dont  I play games for game play and story  and looks trumps game play and story for her.
love you nonfiltered views.  keep it up.  your new channel is awesome.
I never even heard of lost ark until this video. gonna have to check it out now. cheers
itseems to me like kotaku and the woke left celebrate women being masculine  and men being feminine. no wonder they get offended by anything perceived as  super  feminine like a video game character. also makes sense why they cant handle you. youre already a femme fatale. good looking  great mind and the confidence to speak out  keep slaying the agenda melonie. loving the content.
more laughing!! its good for you and its funny too
actually the scripture most people take to mean dont get tattoos refers to placing marks on your body that give others claim to you  and putting names of the deceased on your body. Im not very religious anymore  but I used to be  and I did a deep dive into this prior to getting my tattoos.
oh shoot good idea haha! I will do that moving forward  thank you
aw shucks  what an amazing comment. thank you so much
you got it. its about mimicking pagan customs of worship to other Gods  not coloring your skin.
remember that the prophets of baal in 2 kings also did this cutting their flesh thing while crying out to their God  during the miracle on mount carmel where elijah called down fire from heaven . but I dont agree with her opinion on homosexuality- I believe the Bible is pretty clear that any form of deviant sexuality other than what God gave humans in genesis 2 is sin  and this is made clear in the new testament as well. God changes the hearts of any and every person who comes to him by first convicting them of their sin and then making them aware of their need for salvation. it is important that as Christians we expose the darkness of sin and shine the light of Christ on the individuals we meet. Jesus and the apostles were very bold in their teaching  and we ought to follow their example. pointing out sin and calling for its correction is not a bad thing. the new testament does not command hatred  violence or any discrimination against our friends in the lgbt  community. rather we must condemn their sin  not the people themselves.
lost ark s continued success is fueled by kotaku tears  -
thank you so much  melonie! I had to wait until I got home to watch so that I had the time to sit down and pay attention. I ll never look like roidy kratos or those gears of war guys  but I never thought they should be changed because its a video game. I dont want to play as a tubby guy with a beer gut.
happy tomboy tuesday  mel! hope you are having a good one.
melonie  I know you dont read much  but I want you to know in any of the fantasy sci-fI stories I write  the women are hot and the men are handsome. thats how I like to depict my characters  and its how I assume most readers want to imagine them. its certainly how I imagine them when reading other people s work. men I d like to be  80 s action stars   strong knights  etc  and women I d like to date.
people need to stop giving that trash website any views  great show melonie keep up the good work.
never thought I d use this word  but that Bible verse truly is  empowering !  thank you for sharing it!
I am gay and I fear no man s judgement. it has been quite nice to see you bring the Bible into your videos.
I think kotaku should go on a hunger strike until everyone looks at things like they do.
thanks zach  what would we do without you
pro tip  if someone blocks you on twatter just log out and go to their thread.  unless they ve made their account private you ll be able to see what they are tweeting.
the people writing articles for kotaku aren t journalists  they re insane people who wouldn t know a good looking woman if one slapped them in the face with a frying pan. then again  depending on how hard they were hit  they wouldn t know much of anything anymore...
my mom loves mmo s and she always likes building thatsexy character lol   her one of her favorite famous actresses is marilyn monroe. and every girl gamer I know is the same .
ahh kotaku.. its been more than a decade since I heard that name. who knew they still existed huh.
kotaku hating it usually means its amazing
such an infectious laugh lol myself.
loved pete smith s icon when youread his post that was gofundmao lol. protonmail Ive seen a few people switch to over the past 5ish years due to them being either banned or censored by gmail or google in some way. bless you mel.
the funny thing is thatshe still wont sleep with you kotaku
damn why does kotaku have issues with hot tomboys such as yourself melonie
every video has a verse  its like veggietales lol. this channel is awesome!
cool  tomboy  gorgeous  smart... also is Christian!!!I know nobody is perfect  but    miss mac you are the nearest to a perfect womantons of blessings miss mac  for you and your family!
I actually use proton mail  I like it because I dont want to use gmail. the big draw back is it is easy to set up a free burner account  dont have to link a phone number like gmail  so people use it for that quite often.quick edit. I do have gmail and used it when Imade this youtube account but I eventually switched over.
I wish I could have a conan like loincloth be effective armor in a game! screw realism  I wanna look like a pro wrestler barbarian with a giant axe  who drinks  carouses and beats up giant monsters. people need to understand that our fantasy entertainment is an escape  not reality nor a morality lecture.
1 40 ellie from the last of us hasn t been sexualized at all and she is one of the most popular  well known and loved female characters in the last 9 years....
I really dont get why people who did not actively play video games or have any intent to jump into the video game medium subculture love to dictate to people who are buying and playing video games how they should betray people or how their stories should be told and stuff like that its dumb and in my personal opinion I think its one of the many big factors that are kind of ruining games for me personally and have been for the last couple years
amazon even censored the women s outfits for the western release.
I see the same thing about people complaining when marvel female heroes are showing any cleavage or skin. yet the people complaining about that have no issues with the guys having shirtless scenes in every movie. majority of people like looking at pretty people  and there s nothing wrong with that.
the best armors are the one s that barely cover anything up! its a known fact they have the highest ap value! so when we getting the full sermon  xd
how do you feel about homosexuality  is it a sin   to judge belongs to the Lord
the only thing this article did was to peak my interest in the game itself  and if I actually had time to delve back into an mmo I d be all about it.
greetings from brazil. please continue your work!
coming from a chick that grew up playing games  I have no issues with hot female characters. hell  I tend to create my female characters to look like how I would like to look. its nice to get out of the crap of the real world for a little bit and run around in fantasy worlds as a hot warrior chick.
I remember some feminist screeching about a female superhero and she said that the design should be changed because  no women look like that.  this chick replied with a photo of herself and she looked exactly like the drawing. like  you d think it was a portrait.
its interesting that its only a problem when there are attractive females  but attractive males are never a problem within gaming  movies or shows. just interesting that the groups who always want to  cancel  attractive women are never there for the men..... kinda telling of the  type  of crowd they may be.
I didn t even know they nerfed skins on the game. interesting video
unfiltered mac  loving it
I absolutely love that actual women are rallying against all this woke bullshit of  women cant be sexy . its absolutely ridiculous  and completely insane.hell yeah. you go girl! put it down on these clowns.
older female characters from around the 90 s to let s say 2013 before the feminumpties tried to invade gaming were way way better. not just in design  but in character and depth. mgs had naomI who  whilst not playable  was still great. she was smart and didn t back down from the big grizzly dudes she was helping with for the mission they had  but then there s the queen of the action lara croft. the original destroys the new version. my knowledge on her is limited to only playing a few games  but from what I remember she was never phased by a bigger  stronger enemy  from big nasty men to big nasty bears  lions or even dinosaurs  in jungles and was just as adept at going to a formal event in a dress only to end up on top of a building in that dress taking back an artifact from a bad guy  vs the new lara who cries whenever she falls down a muddy embankment. that was my damn childhood for crap sake. she isn t a strong character.lastly  signing off with  go boom  how did you know I need to go to the bathroom    yes. Imade a poo joke.......Im sorry.
looks like the soy milk in kotaku s fridge went sour again...
blessed be your soul mel!! loving the Bible citations. as a catholic feels so good and so different to hear in between the analysis you give. keep preaching and God bless you always!
tomboy outback  we need more tomboys and muscle women in stuff...... let me go to horny jail.
of course this was written by a man I hope this doesnt come out wrong but for how much these people claim to care about the opinions and feelings of women maybe and just stick with me here cuz Im not the smartest person in the world but maybe they should get a woman s opinion on women in video games and maybe have a woman right out these opinions on women in video games
I for one personally love to see a hot confident and capable woman in my video games
love how steadily youre pumping out content for this channel keep it up
its why Ive ditched consoles altogether and invested in a gaming pc because on pc even if the developer caves in to the wokies  demands  there is usually a mod somewhere that will beautify the characters and make it a more enjoyable experience.
amen!!!
@melonie mac go boom  thank you.Imay not be a man of faith myself  but at the end of the day  isn t that what faith is all about  to trust that God will eventually sort out the sinners from the virtuous so there s really no need to impose beliefs on others  for any man or woman of religion.if God is what scripture says he is  then he ll know how to deal with each and everyone in a manner that is just in his eyes.
I d definitely choose Christianity over wokeness any time.
the old lara was not just a style icon back in the day  but she was a proper treasure hunter fighting off wild animals and the occasional baddie. today s lara is just a regular looking woman who thinks nothing of killing around 300 to 500 people per game like a total psycho.
thank you so much
if kotaku hates it  I will like it.
what a great video so refreshing  subbed
kotaku   players have pointed out... its a single tweet with 1  self -response and two likes... haha
psalm 91 is the my moms favorite verse.
the korean developers are ignoring american discussions.but I guess kotaku journos dont like that they do  its almost ad if kotaku feels thatsouth korea should accept more american cultural  imperialism
to be more specific  kotaku are scared of real women.
we  an isolated western community  had discussions about female representation and have decided that the rest of the world now sees things the same way we do.
grass isn t the only thing that guy has never touched.
lost ark is an awesome game btw.
protonmail isn t anything weird they re just a swiss privacy focus email provider I use them  you tend to find them more often in the tech world.
keep smiling and keep up that vibe!!!.....
reminds me of a story I read months ago complaining about representation in cyberpunk 2077  by someone who probably never even consumed cyberpunk content prior to the game
yeah they dont get it.  we dont seek entertainment to be schooled.  we seek entertainment to have fun.
put it this way  who are some of the most enduring female characters lara croft  tifa lockhart   jill valentine  how are they depicted designed
great channel and I love you content
I want to play as a overweight 50 something man. oh wait that is my real life I want to play as a buff barbarian that helps me escape my life for a few hours.
oh noes  kotaku is afraid of hot women again!- anyways...I never understand these people.healthy attractive men women in clearly fantastical power fantasy settings    baaadunholy flesh eating demons from the depths of hell in drab  modern cultural urologies    ohemgeee yaaas queen!! 100  from the perspective of an unholy fleash eating demon from the depths of hell myself  or a mortally challenged individual for those sorts of people... y all got your priorities hella skewed. time to start a lost ark account it looks!
I super love the hot women in lost ark
I would have played lost ark if I could have done my magic as a male I dont really have any interest in warriors nor do I really find interest in playing a female character but ill see what other classes come in the future game does look interesting.
glad jeremy sent me here. liking the new channel.
pinions  - the outer feathers of a bird s wing. includes the flight feathers...  often used in reference to God s promise of safety shelter protection.
final fantasy viI  one of the most popular rpgs ever   had aerith and tifa to cover both types of sexy. chrono trigger had 3 badass women and one of them was a nerdy tomboy  if Im not mistaken  who wore no revealing clothing. nobody complained about those gender stereotypes.
its a shame this game is not available on console.
lol who care about kotaku  thatsite has been brain dead for years.  lost ark is amazing.  also  Im not religious at all but I respect your beliefs  keep up the good content melonie
omg women skin  my pure eyes!!
if only they knew what we do to skyrim...
can we all pm kotaku with the yt channel info for mxr plays skyrim mods coverage   I can imagine heads exploding.
every women I played soulcalibur with systematically chose ivy.
future generations are going to look back on these times and see that we were out of our minds. I believe in americans to eventually always find a way to do right and I think we re seeing that in the push back to this craziness. in the meantime  we gotta baton down the hatches and call out the lunacy when we see it. who doesnt love the female form  there are tasteful and tasteless ways to do it but to erase it and make itshameful is pathetic and anti-pro-women. if I ever have a daughter I hope she feels beautiful in her own skin while appreciating the difference and nuisance in the world around her. just insanity.
its almost like some people dont understand what the word  fantasy  means
funny they never criticize giant ripped male characters
I think the perfect answer to woke people is the word  who   and the moment they wonder what do you mean  you simply complete the question with  who asked  . simple as that.   woke   sleepers I d say. nobody cares about their butthurt opinions. so annoying most of times.  but sometimes they can be funny ngl xd
my favorite tomboy! I need a tomboy in my life
me   plays skyrim as female wood elf every time. wife   why do you always play as a female wood elf me   if Im going to spend hours running around the game looking over my player s butt  thats what I d rather be seeing.wife   understood.
he s mad he cant get a confident woman for himself.
thank God we still have games like daoc n swtor
kotaku desperate to get all the hate from the internet one article at a time xd
I dont get it  these people are always like   dont like it  dont play watch it!    but theyre always playing games or watching shows or movies and constantly complaining until the creators buckle and submit to them. not everything has to cater to what you want.
I compare it to an artist canvas of paint. each color is unique and beautiful in their own way. working together these tools used effectively can create an amazing portrait. the woke agenda esg take on this  lets mix all the colors together into one grey blob  then start painting. that way everyone is happy.
we despise that which we are not. we envy that which we have not. we fear that which we know not.
from a female perspective the issue with lost ark is lack of variety tbh. say you   a friend play bard   mage. you both essentially get the same tiny dress throughout your leveling but slightly changed   recolored over and over. you   your friend look the same throughout your playthrough. the bottom armor is labeled  pants  but when you put it on its just underwear. high heels are your only option. there is no  two types of sexy  and its not like the classic rpgs. the article has some points it just needed to be better.
fans who play phantasy star online 2  ngs are complaining how there are not as many new cast customization parts available to obtain  cast is a robotic race in the game   and the developers explain how the majority of players prefer to play as human and elf women.
4 00 thanks for this. I get so tired of female characters being closet developedfor male players that want little screen waifus to stare at. and then these supposedjournos come along and force all this crap because they know it and they play themand some how we female gamers absolutely never enter the equation. they neveractually ask us anything. they might turn to their head shaved  progressive  female counterparts that are all bra burning purists  but us actual female gamersget shoved under a bus for wanting these things in our games. I want the outfits I want the customization. I dont want to be told I dont want these things andthat they are wrong. thats not representation. its repression. and itsure ashell isn t empowerment to take this away because of  male gaze .start making believable female characters with periods and stop gender lockingif you want to turn male players off them. give us actual romances seen throughour eyes not the male character s. and stop telling us what we can and cant haveand outright ignoring us when we straight up tell them what we want.its funny. the only reason Im not keen on playing lost ark is Im kinda done withevery girl I run in to and say hI to tries to score a date. cos its a dude hahaha.
Imean in some games you cna make like female trolls  undead and orks and stuff. we wont find anything about that on kotaku.
by their logic every male character should look like homer simpson.
kotaku is full of sheniquas and guess what they are always jealous of slim hot women
they re going to hate king of fighters 15 then.  the most female body appreciation game to come out recently and it will sell well because of it.  they made sure to add jiggle physics and thick booty shots.  especially shermie and luong.
in the psalm  the pinions refers to feathers on the wings. which God is sheltering you with.
I am a woman  I play video games... and I love playing a super hot  bad ass chick in skimpy  magically-imbued armor!
hey melonie. just heard by quartering what happened to you. now here s your time to build your own channel! at least I help you with a sub  and wish you go boom
these activist in gaming industry dont speak for me.
honestly I like playing a sexy female characters  its fun in mmorpgs and the gear looks better in my opinion. I want my character to kill dragons and win america s next top model at the same time.
I have witnessed my lady gamer friends literally say in multiplayer shooters  like apex   she s cute  I ll play her!  and  I dont want to play her she s ugly. just anecdotal but ... idk  I assume women are like guys in that way. guys like playing badasses like kratos because of the power fantasy. and women for their part get eye candy. lol its not a big deal
my guess is that proton mail guy is going to use a different email  from now on.
I couldn t even log on to lost ark due to the sheer amount of traffic for the game!as for doing things considered a sin... easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
the rest of the world is laughing at us for putting up with these perverts.
gendered classes is a cool idea  in my opinion. because it ll give the game a reason to replay and try different classes as a different gendered character than what youre used to. besides  not everyone plays a character with the same gender as them. plenty of men play female characters and plenty of women play male characters. its call a  role playing game  for a reason. I find itso funny how male feminists actually tend to silence female voices that dont fit their narrative. Ive been female and a gamer all my life and Ive played tons of different characters of different genders and its not offensive to me that the female characters are eye candy sometimes. I grew up playing lara croft games and I do miss her old design from time to time. it was sexy and fun and she was still a badass no matter how she dressed or acted. a women doesnt need to be plain or masculine looking to be useful or interesting.
not that it means anything but you just gained a follower.  God bless
hot woman talking about hot women!
another one out of the ballpark! here s an idea for the sjw crowd. make a fantasy game but you have to use your own pic for your face  enter your own weight height  they could sell scales with a camera that  record all this directly in game  and you cant do anything that you actually do. it would be a total flop...but they could cheer it on for being woke! it would also be a breeding ground for bullies. they need to let people build the games they want and let the people play the games they want. its pretty simple.
they want all the women to look like abby from the last of us 2
pinions are the underside feathers under a wing.
in regards to homosexuality  you share the same views as I do  and I am a Christian .  I feel that it is between them and God  since God is the one who passes the final judgement.  also  I have a hard enough time trying not to sin to worry about others sinning.
he s never touched grass before
I wonder if this is because games journo s are watching how american comics took such a buggery of an l from manga  and are like  oh  shit  if we let sexy media made by asians get made  this will be embarrasing for us
oh they are quality journalists
3 07  we in california declared this to be unacceptable  why do those koreans that live in a different country  with different attitudes  different cultures and different ideas of aesthetics not listen to us sounds like cultural imperialism to me.  this is unacceptable you savages  do what we say
in my opiniongirls likes aesthetic of thingswhen they play they nearly always try collect as much outfits as possible and showoffthey like it themselves  and tbh I dont mind too  p ofc  and I think if you bothed your game with ungly items and scenery  visuals  etc most guys will stay if the mechanics physics gameplay is good but you will lose right-away most  if not all girlsand there already are far too few  as it isbtw these smear-articels and hit-piecesmore and more everytime seems as advertising how great somthing  someone isI wasnt at all interested in lost arksaw it on steam beforenow it just make me look twice
huh . I kinda wanna try this now
dont worry. the  internet  has its own  unique way of dealing with  game journos . you can almost say we have  an unique set of skills    taken reference   p
you crack me up
our guild is literally 50 50 male and female. one of the things that appealed to our female demographic was how good they could make their characters look  we re fans of korean mmo s  and the eastern aesthetic. the journalist is actually silly. not only that but both male and female characters are like top tier attractive  so its not even one sided.I just... roflmao the guy is trying to be a social justice warrior for who exactly  kotaku banana heads.
asking if we are going to remember today s characters in 20 years  heck I dont even remember the characters from the darling of the game industry the best game of the millennia was a sequel that ripped out the heart of first game. even if the first character was kinda blegh. I barely remember the characters from most games after I turn them off lately.
happy tomboy tuesday     not only women would want to play  men would want to play too I think. this woke cancel culture is going to far and needs to stop!!! even religion has been pushed away from society!! you have a point on sexual orientation. God was against but Jesus Christ changed that. everything changed thru Christ and old law is no more but respect the 10 commandments which mention nothing of sexual orientation!! love your channel!!!
maybe zack wants to play more historical accurate games. ok zack  they re out there! buy them! hey  first person shooters are not my thing but Im not writing articles about it!
I love that psalm!!
they will sure be pissed when bayonetta 3  and project eve come out.it will only make me enjoy those games more.
what s really amusing these days is being a religious man and finding myself defending sexy video game women. it isn t that I think lewdness is great  or that men should expect real women to have these body shapes. rather  feminine beauty is one of the gifts of God. we should celebrate beauty  be it in nature or a woman. it represents the ideal we should all strive for  both topically and not. its a great thing  and not sexual. Im an electrician who works a lot in power plants and other industrial settings. when I get home  tired and dirty  seeing my wife all dolled up is great. seeing my daughters in cute dresses and smiling is preferable to the dirty stator I was in. beauty should be treasured  whatever form it is in.
nice! my wife s a tomboy!
the conversation around this is so frequently condescending to women. no one looks the hyper-masculine male characters with impossibly large muscles and screams about impossible body standards. if I can look at stupidly muscle-bound male characters without feelings of body dismorphia or being discriminated against  why would I assume that women would be so weak as to be offended or greatly affected by a hyper-feminized characters  these game generalists are just looking down their noses at the ladies.edit  fixing my awful grammar.
Ive played loads of fantasy games mainly from the east and I have never heard a player say the female chars are hot
10 20. when someone says  trust me   its such a big red flag  you can see it from space.  p
its funny how kotaku is bitching but the game has already blown through steam records of concurrent players lol
if I play as a guy  I want to play as a ripped  mean looking bastard that can rip people s heads off with his little finger.if I play as a woman  I want to kick ass and look damn good doing it.its not real. its a fantasy. its a frickin  video game!
good job
itseems as if the folks making this game just ignored the last decade or so of discussions and debates surrounding representation of women and non-masculine characters in games.   yes  kotaku  they did  and probably weren t even aware of such meaningless and niche  discussions   i.e. screeching on twitter and in poorly written articles .  why   1  the devs are korean and korea doesnt have the same level of woke bs the west does  nor will it likely ever have the same beauty standards2  even if they were aware of the  discussions   they would have chosen to ignore them because both attractive ladies and men sell a product.  and its a darn good thing they did too  because thats a big part of why la was one of the biggest mmo launches in recent years and easily flew past nw in terms of numbers of players.
kutaku   booooobs.....noooooo
I just realized.... there are no male characters with  dad bods .  I am so offended that us 50 year old white dads with a  paunch  are not represented in any of these games! !
kotaku is always scared of attractive women
lmao wasn t expecting my  silence  puritan  reply to show up on your channel.
always wondered where the twitterazI party got off on making cgI women  cartoons  and comics look weird  but dont care about portrayals of men that much. its an interesting racket though. how much uglier canthe protagonist of horizon whatever get
woot! tomboy tuesday!
am I the only one who thinks when women are portrayed as attractive they always look empowered  imposing  and revereable  sorry  but to me something like 2b is like the female version of conan the barbarian  the sheer confidence and strength that is exuded in every movement is just awe inspiring and makes you want to be better.ps  can I just ask  even if a God existed  and thinks homosexuality is a sin  why is that our problem  why do people give a shit about what God thinks  Ive genuinely never understood this.
...I dunno  cant we have hot female characters who also dress like the ass-kickers they are    because you can make heavy armor for female characters that is somewhere between  metal dental floss  and  lead-lined coffin   Ive seen it done.  six-inch stiletto heels is just asking for it.
how does kotaku make money too keep writers
oh Lord. someone ought to tell these ppl to go check out final fantasy xiv for maximum triggering and salt  much to our enjoyment . those outfits in lost ark look tame compared to what Ive seen ffxiv players wear.
when youre so far left that you end up right-winged.  how dare they show skin! the women need to be covered up!  lol
11 59 - one correction   do not think that I came to abolish the law or the prophets  I did not come to abolish but to fulfill it.  matthew 5 17carry on and God bless
you have the same view on sexuality that I have. I believe God thinks its a sin b c he wants us to reproduce. its the literally his instructions to adam and eve  dont eat that and go make babies  and to noah and his family  go forth and replenish the earth . other than that it is between people and God - nomb! I wish people would stop asking and I wish other people would refrain from anointing themselves as the sin police! we are all sinners  sans Christ  who is our only way to salvation. God bless you  sister!
perhaps somebody should gift the author a dictionary so they can look up the definition of the word  discussion
its a video game with fictional characters in a fictional universe. yes  the characters are exaggerated.kotaku  get over it.
laughs in topless boobalicious conan exiles
to your question  very good point! the answer is 2 things  1  because people who genuinely love God and believe in him as a person want to make him happy  just like you want to make your girlfriend happy. 2  because if we ignore God  and he does exist  he isn t gonna be happy  and so for some people its about not being punished.but for the record  the Bible doesnt say it is a sin to be gay or bi... it just says its a sin for 2 men to have sex with each other. anything beyond that  saying its wrong to be gay  saying girls cant have sex together  is just traditions from the old catholic church.
know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God  be not deceived  neither fornicators  nor idolaters  nor adulterers  nor effeminate  nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves  nor covetous  nor drunkards  nor revilers  nor extortioners  shall inherit the kingdom of God.and such were some of you  but ye are washed  but ye are sanctified  but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus  and by the spirit of our God.  - 1 corinthians 6 9-11 for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections  for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men  leaving the natural use of the woman  burned in their lust one toward another  men with men working that which is unseemly  and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  - romans 1 26-27
@aeric abison  ok  but why should I care about that
they want attractive women to cover up so it doesnt trigger others who dont bother with their looks  hygiene  diet  or clothing. they dont care if a bearded  woman  or transgender  plus size  person wears revealing outfits. just the attractive ones need to cover up because it encourages the  male gaze . they all need intense therapy.
Imentioned this in my video I uploaded today
who in world would want to cosplay plain renditions of video game characters  no one thats who!!!
the only time criticisms about realism are valid are for simulation sports games like madden and games  flight simulators.
this is how korean culture likes their games and music. Imean k-pop even has sexualized girls and femboys  so if anything this  journalists  is being racist for saying another culture s views are wrong and the koreans need to appropriate western ideals and views. lol the wrecking he got in the comments made me laugh to tears too melonie.
imo the obvious answer to women in chainmail bikinI is men in bottomless chaps or loincloths. people love attractive people and there s nothing wrong with that. throw in sensible armor for everyone and we all win.what Im trying to say is play monster hunter.
about the decide is to control us comment  agree 100 . I often wonder if the pronoun war is a tower of babel situation.
kotaku complains that amazon didn t censor the game enough.not even surprised anymore  I want the religious right from the 80 s back they were far less censorious.
here in the dirty south  you ain t a Christian if youre not wishing death to gays and attempt to burn women at the stake for wanting bodily autonomy. albeit  Im a pretty lousy Christian myself  but the one thing I seem to stump em with is asking them why they judge when thats God s job. our job is just to love one another while we re still breathing. apparently calling them out for using God as a scapegoat for their depravity makes them quite mad.
wussss uuuuup chicky!!! keep the videos coming!!!
for some reason after watching your video I wanted to go back to new world and see what the  ideal  female character creation looks like for them. oh my God I cant believe how horrendous it looks  I will say lost ark females look like closer to reality than this hot ass new world garbage.
kotaku is way too woke for me  I just want video game reviews  not all their thoughts on  social justice
I had not heard of this game before now  but if the sjw s are complaining about it then it might be worth checking out.
one of the most beautiful things God created  a beautiful girl talking about how our waifus need to stay hot and revealing. now all im missing is the sound of angels singing lol
fantasy is fantasy for a reason
Im a male feminist  but a sex-positive feminist. Im as sick as you are of them robbing female characters of their power by demonizing their sexuality and femininity. except I get called a sexist if I say any of the things you say. I come from comic books in the 90 s  when wonder woman herself still had a sexy costume. itsets up a dynamic where girls internalize the idea that they cant be both powerful and sexy  it has to be a spectrum with those concept at opposite ends.
on fallout 4 my women followers wears a american flag bikinI and a tactical operator helmet their main weapon is the m16 or the m60 machine gun thats how I play fallout 4 .
another based take. these journalism woke activists need to stay the fudge out of gaming! melonie  what is your take on sony censoring martha is dead
this new modern narrative that the opposite sex cant find each other attractive is absolutely fubar ! youre fit as  and get a certain crowd. the podgy science bird who talks about teslas has her crowd and hopefully never the twain shall meet
just subbed.   boom indeed.
they should just go and play horizon forbidden west.  Im sure they ll love the de-feminized monstrosity that aloy has become
Im a dude.  I enjoy sexy female protagonist in games
korean culture has been having huge social issues regarding women s rights especially the last few years   their beauty standards are so high that plastic surgery is given to people as gifts when they turn 18. suicides are becoming more   more common amongst k-pop idols   entertainers there too. not sure its a simple  thats how they like it  issue.
blasphemy against the holy spirit is one of the easiest sins to avoid committing  for me at least
I like sexy babes in video games. I like the old lara croft  she was iconic. now she s just a generic woman. imagine doing that to mario... just turning him into some guy with a moustache. Im really glad that the koreans and japanese pay little attention to what the wokies want  and still make attractive sexy characters. its escapism and fantasy... and thats what I want from my video games.
btw you should censor peoples email addresses in future videos so they dont get spam and such.
kotaku need to mind own business
there s no sin God cant forgive...except the sin you dont repent.living your life as though your sins aren t sins is a good way to end up in the wrong place.
4 19 - Im sorry zack  are you upset that the righteous defender of the people whose faith  skill and personal discipline is so great that he gains a superhuman physique and the ability to perform literal miracles is a man  youre right  you are boring.
those thread comments were too funny
I really dont understand all the fuzz about female characters in games  especially nowadays... I dont have a problem playing female characters. its nice to have the option. do I need super sexy characters all the time  no. do Imind it when its appropriate for the games overall design language  no. so what in my opinion  the unhinged inability to accept things one doesnt like  is a far bigger problem than sexy  long-legged women in bikinI armors...and if women dont like it because its so  sexist   explain the enormous female cosplay-community to me  no  anyone  thought so...are people nowadays incapable of accepting that everyone has different likes and dislikes its fiction! its imaginary! its creative freedom! just get a hold of yourselves... no one forces you to play those games if you dont like them...besides  you dont often here guys complaining about  impossible beauty standards  for men do you   ...omg this xyz  male  character is so muscular! totally impossible and offensive!  duh!  cringe...
protonmail is a mail that is used so it cant be traced back due to the way their servers works from my understanding
holy crap.  a Christian who doesnt hate everyone that isnt Christian   youre a damn unicorn.  love your content.
Jesus charged us to follow the teaching and examples of Christ  to be the most loving  caring  and devoted people we can be  it is not for us to judge. all souls will be judged by God  but the greatest sin is to reject God  so before youre judged for your sexuality  you ll be judged for your faithfulness or faithlessness.
if I were the developer I would add an option for a burka in response to this.
its interesting how the diversity of beliefs are only emphatically mentioned when used for leverage  specifically Christianity  or at least what many it perceive to be .if youre looking for an absolute answer as to whether or not same-sex relation is considered a sin the answer is  yes  in both the old and new testament . the issue is that its been overemphasized and misinterpreted as the generations emerge. its just as much of a sin as dishonesty  murder  theft and the rest of the detestable moral decisions that are rightfully affiliated with the term sin in that it falls under the description of adultery  romantic intimacy that is enacted in any way outside of the intended ordinances of a marriage  man   woman   and much more specifically  husband and wife. the marital signature is detailed in numerous occasions in the aforementioned ot and nt and is entirely contextually objective in nature. I understand that there are many who are genuinely curious about this and thought  as a believer  thatsomeone should give clarity to the seeming obscurity of this topic.here s a few scriptures for reference  and I encourage you to read the entire chapters and their surrounding for the full context  so God created man in his own image  in the image and likeness of God he created him  male and female he created them. and God blessed them  granting them certain authority  and said to them   be fruitful  multiply  and fill the earth  and subjugate it  putting it under your power   and rule over  dominate  the fish of the sea  the birds of the air  and every living thing that moves upon the earth. genesis 1 27 - 28 ampmarriage is to be held in honor among all  that is  regarded as something of great value   and the marriage bed undefiled  by immorality or by any sexual sin   for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.hebrews 13 4 ampnow we know  without any doubt  that the law is good  if one uses it lawfully and appropriately  understanding the fact that law is not enacted for the righteous person  the one in right standing with God   but for lawless and rebellious people  for the unGodly and sinful  for the irreverent and profane  for those who kill their fathers or mothers  for murderers  for sexually immoral persons  for homosexuals  for kidnappers and slave traders  for liars  for perjurers and for whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine  according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God  with which I have been entrusted.1 timothy 1 8 - 11 ampdo you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God  do not be deceived  neither the sexually immoral  nor idolaters  nor adulterers  nor  perversely  effeminate  nor homosexuals  nor thieves  nor the greedy  nor drunkards  nor revilers  whose words are used as weapons to abuse  insult  humiliate  intimidate  or slander   nor swindlers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God. and such were some of you  before you believed . but you were washed  by the atoning sacrifice of Christ   you were sanctified  set apart for God  and made holy   you were justified  declared free of guilt  in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the  holy  spirit of our God  the source of the believer s new life and changed behavior .1 corinthians 6 9 - 11 amprun away from sexual immorality  in any form  whether thought or behavior  whether visual or written . every other sin that a man commits is outside the body  but the one who is sexually immoral sins against his own body.1 corinthians 6 18 amp
its almost like they dont know what a mmo is
Jesus never abolished the old law. he reaffirmed and reinforced it.
12 00melanie.  yeshua  Jesus  did not abolish ha lacha.matthew 5 17-19 says that  I have not come to abolish the law  ha lacha  or the prophets  not come to abolish but uphold.  for I say unto you  until heaven and earth passes away  not one line or dot of the law shall be abolished from the law  until all is fulfilled .  direct translation from greek.not like the kjv which went from greek  to latin  to english  losing context.
pinions  the outer part of a bird s wing including the flight feathers.
the law of the old testament applies to us to 100 . the punishment is taken from us by yah-shua. all people who reject yahweh will be judged by the law of  the old testament  on judgement day  and the law is not abolished as most  Christians  think  but yah-shua fulfilled the law  so that the punishment eternal death can be removed from us by the faith in his sacrifice on the cross. the body is the temple of the ruach hakodesh  holy spirit   and we should not alter anything on our body  sorry  but the Bible tells us that  and I dont want to attack you . apostle paul tells us with authority given by the holy spirit who will inherit the kingdom of elohim and who will not. he she who does not stand up against abominations sins described all over the holy scriptures is against the most high and guilty of all those sins too. that is the standard of yahweh. you are either for the holyness of yahweh elohim or you are against him. I am openly against homosexuality transsexuality and other abominations yahweh will never accept  for he is holy  holy  holy. this doesnt mean that he hates those people  nor do I . no. he loves sinners! yah-shua came to this earth to set us free from the slavery of satan  the chieftain of this fallen world. yahweh loves the sinners but hates sin. he she who wants to commit those sins  mocking the most high  finding pleasure in those sins  when he she dies  he she will suffer eternal sepration from their creator  and yahweh doesnt want that to happen. what is to do  approach your creator yahweh in spirit  he is spirit  eternal  and not of physical nature  and in truth  he sees the truth  how things really are  and he cant be deceived   repent and move away from those sins. let you give a new spirit  a spirit not of this world but from our father in heaven. hallelu-yah  ! @melonie mac go boom  keep up your great work!
damn we cant really enjoy things these days huh  there ll always be someone who keep trying to push these kind of woke things.
I was rolling
glad you shared these verses. I hope more modern Christians take these into account without compromising their primary duty to love and accept everyone around them  just as Christ has accepted all of us. Christ doesnt not keep us sinners in sin  he sanctifies us through the scriptures and gives us authority to expose the darkness and shine his light so we can see our sins clearly.
he fulfilled itso we dont have to
Jesus fulfilled the law so we wouldn t have to. he did not come to abolish it as in be an adversary to it  but the law was fulfilled and we are no longer bound to it as a result. we are saved by grace.
let s be real. the Bible is one third apocryphal  one third history told by people who thought the earth was flat  and one third chinese whispers. and Im saying that as a Christian.
I need to play lost ark...
gaming journalists and male feminists beware!!! awesome and beautiful woman is  fighting back!!!
wonder what they think of girl x battles 2

remember  this is the people that calls you sexist
hey zack  I hope she sees this bro
hey melonie  do you know mike winger s channel  its got super Bible thinking  the discussions there are worthy.
I love u meeloniee
iron law of woke projection.  everything they accuse others of  they are doing to you.
call me b.c. aka the new dark shadow
all female characters should be text based. just describe them  we cant handle seeing them.
game journo was probably flirting with an all-female party  which turned out to be all male gamers.
a decade ago we had way better entertainment.
lmao dont tell kotaku about pso...
these tbey them make us 90s born gamers  feel like sith.......Lords .
just fyi. that would be  j c h one and only  14 06
just waiting for kotaku and polygon to go and shitpost feminist garbage on all instagram models   cause being hot is out of date now. Im honestly tired of arguing with soyboys and fuglies about hot female characters. Ive always loved them and always will. I can be a heterosexual woman and still appreciate attractive female characters... ugh!
this wasnt a problem in 2012.....  its only said ot be a problem in 2022 now by journalists.
girl youre super cute
the soy is strong with zak
everybody wants hot characters both male and female.
what song is that in the outro
proton mail is based in switzerland and is part of their vpn and secure services.
its because they re jealous. because they dont have any girlfriends to take to the prom
13 19 shirts vs skins etc etc.
how terrified of you they must be.

Im tired of running a search for the term  woke  in the user reviews on imdb prior to investing my time in watching something.
sisters and brothers by jerry garcia band uses psalms 91 its a killer song
oooh ok thanks!
yup

thats right! the mansplaining! how dare he!!!
out of date  really  if thats so how come the some of the most downloaded mods on nexus mods are ones where the woman are made to look sexier   have bigger boobs and wear skimpier clothing  please explain if the average gamer thinks thatstuff is out of date .
bam! boom!!!!!!
facts
soooooooooy sauce.
kotaku is so desperate to be relevant these days. and what are these discussions they re talking about  sounds like something they   similar fake  game journalists  from other outlets came up with privately in their own echo chambers  and now they re trying to craft a narrative to push onto normal gamers as some de facto truth of the industry at large.
everyone loves pretty women. c mon man
20 years ago we went to war over oil and weapons of mass destruction. today we are at war over pronouns  made up genders  and character designs in video games. times are so hard now.
do they walk up to people and say that to people who are dressed in revealing clothes noo they onl say it about games so they can complain about something and gain clout they never stfu and why is it a problem it doesnt make sense...there hypocrites
the run animation is just silly though.
beautiful  sexy feminine women  not in my game!!!
wokesplaining
I am too scared of attractive women so if you want to scar me  send hot women to me
because no hot women work there
article written by a man..... figured as much....
I have protonmail its just a  email service . dont worry about it
smokeeeeeee showwww
boom !
if they dont like it they dont have to play it  screw them.
I ll never understand who bitching online about video game character designs from some game is considered  journalism .
hateforprofitexposed sjw s have the most ironic account names.
because journalism clickbait... reporting reporting facts in an unbiased and morally grounded manner.
army brats unite! how many places did you see  7 for me 5 state side 2 over seas.
18k by the end of the week
kotaku destroyer of culture.
maybe because they never meet any actual woman...
if I wanted to play a game with ugly characters I would have picked up diablo two and played the william dafoe class.
a  man  wrote this.
let s be honest  strong women needs to be women just that.
maybe we really need a full dive  the ultimate next-gen full dive rpg is even shittier than real life!  kyuukyoku shinka shita full dive rpg ga genjitsu yorImo kusoge dattara   in real life lol.
they  hate anything that men might like plane and simple. that is why there is suck a big push for women that look like men. most men dont care for masculine looking women but women tend to be ok with fem looking boys so the get a pass. despite what modern feminist would have you believe women set the standards for fashion that is why doc for  sexy  cloths get so many downloads and generate so much money.
discuss the segment when sjws think exercise and weight measurement devices are considered fat shaming. show no mercy melonie!
hahahaahahahaah reeeee hqhahahahah!!
I prefer my women to look like men  thank you very much......... wait no
ok I will say this im not a fan of gender lock classes I do like playing has a female character but when im forced to play as one it takes the fun out of it and I cant stand isometric style as well
frumpy women is peak equality or something.
in my opinion gender lock is more for single player games  not fan of gender lock in mmo s  I like freedom of choice in mmo s  just my personal feeling about it  but whats the point to wine about it  no point at all  if u hate it dont play itsimple as thst
beerus the destroyer is going to hakaI the woke sickos
idk what kotaku is...sounds like more propag4nda tho
didn t the puritans want to clothe all women so nothing can be seen
this is the exact reason ... why now .. everything is a fking joke ... like you cant do .. or say anything without someone trying to be a white knight or find something negative to say ... for God sake ...  I should do one about the fack that the berserk project the idea of a big muscular man and badass and its the idealogy of what you should look like as a man ...   man ... seriously ...
hey mel I just want to tell you that I like the Bible verse that youread and I just want to tell you that it is a woman s body is God s creation and he made it to have a guy to be with   not to have for a slave and just to have for a God s purpose  ok. anyway I do hope you understand what I am trying to say to you bout this topic  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today at the gym   at home with your pets  ok mel.
air force brat here. born in hawaiI pretty much raised in japan.
@shandI nicole beard  I spent a year in okinawa was in u.s.m.c. at the time. this was after my dad retired of course.
@chris worth  we were stationed at yakota afb. my father was a pilot instructor and taught japanese pilots. I was rather young when we got stationed there and its were my mom passed away. pretty much was raised by my dad and older brother when my brother took a hardship and got assigned to the army base where he flew helicopters.
@shandI nicole beard  sorry to hear about your mom  I was at camp hansen  form 93 to 94 but I grew up in the military my dad did 21 years in the army retired as a sergeant major so I was able to see a great part of the world we live in. panama was my favorite with okinawa my second.
hopefully!

people act this way with the xenoblade series. have you heard of it
male feminist   the ultimate oxymoron game journalist   no talent hack
its all good just tell them that all the female characters are men identifying as female...
not sure why sjw s are scared of  heroic proportions  its silly to have issue with a cartoon
girls  do you want all the men in your games and movies to be fat and ugly  asking for a friend
if heaven is a place on earth... then so is hell. who s to say that the lgbt community dont already walk through hell. leave them be  only because they just want to live and let live  well the majority do  Im a white straight aethieat but am not bothered about others faiths or believes  because its important to each individual
when has kotaku ever been relevant anyway lmao.  they are a joke and always will be.
in the same context  you can only be forgiven if you accept Jesus....... not actively sin   be proud of it!yes we all sin but I actively try to better myself  not get lost in itso much that I can no longer see the light!
thats how you know the article was written by a male feminist.there s nothing impractical about heels. those things are fucking dangerous.
this is like todays modern male feminists decrying j scott campbell s  sexist  artwork. smh
all of those mainstream gaming sites are full of sjw s. its so tiresome.also  I wish lost ark was on consoles. I love dungeon crawlers.
youre doing this for fantasy right  who d want to play a game that reflected reality  why bother
american culture and american standards can stay in america and let the rest of the world do what we want to do and if they dont like it dont buy it dont play it dont watch it dont read it and so on and so on. and please stop blaming all men for what woke men are saying they are individuals and dont represent every man on this planet its like saying one feminist speak for all women. you are starting to go down the path of attacking men.
I just wanna say that I agree that this is a dumb article  but it isn t a  man  thing. Ive seen women share similar sentiments. they re both dumb  so let s not turn this into a man thing.
using the Lords name in vain  an is example is killing in Gods name  doing something to hurt someone using God as an excuse.
Im surprised they haven t cried about doa women  cammy  chun-lI  ivy  or any other fighting game females. or what about any of the metal gear franchise like quiet  eva or sniper wolf. silly soy flakes.
you know that its in the Bible old testament and new  but dont want to say it.this is a case of wanting to be everyones friend so youre lukewarm in your opinions.I d of rather you not answer that question than to answer in a way thatshows your shame of the Bible.
first
at one point men had heels on armour and royals loved heels as part of fashion.
@tarektechmarine  I ll casually roll in battle heels in pso on my buff  armoured male toons. they give your character that extra height lol!
@tarektechmarine  yep  itstarted as a practical invention to help keep the feet in stirrups for cavalry men.
I agree some women do it too usually not actual gamer women tho   but male feminists suck and I will take any opportunity I canto dunk on em
they were actually able to cry loud enough when sfv was released to change r. mika s critical art  aka super  so it doesnt show her ass when she slaps it.
@the konrad  they like to ruin everything they see.
Bible condemns homosexuality but as Christians we hate sin not the sinner or does it matter if someone is or isnt the real conversation to have is Gods kingdom and whether you accept God s invitation of it.. and making changes in your life please God is a personal journey so someone s sexuality is none of my business but doesnt mean God approves of it
south korea who made the game are having a lot of social issues with women being treated as second class   the beauty standards there are insane     I am in an all female gaming group   we noticed immediately we are forced to high heels only   the armors labeled  pants  aren t because its underwear when you put them on. armors aren t different or cool tbh. you gotta remember not every woman wants the over exaggerated characters like you too.
is anyone actually impressed by woke virtue signalling
lol...kotaku is still even a thing  those soy boI betas are irrelevant and out of touch. I love the graphics of lost arc....my female gunslinger has wiggles and moves that brings a smile to my face. if that makes me sexist  then so be it .
what a cop out take on the ghey sin stuff. saying God forgives all sin. thats like giving a free pass.   you can just do whatever you want like have one night stands and get tattoos and just tell yourself  well  God forgives your sins.. teehee.   explains why melanie has tattoos to begin with..  well at least she is trying and I give her credit but she is definitely no beacon of light or Christianity.. not even close.  to be fair she probably isn t trying to be.
Im old... but back in the 90s  I was young and I used to go to dance clubs and raves every weekend. and you know what  girls back then really looked and dressed like the girls in lost ark... super-short skirts  tiny dresses  high heels  long hair  slim  tall  stunningly beautiful... every weekend you d see dozens and dozens of girls like that. God  Imiss those those times so much.
@huxley _s  back in the 90s you also had women that didn t like dressing that way or going to clubs too though.    I have no problem with how women want to dress. I just think its a little hypocritical melonie advocates for sexy clothing like she s helping women when her comment section is full of mostly men backing her because they want to see half naked women. if you dont look like how these guys want they ll trash you   call you ugly.  even with your comment  thats clearly your fantasy but not all women want to fit your fantasy.
