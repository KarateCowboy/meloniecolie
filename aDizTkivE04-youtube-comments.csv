I think the lotr fandom standing so strong against rings of power is a testament to just how powerful the story is. speaking for myself  lotr is perhaps one of the most important stories Ive ever read  because it has very humble characters going up against extreme and even hopeless odds  and yet they tackle every obstacle without becoming jaded assholes or reverting to sugarcoating or plot contrivances. it is such a refreshing change of pace from all the deconstruction and politicking we see in modern stories  and it reaches you on a level so deeply that you know that what the story is telling you is true. and the fact that we are experiencing such a dark and hopeless time is making it more relevant than ever.
so  let me get this straight. people like anita can come in and criticize stuff they dont like all they want  but passionate fans aren t allowed a say on things they like  smells fishy to me.
been rewatching lotr extended cuts and all behind the scenes. the shear amount of passion that went into the creation has not been matched to this day.
I think this era has turned me from someone who completely avoided polital stances  stayed positive and continually accepted any changes in things that I liked  into a vocal and extremely critical person. there s been way too many obvious patterns happening to not wake up to see the same bs. its not just you  we re all starting to smell the bag of shit these people leave on our doorstep.
the thing with Lord of the rings is  their hardcore fans are truly schoolars. they know their stuff  are passionate about it  and will he highly critical of how the ip is portraited anywhere.call me old fashion  despite technically being gen z  but I dont like that  participation prize  kind of thinking we have nowadays. cant make a piece of criticism or say you dont like something without hurting someone s feelings  and that ends the same way when you shelter your kids too much. anything is a reason to cry.its also why some game companies and film makers and comics publishers are so out of touch with the fanbase. nobody is allowed to criticize  so you dont get that feedback to improve  or change how you do things. what s worse  they wave the ist phobe bat over your head if you dont like it  to further whatever narrative they re trying to push.and thats how you alienate your audience. awesome content  melonie  feels nice to see someone with the same values getting a good message out there.
I dont like video games. I dont play video games. I dont know anything about video games.  - anita sarkeesian approximately 6 months before declaring herself the gatekeeper of video games.
I have always been a staunch believer in gatekeeping. I lived through the era of many of my hobbies and interests being ruined by woke culture. comics  video games  movies  comedy... the list goes on and on.
the reason the peter jackson films are so acclaimed is the fact that the team behind them simply said  we went into this not wanting to put our own ideas and beliefs into the work  we wanted his to show. in a way we were making it for him  tolkien   this is how people adapting the works of others should behave. do not do what amazon and the one ring dot net is and has been doing. very bad form  very very bad form.
excellent vod  mel! you are right  we truly do need to gatekeep the things we love now because of these wokies. we invited these woke crybullies into our video game and anime spaces and now we are suffering the consequences. guarantee those woke crybullies we invited in are also the people who bullied us for being gamers and weebs in the first place  food for thought.
these individuals aren t fans of the lotr franchise. seeing as though I got into tolkien s work after watching the peter jackson films. I dont need to see myself on screen to identify with a character. lol
touching back on the female characters  I d argue that classic lara having selfish motivation is more realistic in terms of thats how a majority of people operate in real life. at least in my life experiences anyway people are really just looking out for themselves. I tend to go out of my way for other people but Im also guilty of this occasionally  and Ive been screwed over by others plenty of times when they were looking out for themselves.as far as modern female characters go  there have been some good ones that Ive experienced over the past few years  not that watered down politically correct whatever. the second sister in fallen order comes to mind as a great villain. she spends about 98  of the game being just evil  I wont spoil the end for those that haven t played. pretty much all of the major female characters in witcher 3 were complex   nuanced. all of the sorceresses were manipulative   had ulterior motives. even yen   triss weren t quite on the up   up all the time. cirI was the only truly  good  female but she still had her moments of conflict.
glad to see you come around to gatekeeping. as someone who is writing a novel  creating music  etc. I would want people to gatekeep my work. its what eric july would want with the rippaverse. its up to the fans to protect art. gatekeeping keeps that art alive  much like a natural immune system.
cat at 0 24  she s talking to the wall again. I ll go find a toy.
hey  mel! just finished watching the extended versions of original lotr...... they dwarf the theatrical releases  and still hold the test of time. much better than hobbit ones and whatever this new abomination amazon is planning to present.
the whole  blah blah blah hate in our fandom  thing is just a fallacy. they act like thats just the end of the debate and they wonthe argument while not actually having a rebuttle or good point to make.
those people who run the  fansite  are a complete joke and are a bunch of hypocrites. they complain that j.r.r tolkien is racist even tho the characters are clearly defined and are based in european culture. they crap on the fans for being loyal and faithful to the lore and ridicule youtubers for monetizing the content on the subject even tho theonering got caught in 4k kissing the corporate mule that is amazon for monetization for their youtube channel. they are the one and only ring that needs to melt away into obscurity and classify themselves obsolete.
on the issue of gatekeeping  raz rfist made a video a couple years back about the  metal community   where a few female  metalheads  complained that  whenever they arrived at a concert wearing a band-shirt  they were automatically quizzed in the spirit of  name three songs of that band! . nothing new to anyone in the  community   male or female  but back then I thought it was kind of unnecessary to so overly  well  gatekeep. fast forward to the fnt episode where melonie was on  where they were talking about that dudes  as a rule  tend to just riff on each other. you know  just to see if you cantake a punch a be a good fit for the group. it occurred to me  then  that this is pretty much the function of what  gatekeeping  in fandoms etc. actually is. most of the time it is not mean spirited  its just testing if you can hang  aka belong within the group  or a if you aren t a good fit  a poser or what have you . it is not exclusory per se  only insofar as it tests your compatibility with the group and as such if you d be a hazard to it or not. everybody does this in their private life. men  women  no exceptions.  I know those are a lot of words for such a rather simple observation  but it really shows that gatekeeping  as it has always been practiced  in every social group whatsoever   is fundamentally a healthy practice. most communities accused of  toxic gatekeeping  atm are just predominantly male  and such use the  banter method  so common among males. and if you fail to adapt to the way a group gatekeeps  you wont adapt to the group proper. as such  gatekeeping is overwhelmingly viewed as negative just by those unable to adapt to the group or who never wanted to in the first place.sorry for the rant... great vid btw   tl dr  gatekeep the s  out of every fandom!
fantastic video melonie! its good to see someone who is openly Christian. I was honestly surprised that you fid a Bible quote at the end of some of your videos and I find it refreshing. I found you through fnt and now think youre one of my new favorites. the thing you said at the end also about being honest no matter what is so true I use to be one of those people who lied because I wanted people to think I was cool or had a better life but I eventually grew up and realized honesty is truly the best policy even when it might hurt someone in the short term its better in the long term.
hey melonie  recent subscriber here!  caught you on friday night tights!  to my surprise  youre not only beautiful but a gamer with values Christian !  also  youre a carnivore!  Ive been on keto carnivore for 2 years now and its the best thing Ive done for my life!  it looks like youre are also thriving on being carnivore  thought you were in your early 20s  you look great for your age  this is what carnivore does!  if only the majority of ppl could know the real truth!  doctors have been lying for decades  they want you sickly to get those expensive pills   appointments!  anyways  Im enjoying your content!  keep it up!
Ive never been a rings fan  but I am so pleased to see the fans defend against these disingenuous actors
I think this time they fucked with wrong fans
and can make truck loads of money. but God forbid fans happen to make money while discussing what they are passionate about.
@nightwishfan1991Â  given truckloads of money. she didn t earn it.
yes. thats what hypocrites do.
all the written middle-earth works by jrr tolkien and his son have an unprecedented level of complexity that has never been seen since  truly incredible. hopefully we wont allow amazon s series to ruin the works for us. I personally wont watch it
I have watched the making of the lotr movies more times than the films themselves  as you say the passion that went into every element of the film adaptation is truly incredible.
the only movie that might rival the passion put into it was gettysburg. those extras brought their own shit  uniforms  cannons  guns  etc etc  and basically told the producer that he better stick to the facts of the battle instead of just  south bad  north good  that hollywood likes to take all the nuances out of. if what I remember is true  then most of the extras didn t even get paid  Imight be wrong here so if you know then please correct me

this gen z also agrees.
the grifter that high jacked it really.
you  sound like me lmao
@darkness flame mediaÂ  which female  and not that they said ideas and beliefs. they said nothing about not adding story appropriate things to the plot.
@darkness flame mediaÂ  you mean arwen in place of glorfindel  yes because movies need a love story. I personally liked that change. its an adaptation and a masterpiece. btw arwen is in the appendi.  you cannot even name the character so be gone.
that female . do you mean arwen  she was not an invented character the story of arwen and aragorn iI could have been a movie in itself just from the appendix. this was not an invented love story and gave depth to aragorns character
I totally agree  bad form indeed.
touching the back on female characters is what I do!
@grasslanderÂ  not exactly what Imeant by that phrase but lol regardless.
females with ulterior motives   ...nah the joke is too obvious  hehe  though such characters are everywhere in all sorts of franchises  we can even find them in lotr  ungoliant  shelob  queen beruthiel    even the story of queen ber thiel does exist  however  if only in a very  primitive  outline  in one part illegible. she was the nefarious  solitary  and loveless wife of tarannon  twelfth king of gondor  third age 830-913  and first of the  ship-kings   who took the crown in the name of falastur  Lord of the coasts   and was the first childless king  the Lord of the rings  appendix a  I  iI and iv . ber thiel lived in the king s house in osgiliath  hating the sounds and smells of the sea and the house that tarannon built below pelargir  upon arches whose feet stood deep in the wide waters of ethir anduin   she hated all making  all colours and elaborate adornment  wearing only black and silver and living in bare chambers  and the gardens of the house in osgiliath were filled with tormented sculptures beneath cypresses and yews. she had nine black cats and one white  her slaves  with whom she conversed  or read their memories  setting them to discover all the dark secrets of gondor  so thatshe knew those things  that men wish most to keep hidden   setting the white cat to spy upon the black  and tormenting them. no man in gondor dared touch them  all were afraid of them  and cursed when they saw them pass. what follows is almost wholly illegible in the unique manuscript  except to the ending  which states that her name was erased from the book of the kings   but the memory of men is not wholly shut in books  and the cats of queen ber thiel never passed wholly out of men s speech 1   and that king tarannon had her set on a ship alone with her cats and set adrift on the sea before a north wind. the ship was last seen flying past umbar under a sickle moon  with a cat at the masthead and another as a figure-head on the prow. unfinished tales  part 4  ch 2  the istarI  notes  note 7jokes aside  characters are complex  ambiguous  various characters have various motivations  goals  experiences etc. witcher is indeed one of the examples of franchise where female characters like the sorceresses are very nuanced  but most characters in that universe are manipulative  all those who are influential and powerful  poltiically minded etc. thats the feature of thatstory  witcher often deals with political intrigue and temperamental sorceresses are at the core   . there are few characters in witcher that would be marked as  pure  or truly  good   that is also part of the so called  grey morality  of the setting. witcher books and video games that are most likely the best adaptation so far  even though the games are actually unofficial sequels to books   are part of that  darker grittier  fantasy setting  witcher definitely in this regard rivals a song of ice and fire  and funnily enough the first witcher stories were published even before martin s book game of thrones came out    .
@fantasywindÂ  thanks for the in depth breakdown  though it was a bit unnecessary. my original comment was simply highlighting examples of female characters in modern video game properties that dont fit the woke narrative that certain devs are pushing in the industry.
screenshotting and saving this. excellent summation.
wtf would guys gatekeep women out of the metal community I would frantically usher women into it and shutdown any attempt at gatekeeping if I could. from my experience itseemed like there was a pretty healthy amount of women at the shows I went to. I really never thought to ask the girl rowing next to me how many amon amarth song titles she knew.
@sevexÂ  the point is that the larger issue is completely divorced form being female  or having any other biological trait  so to speak . that is just the false perception form the outside looking in. from the inside looking out  it is a matter of character. everybody gets treated the same  there are just people on the outside that cant handle it  in my initial example  them coincidently being female . if the girl or guy next to you rows to the music  enjoying the show and having fun like the rest of the pack  thats awesome  they clearly belong. the problem arrives with people that evidently dislike the environment in the first place and need the community and art to adapt to their sensibilities  once they enter  album covers need to change  lyrics have to be less  xyz-ist   no  mean  banter. which is what happened to comics  games  movies  you name it. hence  gatekeeping is necessary if you want to keep the integrity of a community fandom.in my opinion  at least. subject open to discussion    edited for clarification
@theneongentlemanÂ I think what Im misunderstanding is that to me gatekeeping is more like a barrier to entry  which would likely be prejudiced  as opposed to a loose knit community disapproving of those that break unwritten rules. I think it would make sense that people would be asking the mean questions only after they ve witnessed some kind of behavior to warrant it. man now Im reflecting hard on my experiences  .
something about melonie just cant help but make ya smile
the problem with those that makes changes to existing properties that we all find so odious  they hate the properties themselves  and the fans of those properties.  so  they seek to ruin what the fans like out of envy  spite and resentment  because those that ruin things are unimaginative and talentless.  never were there more truer words spoken then by tolkien himself   evil cannot create  it can only corrupt and destroy that which has been made by the forces of good
regarding female villains  faora-ul in man of steel was the way to go  she was proud of her strength and her ability to bypass morals and the like. she outright states this to kal-el clark.ursa was the same in the original. completely unrepentant and very comfortable with being what she was. these were women who weren t going to be swayed by appealing to their better natures  as they didn t have any.both proper femme fatales - beautiful and deadly!as for gate keeping  Im a star wars fan  been one since going to watch the original when it was released in 1977. my franchise doesnt really exist anymore  not the one I fell in love with anyway  so I say this to you lotr fans  guard your treasure with everything you can muster  because if you dont  they will take everything of value and leave you with a dry  hollowed out corpse when they are done.
to be fair  I low key deserved being snickered at because I used to run around the school field  pretending I was a character in everquest ......I even used to sit in the middle of the field to pretend I was  camping   logging out
looks like  policy wise  we re still seeing an uphill battle against disney until they lose enough money to start caring about it. Im boycotting moon knight right now in response to some personal politics between me and the dnc but feel free to let me know how it goes. good analysis.
even within the  alitaarmy fandom Im in  there is one fan that loves classic lara where I love all of them  leaning towards reboot lara. but we accept and get along with each other  just as I followed melonie for her far more positive attitude and zero gatekeeping. at least the silver lining is that you cantell which group of fans are worth hanging out with and getting to know or which content creators to follow.that and I d much rather spend energy on what I love than waste it on things I dont like. simply not worth it.
holy moly! randomly come here after watching a drinker video and then I got a Bible study! thank you! really .. thank you! also a point on talking about old gamers. Im a pretty  og  gamer I think ... considering my first games were played on the tsr 80 loaded with a .. ahem cassette and mostly text  zork  or awesome graphics with asciI characters. I remember over the decades having to hide my hobbies. reading fantasy and science fiction  watching anime from all the nasty  cool  people bullies out there. when you were talking about that it kinda struck me that all that has happened is that thode original bullies have merely appropriated our hobby. big corp found an area to make good money and made the hobby popular so they could make money and the popular people have brought their toxicity into our beloved hobbies. dunno if that makes any sense and I dont really know what the point is ... but ... how do we fight back with our dollars to make big corp support the original lovers of our hobbies  how do we oust these gamer cultural apporpriators  real word   p  from our good times
mel keep up the good content and always thrive further and dont let the woke mob ruin your life and dont take the internet too seriously would love to see you on fnt again!
Imiss the concept of the evil sorceress witch wicked queen. nothing was more satisfyingly than the end of the game ico  where the boy who started off in a really bad spot  and had the whole world against him  picks up the sword  and slays the evil queen  to free the only person in the world who appreciated him  the girl  yorda.
you keep speaking the truth melonie.
I love your videos melanie! youre the best
keep monetising it... we ve watched some of the team discuss lotr with the passion and knowledge of fans.its those shills that are selling out.
one ring dot net  mercy please ..me  there is no mercy!
gatekeep so the orcs and goblins cant defile the things we love.
here s the thing.we ve been told to like a lot of things.we were told to love ren.we were told to love a female dr who.we were told to love discovery.we were told to love....well  how can I say....marvel   captain marvel ....    and now  we are being told to sell out the father  the beloved  the foundation of it all.the man who wrote stories because there weren t enough stories to read. the man who wrote backstories for a barrel of longbottom weed.the man who captured generations...decades....generations of readers  who created high fantasy  who built arda........we dont wont tolkien turn into ren.  ....or into a female token-ization....or into discovery.we love middle-earth because its middle-earth  not because youre trying to write bs that tolkien never wrote.we know what we like and what we want  and that  apparently  is something amazon knows nothing about.
you will accept the new direction of this ip  you will be happy  and you will attack anybody who says anything that criticizes it!  -the internet  2022
it is possible to give a critique on something that has hardcore fans without making it an attack.  the first sonic movie is a perfect example of that.  the early trailers made it not look like sonic at all  and the fans pointed that out.  so they went back to the proverbial drawing board and tried again  and they nailed it.  there s no doubt responding to that feedback was profitable for the producers.  if people would just listen to the fans  everyone would be better off.
there may come a time when the works of tolkien come crashing down but its not this day!
the tweet before that one was a gem too although it didnt get as much attention  they tried to say gary  nerdrotic  had never said anything about what he loves about lotr.gary.the single person who is soley responsible for most people even knowing thatsite even existed.the guy who often spoke speaks about the good times he used to have on their forums.lol.
thank you for your perspective melonie !
its her positive energy.
Im into lotr  warhams and d d  and even Im overcome with the urge to scream  neeeeerd!!!
@harbl99Â  I accept this proudly  I also have a whole wall in my new apartment designated for star wars  and another designated to cool art puzzles I glued to display awesome fairy dragon art. come at me homer simpson  I love that meme but yeah  this is why I was snickered at. Im not even sorry
there be no shelter here!
agreed and perfect description of the orcas and goblins
I guarantee that you ve never read a single word written by tolkien.
@ryan cruzÂ  do me a favor make like melkor s modesty and get lost.
@ryan cruzÂ  I guarantee you ve never   understood  any of tolkiens writings
on a related note   gee  I wonder what we re gonna talk about on fnt in a little while...  ahhhahaahahahah
its refreshing to see content creator adding Bible verses towards the end. nice video and God bless you.
gate keeping is more easy when its a single player game  you can form your own community and keep the not like minded people out  but when it comes to multiplayers its not so easy anymore because gaming companies dont give us the use of dedicated servers anymore  in the early days we could host games with our own dedicated little server at home or hired servers we could setup thru configuration.we could keep out the cheaters and or the trolls etc.
if creators need to demonitize to prove their fandom  then amazon needs to demonotize to prove theirs.
I loved the original kong vs Godzilla I dont care that the kong suit looks like it was found flattened on the side of the road it just adds to the charm of it.
when I was really into the silmarillion  there wasnt a lot of art for it on the internet  oh about 12 years agonow there are endless interations of morgothxsauron ships  with sauron decidedly a trap.
that nes controller hat is awesome!
great video.  love the hat too!  the controller made me think of good ol konamI code  d
never forget torn tried to lie   say fans were against ian mckellen being gandalf because he was gay then proceeded to block gay people who called them out on there lie   even ian himself scolded them for using him.
remember the good ol  days when you gave an opinion about something and someone didn t tear you apart for it  sigh.
gatekeeping is nothing more than protecting the things and people you love. always remember that we are gatekeeping people who think orcs are black people. they have already broken down the gates so we must be the guards of the citadel.
I just wish that the rest of tolkien s family would ve been as stingy as Christopher was with the rights to the series  it really sucks that this garbage will be some people s first experience with it.
melonie looking like a pokemon trainer this vid  I approve
I used to be one of those people who were primarily self interested  would lie  cheat  steal to get ahead  etc.even through all those years  the holy spirit was there in the back of my head gently reminding me that what I was doing and how I was living my life was wrong. even after 3 years in state prison  I continued to live selfishly for a long time  ignoring what I was hearing in church  in Christian music like skillet and demon hunter  etc.eventually  though  those seeds began to sprout and I have spent the last few years trying to live a more Godly life. its not easy  but I feel more fulfilled and more at peace now than I did before.
stopping destruction and political undermining is not gatekeeping  its protection.they re welcome to the fandom  provided they do nothing to ruin the thing we re a fan of.the proper term is  exclusivity  and they re excluded.
I hope critical drinker gets a few more subs from this.
hey melonie  I just saw your tweet about aliens. it made me laugh  but I was wondering  what s your deal with them   0  also  I love your hat.
on behalf of many of your cultured viewers I would like to thank you for showing a little bit of midriff in this video. its not really the reason we watch your videos but its a pleasant bonus
the tomb raider reboot trilogy  were my favorites in the series lol I do like the ps3 collection though of underworld and legend but I always keep going to the reboot trilogy.
you are making excellent points
it all relates to tomb raider and lara croft
they dont care they just want a check. so fucking sad
he s my favorite along with just some guy and nerdrotic.
malonie the cheerful melody
its all about marketing. some people and companies are so charismatic that they make you think they are being nice and kind to you just because of you or your content but really they just want exposure for their game  show  book  music  whatever.
lol they wanna challenge the  haters  to show their true fans that love the story @just some guy will straight call you out in elvish !bruh...bruh...unless you can argue back in elvish I dont think you get to call the man out on his fandom.
Im crushing on you so bad  haha. its great that I found you right as I was getting back into the church. makes me feel better about the choice. God bless.
gatekeeping is sometimes needed
the game of life isn t fun if youre playing it on easy mode with cheats enabled.   when you live life with integrity  you will face challenges  evil will test you- be the game tester  you control this game  never allow evil to tell you how to play it.
something to keep in mind...your home isn t here in this world  and whatever you have  you will loose  even down to your own phsysical body. with this in mind  those without a conscience or a shred of guilt  this is all they have  and its really sad when you think about it  because the only person that will ever be important to them is themselves. life was never meant to be traveled alone  or without the company of others  because those who do so are either an animal  or a God  and I assure you right now...even if their most drug-fueled dreams  they re no God.
not so easy for anyone.  sarkeesian has a master s degree in social and political thought.
amazon is the one ring.  one amazon to rule them all   you shall not pass!!!!!
its an attempt to control pre-existing awareness and consumption of media brands. people build free content and awareness in a brand  story  movie series over years. its bought up and messaged  or a poor copy is made full of content that is not supported by the original media  and changes the mood  art  and story. then they dont listen to the targeted community and make some socially driven choices  or emotion-based personal reconceptions of the media thatstand because of ip rights and business relations inside large companies.I bring as an example of this the many art content pictures of min farshaw from wheel of time that exist on the internet. in all the character art  she kind of resembles kitty pride  or a young pirate girl  someone like rey from force awakens. but go to the series  and the actress looks nothing like the 100 s of pictures created that represent her  as people imagined her based on the book descriptions. this incongruity is stark. the root of a lot of people is the opposite of the square.
believe me when I say there is no fandom more vile than the final fantasy seven remake shippers. the fact that I wasn t happy with the direction that they re taking that  that in fact its a reboot and remake  yeah that has got me fillet like a fish. thatsquare has decided that a small handful of shippers on twitter is more important than the fans of the original makes me more than a little angry  but damn those people are vile!
I ll be honest as much I love all the Godzilla movies Imuch prefer the new  Godzilla vs kong  film over the original 1962 film. now granted it is a fun movie to watch and its much more cheesy compared to the 2021  but thats just me . but there is one thing I ll give to the original film over the new one and thats it has a better soundtrack.
I love the kitty cat!
about the gatekeeping comment  it wasn t games that needed to gatekeep. the activists  lets call them what they are  took over the game dev industry. toxic positivity is a great way to put how they behave.
try and criticize anything  even something small  about star trek  on reddit  and feel the wrath come down. fandoms are corpo controlled now. the  fans  now defend the corpos and anything they say. its super cringe.
they will take your hobby or fandom  kill it  skin it  and wear like a pelt while saying it was always theirs. I think thats a micheal malice quote  forget where I heard it  probably also messing up the quote.
2 56looks like resetera  kotaku  gizmodo  polygon  and a bunch of others are going to have to shut down then.
- first language   drooling - second language  english - third language  drooling with an eastern european accent.thank you for the video.   3
I can accept the first tomb raider reboot as tomb raider in a lara begins kinda way. like casino royale its a how did she become lara.. then they kept going however
oh and yes I enjoyed it !
shippers are some of the worst type of fans out there
is square enix ever gonna even release the rest  video games are dying. its sad.
try defending ulfric stormcloak on reddit. they love imperialism for some reason there  lol.
not trying to be a prick  then again I rarely have to try  if you ve got the free time to run a fansite and community you ll probably be a bit more susceptible to the concept of taking money for no effort. not to bag on the fans but also kinda bagging on the fanatics.
to think people on the one ring were kicking off about the tiniest changes in the peter jackson films back in the day... trouble is  tolkien s grandchildren  now that Christopher is dead  have a stake in amazon s series and the likes of the one ring evidently feel they have to fall in line. its very sad.
speaking of hobbies being hijacked  dare I say  d d. Ive been playing it for over 30 years. I know I will get hate but  Im tired of hearing if I dont include all things woke Im just the worst person to play d d.  I was hated on for playing it  now Im hated on because of the way I play it
love the channel love your voice. what happened to the fish tank
they wanna leech off the fan base but get upset when the fan base dont like it then say its not made for you.... the fan base you try to sell this product off to -_-
I dare you to demonetize your content!!!    this is basically them saying  we cant make any money so you shouldn t be able to either.    here s a surprise   you can speak the truth  be entertaining  make money and also have it be negative against something...  all at the same time.
we are commanded to forgive  so I forgive their trespasses. however  I am not commanded to forget those trespasses. as they sow  so shall they reap. as they rip  so shall they sew.
great video melon
every fandom got its defenders and haters. Im part of many fandoms  but one of the most toxic is Lord of the rings and star wars. the owners of each ip dont care about fans expatiations and mainly higher writers that fit there visions.
I have a job where I have a lot of contact with people. way more than I would like to. and you have no idea how many people  live the  easy mode  life described here. I had people lie to me about stuff I said because they were to stupid to figure out they are lying about me to me...
that was a unique transition  from talking about the fiction and character dispositions  then to the Bible verse. but  this is somewhat at the heart of the issues. part of the reason Christian movies and shows fall flat is because the people that produce them have a particular zeal for the moral good that its difficult to make a bad guy without the moral zeal feeling bad about making a character do bad things. or the good guy is like a moral mary sue that has no moral flaws whatsoever. to make characters dynamic  you have to balance out their pros and cons  both what s good and what s bad about them. after all  in God s story  satan was once an angel of light  a seraphim in one of the highest choirs of angels. milton had an interesting take in paradise lost  while also through his fictional interpretation making a critique of the revolutions of his time. in thatsame vein  our fiction ought to also be able to critique our contemporary society as well. we shouldn t just be referencing 1986  but writing the books  making the movies and games that push back against the woke and cancel culture. we did this in the 90 s when certain groups were trying to censor violence in video games. and yet game franchises from that time  between tomb raider and mortal kombat  have become woke themselves. why is there a difference between a Christian conservative grass roots groups trying to censor blood and guts  but its alright to bow down to the woke mafia and censor fictional characters  with an athletic  attractive build with nice boobs and curvy hips  the fundamentalists that became overzealous puritans were no better than the overzealous puritan woke folk today.  thus why one has to be careful of the left and the right  the pharisees and the saduccees. for both can be like wolves in sheep s clothing.
I liked moon knight... until the ending  when he started to take a backseat in his own series.
thank you!
its always so nice to see your gorgeous self
melody is probably autocorrect in action.
I like your video s and the Bible talk at the end. no shame in loving Christ. confess him before men he says he will confess you to his father. the just shall live by faith is my go to. stay boomin
you monetize your content  so you obviously dont actually love lotr! stupid argument. smart people monetize the things they love. thats why the expression  do what you love  exists. enjoying what you do for a living is a good thing.
haters  they butchered wheel of time. they turned it into wheel of woke. prme track record sets the stage for what the lotr series will be.
sometimes I dont know which is worse  being woke or spineless to certain platforms
dear melonie  its rightfully called  the wrongs of power   -
I never had a fish tank  that was a gerbil terrarium lol. Imoved it to another room a few months ago  my elderly gerbils are somehow still alive
they ll sew a sweater
@sunny archipelagoÂ  its the first of april you fool. women like anita sarkeesian dont know how to sew. or cook. thats why I do the roasting
partly its balkanization of entertainment. bells of saint mary s and lilies of the field were two decades apart  and were extremely mainstream movies with overt religious themes but broadly accessible stories. if someone makes a movie with that kind of tone today its either hallmark channel  and thus dumbed down  or its being marketed to a post-religion wealthy audience that is looking for something more topical.
@joseph fisherÂ  - true  I remember watching bells of saint mary s. its definitely a classic  and a movie of its time. its certainly not a movie that could be done today because a lot of it is reference of a bygone day s culture. and yeah  I saw a hallmark channel movie try to do a movie like it  but it came off as trying to modernize the catholic church at a time when traditionalism was becoming a thing  not among the church hierarchy  but among church goers that have felt the church has been watered down by so-called modernization. it might have worked with some protestants who are more likely to embrace a more modern worship service  because they are not so interested in tradition  or at least in the concept that a catholic might have. albeit  that depends on the type of protestant  as you do have mainline churches  like certain lutherans  or episcopal anglicanthat are sometimes labeled  almost catholic   or refer to themselves as old catholic  who may be more sympathetic to tradition.  but  back to entertainment  yes  a movie like bells of st. mary s today would be either a light hearted hallmark  or a religious cult movie classic  and either way a niche genre. then again  a mary poppins musical style movie would be niche at the moment  too. cats and les mis are the last few in thatsort of genre  and to say mixed reviews as of late is quite charitable. the 2004 phantom of the opera was about the last to have relatively warm reviews.
gaming passed movies for annual revenue a while back  now that corporate    is in gaming quality has gone down and has to appeal the broadest audience - lowest common denominator.  imo!
I cannot agree anymore! I hate that we cannot constructively criticize anything anymore because then we are  bigots   or something else thats not politically correct any longer . Im a fan of you melanie mac  youre one of the few genuine human beings left here. Im an old fuck  I liked the times when we could say what we wanted without risking to be canceled for the smallest  thing ever.
quartering gender swap
though I like the hat  love both the nes and mythical nintendo famicom  youre too pretty for a hat  too nice of hair. no simpo.
jrr
though Godzilla films are entertaining  I still prefer when Godzilla is lone and apocalyptic. shin g jira is the best Godzilla since the 1954 g jira.
I feel the same way when it comes to assassin s creed. now the traditionals are haters because they want the franchise to stay connected to its roots  whereas the progressives think the series is the best its ever been even though a lot of the core features are abandoned or toned down. any criticism is viewed as dissention in the new reformed fandom and you are just a hater now. so stupid.
happy friday everyone!!!
I am welcoming to new ideas and interesting stories even if it aspouses a world view I find to be foolish. what Im not welcoming to is a bunch of new writers devoid of an original thought taking something that we all love and is already established coming along  deconstructing it to fit their world view  then telling me that Im some  ist  or  phobe  for calling it bad.
dem rangs powah!!   roast away fair lady. roast those who defile our fandoms .
sorry Im late after a couple days but I just refuse to watch a series that is so insulting to the huge fandom of lotr. my mom read me the hobbit as a small kid. I ll just watch my extended dvd cuts and read my books.
they love living in denial the ole wokey dokeys. tolkien was such a conservative guy as well it winds them up so much to point it out. man was a devout catholic like.
to everyone claiming lotr fans are racist  that is always the cop out of the woke-- anyone who disagrees with them is labelled racist. because its easier than using logic and reason to debate. lotr fans aren t racist  we re disappointed that characters are being race swapped solely for diversity quotas which quite simply breaks the immersion of disbelief. the fans wouldn t advocate doing that to blank panther or any other series either  hence the backlash to the wokeness. tolkien purposefully based middle earth on icelandic and norse lore to create a mythology for britain that didn t exist. if you dont support blackface you shouldn t support whiteface either.
I love that hat.
Im a diehard tolkien fan  have been for almost 20 years  I would even call myself a junior tolkien scholar Ive studied all his work  his son s works and studied about him as an author and his biography. Im remaining skeptical about lotr series  but I am not going to criticize something I haven t seen - nobody has seen it and they re already calling itshit and ruined. one minute trailer means nothing. they could have just been some prominent outtakes to please to woke crowd and for all we know the rest of the series might be outright as white as the films. how do we know  nobody knows. and frankly  why do people care  if the story and script is excellent  it may not be  but that is yet to be seen  why does it matter what skin colour is used  Imean seriously...
I ll say it again.....you sound like the daughter from the incredibles only a bit more grown up.
your cat s a little dude. he wants to join in!  d
isn t  hate  part of some of these games
were not elsa  were not gonna let it go.
shame on the game developers who listened antia sarkeesian
odyssey and valhalla are my favorites. the old ones are just too boring for me and ive been playing since the first one when I was a teenager.
@antbaze97Â  too boring but you ve been playing since the beginning  what made you want to play the series to begin with then
@dying roseÂ  I find the older ones boring now I didn t when I started. they got repetitive for me not good at stealth. but hey if you like the older ones more than thats good for you and I respect it.
@antbaze97Â  there s a million things I could say but when it gets down to it we like what we wanna like. I hope you enjoy the upcoming infinity. I think it will probably be a successful project.
final fantasy is the same story  I hate the remake with a burning passion
@lucky strikezÂ  thats what I always hear from og fans. I guess it d be like if they changed ac1 or ac2 drastically. I get it.
ubisoft pushes the homosexual agenda so hard in the new ones. not to mention micro transactions galore. ubisoft has had a massive exodus of programmers. they are falling fast.
@antbaze97Â  so you like the 2 worst ones  origins was decent. odyssey was a fing joke. so long and repetitive. valhalla is a God of war cheap knock. that game was so fucking easy even on hard. the bugs and glitches in that game are unreal.  so assassin like running around using magical powers. ac2 and brotherhood are the goats. its not even ac anymore. its  cool history . they need to just drop the ac name.
@dying roseÂ  its gonna bomb harder than cyberpunk. no one wants this witcher type ac.
@john smithÂ  thats what I thought of valhalla. pissed off a lot of the old school fans  still a monetary success regardless. so we ll have to wait and see.
so  wokies. which side did tollers support in the spanish civil war   great and glorious was teh bootyhurt that day.
its the yelping of society.
we live in a society where gamers dont rule the world. think about that.
off topic but please do a short video about that big lara croft behind you.
where you get that nintendo controller hat !
I wonder if auto correct is the culprit melody.
yeah gatekeeping can be both bad and good.
moral compass
more than likely  its the autocorrect thats changing your name.  you go boom!
reddit bugmen love amazon lotr
melonie what s your thoughts on the 90s tomb raider comics
where did you get thatsnes hat    lol
so does the theonering also include all the fans saying the same things in the comments as the content creators who are  making money  off of their opinions. when on the trailer you have 95  of the comments all saying the same phrase essentially.
that hat though
shure people like anita can walk in and try to do things but remember its the people thatstil bought the games that are the real problem if she came in and changes things but no one buys it then she accomplished nothing.the problem is usualy the people tht dont know whats happening or they see  charc look diffirent but dont know the story behind it or they are oke with it those people let them get away with it.and ofc diffirent tastes and oppinions some people like the changes.who hold up lara is not a bad person she is just an adventure archeologist that was looking for treshure and secrets.I dont like lying at all but when the power that be are out of controle and treat you unfairly then its oke to cover youre own ass against vipers that try to take from you unjustly under pretence of beeing just.
moon knight!!

a good way to actually make a point is if you didn t monetize this video.
gatekeep the shit out of everything you like and care about. everything.
0 25 kitty
nice hat!
a mannequin she stole from forever 21. took it home and remodeled it after lara  lol.
it is a nes.
I honestly haven t really enjoyed video games for a little over 15 years now every once in a while I ll pick something up but I never play much more than an hour before Im sick of it there s just nothing captivating about anything anymore is a copy of a copy of a copy then again I remember getting a nintendo when it very first came out so maybe Im just too old for video games and interested in real life
the root of all evil is people not money  honey
where is the cat
1st ever!!! love your content  keep killing it. also here from the quartering

btw  no disney for me.  the amount of and number of times pedos that have been arrested from disney corp is alarming to say the least.
kitty!!!
if I dont like something I dont support it. they dont take my hard earn money. I ll take my business elsewhere
blaming content creators on youtube for the reaction to rings of power teaser is backwards.  my  wtf did I just watch  reaction to that teaser is why I now know who just some guy  critical drinker  and melonie mac are.on the women being evil topic about lara croft going from attractive and selfish to bland but good- what really confuses me is what is happening with female marvel characters.   the new ms marvel  is not just average  but overweight and frumpy looking.  her motives are more old school lara than marvel-  she wants fame  power  and cute guys.  compare that character with the current spiderman- Im not an expert on male attractiveness but the teen girls thatsat behind me during no way home seemed to be  and they were pleased with what they saw.  his character was so  lawful good  he spent and entire movie saving bad guys.
they used to be the place to go for lotr stuff  and they used to complain about the movies not being faithful. now they shill for this crap and it is the least faithful. they have just showed their stripes and they want to blame everyone else
did u win the contest yet melo
you nailed it! screw toxic positivity
bring back grunty. there was nothing good about her  she was just evil.
cool
nice hat
the truth hurts deal with it. man the hell up thats what I was taught growing up and I turned out ok well maybe
900th like. nice even number.
tolkien gateway is the only official webpage for tolkien information.
no I lost haha
@melonie mac go boom
to the ring of power shills. remember the ring wraiths..they gave their souls in exchange for power  wealth..they end up hollow and enslaved by an uncaring master..thats you now!
melonie with an  o . never noticed...oops.boomer
yer a sparky giggle of a gal ya know  love seeing that in a woman changes some of the bitterness sadly that makes you more valuable to the bitter pill dealers but personally..if you want to be happy quit what s not working for you Imean you quit veganism because it wasn t good for you if this content is trash to you  if it makes you unhappy..dont writhe around with it with all the maggots waiting for the next trash to dump regardless stay giggly in yer heart and mind saves people
too many franchises are dying on the altar of woke. gatekeep the shit out of what you love.
gatekeeping to keep cultural marxists out is essential.
I think oscar isaac did a very good jon  the show is meh at best. I will watch ep2 but dont have a lot of faith in the series
hell some gstekeeping is healthy. this abomination is the reason we need it!
its sad how bad modern feminism has screwed over average  non-insane activist women.
good.  websites defending amazon s rings of equity should die on that hill.  we dont need them.
how can anime get any more woke  thats such a preposterous front on the culture war it just seems bizarre to me. watch them come down on one piece lol.
I dont know what the show has done to lotr cause I ll never watch it. much like sw episodes 7-9. never even seen ep 9. they dont exist as far as Im concerned.dont buy woke games from woke companies. perceived legitimacy is all they have.see what happens when the money stops coming in.
first like.
melonie mac  I dont have agenda. also melonie mac  makes a video  about video games  to force religion onto people.  the hypocrisy of this channel is palpable.
Godzilla still sucks. all hail gigan.
it is hilarious how this video is trying to force ultra conservative protestantism on people.
I will never give it a chance. that chance gives them numbers  and they fuck up anything they can get their hands on. so  even if its free to watch  people shouldn t watch it.
