nothing screams male feminist like trying to get a girl fired because you dont like her opinion. that guy is everything wrong with the world.
I worked in the games industry for 5 years. its deeply deeply deeply left. I worked at a company with several hundred employees and there were maybe half a dozen people I knew who were conservative even a little bit. and only 3 people who were Christians. the entire industry is a giant echochamber  its very dangerous ideologically for any industry to be like that.
the irony of trying to make her  empowered  is that they created a scared little girl  not the powerful beast that old lara was  a killing machine with no fear. I cant stand what they did to her.
it is very refreshing to hear from someone involved in the gaming industry who isn t brainwashed and shilling the typical garbage we tend to hear from others.  thank you for being you  and having the guts to be honest and share your opinion.
we support you  melonie. if these gaming  news  outlets actually wanted to remain profitable  they would hire people like you instead of the insane activists.
melonie  youre really encouraging to listen to  especially when you bring up your faith. this is what we need is more content creators saying what they mean and being real  instead of putting on a fake mask to try and please others for the wrong reasons.
its funny. youre more of a role model for what women should be than these losers will ever be. not caring about the agenda and looking popular but instead standing up for what you believe in and not caving. thats courage. and there s far too few people that have guts anymore itseems.
hI  I am here from the quartering and just subscribed to you.  I heard about what happened to you with gamestop and just want you to know thatsomeone has your back.  I actually remember seeing you on the tv ads when I walked into the store and thinking you have great charisma and enthusiasm with a lot of expression as well as really pretty with a great voice.  I look forward to seeing your videos in the future - hang in there and remember you are awesome!
hey mel! Ive been following you since circa 2012  and Ive personally seen with my own eyes everything youre saying in this video  and I was always absolutely speechless by how rage fuelled the woke mob is towards you. you and me both have basically the same world views  and  because of that I was also stalked and bullied on gaming twitter. I eventually got sick of it after having a huuuuge hate mob coming after me calling me a antI  because I liked tweets against mandates and pro-freedom of choice. these people are crazy  but we should never bend the knee to them. never change who you are because a pychotic mass of people cant handle different opinions
omg girl. I wish there where more women like you. it get s lonely feeling like the only one. it good to know you are out there  its hard being a women and not having the  right way of thinking .
this is what a solid foundation of positivity looks like in the face of compensated narcissistic rage. never stop.
when you get heavy flak its because youre over the target. gamers are starving for channels that are genuine  truthful  humble  fun and dont talk down to their audience.  I look forward to seeing you succeed.p.s. pop filter  you need one.
Im glad that you ve not backed down to the bullies. its been my experience the more inclusive and open minded a person says  that they are  its actually the complete opposite. they are the most closed minded  bigoted  hate mongers in this big ole world.
as a Christian conservative and a gamer you seem like an awesome person. keep up the good work fighting the crazy woke and feminist crowds.
I never thought thought I would have any respect for gamestop again but big props to how they handled your situation and not bending the knee to the outrage mobs
I saw you on the quartering. im glad to sub to anyone who doesnt bend the knee to these woke weirdos. you seem intelligent and very nice. stay strong. keep givin these woke douch bags the middle finger. much respect!
we need more women like you in the gaming space influencers .
my favourite thing about you is how you are consistently like  hey these are my opinions. if you dont agree  cool  but you aren t gonna change me or make me do something I dont wanna do. dont ever change that about yourself
I didn t realize how many times people have tried to cancel you. Im not sure how long Ive been following you on social media  but from what Ive seen youre probably the nicest person I follow. plus seeing some of your Bible and positive quotes has really helped me get into a better mind set.
you are awesome! and you are a desperately-needed voice in the culture struggle. you have a very optimistic upbeat demeanor and have a way of telling the truth and even addressing conflict while projecting a good humor. its always a joy to see you on  fridaynighttights
facts
youre exactly right!
big agree
I dont really mind  yeah they made her more of a softy rather then the cool badass she was  but I like both of them.  though have to admit thatsometimes the  new  lara was a bit cringe  like her dialogue just before entering the mine in rise of tr  after them having made so many of the old lara croft  the reboot trilogy was refreshing  although I expected them to gradually move to the badass lara we all know  to make kind of a more sound origin story to how she slowly became the badas lara croft from the original . also a big fan of the more cinematic approach. especially love rise of the tombraider coz I love the indiana jones style stuff.  funny they even copy pasted literally the  bad  holy grail in it  the only thing I was annoyed by was the instructions that were put in for the braindead woke game journo morons that actually hate games and rather sit on twitter all day talking about meh diversity and meh identity.... like Im in the final level and you  get educated  on how to make a jump you made all throughout the game... like uuuh seriously ....
I was blown away by the first lara croft in the 1990 s not so much the last three.
agree  couldn t stand new lara  each-time they reboot characters they mess up the character s core or personality to boot. even in the movies I think jolie was better than vikander but thats my opinion.
Ive played the legend  anniversary   underworld games  and today s lara croft could definitely use a dose of her old sass.  in shadow she ranged from hysterical crying to psycho levels of coldness and it really gave me whiplash  the tombs were fantastic  its my hope that in the future square enix gives tomb raider the love and attention this fantastic ip deserves .  I heard about your plight on jeremy s channel  so sorry about the  cancellation  - and for such a stupid  non reason!  hang in there.
@rikariegaming  I am a little more reserved here  alicia imho has the range to do the role really well. and I think her first showing as lara was more of a genesis story. reality is you dont pop out of the womb being a badass  its a process. so let s see if she gets the chance to develop her role.that being said  one important aspect is she  alicia  needs to be given the chance. if the people in charge of the film dont give her that chance what can she do...
@xconundrumx  thats cool but I just couldn t enjoy her in the role even tho I was happy to go see the movie  I left the movie not feeling it.
@rikariegaming  I actually did. admittedly I think alicia is pretty easy on the eyes so that helps. but I think there might be a different reason too. I see this sometimes with dc and marvel too. people go in with expectations because there is a cartoon or in this case I guess a game that came first. I dont have that as much. I didn t really start out as a lara croft fan. possibly that explains why I am more open to seeing any follow ups that might come.but again I do fear they might be  as so much hollywood material is these days  overtly infused with ... well certain ideologies that run counter to fan expectations.
I would ve been fine with it if they did it for just the first game. but they refused to move past it.
old school lara croft was even about 6 ft tall  whereas the nu-lara croft is like 5 5 or something  and always crying.
I just cant believe we haven t got a remaster or re-release of the original trilogy on like nextgen consoles like I know we ll probably never get it now but it would be nice to be able to experience those games because Imissed out on the original series
@max master j  lol 6 feet old lara is 5 feet 6 inches not 6 feet
I honestly dont mind either. I like the change. yes  its not the same as the fearless  bad ass she was back  then  but the fact thatshe is scared  but still forges a head to overcome those obstacles makes her decidedly more interesting. she has flaws this time around  I like that about her.the 90s version we all grew up with had its place  that genre of video game was mostly hers during that time  but now its expanded. she has to stand out.
I end up liking both. but if the reboot lara was not named lara croft  it would be perfect.
@melonie mac go boom  when I first heard that they was going to do another tomb raider but not with the classic from the last one tr underworld game I was skeptical I wasn t going to get it but then I was like okay this is good first game yeah and then the second game I was like a  few changes it up a little bit and then the third game I was like they should do no more the last thing we need right now is last of us 2 fail we all saw how they felt when joe died
you know what we call that actual feminism.
some of us female gamers have been fighting this stupid stuff from the moment it came out. but usually we get ignored  or pushed under the rug  we dont really matter. since the stupidity is more popular then having common sense. I lost friends over   white fragility   stuff. also lost friends I played for years with  over   masculinity is not bad and should not be pushed as bad    . the arguments I had usually and up with me being called all isms and ists and bigot ofc. with all other insults you can add. so I dont use facebook ot twitter. and I comment only here on youtube. it is tiring to fight this battle constantly while being told you do not matter   cos some other chick matters more since she has   the right opinion   and you do not.
@the rotten    true that. it is just sad how it played out. and in a way still does. I do not post on any social media any more except youtube. it is tiring. the people I spent years with   gaming in the end turned on me cos of an idea. a trend. it was sad to see.
@arachnabell  I know. same happened to many who wouldn t fold to pressure and instead valued integrity.  ultimately though  better to find out who these people are sooner rather than later.
damn right  could not agree more  she s a true american hero. it does take a lot of courage  and a lot of heart to resist the easy way and just basically getting a free ride for agreeing with a garbage ideology that everyone knows is wrong  including the morons spouting it off like broken records  as if repeating it enough times will every make anything they say the truth.
sydney watson is one of my very top personal heroes  but I just found melonie the other day  and the more I watch her  the more I like her too.
blaire white is also up there  the courage she has is amazing. she s got a huge set of nuts on her  and Imean that with nothing but love lol
being a non essential is a role model  lol
she says gamestop treated her well... thequartinging mislead  to say the least  about the matter. if you listed to her video here  she lays it out clearly and it isn t how he did.
quartering videos quality are best describe by one of his subs as  fast food  it is true  he put out too much and they are all poor quality with his opinions which I already have similar to. eventually it gets boring  other gaming culture channel like itsagundam yeah that is top quality.
@throne  itsagundam  top tier

try its hard to find and date a girl like this.
@jack rorschach  no kidding I dont envy anyone looking to date women nowadays  but I promise you we re out there.
 ...

pop filter
isn t that the truth!!
just look at justine trudeau.
@mike carson  no. no one should be fired over a mere tweet. no one.  except  perhaps  those that make actual bodily threats or intend to do harm to someone physically.
@jchinckley  its called standard of behavior. most jobs have them which is why teacher cant say dumb stuff that would bring a bad light to a school. which is also why gina carono comparing her life to jews in nazI germany and a bunch of other tweets was too much for a child friendly network like disney. do you understand now
what we want is consistency. if gina carano set the standard than everybody at lucasfilm bashing on fans calling people nazis or pedro pascal all need to get fired.. tired of the rules for thee but not for me mentality hollywood is pushing
@mike carson  honestly I dont care about what trump may or may not be  he is not the current president nor is he likely to be the next president. I like facts not how you feel about a subject. show me repeated instances where he is racist and I ll concede otherwise this is a moot point .but let s get to your last post. first off his sister has sued family for not getting her fair share of inheritance so I wouldn t take her or any of her children s word at face value. as for the billions of other people  we ll I doubt  that they have first hand knowledge. as far as slave owners dating their slaves  well that left me speechless momentarily. I dont know where youre are from but I would not call what slave owners did to slaves either female or boys young men  dating  .. dating is usually a free choice on both parties based on physical attraction and usually common interests. but I do know  that the term racist is used way too freely and has lost its sting .its usually the last gasp of a liberal that has lost the intellectual battle. is donald trump bigoted maybe maybe not I do not know for certain because I do not know the man and sincerely doubt that you personally know him either. what I cantell you is that you bought into the smear narrative hook  line and sinker without looking into his past. this man has been in the public eye since the 1970 s and if he was racist it would have shown up long before he ran on the platform of draining the washington dc swamp of corruption . good luck in your future endeavors and dont let the media either left or right  taint the way you think do your own homework.
@mike carson  yet they had no problem with the other guy saying it  so it was fine if he did it  but it was not fine for her to do it  please explain the double standards here then
@mike carson  what standard of behavior  pedro pascal literally called people nazis. sit down. its called bias and fascism. its also called double standards. do you understand now  fool

they ve been after me ever since I came back to my faith  its ridiculous. they only left me alone when I rebelled from my faith for a couple years or so there and stayed quiet.
exactly.. Imean I know her more from twitter and never knew about so many cancellation attempt
same here I think Ive been following her for like 8  years and have never seen her not chipper
@melonie mac go boom  do yourenounce satin
@blickedupbandit  have you played with her online
@blickedupbandit  only if you give me enough denim lol
@blickedupbandit  Ive always preferred silk myself  especially where sheets are concerned lol.
mel continues to ignore the question.do you denounce satn!!
hello  melanie! Im so sorry that you were targeted by those kind of morons. unfortunately  the industry is loaded with these kind of people  that are in favor for censorship and tought hegemony.  but stay strong! wish you the best!
the dude who called you an internalized misogynist sounds big cringe. lol
I love the idea behind this channel. it has so much potential and Im all here for it. I love to hear your opinions  experiences  and beliefs thoroughly throughout the video. and for me a 10 minute video wont do that for me. I think this was the perfect length video for its subject. please continue making these longer vids!
I have gained a lot of respect for you in only a couple days. found out about yourecently through the 1 4ing. I appreciate you as a person. forget all these fickle clout chasing losers. its hard to stick to what you think is right and especially hard to find real people you cantrust. I highly relate. keep it up  you have support.
I remember one time when I went into gamestop I saw you on the tv hosting and told the cashier that I watch your content regularly and they said they do too and we said  she s awesome  at the same time. that was a cool moment and the cashier talked me into buying two other games
the thing I appreciate about you melonie! youre honest and genuine both in your personaility and opinons! you dont try to  get views by talking into an ear microphone and you love this content like we all do! support you 100 ! keeping being awesome!
youre awesome mel! youre a great voice of truth and hope in such a crazy society we have nowadays.
das what Im talkin about! I gotta admit Im gonna miss seeing you on gamestop screens but Im here to see what comes next for you  also Im sorry to hear that you felt down about a lot of things but I admire you for always picking your self up. never be afraid to speak your mind! you do you melonie! we got your back  much love   macwillnotbesilenced
Ive followed you on social media for  over 6 years now   I can confidently say youre simultaneously one of the nicest   most confident people Ive seen.your willingness to stand up for what you believe in is exemplary. keep it up!
I came over from the quartering. its nice to hear from someone who loves games and quotes scripture. you rock  girl!
good on you for sticking to your values while still respecting others of different opinions. the way I have seen it  you express your beliefs with both confidence and grace. also  I know as a fellow Christian its hard to stick to that in a very  woke  world  especially the entertainment industry.
just discovered your channel.  love your take  love your faith  love your strength.  I ll be absorbing your content trying to catch up the past 8 months.
nice to meet ya melonie. I just caught on to you today on your show with the drinker. I am really impressed with your knowledge and just the ease in which you call up facts. your mind is a gaming encyclopaedia. smart is so refreshing in today s world of ranting buffoons. good luck with the new channel!
jeremy did a video about you getting canceled for simply being friendly to him. he said this is social commentary from a different perspective  which I enjoy.post episode edit  youre honest  you are an individualist  you stick to your guns and you accept reality. Im sticking around. you are amazing. youremind me of a podcast I listen to.
good for you melonie! I feel like social media has created a hive mind that rejects anyone that has any form of differential opinion.  you are one of the shining lights thatstands out in the face of the wave of darkness that is washing over this country and I think you deserve a lot of respect and props for that.
itsucks that you had to go through that  but Im glad you were strong in the face of that. glad to follow you now that youre doing your own thing.
mel you are one of the real ones.  so grateful for you.  never surrender and never apologize.
I honestly never heard of you until jeremy shouted you out. when he said they ve tried to cancel you I was on board though. should really be referred to as cancer culture because thats all they are.
sorry to hear that all this stuff has happened to you over the last few years. Im glad to see a strong woman like you stand up for yourself and others in these trying times where our opinions are being crushed by society and the government. free speech and bodily autonomy is a bastion of light needed in this time of society.
Im happy that those crappy wierdos didnt cause you problems at gamestop. I havent been there in like forever  but I thought it was cool on those rare occasions seeing you on the tv there. Im still sticking with being a longtime fan of yours  and you continue to inspire me to be myself even when it gets hard.
oh he was  the memes just made themselves and it was hilarious
to use their language  he mansplained to her. the cognitive dissonance with folks who share these beliefs is hilarious.
and then eveybody in the gamestop clapped.
@set zor  that meme doesnt make sense in this context
I was wondering who that was cuz she was talking about upcoming tomb raider I think rumored of mortal kombat xl and a few other games and john told me she sponsored for us I was like thats cool
thats so nice of you to say - thank you!
melonie mac you are coolyou cant let those mobs stop you from doing what you loveyou have a whole army of subscribers that will stand up with you against the cancel culturekeep up the good work!
Ive watched you for like 10 years or more  Ive lost track at this point.  f the noise and the angry cancel mob  some day I hope Imanage to meet you at an event or something to just give you a damn hug.  keep doing you like you always have and stay strong.  bow to no one.
good to hear someone with a voice of reason in the gaming space. keep doing you girl  you are standing out more and more for just being yourself
glad to see you on a new channel and posting the stuff that you like and not what others wish for you to speak on. we need more individuals such as yourself saying what s on your mind. lol
props to you for sticking up for yourself. stay strong!
I did not follow you before all this debacle  but now that I do I started to dig a bit dip and going trough your old stuff just to get a better sense of you  and I gotta say you have become my gamer hero of this new era! thanks for being a voice for many of us!
dang girl sorry to hear all thatstuff happened to. glad to hear that you took the high road and came out on top. looking forward to watching some more videos from you and hearing your opinions.
melanie I love you so much. everytime you came on at gamestop tv talking about stuff its always enjoyment and outstanding work you do  for them firing you is such a shame and losing a great host with awesome personality. I guess you were too much of a heaven ray of light for them to handle.
mel dropping that boom. still bugs me that people harassed her when she spoke about other cases  when they were initially  hey  you shouldn t harass women.  so...its fine for you guys then  go get  em  mel.
while I do miss seeing you on the television at work  I enjoy viewing your content on facebook  instagram  and twitter much more. hope to see your channel kick off! I also hope your grandmother gets better.
ive gained even more respect for you than I did. I love that you arent afraid to be yourself
no matter what  its better being cancelled than being woke. besides  I just discovered you 8 months after this video went up and I see youre doing well with this channel. keep up the good work.
true og in the industry  glad to see you are still out here doing your thing.
I used to work at gamestop several years ago. I always hated the cringe of gamestop tv played on repeat all day  especially the creepy plastic way they make the hosts act. you definitely always seemed like the sanest one there and Im glad to see that I was right. its nice to see the depth of the real you.
fair play to you for not calling out those so called friends and colleagues. that takes some serious will power
congratulations on the new channel! I followed your first channel because of the quartering  and now this 2nd. stay strong  dont give in to crybullies.
the way you laugh off the people trying to tear you down is so funny and cool  youre something else! yes Im simping a bit but this is a rare occurrence so I dont care
breath of fresh air whenever I hear someone who cantruly speak their mind. came here from the quartering and Im here to stay. great job. we need more people like this.
here because I found out about this channel from watching the quartering s video.  you deserve better than what you went through.  you keep going with what youre doing and to hell with what some cancel clout seeking  basement dwelling dirtbag thinks.
14 57 thank you for saying this. yes I am one of those that did get said  medical procedure  done lol  but I didn t force anyone to get it. its silly the things people fight over these days  when it can all be solved if everyone simply acknowledged that everyone has different opinions and beliefs.

@le radmuiel  pretty much.
 ....
 ....

Im not one for revenge - never worth it. thank you
I know the person you are talking about at the beginning of this video  and I wont repeat his name out of respect for you since you didn t name him. he is honestly one of the most disgusting  and miserable people Ive ever seen online  and that covers a lot of ground. I remember how hateful he was towards you  and this was someone who supposedly respects women. Im sorry that all of those people turned their backs on you. I can imagine that hurt a lot  and I have a lot of respect for you being able to stay strong through a situation like that. Ive said this before many times  but I dont think I ll ever come to terms with the fact that we now live in a society where people simply cant respectfully disagree on anything with somebody pulling out a flaming pitchfork. dont worry  if the mob ever tries to come after you again  a lot of people like myself have your back!Im glad you made this channel to express more of your personal thoughts on topics  and I look forward to seeing more videos! Imight agree or disagree on certain topics  but at the end of the day  you have my support. I know a lot of people cant grasp the mindset of being able to respectfully agree or disagree on a topic  but I would like to try to bring some common sense back to this world lol
I remember you when I worked for gamestop. welcome to the free thinkers side. keep up the good work and I look forward to your future content! thank you for being a voice for others!
came over from the quartering. the world has become an incredibly toxic place lately  its to the point thatsome of my relatives cant directly follow people on social media for worry of backlash from others. personally I dont care  I just support anyone who suffers cancellation in whatever form. everyone deserves a space where they can speak freely and be respected as a human being.
never apologize to the mob !! just subscribed!! need more good people like you
watching your newly presented content has made me realize how cool   civil you are  keep the videos coming melonie!
I remember you on gamestop. you were awesome and I loved to watch you when I was in the store shopping. my friends and brother would get mad cause I wouldn t leave the store til your talks were over. you know your stuff girl on games and I enjoyed listen to it. I remember when I worked at gamestop back in 2012 and there was many people that knew their job but enjoyed after I left going in and listen to yours and a few others too. glad to see you here hopefully you start a rumble or bitchute  too as a backup.
excellent vod  mel! I am super happy that you are fully being yourself  saying whatever you want to say   that you do not care what other people think of you. 0 fucks given mac is the best mac. you are a voice of reason in a space that has a ton of unreasonable people and good on you for sticking to your values   opinions while still respecting other s values   opinions. I believe that this channel will become very successful. I always love hearing your views  opinions   tangents on things and so far they have always aligned with my views   opinions. next time someone s  tries to cancel you  Im coming at them hard  I always got your back friendo!
my goodness   melonie is awesome.  much respect for being true to yourself
another high level integrity channel in my collection.  looking forward for more of such good natured content.shout-out from the quartering btw.
stay strong! you have all my respect for having your own opinion and standing by it  you are brave!
love thatstrong women like you and gina carano are taking a stand for your beliefs. I also like that you aren t afraid to share your faith.  your a beautiful lady inside and out! God bless and keep doing your thing!
I remember seeing you on gamestop tv when I used to work there too  think of it as a blessing that youre out of there. one of the worst companies to work for imo. just liked and subbed  keep it up!
as a great man once said.  love many  trust few and paddle your own canoe   great to see you applying this motif. keep up the great work mel and shout out from australia for king and country!!  -
cant say I 100  like game stop for a few reasons  I give them mad respect for not sacking you over the cancel mobs. so many notable companies out there would have done away with you without a second thought  so definitely props to them. but I will say  I thought for some reason you were with gs for like a decade or something xd maybe time has just blurred that much since Im 27  but it felt like I was seeing you on the tvs in shop since I was a teen. I know you dont need me to say it  but keep being yourself and honest as you are  I clicked follow because I appreciate youre like that  and totally not because I thought you also looked cute while being badass  _
you go mel ! I love hearing your stories
first time follower. its great to see more people stand up for there beliefs.  really enjoy the openness of the conversation. you got my support.
heard about this channel from the quartering.  good to hear the perspective from someone that was a target for simply doing their job and didn t actually do anything in the game space and has pretty much come out unscathed aside from the friends or colleagues that are two-faced  talk about separating the wheat from the chaff.I d say thats the kind of protection you get from the grace of God  because Ive seen him have my mom s back in similar ways when confronted with that kind of back biting.also  its nice to see another full form video as opposed to the super cut up flow of talking.  nothing against that type of video style  but the unedited conversing is a nice change of pace from what the norm is on googletube.
stay the course  lead the way.  the fact youre getting this static is proof its working and people are listening. well played
Im a 49 yr old gamer  a conservative and a Christian. Ive followed you for years and you making this channel is awesome. its refreshing to see someone be themselves and not bend to the  woke  cancel culture mob. you ve definitely made me an even bigger fan and I will share your channel with all my friends. keep being you and kicking tail.
Im so happy things are working out for you!!
also  great thumbnail! love it!
as Ive discussed with a number of friends over these last couple of years of insanity  I just cant comprehend that idea of being friends with someone for years and then suddenly dropping them just because they disagree with one or two points  political or otherwise.  you d think the friendship was more important than that  but I guess to some folks their political ideologies are more important than friends.  hey  at least you know who actually cares about you and who doesnt nowadays.
the fact that this person quote tweeted you without reaching out to you privately says a lot. I am so sorry you went through that.
found you through guys like critical drinker and nerdrotic  and your content is just as enjoyable. crazy what you went through to get here  but Im sure youre finding it more enjoyable at this point lol look forward to more!
proud of you melanie
following you on twitter has been great this past year or 2  going from  nice  mel to 0 fucks given and just being yourself  I love itnot gonna say I agree with some of the stuff you say  but thats your life   you do you and keep going girl!
I am so glad you stood up to the crybullies. the irony about people trying to censor is that the person  book  movie etc. they are trying to shutdown becomes more well known than ever. I came here from the quartering s channel. good luck!
I was so sad to hear this story. after watching jeremy s video you seem like a cool girl. what s truly heartbreaking is Im a big fan of gamestop as Im an amc ape investor  as Im fighting against the corruption on wall street. against naked short selling  dark pool abuse  fud articles from mainstream media owned by hedge funds  and for market transparency and fairness. it deeply saddens me to see this woke stuff going on in gamestop. as Im fighting for something good and positive on one side and they are now doing something bad on the other side. I hope and pray they get some backlash and investigate it and look into it and reverse course. bc they cant afford to get political and lose 1 2 of their investors. I will continue to support amc but will have to greatly reconsider supporting gme in the future. Im rooting for your success and applaud you for standing up for your beliefs even when its not popular.
youre right about the femme-fatale imagery that we seem to be losing  the insanely attractive feminine bad-ass who can handle herself in just about any situation without falling back on a victim mentality simply because she is a woman. give me jem with a switchblade and Im good to go!
glad to be here  cant wait to hear you uncensored and I pretty much subbed immediately  if you get political  I just hope gfuel doesnt drop you and stand by you  keep up the great work!
the best thing about your channel was your honesty. shame you had to create an entirely new channel just to be able to speak your mind. in today s day and age you cant have an opinion without someone trying to cancel you because they dont like your opinion.
well  if Im not gonna get a meloniemacasmr channel  this is definitely the next best thing. looking forward to hearing and seeing you speak your mind freely and openly. long live liberty and freedom!
came here b c jeremy really talked you up. and now going from here straight to rumble to follow. if you post I ll watch one and let the other play just because. and being a og croft fan a stream from a gun range would be pure fire.
came here because the quartering did a bit on you. I never heard of you but we have to support sanity over the woke insane! good luck with this channel!
Imay be in the minority here but I love the longer videos of mel s. when Im listening watching the video im also the majority of the time are working on something and listen to what she s going on about and strangely it listening to her videos improve my work and quality output.
Im with you even in bad times girl  Im not going anywhere    and remember   the eagle doesnt care for flies
oh my gosh  you are so much like my sister-in-law  miranda! your mannerisms and hand gestures. its so funny! anyway  found you through the critical drinker. been checking out your content not a gaming fan  but I dig your take on  prey  and your pov on other cultural issues. its nice to see a fellow believer in the arena of trending cultural topics standing her ground and fighting the good fight  -
never knew about you before  the quartering   and have enjoyed hearing from you ever since. you ve got a unique take on the world. even though I dont always agree  I enjoy your thoughts   because real adults dont get offended at thatstuff.
cute  gamer girl  into fitness  not woke  plenty of girls have one or two of those  but all of them  idk what happened but from my perspective  your ex lost out on a great catch. I struggle with finding girls my age who aren t woke  for starters. and nerdy girls usually aren t into fitness  but I am and thats important to me.I remember when some people freaked out when you brought up the jab  so I get where youre coming from and Im definitely here for the new channel. looking forward to seeing what you put out!
I used to work at gamestop about 2 years ago. I used to look forward to when they played a new episode. I dont go in there much anymore  but im sorry to hear you got fired for stupid reasons. I totally agree with your opinion by the way. my body my choice.
been following you for a long time now. learned a few new details along the way. some  I agree with... others  not so much. thatsaid  as Ive noted before friends wont always agree. thats normal and fine. I d rather know you for who you are than have you pretend to be someone youre not.followed this channel too.  you do you  my friend. Im sticking around.
this really means so much  thank you
@melonie mac go boom  dont even trip dawg
and he is misleading  understatement  about this matter.  it is disgusting.
@thewhiskeycowboy  everything he does it misleading and clickbait.  he doesnt care about anything then pumping out dozens or videos a month
just subbed. came over from the quartering s channel. stay strong and keep up the good fight!!! I remember walking into game stops and seen you on the t.v. always thought you knew what you were talking about when it came to gaming
hey! great intro - a genuine channel that has significant potential.we need more creative intelligent sassy voices. this cancel culture s out of control. ppl seriously need to mind their own business and contribute to society. btw love dogs and cats! notice you had a pup lounging behind you. what s your pup s name
this is awesome melonie!  Im glad that you are going to be focusing more on this style of content  as it was why I originally followed you.  its a shame that you cant just use your main channel for it  but I understand your reasoning for it.I wish you the best of luck growing this channel and look forward to its future content!
as ever melonie  it is good to hear you discuss these points.
just found your channel  here from sacred symbols. I have to say you make excellent content. never stop doing what you want to as a creator  keep up the great work.
Im not a big fan a the quartering   I give him a chance every now and again but I think he had a video about you titled   gamestop employyee fired for knowing me . now I didnt watch the video so the title might have been a joke but he s had some really bad takes and his hyperbolic titles are part of the problem. any way I stumbled on to your video and while Im sad you went through what you went through  im glad you pushed back and stood strong. youre allowed to have your own opinion and a platform to voice it on just as the quartering is allowed to have one. def subscribing and looking forward to seeing more of your content
dont ever loose your passion. you have an enormous range of talent.
this is my first time watching you and I think youre amazing and please keep it up I believe in our freedom of choice
preach girl  this is so refreshing to see someone not be woke in the gaming community
there s nothing more beautiful than a true american woman     Im really glad I found you youtube actually recommended something good for once lol
ha ha  mel is still rocking and knocking them all down. mel is and always will be the most realistic and down to earth non fake gamer I have come across and have conversed with.
just found out about you from the quartering. I think you are fantastic  and I love your faith and your personality! looking forward to seeing more of your content
sorry to hear that you got harassed by these people who have nothing better to do with their life. you didn t deserve to be treated like that. its pretty sad thatsome people have nothing better to do in their life so they have to try to  cancel  other people   try to make them feel miserable. you ll always have my support mel. sorry that those people threw you under the bus. I would never do that. Ive always got you back and support you 100
I have a lot of the same views as you. I did not realize that. I cant stand cancel culture.  its like they cant have their own opinion anymore. as far as choosing to get the you know what  Im not against it either but I feel itshould be your choice. if you want the you know what  fine!  get it. Im happy for you but stop trying to guilt and force it on the rest of us!!  I will always have your back mel!!!  love the biblical and motivational posts on your social media. I struggle with weight loss and am finding motivation thru your posts. thank you.
youre one of the biggest influences for me to be myself on my streams and videos. who cares if the woke mob comes for you  if youre true to yourself  then you ll go far    keep up all the great work! its my dream to be based and a gamer channel at the same time.
just found out that you had this other channel  about the pokey pokey  the fact that they had to dig up something you said from when you were 17  we say stupid shit at that age  its not like you bullied someone or robbed a store  proves they couldn t even think of something to respond to you with. I didn t get the poke either  and Im glad youtube personalities such as yourself spoke about our right to not get the poke and that we shouldn t be discriminated for it. Im also very loud and clear about that as I lost a lot of opportunities because of mandates and its nice to see youtubers do the same.
decent  pragmatic and intelligent.  a rare combination these days.   glad I stumbled upon this channel.  -
one thing I have learned recently... the more woke someone is... the less likely they are to be your friend.   if your views do not conform to theirs  they will drop you no matter how far back your friendship goes or how much you ve helped them in the past.
keep it up we need more female role models like yourself. honest powerful and    .
hImelonie! I just heard about your ousting from gamestop tv from the quartering... I can relate... Im a brown dude who has been called a racist  a white supremacist  a nazI  privileged  and much more... usually by white leftists  because I dont share their ideals. Ive even recently had a customer call my regional manager to try to get me fired from my job  saying I was being racist and political in a conversation where there wasn t even any mention of  race or politics. I simply said that I wasn t afraid of covid. Im vaxed... Im not old... Im in good shape... plus I believe I already had covid. it was literally a 2 minute conversation  but me not being afraid of covid is apparently enough to try to get me fired and labeled a racist  by a white customer .I am fed up with woke leftists trying to get everyone cancelled  and Im glad you are fighting back against these lunatics.
thank you!  d
of course! Ive followed you on twitter since wayyyyy before your tomb raider debacle so I feel like its so vindicating to hear all this and you haven t backed down lol
 .....
Ive been supporting you ever since the early days and its so surreal seeing you still doing you after all these years. Im so glad youre still around because it keeps me relatively sane in this era of social media.one of the main reasons Im hesitant about doing anything within the gaming space is because of how everyone is forced to walk on eggshells at all times and its harder for people that are just starting to get a foot in the door without having to subscribe to the woke agenda to survive.
coming from the 90s gaming scene  I agreed with you on the lara croft take. I dont hate the new games  but I absolutely loved the original games and two is still in my top five of all time in terms of games during that period.
just keep being you! let the  butt hurt  people lose by you keep on doing what youre doing!
well  you got me to subscribe to you and I hardly subscribe to anyone. Ive been following you on twitter and twitch for quite a while. its refreshing to see you grow and stand your ground on what you think. especially since so many people eventually cave. hats off to you and stay awesome.still waiting for you to play baiken or get brushed up on some axl so I can challenge you.
people often have surprising sides. biggest one for me was a coworker who I d describe as a very likable dude  affable  great work ethic  etc.learned he did a few years for embezzling and stealing the leukemia charity box. I was shocked.
real content... honest content.  love it.
was a store manager at highland village location and always looked forward to seeing your new content on the screen at the store. been following you on twitter for a while and am just really happy that youre now feeling free and yourself again. thats so valuable. dont ever stop. keep going and prove all the haters wrong. much love. peace and love.
stay strong! may not agree with everything but you ve got my support!
I frickin love you girly. nothing more amazing than patriotism. keep it up. we have your back. we are freedom loving. this tyranny shall fall
sorry to hear all the crazy stuff. a lot of people seem to have been going through the same the last 6 years or so. I have had the same happen to me.  stay strong!
you have the look and the personality to grow a lot. you should go all in  and idk  go on friday night thighs and other live streams. be yourself and dont be afraid to be  offensive  and fun. the more you are unwoke the more people will flock here.
love the name to the new page. this will work out real well for you. cant wait to see what s in store for the future. you got this on lock.
I had no idea you ve been dealing with all of that  melonie! youre amazing and dont let anyone crush your wonderful spirit -coco
hImelonie  I came here from the video released by the quartering. I do not follow him but have seen many of his videos and he seems like a really nice guy. the fact that you are being treated the way you are because youre friends with him is ridiculous. I have subscribed your channel and look forward to your future videos!
not long cam across your channel  glad to see those bullies did not stop you. these people are ignorant narcissists and very totalitarian  keep true to yourself and keep with God the idea of saying someone shouldn t be alive because they have a different idea or are different to them  seems to be what someone said to you watchI this  is literally what the nazis thought  one day people will look back at how people act now and cringe.
new sub here. maybe its confirmation bias  but I love this new commentary channel already  and can easily see myself watching every new video that comes out  because you sound like an awesome person.
it is ridiculously ironic that the people who usually say   my body  my choice!  are now saying   if you dont put a substance of our choosing into your body  you must suffer the consequences!
thanks for sharing. your a dope ass chick and super talented. everything happened for a reason. you are right where you need to be. keep rocking out super star!
ya are amazing  in more ways then one. how far you ve come  from the scar s of the past. really hope you keep strong. it hurts to loose friends due to this over sensitive political mayhem that has occured in this nation. I think when a nation restricts speech that is a unpopular  or tries to remove  the past because they re beliefs dont aline with historical a figures doings  is a self a deprecating society that is bound to repeat previous mistakes in new way. anyway thats enough from me. hope you take care mel.
I hope your g-fuel sponsor last a while  because I have been wanting to try it out  but found out it was quite expensive to ship  so is going to wait until I can do a larger order.
I hope it lasts a while too  I freaking love them! thank you for the kind words
@melonie mac go boom  it was actually because of your google drive coach boot camp pdf that I wanted to get some g-fuel and it has also finally gotten me started on slowly transitioning to a meat diet  although  Im taking some time to transition  as I need to slowly phase out certain foods  but so far  Im already eating around 250g of meat a day  which leaves me more full than before and I can see Im slowly beginning to loose weight.
the quartering sent me I enjoy all different content even more so when trash people try to cancel someone for insane reasons  with your experience you should collaborate with geeks   gamers ...cancel crowd always kicks in the streisand effect.
happy to see you fighting against bullies.
after watching this today. I didn t know who you were but you have my respect and you ll always have my support
haha I completely forgot defraudo existed until you mentioned that tweet. I digress  crazy story but honestly I doubt anyone is surprised by all this. the world is a changing place  soon your opinions will be more mainstream as the woke crowd and ... other not u tube friendly reasons you are being cancelled are dissolving in front of our eyes. keep strong and keep the message going you will be rewarded for it I am sure as the world slowly reasons with itself.
please stay true to who you are we all need to get back to the place that we cantalk about things and disagree agreeably its ok to have your own opinion about things
several things first  Im late commenting on this vid.  I know that.  but Im horribly old  so you ve got to expect me to be slow. youre brilliant.  I love that youre up front and straightforward about what you think and feel and what is important to you.  awesome.youre fun.  I enjoy listening to you ramble for 30 minutes for the insights into your mind and attitude.youre so much what young women should be.Im shocked that you expect me to believe that youre 30  much less 35.   Imean  you ve got the wisdom and insight that often comes from experience  but I thought you were just an incredibly wise 22-24 year old.  good on you for still having the youthful energy and enthusiasm.  thats key.I like that faith matters to you.  I know I d not survive without mine  but its nice to see someone so willing to be public about theirs  especially with a channel that focuses on other things.keep up the great work  and go boom.
the one thing Ive noticed about melonie mac she doesnt make her videos choppy. I appreciate that.
came for the quartering  stayed for the burp control  subscribed for the opinions.
I didn t even know you were in the videogame industry  until seeing this video.  I remembered a mention in an older quartering video  but didn t follow that up.its nice to hear that you like where youre at in terms of content creation.
you are friggin great ! never change ! stay true to yourself !
great first video! do and talk about whatever youre passionate about with no regrets. twitter never has been nor will be representative of the larger population  so dont give them an ounce of control. everyone else has your back.
didn t know about you til now  but you got my support. stay strong!
congrats and I wish the best for you and your channel!!  goboom !
Christ on a bike she s mesmerizingly pretty. not backing down  being your own person  and being mildly sane in some clearly insane times  those are amazing qualities. glad to see it  and I really appreciate her defending jeremythis must be the sexism in gaming that frosk was whingeing about though haha
congratulations on the new channel! looking forward to good things!
I loved your video and your personality so much. then when you brought up romans 8 28 I subbed. never compromise who you are or what you beleive in to appease the masses. hope you have great success on your new channel!
hey melonie I just want to tell you that this is a best video that you have done for today. anyway I am truly happy for you and keep going for your dreams of making videos like this  ok. anyway congrats to you and I will always follow you on twitch   twitter and on youtube  ok. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets  ok. also stay warm too.
melonie God bless you. jeremy sent me and hopefully many other new subscribers. so far so good and I hope to see more videos!we got your back and so does God
dont back down  be yourself  be authentic... and the times will come around in your favor. you are just caught at the tail end of an era of dumb  left overs . they will soon retreat back under their rocks.more power to you!
I was wondering why I didn t see you in any of their videos lately. I even share the same views as you when it came to games  its a shame when people you thought are friends stab you in the back for having different opinions and friends.
I wish you the best! you are so right to feel that way about lara craft. its evil the way they treat you.I will your channel a try. your personality is uplifting.
I knew I could trust g-fuel when roman atwood became friends with matt from demo ranch and began to openly discuss that he is a Christian  and a gun owner and nothing that the  audience  can say or do will change who and what he is. Im glad you have them. also  knowing youre doing keto carnivore with g-fuel made me also decide that because they stand by you  I will be switching from bang energy to g-fuel. so  I hope you get some kick-back when people use your coupon code  because I am about to start spending a couple hundred a month on that. keep being who you are  because thats the woman that your audience loves and sticks around for.
I love hearing your opinions! keep doing what youre doing.
keep doing what you do! jeremy from  the quartering sent me! remind yourself of the following truth  you are free. its true that we live in an upside down time in wwhich pressing the like button can have untold consequences. but giving in to those who seek to confine you only hurts you in the long run. your loss of self is the most significant thing that could be taken away from you. dont give it up for anything!
so happy for you  melonie!  and omg the outro!!! 32 14
glad you are able to speak freely. you are interesting and entertaining and bring values that are important to the space.
sorry to hear you got canceled again. just saw jeremy s video. we need to get you on fnt! warning though  they re very   problematic  to certain people.
when you left gamestop  so did i. glad to see you killing it. it d be cool to collab on some gaming shit one day
Ive been following you since you were gaming fortnite on fb and its great to see you back stronger then ever. haters are gonna hate and I love that you are above all that. and I liked the old lara croft as well. Ive been a lara fan since the game first came out. and I agree! for me the lara character has lost its way a bit. best of luck with your new channel.
itseems youre doing great to me! if anything goes down I will defend you. plain and simple.all those people whining are idiots. they give what they put out. also many people said crazy stuff online but I am shocked they thought they would cancel you over all of that.
sub from the quartering. glad to follow and support anyone who canthink for themselves and form their own opinions thoughts values and morals. look forward to your future vids!
never heard of you. but glad I found you! you are intelligent and attractive. we are allowed to have opinions.  so hope I this channel goes over 100 000 very quickly.
here to support you and  your healthy choices!
I wish I could have a 10 minute conversation with melonie.
well  hopefully gfuel takes care of you for a long time! always looking forward to more videos from you!
found your channels when the quartering mentioned yourecently.  from keto to gaming and commentary  its all great.  have a sub and keep it up.
huge respect melonie!
heard about your channel from the quartering  sorry to hear about people trying to cancel you for having an opinion  opinions I happen to agree with. Im a big tomb raider fan also and I agree about the make under of lara croft and I think the game is now very different from the originals too. I preferred the older one s. this cancel culture is ruining everything especially gaming. liked your video
3 things  subscribed  checked out video due to the quartering and find you intelligent as well as genuine. secondly  cancel culture is the weak wanting power. powerful people dont need to impose their will on others in everyday life. thirdly  I like both iterations of lara croft  but I definitely prefer the original. I also dont like the idea of why she was changed. good luck with the channels. looking good so far  young lady. I ll stay subscribed   watch as long as you dont bend the knee.
I remember hearing about you being problematic and what not.never seen anything to show me why.then I came across your channel.watched a video with an open mind and who knew that you are actually one of the coolest chicks.glad I did.
I hope so too - I love them!  d
25 34 very smart move. almost like an art of war type tactic. give them nothing.
Im sure most people with a good head on their shoulders would agree  but I get more upset at the people who step down because of cancel culture than the people who try to cancel them. dont take shit and stop what youre doing just because someone is kicking and screaming on the floor like a 3 year old  laugh it off and move on.
we ve got your back girl! keep it up!
the scariest thing I have seen in the last 2 years is how quickly people give up freedom for false security do they not know when you give up freedom for safety you get neither
this is nuts  I swear when I was in a gamestop sometime around november  mel was on the tv. such a bummer
youre awesome. you have no idea how few female youtubers I tolerate and follow
Imiss the host you guys made it easy to get reservations on everything lol
here from the quartering  5 min in and Im sold   new sub  look forward to watching ur new content. we absolutely need more women calling out the many dumpster fires that exist in our modern society.
we have all said or done things when we were kids that would make us shake our heads today. nobody should be held to account for something so minor when they were still young.
yo mel  came over from jeremy s channel. keep pumping out the good content and we ll be here for a while. good luck on your new venture!
youre amazing. stay true to yourself.
I  too  had never noticed how many times people have tried canceling you  s. Ive been following you on twitch and youtube for... years. I cant even remember how long. sorry the woke idiots are doing this to you and know you ve got a lot more support than you do haters!
youre definitely my favorite gaming personality.  you stay true to your beliefs and I respect that.  insta-sub!
hey there ! just watched jeremy doing a video about you. I am sorry for you  being attacked by a bunch of assholes.I agree with your opinions mostly most  and by the way lara looked cooler without the surgery they did on her.stay motivated and strong with your opinion.they control usthey console uswhy do all these places hold us
Im also 35  and I cant for the life of me think of any sites where I d still have posts from 2003 when I was 17. most of anything from that era are long gone  barring the archive machine. thats some petty shit from the cancel crowd.
we support you girl!!!!!
never give up.   never surrender.   bending the knee never satisfies them.
I have family members who have unfriended me for my beliefs  so youre definitely not alone in this.
cancelling someone over a nearly 20 year old forum post when you were a Goddamn teenager is absolutely pathetic. but of course thats just par for the course for cancel culture.last week  a professional wrestler was cancelled for similar reasons. he said some messed up holocaust denying crap way back in 2011 and he says he no longer holds those views  even apologized for those views   but the mob still went after him.
found your channel recently trough your ring of power videos and watching that video I suddenly realized I knew you from your gamestop days. you are a funny and true personne  ill watch you from now on
haha was fun times!
huge compliment - thank you soooo much!
she seems perfectly reasonable   normal. explains why they are trying to cancel her.the crazies cant handle reasonable   normal people.
thank you for talking about this
just discovered this channel and binging your videos. maybe Im a bit late to the party  but good luck with the channel and have fun making content!
if the pandemic taught me anything at all  its which one of my friends that were on social media would have turned in anne frank. I actually cut a lot of friends that turned toxic during the pandemic out of my life.
all of this I remember! I remember following your stories closely and even commenting on your threads. I was there  I was there 3000 years ago. in the fires of mount doom.
hey mel! somehow you fell off my radar for years and years. the quartering was how I finally found you again. glad I did. youre a real one.
I like how normal she is
this has actually aged really well  like most classy things do.
just came across this channel  much respect for being real and not being a sheep on the woke bandwagon. subbed!
I did not register in my head  that you were that girl on gamesstop. I was recommended the video the other day  and today I decided to seek the video to see what it was about. color me surprised.I discovered you via quartering  and subscribed to your main channel. I didn t know you had an alternate channel. Im subscribed now.
melonie youre fuckin awesome always absolutely luv all your content and eff the woke twitter crowd Im sorry that happened but good fo you darlin
never listen to those people. I grew up during the 90s with lara s classic iconic look and I also miss it  so trust me there is plenty fans still out there of her original look  -
I dig everything youre saying. Im on board with you
considering you have years of experience in game streaming television  ever thought of doing something like that on your own as well  with you as the producer  using your channel
glad to learn about you and see how great of a person you are. I will ask  can we please meet the doggo at 29 16    d look forward to seeing where your content goes!
you are really smart. its not its not that common for a public figure to be as brave as you. btw your instagram is cool. keep up the good work.
imagine people being against someone making a decision on what they put into their own body. blows my mind. selfish  um. ya. thats how that works.
youre my hero. never back down
good luck  hopefully this channel blows up in popularity!
glad I found your channel trough jeremy. straight away subscribed. watched both of the videos so far. insane world   but sane people here    btw I agree with your view on the laura game 1000
thank you for being you  melonie.
hello melonie  I watched quarterings video and came over to subscibe to you. keep your head up girl and as far as the haters go  they can gfts. hang in their girl and never apologize.
she s 35  I thought she was like 10 years younger than that.itsounds like she got caught in the crosshairs of the mob. its really sad since nothing she said was unreasonable.
love your video! thats what we need  more people against woke culture! God bless you
@19 30  yo this girl is real af. she has the full experience that not everyone gets. probably has great judgement from being an observer over the years.
subscribed here from the quartering to help you out battling the cancel culture....keep up the fight.
the mob comes for us all eventually.  thats why I ll stay an anon for as long as I can.  however  its good that people stand their ground publicly  like youre doing.  respect.
came across your channel today from the quartering  I remember you from gamestop tv a few years back when I used to go there. keep doing your thing  and original lara croft will always be the best croft!
so  they wanted to try and dig up crap on you from the past to get you canned  huh   my friend  if social media was around when I was a teenager  my past mouth would have gotten me in a lot of trouble. lol. yup  I was that bad when I was a teenager. lol.
smart people know how to not apologize for shit they didn t do. I like smart people. you ve earned my subscribe hit.
leave it to gamestop to ruin a good thing. although I have to admit that most of the other hosts were pretty underwhelming. I will miss seeing your smiling face on gstv when Im at work. the current gstv is so boring  in my opinion. just trailers  featurettes and whatnot.Im glad you can be more open and Im super happy you can make content you want to make. your next step is leaving the woke tech companies and moving to more free speech platforms. rumble is a great start. gab is the best social media for free speech. twitter makes money just from you having an account because they sell your info to advertisers and all that. just make sure you tell your followers where youre going.still looking forward to any and all conspiracy theories you may want to talk about  on rumble  of course !
I dont know your other channel yet  but Im here to support you from fb. hang in there  and do your thing!
speak your mind - gain followers. keep on being you.
former sga here  so sad to hear gstv got rid of one of their best hosts. your segments were some of the only things bearable about listening to the loop for 10 hours.
Ive been watching listening to your videos for a little while now and Im just getting to this one.  you ve dealt with so much crap just for speaking your mind  in a respectful manner.  its really a shame.  it is plain as day that youre a good person.  I really dislike that we re at this point now.  cancel culture is a very real thing.  wrongthink is a very  very real thing.
new subscriber from the quartering here  looking forward to your future commentary! also  gina carano and her character on mando are cool af  and laras  old character design was awesome  anybody thatsupports that deserves a like and subscribe  facts!
authenticity attracts authenticity. keep being yourself! if people hate you for it  you dont need them.
hope everything is good. stay true with yourself
loving your gaming  videos I do remember you on gamestop tv now did not know you had youtube love to watch more of your stuff
your a nice person talking good for gamestop with respect thats a true lady with a strong personnality  you have my respect and I promise I stay on your side. keep your good work and stay true to yourself  Im true with myself not the most popular guy but free in my mind with a small group of friend but true friend
for real. if she can look that good at 35  there s hope for all of us to stay young as we inevitably age out the wazzu.
thank you so much
 ....
is gamestop even open anymore   there is no point to buy a game box anymore. all you get is a paper with a link and a code to download it from steam. you dont own the game anymore  like before when you got the disk.
Ive been watching a lot of your videos lately. I just discovered yourecently. one I think its fantastic that you are a Christian and that you put it out there for the world to see. God bless you. two I think that the way that you give your opinions without actually putting people down is awesome. itseems like anymore of the main thing that people want to do when they dont agree with someone is just to go for the throat and tear them apart. that isn t right. thats not how Jesus taught us to be. three I think that you come off as a very strong woman and I respect that. four I like that you grew up with brothers and were a tomboy. I think that gives you a certain understanding of obviously female audience because you are a female  but also male audience because you had a strong male presence in your upbringing. thank you very much and please keep up the good work. I will be subscribing. God bless you and your family. duane.
when I try to picture the guy who complained and tried to get you fired arrested I picture a male wearing leggings  with a man bun with a terribly receding hairline  and is majoring in  gender studies  still trying to get a bachelor degree despite being in his mid 30 s..
I found you due to the quartering.  he is correct  you seem to be a cool person.  I am sorry the woke mob has been coming for you.  I am glad you are doing okay.
well I can honestly say ive never heard of you before but saw jeramys video from the quartering about this video and came to have a listen.glad I did  I agree with most of what you had to say and enjoyed the video keep up the great content you have a new sub here anyway!
came here from the quartering! excited to see where your channel goes and what kind of content you make. it was super cool to hear you quote romans and I was pleasantly surprised. going to check out your other channel too
wow  I dont mean to therapy you  Imean  Ive followed you social medias  twitch and youtube for 11 years now and all Im going to say is  I hope youre ok deep down  like deep deep mentally down  because from what Ive just watched  you are on the verge of a nuclear breakdown and I really hope youre ok. Ive noticed a lot of angry tweets  comments  tiktoks  and other  all I can see is very unhappy person. look after yourself. take some time out and just take it easy and take care.
good to see those subs go up hopefully they keep coming.
this is late but this is frighteningly familiar to collin moriarty s story. the games games  journalism  industry is so crazy right now
forgive me but f  anyone that tries to cancel u. I think ur a sweet and honest person.  Im an old school gamer and I played tomb raider from the day it came out. you have my love and respect.  keep  being u. ull always have support from the ppl that matter.
I owned and or ran comic shops for about two decades. despite popular belief there are and were quite a few female comic book readers. guess what were the two most popular comics to the female customers I had all through the 90 s and 2k s  tomb raider and witchblade. yup  sexy classic lara croft and the tough  sexy  female cop whose clothes got ripped off every time she used her super powers  lol! anything by the late michael turner was usually popular among female readers as well. personally I thought it was for the same reason males like thor and such  these characters represent an ideal people want to imagine being.based on my experience selling entertainment to people I kind of doubt that things like  squirrel girl  and such would appeal to a female audience that much. because the current batch of characters that is attempting to pander to women just aren t sexy. and women like  sexy . they like to be sexy and they like to see sexy. just the way it is. course if you want to make a superhero movie to appeal to women...just have chris evans or come out of the water without a shirt on  lol!
melonie I just found you from jermey from the quartering  I subbed to both your channels because you seem like a cool person. keep being yourself and your fans will have your back.
I didn t knew gamestop had a regular tv show ... Imean I saw they had a december Christmas  twitch stream once when someone I knew said they were hosting it.
glad that your doing this fair winds and good tides fair lady
I still remember  a gazillion years ago  the first time I saw tomb raider. I was in a friend s basement around Christmas time. his dad had the coolest star trek light up decorations on the tree. this kid has it all! I remember thinking his sony playstation made my sega genesis look like a baby s toy. I remember the first level on tr1  jumping around like a madman with inf ammo pistols trying to kill a lion or something. and when I finally got a ps1 of my own tomb raider was the first game I rented from blockbuster. that level with all the platforming and water will forever be burned into my memory! og laura was a Goddess! a powerful force you did not want to fuck with. even as a thirsty 13 year old boy I did not see laura as a piece of meat. but someone who embodies bold and brave characteristics I wished to see in myself. uncompromising  unwavering  strong in mind and ruthlessly intelligent. she was trained educated from childhood to be a total bad ass. the new tomb raider games were great graphically  but they killed her character.the new laura is a caricature of the guilty white feminist and seems to embody all the worst stereotypes of that trope. she s whiny  weak  indecisive  and commands no respect. she s just a basic twitter bitch now... very disappointing. I liked the new games alright  it was not all bad  but I had to pretend this was laura s woke granddaughter or something and not the force of nature I grew up with.
classic lara was such a huge deal back in the day that many girls who were born in that era are called  lara  in my country  even though in my language  hungarian  lara isn t a name. the state actually had to legalize it by adding it to the official list of names due to this phenomenon. guess what  they were mostly named this by their mothers. yes  women named other women  lara  after the busty femme fatale.
I dont even like gaming channels  and I dont simp.. but I support you for what you stand for.. and thats friendship!
loving the channel so far  found out about it via the quartering and looking forward to future videos!
great video! keep up your great work as always. as my favorite and best potus in my lifetime stated   everything woke turns to shit.
this whole cancellation culture is absolutely ridiculous  people should get a life. please keep being yourself  girl!!!
your empathy radar needs checked on because I feel more liberated and happy than I have in soooooo long haha!
@melonie mac go boom  your current content over the last few months says otherwise and are in strong denial  but Im genuinely concerned for you.
yikes! this comment reads like a textbook definition of  concern trolling .
I never even knew gamestoptv existed. I found you when I saw your tweet where you said  bro  Im toxic too . glad I did.
be sure to thank the quartering! Im pretty sure a few of us are here thanks to him
awesome video  so sad you have to deal with this
youre a badass! keep having your own damn opinions. youre ridiculously reasonable and need no guidance from social climbers
Im here following and subscribed. hope things go well for you.  and from the quartering channel.
so good on gamestop for not burning bridges with you and doing things reasonably  good on you for being a perfectly reasonable human being respecting others even when they dont  good on gfuel for not giving a fuck ps  not gonna lie I like your opinions more then your gamestop run  I just thought you were kinda weird  although I only saw there gamesstoptv like every 3 months when I d see what games under 15 were in store
came here from the quartering! been missing you on gamestoptv. do what you do to the glory of God.
these people have so much hate in their heart  they go crazy.
great video melonie and I love your twitch streams!!!
I like when people are authentic
dang  so you had someone try to cancel you  when that was likely not even a thing they called it yet  I remember someone trying to cancel me in 2012  they contacted every black looking fb friend I had with a snip of a raunchy  yet  perhaps reflective comment. it was insane and quite frankly  sorta racist in itself. many were hispanic since I am bilingual. they even emailed and tried to call my  old at the time  boss to try and just pitch a fit and get me fired. I hate that I put him into that frufru situation. he pulled me aside and said  hey  youre likely right but  people cant handle the truth!  so maybe you should just try to not go that extreme again  keep a little in. so I did from then on. I notice contrast.  lol they went all out. it was pathetic. half the people he contacted quietly just ignored it  1 4 unfriended me  and 1 4  so literally like 20 people at least told me  some psycho was out to get you.  it worried me at the time. the freaks weren t out in the open and on display wearing it as they sometimes are now. this dude went all out trying to harass me for probably some stupid stupid hatebait 101  total psyop moment I cant even remember. reflecting in 2022  that was the most cowardly  callous move I d seen anyone make to date bc their argument sucked. things have come so far  now people are brainwashed into thinking that is the regular  henceforth  you have crazy folks acting out in similar fashion even to innocuous comments like yours. people are just something else these days. the phones did something to them  man. some people  Ive learned  dont even have an inner dialogue like  perhaps even a conscience   thats insane. people running around undiagnosed with no capability for empathy. how do those people function  many like that  and more  loud and proud  nowdays. I hope we swing back the other way. I watch cumtown  im gay  and even I think this is a bit much lol.
nice Im glad gamestop were pleasant people. interesting melanie lore. I hopped on the band wagon when I saw the weirdo trying to cancel you because of the lara croft thing. glad you are unfettered  and its cool you feel you can speak your mind and disagree with anyone. let s go boom!
just watched the quartering video and Im here to support the  un-canceling !
Im here from the quartering. but its cool to say that Ive been subbed to your first channel for over 10 years. I cant believe its been a decade already. cheers to the new channel.
also here from thequartering.  glad to see youre large and unafraid   the irony in self-described feminists trying to cancel a woman doing her own thing is palpable.  you do you.
I just tell the employees to play lets plays on the tv and let thatspeak for itself. on the few times theyve done and customers came in they actually had more interest that way.
thank you for talking about the Bible verse in the video! I enjoyed it. so refreshing to see Christian gamers out there like myself!
thanks for taking a stand against the madness !
the quartering sent me here  already use to the cancelation mob the most shocking thing from this though is when you said you were 35 !   literally almost fell out of my chair.
I love that verse romans 8 28 because I believe its true.  God got us no matter what at the end of the day.  also Im new to your channel and for some reason another of your videos popped up on my recommended videos so I started watching some of your videos and came across this one.  its kinda crazy how people can be these days.  with all of that being said you earned my sub.  keep up the great work melonie .
youre hilarious and just overall great! keep up the good stuff! get woke  go broke!
coming over from the quartering. I remember seeing you on gamestop tv. sad to hear that gamestop did that.
here s hoping to see do well on youtube. good luck.
all due respect to gamestop for telling the woke crowd to shove it.
remember  never apologize.
fan-girling was totally acceptable in that moment
looking forward to your content on this channel!
revenge subbed and liked. thanks for standing up to this bs.
just when I wanted to start shopping at gamestop again.I guess thats over now.well at least I can watch content on this channel now.
some people do choose to be that way but they are bI let s be honest about that one xd those were wild times to be sure. I didn t realize you were 35  looking great!the fact they use shit a literal kid said  despite you no longer being a kid or thinking like that tells me and everyone else who has even a single brain cell that this isn t about being right  or morals but about power. and they should be ignored.
found out about your channel from the quartering. congratulations on the new vlog. looking forward to seeing more videos. good luck!
I love your personality  mel
finally people are speaking up!
you dont look a day over 30. continue being you.
like many others came here from the quartering.  itsucks what happened to you with gamestop.  I hate cancel culture.  its bs.   so I liked and subscribed to your channel.
this is going to be big!
any friend of jeremy from the quartering is a friend of pop culture. actual pop culture.p.s.jeremy from geeks and gamers would love to talk to you about these cancel culture weirdos. maybe you could reach out to him for collabs.
I like your style. keeping it real
I actually just found your channel from the quartering. so many of us are tired of this woke or cancelled movement. what happened to we re all allowed to have freedom of speech and thought   freedom of religion  freedom of who your friends with  these same people will tell you its fine but if you do they try to cancel you. its pretty crazy.
girlfriend  you rock!!  on the strength of this video  you just earned yourself a follower
me here  not knowing gamestop tv had existed. yes  my rock has internet and ac.thatsaid  Ive seen some of your more recent videos and its refreshing.
didn t know of you before  but sub after appearances on a few channels like quartering recently. ya pretty entertaining  full of charisma and pretty funny.
love is more powerful than hate. stay strong
heard of your story from thequatering vid  stand for your own views and opinions always  that is a great trait.
top shelf sheila right there   I am coming from jeremy s video about you. you definitely deserve the support for the stance you took. much respect!
motivation! glad you made another channel that you enjoy!
wow  what a journey!  congrats on the new channel.  I subbed  and came over here because jeremy from the quartering gave you a shout out.
heard about you from the quartering.  you have a great spirit about you.  good luck with the new venture.
your dog is so cute! at 29 28 its time for bed. adorable! keep the faith and dont back down! you are an inspiration!
I have a topic for you to cover. I dont know if it will happen this year because of the  c  but the yulin dog meat festival is a horrible thing that happens in china. if you do some research into it  they do some horrible things to the dogs and also cats. its a very heartbreaking subject to learn about  just to warn you. a lot of the youtubers I watch are dog lovers but Ive never seen any of them cover this.
so  Im on the fence about the whole  nature vs nurture  thing for gays. I want to believe people are born with one preference or another  but Ive also personally known many people who were once straight and turned gay randomly in their 20s or 30s. Im not talking about people  coming out  or just coming to terms with it. Im talking about people who were either in long-term relationships or even married to the opposite sex then the relationship went south and they decided they were gay. it even happened to my ex. we were together for 4.5 years  lived together  were engaged  and even were talking about having a kid. after a pretty rough breakup  she went on tumblr and facebook a couple months later saying she was gay. these things make me wonder.
glad the quartering mentioned your channel. keep it up!
18 21 nah you were right. some were born with it  some experimented. but in the end  when they picked a team they made a choice.
thatsucks  funny thing is in their mind getting someone fired for their opinions isn t cancel culture  to them its if that person delete s themselves. which is weird how they go to extremes .
what make me lol is all you hear is we need more women in gaming  people like melonie come along and its  no not like that youre doing it wrong reeeeeeeeeeeee
thequartering sent me and thousands of others  I am now a subscriber and will watch your videos. stick it to the woke!!!! stand together!!!
crazy thing. I used to watch you years ago. I remember watching you being a nerd of tomb raider before you started working with game stop. dont remember why I stopped watching  just any old day to day stuff I guess. anywho glad to see you again xd!!
I only find yourecently through chrissie mayr  I think youre awesome and I ll be watching your channel.

really glad I found your channel  fun stuff  you are beautiful  smart  charming  funny and interesting to watch.
I didn t know you until the quartering commanded me to come and follow your channel  lol. good luck with your channel  you sound like a normal person.
the quartering sent me as part of your reinforcements  subscribed and reporting for duty  ma am!
haters will always watch. will start watching content you post. I subscribed to both channels
the woke cant take a joke. I ll try and comment and like all the videos I watch to push the youtube algorithms in your favor.  it makes it harder for them to cancel you.
wow  Im glad the quartering let us know about you. I look forward to more videos!
I subscribed 3 minutes into this video.   thank you.
just came over from the thequatering!  that was some bad shit that happened stay strong!!

you go  mel! came here after watching the quartering!
nice to meet you and really looking forward to the channel. Im glad the quarterimg recommend you.
about the sponsor   every time they get a call is saying people are watching you and seeing their product.
always love to hear a beautiful success story.
im basically a new follower  less than a year on twatter  and sub to this channel when you announce itim glad I start subed to this channel
the movie thelma and louise was about addressing and debunking female stereo types.the movie ended with them driving over a cliff.irony kills.
I always looked at the cancel culture mob as a gaggle of karen s just waiting to talk to the manager...
its sad that people are trying to tell you who you should be friends with.
people evolve. something that was said over 10 years ago doesnt mean you feel the same now. especially when your a teen. I used to think and say all guys of things in my teens that I would never do now.
welcome to the sane part of yt! looking forward to your future content! p.s. - jeremy says  hi
sent by the quartering. subbed and look forward to seeing how your channel develops.
if you dont know who I am   oh yeah! I remember you from a lara croft sort of ranty video I sent my sister like years ago.  cause she too  although I wouldn t call her a gamer.  she loved tomb raider games  huge fan.  even got herself a ps2 specifially for them.  to her disapointment  since she didn t liked them as much as ps1.  and then later borrowed a 3  and thats when she quit. so I sent her yours and 2 others about how the original lara croft was better and a better icon.  to validate that no  its not just her.  other girls also think the original lara was better.  its not just us the guys because of some  eye candy bs  also  hi!.  good to see you are still kicking.  j shouted you out so figured stop by and see for myself.edit  okay  half way in and Ive already laugh a lot.  you get sub!
I love how youre a real Christian! I have been a Christian for most of my 32 years of life
it isn t just things they dont agree with. if you say anything critical about a game they may love  you get shit. and yes melonie. Im a little older than you. when we grew up people had thick skin and could take a joke.
I remember your channel from years ago with the elfire intro   dark subconscious  cant remember.  anyways way before all this woke culture. glad to see you didn t turn into an npc. I think the timing is perfect for your new channel an your going to have a great year. go hard !
Im glad I found your channel!
the Lord is great. the Lord is good. thank you for sharing. and its super cool how honest you are in this.I get it. I go through the same things.
keep speaking facts God will bless u
quarterpounder sent me. he promised that you d be making daily videos  so thats what Im here for.
that twitter guy. imagine being so hateful that he attacks someone for having a different opinion. then he loses the argument to facts. then instead of maybe doing some self reflection  he doubles down and pulls out every dirty trick in the book. but you have people rallied behind you  a terrible event has now turned into a blessing in disguise.
hope you do well.
the doggo bumping around was hillarious.  liked and scibed as my nephew says.
itsounds like the answer to  why s meloniemac not on gamestop tv anymore   aught to be  there is no gamestop tv.  xd
thank you for fighting the good fight!
while Imay or may not agree with every thing you think  I respect you because you do think
I wish to God these people could get exposed their faces   names
Im here because of jeremy from the quartering. I d encourage you to stay true to who God made you to be. I look forward to plenty of content  and wish you nothing but success on this  your newest endeavor.
Im a straight dude and if gina carano followed me back I would fangirl too.
jeremy sent me
just subscribed after watching the quartering s shout out  looking forward to your videos!
be blessed  rare are the one quoting the Bible. much respect. good content btw  if it was not for the quartering  I would ve miss some talented commentary stuff  3
friends are like a  holes...everyone has one some smell and some are clean. stick with the clean ones...you are better off  george carlin
subscribed to your new channel  I saw the quartering talking about how cancel culture was trying to silence you   I wanted to come support you.
here from jeremy s channel and the video he done about you  and ... Im subbed! cant wait to hear your perspectives.
this channel s already lit lol. I think my mac cherry was popped on a hammerwatch review.. been with ya ever since. ended up buying   loving hammerwatch too so thnx
God bless you  sister    never back down  never apologise for your faith  preach the word and walk with the Lord without embarrassment or compromise and he will strengthen  protect  and bless you. keep sharing Bible verses  your thoughts and beliefs  and watch an audience who appreciate and love that truth and honesty grow. from a brother in Christ.
love the needler in the background   I witnessed all the backlash of fb and other platforms. it was all pretty annoying.
its a sad world where all social media has the public as your boss effectively.  corporate structure needs to ignore public opinions and just get on with making whatever they want to make and let people have their private life.
your videos just recently showed up in my feed. really diggin your vibe  you just got a sub
you are a youtuber Im allowing my daughters  14  12  11  9  watch without hesitation.greetings from osaka japan.
but melonie!!  you are only allowed to have your own opinions if they are the ones that we prescribe for your own good.  empowerment is real.
learned from the quartering what they re trying to do to you.. here showing support
I would like to hear your opinion on some of the upcoming games for any system. one is particular because I am kinda on the fence about is fire emblem engage.
hang in there. bless you.
adversity makes us stronger and  more often than not  wiser. itsucks  but its not all negative. it just feels like it in the moment.
this world has gone absolutely insane
this channel is gonna blow up
for the algorithm from the quartering. you are a very wholesome and refreshing personality!
hold tight  g4tv will be looking for new staff any day now.

you rock for speaking your mind! also  you may not see yourself as a feminist  but you stand up for yourself and anyone being bullied into following the crowd. thats more feminist than any of these woke sjws. keep on trucking melonie!
remembered your channel since the 2013 era  glad you didnt turn into another woke youtuber like most these days.
u got ur feet on the ground girl  u got my sub
ignore the woke libs ur awesome and keep doing ur thing
anyone else forget that gamestop tv was a thing
my little sister  back in the mid 90 s was a sucker for the first tomb raider game  and also samus from metroid  and yes  of course she loved their design with tight suits showing feminine curves.
glad you got out of that dying husk of a company. just expose them within your legal limits
we need more melonie mac in the gaming industry and less  or zero  of others  such as well I wont name names but Im sure we all know who.
boom! boom! boom! bring it on! thank jeremy from the quartering  he pointed me to you  but you earned my subscription  so keep speaking truth. see ya on rumble too! good luck!
came here from the quartering and Im gonna subscribe to your channel.fuck cancel culture!  banned from most social media platforms here
you rock my friend! gonna fly to the top!!!!!
new subscriber here! never not record these without your g-fuel! you are crunk and I dig it!!! good stuff!!
social media is a poison.
a little bird  let s call him the quartering  said you had a new channel and you were getting dragged by a bunch overly sensitive fools. Im looking forward to seeing the channel grow.
love that u made a channel just for this melo! but could u pls turn the volume up
I wish more people would realize that giving into the woke mob just makes thing worse.
truly beautiful personality and woman.  just discovered ya thru the quartering.  God bless
Im 8 months late watching this video but I still wanna point out tht ur a smart girl by leaving gamestop gs is a kaboom waiting to blow-up
Im asexual and Ive been kicked out of  ace spaces  and other lgbt-ish places for not having extreme-left politics.  minority status  doesnt matter. its all about thought control and if you are a minority with the wrong take they ll come at you just as hard as any so-called  huwhyte supremacist . stay strong and stay hard.
here from the quartering.  best of luck  I sincerely hope this leads to better things for you.

hello fellow ace. Ive had the same happen to me. I didn t get kicked out but I dont hang around ace spaces because of I dont have the politics.
@priyana varma  aces high!
yes  the og queen is back.
youre a doll.  glad jeremy sent me this way!
oh man  you were that gamestop broad on all the tvs  ! lol thats awesome
holy shit youre a pureblood too  how am I just finding this channel  I had very similar experiences as a dev  it was sad watching the industry roll over for the woke crowd  relentless politicizing of everything and literally blacklisting people who disagree. Ive always been perfectly happy to be blacklisted anywhere that would blacklist me for my opinions. besides that political movement is only like 5  us pop tops  they re just loud. you made the right call  its way more fun and meaningful to say what you think and actually connect with people. glad I found your channel.
thequartering got me here but you earned my sub  I really enjoyed your content.  best of luck on your future endeavors.
you are amazing  thank you.
I didn t know you existed until I saw a video by the quartering  thought it was wrong what happened to you so I am subbing to help out.
I followed you an instagram since a long time already  didn t know you had a channel so far but yeah  here I am !
this is why my attempt to start my own gaming channel stalled 5 years ago.all the drama and politics and just hate culture on steroids. until fallout 4pissed me off so much I decided I was going to do what I wanted to do nomatter who complained. of course I also got smart and restarted under adifferent brand hahaha
I subbed to philly d for about 8 years  but I ended up blocking him about 4 or 5 years ago. he s been in calI for it too long
I just saw jeremy s video and he suggested to give you a shot. wonderful dude and he showed me the wonderful trillium  so I trust his judgment. welcome to youtube  as well as  Im sorry youre here on youtube . gamestop is a dying brand  so its good you found something different whether your choice or their force. ugh! typical c.c. bologna from twitter mobs when you dont toe the line. you cant be an independent wahmen jeremy word  unless you say what they want you to say and think they way they want you to think. please stay strong and you do you.       -topics  Im sure the base audience here can agree  game related news information  twitch hot-takes silly moments from you or friends streams  and thoughts on pop culture politics would cover a big broad brush of content.       - jeremy in his video said  in a challenge to you  to be consistent on uploads. however that man is a beast and uploads  as well as  works just so insanely hard. I doubt anyone can match his energy or commitment
haters gonna hate. stay true to yourself better  things will come your way.
never heard nor saw gamestop tv.  you must be more popular now.  haha.
youre 35 ! wow  you look like youre in your mid to upper 20s! you also look healthy too. keep it up!
this is a pleasant surprise   I came here cuz jeremy pointed me on this direction. however he sometimes talk to much politics on videos that  in my opinion dont really have nothing to do with it and from time to time he goes a bit loco. you seem to be more neutral in most things so I subscribed and will keep an eye on your content.. you have great energy  are well spoken not only using buzzwords and on top of that good looking so I hope you succeed
you just got a new sub. never been the knee to the woke crowd.
came over from the quartering. best of luck cant wait to see where this rollercoaster goes.
yeah about the latest gamestop fiasco screw them thats wrongful termination and a couple other things also highly illegal! I hope you get your new job sorted out soon Godspeed.
it is hard learning about some of your friends.  check out a video by td jakes about  three types of friends   he nails it.  good luck with the new gig.
good luck with your new channel  many thanks.
friend of the quartering. keep up the amazing work!
just showing some support for independent thought  I wasn t crazy about the last iteration s depiction of lady croft either. Im so sick of  brie larson  syndrome. resist the slave mind at all costs.
stay strong out there
I want you to know that I appreciate you very much! I know tomb raider because of my mom and because of following you it inspired me to buy her old console with old tomb raider games because she loved lara and the old games with her and because she never learn how to use pc  p
you canthank the quartering for my follow and giving you a try to see what your about I never seen game stop tv just cause its game stop I wouldnt have ever watched it I dont care what some corp saysim picky on what gaming content I watchas in channels I wont watch cause seem to corp like as in that one like angry joe but channels thatseem real down to earth I will watch
go boom indeed. youre gonna s plode. looking forward to your many videos to come. Imiss the original lara too.
subscribed.  people that jump on this high horses are ridiculous.  people have different things to say about topics.  if people dont talk and exchange ideas we would be stuck in the dark ages. that is why we have free speech in the constitution.
you had me at  buuutt .
the sword of truth cuts deep.
gaming industry loves melanie
the cancel crowd are why we need banana clips and drums.
I enjoy when content creators are open  and its sad that people like the ones who came at you  kinda ruin content like that..
you are one of my favorite people to watch! also I am calling the police on you for this video lol
additionally .itseems it was pablo hidalgo s decision alone to create the shitstorm that disney would never rehire gina while actual executives at disney dont didn t hold that position and thats one of the reasons pablo hidalgo no longer works for lucasfilm or disney.
you look younger now than when you worked for gamestop tv. how
I always thought that the trilogy was like a prequel to the og lara croft  but she just didn t seem to progress to that tomb raider we all know and love. she was a completely different person.
hey melonie  you should get together with geeks   gamers  they mentioned you on a stream recently and they seem like a cool group to hang with.
I sent gamestop social media a screenshot of one of ur ig tirades. told them I had a hornets nest in my backyard they could kick after they done with you .
let your haters be you motivators you rock!!!
make no apology! say what you mean and mean what you say!
6 35 bruh  so this is how a simp is born
I d totes be down!
 .....
im glad youre one of the good guys.  rational free thinker the progressives hate.
found your channel from the quartering  cool setup so far  I subed and wish you all the best!
where were you when melonie no longer has contract with gamestop  at home eating brain soup pyotr calls me up  melonie is no longer have contract with gamestop   no
u should really join geeks and gamers. Im sure they would love to have you on for the mario kart stream and part of their team!
what happened with colin moriarty was a damn shame and the guy has the number one ps podcast now. talented ppl will find their way.
d crush those mindless zealots  lady! I didn t get the poke either and Im a puny 40 pound cripple that a common cold can easily slay. I appreciate your support for my choice.
I have a new and deeper respect for you. I hope God blesses you stay strong. remember Jesus loves you.
if you have influence if any kind and you have a different view they want youremoved. honestly the internet has been the home to a bunch of weirdos who need a life.
15 28 ahahahah  voice of reason  -  twitter  .... insert well there s yer prawblem! meme here xd good Lord. Im literally thinking of deleting my twitter because I thought I d try it for a year or so and see if there s any point. 90  of what I see on that hellscape is toxic at best. I follow you  and mara jade  and some others in a similar space  and thats about it. any time you try to engage with the crazies  or bring nuance to a discussion  the woke mob jumps down your throat because ironically  the only see things in black and white. also they re obsessed with race but thats another issue lol. I literally gain very little from using twitter  and it opens you up to an insane amount of potential negativity from these woke warriors behind their phones who are total pussies irl but try to bully and harass people online to feel better about their shitty lives. its pathetic but fully encouraged and enabled by twitter as long as you have the right politics. doesnt matter if youre a black trans quadriplegic  if youre not a far left nutjob with it too  youre still up for bullying  harassment  doxxing  and cancellation.
well if these lunatics  have tried cancelling you this many times you must be my kind of person  lol
after learning more about you... I really like you. there aren t many  escuse this   e-girls  who are real people with souls and after learning you have faith  assuming in Christ  Im left flabbergasted cause that makes you a rarity of rarities in a really good way. the world is so degenerate and falling apart in so many ways that itstarts to weigh heavy on me but your very existence is hope raising.
you seem kewllllllll. I ll be tuned in for future vids  you ll do awesome.
I stumbled upon these videos and I realized her voice dramatically changed  naturally I think   over just a 1-2 months. wtf
not sure if you will read this  but I just found you through the simpcast. I haven t watched all of your content  but what I have seen thus far is high quality. I haven t heard you say anything yet that I disagree with  although I do have a slight addendum to what you said about sexual attraction being a choice. like you  I dont believe that people have control over who they are sexually attracted to  and thus sexual attraction isn t a choice. however  everyone has a choice of who they engage in relationships with. we all have our struggles with temptations  and the Bible listed sexual temptation  lust   right along with things like envy  greed  gluttony  and pride.also  you were discussing the age of the earth evolution on the simpcast and you should look into living tissue found in  dinosaur  fossils. they cantry to claim the earth is millions  or was that billions  of years old  but for there to be living tissue inside of fossils  those cant be more than 100k years old.
my name is on that list. not my name name of course. back then  when I was still on twitter  I only logged in on a burner phone behind a vpn at a mcdonald s hotspot with an anonymous account. ain t nobody canceling me in 2026 for stuff I said 10 years earlier.
original lara croft was great. seems like there are a lot of people who ve gotten positions in the comics and gaming industry who dont like attractive women  either through jealousy  personal insecurities  etc.
quoting the Bible! ! on youtube! ! ! man  I gotta subscribe now. you go girl.
didn t know of you until I saw you with the drinker  and here I am  for what its worth   so I raise a glass to you young lady  welcome to the cheap seats.
several influences let itslip that big pharma offered to pay a lot of money to youtubers who push certain medical procedures.
jeremy sent me youre way. subscribed and good luck on the new channel.
so  a guy thats never seen a vagina  calls you a misogynist... makes sense.. I didn t mind the  reboot  of laura though  the game felt more..  real  I guess. more immersive..I know it was supernatural and all that  but still the reactions felt more  human  less superhero.. outside of her not dying from that rebar in the first game lol. and you should upload on rumble too!
jeremy said I d like it here..... he was right    great video !!  speak your mind!!! be proactive vocally with your opinion always!! prov 3 5-6
fan of the quartering midwestly here showing some support with a like and a subscribe.  keep on keeping on!
dont know about what all these dang kids on my lawn are saying about pick-me s  but I think the world needs more of them doing cool stuff. came from the main channel recommendation  but I originally came from a shout-out from a channel I dont follow anymore. subbed  but I cant ring the bell because my dinosaur of a phone doesnt have room for the actual app.
glad I found your new channel
found the channel from the quartering  looking forward to the new vids!
gotta support the quartering s fam
there s no greater hive of scum and villainy than twitter.
another sub here via the quartering - freedom of speech all the way!
I did not know gamestop had a channel
I joined because the quartering  jeremy  backs you. stand firm girl.I love the attitude.
I saw a video about you on thequartering.I look forwarded to seeing more of your videos!
sent from the quartering excited to see your content!!!
jeremy says show you love. I show you love!
quartering sent me here  keep being real!
rofl!  good stuff  mac.
here from the quartering  good luck melanie. subscribed
I had read somewhere what they did to you. then the quartering tweeted something about it  others did too.to be honest   its not easy for me to understand how someone like you could even communicate with these awful people  some of whom betrayed you   sadly ...I cant stomach these people.we can be people of science   religious or otherwise   be wholly antI sexism and anti-rac1sm and still not be as toxic  dangerous and intolerant as these leftists are.fortunately  you survived the battle against wokeism.
they tried to cancel you and here you are  gaining nee subs lolthe wuartering sent me. subbed!
wow  they came after you for a lot of stuff. but I remember someone on gamestop tv touted being able to play as both leon and claire as a new feature in the resident evil 2 remake  and I bet that I couldn t find a peep about that.gamestop tv sucks now. its just a bunch of streamers and youtubers shilling. the worst has to be the guy with the camera right in his face who shills madden.
its interesting how things people said years or even decades earlier should be used to ruin you by people who dont even know you... unless of course you are a hard core sjw  in those cases everyone is supposed to understand that the person has  grown as a person since then . they are so simple minded they dont even see how hypocritical they are.
here from the quartering. sorry about what happened. we got you.
hey  @thequartering recommended your channel. ignore the crazies. good luck with the new channel.
I agree with you about lara croft Imiss the old design
I didn t know you used to host for gamestop tv  didn t know that was a thing. but sounds dope..wana hangout and do a couple lines of g fuel later
God bless you and your cat.
a time is coming when men will go mad  and when they see someone who is not mad  they will attack him  saying   you are mad  you are not like us.-st. antony the great
you should talk to the guys from geeks gamers they are dominating the gaming space right now...
just heard about you from the quartering so I thought I d check your channel out  Im glad I did.
this is a great first video at 2 18 so far
I wasn t sent here by the quartering  but I subscribed after seeing the vid about you being fired. I dont care for the labeling of politics and liberal or conservative. but using those and my own  Im a secular moderate independent thinking caring white guy. and since you mentioned it  istandwithaginacarano.
g day from australiaI jumped over from the quartering!!!big fan of open opinions.good luck mate!!!!
youre 35 !!! wtf are you  nosferatu or something !! were you bitten when you were seventeen or something ! damn girl  you look terrific for your age! you must thank your parents daily for those awesome genes they blessed you with!
1 door closes and another will open. keep that p.m.a. positive mental attitude. it ll get you through hard times.
25 40 good call. 5head play  mel.
@melonie mac go boom in my opinion you are a real heroin and a pioneer for free speech.for me you are a rollemodel for most modern day woman.you speeking the truth that all self thinking self empowerd indivituals think anyway.if its also in your interest I would love to see a lara craft cosplay  of you.do you have an instagram account God bless you
I wish everyone were as grounded as you in regards to these woke shit views!  the voice of reason  melonie mac!
here per the quartering s recommendation.  screw the cancelers.   1 sub added to fight the fight.
I came here from thequartering and Im not disappointed so consider myself subbed
original lara was best lara. everyone has their preferences. when it comes to culture and content  we like what we like. never settle  never compromise and never apologize.
isn t it amazing that people so worked up over someone s opinion that isn t in line with their way of thinking. my advice is be honest and factual  dont quote unsubstantiated rumors or information. of course it works for some folks  so best of luck to you and I will be checking in.
here from @thequartering channel! I d love to subscribe  especially after everyone trying to cancel you! God bless
saw what happened on the quartering. total bullshit but not completely surprising to me. subbed  keep it going.
popped over here from the quuartering. looking forward to seeing your new content!!!
youre going to have to get a copy of the thesaurus that the quartering uses.jeremy is one of the most graceful dancers on youtube.
the quartering brought me here to subscribe.  I shall not disappoint epic beard man.
jeremy sent me here.  1 sub for you. I will look forward to many more videos to come.
if it makes you feel any better  you were one of two females worth watching on gstv  all the rest seemed like posers. thats not just my opinion  the great majority of people  across four or five gamestop stores  Ive worked with felt the same way.
hey gurl! reach out to geeks and gamers to see if you can do a colab. Im sure they ll love to chat with you.
commenting for the algorithm--sorry you had to deal with lunatics  hoping this turns into a massive net positive for you in the future.
for anyone who kept up with the buyout of I think the us branch of square enix did embracer group give control back to square enix with tomb raider or are they making a new one Im very confused by that Ive heard that there s like a rumor of a remake again but I was assuming they were going to remaster like the original trilogy I know that probably wont happen now but Im just confused by that point
the only people who incessantly gripe about lara croft being curvy and sexy are women who cant be that and men who cant get that.its always the case.
how insane does somebody have to be to think following gina carano will ruin somebody s life
eff woke culture  gamestop s loss. looking forward to some good content  shoutout to thequartering
what do you think the cult part in the cult of woke means
oh no  a voice of reason will get you cancelled! what s that phrase again  I stand in solidarity with you  I wont do anything other than make thatstatement though  but I know I look completely virtuous in doing so.  in all seriousness  it looks as though you went through  a lot  of crap but stood your ground in what you believe is right. what youre doing is a far more accurate display of bravery than what some of those toxic groups say are.
I think people get  tolerance  and  indifference  mixed up.
good on gfuel for respecting freedom of speech.  shame the entertainment industry decided it was more important to cancel humanity in favor of the lizard people and dont work as hard to entertain  generally speaking of course.
when you just hear like 100 different people all saying the exact same phrase  and all having the exact same retorts  you know those people are not thinking. those people are programmed.
glad I found your channel.  you give me hope for your generation   non-woke  have morals  call a spade a spade.
I once caught my brother playing tomb raider on pc with the naked cheats on lol. kinda ruined the franchise for me.
Im a girl  mostly straight  and even I like to look at pretty and shapely women.
was brought here by the quartering  staying for the Bible verse usage at the end. good stuff.
Im surprised youre 35  I haven t seen anything from you before discovering your channel  but I thought you were in your 20s.
Ive been a huge fan of lara croft and samus for decades now. so its rather hilarious when I see individuals saying there s no strong female characters in gaming. there s plenty more than that obviously. but I digress. lol
to be rigorously honest with me being a empathetic   sympathectic person I was sincerely saddened to hear you talk about your experience of how people you cared about   that you thought were your friend s turned against you. but I was so glad for you to hear you speak of how you were still very adamant about your stance on thing s   that you weren t going to back down   change your perspective. and Im very glad to see that in the end this negative experience you didn t deserve inadvertently made you an  overall  stronger person. in every negative there is a positive. and for you to have found that is great.
recommended by jeremy...  enjoying so far.
bruh what. I subbed after watching that great Lord of the rings  rings of power hot take  and later on ran into this vid in my recommended. cant believe this story about gamestop and tomb raider is real lol. I can however  unfortunately believe the whole woke crowd cancel culture happened.if its any consolation  your content was worth the sub on its own to someone who was ignorant to this whole story - I enjoy both the quartering and shoeonhead but their coverage didn t bring me here... must ve missed those vids -  so this channel definitely has a future standing on its own amidst this whole gamestop situation.
you  shoe on head  june   and alannah pearce rule.
nolI illegitimI carborundum  jeramy says hi.
you look awesome for 35!!! I would have guessed you were in your 20 s!
jeremy sent me. glad he did! subscribed.
its nice to see you stand your ground  Im a nobody and another face in the crowd but imo ppl that attack Christian or catholic or even just a general  good person never have truth or facts on there side and they all are a pact mentality  a have mind they never think for them selves and they are like parrots saying the same things over and over and all the racist and bad name calling is basically losing there meaning when they say it  sorry for rambling but keep up the good work mel  and I agree you are a women thatshould be a role model for young women. nothing but love from canada and I stand with america patriots. keep fighting the good fight all.
holy shit I thought I recognized you I didn t realize you were that melonie! o
4 12 doesnt work in the gaming industry anymore. hmm. I wonder why.be yourself. I know its hard on most platforms these days where you need a law degree to understand the tos  but most audience are attracted to genuine personalities.besides  what s the fun in living life if you have to constantly cater to other people s ideologies
youtube promoted your new channel is how I saw this.  I like the name.  but  melonie mac go nuclear  crossed my mind.  I guess irl is overused for a second channel.  also I thought you are starting this new channel because of your successful podcast with chrissie mayr on her channel.  you nailed it  all the fem-nonsense in under 10 minutes.
is that a for king and country hoodie  I like it.
selfishness is moral. the only rational ethics ever discovered was one based on selfishness.
your hawaiian anime shirt ad you did sticks in my head
I feel like you could call the video something along the lines of  how cancel culture affected my time at gamestop tv  since youreally only talked about why you left for about a minute max. Im not saying the video was bad by any means  it was very interesting to hear about your experiences even if I dont agree with all your opinions  but just that the title really didn t go with most of what you talked about in the video. but those who just tried to get you cancelled over any little thing really need to get a life
Imay not agree with some things you say but I ll die to protect your right to say them. we re all unique individuals. we re not clones with matching thoughts and ideas. the world would be a boring place if we all agreed on things.you shine your own torch and never let anyone else dim its light.
the quartering told me to come watch.  I will keep watching to see if this is a channel I want to sub to.
the opposite of compromise is character.  - frederick douglasswoke npcs comply and obey  they are programmed to force others to comply and obey or the will attempt to cancel people.
hI  the quartering sent me. much love  stay strong.
okay  I cannot stand fried onions. but if someone changed how fried onions looked  I wouldn t care. but. to these people  changing how a beautiful woman looks is.... hatred  how can you hate woman and care if they re hot or not at the same time    words seriously mean nothing to these people!
glad you have come back to God  I know since I have come back to the truth that things have gotten more difficult  I have keep from all the selfish decisions and way of life I was able to live before. knowing Jesus is worth all of it  may you grow to a richer and greater understanding of God and best of luck with your continued career!  blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
I came for the based hot gamer chick.more power to you keep it real
friends for a decade  hugh this world is rotten  human interactions should be simple. civilisations have ended for less.amen. an awomen.
I never understood gamestop tv you can only watch it at a gamestop they were not on twitch or youtube making money and a lot of the time the host and everything seems robotic and bland
ehhhh  regarding the mandate  if the disease wasn t a  contagious and b  didn t require hospital resources if it got bad  then yeah  all the more power to ya. but I viewed the mandate as a  please do what you canto not infect others and b  if you do get infected  do what you can so that you wont take up a hospital bed that might be needed for someone else with a different condition. aka  please be a team player .  beyond that  its basically a case of  let others live . some people have nothing better to do with their time than go after random individuals. such is life.
excuse me while I simp for a moment.  I think you have fantastic eyes!  keep up the good work!!!!
followed jeremy s link here. subbed  keep it up
waitso if Im a guy that likes the original he-man does that make me an internalised misandrist
I agree with everything except for the mandate thing but you did not deserve all that drama
9 38 __jeramy of the quartering is a  casual racist  my grandma is also  they say things about other races in suddle casual ways mixed with half truth ...they are not necessarily bad people ...however u most be wise not to allow someone else s words to control your life -- least become forever in debt to someone else s priceless advice
I think melonie speaks for a large audience and especially right wing people like myself. we just get tired of all the bullshit. I totally respect thatshe grew up a tomboy
he tried to have melonie mac killed by committed crime of swatted.
classic laura is so cool. this whole bizarre thing to make her  strong normal woman  is so nonsensical to me because she s literally the original. she s curvy and kicked ass and did it with an attitude! literally the same vibe bayonetta went for. when these people rant about her being  sexy  its so wild to me. who cares if men find her attractive  are they not allowed to  can we talk about all the women who find her attractive  the women who look at her like the power fantasy she could be interpreted as  the only  empowerment  these people want is to scream about it to change for them. thats the power fantasy here. narcissism. relatable moment  Ive been called  straight  as an insult so many times because I dont jive with identity politic stuff. these same people will preach about women and gay men mattering  and then as soon as any of them disagree with their politics suddenly those women and gay women do not matter. its sad  sad business these times.
late to the video. with all sincerity  keep up your good work.
you need to replace frosk on g4!
most people taking up hospital beds were  are obese  so are you ok with a calorie restriction mandate by chance
@melonie mac go boom  you hit the nail on the head there. as far as  calorie restriction mandates  go  how would that even  work   oops  you ate 2500 calories today. youre not allowed to go to your kitchen.   or  your bmI is above 30  you have to pay an extra  300 in taxes this year    other developed nations like the ones in the eu and japan are more physically fit  in part at least  because the design of their cities and countries on a whole lend themselves much better to methods of transportation which involve physical activity  such as walking and biking. the netherlands are famous for this  for instance. in contrast  in the united states  for our transportation  its  sit your ass down in that car   which means a much more sedentary lifestyle.thatsaid  I d love to see some sort of healthcare incentives  just...I have no idea how that d actually  work .thatsaid  as far as fitness goes  Im 5 5  165ish  and my father was morbidly obese. in contrast  youre a fitness guru  so I feel like the more I write  the more I d be lecturing a fish on how to swim  so...yeah  _
I dont think people choose who they are attracted to  but I also dont think anyone is born gay either. homosexuality is definitively a struggle  but it can be overcomed. God doesnt make anything a sin that you cant control. its not easy  but its possible.edit  we cant always control our thoughts or feelings  but you can always control your actions. a break through is when your thoughts finally align with the right choices  but it takes practice   patience like everything else
and thats why the frost got her company bankrupt and she got fired
your make up is very good this video. keep this style up!
unless youre chris jericho  you cant have a list  lol
as a black male veteran from the south... no its not a lead in for a joke lol. I get soooo many white women  the most  that try to tell me what I should be offended by. they get super angry when I refuse to play along with the woke delusional junk. now I find it very entertaining .
itsounds like you have a similar story to sargon of akkad he just wanted to game and they kept pushing
good luck! stay the course
I love it how a man told you your misogynistic.gonna be missing gina from mando s3. wish they d surprise us like they did with luke. cara dune just walks in out of nowhere. the coordinated attack on rogan is ridiculous. smells of desperation. man  Im glad there was nothing recording me when I was 17.
screw that people on video games need to grow the hell up Ive run into too many people going.  I want to play a team game where we use communication but Im not gonna communicate nor play with others and get mad at anybody that points this out.
I didn t mind nu-lara s design too much. she still looked pretty good. and that voice. mmm  she got a great voice . I did dislike the fact that 3 games in and she still feels just as helpless and pathetic as she did in the first game  basically stumbling her way through her games. thats not lara croft. lara croft is a badass  confident sexy adventurer. its actually kind of sad. instead of making a strong independent woman  they took someone who already was that and made her the opposite.
your hawaiI shirt ad was ridicules lol. thank you for your time at gamestop
check out geeks gamers  the hijabI gamer  nerdrotic for friday night tights  and chrissie mayr. Im sure a few of them would love to promote you and interview you as you make your own way as a youtuber.
wow imagine being cancelled for being your own person and having opinions. and there are things I agree and not agree on  but who ever agrees with everything someone else says. I dont always agree with jeremy  and Im fairly sure I wont agree with everything you say either. the difference is I can live with that and maybe have a conversation about it. Im not about to cancel people for  wrong think
new subscriber here I found your channel through the quartering.
no one gives a crap what wokies think except them  I subscribed because of what you said about tomb raider since it mirrors what I think plus your cute.
the people who whine the most about karens on social media are the absolute worst karens alive when someone dares to disagree with them. ironic. I d call it hypocritical  but whether they realize it or not  inconsistency is the whole point. its called repressive tolerance.
in before this channel takes off.  remember us when youre famous.
if g4 would have hired you instead of that frosk chick  they d still be around! btw  loved you on fnt!
was recommended by the quartering.  interested in your opinions.
Im not a gamer  so I wasn t aware of who you were until a video of you dunking on she hulk came up  and I found you highly entertaining. I would like to say that the gaming industry is completely nuts for pushing people like you out  and bringing in lame wokesters. it makes no sense. you clearly capture an audience and people enjoy listening to you. weareas most of the woke personalities are basically foisted on us against our will. this is just poor business. years into this culture war  I still cant fathom how companies choose to alienate the majority of their customer base like this  and take all the fun out of everything. looks like its their loss though.
homosexuality is definitively a struggle  but it can be overcomed.  I prefer that everyone mind their own business as long as each individual dont flaunt on the streets
@ultimate vexation   flaunt it on the streets parades during pride month
agreed
not getting the ... is similar to not wearing a seatbelt. its endangering yourself  depending on how you live of course  but there s also a chance your airborne corpse will fly through the windshield and wipe out half a nursing home. people are free to make the choice for themselves  but people saying there s no benefit to people  or their immediate community  are not truthful.
welcome to gaming community happy 64th anniversary of the video game industry   1958   2022   and congratulations your 1th youtube channel buddy
glad to see Im not the only one that prefers classic lara croft over the new one.  she was just a more fun character  personality wise  than the current version.  the new version takes itself way too seriously.I didn t get  the treatment  either.  my body  my choice  right   at least  that was the saying before the pandemic.these woke people  especially the ones trying to cancel you  have no purpose in life  other than thinking that they can give themselves purpose by raising themselves up... by tearing someone else down.  thats all they have to live for.  Im glad you never apologized.  an apology to these people is nothing more than a confession of wrongdoing.  they d just hammer you more.  they ve never forgiven anyone who apologized.and finally... you surprised me when you said youre 35.  I honestly thought that you were in your early 20 s.  then again  Ive always been bad at guessing ages.
12 06 super hilarious
Im probably in the minority  but I actually prefer the square enix alicia vikander lara croft. the over-the-top  mission impossible style never resonated with me  but the new tomb raider feels like a spiritual successor to indiana jones in a way  and I really wished there was a better  mantle  of the indiana jones and until there is  lara croft more than makes up for it.
its so strange to hear people have tried to cancel women who game over their opinions on the female form in gaming. Ive complained about some of it in the past. I ll own it. I really disliked the depiction of women characters who s waists were smaller than their biceps and breasts were watermelons. Ive found female armor problematic for world building where a man s vital areas are fully protected and women have pasties. but I get it. I d like more attractive men in games.
consider yourself subbed.  you canthank the quartering  d
your tweets from 17 years old were true...we ve been brainwashed to believe differently.  humans absolutely can choose who they re attracted to...its not always a conscious choice...but there is far more evidence for this than anyone s come up with to prove anyone is  born that way .I think its hilarious they fight this idea...if there s nothing wrong with it  why are they so ashamed to admit its a choice
not surprising h3ll they tried to cancel john wayne and he not even alive to defend himself.
I follow the quartering but it doesnt mean I agree with everything he says or stands for. its call everyone can have their own voice and opinion.
honestly  I never liked gamestop tv. it was mostly obnoxious propaganda that made my shopping experience more painful than it needs to be. I d rather shop at a game store that only had games playing on the tv  and not a bunch of stupid commercials that make me want to cringe. if gamestop didn t air that crap  and maybe have a better approach  to giving cash back that benefits the consumer more than the store  I would shop there more often.
here from the quartering to show you support.
anyone that rails against this idiotic modern social narrative gets my vote  and sub   my hope is  there is enough of us to return to some sense of  normalcy  one day. its important to have women leading the charge  as it is feminism thatseeks to chain us all. I am in complete agreement with you on the lara croft character  there is absolutely nothing wrong with being classically attractive while  kicking ass  and that applies to all forms of entertainment.
saw the quartering video and some of the other people whose channels you were recently on. subbed.
dont wory about gamestop. they aren t the same anymore. youre not missing anything. in like 2-5 years  gs wont even be a thing anymore.
why would any man confront a woman about her preferences as a woman. I have played online games with females before who always opted for the super feminine character appearance. as for the attacks  these people make claims of compassion for select groups  yet are some of the most hateful on the internet. so many of them seem to be emotionally broken.
wait. you hosted gamestop tv  I worked there for 11 years. made me want to die.
actually quiet sad that you have to make a 2nd channel to voice your opinion on whatever...  cancel culture  and the apparently almighty presence of people that are unable to stand opinions that differ from their own  is such a mind blowing thing nowadays. what happened to free speech  tolerance and discussion culture  I dont know.sad times where people prefer intolerance  meltdowns  quick judging and unchangeable convenient opinions over serious conversations  empathy and openness...you do you girl! best you can do.
if there s a list for liking lara croft s boo-tay  consider me public enemy number one..
on the  selfish  topic.legally everyone has the right to refuse. he has the right to his opinion.they have the right to call out his opinion.imoselfishness is relative to intent and blanket statements should be avoided. ethically. if your stance for not getting it is  I ll be fine   then yeah  thats a bitselfish  and possibly misguided. mind you there are valid reasons for not getting it.hopefully I came across respectfully.
I think if all the information ever comes out about how the ... were developed  and how the public health and government people handled it from even before 2020  some people might change their opinions. I do not agree that they are similar to wearing seatbelts. I think that is not an apple to apples comparison.
haters gonna hate. hes not being an alpha.
wow thanks to the quartering for sharing your new channel you seem interesting I watched some other videos
I  love  how when a woman doesnt toe some feminist gamer line  she ends up getting accused  by a man  of having  internalized misogyny .  ....... freakin  clown world.like  how freaking dare you have your own unique thoughts  interests and ideas! feminist law decrees that you must like the new laura croft and that you must despise the old version! no massive pixel-y polygon chests for you!   and get back in the ceo s office  woman!  not sure if this joke reads properly  but Im leaving it in. its a twist on the  get back in the kitchen...  line  but from some  feminist ally  who is still trying to be controlling  but doesnt seem to notice but for real  I d say that dude has a severe case of  externalized  misogyny.. and the worst case of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!
never change
10 23 not approved woke narrative  lady with a corporation like this they do not want to loose money and risk offending a wide audience by ones actions  as your their to sell games  their worried that your offending their customer base based on the complaints only to find it was a difference of opinion and someone went off their rocker about it like the child that they areits a matter of policy vs a matter of opinion in the same way an openly joking and forceful salesmen would get called into the office to be told to knock it off as your scaring the customers awayprofessionalism vs openism about who one is  one has its place there  and the other another.hell their was a really great actor who every time he was asked about his opinion about anything he would just retort Im an actor  I act  that is all and he didnt want to be worshipedand God knows we need more of those............ hell you wonder what s gone wrong with the world its the lack of that  professionalism and the respect of othersand they thought you were doing that instead of just trying to make basic interactions with people  only to hitsuch trigger words and subjects that they kept getting constant blowback about it.also why were you using your actual name when interacting with the quartering to begin with  couldnt you have used a separate account and let him know who it was that way  and kept the communications hidden to avoid blowbackalso with gina it was the same thing  she was antagonizing the audience  like I dont agree with it either and I still cant believe the woman from red alert 3 that played the russian hottie was on our side the whole damn timebut Im not gonna lie and said she didnt do wrong  she openly antagonized her audience regardless if it was justified or notgranted pablo picasso there  pebele picasso  what is that guys name  ah pedro pascal should have been disciplined for the same reason  as he was doing exactly the same thing. should they have been fired  hell no  I would have suspended them for 6 weeks without pay and told both of them to get the h ell off of social media if it was my gigbut thanks to the blatent favoritsm of them  well you cant help but root for gina as it was more like she put it out there for people to trip over while petie pacasso there was opening doing whatever he could to s hit on the right. despite the fact that the dumb s hit doesnt know thatsocalism is literally part of the word when it came to the national socalist party of deutchland that he so often compaired the right towhich gina despite loving to use that word and the time period so much with the c o vid thing never ever brought up with him. like their both dumb f uck s really lol which is kinda why despite what garry thinks of her  where he practically worships her just at the mere mention of that  I dont really give a toss  although I do miss her in that outfit in red alert 3  God that game was fun  you had tim curry  kelly hu  her  takaI and all that doing all that crazy fun acting in that  and all that and to think that was 2008which is why you should never ask an actor what he thinks of anything  as look what it leads to  oh well  I didnt ask  they answered  what can I say  it aint my fault they screwed everything up by talking back at thin air like they did lolalso with the defranko co vid thing at 13 40 it was one of the thing where its best to stay out of it  you have alot of histerical people venting on the internet  its a private choice  its the respect and professionalism thing all over againlike when people are freaking out its best to give distance  Imean I lost a neaubor to the thing just as the thing was starting out  that thing wasnt imaginary  it was real  it wasnt made up bs  the way it was handled was howeverlike the rationalismn just wasnt there  like look at all the people who freaked out about toliet paper and everything else that came from it  you should have just given them space as you dont want to cause a situation like you seem to have a real trouble with discretion   like I get theirs a time to speak up and say what needs to be saidbut to say that in the middle of the pandemodium on a left wing website that is already way off its rocker by default is just  yeah  like your tact is way off here  like I get your on the internet alot and see alot of this garbage  but some of it isnt just because of the woke garbage  its just basic business senselike biting ones lip to make money  it doesnt always feel right  but its the best way to prevent wide facing damage such as that and making a situation worseas when your an ambassador  you speak for the company and the people behind you  their vision of the company  the people your interviewing and speaking with  is you  and that requires tact  discipline and careful wordsas if you fail or screw up  everyone gets that blowback.
fans of the playground dont choose that either.  born that way  is a bad argument because it works for fans of the playground as well. and well  in the modern era people are defending them now too. weird  its almost like logic is a two way street  or it isn t really logic  its propaganda.
I dont agree with you on this. I know too many people that pass from it but the real issue if people had just worn a mask for one month we would have been done with this whole thing. would need the thing in the arm.
they need to add character customization to every game. that way. if you want to be a fat  blue haired sjw you can be  without crapping on what everyone loves about the game. we can have lara how we always loved her and they can get what they want too.
you should post on rumble so if you get to spicy and they take a video down its on rumble to lol
I dont think that I agree with any of your politics at all  yet somehow I support you as an artist nonetheless. go figure.
I got the blank because my grandpa s doctors said he cant get blank  or he ll most likely die  he s on oxygen 24 7 and has other health problems . but Im not the type who would force someone to make a decision about their own body that is permanent like that. I believe everyone should have their own choice. I bet that you could go back into these cancel culturers lives and find something even worse than what you said back when you were 17. I wonder how many of these people are hypocrites...also  I dont really follow a religion  but Im not going to try and burn down Christianity just because I dont really follow it much. I believe there is a higher power and all  but I was not raised Christian  and I have never had the time to go to a church or anything. sorry if my comment is long. I just dont know where else to say this that wont cancel me.
the quartering sent me here for the long haul
the quartering sent me.quality vid. I find it repulsive they tried to cancel you on a non controversial take or ones that were not political at all. liking lara crofts look is what originally  sold her. its also wildly dishonest for anyone to say that jeremy is a white supremacist. hes just another cantankerous youtuber. I cant see him being anything other than being a decent person.
appreciate you sharing
cancel culture is horrifying and hypocritical. everyone is entitled to their own opinion. if you dont like what someone says  ignore it. dont try to ruin someone because you disagree with them
just saw your story on the quartering. didn t know who you were and tbh this is not my genre but I subbed  and I ll try to stop in for a video and a comment from time to time. this cancel culture must be stopped!!!!signed super misogynistic trump supporter  sarcasm
subscribed! lets keep in touch! cheers!
you can never satisfy the woke left. they ll always expect more and more struggle sessions from you because of the never ending oppression olympics they participate in. anyways  much respect to you and standing your ground. you earned a new fan.
just here for the un cancelling
yeah  Im definitely not a fan of the butch  androgynous  only-technically-female game character. I identify more with curvy  sexy chicks who kick ass. bayonetta is my favorite female game character because she is sexy  strong  and completely comfortable with using her sexuality as part of her arsenal. if bayonetta wasn t who she is  she would not be my favorite. its like  women who appreciate sexy female characters exist  honey.
as unpopular as this might sound  judging by how your views have changed a bit. idk what exactly 17 year old melonie said but  by your current summation  she wasn t wrong. we are called to be the salt of the world. to call a sin wrong isn t hateful but the opposite.  if you love someone you try to help them. of course those people can disagree with you but your not coming from a place of hate but rather a place of love. the wages of sin is death. if you love someone then it would makes sense that you would want them to live an eternal life  so they must turn away from sin.
and boom! you are uncanceled!
Im sorry these assholes are trying to cancel you. these people are cruel and not right in the head. they re no different then the psycho mob running around the village looking for  witches  to burn.stay strong melonie!
holy shot that needler in the corner is huge..
damn!  when did melonie become such a naaaaazzI with massive internalized misogyny and open Christianity !   I haven t really been following and didn t know you ever had a gig with gamespot but I wasn t expecting all these unacceptable opinions from someone I feel like has been around youtube   gaming industry since at least 2008 or so.  I just saw the twitch channel the other night and hadn t seen other content since the brief relationship with kevin some years ago.
love you  screw the woke bullies!! glad to find this channel! and agree 100  wish we had the old lara back the one we all became fans of tomb raider  so damn tired of these so called male feminists pushing non appealing  manly female characters down our throats ie.that idiot neil druckmann  the last of us 2  etc... I really wish a new game dev would surface that gives the middle finger to the woke community and gives us a none woke adventure game  this game dev will rise to the top!
6 34cops  9-1-1  what s your emergencymale fem  yes  hello  I d like to report that an internalized misogynist called me out online in a tweet and it hurt my feelings-cops   click  dial tone male  h-hello
jeremy is a racist that believes he s smarter than the average racist because he s able to self edit racist terms from his verbiage  however if you compare most of his positions to that of a front facing racist on the same topics there ain t much light peaking through between them.  if you choose to believe that little pin light of difference between a deceptive manipulative racist and a front facing one makes all the difference in the world for you thats certainly your prerogative.gina carano on the other hand  I believe  is just a contrarian thats found that being contrary for the sake of being contrary has worked well for her and hasn t yet had the wool covering her eyes yanked.  guaranteed  most of the people that claim to support gina now were likely talking all kinds of shit about her before her fallout with disney and once she s outlived her usefulness to them they ll go back to the same.  hopefully  she ll be able to resume building the character of cara dune at that time.sexuality connotations aside lara croft s costume design was old as hell.  whatever isn t changing over time is dying or dead.  the character was always designed to satisfy the male gaze first and foremost and thats why its so difficult to get the character games taken seriously even now.  aside from that once the creative direction of the franchise went more photorealistic to stay in step with the times the character had to be redesigned to fit into the world  which should be pretty easily understood.
the quartering sent me here and Im definitely staying.
11 16 to be fair its kinda dumb to defend gina in that time  she literally compared being anti-vax to being jewish during the holocaust and compared people who were mad and outing anti-vaxxers to nazI collaborators during the holocaust. she deserved what she got  and honestly she s thriving in her own way now. shes doing movies for shapiro and doing her own shit now. shes not locked down by a disney contract.
dont try twisting things. refusing a easy and safe shot that would increase the general health and safety of the entire world is the definition of selfish. I guess you can argue that you have the right to be selfish but its not very Christian to refuse that tiny sacrifice to help your fellow man.
I never got the shot  because my job doesnt allow me to interact with anyone. Im doing fine.
just wanted to say who one is attracted to is a choose whether gay or straight. you can debate it all you want which is fine that would be incorrect. just like a person chooses whom they wanna date whether gay or straight. God gave us freewill. we can choose to do good or evil sin  but there are consequences for choosing evil. being part of the lgbt goes against God. romans 1 26-28    26  for this cause God gave them up unto vile affections  for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature   27  and likewise also the men  leaving the natural use of the woman  burned in their lust one toward another  men with men working that which is unseemly  and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  28  and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge  God gave them over to a reprobate mind  to do those things which are not convenient
I say think of it as this  you ended up finding out how fake your so called  friends  were.
came from the quartering.  hope to see more of ur vids soon.
I would not have thought before but you look a lot like danika patrick in the thumbnail for this video. and in the clip you showed from gamestop tv
jeremy sent me    and dropped a sub and a like. I look forward towards your content.
love the vid! as a woman I prefer the sexy characters. pls upload lots!  3
how did you look older back then than you do now
honestly im surprised gamestop is still around but I wont be using them at all.
interesting. I think its selfish to pressure and coerce people into taking a single flu shot that hasn t been well tested.
@espiogirl  selfish is by definition self interest. promoting something that is proven to help the entire world is the opposite of pure self interest. though I suppose you could selfishly want to end the pandemic too and the overall benefits are just extra.so you can claim promoting world health is alot of things but saying it is selfish is just factually inaccurate. your claim that the vaccines were not well tested is also factually inaccurate. they were tested as well as any other fda approved drug.
just because people are trying to silence you  I ll sub and leave a comment hahaha
joining aftering waching the quartering video. really shit how the woke crowd is treating you. good luck on the channel!
he who must not be named sent me. looks like your choice of friends has been vindicated.

gamestop screwed up though.
let me guess they tried to replace you with something cheaper like nft s.
I remember going to gamestop back in the 90s... now they just sell over priced games and out of date collectables.
one day the cancel crowd would one day be cancelled for bullying..
subbed... n still not  .good for you... its amazing how unpopular free think n the truth is these days.
there was an evil lexI incel that made a video calling her fake and looking trans. of course I told you tube to not show his channel anymore. you rock melonie.

game stop still exists the pandemic killed the one in my backwater town

I know this video is a month old so no one will see this but   how tf are you 35  you look 25
you should get on more alt tech  and leave yt behind! go to gab!
I saw you from the quartering  cool channel.
Im here because of the quartering  gorgeous  intelligent and not woke........what more could you ask for
dude was probably salty that lara croft was getting more woman than he was... and she s a fictional character..
go boom girl.
lgbt here. not offended  and I support your right to free speech and body autonomy. keep being yourself    and holy crap  youre 35   0.0 you look younger than me 0.0
go boom is bestest phrase
I thought your voice sounded familiar when I saw your video on the woke cancel culture mob earlier today.
35  damn  I thought you were 25 by your appearance.  o
@3 47 to quote amemorable moment from a  game and bruce willis  apocalypse   oh! those polygons
was sent over by the quartering  subbed
this pg culture we live in where you cant have a voice is beyond messed up I always get crap for speaking my mind and valid points and called conspiracy theoriest lol you keep speaking your mind
you are very quiet compared to most channels. you need to up your recording level and a pop filter would help.
wow those ppl are crazy!
11 21we live in west korea and your allowed to have any opinion you want so long as it is the correct opinion.
gamestop tv  that was a thing
so thats why your voice sounded so familiar!!
I didn t recognize her without curly hair.
man  this kinda stuff makes me always think about what the fuck is happening with this world lol. the cancel culture is so bad.
subscribed!!
omg I thought you looked familiar! !   I used to be the asm of a gamestop
I like lara croft as she was before as well. there is nothing wrong with it. I also played t.r. so I am included in that 40  . all of this stupid behavior people are displaying is just that  stupid behavior  they somehow feel like they need to have a superior moral standing ground so they can look down on everyone else. a lot of female gamers think just like you  me included. apparently it is fine to shame you as   empowering   of  only some women is the goal here. the rest of us are just garbage they need to get rid of. so I fully agree with you.
can you post your videos on rumble too
hope this channel blows up.
proverbs 29 25 -  the fear of man lays a snare  but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe.

nailing it. who you are friends with should not matter no matter what. itseems like gamestop is so far up the woke a   that they have no idea what they sell and who they sell to. disappointing.
try yt for a bit. its unreal to thing we have gone this far  cancelled by association is literal guilt by association as as ever with these things  nobody elected the judge  jury or executioner.
I just did not expect you to be 35
 .
hI dude. quarter man sent me.  good head on your shoulders not that I needed to tell you that. subbed.

the quartering sent me here
dam your 35! I thought you were maybe 20.
games stop tv  umm no wonder iam  months late even for this vid also.
so  along time ago when you first started out I called you a fake pc gamer 9yrs ago  . youreplied to me  Im sure it touched a nerve  I understand at the time you were learning and I feel bad for being so rude. so my apologies. I hope this drama passes and all this does is make you a bigger influencer.
lara croft all over the place!!!
did you have a gaming youtube channel too I cant find it.
jeremy from the quartering gave you a shout out so here I am
lets be honest. melonie was too hot for gamestoptv
I love playing video games queen games relate to you because Im am gamer and dont care about the views and I appreciate recording my videos and I concealer you guys as friends
subbed!
not sure why but  you kind of remind me of the little girl from wreck it ralph.
this is who should have been the host to g4 not that joke of a host floss whatever its name is.
what a nice profile picture
I went to your rumble account  and itshows no videos loaded.
fun fact  a lot of old people 50-70 year olds troll and rile up other people in twitter and youtube. theres bots that like their comments if they are of the algorithm it looks for. communism  socialism  and woke matters is like food to those sharks  so if you want likes to seem liked and successful you comment positive on those matters.
came from the quartering
did you say you were homeschooled  see  that is the danger of homeschooling - it produces ppl who are not afraid to think ...

happy new year on this rainy day okay so someone s complaining about the fact is that you used to work for gamestop thats what they complaining about tomb raider so last of us 2 get a pass do they work for gamestop the answer is no so they have no history not a pro member whatsoever then the great lake richard pryor said have a coke and smile shut the f     you still miss the classic angelina jolie tomb raider I dont blame you Imiss it too
male feminists is such a weird concept to me. especially with the whole  we dont need no man strong independent woman  etc etc etc..
I get that a lot
I get all about marketing. but you might want to tell thequartering to stop blatantly misleading people about all this.
youre 35  I d say you look 17...
pet the dog please
12 years! !  when did you start  when you were 6
hImelonie !! new schlep  here. just landed here from jeremy s channel. jeremy discussed your culture-war story regarding game slop and honestly it didn t surprise me. jeremy stated thatsome vile opportunist conjured the mob to pounce game slop to have you tossed out. equally reprehensible are the blanket policies observed by these corporations that enables this climate to continue. if corporations would choose to counsel rather than cancel  this bad climate would stop in its tracks.your new schleps welcome your opinion. lol  bring it !!
we are the resistance. you can be proud to be part of it. the woke empire will crumble. all empires do. women like you or gina have more balls than a lot of men. bravo.
people seriously phoned your people because you follow someone on twatter
you seem like a nice girl
wait. your telling me the alphabet soups are born    nooo dont let the mentally challange make it normal! its totally a choice

I didn t recognize you with straight hair
I have no idea what procedure you are talking about

meloniemacgoboom
@melonie mac go boom  what about minds

people just need to get the hell out of neverland and grow up. maybe even go outside  pick up fishing or some sort of hobby to get their heads out of their fourth point of contact
because you got all the money you wanted...
ur 35 ! u do not look it
came here from the quarterings video  subbed because shes antI woke
guli!
dont go to doktors
wow  they made lara croft look like a really bad attempt of a man trying to become a woman
youre a normal reasonable adult  dont you know thats illegal these days
ooh look a normal person  how outrageous!!!!
cat has left. not good
fems and femboys are ruining gaming with their wokery bs hoss!
so big bad exploitive game stop  who has a monopoly chokehold on the buy sell trade market  treats their employees like crap  imagine that. I did storefront in az and ca for a while. worst job I ever had. 8 hours a week what a joke.
hay I heard you like laura croft
just one question. how many men so far have asked to marry you.
20 20 - out of curiosity  are these people we might ve heard of Im only asking because I want to make certain that I dont associate with them.they sound like shitty people.
was that first loser arthur chu  sounds like arthur chu.
God forbid an attractive woman with a good personality and a capacity to think for herself and form her own opinions has a platform to speak her mind. be a good female  read this garbage script or sit down  shut up and enjoy your freedom quietlylet the record show that Im telling you that twatter is an absolute cesspool. a shallow one at that. best to just yeet that app right into the garbage pile it came from. bury it if you can. you dont want thatstench creeping out to remind you.
so you were  almost  cancelled by a male feminist... he sounds very brave and progressive to me
 ..
most of them are so obnoxiously  woke  that you probably wouldn t be following them anyway haha
so you weren t canceled. they laid off all their employees hosts. such a misleading video.
how the fuck is this chick 35   good diet  active lifestyle   I dont know  but this is the info she should be handing out.

I lost respect for defranco years ago. he s so phony.
comment for the algorithm
hey what s youre rumble  the same
my thing is what does politics have to do with gaming  just make a good game
gamestop is a shit company anyways. I haven t bought anything from them in years. they need to go bankrupt already. its a shame the pandemic didn t wipe them out.
everything woke turns to shit. congrats on the new channel!
gamestop is trash anyway. haven t been relevant since mw3 came out.
quartering viewer coming over to support you against the fascist yes they are the ones who are actually fascist  woke people.
for your women cant drive jokes the following is facts from thailand  they have womens parking areas in shopping centre car parks not for any safety reasons they re bigger car parks so they re less likely to damage others cars because of the stereotype of women cant drive  lol
you must be itlaian with all the hand talking
its not about rights..... personal choices    where does that benefit those who make the world      it doesnt at all  there is no incentive to giving you a choice... the illusion of such is far more powerful. once you understand this.... things will be much easier to understand.
agreed jeremys vids are not white supremist vids but have you tried some of his delicious coffee
honestly  not surprising they didn t renew your contract. they are hurting as a company and any extraneous costs they can cut will help them.
so basically because youre not  woke.  how pathetically typical these days.
being antI woke  antImask  not a feminist in 2022 america  its longer I know  is like being a jew in europe during ww2
its kind of funny that people have a ton of nostalgia and love for games and characters from that ps1 and computer era.  how dare they try to relate and have more affection for an old ip that was fun to play and didn t have to check politically correct boxes.  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when melonie said she got kicked out of a feminist group for liking women cant drive jokes.  lol hilarious.  some people cant handle the truth.  melonie was just being honest and telling the truth women have more distractions while driving than men.  its the same thing now in movies and shows when a 100 lb female is throwing a 300 lb guy across the room like walker texas ranger style.  you dont buy it and it comes off as stupid and sends the wrong message to everyone.  where as if that 100 lb female charmed the brute to do whatever she wanted would make a lot more sense.  or women running in high heels or doing karate or combat moves comes off as stupid. looking at you jurassic world.  it only takes a second to show your character learning that hey you cant take cocktail wear out into the jungle and that laura craft wearing boots or tennis shoes is a much better idea and shows your character learning and growing  making smarter choices.
hello new frien
I wish they had those here in the us
in 2022  women cant drive jokes are still as funny as men getting lost for dumb reasons. you have to be able to take it if youre going to give.
it is said that arguing with an idiot is like putting lipstick on a pig. you are wasting your time and upsetting the pig. you appear to have a good head on your shoulders and that is bound to upset some self-righteous fools! good luck with the channel.
the government has the right to tell you what you can and can not do with your body and what facial covering you  must  wear...how is this any different from islam
nothing more fragile than a guy calling a female a misogynist
reeeeeee reeeeeee women cant look like women. what are you thinking
ayeeee

your e 35  Im not trying to simp here  but you neither look nor sound like it.
youreally need to leave that  church  where the woman is being placed over the men... that is not biblical...
1min 40 secs in and you ve just been rambling from the start. not a good start to a 32min video.better start would be 2 20not trying to troll
attractive  Christian  anti-woke  pro original lara croft  need to stop watching you asap. after this video. or maybe the next. definitely the next.
your face kinda looks off... arent you using too much make up
