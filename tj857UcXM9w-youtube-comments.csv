anyone that calls out the woke bs has got my support
thank you so much on the scripture of the day  and not being an apologizer because of it. apologetics is not about saying Im sorry about being a Christian  but rather boldly proclaiming the faith and having an answer for why you believe what you believe. keep on speaking out in faith and truth!
melonie  Ive really been enjoying your takes on pop culture since the quartering blasted your channel out. thanks for being a rational  genuine and decent person.  also  thanks for your family s service. I just retired from active duty and yes  we have truly warped senses of humor!  keep it up  girl.
when I was in my mid 20s I didn t want anything to do with my catholic religion. however my dad had a cancer scare a few years ago and I found my faith again. he is now cancer free and doing great. keep God in your heart at all times.
mmac   here I am sharing my faith in my videos. cry bully   why are you shoving this down my throat !  mmac   Im sorry  did I come to you preaching my faith or did you come to me just to get offended  boom
mel  as an ex-catholic - now agnostic - I really appreciate that youre not ashamed to proclaim your faith and make it a part of what you do. keep it up  as people with strong moral convictions are needed now more than ever. good job  and stay strong. God bless you
thanks for sharing all these comments with us helps to convince us  normals  that we are not flying solo through the current timeline.
melonie  I used to love you on tr forums. I didn t realize you are a streamer youtuber . will definitely be following  Ive been binging your channel. I love that you are outspoken about your faith and views. so glad there are fellow women like you out there. hello from a new subscriber.
seeing and hearing negative things aimed at you will always affect you. I grew up hating myself because of it. best thing I have found to do to counter it was simply look in the mirror and tell myself I love me. its weird at first but over time it helped me.
the comment about the woke being the abusive spouse in an abusive relationship  and the control element was sadly spot on. very astute observation. keep up the great work  and thanks for sharing these comments and your takes on them.
melonie  keep preaching... youre changing lives for the better out here.  like you said  we are all to be his disciples.  keep planting those seeds of hope to the flock and you will be rewarded with a great harvest.  I can 100  vouch that the smallest gesture of kindness can bring someone closer to God... and even save their life.        true story
hey mel  youre a breath of fresh air and so encouraging. big fan of tomb raider growing up. your video  fans unwoke lara croft  was the first one that I saw  thank you algorithm. when you started reading scripture at the end I was so pleasantly surprised. Im a Christian from canada - so I feel your statements in this video on many levels. I want to encourage you too. joshua 1 9  have I not commanded you  be strong and courageous. do not be afraid  do not be discouraged  for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.
mel keep your head up you are a beautiful person inside and out!!! glad you are here keep up the great work!!!
keep up the excellent work  melonie.
30 18 this describes every rejection I have ever had perfectly. of course I felt sad in the moment  significantly less each time   but looking back  I am so thankful  lol!
heya  mel! jeremy sent me here a while ago and glad I sub d!! love your channel and upbeat attitude. thanks for great content  I can watch with my teen daughter. I loved the comments only vid.  also  live stream a classic lara game for us!!! keep up the fight  its important.  boom!
its beyond me how people can hate melonie. she seems like the sort of person we all need as a friend in our lives
excellent vod  mel! do more of these! cyberlingbot 3d s comment was funny. I wouldn t mind you doing a stream on your main youtube just to see how it does compared to your twitch. you could use restream to stream on both youtube and twitch at the same time  dlive and facebook are some more options you could use for that as well but for facebook you have to pay a monthly fee in order to use restream with it  to get more followers overall  or if not restream then if your twitch still does better than youtube for streams then you could upload edited vods of streams on main youtube or post clip compilations instead. you haven t lost any friends because your real friends are still here and will never leave you  what you lost were fake friends and good riddance to them  those idiots can stay gone.
personally  I would love to see more videos like this.  since I found this channel  Ive appreciated the fact that you feature and respond to comments in your videos.  it makes me much more interested to actively engage with rather than just passively watch your content.  also  I dont get on twitch very much  so I would love to see you stream some games on your other channel.  Im sorry you have to deal with haters  but thanks for speaking your mind.  I look forward to your videos everyday.
videos like this are such a great idea  and I think itshould be a weekly series if youre interested in doing that. there are so many youtubers that ignore their comment section  or they just look at select comments   so it just shows that you truly appreciate your viewer base! Im sorry that you feel discouraged that you ve lost friends over your opinions  but I dont think you should. if they truly valued you as a person  they would continue to be your friend  but the fact they just threw friendship away over a different opinion just shows that they never valued you as a person to begin with.
from a fellow catholic  I am glad you came back.
@daniel w  I as well.
so... youre attributing what your father s doctors did to save his life to God ... ok
@timothy marcoux  what s with the bigotry
@james priest  what bigotry
@james priest  I apologize if itsounded harsh  but thats what itseems like
@timothy marcoux  maybe it was both his faith and preys along side the modern medicine. r u an atheist
@timothy marcoux  ur disdain for his faith and belief that it had something to with his fathers getting well. thats a form of bigotry.
@james priest  yes  Im an atheist  and I dont consider that I expressed disdain  just asked a question that has to do with a harsh truth
@james priest  prayers are only a placebo effect  they can help psychologically  but have no effect on outcomes whatsoever
@timothy marcoux  yes I already knew u were an atheist u put off the vibe of someone in the religion and yes it is a religion as is wokeism is one they both meet all the tenets of what makes an religion.
@james priest  Im not pushing my beliefs on anyone  I was just asking a question
@james priest  atheism isn t a religion  its a lack of belief in anything supernatural
@timothy marcoux  no lol u were being condescending and yes u were. as u were typing it out u were looking down on him and thinking how can anyone believe that crap. does the constitution say there is a separation of church and state
@timothy marcoux  no it is one. u believe that there is nothing super natural. u have doctrine u live by. u believe that u or the government is the highest power. u look down and belittle anyone that doesnt believe like u.
@timothy marcoux  and r u the highest authority on the matter  can u prove with out any doubt they dont work  and let s just say for sake of argument that ur right isnt helping psychological in itself proving ur argument wrong
@timothy marcoux  answer the question. does itstate in the constitution there is a separation between church and state  do u think the us is a democracy  do u believe the 3 5th was racist
@james priest  its not a doctrine  its knowledge and I dont think my question was belittling anyone
@james priest  I dont live in the united states so I live with another constitution
@james priest  Im not the highest authority on the matter  because I do research before speaking
@james priest  but the first amendment of your constitution says that congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
@james priest  also  how can youread my mind and know that I was typing the comment while looking down on someone  all I wanted to express was that religion gets you to go back through confirmation bias and a sense of community. the question wasn t meant to be disrespectful  the person is free to believe whatever they want
@timothy marcoux  how do I know cuz ur an atheist and I know to many of them and how they think. doesnt being an atheist and being inside that community get u the same confirmation bias as well  u throw out these words without reflecting on urself and that maybe its u. I see ur not answering my questions..... tells me alot about u.
@timothy marcoux  indeed. meaning there shall be no state religion like that of europe and britain. what is does not say is that religion or religious beliefs must be stripped in fact if u read the founders papers and private correspondence thats what they were going for and in fact the term separation of church and state came from a letter between jefferson and a friend of his that was a southern baptist and was worried that he and his congregation wouldn t be allowed to have an rally in dc. were u taught this in school  no its a lie just as the us being a democracy that to is a lie. we r a constitutional republic and that it is written in the constitution that we must remain as one. the founders didnt like democracies cuz they always fail and cuz as they put it thats its nothing but mob rule. its the tyranny of the majority.
@james priest  the religious freedom that exists in the us allows for places like salt lake city  utah to exist.
@james priest  I can say that prayer doesnt work because the times itsupposedly works can be attributed to coincidence
@james priest  just so there is no room for doubt  prayers are in no way helping the poor children in africa that are dying from hunger  God didn t protect the victims of 9 11  prayers aren t working for the russia ukraine conflict and the eventual end to that conflict cant automatically be attributed to God but to the way things eventually work out. there are many other examples.
@james priest  I would highly recommend the video the Bible s plagiarized  pagan beginnings  by the channel the truth hurts  you can watch it and come back to me if you d like. the video is incredibly well researched and unbiased  and it doesnt belittle anyone.
@timothy marcoux  sir Im aware of the Bibles beginnings. the Bible as well as the church is ran by man so there for is corruptible and imperfect by that doesnt take away the fact that there is a God. u nor anyone can prove there is not just like I nor anyone can prove there is except for the mathematical perfection that is the universe but even that is not enough proof.
@timothy marcoux  no it goes much deeper and further then that. on the life of my 8 month old daughter that if the founders came from the past to today I can guarantee 2 things one they would be in amazement of the technology and 2 would be so ashamed by what the government has done what it has become and the lose of faith in the Lord. I dont see what salt lake city has to do with anything. I was born there its a great place with friendly people that u can walk down thr street at night a not worry about being killed. has some of the best protections for 2a. for the last 2 years the government has dictated our lifes told us where to go what to wear what to put in our body s. it violated the first amendment in both religious manner and the censoring what can said and what to believe. it picked what stores u could shop at it killed hundreds of thousands businesses. made thr opioid crisis with the new laws in 2009 and then made it worse over the last 2 years caused the death of thousands that killed themselves during the last 2 years. killed the economy and since this retarded old racist got in it has only gotten worse. we now live under a dictatorship even tho people like u bitched that the last one was a dictator but there was no evidence of that in fact even group and community was doing better then they had in many many years. ur wrong and thats ok u have the right to be wrong.
@james priest  the reason why I said that your freedom of belief allows places like salt lake city  utah to exist  is because  if religions weren t allowed to exist or something like that  the government would be trying to drive the lds church out of the city. as far as Im concerned  you are free to be a mormon.
@james priest  regarding the lack of evidence pointing to the inexistence of God  it is faced with an equal amount of lack of evidence pointing to his existence.
@james priest  as far as Im concerned  you were allowed to worship  but through video conference platforms such as zoom.
@james priest  I will leave the original point of this discussion to this  my reply was not bigoted  because if a religious person came to a similar comment Imade and said   so youre attributing all God did for you in your life to science ... ok.  I wouldn t have gotten offended  no harm done with that kind of reply.
@timothy marcoux  science is the search for how God made the universe and how it all works. it doesnt matter u comment was to put down his belief in God helping his father and to belittle his beliefs and that falls with in the realm of bigotry. its also very self centered very self righteous and a bit narcissistic that u know better. that goes for all people that think that way.
@james priest  that wasn t my intention  if it helps
@timothy marcoux  actually it does. I do believe intentions matter and if u were just asking questions and not belittling then we re good.
@james priest  honest question what makes your religion  whatever is it  real and the others fake  whats the difference between your  religion  and other modern religions or old religions your God and their Gods  honest question again  what makes you think science is here to study the creations of God and not simple the study of universe in general  arent you being a little presumptuous  just a little  because you just said that with a lot of confidence not stating as a believe or an opinion but as a fact when its not a fact  its just what you believe because in the of the day is what makes you tik  what makes you feel good about yourself and gives you a purpose in a life for whatever reason you have  what if a tell that you only believe in a  God  or  someone  because someone told you about itsince you were little that there is a God and that is called indoctrination   repeat a lie often enough and people will believe it  or maybe you just had a difficult moment in your life where the only place you found a new purpose was in a religion  but if religion never existed   science would be still here  wheter you like or not still studing and showing how the universe works  honest question again  whats the difference between santa claus and  God  arent they the same   one is here to keep children in line  so if they behave! they get presents if not they get in the naughty list  the other one is to keep adults in line  if you are a good person you go heaven if you are a bad person you go to hell  basically the same the only difference is when you grow up you  you understand that was only to keep you in line and to give you a colorful childhood but it was nothing but a fantasy while the other when you grow up you carry that believe for the rest of your life until you die but you dont have the same opportunity to understand that you lived a fantasy because you are already dead so you ve grown for santa but never for your Gods  but in the end they are all the same
@victor soares  thats alot there lol thank God I didnt read but the top. I dont recall saying fake but do I do believe its the truth. I understand ur hatred its misplaced u should hate the actions of the people that did them cuz yeah I share that and still do with those who do it today. its real man and its cool u dont or believe different but in the end I know Im right. u dont have to believe me or in that and it ok.
glad you came back. I volunteer to counsel couples in retrouvaille.  thats helped strengthen my faith that God loves us all
its actually quite normal for young catholics to tackle agnostic theism and orthodoxy. in fact  you should  because these are the three pillars of Christendom  and there are more important reasons that are discovered on that journey. when we talk about east and west in Christianity  we talk about spititual poles  not geographical ones.
@pal paladin  appreciate you suggesting Im young  but I left catholicism over 35 years ago
@daniel t. wyatt  I wasn t actually speculating on your age at all. that would be presumptuous.
@pal paladin  still  I appreciate being called  young   nonetheless
its so encouraging seeing someone who loves Jesus just be casual about Jesus in life with everything.  no reason to act like it isn t allowed.  just love Jesus while you gave and while you talk and while you walk and while you do all your different hobbies.  its really encouraging. I appreciate.  thank you melanie.
speak your mind my friend!! faith is for everyone but if they dont want it that is their thing!! keep sharing your Bible verses. as a fellow Christian warms my heart sharing your verses on this channel. keep going strong melonie!!! I ll continue praying for your aunt norma amen!!!
religious texts are whatever you want them to be.  if you approach looking for things to justify evil  you will find it.  if you approach it as a collection of stories for entertainment  you ll find entertainment.  if you approach as if its something positive  you will find positive things.  keep doing your thing.  I found some of your stuff like years and years ago and liked your takes back then and I guess the algorithm stopped suggesting your videos because of my viewing habits.  happy to have found you again and good to see that you are still going strong!
absolutely love your new channel   everything you are putting out there.  itsucks that all the haters have such a lonely life they feel the need to try   tear you down  Im glad you have the strength to keep you going.  also didn t realize you were 35  flip it around   thats how old I am always a geek   gamer and always will be.  thanks again   God bless.
thank you melonie so glad I found your channel love your content
so great that youre reading comments! fan interaction is the best. I have to say a special thanks to the drinker as thats where I discovered you. just to piggy back on the  dress at church  comment. what s most important as a Christian is charity. we never want to push people away from the faith.
hello melonie thanks  for sharing these lovely hilarious moments at times.I needed good laughter I really enjoyed when you put prayers on the end of your videos. I hope your aunt is feeling better  takecare melonie
Im a day late but I wanted to make sure I had enough time to sit down and listen. regarding twitter  I just cant go on very often as its so toxic. I have to take care of my own mental health first. regarding your verse of the day  how can anyone be offended by sharing a positive message  finally  Ive been loving being single after getting out of a toxic relationship that lasted too many years.
if they turn on you for being you  voicing your opinions and criticisms on things you like and dislike  then they were never your friend. you were just a convenience to them and now youre a problem. itsucks  it hurts  and it makes you doubt yourself. more speech and the light is what everyone needs to see the truth. out in the open beauty  like you  will blossom while those who are ugly cannot hide. stay true to you and God and may your future days be blessed.
dont let the haters get to you. you are doing a fine job. as a fellow gamer nerd  we dont have many people out here who are on  our side  and its really refreshing. you literally give me hope. keep up the good work and keep posting your content. we support you.
hey melonie Im sure I commented too late for you to see this but Ive been watching your channel every day and it has really made a difference in my mindset. keep up the great work and keep booming!
nice to see ya laugh melanie...never be afraid to be yourself and speak your mind.
the first thing I remember watching the first teaser trailer of reboot lara was   wow  if this were the og lara  either her lifebar would be mostly gone or she would be dead . the original games were about deftly avoiding traps  not falling 20 feet and getting impaled in the side. its a great analogy for woke society today vs. what we had back in the 90 s when lara introduced herself to the world. as for a new game  I would love to see a new classic-style tr game that lets us play as 90 s cgI cutscene lara croft.
dont let the haters discourage you  you are inspiring me to be better. I believe God is speaking to me through you  the scriptures you ve mentioned gave me answers to a problem Ive been struggling with  so thank you for being brave enough to speak truth on your platform!
I think some people must just be jealous or dealing with own insecurities. so they take it out on you. obviously not okay but its definitely not your fault. you rock girl
your doing a great job mel love the videos  love the faith keep itstrong in the Lord even when things are hard. I also love the vers of the day thing
I enjoy your takes on many subjects they are informative. I have to say thank you for also spreading Gods word  anytime you can speak the truth its a good thing!
this is great to see as a nerd and a Christian. keep it up!
so not sure if you will see this being the video is 7 months old. how ever I just wanted to comment to say recently subscribed and just rummaging through all your videos. been really enjoying all of it. between you finding out how alot of your close friends betrayed you over your opinions  the woke mob trying to destroy your lively hood  and even in this video you explaining how your single. God has a plan for us all. we are never given more than we can handle. loving what you do and expect me to keep an eye out for your videos. with all the love I can give and God bless you.
I would have to say the most important thing about being a Christian is Christ not charity.
the worst kind of slavery is allowing someone to control how you feel.  - not sure who said that
great video  I love your attitude and humour as its refreshing to see on here as most videos now are depressing for some reason
melonie  I have lost so many  friends   at least I thought were my friends who just abandoned me because of various reason....no money  job not good now political beliefs.... hard times will always reveal true friends.  jonathon swift
not gaming  but gaming related   I d love to see a series of recap videos for each of the games and movies.  not only the lore as canon presented  but also your commentary.  or  to make it just gaming  a series of videos for each game so people like me can see what you love about the character and world so much.
about the hate  be proud! if you try to please everyone   noone really knows you. if you piss people off then the true friends stay. and to be honest.. I think you are the online person that brings me most joy. thank you  -
when people say bad things about you  they are just things usually that are unhappy about in their own life. it has nothing to do with you. better to have one good friend than tons of bad ones
I know this video is older but I wanted to say as a nerdy Christian man myself and so is my wife  I want to commend you for being a nerdy gamer woman and you have faith in Christ and that you post the verse of the day from the Bible in your videos. I do the same thing in my videos and gaming videos thats so awesome thank you for being unapologetic about your faith stay that way and Im glad I found your channel. keepthe faith and stay nerdy forget the left and woke jokes lol bless up melonie
it must be crazy having people love beauty bombing you on one side and the worst of haters on the other.  you are a good person and in the prime of your life.  enjoy your youth and fertile years solo for a while  but lock a guy down while you still have time to grow together.  lots of love to you!
all that melonie-talking-about-tr content lately ! yessss
100 percent agree with the demonic-aliens thing. look forward to that video!!
dont ever feel discouraged. your awesome. your so loved by so many and will always be. never tell yourself otherwise.
I was subbed to you way back in the day maybe when you were moving to la if I remember right. then jeremy gave you a shout out and was like hmmm.. guess I have to see what s going on with her these days. wow. I dont know why I was surprised that you grew up even though I did too. cool. I think youre more relatable at least to myself  now that you feel you can be yourself. I didnt even know you were hosting for gamestop. your dreams have clearly started to come to fruition for that girl from way back. stoked to have a new favorite youtuber to listen to while I work on things.
if somebody would have told me you were 35 I would never believe it you still look like you in your early twenties whatever your doing keep doing it.
melonie  I know how you feel. my bf of ten years broke up with me and my daughter wont speak to me right now. so many fair weather friends  too. but  to thine own self be true.  there is a greater life than this one  a bigger purpose  so stand firm in your convictions. you got this girl!
when your favorite youtuber streamer mentions in a video about when she had your back on twitter!!! . they cant say you dont care about your community! thanks again!
idk how they justify turning lara into a weak character with this  they are doing the opposite of turning her into a mary sue  they re tearing her down and making her into the anti-lara.
I really liked this review of comments. it helps get a frame in place for what youre going through with this and it adds a lot of context. I wonder if you have read the scrape letters by cs lewis  I assume you have   if not  its a quick one and so helpful for those who struggle with the world s reaction to faith . just know that these snapping trolls are playing screwtape s part. they are small-minded  abased  and meretricious accusers. as for being too young to comment on games gaming  no one who has heard you laugh will think you are anything but a full-grown woman.
miss mac answering comments  time to get a work break and listen melonie wisdom
I been following you since you did a video with katie wilson on tomb raider years ago. glad to watch your video daily. love your art. Im a artist myself and trying to improve it more.
thanks for reading my comments melonie  very nice of you. if you do play some games and stream I ll for sure come by and hang out.
maybe its you
hey! glad Ive found someone who is a God-fearing believer  dislikes wokeys and looking dayum fine all at the same time! youre like a kinder surprise egg but better  do they even have that in the u.s   anyway  please keep doing what you do  I think its freaking awesome that youre speaking your mind and having common sense and decency - something that is so lacking in our present age.also - dont be discouraged  being the real you sometimes means shedding off  friends  so that you can find true friends  people who will build you up rather than pull you down. on that note  I ll be more than happy to send some positive vibes your way on those cranky days. are you fairly regular  I ll put it in my calendar!Im honored to be called a boomer - now I cantell people Im a boomer who s not a boomer. that ought to confuse the heck out of them!
watched simpcast. you are legitimately cool.  cant say I have ever said that before about a woman.  look forward to the daily quotes.  nina is awesome. isn t the new vs gals great    honey I thought of you  when I seen these models  could you wear this .
turns out on a tweet  rhianna pratchett  lead writer on both tomb raider and rise of the tomb raider  stated she wasn t a fan of the focus rise of the tomb raider places on lara croft s father. she explained that the decision to make lara s dad the driving force for the character s adventure was beyond her control. despite not agreeing that that was the right direction for lara  pratchett says she  had to make peace with it  in order to do her job.
to me. lara croft was awesome because of how much damage she could take.  not in a domination way lol.  yes she was attractive  but her looks weren t a hindrance. it made people underestimate her and she was willing to break bones  both hers and others  to overcome. it was a  whole package  kind of thing.
apologize for commenting so many times but I really like this form of video. I thought you did quite well with it thank you
I have to say  aesthetically you have a blessed gene pool.
not a Christian but I appreciate the scripture. loving this channel and now youre off the chain being yourself. a friend that ll let you lose them  particularly over opinions  is not a friend. I doubt you ll have to reach far for better ones.
Im just glad I got in  and a featured comment in an earlier video  before melonie mac explodes. props to my fellow texan and Christian. 100k gonna be here before you know it.
exactly how I feel about the wokesters. tried giving them the benefit of the doubt at first  this was way back in 2012 when I started noticing this shit  but they are simply insane.
I had the biggest crush on a girl in high school and it all fell apart before itstarted. but man she wound up getting knocked up a couple months later and has like 5-6 kids now. shit  I dodged a bullet there. I would ve so been in an insane asylum. thank you Lord!!
your personality shines through    its as pretty as the rest of you  its what makes you so fun to watch.  congratulations with your new channel
if it comforts you at all  Ive lost a lot of friends because I hold two to truth of Christ and not to whatever it is they want me to believe. stay strong.
naw losing those  friends  sucks true but that means they weren t ever really there for you  you can go make friends who are better for you
keep up the good work mel!
the sad thing that many gamers cant acknowledge is that they are simply too weak to speak with their wallets. not giving in to false hope and hype trailers is just something they cannot muster the will to do.the industry knows this well and its the reason they tend to show such little consideration to us as consumers. because they know the majority have no control and will cave when release day comes.
if youre thinking of live streaming it would be awesome to play through all the different tomb raiders... like a few hours of each release every other week or something... thanks for the awesome content
at around 7 50 in I noticed it looked like you had dyed your hair purple. I thought  oh no! she joined the blue hair brigade. there goes my crush . then I remembered you said something about the lighting in the room being purple. its merely a reflection. thank goodness!
what if you call these kinda videos the comment barrage to keep the theme of  boom . loving your vids btw.
thank you for videos  melonie! a reprieve from hellish landscape which is called russia.
I ll say it melonie you freaking rule
if you get any hate  use it as fuel to drive you forward  sometimes you need to embrace your rage.
my question is with the diet that youre on especially with your regimine  do you have a recipe list that we can use to make our own food that you usually eat
are you doing a q and a once a month  I like it
okay so I just realized that melanie mac was the same real  gamer chic  that I saw in a video years ago about doing real military drills with the military. Imade a pretty thorough critique  as a combat trained vet  of it  I did point out that neither women were wearing plates in their vest   a few instructors failed to correct certain thing  but I also pointed out that it was impressive as hell that the dark haired girl  melanie  was really giving it her all and was legitimately listening   improving. of course Imostly got replies of   she s hot shut up.  but I was impressed back then  Im blown away now. as an aside  Im typically not a fan of Christianity  but I can legitimately say that itseems to have done melanie good. if it helps her be   feel useful   stay strong in her balanced morals then hell ya.
I just became a sub love your channel you speak so much sense for a young woman  so hello from northern ireland.
I have enjoyed your videos on lara croft. the first intro to tomb raider was on the n-gage  taco phone  at e3 2003. I know  terrible intro. the only game I have played in the series was the first from the reboot. I really enjoyed it but can see why some hate it b c of the physical changes. keep up the great work
melonie  I recommend not talking about how you should or shouldn t be sorry about your opinions  and just share your opinions.just comes across as emotional damage that you cannot repair.  3
youre the youngest looking 35 year old Ive ever seen  I would ve never expected that
hanging out enjoying another episode. good times!
one the note of relationships that you mentioned  I wanted to share a few points.firstly  far too many think of being single as a curse rather than a blessing. you cannot be truly happy in any romantic relationship until you can learn to be content while single. otherwise you will rely far too heavily on your partner for your happiness  putting a burden on them that no person can fulfill. if you are a believer  the source of your happiness should be God s love  not your partners. Jesus himself said that if you love your partner  or even your parents kids  more than you love God  youre not going to heaven  plain and simple. I dont say that to scare anybody  but we really cant be sugarcoating the fact thatspiritual priorities are important. marriage romantic relationships in general should be viewed as a blessing  but never as a necessity.secondly  and along similar lines  we have a tendency to focus too much on  finding  the right person  than on  being  the right person. we ought to focus more on becoming the man or woman we want to be than we do on finding the man or woman we think we ought to be with.thirdly  and lastly  remember to be patient. when I was younger  I was sure I d be married by 25. that didn t happen. still hasn t  and Im in my 30s. but Im still going to wait. it is better to wait than to settle. if you know what your standards are  what youre looking for  etc.  provided they aren t unreasonable in and of themselves like  I only date women over 6ft tall  or something lol  you should never lower them. read ephesians chapter 5. read proverbs 31. understand what a Godly partner looks like  and what a Godly marriage looks like  and be willing to wait for God s timing. and remember also that it is not God s plan that all Christians be married. the apostle paul was single for his entire life and was still content. it is ok to desire marriage  scripture says  he who finds a wife finds a good thing  and obtains favor from the Lord. -proverbs 18 22  but thatshould not be our number one goal. our primary goal should be service to God. referring back to point 1  priorities matter.thats all I wanted to say I think. all the best everyone. God bless.
well my sister was born very petite with very tiny waist and kinda big boobs for her natural build. so she didn t like they way she looked and went to gym to build muscles. she s now very good looking  because she s very fit  has strong abs but still has that tiny waist and big boobs. two other sisters were textbook female body type  bigger boobs and butt  wide hips  and they too are still very fit because they did lot of sports and martial arts since they were kids to their mid 20s. oldest sis is actually still active  she s in gym like almost every day.
I wonder if thats where the origin of calling someone hot  came from  when someone builds more muscle  their body temperature tends to be on the warmer side. a coworker of mine who has twice the muscle mass as me but the same overall body size  is only ever wearing a tshirt at work  while me being just skin and bones and fat  need to wear 3-4 layers indoors just to feel like its room temperature. I gotta get back on the grind for those gains...Ive been slacking too much over the years.
I have given this year to work on my self to 1 get into shape. 2 adjust to a major life change that I went through in 2021 due to two things the loss of my mother who was one of my best friends and I was also her care taker as she was really sick with end stage liver failure and the other was becoming a home owner. 3 Imyself have been single for so long I want to take the steps to overcome my shyness from my social anxiety which may be a result from my autism and I will be turning 30. because I want to start dating. idk if that is selfish but I want to do this for me so that I can finally overcome my limits with being able to be social with others I canto an extent but I want to be able to go beyond that.
21.8k subscribers!!!!!!! keep the digital gold flowing sister!!!!
the truth is supposed to hurt  thats how you know you ain t got it.
hello melonie mac! first of all I would like to introduce myself as I am new to this community.  my name is florian and I really like video games.how did I end up here   I got a suggestion from youtube a few days ago  I dont even remember what the video was. I think it was multI stream with some commentary on a given topic. you were in that video and I was like  hey  I know her from somewhere .  so I looked you up and remembered that I had seen you in some lara croft cosplay years ago.  I thought at the time that you did a really good job with it.  now I know  again  who you are. why did I forget that   its like a sunken treasure has been unearthed.   I was very surprised when you mentioned Jesus Christ in one of your recent videos.  so I watched a few more videos of you and saw that you are reading psalms or daily verses from scripture.  that makes me very happy  and please continue with it. this is another channel I wasn t looking for but now I know I want it in my life.  I find here an awesome content creator  video games  illuminating difficult topics  social commentary and on top of it talk about Jesus Christ and scripture.  all wrapped in one package.  you got a new subscriber.  thank you for your work.  I appreciate you! this is an additional channel for me and you got the vibe! here is something I want to share with you therefore we do not lose heart. though outwardly we are wasting away  yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.  2. corinthians 4 16 have a nice day or night! see you soon in another comment section!
some say they found you through the quartering. I saw you randomly with the lara croft video. clicked on it and binged what was available.
youre pleasure to listen while playing! keep it up - for our pleasure!!
I think being in a relationship would be nice and all  but I too find myself wondering if Im being too picky or if God has bigger plans before I can get to that point. however  I try to remind myself of abraham  ot iirc  being 100 by the time him and his wife sarah having their son issac. hopefully Im not that old mind you.  as for what youre doing  I find it to be a relief thatsomeone like yourself  and a few others  is out there sharing not only your faith to help others who feel alone and shunned by society. itseems like we re in a time where good and evil have flipped by secular standards  where good is considered bad and bad is considered good and try to demonize and shun those for having faith in God and all that is actually good. its like they re trying to preemptively attack anyone who questions them and their  wokeness  and take it as a verbal attack and call it  violence . the insanity and lack of logic constantly leave me scratching my head so often  Imay end up scratching myself bald  metaphorically speaking .finally  one of my favorite quotes and something I beat myself up for when I realize I do just the opposite.  going to paraphrase as Im doing this off the top of my head atm  james 1 19 and james 1 20  know this my brothers  be quick to listen  be slow to speak  and be slow to anger. for the anger of man doesnt glorify God. this is especially true when trying to bring a point to someone who is seemingly stubborn when youre trying to do nothing more than help. the point of this though is that when either party is flustered  it is our own ego that gets in the way of truly communicating with one another and sadly often leaves one person with resentment towards the other to the point where no one is helped in the end.
I never thought I d get a  non superchat  comment read on a video. person of ginger is pleased.
and here I thought the legend trilogy was classic lara. I didn t realize that there was a reboot before the reboot.. kinda reminds me of how assassin s creed has changed. now I see my reflection in the face of the ac reboot fandom.btw  are you ever going to do a let s play series of tomb raider  seems like it would be fun as I trek through the legend trilogy..
appreciate that you are outspoken about your faith while not being zealous or judgmental  part of the reason Im now an ex-muslim  agnostic is because I tend to get really irritated by zealotry of any kind and I wanted to be open and accepting of all people and judge them based on their actions not based on some label identity ..etcwhich obviously puts me at odds with sjws a lot since their zealotry is even worse than any religious group I know.also creation and evolution aren t as conflicting as some people make them seem  imo they might be sides of the same coin after all.
tomb raider devs   every time lara has a win we break her down. basically  we just like to emotionally abuse people who love independent strong curvy women. what do you mean  that makes us evil   I dont get it.
stay strong. even though I dont believe in religions I do believe in God. I believe that the different religions have part of the truth and is in the spirit of God. when I was younger I went to church with a friend and the pastor preached a scripture then talked about it. the next week I went to a different church with a different friend and the pastor preached the same scripture and the way he talked about it was completely different from the first pastor. even though that makes me question religions I still believe that God puts things in front of us to make us stronger.
I just found yourecently when u   drinker did a video. Christian s need a set! thx for being Christ like   he went hard after the pharisees.
melonie Ive been given thought about finally attending church. how do you find a church that works for you
tank tops look good on you!I like your content and your natural way of speaking  you are gifted!
I appreciate and respect the verse of the day   also sorry if some of my past comments on previous videos are somewhat curse wordy but Im unapologetically me though my language can sometimes be a little course.  Im a gen-x and I dont mind being called boomer though gen-x rules.
just remember haters are going to hate whether you do anything wrong or not because they are full of malice  piss and vinegar. its not easy but if you cantry and remember to use it as an opportunity to pray for your enemies which is what we are told to do by our Lord and savior Jesus
hI  really enjoying the channel content.   criticisms   an architectural professor once told us that we will get criticism but we need to look at the source then evaluate it for what it is worth.  @holes  criticism is worth 0!about friends.  look up bishop td jake s yt video about 3 types of friends. he is so right and it really helps.  I have shared it with many people.
not to make this all about me.... but I am very happy to be here when melonie only had 3.2k subs. the explosion that happened after could be due to me subscribing. or maybe it was jeremy from the quartering told 1 million of his closest friends to check melonie out. Im sure the historians will sort it out.
4 40 from a platonic scientific perspective andorian women are always more warm bloodied so staying warm is easy when your body temperature is hotter than warm bloodied humans.    I always wanted to use thatstar trek line.
I also consider this your main channel. btw  I think its funny being called a boomer
I love 2006 version  more human but still pretty and badass
even though im getting older idk how I feel about being called a boomer
melanie is  spot on with lara croft
my God continue giving you many blessings melanie!
Ive lost a lot of friends too because of all of this.
I can believe the tomb raider devs still dont know how to use the body shape slider for lara s in game character model. lol  hopefully modders can figure it out in the future!
here s a tip that might help you when you get all stressed out in annoyed and angry is what I do is get a nice hot milk  darken the room and put on music of my choice usually techno recline my chair and just chill it is so relaxing I just empty my mind I end up feeling much better. or just say f.u.b.a.r.  or s.n.a.f.u. I think you know what they mean.
you have brains and beauty. God blessed you.  never be ashamed of that!
conflict is in the air we breathe.it is the water in which we swim.the ride never ends. when you stand for the good  the beautiful  and the true  you sign up for a neverending series of battles in a war against evil  falseness  and ugliness. there are times when I grow restless if Im not being attacked in some form. because this is the way things work  it does not do to let conflict be a draining strain  much better for it to energize.
a comment on the comments video  shocking. I had to make a comment though. Im 14 minutes in and you mentioned the  I know prayer doesnt mean much...  people. they  sadly  just haven t seen the power of prayer  and based on the quote they dont have faith  matt 17 20 . granted I went to Bible college and I saw many miraculous events in my time there. edit  whenever you feel down due to people attacking you  it is just satan attacking you making you want to quit. remember  though  there are more on our side then his  2 kings ch 6  vs 16 .
you have to have faith when you pray. if you dont have faith in it  you think it doesnt mean much then you are just wasting you time. epic. thank you for that. with that  my family and I will keep praying for you and your soapbox.
looking forward to your thoughts on aliens fallen angels. Ive been reading viewing about that over the last few years. very enlightening  as a long time fan of science fiction  its more than interesting  more like edifying  to learn about what is the likely actual reality of things. God bless you and keep up the great work! love your laughs and cheerful overall approach  even when things are more than a bit crazy!
I kinda like the new laura  but I get your points 100  ... even tho the old lara games felt very weak on narrative if I am honest.
holy moly you have a big other channel! how have you been around for 13yrs and I didn t find you till quartering mentioned you!  so glad I found you!
zip was in the classic tineline as well so she kind of had a team. tomb raider legend was my first tomb raider game on the psp. it was cool.I personally see a connection between classic and lau lara. both are much better than the reboot timeline. I hope keeley hawes will voice lara again.
Ive never had a twitter and dont intend to get one! itseems to be the cesspool of social media.
5 36 its strange to me that finding people open about religion or spiritual beliefs is uncommon nowadays  whereas merely 100 years ago it was one of our sole defining traits as individuals. why have people grown such disdain or casual negligence when it comes to faith  its refreshing when people discuss it now  but I think its troubling that it isn t done more.
oh  have you played velvet assassin or venetica  they are not even a little alike but I love them both and velvet assassin in particular was not afraid of making a for lack of a better word sexy character
stay the course  as you speak the truth you ll make yourself more and more a target for harassment. what thatshows is that you hurt certain people  wokies  where it hurts. you illuminate the dark places for all to see.
hey  mel. I dont normally go hunting for political themed yt vids anymore  but its been known to happen occasionally. I found your video addressing conan getting axed by amazon because of toxic woke assaninity...and then saw your video on why you arent with gamestop. and that brought me here. now I feel like some slimy cyber stalker  but I will say it anyway  good for you  maam. you made some.very.good.points and I can see just from the three videos that you are not a groupthink robot. I as a fellow Christian  occasional gamer  and fan of og lara s physique  is that like  original gal   appreciate how you see things. but I personally suspect the game devs hate lara considering all the terrible ways they enable the gamer to kill her off by failure to button mash correctly. but maybe thats just me sucking. I hated playing the original game  mechanically  and anniversary  and legend just because of the controls. but they all kept my interest. I prefer far cry 2 as  my combat game ...and kingdoms of amalur re-reckoning as my fun button mashing adventure game. saddly both lack the tarzan-ish traits which lara manifests to varying degrees in various games. yeah  the reboot lara is more realistic. no more double-d cups. disappointing. but honestly how many beautiful gymnastic genius  witty  voluptuous  daredevil vixens can you name that go spelunking  swinging from ancient ruins and trees  and scaling cliffs  fully armed and half naked  engaging in gun fights with wild beasts and evil private militias   let alone to accomplish anything other than self-gratification  I will grant you some women check a few of these boxes  none check all of them.but games arent reality...even when they are supposedly realistic. they re fantasy. and oir fantasies seek to rewuire more inflstion as we become bored with the mundane. superman was fantastic in the 1930s with red and blue tiguts  and a cape  and his big v shaped torso and 6-2 in height. because real men dressed like business men  and were 5-9. boring  mundane  average  didnt own much. he was super. but now our heros need more texture and gadgets...and psychological complexities to be colorful and alluring to us. because we have all attained superdom in some aspect. think of a mmorpg server. some games allow you to jack into the virtual environment and accumulate stuff and build things. when you log out itstays in the game. what happens when everyone on it has accumulated too much crap to manage  some5imes the game is corruoted and glitches occur. time to start it all over again. server reset. like civilization. its a cycle. suddenly just trying to survive in the world is all you can do  and no one is arguing how conan should be de-masculinized...or if they feel like sitting down or standing up to pee.but if enough wallet votes are cast  by not buyimg from producers that love our money  but hate us  maybe the producers will listen  and make something more palatable. maybe. but I have the feeling its a losing battle to find decent  non-corrupted  non-ridicule worthy entertainment these days. just consume the crap they slop onto your tray  or leave it. and wait for the server to reset. then having nothing will be normal again.
I love being a boomer
hey all  may I ask a question to churchgoers in the us  anywhere else but france in fact    Im french and since I was young living in the south west of the country my grandparents took me and my twin to visit every church in all the villages we knew around us. not particularly religious but for the monument in itself  some roman and mostly classical gothic architecture. since these are all tiny villages  between  100 to 700 inhabitants  ans everybody knows everyone the churches until a few years ago were not locked  we could enter them day or night and the bishop or the priest didn t have to be present  the church could be completely empty besides us. we used to love going up the belltower and outside on the balcony around the needle atop the church. we could see the entire countryside for miles on end  and we learned rapidly to not climb it up when the bells rang. scared the living sh t out of us the first time we were caught off-guard next to the bells. my question is   can you or could you do this in the us or elsewhere   the churches we loved to visit and climb were not decommissioned or out of use  its just the way it had always been in the region and until a few years back we could still do it  a new law forced mayors to lock the access to the belltowers since there may have been incidents of people falling or degrading the church   never knew the answer. anyway can you or could you visit and  carefully and while respecting the monument and its sacred qualitiy  climb up to the top and outside or is it a peculiarity from france  cheers to all !
what bugs me about the mainstream media is that I know people in the news industry have a dark sense of humor but on tv they try and act super polite. you cant take life serious when youre constantly reporting about children dying in school shootings 24 7. our society is screwed up  you might as well laugh about it.
I didn t actually know what your other channel was  thought whenever you d refer to stuff on your other channel you were talking about past stuff you did for gamestop so channel you didn t control or were no longer posting on. if you intend on still using it you should link it in the featured channels etc   edit  not saying this to tell you what to do or anything just mentioning that your subs here aren t 100  overlap with your subs on your other channel
tip of the spear.  Im older but you all inspiring us to pile in. tip of the spear.
dude I love the prince of egypt. the soundtrack is great
so this is 2 weeks after upload at the time of writing this comment but ngl its actually thanks to your channel I decided to get back into tomb raider after 15 years or so and saw steam had the entire legend trilogy on sale for less than 30 bucks and the old games under 20. so I bought them and I have to ask  do you judge people for wanting to start with the legend trilogy and work backwards through the games and does legend lara still pass your personal muster of what constitutes as  iconic  lara croft. cause its no secret the woke raider does not.
zip was only in a tiny segment of one classic game  and the one that departed from a lot of the classic elements at that. so apart from one tiny instance  no she had no team
what do you mean 100 years ago  in the uk back in 1980s 70 percent of people went to church regularly in sundays its now just 7 percent . its the same for many western nations . the reason is if course the internet
@spartan300  I respectfully disagree. I specifically mention the century because of industrialization and globalization - 2 gradual but highly impactful alterations to the way we conduct our lives as human beings. the industrial age ushered in a new dependence on science  study  and technology that influenced how people view themselves as well as any higher power. by the time the second world war was ending and the nukes were dropped  I believe a lot of people became distant from their past perceptions of God and spirituality in general. people will always define themselves through some sort of faith. my point is  however  that their faith has shifted from traditional theism to a reliance on the power of technology and the influence of man.
@spartan300  also  just to specify  I dont think going to church necessarily reflects how people perceive themselves or represent themselves to society as a whole. tradition breeds habit and habit breeds comfort  so a lot of the holdovers in different faiths continue to worship simply because its what they know. these kinds of cultural changes occur slowly over generations as people fall gently away from active belief. I  for example  was raised an active church-goer  but eventually convinced my parents to stop attending through sheer refusal. I still believe in God  but my faith is my own and I think churches are manipulative and ultimately destructive.
pardonthe typos. I  like an idiot  typed that out on my phone and dont use auto correct.
this is the only place where its cool to be a boomer !
hImel! dont know if you ve been in a debate against an atheist Im still learning a my faith so I cant answer a lot of what they ask.
dont know what your stance is on prophtic word in the modern day  but you ve been candid enough to share some of the difficult or frustrating or otherwise negative things you ve been dealing with lately  so I thought I would share a word with you that I received from two completely unrelated sources today the Lord put a word on my heart for my wife  brenda. the Lord spoke and told me that word was for me as well. both brenda and I felt like this was a word for many. so  if you feel this word is for you  receive it by faith and be blessed.the Lord is uncovering areas of your life that have been deeply wounded. the Lord left them buried for a season  but now is the time to unearth the wounds of your soul so that healing may come. do not step off of the potters wheel. stay on it and trust as I craft and fine tune your spirit man into exactly who I created you to be. you must not lean on your own understanding but completely trust me with all of your heart. I will direct your path every step of the way. trust me says the Lord. I will not fail you
we ll be your friends. you are not alone.
for the aliens video  if you haven t heard of him  go down the chuck missler rabbit hole.  youre welcome in advance.
10 00 Im lutheran  lcms   our denomination is pretty much as close to catholic as it gets and Ive never been to a church that would turn someone away for how they dress. insert passage about Jesus saying earthly possessions dont matter to the Lord  come as you are  etc.
my wife and I had a discussion yesterday on the events of joseph and egypt leading up to moses.
as someone that isn t religious. I only ask not just to pray for someone. but to actually do something for people other than relying on your God. dont be that person thatsays you ll pray for them. but literally does nothing else for them. because I can promise you. more people will hate you for it.
the pog guy got me aswell. lmao
the virtuous say what they think. virtue signallers say what they are told to think. a poodle thatsleeps in a silk lined bed  is still just a poodle. yours is lined with self respect
what to do with your main channel   the first thing I do when I encounter a new channel is go to the video tab and sort by oldest.  that tells me years of experience.  then I sort by most popular.  that tells me what the audience look for in the channel.  for your new channel it would be good to put a link to your main channel in the channels tab.
haters  lara croft  and Jesus.  thatsounds like a title for two and a half men episode.
I love Jesus!!!!
stay a strong lady
6 45 if you have some extra dollarydoos laying around  maybe consider checking out the documentary  alien intrusion  unmasking a deception  and or its companion book  alien deception  ufos and the evolution connection   both from creation ministries international. it may provide some additional insight and information. or maybe its redundant  Im not sure what resources you have.Im looking forward to that video though  itshould be interesting.
cole train!!! oh and I just realized  hindsight 2020 now has a new meaning...
you will always have a friend here! unless  you do something really   really  bad. dont do something   really  really  bad...
trey smith has some videos about how he suspects that aliens are actually fallen angels.  check out his youtube channel!  the subject matter he presents is quite fascinating.
loved this video
I am very happy to have found a gaming channel  that follows Jesus but I have to ask what do you think about the Bible scriptures having to do with women . my faith is a huge part of my life to . I totally agree with the reboot lara comment she doesnt even look like a woman anymore .
and I am also a fan of tank tops too. you rokk them!
hI  melonie.I think youre doing amazing  regarding that last thing you said regarding God the big plan for us  I really hope thats not true  because that would mean that he only uses me as an npc for others to success in their life  having a rol and mine being a rug for others. but well  not everyone can win right  in order for people to win others have to lose. sorry  Im a little down while writting this. I really hope for the best in your life. regards
Im half a pog  and I deserve special attention! I need representation!!
they follow the alinsky model which says to accuse your opponent of what you yourself are guilty of.
real question is when can I see melonie mac in a laura croft outfit
depends on what you are obedient to. it is virtuous to submit to proper authority. problem is  modern society has no clue what that is.
imagine thinking being called a boomer is an insult when most of them are living the good life while zoomers and millennials are eating tide pods on youtube.
on the last video  more people cosplay as the classic lara croft rather than the reimagined one. just saying
I commented on your last video like an hour ago  but want to make sure you see it!thank you for being strong and voicing your opinions  many people agree with you. every time someone like yourself uses their platform to talk about these issues  they inspire others to voice their true thoughts. I cant begin to believe how difficult the backlash must be   but please stay strong  youre an inspiration for myself and many others. I love your videos  please keep up the good work  I believe youre making a difference  3
oh  hell yeah. right on  lady.
we will see if there is iron in your words. one day soon Im sure a trailer for a new tr game will release and on that day it will be interesting to see how much youre willing to compromise your values as a fan when cd dangle the scraps of lara in front of us. will you vow to not support it or play it
its nice to see all the comments  you channel and youreading the comments real reassure that I would like to think that a lot of  average joes and jones  including myself  that watch your channel that there are a lot more reasonable and level headed people that can agree and disagree and still be respectful versus what twitter and the loud obnoxious minority wokies would like us to believe
they re jealous of your success
for some much needed encouragement I suggest listening to the channel  david benjamin-Christiansneedthegospel . his channel is dedicated to reminding Christian s about their identity in Christ and it will greatly benefit any believer to listen to him.
evil thrives where good men do nothing.
tbh I actually like both the old and the new lara croft. imo they are both good in their own ways. different doesnt always mean its bad. so Im gonna have to disagree with those who are saying she sucks. she seems to be a more realistic version of lara. she gets injured a lot  needs help from time to time  sometimes she doubts herself  she wears clothing that is more reasonable for the environment she is in etc. as far as not being threatening goes I really doubt most people would have the balls or the skills to do half of the shitshe does so Im gonna have to disagree there as well. as I said though I also like the old fashion lara croft. I grew up on the old games and the original movies so in a way I guess I can also kind of understand why some people may have a problem with  her. as they say though  to each their own . I just wanted to put in my two cents is all. p.s. even though we may disagree on this I still love your videos melonie so keep up the great work.
new amsterdam is a good example of  woke  ruining good things. thatshow was stellar for two whole seasons  on all accounts  and then just fell of a cliff because the writing room went full-on propaganda. characters were ruined  new characters were poorly written  the plot lost everything that made the first two seasons great... it was honestly infuriating. especially what they did to max goodwin  a phenomenal character that became a mouthpiece for the writers that got hit with the  stupid stick  between seasons 2   3.
you should do videos in the woods like thoreau
like  could you imagine kicking out someone because he is poorly dressed 9 go ye therefore into the highways  and as many as ye shall find  bid to the marriage.10 so those servants went out into the highways  and gathered together all as many as they found  both bad and good  and the wedding was furnished with guests.11 and when the king came in to see the guests  he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment 12 and he saith unto him  friend  how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment  and he was speechless.13 then said the king to the servants  bind him hand and foot  and take him away  and cast him into outer darkness  there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
you d make a great next-door neighbor.
when you follow Jesus  there will be people that will leave your life. that happens because they will only hurt your walk with Christ. sometimes they come back  sometimes they dont  it hurts  temporarily. as long as you seek Christ for your joy  instead of others  that temporary hurt  will help you grow as a follower.
instagram

depends on what they show us and if they ve made changes - time will tell
on the woke movement  they started with good goals  however they are a movement that has already reached its goals so they have to invent new ones and new slights to justify their existance.
am I officially now a go boomer  hope so..lol
we as Christians are to strive for perfection  even though we will never achieve it here on earth. our standard is Jesus.
did you ever think of making a video of your testimony
the idea that the universe revolves around one planet is going to be hard to back up scientifically  so Im looking forward to this.  God made us in his image  but that doesnt mean he cant have made another planet full of people out in some other galaxy in his image as well.  in fact  their Bible could be identical to ours  since its divinely inspired.  if we re going with the argument that God said in genesis that he was finished creating  thats only viewing it from our narrow point of view.  we cant grasp all of what God can do as we live within four dimensions and he lives outside of all of them.  he could have created countless planets and placed an adam on each.  this could also mean thatsomewhere out there  eve didn t ruin everything by taking an apple handed to her by a snake.
wel angels can be angels directly from God spirits menifested in puur energie but they can also be extraterestrials because in the end we all come from God and take on roles that help us experience what we want angels from God can infact choose to take on the human experience and be human sortof a angel in human form those are the verry good people among us then after this life or maybe even during this life on  multI dimensional lv they can also stil be an angel this goes into quantum physicic meaning existing in multiple places at ones even in diffirent forms.and yes mischivious forms are sometimes bad or naughty people but can also be demons infact there isnt always much diffirence between demons and psychopaths and yes demons are often mischivious spirits.
I heard your priest is female. my dad s coworker is a female priest who acted as orator during my mom s funeral back in 2019.
faith without works is dead faith  believing is part of the  works  required to accomplish more actions out of faith. its just like working out  or eatting right. if you dont believe in what those things can do for you  why are you doing it  if you dont believe in praying to God and his son  Lord Jesus Christ  then why should you be blessed by them
you are beautiful but more importantly you are totally awesome
for what its worth  I dont think you have to write off evolution just because youre Christian. few non-religious  like me  ever really think much of intelligent design because it was demonized in the 90s when Christians wanted to teach it equally as evolution  and it would get mocked and derided by the coastal elites even though its a rather simple concept that doesnt negate or deny evolution  itsimply is the idea that God used evolution as a tool in designing the world we see  that its still all by his design -- and I think that is how most Christians tend to think.  but  thatsaid  if you take certain scriptures absolutely literally... well  frankly  I d recommend against that  but you do you.  s
Ive been studying Bible with shepherd s chapel. we have the same philosophy when it come to people being offended  example  when we teach that God is a against homosexuality  if folks are offended by that  hey maybe they need to be offended. dont like it  sorry about ya.
I love playing the old tomb raider games I played on the ps1 I dont have it anymore my ps1 was damaged but og lara croft was very good and one of my top 10 female game characters
its very sexist to think all women hate the look of classic lara croft. Im pretty sure there s female gamers out there who love the og tomb raider games because they feel empowered playing them. its the feminazis who have a problem with lara looking beautiful because they re extremely jealous and insecure about themselves. me personally I never played the tomb raider games  but when I picture lara croft in my head I think of classic lara croft.
so your alien theory video will be the reverse of ancient aliens
whole I do appreciate your faith and beliefs  I  slightly  disagree with you on the dress code for church. I believe that you should dress your finest for your day of worship to the Lord. if you can afford nice dress clothes then you should wear them. and if all you can afford is some ripped up dirt stained jeans  then you wear the best ripped up jeans you have. that is ok too. I dont think anyone should be kicked out of church for their clothing choice  unless inappropriate ie.. nipples showing  devil worship t shirts  etc. but if you cant go just a little bit further on sunday  then what does thatsay about your relationship with God  not my place to judge though. that is between the Lord and the individual dressing for the occasion. thanks  ... just an old guys perspective.
on evolution v. creation  I ll just give a perspective. it is not necessarily a given that Christian   creationist  nor that exploring the concept and theory of evolution means denying creation. for the most part  we can observe micro evolution  which is what charles darwin observed in the way species of birds evolved in order to adapt to their environment. what can  and out to be questioned is macro evolution  because it is extremely difficult  if not impossible to observe. the case in point is the missing link between ape and man. even if it could be proven  there is still room for creation  for where did this evolutionary biological soup come from that all life had come from  where did the earth come from and how did it happen to come to form and position at exactly the right place for life to be able to exist and evolve  eventually you come to a point that all things came from nothing  and  indeed  God created all things out of nothing. as for  days   for one thing  God created the  world   the  cosmos   or the  universe   which comprises the space-time continuum. God existed before all this in a timeless reality that we eventually will too  when we die  and even in the new heavens and new earth revealed on the book of revelation. it is this timelessness by which we are told that a day for the Lord is like a thousand years. some Christians have interpreted it as meaning a literal thousand years. others have concluded it to just mean a very long time - so much so that it is timeless and eternal. the days of creation could happen over a very long time that they could be considered phases of God s creation done over God s time that is beyond time. at any rate  there are a lot of unique aspects to a sort of hybrid theory of evolution and God s creation that would take more than a comment to get into  and has been explained by much more knowledgeable people on the subject than me. but I hope it enlightens on how its possible to be both Christian and to have a certain concept on the theory of evolution.
hey mel I want to apologize for being too blunt yesterday. especially if I hurt you. but before you threw me into twitters version of gehenna I was about to bring up the scribes and pharasee s which I was actually taking into consideration about what I was talking about.as one who recognizes your love for scripture I was going to share something that I thing you might have actually appreciated. but Im got going to force the issue. but I just wanted to definately apologize. take care
just saying  being a Christian does not mean evolution cant exist. the catholic church holds no official position on evolution themselves  but they promote the idea of evolutionary creationism  in which mankind was gradually molded by a higher power to be what we are. pope pius xiI also declared  there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution.
wrong mel  the new laura make s her approachable and men feel safe

33 04 as you get bigger  which im sure you will  you are going to get more and more hate spewed at you  dont let it get to you.
creation and evolution are not mutually exclusive. not sure why or how people got that into their heads. are you saying that God couldn t have made humanity evolve from monkeys  one of the interesting questions about evolution is  when did humanity become conscious  is there a gene that was turned on that allows for it  so far there s no evidence of a consciousness gene. so you could simply argue that the timeframe in genesis isn t literal  not a hard case to make   and God created all the animals  wasn t satisfied with the results  so made humans evolve from monkeys  and at a certain point  breathed consciousness into them. that easily weaves the two together and even explains one of the biggest gaps in the theory of evolution.
they keep trying to take away all of our badass chicks!

any time anyone is talking about how people  should dress  in church  just remind them that Jesus regularly preached without any pants on.
a  commentary  you can call this vid.
I like your tattoos!
the Bible very deliberately talks of making humans and animals separate  humans having dominion over animals   so yes  saying humans came from monkeys would be a direct contradiction to the Bible.
@melonie mac go boom  hate to say it because I am a fan of yours  but its takes like this that makes the average non-religious person look down on Christians as ignorant. there are many parts of the Bible that are metaphorical. for example  its widely acknowledged that the book of job does not describe a real historical person. do you believe incest is a sin  if so  then did God force eve to sin to create the human race  or did he actually create more than just two people and its just a metaphor for the sinfulness of man  and again  the scenario I described is not contradictory. according to the Bible  he created animals first  and then he created man and gave him dominion over them. that could have just as well been him deciding to create them through evolution  only the people who wrote the Bible wouldn t have understood such a concept at the time  so they explained it in the best way they knew how. thats much easier to rectify than to ignore a ton of scientific evidence. science and religion dont need to be in conflict. they describe separate realms of the universe. science describes the physical realm  and religion describes the metaphysical. to throw one out because of the other  in either direction  is therefore foolish.
had to cut the bleach damage out lol
wow! Im voting prettiest youtuber melonie mac
who has the gravitas to tell you that you shouldn t be alive  nobody is the answer.
melonie coming to your channel is fun. youre out spoken. you dont take crap. but you still lean with God. outside of any topic at hand. you literally pop a Bible verse. when I use social media I troll a lot and might not be taken seriously. but just like you Im unapologetic with who I am and what I believe. most youtube channels is great till they start being overly woke. so much so I end up unsubscribing because its not chill.  to much woke garbage. I always thought male feminists are just super beta guys that think if they play ball to the nutty chicks they might just be able get their nut on. but in the end she ll probably just peg him. people should be confident with what they want and know their worth. youre either a dime a dozen or one of a kind. be that one of a kind. also looking forward to your video on angel s demons and aliens theory.
also good video.

why you say  dark humor  in english  becaus im from germany and if I translate the german term word to word its  black humor  so I wonder why you say  dark  in english instead of  black

one more comment about being disciples  I want to leave you with this. there are many members in the body of Christ  but everyone thinks everyone is a hand  foot or mouth. when in reality  maybe the body need a liver to filter out the crap .
if youre trash  then there will be a lot of garbage trucks being bought tomorrow so be at the road!!

the most important lesson from exodus  when God leads you out of egypt.  dont go back to egypt.
I believe God creates evolution.
some homophobes in your thread.....boom!
comment!
our God created the universe  what is there to be ashamed of
dark humor usually means like... laughing about terrible  tragic things. like 9 11 jokes  etc. I have dark humor so I usually cant joke about stuff on social media like I do irl xd
@melonie mac go boom  yes I know what the term means... my question was why the term to describe something like 9 11 jokes is  dark humor  and not  black humor ... becaus the term we use in german to describe those jokes is  schwarzer humor   black humor  and not  dunkler humor   dark humor  and I wonder why there is those difference.... like is there a link to black people who feel offended if you call ist  black humor  or something like that  or maybe  dark  and  black  have more to it in there meaning then my simple translation  what is possible because im not good in any language... not even german
@dasjup   dark humor  means exactly what  schwarzer humor  means in german. Im sure it has nothing to do with skin color. there are many german and english phrases that are very simliar  but not exactly the same.  like for example  blind as bat  in englisch vs. the german phrase  blind as a mole   blind wie ein maulwurf .
I dont believe in your God but if Im wrong I hope he blesses the fuck outta you.  3

no woman should ever be a pastor  read a kjv Bible itspeaks against just that
aliens are angels and demons    I guess  your video about aliens will be the first one I ll skip.
not trying to be offending  but have you ever research where the woke term comes from  it might make youreconsider using it in such derogatory manner. you speak about division but look to be creating more divide
for a femoid I dont listening to you talk.
well youre a party pooper
@melonie mac go boom  true.
