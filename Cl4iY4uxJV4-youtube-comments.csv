they hate chris pratt  because he s Christian  based  and because the media told the npc s to hate him. I think the latter is more commonly referred to as a system update or something. also  your hair looks great that way fam.
so let s check up on chris pratt s cancellation tally - straight - white - man - Christian - temptingly conservative - a family man and this is just what is readily visible. the far left has a serious issue with their  acceptance  because they need everyone else around them to validate their views. even if you let them be  they ll come after you. is it pettiness  misery  or a God shaped hope within themselves  I cant tell.also  nat hair melonie rocks. Imyself am giving a timeout to my hair before going back to straightening
melonie you hit the nail on the head with this one. these people hate chris because he s based and religious. congratulations marvel this is your audience now.
its tough being a Christian these days. your hair looks great.
thank you for sharing your faith openly and honestly. as followers of Christ  it is our fate to be persecuted and carry on regardless. prayers for continued strength in your journey. your hair looks fantastic  by the way.
this was an incredibly personal video today  actual bravery. the rainbow allies going after pratt are just like your crybullies...in the end they dont matter because they wont be buying thor tickets merch and they ll never be a part of melonie mac irl. praying for your succes in all things.
these individuals are never happy. even when company panders to them. it ll never be enough for those who are perpetually offended.
I love the comment  Im not giving chris pratt one cent ...  dude  y know he already got paid  right  xd
you are an amazing person melonie. keep fighting the good fight. we re right behind ya. btw  hair looks great.
thats really neat that God gave you direction with your dream  melonie! God has done that for me in the past and its encouraging to know youre on the path he wants you to be on. you obviously know it isn t easy following God s ways sometimes  but if he s guiding you than he s with you and if he s with you who can be against you  nobody. your bravery is inspiring. keep up the great work! hug  ps I have no idea why you think your hair looks crazy. it looks great! also  about the relationship stuff  I agree. Im single too  but I d rather be alone than be with someone who doesnt meet my standards  which are similar to yours a strong believer  actually attracted to them etc. . I also really dont want to be alone so hopefully I ll meet my person soon  too! d
gay man here and I love chris pratt! I dont think Ive ever heard chris pratt being homophobic  marvel changing starLord to be bI is so current year  and current year is the worst year. keep up the great work melanie  electric hair and all we still love ya!
I thought you had a photo shoot today melonie  your hair looks fantastic!  the people that hate on chris pratt dont appear to do so for any concrete reason they can state - itseems to be reflexive for them to hate on him at this point.  I imagine his being a Christian and not buckling to  woke  pressure has something to do with it.
keep going mel! you may be judged by some but you are creating a strong and loyal following on this channel. you helped me return to my faith after many years of forgetfulness. but God never forgot about me. he led me to your channel and now Im building a stronger relationship with him than I ever had before. I  as a fellow Christian cannot thank you enough. never stop booming!
Im going to listen to this video on the drive home.  I cant watch it.  I cant concentrate.  melanie is just an absolute knockout with natural wavy hair.
they hate him because he s genuinely a nice person and not because he pretends to be on twitter but because he lives it every day. they hate people like that because it reflects how pathetic  shallow and fake they are.
you do you melonie you say it how it is. you and I cant please everyone that makes who we are different in a awesome way. but when people dont respect each other and do nothing wrong and get bashed for believing something or questioning something is a no go for these woke elite people. we keep pushing and never giving up plus these social media platforms are exposing these people for who they really are more and more everyday. keep up the great work never stop being you also your hair is rebellious real awesome I noticed
melonie you do a great job of reminding people what s important. keep doing your thing and staying focused on good.
the hair is great like this! thank you for sharing and being a light in a world of darkness. Im with you on the living a life of being highly selective with dating. I am not interested in casual dating  sex  etc. I want something that leaves me not wanting. we will find who compliments ourselves and encourages our growth in life. thank you again
been a fan of chris pratt ever since he was in parks   rec.  Im sure the wokies would say andy dwyer was homophobic because he married a girl.  the more people that are like you and dont care what the wokies think  the less power they will have.  people s fear and inaction make the opposition stronger.  keep fighting  we are here to support you.itseems Im not alone when I say your hair does look fantastic
they re gonna have a real problem when chris pratt plays in the terminal list this summer. if its 1 2 like the book  they re gonna reeee!
and because he didnt join the other marvel actors with campaigning for biden
@carloscosta  he wasn t invited  but they keep repeating the  he didn t join  narrative.
remember  marvel is owned by disney  which is hell-bent   pun intended  on destroying the family. that high-pitch whine you hear is walt spinning in his grave.
@dan liberty  been calling disney  the evil empire  for over 40 years.  they have earned a much worse title  but I ll leave that to insult experts.
two facts bro
try being muslim. God bless you mate  youre not alone.
Christians have always had it tough.
@aeric abison   bullying weaker countries has always been a thing throughout the history  arabic and turkish rulers at the time had the power and advantage of technology on their side  islam  or any religion a country had at the time  was simply an excuse or tool if u will to manipulate control the common folk.also tanx for calling me a mozilimbs ! what ever means.
except that persecution your claiming your religion has put onto other religions
unless that person is not watching the new movie  heavy doubt  or is gonna pirate which I doubt these people would know the right websites with out getting riddled with malware and viruses then he will give chris pratt money.
for the one thousandth time today that you have heard this but your hair looks great! absolutely love your   stance on relationships so many women need to hear you say that and learn to wait on God to provide. keep on speaking never let anyone silence the voice God has given you!
approval sums it up in a nutshell.  people looking for validation and terrified of anyone who might judge them.  the main beef many of them have seems to be that there is someone in the universe who doesnt approve of them.  who cares   no one gets approval from everyone.  and your hair looks great.  and its nice that you openly declare your faith.
you got this melonie! I cant imagine how hard it would be to have people come after you for religion  nonetheless what your thoughts and feeling are  on different topics. I really enjoy your content  and enjoy and agree with a ton of your thoughts and feelings on character designs  female and male! its really nice and refreshing to actually hear someone talking about the details of characters that make them who they are. Im bit of a stickler for accuracy to there originals  and just good taste I d say myself  so yeah. once again I really enjoy and appreciate your content  thoughts on things  feelings on different topics  and youreading Bible verses  the more we hear the Bible the more things jump out to you and you learn. anyway  praying for you and looking forward to more content. have a great day and night - . go boom!
of course they are.  trying to ruin people is all they can do.  also  not to be weird  but I think your hair looks fine.
I love your hair  I love your energy  I love your attitude about your beliefs  I love your faith in God to have your back  but mostly  I love that you are authentic. I saw you with the critical drinker and decided to check out your channel. now I cant get enough.
we love the channel mel. might not always agree  but like the way you share your opinions   views. I know starting this channel got you even more hate   even though you decided not to care about the opinions of those trying to cancel you on social media when you began it  I know continuous hate can eventually slip through   affect you.stay strong   we appreciate you.
I completely understand the divorce thing going through it myself. Im very in front about what Im looking which probably why Ive only been on 3 2nd dates in the past 3 years. I think the biggest fears people in their 30 s face with dating again  is picking wrong again while being on a time table.
idc!!! chris pratt is a freakin national treasure. cant cancel a legend!!!
damn those wave curls look fire Im feeling that vibe.
for the haters   two words.   f    em.   those that are weak will try and bring you down to their level of misery.  those of us that have a spine  we walk our own path.  keep kicking ass because you rock.  haters gonna hate and if you hate  make your own lame ass content.
Im not sure why the algorithm originally suggested your videos to me.  I was shocked when youread a Bible verse at the end of that first video.  so I watched a few more and eventually subscribed.  I really appreciate the openness with your faith.  please keep it up.  as a Christian I wouldn t say Ive strayed from the path necessarily but I definitely sat down and stopped going down that path some time ago.  Ive had this feeling nagging at me for the last couple of years that I have to get back into the Bible and have to get back to church.  your Bible verses and openness with your faith are definitely kicking me in the pants to get back up and start walking.  again I appreciate it  please keep it up.  one verse Ive always kept with me as sort of a moto is romans 8 31.  what shall we then say to these things   if God is for us  who can be against us
mel you look gourgeous with both hairstyles. go with what makes jou happy healthy.love your energy  and no hold back attitude. ps  here since quartering shout out.
20 00 this sounds like my dating life too  I would love to be in a long term stable relationship but  finding a girl that is Christian and single in my age range is a challenge  in a way you need to be picky weed out the non compatible people early otherwise it will just be suffering
if you ve seen the trailer  you will see that it makes fun of  bromance  - starLord says something about just look into the eyes of the ones you love-  thor looks into starLord s eyes  not me! says starLord- thor says -  oh I was just listening to you!
let your hair be natural  it looks better all wavy. taking care of your hair properly is definitely a journey  I spent a long time with my scalp getting super greasy and my ends getting super dry and damaged  even though I stopped shampooing my ends  and I recently started experimenting with diluting my shampoo in an old shampoo bottle. my scalp currently produces much less oil  I have to dilute even more now to keep from drying out my ends  and my ends are never dried out anymore. Ive never had hair this soft smooth  shiny  light fluffy and tangle resistant. the shampoo they are selling us is too strong  especially if your hair is shoulder-length or longer  youre not supposed to remove all the oils because a thin layer helps protect your hair from the sun  the environment and friction.its like the crappy food they are pushing  they want to get us hooked on these unnatural products and routines that harm us
I was in a horrible marriage once. been single since and dont know if I ll ever date again. Imiss being with someone  but there are too many monsters out there and I barely survived the last one
npc   Im not giving chris pratt one cent. seeing that he lives in your head rent free anyway  I dont see the problem.
right there with you on those relationship goals. those ideals are not the easiest to find in anyone nowadays. really sucks.
I like the natural look  I thought you actually got your hair done at a salon or something. I wish they d leave chris pratt alone. I genuinely cannot think of a single time where he s ever actually been hateful to anyone. his religion  which I share  has nothing to do with anything I remember him even saying he would hope the best for those who hate him.if it wasn t for his religion being so known  no one would ever say anything poorly about him and would think of him like keanu reeves or brendan fraser
Im sorry to hear about what happened to your marriage. but Im glad you were able to move on and grow in your faith. youre an inspiration to me. I will keep you in my prayers. God is using you to encourage so many others like me. and dont lose hope! he has a man for you if its in his will. bless you  sister
melonie hot mess look is poggers
I think any age will have the difficulty to find a proper partner. good luck friend im sure if you follow Gods words he will guide you to someone special. but dont overthink too much  just let it happen naturally. sometimes we become obsessed by the things we want and not stop to think if it is whats best for us. wish you the best.
exactly. both sides of the aisle seem to have totally missed the gist of the trailer. there s probably not any homosexuality in it  at least not as a main plot point  and thor will most likely reclaim his masculinity at the end one way or another. the whole movie is clearly about him  getting his groove back   but everyone is so quick to complain that they ve totally effeminized him lol
hold up. I didn t get any  gay tension  vibes from thatscene in the trailer at all  certainly nothing I would call  flirting   it was exactly the kind of silly exchange I expected from those two characters given the rapport they ve developed in the movies they ve been in together. did Imiss something and you look great with your hair that way  definitely no need to apologize for the way you look
being the hero is dangerous. you have to confront the monster that others didnt dare to fight. so its normal to be afraid in your circumstances  but you survived many times before. God is with you even if you fail  just stand up again. thank you for your food for the soul.
your natural hair looks pretty and you rocked it! thank you also for sharing a bit of your faith  its always uplifting. remember matthew 5 15-16   neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel  but on a candlestick  and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. let your light so shine before men  that they may see your good works  and glorify your father which is in heaven.
I was in an 8 year relationship and prayed about it and say  God if Im not supposed to be in this relationship let me know  I backslid know my faith as well and Im know going back to church and getting back to reading my Bible and it feels so great
I love the way they think he ll hate playing a gay character. I think he ll have a blast
thank you for putting your faith front and center and being unapologetic about it. God bless!
if they saw the leaked pictures of the production. he was having fun. cant wait to see their melt down with the movie comes out. also chris wouldn t mind cause its called acting. not real life. like the hair by the way.
chris seems like a genuinely good dude
was that part they re talking about even gay  star Lord was talking about the people he loves  referring to his team. the thing I got from it was that thor wants to be part of the team since he hangs out with them so much.
those curls are Goddess level flex. reminds me of when I got away from the girls are icky phase in like  fourth grade. the first feature on a woman that made me go  eh giirrrrl  was dark brown  super curly hair on a girl who was like three grades ahead of me. so I shot my shot and she hit me with  thats so adorable  and laughed about the absurdity of the whole thing. kinda kicked my self esteem in the nuts  too.
hey melonie. this was a great video. its not easy to open up like you did. I understand the feeling of being a bit lonely. Ive been single for a long time now just waiting for the right girl. honestly  you might not have to wait too long because I think Imight be the guy for you. Im not trying to be arrogant but we just share a lot of the same values. I tried sending you a message on discord but I couldn t because we need to be friends so I sent you a friend request. anyway  I d love to talk with you. Im 35 by the way.
I love your channel just wanted to say that  love your talks about lara croft and I love that you talk about your faith too  recently Ive been getting back to my faith and actually reading through the Bible. also  I hear ya about the dating scene Im basically a 28-year-old hermit lol
wow  melonie sharing that very personal story. that was heavy and Im sorry you had to experience that. Im 37 and have become very jaded when it comes to thatsubject.
always be honest  dont let this cringe mob keep you down  remember they re not the majority  they re just super loud with their stupidity so itsounds worse then they are
you cant control who youre attracted to ...  every melonie mac fan blushes awkwardly .
Imust have been missing something because I didn t get the flirting scene vibes from the new thor preview. maybe I watched it too fast. on the plus side  florida politicians are pushing to remove disney special governing privileges so we might see the aggressive anti-western pushes get dialed down in the future.on dating  Im down for the big stretch and I think we re almost the exact same age. Im 36. sort of fighting my own want to start a family soon in search of the right person and I just sort of think that youre awesome. seriously dont know how you ve been in the mix for years and I just didn t stumble across you until recently. I get it that there s a lot going on out there so Im not trying to spook you. also  for some weird reason I finally broke my decade s worth of writer s block and have been pretty heavy on just letting the creative juices flow over here so thats been fun to stay busy with. you dont need a novel about where Im trying to come off but Im game for something serious if you are. just leaving it out there. I ll keep pushing for your general success and just slide you into the  crush  category if Im not the direction you want to pursue. keep being awesome. I ll pray for you as well.
love your vids as always!  your presentation s great and youre always insightful.   I was just going to suggest  for what its worth  just a small thing to do with the bit about prostitution at the end.  the left s stock in trade is euphemistic language.  george carlin  may he rest in peace  does a hilarious bit about that.   but I just meant to offer that I wouldn t play along with their linguistic chicanery.  to wit  we both know prostitution has been with us since biblical times.  it was prostitution then  and itstill is.  it isn t  sex work   bearing the implication of moral co-equality with the earning of an honest  dignified living  no matter how much the crumblers of society would like it to be  ha .  like I say not a huge deal or even a criticism really  just youre visibly better than the empty noise that comes gurgling out of people s mouths anymore
honestly love how your hair looks now. straight up 10 10! and I didn t think the whole thing wasn t a gay thing in the trailer. just seemed like a continuation of the wise ass sarcastic chemistry between thor and quill in infinity war and endgame.
always be yourself. dont let the detractors bother you. be strong. be entertaining. ps the hair is fine.stay safe. take care. have fun.
I literally complimented your hair as soon as I opened the video lol! it looks great!
I see this in anime twitter all the time. cant have two dudes share the screen for 5 seconds without calling it gay or something
sometimes two men just feel a platonic  manly  totally heterosexual love for each other. nothing wrong with that.
@Christopher duncan  especially when being  asexual  is part of the alphabet soup.
@araujo jhonatan  that man and woman are friendly.  they gonna bang.those women are friendly. they gonna bang.those men are friendly. they gonna bang.f f s
I really admire your courage to be a strong female Christian in the public space. you have encouraged me greatly these last few months. I understand your desire not to take too strong a stance on this topic because youre a very kind person who does your best to befriend all types of people. God s view on human sexuality is not a gray area and its not just a old testament teaching. paul talks about it at the very beginning of roman s. our refusal as Christians to condone  and not in a hateful way  behavior that is antithetical to God s design is a big reason why the culture is in such terrible shape. the church has really failed in this area  as well as many others . keep up the good work!
melanie  have you watched jordan peterson s breakdown of genesis   its an amazing lecture series and honestly is responsible for my return to the church.  a serious time commitment  but worthwhile.
yeah Im a Christian and this world is turning into a hell pit  Im ignoring hollywood we all should ignore hollywood melonie never give em attention good video !
melonie s confirmation that her marriage was not meant to be  hubby   y know what  I never really liked lara croft all that much.
first off  you look amazing no matter what you do with your hairsecondly  its so sad that people today cant just let others live their lives. in the end  no matter what do  God is our one and only judge   jury. the words from these  earthly judicators  mean nothing in the grand scheme of life.
your hair looks great. you dont need to do anything with it if you dont feel like it. also the volume looks awesome  too. wear an afro to remain relevant  twitter will love it. lol
I remember when all these people treated chris pratt with such disgusted behaviors. some how it escape them how evil they were behaving. Im not gonna lie. Im glad this evil from within them has fully unleashed. its sad some have to have their feelings hurt. how ever it finally exposes this long assumption that their ideology is from a place of compassion. where it really it is a veil to cover such evil they hold.
its the only way those people can feel power over others -- by cutting someone down and belittling them. after all  what is at the center of abuse  a desperation for power and control in the hearts of those who feel they lack it. this is what cancel culture is. this is what every troll  character assassin  and hater actually feels at their very core.it would just be better if they took some time to develop self-esteem and emotional maturity so they d stop victimizing themselves and demonizing others. but thats asking for a lot  sadly.
I actually think your hair looks pretty good. Ive got an insane sense of style but its not bad  least in my opinion.keep your chin up  Imet someone who is perfect for me about a month ago  planning to ask her out officially soon  dont know if it ll work out but we ll find out. there s someone for everyone.
probably the worst thing you could try to do - in this world - is to try to make everyone happy.
love the 80 s hair metal look on this one. it looks good  no lie.
the funniest part is that I dont think thatscene was even supposed to be  gay . it was thor wanting to be accepted as part of the group.
I can relate to that  especially if I just stay home for the whole day I just let my hair to be all natural lol.
you can say anything and someone somewhere will get upset about it. sticking to your guns and standing for your beliefs is incredibly hard to do out in the world as a public person. I think youre pretty brave for it. its fantastically admirable to me. also  your hair looks hot af.
what makes no sense to this day is that the loud   proud crowd on twitter are less likely to even give any of their money and the ppl that had money or care for marvel were driven away. I hope it rot and festers with the rest of hollywood.you look great
that Bible verse right here  given the culture today  was easily the most fitting verse.lots of people can rant about everything they hate about a particular actor or actress - and in doing so  they will only back up everything God s word says to be true
holy mother of based I love your take on this! keep it up!
I just wanted to be left alone.  I just wanted to play my video games  take care of my family and live my life.  they wont allow it.so here I am.   and I will leave you with this old poem that rings very true to this day. the most terrifying force of death comes from the hands of men who wanted to be left alone. they try  so very hard  to mind their own business and provide for themselves and those they love. they resist every impulse to fight back  knowing the forced and permanent change of life that will come from it. they know that the moment they fight back  their lives as they have lived them  are over. the moment the men who wanted to be left alone are forced to fight back  it is a form of suicide. they are literally killing off who they used to be. which is why  when forced to take up violence  these men who wanted to be left alone  fight with unholy vengeance against those who murdered their former lives. they fight with raw hate  and a drive that cannot be fathomed by those who are merely play-acting at politics and terror. true terror will arrive at these people s door  and they will cry  scream  and beg for mercy... but it will fall upon the deaf ears of the men who just wanted to be left alone. from the men who wanted to be left alone early 1900 s.
wavy girls unite lol. I quitstraightening my hair a few years ago.  I gave up finally because I live in a very humid place and straightening only lasted for a few hours.  I developed my own hair positivity lol. my daughter  same hair  quit also.  she is even more f it than me.
hair looks great makes you look very youthful  watched earlier videos and wondered why you changed speaking of earlier videos you should have have linked the one where you announced the divorce never have I seen someone as positive and funny as you were shows faith can overcome
amen  Christians need to be bolder in exposing sin  like Christ and the apostles did.
krill chris pratt  is for avoiding triggering twitter s  bad behavior detector .  everone knows what the twit means  but twitter s systems dont see the word  kill .
if you stand out from the mob  you get attacked by the mob. seems to be the rule of thumb on twitter these days. leave andy dwyer be.  also  love the hair.
oh melonie good plan I did that for a while too!  curly hair here  I flat ironed being the alternative dude I am and started losing hair stopped it and it came back!    lol  they hate chris pratt because he isn t part of their cult!   these same people dont say anything about scientology!
its easy to explain  they re bullies. they re just looking for someone to pick on.
your hair looks so good natural. should go with it more often!
your natural hair looks absolutely stunning gal  keep going!
your natural look is a beautiful look    rock it  melonie!
oh wow  your hair is down today and looks great!  this is a good look for you  the way it frames your eyes really accents them flatteringly.have you ever noticed how desperate to be offended wokies are   its like they go out of their way to be offended and upset  even creating strawmen to fill the void.  it makes me think of a kid that got ignored all the time and would lash out because they were desperate for attention.  you d see them a lot on the playground just being by themselves  sometimes constructing elaborate scenes with themselves  and you just think to yourself  that kid needs friends  for real.   you think about trying to be their friend  but their attitude in general just puts you off.  thats what wokies make me think of.  they virtue signal so hard because they think no one would like them if they just be normal  probably because no one  not even their parents  paid attention to them when they behaved normal.
the hair looks great!love your content.stay awesome!
how dare they. signedmrs. pratt
you say that if the hate mobs dont stop with the cancellations we will see more overcompensation   I think that is exactly what they want since that would validate their attitude and they can pretend they were right all along   I pray that the people speaking against the mob wont fall for  it   Ive seeing that happen and it doesnt help  ideology and group think are the enemies of critical thought and freedom of speech regardless of which side is coming from.
melonie s hair is nice in this one! I like the natural look!
these people are absolutely disgusting. makes you think what the parents are like.
amen!  preach melonie!  God bless!
all these tweets translate to  I hate my dad! he told me to grow up once!
here from the drinker s channel!  Im gay and I hesitate to admit it anymore because I dont want them to think Im -like that-.  it might be obvious by my appearance but I dont try to flaunt it  its not my defining trait and its no ones damn business.  people can disagree if they want  keep to themselves and I ll keep to myself.  and I ll defend chris pratt for being a decent human being  holding his ground  and not caving into the mob even if he did disagree with being gay.  its not like he s advocating for burning gay people  he s just Christian.  pot meet kettle  youre the very thing youre condemning dummy.
I look like I got electrocuted  more like an electrocutie
I love  chris pratt as a human and an actor. I went to see the movie and within the first half hour  I already had enough. after seeing all the thor movies Ive come to know what to expect from thor.  thor in this movie was the complete opposite of how he has been up to this movie. and having a build up for thor just to have jane come in to overshadow thor.  Im done for a while with all things disney.
melonie the hair looks great. you definitely nailed it on the head they hate chris pratt.
I know this video is old af  but that is the best hair Ive seen on melonie!
crab lobster bucket syndrome is real  man. misery loves company
@slick ric  sure seems that way.
I agree  it brings out here eyes verry well.
straight saviors  is hecking great
however you do your hair is fine. all up to you. your content is still enjoyable. personally I like this more natural look better
can I just say Im blown away by how beautiful your hair is in this video
good luck dating in this environment  Ive stayed single since my 6 month stupidity marriage 3 1 2 years ago. Ive just focused on income and accomplishing goals  happier and more successful than when I was trying to date.
really think romans 1 hits this subject where it needs to hit. I get hate from from a lot of people when pointing this chapter out when it comes to living life with thatsin. get called homophibic because of it. I hate all sin equally. granted I dont hate people who sin because I sin too. I get  bickered at by people who say they are Christian from time to time for pointing this chapter out. so sad that people label Christians as hateful because of their walk. but this is one of the stepping stones I think God gives us in our walk.
I really hope taika waititI comes out and tells folks they re just bros and says chris pratt s an upstanding guy.
we need a revolution lol bc we can barely talk without someone getting offended
the hair looks cute.  I have normally wavy curly hair and I hate dealing with it but yours looks good.  it gives you a scrappy look.
melonie   to thine own self be true.
ditto to all your relationship advice
found your channels through the critical drinker. always great to find a fellow Christian my age taking a stand for truth here on this platform.you may say its not your business what the lgbtqetc people do with their sex lives  but they are out to make it your business. they will make everyone accept everything they say  or be crushed. the fact you had to make this channel shows that their hounds are on to you.
love chris pratt
melonie   wear your hair however you want.  it is beautiful.
its not my business to force people to not do things I dont believe in but its also none of their business to make me believe what they believe in or do things I dont believe in.
I think your hair looks cute. as a Christian  I am in this world but not of it. we are called to love one another  and their anger for my beliefs doesnt phase me. not my circus. not my monkeys.
your hair looks good like that.couldn t agree more.  the chris pratt hate is rediculous.  just because he doesnt approve of the lifestyle doesnt mean hes a homophobe.Im sure many of the people Christ preached to lived lifestyles he didn t approve of  but he still loved all of them.
maybe he should go make movies with daily wire after this.
if taika doesnt even know that chris pratt hater  I guess he hasn t figured out that there are 7.9 billion people in the world and 99.99999999999  of them doesnt know he exists or even care.
I actually thought your hair and you obviously  looked great. it looks like you just come out of the water and dried your hair after a swim!chris pratt has never used any slurs the way they are accusing him.hell  he got a lot of hate from people about his church  bringing up things his church had made statements on and retracted later- like all organizations have as society has moved forward  ten to fifteen years before he joined it.
people regardless of religion always have something to say about everything. everyone has opinions but forcing opinions or views on people is what I cant stand. its up to us to be what we want to be and if society doesnt like it thats their problem. humanity means to be together not to agree on everything! we are individuals not drones lol.
right  its clearly poking fun at bromance  thor and starLord already had a rivalry thing going in their last films together and this is just building on that
what gets me is that they just attribute homophobia to chris pratt instead of trying to figure out whether or not he himself is homophobic. for some reason  its been seen as  logical  online that if you even vaguely interact with someone who is homophobic  then you are too. now  if chris pratt actually is homophobic  thats worth criticizing him for. from how I understand  chris donated to a church with homophobic views but if chris frequently participates at this church  it makes sense to donate to the church you usually go to.it also gives me the same vibes as the internet turning on scott cawthon because people were surprised that a white man  married and has two kids in texas and is an open Christian to the point where he made Christian themed games  leans republican and donates to republican politicians. he got hit with the   homophobic  label even though itseemed he was primarily donating based on immigration and border security issues.
weird I was just telling the gf the other day how wokies hate chris because he s Christian she cant deny it now
your hair looks gorgeous I like it better that way thank you for all the awesome content
your awesome keep up the great work
just letting you know the Bible verse at the end of your videos was the main reason I subscribed. keep up the good work. youre a light that is definitely needed.  john 15 18  if the world hate you  ye know that it hated me before it hated you. and your natural hair is your glory. dont hate on it.  1 corinthians 11 15
wait  youre libertarian ! ! vice chair of my state lp here.edit  idk why Im so excited. I guess we re a small group amd its always fun to find others like us  especially cool people.
I gotta say  I really like the hair in this one. I like itstraight too  but I was not expecting that at the open of this vid.
thats your natural hair  it looks great on you! I thought you got a perm done at first  d
chris pratt is a cool dude.
your hair in this vid is majestic  like a bloody lion s mane. I dig it!
your hair looks great. I love your work.
seeing this in hindsight it is hilarious that the supposedly gay scene is not even in the movie.
I adore your hair  it looks amazing with those waves in it.
the internet is the internet.  chris pratt is awesome.  the end.
loving the hair. how ya feel about short  stocky white guys  let s make this happen
love the hair. I want that 80s hair to come back. give me ripley from alien!!!
I dont understand this  the scene made it look like thor was desperate for the feeling of someone carrying about him. this is right after his depression era fat thor  there was nothing gay about it  just wanted the friendship type of love.your hair looks cute
you look absolutely stunning with your natural hair
you should sell a t shirt thatsays what the crap on it I would totally buy it and wear it.
my 2 cents - your natural hair looks super cute.
chris pratt is easily one of my favorite actors and all the crazy woke people ain t gonna change that.
damn melanie with the big hair about knocked me dead   wow
they hate him because if you are Christian or conservative  and you are successful   that looks poorly on them. a person showing control and letting insults roll off you back only warrants more punishment from them to prove you wrong.  long-suffering sux
lol.  uhh these people have no lifes. have they never heard of bromance also youre hair looks good!
your hair looks better in its natural state imo.dont fear the 80 s hair ... it is still best hair
loving the new look
after all the videos its about time your hair goes boom.
chris pratt would still eat whether he did it or not because he hunts for all his food
the woke can woke
I think people here care more about your hair than they do the actual video content.  the natural look never fails..as for homosexual attraction  youre right  we dont have control over who we are attracted to  but we re still called to obey God s will to the best of our ability. I dont think there s room for re-interpretation of that lifestyle for Christians  not in the old or new testaments. some seem convinced  but romans 1 is pretty clear  and even Jesus affirms that marriage is one man plus one woman.
the more masculine the man  especially if he has no comment on their idiotic causes  the more they will come for him.
they hate him cuz they cant be him!
your hair looks nice like that.keep it up love  from a fellow native irish lolpraise Jesus.
thank you for reading my comment  melonie!
you should keep giving your hair a break. it looks great that way. when the world hates you and you feel all alone remember that you are in the best of company for the world hated Jesus and he will always be with you. you are not alone.I ll be praying for you. if you have a chance please pray for my brother. he really needs it right now.thanks and keep booming
its comical. chris pratt is the monster under these peoples bed.
he stands for everything they hate. of course they hate him.
your hair looks nice melonie
your hair looks cute this way. natural is better anyways!
people seem to forget that wokeness was preceded by attacks on religion. the same people who mocked Christians in film and tv throughout the 80s and 90s then felt emboldened to attack all morals stemming from biblical and judeo-Christian values in the 2000s and 2010s. I remember learning to  filter  the hatred of my faith subliminally while watching movies as a child  I realized very quickly that if an onscreen character identified as Christian  they would inevitably be revealed to be a bigot  psychopath  or idiot. I think thats why  for a long time  I didn t even notice how awful modern movies were becoming   I ll be honest  it even took me a couple years to start getting angry after repeated viewings of the last jedI  because I was so used to tuning out stupid and hateful themes in order to enjoy the rest of the movie. chris pratt has never appeared to be anything other than a kind  sweet  patriotic  and very funny man  and  honestly  as a professional actor  it wouldn t surprise me if he one day took on the role of a gay man in a film. this kind of hate can only be fought with truth and real love. God bless chris pratt. and melonie mac.
keep your hair like this looks good
melonie just got back from the 80s
dear lovely person thats reading this  we may not know each other but I wish you all the best in life!   I believe in you! love - nat
great video. God bless you
I dont know the whole situation  I dont think its necessary homophobic if he didn t want to do the scene.if he was uncomfortable with the scene  I dont think its wrong for him to voice his opinion to their director. also maybe he felt it didn t make sense to the character. if someone asked camila to flirt with sam in tomb raider then I d be upset with that. that doesnt make me homophobic  just sometimes it doesnt make sense for the character.
the wavy hair looks great!
call me crazy  but I prefer your hair like that  it has attitude     I hear ya about dating  Im the same way  really picky about dating due to past mistakes. at this point Im willing to die alone instead of being in relationship thats not my thing but we shall see. good luck to you  hope you find a match
starting off  I actually like the hair better like that! but thats just me. its crazy how they hate a man for being religious and default to him being evil because he is white  I do not understand it. phobia implies fear. phobia is not the same as disagree. I believe people can do their own thing and I dont care what people do in their bedroom. but arachnophobia means a fear of spiders  not a disagreement about the belief of spiders.
they hate him because he s attractive and happy.
you look lovely melonie  3
hey  mel! quite a cute look  curly hair suits you  imho.
imagine if the roles were reversed. it would be defcon 1.
it is okay if you dont platinum Christianity.  everyone s loadout is different.  what is important is you keep playing.
dont forget about joshua s bro caleb. he was pretty a ight  and Im named after him
when I watched the new thor trailer. I didn t see a gay moment between star Lord and thor. more like thor wanting to be part of peters guardian family  in a kinda funny way. plus I dont think chris pratt has ever said anything anti-gay. he s just a Christian and a real nice guy. anyways  love the videos  keep up the good work and God bless you melonie mac.
nothing wrong with how your hair looks.
what  no no  my first thought was  wow mel is looking really good today .
love the hair!
boom    you ll find your match  might take a while though so dont lose hope. Im still looking 9 years after a divorce and I know how it is.
that hair looks great.
its easy to get them into this bs game. just ask what would they say if it was an actor who s openly faithful to islam and refused to do some scene because it is haram
prat s a mega giga chad and they hate him for it.
thor was just trying to friendly and get some guy bonding. they literally have thor kiss a women in the preview.
chris is awesome   a Christian.
first thing I said when I saw you on the screen   great looking hair  seriously
hair is on point!
chris pratt is hated so vehemently by the woke mob for being who he is. Im kind of jealous.
they dont like him cos they re jealous  he s a normal good looking white guy  popular  successful etc. everything the weirdos wish they could be
its funny how people who claim to be the most  inclusive  say and do some of the most vicious things to people who simply dont have the exact same world views as they do.
I like your hair natural ... just shows off your good genes.
I love your hair as much as I hate woke hypocrisy.
I love that look   you look stunnig!
there is a lot of straightaphobia as well.
I dont understand people who hate chris pratt. I know why they do  untrue as it is  but its like hating ryan reynolds or rdj. there are some people you just have to smile at
lol funny intro to the first video I  see love it.p.s. put olive oil in your hair for an hour before washing  natural hydration.
Im calling it now. thatscene is just a misdirect to build hype  when thatscene is probably nothing more than thor being silly and wanting attention from the guardians  like at the end of endgame. disney does this all the time. remember when we thought c-3po was dead for sure with his heartwarming speech in the star wars ep. ix trailer  yeaaaahhh .
imo natural hair is much more attractive than mechanically chemically thermally straightened hair.  its too bad imo that most women feel guilty bad ugly when they dont straighten their hair.  modern society is messed up.  I really love melonie s hair.
I think I like your natural hair better than when you straighten it. but you look good either way
melonie  chris pratt would have nothing against you  the same way he has nothing against gay people... he literaly doesnt have nothing against anyone  he is a nice guy  and he support that everyone live their lives in the way they feel happy  he isnt a judgmental person.
I wish chris pratt was in every movie just to piss off the pronoun patrol.
1 vote for the wavy hair.  looks great.
gigachad
@kingslayer  sorry  auto correct.
given how he s getting more works  I would say thats quite possible. hollywood cant really throw dirt on him without ousting their bias  and he s a good actor  which means money
@araujo jhonatan  and he s a box office draw  which is the important part  much  much more important than being good at acting.
your hair looks great just leave it natural. chris is Christian you dont have to say any more  they hate him.
chris pratt will be all right his project tomorrow war did quite well.  he gets all the flack because of his church.  just think of the detractors as demons on earth since it does feel like the end times.  Im quite found of ephesians 6 11.  may your days be blessed.
they wanna be a victim so badly
gosh youre pretty. youre hair looks dope!
14 15 you can call it  Bible go boom
the very essence of liberty is people doing things that you dont agree with.
man!!! chris pratt is awesome. the funniest thing is that if people want to boycott him and take his paycheck away  he already knows how to live off the land. he ll just hunt more animals and eat more meat. cut down trees etc. they wanna force him to do what they hate. haha. also  why do people think they know taika and think that he would  force  chris to do anything  also  star Lord literally sleeps with aliens. haha. why is  the mob  so obsessed with what people  fictional or not  do with their nethers
not too much in age   awww c mon Im almost fifty but Im really immature!!I ll be at the elvis chapel in vegas awaiting your inevitable response.
steps to finding a Godly husband  seek Christ and be satisfied being alone in him  ask to be the best wife for the best man. boom. God will make it happen. worked for me. I worked on my relationship with God. I prayed for God to prepare me for my wife to make her life better and more Godly and God brought me the best woman ever. we met at church and got married in less than a year. 8 years in and its getting better. she loves Christian death metal like I do  loves zelda like I do  and she s a hot fit goth with all the physical features I love.  she s an amazing mom and wife and teaches kids at church. Im supremely satisfied in Christ and the lady he gave me and the daughter he gave me are just icing on the cake. now sometimes God wants us to be single forever and we have to know thats a super free and solid life too.
keep the hair natural . looks great.
I just saw you making good conversation with the drinker  so I am here to like and subscribe. in a not-specifically-religious sense  I think we are seeing a lot of vengeful and unforgiving souls  lacking foundation and especially a healthy sense of proportion  instantly triggered by any tiny infractions of their morality of the moment.   they would be pitifully comical  except that their witch-burning hysteria makes them very dangerous. chris pratt seems like a good and decent man  if cloning was a thing we could have more of him and make the world a happier place.

if they make hemsworth and pratt kiss  and they do it.... game over
people being against the gay lifestyle over their beliefs is still kind of dangerous in a world where people are still being killed for simply being gay  in the us and other areas
find someone where you are their lara croft
good thing Christianity is based on loving your enemies over yourself with the understanding that u will be persecuted. in fact its more super effective than giving them the satisfaction of knowing they made you mad. its like dumping hot coals on their heads  as scripture says.
elliot paige hates anything that goes against his worldview.
hmmm chris better run from that.
every one sins and nobody is perfect thats why God came down and died for our sins. look at david he loved God so much but be sinned and God still loved him  but disciplined him. also your hair looks good
actually  your hair looks great here.
you mean ellen page and her worldview
I dont normally comment on the yt s looks  but I thought this was a good look for you. as for pratt  these idiots do this every few weeks with this guy because he might be conservative. I dont know if he is and I wouldn t be surprised if he weren t  but these people are always this childish.
its not about who is against you. its about who is for you. God is for you when you do his will in anything.romans 8 31   what shall we then say to these things  if God be for us  who can be against us  we oppose this new woke world because wokeness is antithetical to what God wants us to be. sure  men will hate us  but we will be rewarded with heavenly treasures for resisting the world s opinions on everything thats going on right now.
I like the natural look more then when you straighten it. not that itshould matter how I like your hair.
well melonie  you know we could always praise God  have a small family farm  be carnivores  make some babies  play some video games together  and shoot some guns. but youre all the way over in texas!
itsucks these people attack others for being Christian or even conservative  tho chris pratt never even said he was a conservative  but they attack him. I hope these people get a dose of karma. keep up the great work!
people today no longer want actors play roles  they want a gay character be played by a gay actor and so on which for me defeats the whole purpose of acting and ends with  actors  who basically play the same character in every movie  like for example ryan reynolds  I do like him  but all the roles he seems to get lately are the wise cracking kind of hero like he was in deadpool.a lot of the hate for chris pratt also seems to come from the fact he not got involved with the elections in us  he never stated any opinion on who he thinks should be elected  he simply stayed neutral and kept his opinion to himself  but today not speaking up in either direction is just as bad as stating what you think.
the biggest problem with Christians  trying to do Jesus  job for him. I guess they re looking for approval. and I say that as a Christian. just because youre  saved  doesnt mean youre free of sin. youre still alive and therefore  still swimming in sin. Christians need to be more forgiving  like the dude they claim to follow.
I like the  more natural  melonie mac. just saying.
the biggest problem with the left is they dont want to leave you alone  let you have your own thoughts and beliefs. they need to force you to accept and promote their beliefs. dont feel bad for chris  he is one of those ceo Christians. Christmas  easter only. cant truly believe if you are a democrat your whole life.
omg the natural melanie is looking hot!!
npcs hate the thing because the corporatocracy downloads their patch every day to hate the thing.edit  there are no differences between new and old testaments regarding homosexuality as a sin.
a parphrased Bible  make a book of paraphrased verses for the modern generation while making it funny  and I would buy the heck out of that.
melonie I saw tweets of moviebob trying to call you out ignore him he is a male feminst who was in cohorts with anita sarkessian trying to  bring social justice into games
as far as I csn tell its all because ellen page said his church was homophobic. however I havent found any instances of chris actually being homophobic.  these people attacking him are outrageously embarrassing .  I am a trans woman and very much agree that thistype of behavior only hurts lgbt acceptance.
you look great! also these ppl are so cringe
nothing has changed from ot to nt on homosexuality.  ceremonial law was overturned  civil law was ended  but moral law is not only still in place but even more stringent because jc says it not just our actions that matter  but also our thoughts and intentions.  the nt is very clear on homosexuality  no gray area.
I was listening to you during my workout  which is just the worst time because I forget all my comments by the time I wrap up. anyway  I dont know what trailer the wokies were watching but pratt was clearly looking at his crew. if they wanted to  divine  some sort or homosexual undertone from that  itshould have been from the way he was looking at the big purple dude.the whole narrative around pratt is just so ridiculous on its face. one can be at the same time pro-traditional marriage without being anti-homosexuality. that kind of  if you aren t with me  youre against me  mentality feels way too close to the kind of marxism in which critical social theories are rooted. and we know how well that has worked to unite us...
that one person who said  only chris pratt would refuse to have a gay moment with thor.  ...really  only him  nobody else who isn t gay or bi
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unGodliness and unrighteousness of men  who suppress the truth in unrighteousness  because what may be known of God is manifest in them  for God has shown it to them. therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness  in the lusts of their hearts  to dishonor their bodies among themselves  who exchanged the truth of God for the lie  and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator  who is blessed forever. amen. for this reason God gave them up to vile passions. for even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. likewise also the men  leaving the natural use of the woman  burned in their lust for one another  men with men committing what is shameful  and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge  God gave them over to a debased mind  to do those things which are not fitting  being filled with all unrighteousness  sexual immorality  wickedness  covetousness  maliciousness  full of envy  murder  strife  deceit  evil-mindedness  they are whisperers  backbiters  haters of God  violent  proud  boasters  inventors of evil things  disobedient to parents  undiscerning  untrustworthy  unloving  unforgiving  unmerciful  who  knowing the righteous judgment of God  that those who practice such things are deserving of death  not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them. romans 1 18 - 19    24 - 32when it comes to what the holy spiritsays about the issue of non-heterosexual  non-monogamous  extramarital sexual activity  there s no gray area  mel  but definitely study it for yourself. I know you are big on libertarian values  but the attitude of  live and let live  doesnt go very far with the Bible. this is not at all in the sense of taking away anyone s rights or even preventing or protesting things like gay marriage. in that case as a Christ follower I say  if it gets voted in  so be it  but I wont be voting for it. however  when the subject comes up  anyone following God is commanded to be truthful and to be faithful to what God teaches and commands  and this includes saying   no  I dont agree with that lifestyle   no matter what it is or who Im talking to.it doesnt change the fact that we need to love on people and share the gospel with them  in fact we need to do it all the more because we realize the danger people are in when their hearts are so hardened toward God that they dont care what he says about sexuality or why he made it. we are at no point called to hate or hurt sexually deviant people. the mosaic law to stone homosexuals was part of many other strict laws intended to preserve the nation of israel and to emphasize in an extreme way the way God wants his people to live  because that was the way to get their attention in such a primitive time. now we are definitely not called to stone anyone  but the Bible is clear about who is under God s wrath  and we need to be honest about it whenever the time comesmuch like you  I also spent most of my 20s in liberal environments  just kind of going along with everyone else and not doing anything that would get me rejected by the  cool  crowd  but Im sure you know that at some point we have to be okay with people abandoning us for being faithful to God and his word. you ve discussed that in other videos  so its definitely nothing new for you. I ll continue praying for your faithfulness and continued growth in Christ  thank you for this video! God blessps hair looks beautiful! I prefer wavy hair way more than straight  personally
jealousy and hate now rules the roost when it comes to people and faith.....but these same people who will cry like a baby when confronted and will run like roaches in the light!!  for you are still of the flesh. for while there is jealousy and strife among you  are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way   1 corinthians 3 3
didn t moviebob also defend netflix cuties
@alex  he did
this guy is a clown. so-called media personality. Ive lived in boston all my life  never heard of him
@visitor   I live in providence I visited boston my grandparents are from there its cool city but man thank goodness I have never met blob chipman personally
beware of cinemaroberto!
I ll never understand the constant attack on Christianity when to this day homosexuality is still viewed as punishable by death in certain parts of islamic belief. its insane.
okay.... I know there is a ton of hate for chris pratt  but has he done anything different than other movie stars  cheat on spouse  voice his beliefs  open about his religion  lives in the rich and famous would so maybe a bit delusional......they are almost all do this. its the famous super star condition. if he doesnt want to play a game role thats his choice  and itseems like he is going to go ahead with the role so what s the deal  I am all for gay characters. hell Ive been wanting more of them  but it all seems to be shoved in our faces as some kind of agenda and it always feels preachy  when itshould just be normal.
the hair looks great. very punk rock.
homosexuality never changed throughout the Bible.the nt is full of passages speaking against homosexuality.while Jesus himself never directly said  homosexuality is wrong  he does reiterate thatsex outside of marriage is wrong and he defines marriage as being between 1 man and 1 woman.Im not saying we should hate homosexual people nor try to force them to change nor subjugate them nor anything like that.Im simply pointing out that its not an ot vs nt issue.
actually prefer the hair this way
I dont water down the word of God  nor cherry-pick it. I live by the whole word of God  the entire holy Bible. people on all sides have mocked me  slandered me  and attacked my character. I obey God first and last. I will not debate this. I will not argue it with anyone.
ok  melonie. I like you  especially your Bible verse of the day. but not accepting homosexuality is not an old testament thing. it is clearly mentioned in several verses in the new testament that it is wrong  and they will not enter heaven. this applies to all unrepentant sinners. not caring about someone s eternal destination is not loving. having said that  do not judge selfrighteously.
I like the way your hair looks today.
you seemed a little uncertain on God s stance on homosexuality. the Bible is clear. it is a sin. in leviticus  it is described as just as punishable as infidelity. Jesus s sacrifices cleanses all. so a gay man woman who gives their heart to Christ is just as saved as you or i.
you look gorgeous with this hair
far as I learned growing up lutheran   God loves gay people  hates gay sex.  its about separating the sin from the sinner.  we were commanded to  be fruitful and multiply .  maybe something was lost in translation
your hair looks very nice  either way.
I like the hair better this way  looks big !
hair is fine that way  good to let it breath.
yes keep wearing your hair like that  dayum gurl
not simping but your hair looks good like that.
I like this natural look. its really hot.

love the natural hair...
hey mel. I like your hair that way. good look.

not trying to simp  but your hair looks better like this. just fyi.
because he dont fit there cookie cutter they want to throw him out with the trash.
I thought you had styled your hair to get it to look the way it does naturally.  I didn t get gay vibes from the trailer. these people are weird same kind of  people that write read fan fiction about bucky   captain america being gay lovers.
I think they watched a completely different trailer than I did. where s this supposed gay scene
wtf is wrong with these folk...
wtf is going on here again  chris pratt is a funny dude and a good actor. I really dont get  why someone should try to cancel him.better cancel amber heard instead.
I like your hair.
hey good morning melonie I just want to tell you that I am sorry this is very late from yesterday but I just want to let you know that and tell you that I really like chris pratt bc he was great with newer jurassic park movies and he is going to be great in the new jurassic park domination movie coming out to theater s this year and so I just want to tell you that I dont care what other woke people say about chris pratt but I think that he is a great actor and he is great in newer jurassic park movies  ok melonie. anyway I hope you agree with me on this topic  ok melonie. anyway again I just want to tell you that I am so sorry that this is very late but I will be prepared for new video on time  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great evening last night with your pets and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home with your pets and at the gym too  ok melonie.
uhhh yo hair on point girl
I like chris hemsworth and chris pratt but the mcu ended with endgame for me. the only thing Ive watched that involved marvel since  was spider-man.
when these poor creatures would know how less chris pratt  probably  cares for crap like this  they would surely end themselves
hair looks good actually. swear I am not simping lol. also should note the world hates us Christians.
they ve made up a version of chris pratt in their heads just so they can hate on another white  Christian man. smh
they re not gonna call the muslims homophobic  they dont wanna get thrown off of buildings. all jokes aside looking great today with the natural hair
keep.  the.  hair.  you and pokimane need to keep your curly hair.  and you would look killer with wavy blunt bangs cut just above the eyes.  I know Im fan girling over this  but please get bangs and keep the curls.
chris pratt is not a homophobe. these trolls just need someone to hate.
natural hair
you look amazing
what does unequally joked mean  like you dont have the same values or if you arent the same
I like the hair
oh nice hair.
you look great.  liking the do.
ur great melonie  defend ur Christianity and faith from people that dont make sense  also  melon is in your name  funny fruit
I just watched the clip. so thats it  thats the big controversy    thor was f ing with starLord. like. friends. do.  not sure why this is even being discussed.
just speaking as a non-Christian  I would adore a melonie-paraphrased audio Bible. shut up and take my money!oh  also  thanks for the lovely videos.
the woke mob tries to cancel chris pratt like every 5 months  to no success. but Im not going to see this movie anyways  not because chris pratt is in it. its because its a disney made movie and disney needs to die.liked chris pratt in the magnificent seven remake  he s no steve mcqueen. but him and denzel washington worked well together with the rest of the cast.
f ck s sake!
the Bible tells Christians not to be unequally yoked  as in dont marry outside the faith
what s more crazy is that nobody knows what chris s political views are. and whatever it is  its none of our damn business!!! the same goes for his family. thats personal! keep your nosey  out of it!!!
casual hook ups also go against Christian morals lol

left wing  I am not watching this movie because I hate chris pratt.right wing  I am not watching this movie because I hate disney corp.welp  guess nobody is gonna watch it but disney still manages to blame on white men because that is how hollywood deals with movie flops.
marriage has historically been a religious institution for thousands of years. state  government  control of religion via state legislation regarding marriage  licensing taxing  forced  equality   etc  is a very new concept in a historical context  only going back less than 200 years in the western world. millennia ago  political leaders had to ask their religious leaders for permission blessing to marry. now political leaders force religious organizations to follow the message  to the point that they are threatening to shut down religious charities through discrimination by revoking their charitable organization status   robbing them of their donations   properties. the original marriage licenses in the usa were instituted by the democrats in the jim crow south as a means of criminalizing interracial marriages and retaliating against free black americans. why is government trying to destroy all religious institutions except for those of a specific religion  get government out of religion. as for the scene in thor  l t  it reminds me of high school   college dipshittery that was fairly common in the 1980s   1990s  especially among  punk rock   culture.  I wouldn t be surprised if the scene that these lunatics are screeching about was at least half improvised by chris   chris  or was even a product of their own making. it almost seems to me that there is an inside joke that we re all missing  and the wokeists are missing itso badly that its causing them to show their raging insanity. as for the differences between the old   new testaments  there is a theological explanation  and there is a historical explanation. neither of them alone is really solid  but some of the gaps in each can be filled by the other. I think that jordan peterson does a decent job of explaining the historical significance of the old testament at the start of his biblical lecture series on the book of genesis. the first several books of the old testament are made up of stories   historical accounts from various tribes which had merged over time. the first few books of the new testament are individual accounts of events that those individuals claim to have witnessed  with some parts being obvious secondhand accountings.
skip the hair defense intros
stop worshipping or even playing attention to people in front of a camera. from a life perspective he isn t a good person from his marriage transgressions  bailing out seems what people are efficient in. I continue my days as normal as can be  I acknowledge things but dont obsess over them cause what value does it bring me
I think the all natural melonie looks great  I want to say she looks hot  but thats misogynistic   demeaning now
matthew 5 10-12 blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you  and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. rejoice and be glad  for your reward in heaven is great  for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
23 16 well  u likely already know this one  but just in case  remember mt 5.11-12 blessed are you when people insult you  persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.rejoice and be glad  because great is your reward in heaven  for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. if you bothering them is because of Jesus  feel glad  not sad.in fact  this is a big thing that differentiates you from others doing similar kind of content  so just go for it!...also obligatory  cool hair  comment  haha
he committed the cardinal sin of not being ultra left.therefore he must never be allowed work as an actor. sounds normal to me.
hair looks damn good. these people are obsessed with gayness aren t they  very sad.
crap rolls down-hill and if you always go with the flow  you ll end up in the sewer with the rest of the turds.
im looking foward to jane foster and mjolnir   dont care about religion sex gender politics ect.  thor losing his hammer in the comics is a cool story .personally dont care what actors think or do  show up do your job or f off. its a story from a comic base on nordic myth  for crying out loud get a grip. writting personnal attacks on the internet is for   insert whatever triggers you most  type of people.
just so you know its not only an old testament thing. Jesus said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife  and the two shall become one flesh   6 so they are no longer two  but one flesh. what therefore God has joined together  let no man separate.  he s talking about marriage here.
when wasn t there gay bI representation in media... seriously. star trek was doing it int eh 70s.
I am very single too  what up
who cares what these people think   I dont understand why they listen to these weirdos
how dare Christ pratt be Christian! let the sjws watch their pagan Gods movie in peace lol. melonie s hair has more depth than most disney marvel characters.
star-Lord and thor are  looking at each other   and looks make you gay now   nonsexual   asexual  is part of the lgbtqiiaa  -- alphabet soup  relationships between men aren t possible if they kissed  then we could talk.  but people are supposed so  as forbes put it   starved for gay representation  they are grasping at any straw they find.and strangely  did nobody get their undies in a bunch over marvel calling thor  lady thor    remember that marvel was adamant that when jane became thor she wasn t  female thor  or  lady thor   but simply  thor   the thor  and not a temporary replacement  not just someone who got the power of thor because they picked up his hammer  which had happened in the past on more than one occasion . for making peter sic  kind gay   wut   sorry  even if thor was gay  and there hasn t been any evidence of even the possibility   if some gay dude looked at me  flirtingly   that wouldn t make me even kinda gay.they all lost their fuckin  minds.the  canonically gay  du  ga  person  -   he has gone so far down this fantasy road thatshe now believes  obviously  thatstar-Lord peter quill is canonically gay.
exactly
is because he is Christian and antI abortion. your hair looks lush btw.
want to know who  besides Jesus  is the best character in the whole Bible noah - because he had the best arc k
its as easy as God made them male and female and when marriage is talked about  its always between a man and a woman. I do think gay and trans people along all the others etc should be treated right  but marriage is something God created so  its up to him.
so what if some one is homophobic  ! its not against the law  what s next   being hetero sexual is being homophobic
being against gayness or being bI is not an old testament thing lady its a God thing if jah wanted men to mate why bother creating woman.
youreally think its just an old testament issue  I implore you to truly do more research sister.
4 40 but they should accept it. it doesnt matter if a person likes queer people  as long as everyone accepts queer people everything is cool imo.
you do you but you know that the Bible was made by the romans right 300 years after Jesus died so thats what youre following roman doctrine and the scripture they resided to put in the Bible
