for a modern audience  the scariest thing real audiences ever heard
we need games for an  old school audience.
the  modern audience  is the scariest thing in gaming right now!
the horror genre wasn t made to be scary  it was made to be inclusive
the moment I hear  made for modern audiences  all my hopes and expectations go out the window.
we re living in the worst timeline  aren t we
too much horror in this horror game  why was the person who raised this objection not handed a broom and told  this is you now
Im guessing that in addition to making the game not scary  they likely have made the game a lot easier to finish.
considering the dark subject matter in silent hill 2 which made the game such a memorable experience. I been waiting so long for this and hearing this just want to make me make a horror game that pushes the limits as that did back in the early 2000s.   man thats why we need to gate keep these thing like anime  video games  entertainment in general.
a few years ago I bought silent hill 2 at a salvation army thrift store  and I am really glad I did after seeing this video. I got it with the instruction booklet  and in near mint condition. whoever donated it there probably didn t play it very much  and probably didn t realize that you can make a lot of money by selling it online.
my first mistake was getting excited when I am more than aware what the modern state of games are. that was on me.
probably why I love elden ring so much.  here s a tough game  if you suck  get better.
the  once was a game  meme is fairly accurate.
its called  inclusivity   melonie! horror games should be for people who dont like horror games  too!
cant wait to see them add minimap  crafting system and main character adding quips like  so let me get this straight  Im in so kind of other world in this silent hill  tm  town
well guess I ll be passing on this remake  thanks konami
so many good memories of silent hill 2. to be honest  silent hill 2 wasn t thatscary but it was certainly creepy and bizarre.
people already had mixed feelings about the the sh2 remake given bloober team s track record with horror games usually being a bitsubpar but after hearing this it ll just make people wanna play and preserve the original game more. cuz what made the resident evil remakes work so well is that they remained faithful to the source material while mainly just updating the controls and graphics.
all of the best silent hill games were the in house japanese developed titles. there s simply a different style of horror between cultures which I think draws a lot of people to games like silent hill or fatal frame thats doesnt translate well when a us or other western developer tries to emulate it. I already had low hopes for the title and now my expectations might as well be zero
I remember when remakes were something I was excited for and looked forward too.. then the term  updated for modern audiences  reared its head over the years and that ended up being code for we are p ssing and sh tting all over what made your childhood experience great.
post-modern audience  would be more accurate.
dude I was literally horrified when I saw the title of video
pregnant joker was more terrifying than normal joker
a lot of blame goes to the nintendo wiI and the nintendo ds.  they brought the casual audience to gaming.  and then the handheld moved on to mobile devices.  the casual audience ruins industries.
exactly so in other words they re saying f    the generations of the 80s 90s and early 2000s thats what they re saying that is why I will be going to school I will be learning on how to be an entrepreneur and I will be starting my own gaming company because I am sick of this crap
@michael coulter  count me in lol
@as above so below  I have been dreaming about it for years I got a name for it phoenix gameing inc the motto where true passion for video games rises from the ashes
@michael coulter  yeah so wait what  10 to 20 years to see anything substantial from you
@chandler burse   yes you will
at least fromsoft has our backs.
you mean the daily wire of video game studios
normal  audience
this  I wish any developer would promote their stuff for  old school audience  or  for hardcore gamers  or just for  dedicated fans . you can only hear those statement in japan.
there are definitely  boomer shooters  if you happen to be an fps fan. other genres are not so fortunate. however  many of the  old-school  games hold up incredibly well and I still play them because they re better than the new stuff. there are also some remakes that maintain the best of their origins  including  age of empires 2  definitive edition.
@ltnetjak until they say modern audience in one announcement and you people lose your damn minds
Imean there are games out there who try to appeal to an old school audience  doom 2016 eternal comes to mind   but unfortunately they are few and far between.
and in movies and just about every other entertainment media
@ifstatement ifstatement  amen
scary but without the thrill of any of the horror...
@chandler burse  and when I get my company up and running I will not be a ceo that will be a douchebag to his employers because I grew up playing video games since the 90s and since then Ive had a passion for playing video game and Ive heard stories about how ceos these days are treating their employees like trash and they re getting underpaid and thats not good the passion for modern making in video games is gone I plan on bringing some of that back I plan on recruiting people who love making video games and who have a passion for it thats the plan I also will be bringing back the beat em up genre but how are we go about it making a beating up genre in a modern setting well the imagination is all there I will be making first person shooters rpgs you name it but if Im going to do this Im going to first need wonderful members of a board that I cantrust
@michael coulter  I feel like nearly every ceo today has said this when they were younger. business unfortunately is more complex than one can dream and being successful changes people and the gaming industry in its most successful forms such as in japan is horrible to its employees its toxic conditions. bad work hours but thats how working well done games come out. perfectionists like rockstar also do this.the only company I know that doesnt do crunch which is the worst part of game development is insomniac but they are either okay or woke depending on who you ask.
@michael coulter  I wanted to be a game dev but I lost all interest on the work conditions and the fact I am genuinely uncompetitive and the math required for computer science is well failable at best for me.I lost a lot of passion for a lot of things.and genuinely I remember a game dev telling me that  you dont get into game development because you love to play games you get into because you love to make them that might be useful to you.
@chandler burse  well thats why in my company Im not bringing any woke people in there I dont care how much they want and complain Im not doing it because when I woke people get inside anything it turns to s    and so many businesses and the gaming industry will probably have to file bankruptcy because of the ignorance of the world mob thats why Im not doing it at my company I want normal thinking people in my company I want people who have a passion for making games in my company and thats the key word passion it is word that has been lost in the gaming industry but I plan on resurrecting the passion bringing in people in from all over the united states as well as internationally my goal and my company will be to make the big gaming corporations like ea and activision reevaluate how they treat their employees because if my company Im not having that I will treat my employees with fairness I will treat my employees with compassion and at my gaming company you will not be making  44 an hour instead you ll be making 55 dollars an hour you will be getting paid for time off you will be getting paid for sick leave you will receive dental benefits you will get paid vacation time off and all the good things that come with working in my future company and you will receive medical benefits that will be nothing but the best for my future employees and also I plan on making a place in which employees will be able to spend nights sort of like a hotel area and I will also provide daycare and various other things from my employees because game design takes months and years to develop a good video game just look at how many years and months it took rockstar to develop red dead redemption it took them a long time so if my employees are married and I have children I would like to build a separate area from the main studio for them and their family sort of like a hotel situation
@chandler burse  yeah I wanted to do that too till I find out that the game designers aren t making a lot and thats why Im looking to pursue a career and entrepreneurship and start my own gaming company I believe in the old if you build it they will come motto and thats not just a line from a movie thats a line thatsticks with you but Im looking to go big with this company Im looking to go elon musk big thats how big Im looking to go and it will be a fair company to all employees of all the colors of the rainbow and it will not be based in california or new york instead it will be based in texas
@michael coulter  you hire based on politics thats discrimination.it may backfire on you.and the executives are the ones who approve of this stuff youre blaming devs and writers but the only reason wokeness are in games is because capitalist execs see potential profit in targeting all audiences as much as possible.
@michael coulter  I feel like your comments sound like a teenager dreaming of his dream job being a generous rich man.then you end up flipping burgers.dude be a realist
@michael coulter  most employees would probably just move to the where the company is based
@chandler burse  I wouldn t say I hire based on politics Im hiring based on common sense think about itsince big gaming corporations like ea and activision have allowed the woke to come in there and destroy everything they worked for what has happened to ea and activision as well as many other gaming corporations they have had to cave and they have had to bow to the woke mob I dont want that for my corporation I want people with common sense thats what I want and I want people that love video games rather than people that pretend they love video games and they dont love video games at all thats what Im looking to do
@michael coulter  ea and activison have destroyed their games for years before wokeness
@michael coulter  in order to weed out wokeness you would have to hire based on beliefs and politics again discrimination could bite you in the arse
not so much scary as it is the most ridiculous eye roll a fan of thatseries or franchise can make
@as above so below  I will I will count you in
the actual interview article says   we are applying adjustments to certain areas where things need modernizing due to the passage of time. take that as you will but it doesnt say  for a modern audience .
truer words have never been spoken
@toxic toucan  anti-sjws hear the word  modern  and lose their minds nowadays
@michael coulter  idk about activision  but ea has certainly bowed to the post modern diatribe  every single battlefield since 1 has being a wreck and they even somehow manage to make a game about magic powered space ninjas and epic scifI battles  shit
@josh jonson  yep youre right
simple just buy the pc version of silent hill 2 and mode it with unreal engine 5 and you good to go.
playing half life  quake 2  and system shock 2 rn
I have a 50 plus year old cousin  now  that was afraid of playing doom 3 when it came out  he never admitted it but the reason he gave was that it was  too dark . he liked all sorts of shooters but not that one  the one that had the best graphics when it came out. I guess the npc meme isnt really a meme. casuals are dooming creativity.
enemies  will not bleed anymore
Im on it... just hang on
things like this is why I hate the word modern.
@ltnetjak  ...for now.
fromsoft  the makers of dark souls  bloodborne  and most recently elden ring  has that covered.unfortunately they are among the few that want to make a fair experience that is true to its category of gaming.
@mrconredsx  kojima brainwashed  lol. the man would be doing the brainwashing himself. and what games are woke  most people including you probably love nearly all his games
@mrconredsx  kojima is still very pro artistic his politics he chooses are also very japanese since he s anti-nuke
@mrconredsx  I dont really care you people freak out at the sign of a black character which isnt what I use to stand for when it came to disliking woke things
@chandler burse  then enjoy trans characters and 50 pronounces in new death stranding. if you cant gatekeep this genre  then stop whining about other woke crap or  adjusting to modern audience  you are just another normie in transition brainwashed by mainstream modern gaming.
I like signalis a good survival horror game
agreed people are just too.... I dont know we need this but better and scary as f man
they would just call that retro... and call that any tittle with low graphics
I dont want games for any  audience I want games for gamers its supposed to be a game  not an interactive  choose your own ending  movie
@ltnetjak  yeah monster hunter and most fighting games got our backs to.
yes
I actually want a game that challenges me and does hold my hand.

lol
same
never expected much from this remake to begin with. I ll stick with the og.
sucks for you. Im still gonna enjoy it.
@emil carter  let s hope so.
@dont worry about it   I guarantee you they re probably going to improve the scary ness since the original was never scary  just creepy and uncomfortable. the storytelling and presentation are also bound to be better since its not as limited as a ps2 game. made for a modern audience doesnt always mean making it worse it literally just means its a revamp to make it as effective today for new gamers as it was back then. y all just love to hate anything new
@emilcarter3913  we dont hate everything new. I am actually very looking forward to this game  but  made for modern audiences  is a red flag for a reason. many people today are soft and companies do love bowing down to squishy masses. especially in america.Imay change my mind because  as of right now  this is all speculation and we wont really know how the game turns out until it arrives. so if they stay true to the horror element or make it even stronger then you bet your a   I ll be on it in a heartbeat. but for now Im keeping my expectations low.
@daunt  exactly
no  we live in the best timeline. we ll just have to suffer to get there. God s plan.
@darok the heavy - the maul  thats the spirit
@manco65 I grew up during the golden age of video games arcades  atarI into nes days lol  my grandfolks have passed back in the 90s so unlikely in my case haha.
yep  we thought were people
Im going to go to the delorean  go back in time  and find out what went wrong.  cue the music
I think unreal engine 5 is offering a lot of potential for the industry. suddenly  indie devs will be capable of making products that had previously been exclusive to aaa companies. there could very possibly be a lot of true gamers who will be making actual games because they re fed up with the copy-and-paste interactive movies and walking simulators that have flooded the market.
@darok the heavy - the maul always gotta get a religious comment here.even as a Christian I am starting to find these irritating people have bigger questions which need better answers sometimes
@blox117 sounds like an incel comment lol
@darkside gamer kill everyone go back to the first human ape ancestor and just kill it there fixed all issues lol
@jay sullivan uh didnt indie devs have access to unreal engine 4 too  what about 5 will suddenly make their products just as good as aaas  and by the way most big devs started as indie so when indie start popping out higher quality games they will often likely go down the same rabbit hole of becoming a big company.all these devs you people hate remember use to be smaller more beloved teams.people here hate naughty dog like the devs had sex with their spouses or something. but yet they use to make jak and daxter and uncharted.
@blox117  what  that word seems like its used for people who spread their religion  how am I one
@chandler burse  cause you threw around a meaningless word to insult me
@chandler burse  same here  just calling it like I see it. truth hurts
@blox117  glad you agree. edgy atheist from the internet back alleys
@chandler burse    ue5 does a lot of ai-generated stuff. facial animations  body animations  automatic lod changes  bounce lighting  etc. are all things that required manual work in ue4. now  devs can allow the engine to do a lot of that work  freeing them to do other things and giving them a higher-quality product. it doesnt matter much if the devs make a good game  or a few  and then change into one of these corrupt companies  as there will be new devs to replace them. its not as if only so many devs are given access to ue5.no  not all of these devs used to be loved. most of them have never worked on a good game. you clearly dont know what s going on in the industry. if that were the case  it would be irrelevant anyhow. the point is that far more people are now capable of making good games  a large company isn t required for getting a quality that was previously exclusive to them.
@jay sullivan  aI generated is a infant thing tho its not perfect.
@jay sullivan  a lot of them use to be loved what most companies do you complain about here  naughty dog  ea even was loved  people here have fond memories of activisions older cods.microsoft definitely. capcom 100  most of the devs people hate for wokeness use to be loved.oh and definitely konamI which is a main topic here
@jay sullivan  my point is most of the big companies you hate for wokeness are old and use to be loved.some are newer devs sure but people are complaining mostly about the likes of konamI  square enix and santa monica and nd.
@jay sullivan  we either get hope givers like you or destitutes who say gaming is dead and the world is ending  which it probably is soon if the oil predictions are correct  so I dont know what to think I lose empathy on these conversations I feel less hopeful I just want people to shut up.
na  same timeline. just twisted by the actions of some weirdos.
@chandler burse    I am saying that most of the passionate devs have moved on. those that haven t are outnumbered by new and younger devs in their company. the people who made the games I love aren t still working at the companies they started. those companies are now run by different people who are more concerned about money and pushing  social justice  than they are about making good games and rewarding loyal customers.
if timelines were a thing I d say the best timeline is the one where the planes missed the towers
@highbudget  the best timeline would be where nothing bad happened.why start it at 9 11  or is it just good for the us
@mad dog gamer  the dude literally said  we treated women like people  in reference to ops what else does itsound like  give me a better reason as to not refer to his tasteless comment as anything else lol.
@chandler burse  it is best to ignore the trolls  man. it ain t worth it.
@mad dog gamer  then why you come calling me a wank and such  and I am mostly irritating people myself here so I guess I could be considered a troll.
@chandler burse  incel is a heavily overused term as of late. I complained about the dead space remake making the women ugly for no reason while also turning isaac clarke into adam sandler. some individuals called me an incel because I dared to complain about western developers creating some ugly looking mofos in every single game they release. its incredibly tiresome. Im old enough to remember when videogame developers used to care about masculinity in males and feminine beauty in females. now  every character looks incredibly generic  androgenous and do not stand out in any way. if you want the perfect example of what Im talking about  look at tlou2. every character there is a complete eyesore for the sake of  realism  while also catering to this elusive and totally real  modern audience .
@chandler burse  meanwhile  look at japanese developers. they still embrace masculinity and femininity  as itshould be  and their characters stand out immensely as a result. for example  even after their makeovers  the re characters resembled their original counterparts in the remakes and re8 in the case of chris.
@chandler burse  because every time I scroll through the comments  I always find someone saying incel for no reason. but I admit it was uncalled for  and I apologize.
@mad dog gamer I apologize too I am being quite petty and too confrontational.I kind of just gave up on being civil on the internet anymore at least when it comes to certain topics.
@mad dog gamer isaac clarke always looked like that. he doesnt look like sandler to me.and nicole is aged up because thats how she was in dead space 2 although I admit it looks like they screwed up a bit there.
@mad dog gamer people do complain about the remake designs though. some claim ada isnt asian enough that claire shouldnt be wearing pants but shorts.others go on about how jills face looking manly.
@mad dog gamer I just dont get why gamers are now picky about real looking characters there have been real looking people in games forever and woke media today has caused a bias distortion in both sjws and anti-sjws they both see problems in nearly everything today itseems.
@highbudget    the bombs would have still gone off.
@chandler burse    I hope you got your jabs and all of the boosters  as the government would never lie to you.
@chandler burse    dont worry  you dont need to believe me about 9 11. the only thing I ask of you is to make certain that you get your booster shots. thats what s best for the community.
too much action in this action game
@solid snake  too much freedom in rpg is reality now...
the original ending was not hard at all  so this news really bothers me
very skeptical about this game considering bloober has never done combat in any of their games  they could easily just turn it into a walking sim somehow lol
there will be a golden line that points you to every objective and puzzle piece  the fights will be replaced by quick-time events  and you will be able to see enemies through walls.
@jay sullivan  bloober team is not that competent to make gps and see-through walls for enemies. its gonna be a walking simulator with easy puzzles  no combat  and a story thatsays that if youre depressed  youre making everyone around you feel bad  and therefore unaliving yourself is the only solution.
honestly its not a difficult game bu any means  I just dont think they re going to be able to recapture the magic is the thing
like they did to gow ragnarok.
yeah  it ll just consist of being a puzzle game thats a walking simulator  with some action elements. so removing the main core of what made the game successful in the first place  is a good idea  are we gonna be at a point where we re gonna remove horror altogether in entertainment
youre not kidding  I grew up with the atarI 2600 and nintendo and all those other games and consoles where they didn t give you even instructions. and I learned to play on that. the hardest games in this generation  Ive tried several of them  and they were so easy. even dark souls  which is widely touted as one of the hardest games  was ridiculously easy.
I used to die hundreds  or thousands of times in games  before I beat them. but now  even the  hard games  on their hardest difficulties  if I die more than 5-10 times  Im shocked.  and once I learn the mechanics and timings  deaths become very rare. most games I dont get a game over  at all.
@recneps  yeah  silent hill 2 isn t known for being a difficult game. but I could see newer audiences getting lost and confused on where to go  not so much them struggling with the combat. but thats half the fun of the silent hill games. exploring disturbing worlds and trying to navigate through them successfully. it d be a shame if they made that far too easy.
@red man  the original game had difficulty levels for both the combat and riddles ranging from easy to hard. and it had a setting you can enable that allows you to pick up 1x 2x or 3x ammo pickups. so if anything is getting updated is maybe no tank controls  the cumbersome uI for doing some puzzles and how fluid combat quick switch weapons  is and maybe some of the boss fights actually have more then just running to one end of the room  shooting  dodge and running to the other end of the room.
@anti-bs  but sh2 actually was a walking sim with primitive two-button action. see no issue here
Im jelly.
ps2 or xbox version
nice pick up!!
nice. around 2014  I saw a random ps2 game at a thrift store  mana khemia 2. never heard of it. but it was only a few bucks  came in good condition with all manuals and a bonus ost disc. turns out its a collectors item I ebay d it for over  100.
you got the booklet too ! thats like finding a dinosaur
games abandonware theres basically no way to play it without a ps2 or enduring the remastered version that is broken.or getting it modded on pcand as someone without a pc or able to afford one and not gonna spend money on a ps2 either I have little options
@chandler burse  emulate it. I olayed emulated ps2 games on my pc all the time.
@whatahorriblenight  he says he doesnt own a pc which just blows my mind.
@whatahorriblenight  I dont have a pc
you can also get the best version  enhanced edition  for free if you have a pc  p I own that and 2 ps2 copies  one of which is the sh collection of the first four games.
nice. I still have all my copies of all the silent hill games  even sh1 on the ps1. Ive even got the xbox version of sh2 that comes with the maria side game.
I bought silent hill2 and 3 on ebay on mint condition 2 years ago and I was so happy I could play them as they originally where before any  fixing  could be done.
@blumiu  no doubt. I bought the greatest hits ps2 version way back in the era of the ps2 for  20. its in perfect mint condition and I d never in my life even think about selling it. its one of my favourite games of all time with ffviI and shadow of the colossus.
@wimpher  to find a game like that in perfect condition has to be one of the rarest things out there.
alas  we cannot help but hope that the inevitable does not come to be
your mistake was thinking bloober team was any good. they warned us how bad they are at making horror games with layers of fear  pt rip off   blaire witch project   depressed  good  unalive yourself   and the medium   sister is depressed and unleashed a monster  good  unalive her or yourself  . your second mistake was forgetting konamI threw everything away to focus on pachinko machines.capcom proved that they can reimagine an old classic and make it a lot better than the original  with re2   they also proved that they can still screw it up badly  with re3 . konamI really just has no leg to stand on at all.
hype is natural
@roman arriaga everything is a pt ripoff because its fps lol.also layers of fear wasnt that bad maybe not scary but it was kind of emotional.
@roman arriaga h dude people hate capcom too for remaking the games in a newer style rather than the old.but seriously pt  first of all that isnt a real game it wasnt even said to represent shs properly at all its a walking fps simulator and so therefore every other fps walking game with some spooks is a copy of it people overblow that demo waaaaay too much these days when the actual game wouldve been the real prize.and besides kojima never made silent hill before the game could ve honestly sucked but people wont admit that. he was metal gear solid s creator before shs.
guess you never knew how japan is with censorship
yeah I kind of got my hopes up that I d finally get to play it having missed out on it before. but this is really crushing to hear now...
@chandler burse  idk about that. I Imean every normal human being likes seeing hot people. but yea if they re seething over a cover up thats stupid. unless she didn t have a defined beautiful figure as she should. thats different. but yea all iconic beloved characters in fiction are good looking people. for good reason. its what we all aspire to and like. we dont want to see some fat slob as superman.
ah yes. the classic  git gud  mantra. you gotta love it.
I still havent touched any of fromsoftware games.
if only getting better was enough
@chandler burse  riveting story  lad!
@voyager  almost as riveting as every other reply here indeed
@mr mxyzptlk  we all aspire to be japanese hot women  lol wow.you guys dont even care about how men look in games you know that  maybe not you but the dudes crying about tifa never say crap about the male protags. same for when melonies audience talked about nicoles face in the dead space remake but no one cared that isaac looks like elijah wood lol.
@mr mxyzptlk  theres nothing wrong with real looking people in games that want to be realistic and melonies audience seems like the type that fear aging.strange for melonie if true since Christians should learn to accept a woman who ages or lest they be stuck in that issue of porn which exploits mens attractions towards younger ageless women.
@chandler burse  we all aspire to be good looking  thought that was clear  yikes dude.
@chandler burse  also trust me we care about the guys too. heck pattinson originally was bullied because people thought he was too soft and weak to play batman. thankfully he nailed it as batman. so yea idk what youre talking about. we care on both fronts.
@mr mxyzptlk  I aspire to find meaning in life again I am already exercising and it hasnt made me happier I just do it to feel a bit better and less unhealthy.
@chandler burse  uh what  hot people are real people  you mean the average looking joe or jill  sure  no one cares to see that guy or girl tho. its just facts. denial and delusion wont change that. people like hot people.
@chandler burse  ok well thats you  youre not most people at all. most like hot people and wish they were hot as well. idk what planet you come from to think otherwise. you can be accepting and proud for who you are. but dont delude yourself into thinking you wouldn t wanna be hot.
@mr mxyzptlk  what  pattinson isnt ugly no one cared about how handsome he looked.most of melonies audience focuses on women being redesigned they couldnt care less about men. they demand women look like japanese anime super models like tifa but they dont care if isaac clarke isnt super muscular or ripped like doom guy or God forbid duke nukem
@chandler burse  wow almost like you missed my point. they wanted him to be big enough. obviously if they cast some ugly looking freak. no one would want thats as batman.
@mr mxyzptlk  people thought pattinson was bad because he played edward cullen people who couldnt get their heads out of 2008.
@chandler burse  that and his size.
@chandler burse  but yea thankfully after batman  his reputation saved from twilight
@mr mxyzptlk  his reputation was saved before batman he s done well it was idiots stuck in 2008.also keaton was fucking batman and he is smaller than pattinson
@chandler burse  bro I didn t say you had to make a goal. any normal person with a brain in their head wants to be hot. end of story
@chandler burse  no  youre plain wrong  some average looking chick isn t hot. kate upton  katy perry  scarlett johansson are hot. these women have beautiful figures and big boobs. its not a fantasy whatsoever. girls with thin waists and big boobs exists. there s tons of different shaped natural beautiful women out there. you have more curvy kate upton  then a slimmer but still beautiful ana de armas and gal gadot. so yea calling it fantasy is laughable. you ve been talking to too many anime pfps to where youre just as much in fantasy as they are.
@chandler burse  true but no one watched lighthouse. everyone watched batman. the batman was phenomenal btw. cant wait for the sequel
@mr mxyzptlk  katy perry has like a million doppelgangers
@mr mxyzptlk  big boobs are a preference not an objective beauty standard we just made it that way.especially due to porn
@mr mxyzptlk  I never said natural big boobs dont exist dont make baseless claims
@mr mxyzptlk  a lot of people watched lighthouse lolthats a joke right  theres entire video essays praising the movie floating around lol.do you think only superhero movies get a lot of watchers  by that logic there will be blood had no one watching it back in 2007 because everyone was too busy waiting for the dark knight
@mr mxyzptlk  emma stone is hot cmon thats just real denial there.natural women who arent the curviest or well endrowed in the chest are hot too. or at least can be.ironic here too since melonie is a skinny less curvy woman herself who is nearly flat chested.but half the comments are like creepily flirtatious with her.
@chandler burse  ok
@chandler burse  no they didn t  did you see the box office  its non existent in comparison. again your points are so out of left field or just dont contest what Im saying
@chandler burse  yea melonie is thin  and she s not hot. she s pretty sure  maybe a 7  possible 8 if Im generous for a thin chick. but she s not megan fox or anything by any stretch of the imagination.
@mr mxyzptlk   nah Im aware.
@roman arriaga  thats a good point.
@chandler burse  pt is not an fps.
@ladypepperkat  its a taste not an objective flaw.people actually liked layers of fear 1 in terms of story.I dont get why people act like its super hated.
@ladypepperkat  also didnt kojima make a walking simulator across america lol
@roman arriaga  hard disagree on the re2 remake  but I thoroughly enjoyed it
and having alternative outfits   la fortnite
its right behind me  isn t it
and charge you for save slots!
there already is a minimap in the original game... its my favorite game of all time so I d be the first to get angry if they ruin it but the game is not even out yet  people need to stop complaining about stuff that they dont know about lol.
@ifstatement ifstatement  we ll be seeing pyramid head doing stupid dances for braindead gen z audiences.
Im in a misty town and Im seeing...freakin  demons! !
same. I ll give my money to capcom for re4r  because that actually looks good
@antnj81  I feel the same way  both sh2 and re4 are in list of favorite video games of all time. and I just know blooper team is going to strip away all the aspects  that made the original so fun and memorable.
yeah I got the same impression having played the original second game for the first time a few months ago. not scary but creepy.
sh2 fan remaster thats constantly in development is the best way to play the game but its only on pc
capcom failed pretty hard on the faithful to the source material with 3 remake  but seems they learned for the 4 remake
@wolfpack  its cus the team that worked on 3 remake isn t the same for 2 or 4  the team for 2 remake is working on 4
also they made both re 2 and 3 remake at the same time. they didn t allow themselves to learn from re 2 remake to how to make 3 better. still love both games though  so they ve  capcom  earned my trust when it comes to preorders.
the trailer has cutscenes from different points in the story  which are carbon copies from the original game. I wont spoil but the person kicking the keys away from james and james falling to his knees are both cutscenes from the original game so Im 99  confident the story will remain almost exactly the same.
@dragonaut111  yeah I hope so  but even then james now has a grizzled voice  and he s also increbibly more emotional in some of the other cutscenes. kinda removes some of the original s subtlety
@sincerelynotme  oh  thats a good point. I never thought about it like that. they didn t know how the re2 remake would turn out  so they couldn t learn from it when developing the 3 remake.
@blue flare  exactly  re3 remake was more like the residual or the leftovers from re2 remake. they realized they had enough for another game and thus re3 remake was realized.
thats putting it lightly. all the western-made ones are fanfiction with the silent hill name slapped on
@jean bethencourt  thats the most accurate description of those Ive heard
really just depends on the dev  not the race
@anti-bs  sadly  the race culture are hugely important for this type of horror
except konamI wanted this
@gloria thomas  Imean  at the end of the day konamI is their own worst enemy. they really haven t made anything worthwhile in house since about 2015. while I have no proof  my biggest fear is that they are trying to capitalize on the success of resident evil 2 and final fantasy viI remakes  both of which where made in house by their developers  but instead of doing the work themselves  are just outsourcing it
@jean bethencourt  of any story telling I think  after all your environment affects your outlook.
@jean bethencourt  race and culture what  that isnt in the remake so far all the characters in the trailer seem white as they were before
@andrew latourette  totally agree.
@chandler burse  they are copying a japanese product. that doesnt mean japanese devs cant make white characters  usually better than white people can .
when western developer tried to remake devil may cry it went bad... really bad. not gameplay per say... but can you seriously take story where you defite demon Lord by stopping his fabric of demonic soda  beating his demonic newscaster and fitting and killing his unborn child  yes  I dont make it .
@abcz zc  haha! totally agree!
remakes are nothing anyone should ever be excited for  why remake something that was already good  if it aint broke dont fix it
there was a short period of time when an update like this really meant a remaster  just freshen up the graphics  maybe update the engine to be smoother and more responsive  make sure it runs in windows 7  instead of crashing on anything newer than xp. no changes to core gameplay or story. now they just want the automatic sales that come from the game license name nostalgia while not using any of what made the franchise great in the first place.
@anti-bs  sometimes remakes tend to be better than the original since they add more content to the game and even fix some issues the original one had.that being said  silent hill 2 didn t need a remake. sure  the controls are extremely dated  but the graphics still hold up for a game released in the early 2000s. also  I doubt the audience of today will understand what made it great it in the first place  they all need to be  spoonfeed  facts  and silent hill is the exact opposite of something that throws you facts at your face.
remakes are too trendy now anyways I really hope capcom stops for awhile after 4
@anti-bs remaking bad things doesnt sell to producers because if it was bad in the first place then theres no potential profit in it
@lorenzo romano eople can understand complex stories its irritating when older people act like their childrens generation cant even read a damn book.and yet they cant even use a damn laptop half the time lol
@chandler burse  Imean  you cant even write  people  for starters...
@lorenzo romano  its called texting fast you cant always get a word right.but thanks for using a low blow. maybe try another
@lorenzo romano  peoplepeoplepeoplepeoplethere happy lol.
@chandler burse   low blow   Im not the one here saying that old people dont know how to use an old laptop here  y know.karen much
combat in a horror game is a tricky thing  they cant be too good or the scares aren t as effective  but they cant be too clunky either or players will not have fun. it needs that balance so that you feel competent enough to engage  but not so competent that you curve stomp the scares.
the scariest part of silent hill 2 was how disturbing it could be  the angela room gave me such disgust when I picked up on it  and the game purposefully makes it extremely disturbing because of its themes
the music direction alone is already a departure of what made sh game a sh game  even if yamaoka is involved in some way  he also stated the  modern audiences  crap. even not sold on the siren blood curse thats confusing itself as silent hill f.
I just want them to mesh all the woke items into one movie.  it will be the best unintentional comedy ever
games going mainstream as a whole was the worst thing to ever happen to them
I hope it comes to psvr2.  devs working with itsays what they are doing with it is absolutely terrifying.  as you might know psvr2 tracks your eye for performance by giving you high quality only where you are looking which also means it knows when you blink.  it will cue events when you blink.
it gets worse everyone. I heard from a credible source that they re even considering changing the name of it from silent hill to rather noisy incline or loud protuberance. and when it gets misty the monsters stop to give you directions to the nearest safe zone stocked with a save point and an ampoule. and apparently pyramid head now goes by they them or person s with a perpendicular triangle disability.
no way canthey do this to silent hill ! the beauty of silent hill is how terrifying the world is what s happening to the world lol  love your video hun
as a silent hill fan Im now deeply concerned
everyone a moment of silent for silent hill remake. its good   amazing while it lasted before 2022-2023.
they should release both  the  scary  version   the  cute  version
great take. youre right on target. most of the time when they refer to a  modern   contemporary  audience   they re referring to an audience that doesnt exist. when I think of remakes that are actually faithful  I think of the 2002 re1 remake  as you mentioned in the video  and house of the dead remake  a must play if you haven t played it and if you like rail shooter games. both are incredibly faithful to the originals and hardly change but a few things. truly a disappointment with silent hill 2 remake but I guess us gamers will have to wait for more info.
part two was scary for me so was 3 and 4  these new kids these days wont get that true experience we did almost 20 years ago I love killing demons in games
melanie I have a question. what happens after they destroyed every classic game that built the industry they are in  I asked the same question on friday night tights about tv shows. do we get new original greatness or not after everything s wrecked
they re probably going to change the  abstract daddy  boss since it would be considered triggering due to the context when it comes to angela. that or they ll edit her dialogue. maria will also have pants.
I expected this... doesnt make it any less sad.
literally the only game I ever bought multiple times and played thoroughly. now it looks like the only horror remaining in this remake  and others  is the creeping destruction of all I once loved.
yeah! you said it melonie! studios  make new stories and franchises! same goes with movies! make new stuff for modern audiences and if they wanna remake the legendary franchises  create it balanced for the fanbase and contemporary people. I know youre a tr fan as I am is to agent 47. and by far  hitman is the only videogame  thatstayed true to its fanbase while garnering a huge following from new audiences. why cant other studios do what ioI did
ack! thats super depressing to hear. Ive been wanting to try that game but its really hard to get the original version on ps2  I think  . this would ve been an easier way to try out this game but I guess I wont be playing it this way then.
sometimes I think the world portrayed in demolition man from 1993 isn t really so far from right now. and it was supposed to take much longer!
@lorenzo romano  you started it with people today not able to understand complexity in stories when thats exactly what people today want.its just media outlets that make itseem this way and how companies treat players like idiots not like they need it that way.
@chandler burse  well youreally aren t making a good case for yourself. besides  I didn t  start  anything  you called me out for  using low blows  when you yourself also used one.this entire conversation is insane.
@lorenzo romano  an insane convo is more fun than an echochamber so.
@lorenzo romano  I guess I just want to piss people off here I use to just argue points but ive lost empathy and hope in many ways dealing with sjws and antisjws on melonies and sydney watsons and kavernacle so its more fun to just point out holes and express my emotional distress and then people just dont really care.and then someone says I need a therapist when I already talked to one a Christian one and I dont know if it did crap for me.just let me have this I guess I ll hopefully burn out and maybe move on when my life actually gets going.
@chandler burse  exactly. remakes arent inherently a bad thing. just that they are far too overdone and lazy these days and are only made for a quick buck with minimal effort. then once and a while a good remake comes up  crash n sane trilogy and spyro reignited trilogy for example were great. but the large majority of them are nothing compared to the originals.
they need to take some notes from resident evil 7.
yeap. the horror genre is a lot like comedy in that balance and timing are key and thats very hard to get right for a large amount of people. Im surprised at what gamers find scary when it doesnt scare me at all because Ive played so many horror games at this point that Im desensitised. Im more focused on the mechanics of the game rather than content per se.
actually it can be good. it just cant be like all badass high kicks or dark souls rolling on ground to evade attacks.
to be fair the combat is the least appealing part of the original games  beating sh2 on hard 10 star is just tedium incarnate lol
lol damn thats crazy. the potential for jumps scares lol
@ifstatement ifstatement  yeah and no one else will be sharing thatsweaty head gear.
sounds neat
eventually market will reset. pissed fans make great devs.
the modern versions become the true and only versions for future generations  and all traces of the originals will be erased from history long after everyone who s reading this text has passed away.
considering some companies wont even touch good classics for some reason this likely wont happen.for one nd refuses to go back to the jak and daxter series for better or worse and has picked last of us over it a few times in fact jak 4 was considered before they settled on tlou1
they ll destroy them again. further.
oh man  you might be completely right on this...
yeah I am worried about that and the stair case scene with ph I really hope they dont hold back because they had a huge purpose and they need to hit the player hard.
considering the trailer clearly shows the mannequin rape scene is still in I doubt they would remove abstract daddy if they didnt remove the mannequin.
you have a pc or laptop  silent hill 2 is abandonware on pc so you can download it for free and then a modders made a  enhanced edition  patch that fixes all the problems with the pc port and adds some modern features like ultrawide. its the best way to play the game.
@ooooswain  I try not to pirate things  but if it truly is abandonware thatsounds great!
only reason Im not totally writing this off yet is its bloober team  which made the medium. I played that game and it has some weird and sick images and themes. Im not optimistic but I want to see the final product before going too crazy.
anytime they say something such as  changed for a modern audience   they need to give an example of a change. the static cameras were a huge part of the game s atmosphere  as far as Im aware. I haven t owned any of the games  so  I dont really know if there are  scary  things thatshould be changed. it might be that certain things wont be scary at all unless they are changed.
ah  the  modern audience  stuff again. never been big in to horror games  I did play the og silent hill games though. oh well.have a great time on @ninainfinity stream today!
I had a strong feeling in first trailer  that they where gonna hold our hand through the game. especially Im game descriptions sounds like its treating us like babies.
capcom noticed that many people bought resident evil 7  but not many new players managed to go past the tutorial because of how scary and graphic it was for them. a player that is not able to finish a videogame is less likely to buy dlcs and sequels. of course other aaa developers have been taking notes.
for a modern audience  code words for  abandon ship
so I think this might be being blown out of proportion  part of me wonders if it just means in terms of combat being refined or obtuse puzzles  like clicking everywhere on a wall till you find a weak point  might just be refined. I could be wrong but I have my fingers crossed.  screenshots show the nurse outfits looking very close
its silent hill now but just wait for resident evil  dead space  the evil within  dead by daylight and many others to be updated for modern audiences.
youre becoming one of my favorite youtubers
yes as a silent hill fan for many years when I saw the trailer I dreaded those 5 words  updated for modern day audience  which I saw in the reveal. at least silent hill f looks promising.
in most horror games I am numb as a player  I barely got scared  the only games that hit my brain were alien isolation and alien vs predator game    silent hill  dont remember which one because its been a long time since I played that.
one thing I have about the industry now that its becoming more and more mainstream is that its all about profits less about creativity. you cant cater to people and make everyone happy. so they just need to make stuff be creative and hope that people actually enjoy it.
love your content and your point of view  keep up the awesome work
you should play the original games  melonie! do like a lets play series of the first 4 games! you ll love them
lol not gonna lie  you made pyramid head adorable in that thumbnaI  melonie uwu
resident evil 7 was probably my favorite new-ish game Ive played in years. I loved itso much. and this is coming from someone who used to hyperventilate when playing old-school resident evils  silent hills  and fatal frames. the scare factor is amazing. village felt like a completely different genre and it took me way longer to get through it  not because it was too hard  but because I would get bored.
when a game is remade  I just want what they call quality of life improvements.maybe there was a long ass cutscene that couldn t be skipped before a hardass boss battle in the older version of a game. in the new version  I want to be able to skip the cutscene after dying a million times and get into it.
good to know getting emulation for old games working is going to be useful...
resident evil 2 remake is the only blueprint you need to follow when it comes to remaking these games
I think they mean that they needed to adjust the scares because a lot of them dont work as they are now without the fixed camera angles.
I feel like a lot of those people are either a. casual af fake gamers the type where their most played game is fortnite or some mobile game that just play for a few minutes to see what the hype is about  b. just really dumb people that dont pay attention to anything and instead blame the game for being  too hard   or c. people were too scared to play but at the same time why the hell did they buy it in the first place if they were gonna be so scared lol
imagine not going beyond the tutorial and call urself a gamer lol
tbf Im not sure if its the difficulty thats the problem in re7. I can imagine for alot of people its the extreme nature of the violence and gore in the opening. when mia first goes into her mold form and chops off ethan s hands with a chainsaw after stabbing a screw driver through his hand is pretty rough for some. and if it did turn people off the game then it is a bit of a shame as that is the only gory part in the whole game.
@darkLord1061  yes  I was talking about the scare factor.
@son goku successful games dont get successful off fat neck beards. its off regular people looking for a fun time. they re trying to grab a larger audience. now I can see both sides  sticking to your  core audience despite less sales. or wanting more sales so toning down the violence. both understandable.
tutorial  what  how difficult is it  its not even remotely hard to get past the guest house
@mr mxyzptlk  yes people complain about why companies appeal to larger audiences than just their 40 year old fans from 98but they forget that profit is higher because of larger audiences and this is capitalism.
@mr mxyzptlk  resident evil 8 was more violent than 7 tho
@chandler burse  not nearly as gory
@chandler burse  this is about horror  not difficulty
why bother remaking a horror game then if they think people are scared of playing horror games  they should remake a game that is in a different genre and leave horror games alone. that would make more sense for where they should invest their money.
@chandler burse
yeah but water it down to much and you lose your core. what are you left with no one. it a gamble !
yes I think melanie should have found something else to make a video on. when it comes out and its awesome she will look dumb.
hope youre right
there were no puzzles like that in sh2. sh2 puzzles are master crafted but they ll probably dumb them down like crazy for modern stupid audience.
@ooooswain  I love silent hill but you think the click on a wall 1000 times is a masterful puzzle  its the definition of a brute force puzzle  so is the puzzle within the bug room when your light dies.
@jean bethencourt  you never know  Im trying to just be neutral. I hope its at least good enough to get people to try the original.
seeing as its made by bloober team who have a horrible track record with horror its safe to say they ruined this remake
combat is being changed. and it is removing the dynamic camera
thats the problem . bloober team has never dont really any combat in there games.
they ve already remade resident evil 2 and 3   they re good games! nostalgic but really well executed  apart from the length of 3
yeah not gonna lie  Im worried about the dead space remaster
the re2 3 remakes were good as they remained faithful to the originals while updating the graphics  controls  and camera angles mainly
@wingedlight8415  I agree! they were very well done. I would say resident evil 3 lost some of its essence and environments in its remaking. it would ve been really cool to see them and reinterpret the choices system! but I still think its a solid title.
dead by daylight  thats a little new to get a remake and its a multiplayer game it wont be as affected I bet unless they remove content
resident evil 8 was already toned down because people complained that 7 was too scary.
@john daniel  but you saw them lacking in 3 and there is the drop off point.
@ladypepperkat  3 was not made by the same team that did re2make
@wingedlight8415  eh  not so much with the re3 remake unfortunately. it didn t exactly stay faithful to the original.
@ladypepperkat  they ve confirmed they have another team helping with the combat
thats what I was thinking too.
@toxic toucan  nothing wrong with trying to be neutral. I wish more people had that mindset.
if anything dead by daylight could use a  remake . the game is a mess of glitches and bugs. its spaghettI code. at this point they would have to completely redo it in order to have a well polished game. other than that I dont really see how you can remake an online multiplayer game.
ahh thank you!
8 is more like 4
@chandler burse  it is  but 4 was a lot scarier. at times 8 didn t even feel like horror.
I really like 7 and 8 for different reasons. I like the focus on metroidvania-like design in 8 but also like the outlast inspiration of 7.
man  7  first run in vr stands as one of the most intense gaming experiences Ive ever had. pure gold.
@it wasn t me  ugh  wish I could play it in vr  but I enjoyed the regular gaming version so much already.
@ghostofasiren 4 was the first to remove horror from the game though beyond the regenerator scene the games are kind of both the same in terms of tone and enemies
I liked village. it did unfortunately dial down the horror  but I still feel like it had a good balance overall.
@ghostofasiren  I disagree. the intro to village did an excellent job at building tension  Im specifically talking about the part where youre walking through the snow in the dark  leading up to the village . the dollhouse section was also great at putting the player on edge. I especially like the sound design for this game. the constant rustling of bushes and snapping of twigs makes it feel like youre constantly being watched.
@blue flare  there were parts that felt horror  but then parts that felt more action oriented  like the last section  and the boss fights. especially the boss fight with alcina .
@ghostofasiren  I agree with that. in thatsense it is a lot like resident evil 4  I just dont know if I would say that its scarier. the only true horror-oriented section in re4 are the regenerators.
@blue flare  its been a while since I played 4. I dont remember a lot of it.
honestly silent hills horror comes from the philosophical psychological aspects and is about the main character accepting what he did and his self punishment manifesting in the monsters he encounters I really hope they dont water it down its not really that terrifying its a little disturbing aslong as the atmosphere is there it will be fine the company that is doing it has made some very very good horror games so Im hopeful but silent hills horror comes from the psychological and jungian psychology put into the story
there were so many red flags in thatstatement that Im shocked they didn t announce nfts for the game.
and what s even scarier is thatsome of these stalwarts of courage will land positions that require bravery  such as military or civic service
I still have my original silent hill 2 on both xbox and ps2. I have it in great shape with the booklets and I also have the big game guide I bought back then
hey melonie! less scary  that doesnt make sense. you look great melonie. looking forward to infinite hope.
yeah.... this makes me sad.... I get changing the timing or occasion of certain scares to keep things fresh  but this is just terrible.at least I know to cut this off like a diseased hand. thanks!
same thing with resident evil village.  capcom claimed they saw  feedback  from resident 7 stating that it was too scary.  as a result  re village wasn t scary at all.
its all about the message.unless they re happy they believe no one should be happy. they will never be happy or right so just ignore them. the more attention we give them the more frustrating and dangerous they are to our normal society.
if the modern audiences cant deal with the monsters in sh2 then God knows how they re going to deal with the severely disturbed characters with really messed up back stories.
as a final fantasy viI fan  knowing I will never actually get a remake after this timewarp sequel called  remake trilogy  ends  is heartbreaking.... been there  done that...
here is what to expect from sh2 remakeif you want an early first look at the updated sh 2 remake controls. go take a look at re village 3rd person mode. and a little bit of homecoming. there will be dodge moves  bobbing and weaving. the levels will be changed  narrow rooms corridors will be widened to fit those new movements controls. some areas will be cut to make the game leaner and streamlined  to make it easier for the new players  expect james to talk as you play about where you are supposed to go and do. hope they dont make him say funny things or silly one-liners. itseems far-fetched but they did it in re remakes. I really hope they dont make him swear like a sailor. I hope they hold off on filling the dialogue with swearing. expect glowing items. pick up items and open door prompts. a lot of squeeze throw  crawl under and jump over prompts. quick time events everywhere. checkpoints and quicksaves.  there is a slight chance they going to make pyramid head chase you around blue creek apartment like mr x. thats what they mean by updating the horror for a modern audience. they will try to copy re remakes success. some people even say remake james looks like leon. they are going to do something about maria escorting you. maybe she will have a weapon and fight alongside james. maybe give her commands like ashley. looking at the trailer the monsters dont shake  twist and move oddly  with changes like this  Im guessing most of the original subtlety will be lost. when someone says dont judge  its just a trailer. 9 times out of 10 what we see in the trailer is what we get.
I also have a sneaking suspicion that any sort of change to the established horror element is going to be changed with overused jump scare methods.  silent hill is all about psychological horror.
ever since ff7 remake I became suspicious of any new remakes being announced these days
western developer  studios in 2034   we gonna remake and update the game for tim. we are aiming to exclude everyone else  but not little timmy.
what about older audiences  they deserve representation too.scary games should be scary.
man I just wanna fight my favourite polygonal monster in a small scary room
pretty sure I count as a  modern audience  but bruh keep loyal to the games man
they want to spread it out to the widest audience possible  which means making less scary  but that also means diluting what made the original so great. gaming has become too big and expensive.
@meloniemac did you hear that magfest had a  kotaku journalistic integrity not found  sign and when a kotaku fash journo tweeted about it  they immediately bent and apologized
the term  modern audience  doesnt necessarily mean  woke  it could just mean they re making it less jank for a newer audience  as older games tend to be full of jank  controls  graphics  etc
no that is silent hill 2 s horror the american games that tried and failed to replicate the original teams creatoon is this sure but its not good and itshouldnt be all sh is about.sh2 is really the only original game in the series that dealt with this as sh1 and 3 are more about occultism and sh4 is about isolation and a serial killer.
wasnt scary at all  bullshit that baby scene was one of the scariest of the series re7 in general is less scary than that.
@chandler burse  that baby haunted my fucking dreams for like a week after playing that game. absolutely one of the most horrifying things Ive ever witnessed in my life.
@unclephillawl   toned down  more like they condensed it into one fucking part instead
@chandler burse  for real  that part was terrifying.
what was wrong with the ff7 remake  besides the stupid complaints about tifas tits it looks pretty accurate the original.
@chandler burse  youremember the  arbiters of fate itseem like the writers wanted to used that plot point as a excuse to change parts of the story like the fight  sephiroth at the end plus the made the fates of bigs  wedge  and jessie very vague then the whole  seen  we re zack survives it just seems like to me they wanted to re write ff7 then remake which Im fine with but if youre going to do that go all the way and call it ff7 re write instead of remake
@david p  I thought ff7 was just part 1
@david p  I actually cannot understand your comment at all.I never played 7 but no ones ever explained why its woke or whatever the original always had politics as far I knew.
@chandler burse  well honestly I think a lot of fans just wish squre did put a part 1 on itso they didn t feel miss led
at least thats the feel I get from everything Ive seen on youtube also sorry if my comment confused you Im not very good at explaining stuff
ofc they did
I think they mean they re going to throw in more jump scares. which is an overly done trope in modern horror. sh2 did fine without those. jump scares will just cheapen the horror.
im gonna play the old school silent hill  so heck em
if they wanna do somethin like this add an option where you can have certain  scary  features removed but dont take it away from everyone smh
re 2 remake was the chance to feel that game in beauty graphics - thats how to remakes how to be done
well said melonie. if you cant handle scary games fine  dont play  em but dont water down our classics. some of us still want to play on the edge of our seats
they will release the mature version later guaranteed.
the combat in sh2 was not janky. it was the fact that the dualshock 2 had some dumb and janky features that team silent made the mistake of trying to use in the game.it was very difficult to control james melee attacks because the dualshock 2 had these stupid  pressure sensitive  button features and the attack james made depended on the level of pressure used on the x button  and let s just say the pressure sensors in the controller was far from precise . so you ended up doing weak side to side swings when you tried to make more powerful overhead swings and vice versa a lot.but other than that  the combat worked as intended. and was very intense.
as an old og fan  I am hoping that they are making itscarier for a modern audience cause lets face it  as time has passed some of the older scare elements are not up to par. I am going to be optimistic and hope they do it justice.
imagine....... scary game needs to be more family friendly.
Ive never played silent hill 2  itseems callisto protocol is the last of the traditional horror games.  Im worried about the dead space remake.
I cant wait to play the re-make of leisure suit larry for a modern audience.
and companies wonder why millions of gamers still emulate retro titles.
its bull crap speak!  haha it really is!
I love the resident evil remakes and especially resident evil village
Im just going to save for the director s cut.
its a horror game horror!!!
can I just say  without being called a simp  mel is looking so good these days. hot damn.  and yes I know  I will be called a simp by all lol
this is why games are starting to get way too easy because of these new gamers. thats why I am happy elden ring  returnal  demon souls remake didn t bow down and kept the game scary.
looks like they were referring to a gaming store we had here in the uk called  game   but a lot of them have gone under. but Imight be wrong.
gad I own 3 copies of the original already. if you have a pc  I suggest you go and find a download for the  free  enhanced edition that fans have been keeping alive  and play the game the way its meant to be. remade for modern audiences the door that wakes in darkness  opening into nightmares.
not every company is capcom
aye but tcp was kinda lame  ruined potential right there. I blame its combat  that was just so mid  you can infinitely dodge boss attacks  like what !
@papa goth  thats an odd complaint  but ok
callisto did terribly though also traditional  callisto is a third person shooter horror just like re4 and the remakes which is what they are doing to silent hill 2 remake
@chandler burse  my point is it didn t shy away from horror and gore in order to appeal to  mainstream audiences
@genetic equality  considering the trailer for the sh2 remake still clearly has the sexy nurses and rape scene with the mannequins I dont know ahat they are removing.
@chandler burse  we ll find out when it releases
@genetic equality  not really  if I can just hit left or right  to dodge a boss infinitely its kind of silly. the combat is kind of like ddr if Im being honest  they definitely needed to do something different from the dead space system  but this just wasn t a good system
@genetic equality  I agree Im glad glen kept in the gore  but it wasn t really scary  nor did I ever get thatsense of dread like he built with dead space  back when they were at visceral
@chandler burse  welp hate to burst your bubble  but a recent statement on the sh2 remake is that it will be updated for  modern audiences  so I expect a lot of content to hit the cutting room floor. konamI shouldn t have jerked around kojima  del toro  and reedus. even though p.t. was not representative of silent hills  it probably would have been proper scary
@papa goth  dead space has definitely desensitized everyone  itscared the crap out if my friend when he watched me play it.  body horror is not necessarily scary  and thats not what glen said it was supposed to be  he said it was a horror game.
@papa goth  doesnt mean much if the trailer content is still there.I am not taking confirmation from you or melonie the games content will have to be seen be or said to be cut. updated for modern audience  doesnt mean the trailer of content that was three years in development already will be removed.it could be sure but the video has already said what you said so why would I still be saying this otherwise
@papa goth  del toro wasnt apart of pt was he
@papa goth  pt couldve sucked too for all we know kojima never made a horror game before it.we will never know but people ride that demo way harder than kojima worshippers do in mgs.
@genetic equality  dead space was scary but it wasnt the scariest of games I would say.the body horror was probably something unique for the time though.
@genetic equality  callisto was literally constantly advertised as a from the dead space makers that was part of why it failed because so many people expected it to be a proper successor to ds but it didnt live up to it
@chandler burse  I think dead space 2 nailed the balance between pure horror and body horror  necromorphs being body horror  nicole and the violent hallucinations being horror
@genetic equality  that horror isnt gone at all yet you people are overreacting.gory horror games still exist for better or worse. re8 was still gory for God sakes.
aw shucks  thank you!
she s fine to you thats cool. youre no simp !

the true horror is gonna be the release of this remake and then the reaction...ohh man.. its gonna be bad
melonie you should play death stranding
they re making killer doll movies for people who dont want to see killing  and survival horror games for people who dont want to survive horror.
I just know they re gonna censor a lot of the more intense moments. if they re gonna water down the horror  they re gonna water down the story. at least I know now to not even bother with the remake and just play the original.
they got rid of the over the top gore in the ninja gaiden 1 and 2 remasters as it was aimed for a modern audience
it killed me when I heard that the new fable is getting this treatment
when I play horror game  I want to be a little freaked. that moment in the forest  when you go down your first cave complex  and the only source of light is a bic lighter. in alien isolation when th he alien runs past you  and you dont see it  but all the lights are swinging  and thats the way you have to go....I want that oh shit feeling!
we want a horror game without the horror. we want a game without it being a game. we want a remake but  remake it the way we want.  go play your walking simulators and leave our classics alone. if you want a horror game thats easy  go play on steam where most of those horror games are about jump scares and not so much dying. leave out classic aaa games alone. I will never understand why they cater to this small crowd that doesnt even want to play it. look at what happened with saints row  they didn t even want to play a game they said they wanted.
I really hope this was phrased wrong because otherwise this is dead on arrival or even before. they should be upping the scare factors. watch them remove puzzles too.
halfway through the video and noticed youre reacting a little early to the article. read a little further and you ll notice its lost in translation. as for the gameplay  combat was stiff as hell in the original  so over the shoulder makes sense. if they can include fixed camera over the shoulder combination in part 1 though  that d be great! it wouldn t be silent hill 1 without that alley way scene. xp
they ve just released images of juliet starling for the upcoming remake of lollipop chainsaw.
I bet there is a different edition for the japanese  market. if so I hope they have a language patch for it.
we just cant have good things can we ....
for the past few years  I have been actively seeking out  movies made for your boomer grandpa who used your remote control once and it never worked right again.
this is sad considering it was one of the scariest games Ive played as a kid next to re and dino crisis
it feels like retro is the only way to go if you want games to be just games again.
wow. konamI had a chance to make a major comeback. but they already fucked up.I knew it was too good to be true.
it like- how damn I wanted so bad to get in the natation team but I cant swim - dont worry timmy  we ll get rid of all the water so you dont have to learn anymore - thanks pal  could you do something for me next summer   I was planning to go to the sea
melonie do you ever watch doomcock s videos and have you seen his latest one  if so what are your thoughts on it
this is what made silent hill 2 one of the most talked about games to this day. each monster had a meaning for being there. some meanings being very mature. my only hope is that the original creature designer is coming back.
you mean black and white films
this is long been confirmed. the original creature designer is back  and the original sound designer is back.
modern audiences pirate. and I dont even know if I want to play this esg world economic forum agenda 2030 game pirated  it makes me sick politics in videogames.
me a silent hill fan    Ive been waiting 20 years for another good sh game! mm   not so fast.... me    damn it....  hangs head in disappointment in konamI yet again
I could see these  modern audiences  go and try playing silent hill 4 and your apartment is considered your  safe space  for the first part of the game but then  itstarts to get ghosts that can kill you and no longer heals you when you come back from silent hill.
I played the game when I was 16  and I am still alive.
no wonder retro gaming is on the rise.
wow. this makes me sad. I was super excited when this was announced.
Im always sticking to old school horror games. Im still playing the original dead space trilogy
keep your safe space out of my silent hill
konamI  we are remaking silent hill 2.me  nice  I dont like to jump through hoops to play it these days.konamI  for modern audiences.me  hoops it is.
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
also  Im betting they re adjusting itso it can actually be finished by game journalists.
I dunno about you  but melonie seems to have an animegirl vibe about her.
the trailer shows a bit of the kitchen scene and it looks accurate to the original  but that doesnt mean they ll keep it in the final cut. changing pyramid head s actions will ruin a key theme in the story.
I swear these companies that think that if they keep saying it again and again enough times  maybe just maybe it might come true lol
man this really sucks. Im a silent hill fan from way back I had all the games at one time and Ive beaten them all. its one of my favorite series of all time. to hear this is really saddening. silent hill neutered is gonna blow hard .
youre going to get a ton of content from niche gamer. they re one of the only outlets left worth reading.
have a great weekend melonie!
nah... milady  let us just see how it will be. I often believe things go the shitty way. and no matter what  I am looking foward to that remake. the sh community is pretty toxic as we all know  so let us not make a mountain out of a molehill
define what is scary for modern audiences.
if they really change silent hill 2 on a fundamental level by taking out disturbing imagery or censoring entire scenes  that would be horrible. I agree they need to look at re2 remake which should be the blueprint on how to make a faithful horror game remake that in my opinion actually surpasses the original because it is scarier and if you play on hard like I did  it was very challenging in a good way. I would also consider that bloober made the medium awhile ago which was a fairly good horror game so Imight wait and see if they actually ruin silent hill 2. this article does make me nervous for sure. a bit off topic but for an old school horror game experience that doesnt hold your hand at all and actually made many of these babied modern audiences quit the game  I highly recommend scorn. some indie game developers totally get it.
the worst thing is that they make this because they think this will attract more people and in the end they loose them and the other people dont buy it because they have never interested for the game

its people blowing things out of proportion. just wait until the game comes out and give it a chance then. if youre worried about spending  70 on a game you might not enjoy then check out the reviews first.
@blue flare  oh Im going to give it a chance. I wont write anything off based off rumors. just makes me less excited. which is probably a good thing. keep my expectations more realistic lol
best comment haha!
can we all have a good cry now!
I agree with you 100 !
always assume the worst for remakes.pyramid head will now angrily approach you and give you a flower.
cant say its surprising  will they add in characters that identify as oatmeal for full representation
cd needs to trademark that phrase.
why not make new games   the same reason they dont want to make new movies or series. the ones they make dont sell because no one wants them so they slap on a name that will sell on the same game that no one wanted. sadly it works to a degree so they keep doing it.
well things like gameplay dont age well sometimes. like there are more buttons on the controller now .and they make things like camera control way smoother.
the original silent hill game is my favorite game of all time it encapsulated horror with minimalistic things the static sound on the radio and the fog. thats why I dont really play games anymore because they ve taken that away and its all cgI short movie cutscenes with a garbage story but Im hoping silent hill will stick to it what they ve done best in the past
if they were being genuine  they would make the game even more scary and intense for a modern horror audience who is jaded to gore.
thank you for talking about this
that fog added creepiness
thinks hard what the hell canthey change to make it less scary  no blood  no dark rooms  I have really no idea...
the original silent hill 2 is one of my favorite games of all time.  bloober team mostly said good things until the  modernizing due to passage of time  statement.  updated graphics  not a problem there.  updated camera  same.  they can move the camera and still give us an unsettling experience similar to the original sh2 or even more so if they get the environment right.the  modernizing  comment though  thats a concern  and they had to know that.  they have to know statements like that do not go over well.I already have a guess as to what story elements they might mess with and if Im right  one is a pretty big one.  people who played the original will be expecting _____ and get some old bs instead.they may also mess with the maria character.  I dont want to get into specifics because you haven t played the original yet  but I think thats a real possibility.certain enemy characters will be tinkered with.  they were designed a certain way because it ties into the story  but this team  going off the modernizing statement  may be more concerned about offending a certain subset of people.I hate when they mess with the classics.  I hope this doesnt turn out to be one of those times where the sistine chapel gets spray painted.
we already know about the changes to ashley in the resident evil 4 remake  and now this.  two of the greatest survival horror games turned in to generic and interchangeable action games.
Im so scared of videogames that my nanny keeps me in plastic panties  and nappies while I play them.
breaking news  pitfall to be remade for  modern audiences .  they are removing all the ropes  alligators  and pits.  walk to the right until its over.  congratulations!  you played a game!  take a screenshot and your mommy might put it on the fridge.
I knew this was going to happen.
when it comes to the horror genre  movies and tv shows have been slowly adjusting to be less scary in order to get more viewers. its disappointing aaa game studios are looking to move in the same direction. I know not everyone is into horror but trying to make games less scary and alienating the core audience is a fantastic way to lose money.
there was not to many scares in sh2 the music and ambience and story is what made it.the trailer shows that and Im ok with that
they really make me save some money again
re4 already transitioned the series into generic action. this has been a source of debate among re fans for years as despite the hate 5 gets 4 was the first to start it.also giving ashley pants equals generic action  usually generic action involves skimpier clothed women because thats what basic dumb action have besides violence to lure in teens
ashley s design is literally a mix between the original and beta version  what are you on
as long as the japanese are making the remake  there is hope.
chief marketing officer anna jasI ska  either doesnt know her job or doesnt know the customer base
the worst part is they didn t bring back akira  the iconic composer for silent hill. I will still play the game  but if they ruin it I ll be done with konamI for life  _
hey melonie its surely seemsall these changes not only thisbut everything u had discussed.that we are living in the real life demolition man minus sly stallone  dennis rodman coming from the past to the futcure.but both those guyshad to deal with that are popping up in real life tid bitsofar.all the fun things we enjoyed either movies games excetra that changed .I hopeu know what Im trying to say.thanks as always melonie for bringing these topics tolife.takecare melonie
I hope they just make more shortcuts in brookhaven and bluecreek apartment
modern audience  translation people who would get offended by jokes  and who would call u a toxic fan for not liking the stupid changes to your favorite characters in movies and video games
why when they announced this did I have a feel9ng this was gonna happen smh I been dieing for this games comeback thanks to re2 but now hearing this Im no longer hyped. I ll just rent it from gamely someday
when you have a couple of hours to study  look up the december 16th episode on samtripolI s website interview with  dr  narco longohas nothing to do with gaming but is basically 2 hours of being shown how every thing we have been taught about history itself has been carefully controlled alongside rewritten constantly  for a modern audience  to tweak the programming   control us.
contemporary  occurring in the present ... modern. every fan   Im out.
I played the original for the first time a few weeks ago and it wasn t scary. just very creepy. and Ive played just about every aaa and indie horror game since the xbox 360 era.
wtf. if I had to be terrified as a kid they should be too
soon we ll have  dark souls  for modern audiences!!
they aren t real gamers. they came in and hijacked our hobby.  huh. sounds like what happened to the tabletop gaming hobby.
they cant just make a new ip  that takes effort and talent
I swear if they tone doen how scary this game is  I ll riot in the streets
didja ever get the feeling these folks see people having fun playing video games  say   those people are having fun we must stop this reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!   then they do this kind of stuff
and this is why I was hoping for a better hd rerelease of the 2nd and 3rd game. what we got last time sucked
man I remember the day I got the original  I d just been beaten senseless and stabbed outside the game shop  by a gang of  really nice refugees  who just wanted to say hello. I specifically remembered not feelin scared hwne playing it for the first time cus my adrenaline was goin through the roof. played it the next night though n nearly pooped my own pants. thats what silent hill is known for  or was.
r.i.p. silent hill thank the good Lord I still have all my old copies  I guess fatal frame will be next.
the resident evil franchise is the only game to trust when it comes to new sequels and remakes.
actually it was wesley snipes  not dennis rodman  that was in demolition man  but I do see the resemblance lol
@ronnie perez  oh yeah my goodness how did I get that good Godlol thanks for helping me out
like what teaching about the mistreatment of natives and slavery a lot of facts are still there and two sides are still taught to every story as far my history learning has went
you just complain about the wokeness in it too though
when I hear we updated it for modern  insert here   it better be we updated it for modern hardware.
a horror game for  modern audiences   I can only imagine the monsters will misgender the player s character
my girl has some japanese horror video game  from like 2010ish  thats supposedly worth  50k. dk if its this one or not  but I kinda doubt she ll ever get that  unopened or not.was pretty cool  too  the way I remember it  but she s a millennial and Im gen x  and had been just  a tad less obsessed with  em by then. cheers
my deep sleep nightmares of og pyramid head are scarier than anything konamI will put out for  modern audiences  if this is what they are going for  I ll wait until it goes on sale rather than pay full price
every time I look at my 401k Im scared  fjb   so this is fine.
a horror game should not be watered down. that defeats the purpose of the genre completely.
updated for modern audiences is a death mark.
if the gameplay  improvement  is similar to the way re2 was improved for the remake  then Im good with it. that been said  Im still very concerned about modern adaptations.
over the sholder view would kind of ruin the game. the camera angles were what made the game s atmosphere more intense because you couldn t see what enemy was coming at you immediately.
guarantee one of these updates will be removing pyramid heads weird sexual things with the nurses and what not hopefully not because thats supposed to represent the characters inner struggle what not since he s fighting his own demons basically but I wouldn t be surprised
if I were them  I d make it much more scary for modern audiences  and then say  we adjusted it for modern audiences   so more weak ass people would get scared  and cry.
next on  the chopping block... the fatal frame series.
ah yes. let s tone down one of the things silent hill is known for. what could possibly go wrong
let s be real  no matter how they try they could ve never match the original for the scares or the feels. 1  2  and 3 og sh games were what they were  and 4 to a certain extent  and new tech actually takes away from the style of the old games. the lower resolution and limitations enhanced the old games and anything new can never be much better than parody. that being said  I was actually kinda awed at the effort I saw from the reveal trailer. there does seem to be some soul put into the game.
we made your horror game less scary.
they screwed the hd remake and now they ll tone the violence down loldlc will have pyramid head covered in  edit  just noticed the uwu thumbnail! lol  3
it was supposedly already woke in horror its called a final girl lol.
silent hill along with fatal frame were two of the creepiest games Ive played. the japanese know how to do horror. if you dont like horror dont buy horror games.
yeah  sh2 and 3 still hold up pretty good  I ain t touching this shit. its 100  gonna change many of the things we the fans love.
silent hill 2  has gotten numerous re-releases  remasters and reboots  but why not the first one
honestly  when I hear  modern adaptations   I just assume they mean an over-the-shoulder camera  and no longer having tank controls. Im completely fine with that.
uh what  silent hill 2 final  girl  is a man and he dies in one ending anyways
if its not for the old time fans its not worth spit. think I ll go play the free gzdoom2 megawads total chaos  project crypt  solace dreams  cold as hell  hotel lost contact  dismantled and soundless mound which all embrace the spine chilling motif of  the original silent hill series. check em out on mr icuras s doom mod madness channel.
do in-depth-reviews of all tomb raider games  please!
3.56. yes you are right there so focusing on storytelling then gameplay at least some companies are still re releasing old games.
this is why I recommend the enhanced edition on pc.
a lot of people suffering from a form of functional insanity nowadays in game development. imagine  a horror game that needs to be less scary  so that a certain group of people can find it more accessible. but here s the rub. these modern gamers know next to nothing about the silent hill franchise  and real gamers who are fans of the series are going to feel screwed over by the changes. which means that this game has the very real potential to not appeal to anyone. like I said  a lot of functionally insane people in game development nowadays.
silent hill comeback is dead before start it  - I should know. sigh
I ll admit  what I saw at the silent hill event and seeing the trailer for sh2 made me not even wanna play the game. I played it when it first released and I have so  so  so many fond memories of this game that tbh  I dont want to have tainted or forced to compare with a modern remake. if this version has a fan base and people enjoy it then fair play to them and Im happy about that. but for any that haven t played the ps2 game  its shame they re missing on something that was truly unique with an incredible atmosphere  soundtrack  story etc. the original team silent developers really put their all in that game and this remake will only ever come across as a cash cow. a soft cash cow for the modern audience .thanks for reporting on this melonie. keep up the great work!
retro gamming ftw
why is it the only thing they are focused on is the story    paraphrase  - lmao have you played silent hill 2
silent hill 2 was the least scary of all the games but it was the most disturbing and deepest out of all of them. tweaking itso that more people can play it is fine with me. I have already experienced the original so I will never forget that...like ever omg. I am looking forward to this on the ps5 oooh. however I wonder what they will end up doing with scenes with angela in particular  her story was quiet r rated at the very least.
the movie evil dead rise looks like no joke
we wouldn t want to scare people who want to play a horror game.
its the way she goes boys  its the f cking way she goes...
I guess   in my critical drinker voice   modern audiences  dont want to be traumatized like back-in-the-day....at least people back-in-the-day had the strength and the balls to go through with it
the game industry is not the game industry of the 2000s. its such a shame
remember  these  folx  are scared of making a phone call...
contemporary audience  sounds terrifying to me
they re really turning silent hill 2 woke please God kill meinstead of brookhaven hospital they re sending james to weenie hut general
the mistake happened ever since konamI allowed random studios to create or remake this series. silent hill has never been the same after 4. also if there are people out there that hate horror why even bother buying playing it  these people just dont want us to have fun anymore.
the reason the camera angles worked for the resident evil remakes was because they were more action based. I dont see it being as effective in this game.
the original sh2 was more focused and enjoyable because of the story not the gameplay
what s even scarier woke h.p. lovecraft.
man  itsucks seeing games I have been a fan of or heard of getting killed off for a non existent audience. hopefully games will go back to actually focusing on gameplay. which is why I just go back to old games that are heavily gameplay focused like half life  tomb raider 1  super mario 64  and ninja gaiden  both nes and modern . its a sad time for all of us gamers but we shouldn t give up. there are fans who help out through mods or fan projects.
we re afraid this comedy is too funny.
silent hill 2 is my favorite video game of all time  and quite possibly  my favorite piece of entertainment media of all time...this breaks my heart. if you feel the need to make changes for people who dont play silent hill  then dont remake silent hill.
I was looking forward to this but now Im skeptical. I would love to see a good remake of dino crisis.
they are probably going to adjust the infamous pyramid head scene.
...modernizing due to the passage of time   is so telling to the fact they will botch the story. tim burton s batman is definitive because the setting  gotham  is period eclectic.  a good horror story is the same way.
cant word things more prefecly
hopefully re4 remake keeps the scary elements. coming to think of it  I hear re4 remake will retain its original elements-with more stuff  will be scarier than the original  and based on a ratings board  will retain the decapitation-and yes  even the player character will be decapitated if you mess  like the in the original.
what primarily made silent hill stand out and become a success from the beginning is because it pushed boundaries. it may have scrapped some ideas and enemy designs that were deemed too controversial  but not to the extent of excluding controversy altogether. its unapologetically uncomfortable imagery   mature topics are absolutely crucial to its pop-cultural identity.yes  that includes cults abusing kids  dahlia   kids burning alive before birthing demons  alessa   childhood sexual trauma leading to suicide  angela   animal abuse  eddie   red pyramid assaulting other monsters  mannequin   symbolism for blooming teenage female sexuality  heather   characters designed to reflect frustrated libido  bubble head nurses  maria   mercy killing  mary   etc.those things were always intended to make us feel fear  disgust  anger  sadness  and several other emotions that no other horror franchise at the time dared to explore so explicitly  let alone execute so masterfully. to sacrifice  dilute  or otherwise change any of these aspects will by default lessen the experience because those are all irreplaceable ingredients to that experience.silent hill by its fundamental nature is deliberately offensive to varying extents and only works as a concept when it is so. its supposed to challenge us  ask us to traverse its oppressively bleak nightmare while holding a mirror up to real life issues we may not like to think about  present horrors we want to look away from but are often strangely transfixed by in their almost beautiful surrealism. its a series about being confronted with humanity s own inner devils that are made external  usually via the occult   supernatural   immersing ourselves in a protagonist s descent through a hell that tortures them without holding back  braving the abyss in their shoes with freedom to affect how they come out the other side  and potentially examining ourselves when we think back on our odyssey.this is true of all four of team silent s original games  and the series  gradual tainting by western devs who didn t understand it   modern audiences  sensibilities share blame for its decline  not just konamI . bottom line  the reality is  you either embrace silent hill in all its unadulterated  terrifying  intimate  at times sickening  non-hand holding darkness and nothing less  or it wont be silent hill.
we re not going to have any  real games anymore  aren t we
well that is sad. I am going to just pop in my dino crisis because after they screwed up the third one they will never go back to that. at least my childhood game is safe from the remake goblins.
I heard about the silent hill thing  ya cazzoyou dont need to repeat yourself
feelings aren t what they used to be.
apparently you can still make slashers where youre supposed to laugh with evil clowns mutilating kids  but a psychological horror game with metaphor monsters  no no
yay! I ll save those 70 bucks!
hey melonie! hope your day is going great! you look beautiful today.
time to make new stories.
making it more appealing doesnt sound like making it less scary to me. they mentioned game development limitations during the time it was created  and I think bloober wants to make the scareiness feel more effective or scary than if we played the same game today. old games aren t as scary as they used to be as technology advanced heavily since the 90s.
this is just depressing 90  of remakes just change or censor things to the point it loses everything of why it was loved in the first place
nah I rather give up.I dont know why though since I still enjoy occasional modern games here or there.average or not.
@chandler burse  yeah. youre right now that I am actually hearing from you. but there are still some titles to look forward to like tekken 8. I think tekken 8 is one of the few games out there that will actually be video games.
@brandon donis   I dont play tekken
@chandler burse  ah oof. I just got into it last year and am having a blast. its a good game if you like fighting games.
this is what sh fans hate tho the series isnt originally about descending into protagonists guilts its abour occultism and a dark history of a town. sh2 was the only game to originally do this then the western developed ones desperately clung to that concept.
@chandler burse   this is what sh fans hate tho- in your anecdotal experience  perhaps  but thats not representative of the fandom as a whole. a major reason why the western sh games kept trying to recreate 2 s  inner demons  angle over the years  to inferior results  is precisely because that game resonated with a significant number of players to a more successful level than the original.making james  internal strife the catalyst for the creatures he faces  the power within the town manifesting the darkest corners of his own mind to attack him  helped countless players find his story more personal   relatable. this is not to say that harry s  parent seeking missing child  premise wasn t relatable too  of course.but despite being the character we play  he wasn t the original s true main lead. virtually everything in sh 1 s events involved harry  and others  acting in response to something caused by alessa s power. it was ultimately more her story  with harry being one of several caught up in it rather than being the center of his own story. the series isnt originally about descending into protagonists guilts its about occultism- I disagree to an extent. yes  the occultism was more at the forefront in the original but the  inner mental darkness  aspects were always there. sh 1 s creatures   nightmare world were the result of alessa unintentionally projecting her inner nightmares onto the town. its not that different from james  manifestations in that both stem from the mind.the occultism in the first game was mostly only a vehicle for that. the creatures manifested by alessa s subconscious were based off of her favorite childhood story alice in wonderland  while other enemies were corrupt shades of her emotional turmoil rather than constructs of her imagination. she didn t deal with guilt like james  but did project her own inner trauma.point being  the occult is important too but none of the game s monsters   nightmares would exist without the psyche. psychological horror always played a role  even before team silent coined the term. the main differences are  a  james didn t have the power to do this himself like alessa. the power within the town did it for him  same end-result though .b  unlike james fighting enemies reflecting his inner demons  the foes harry fought were all connected to someone else s mind. he didn t have inner demons or power that could be used against him. even as harry progresses  he comments multiple times on how itseems like this is someone else s nightmare come to life. - and a dark history of a town. the town s history was present   relevant in all four original games. sh 1   3 just put more emphasis on it while 2 and 4 had it more in the background for players to piece together on their own instead of it being the conflict s driving force. even in sh 1  however  the purpose of us learning that history still tied into alessa.she was the epicenter of what everything surrounding that occult history built up to  including being the one to birth the demon God. interestingly  sh 4 did something a little similar to 1 with henry being more of a player in walter sullivan s story than the other way around and encountering walter s young self throughout. that game also had a mix of occultism   psychology. we literally enter manifestations of walter s mind  among others   at points. part of what made this twist work so well is that we re initially set up to view harry as the central character with his daughter merely being a lost child  the proverbial damsel in distress we must find   rescue.in reality  she  specifically cheryl   alessa together  being two halves of one soul  was the most important piece on the board all along and in some ways arguably saved harry as much as he saved her. it can also be interpreted as a parallel to  hell hath no fury like a woman scorned   alessa being pretty badly scorned by the cult . the western developed ones desperately clung to that concept. this is in no way sh 2 s fault. those devs chose to cling to thatspecific game s emphasis on psychological horror  and it was their incompetence   greed that kept botching it. we cant blame 2 for being good at what it did because the myriad imitators learned the wrong lessons from its success. that was their mistake.this is like when people blame all the crappy shark movies on jaws or oversaturation of zombie media on the dead trilogy. rather than hold the creators of all that crap accountable  such critics imply thatspielberg and romero did something wrong by making quality movies. their whole mindset is fallacious   childish.
@keith yes but they failed and trying to do the same thing over and over again is not good but lacks creativity many fans agree that if anything sh2s concept was better left by itself unless a dev could do it better.
@keith Imean  romero went on to make crappy zombie movies too sooooo
exactly. people are blowing things way out of proportion.
lol how often do we get what we want
whomever made that comment about gaming becoming popular  so the people get into it because they wanna be cool but hates games is so true for so many things.Imean  thats basically anime conventions  or nerd conventions in general  15 years ago.
I am probably the biggest silent hill fan you will ever see. Im pretty sure they re referring to updating controls to make it less frustrating for modern audiences. in other words you cant be scared when youre fuming because the controls aren t responding the way you need. I absolutely adore sh2 probably more than any other video game  but honestly I dont see the point of a remake if they aren t going to modernize certain control and quality of life aspects. I play sh2 regularly  but whenever I put it in front of a friend  they get frustrated with the tank controls and camera and end up not being able to enjoy it. I ll always still have the original to go back to in any case  but as one of the game s biggest fans  if youre doing a remake  I want the story 100  intact  but by all means update the gameplay. silent hill 2 was never about the gameplay anyway.
did they add safe spaces with coloring books and puppies to pet
silent hill 2 is an old school survival horror game with tank controls. as much as I love the classic resident evil and silent hill games  they ll have a hard time selling the old gameplay to modern audiences who have gotten used to smooth modern control schemes. I think that re2 remake was pretty damn good so maybe silent hill 2 remake can do the same thing.
I sadly had to quit being a gamer when then started making disc games have to be fully downloaded. my console holds 4 games
they are making the gameplay more manageable  but the issue is if they make it more action-oriented. whenever you make a horror game more action  it loses the horror. the jank of the original games made it less of a focus and not resident evil. look at the last two silent hill games and how they came off differently. the double-speak of saying they are staying faithful while altering the horror aspect is laughable and clearly meant for people that are not that bright.I do wonder what else will come out as time goes on  because I have a feeling the changes will be more and likely will match the woke film coming out alongside it.
classic!
oh hey  I run the social media for the site whose article she showcased. neat
I am so tired of woke studios thinking they can do an og game better than the people that created it.
well this is cool I was just about to watch u on infinite hope sis
we should let konamI know that their western devs are toning down the scares so konamI can crack the whip on them that we fans want the remake to be as good as the re2 remake... konamI loves money but likely not aware of whats going on in the west...
finally someone said it. glad I kept all my retro consoles. so I can experience these games in their original form. the woke people just need something to be mad at even if they have no clue what it is they re mad at they re mad just to be mad. I think we as gamers need to unite   take back our hobby.
maybe this is why retro game collecting has taken off so much.
todays movie game writers are the  beyond meat  of entertainment..  here s a thing that almost resembles a thing you love but also doesnt ... because emotions and virtue signals...
spot on... thank you!!!!!!!!!!
I love everything she s said  I used to enjoy playing video games!! now its just playing an interactive movie n laura croft back in the day was fun  now I dont care for new game
this is why you dont ever buy ea or konamI titles there s others but avoid these like the plague
oh thats why they do it. horror
if I were to remake silent hill 2  I d make it a lot more scary than the original.
thats what I was thinking too. when I hear  made for a modern audience  I just assume they mean modern controls and an over-the-shoulder camera angle. thats what modern gamers are used to  after all. I feel like people are just blowing things out of proportion and assuming the worst.
I dont play the silent hill games.  they re just not my type of game.  but to turn down the scare factor on a horror game seems silly to me.  but what do I know   Im just the customer.   shrug
when I read  for modern audience I took it as they re either going to censor the angela stuff or the maria stuff. I dont think they re aiming it at making it less scary. that misses the point of a horror game entirely. that would be like making a football game and saying youre removing tackling.
at this point  I agree about ports over remakes. just make the classics easily available. re2 and ff7 are two of my favorite games of all time and both remakes either disappointed me or just flat out pissed me off.
so the nurses wont look sexy.
melonie you should play all 4 first silent hill and fatal frame project zero games on stream
6 58 so like with scooby-doo star wars you know everything else they re keeping the name but changing basically everything
modern day horror style  translation  jump scares  a la 5 nights...also  hey  konamI  remember the first time you tried to remaster silent hill and took away the fog
about gameplay  there s a few things that make sense changing. even though og silent hill 2 is considered a masterpiece  it doesnt mean every aspect of the gameplay was good haha. some things were just frustrating and some puzzles and boss fights were poorly designed. so Im actually ok with them changing a lot gameplay wise.so long as they give you the option to still have tank controls if you want  its ok.
you are very cool  I love your videos
gaming has been mid since 2014  with a few exceptions  and Imean very few   I hardly buy or complete games in the last 9 years. its depressing for someone  whose been a gamer since the late 80s
the nurses will be doing tiktok and snapchat dancing
it has become unfortunate in the united states  the internet is a private activity  where nobody else can view what we are doing  and it is utterly volunteer to go anywhere on the internet  you have to go through a series of steps to go anywhere  and this is for each individual  that makes it a private choice   I turn on my web browser encryption to be by default  you have to look  on firefox  it is partial  thatsometimes and sometimes not   because I enjoy my privacy of my choices.  big tech knows this  as they are creating a.i. driven echo chambers  to find content  by our preferences  by what we use the internet for.  big tech  activists  and government are hurting our abilities to enter our personal time  choices  and views  in order to control us  as if we are all one person in public choices.  the irony of it all  we are answering trolls who want to be pleased for themselves at our expenses  and then they lie and claim some kind of non-existent freedom that they give nobody.  in all marketing  advertisement  and business  it is about the target audience  because  by example  you dont sell a hammer to people looking for dress shirts for men  with a pocket   and this changes who will come into the clothing stores and hardware stores  it is about statistics  targeted advertisement  and desired market. because we are looking at a.i. driven technology  I have made comments here about my preferences  and who I am  because I love myself   because I dont like being denied my own choices  this brings up some stuff in the recommended content.  I love curvy women  and I love laura croft of the tomb raider series.  when the actress angelina jolie played laura croft in the tomb raider movies  she became a person to me  because she is beautiful and smart.  those people who dont like curvy women  is there not something else to do  like maybe a game of scrabble  because you asked to be there
I predicted this early on  not because of scares  but because silent hill 2 has a lot of r pe content  there s a sa survivor character and many of the monsters simulate stuff along those lines. its a very mature game about a man wrestling with guilt and shame
made for the modern e-boy girl audience not for the fans basically
for modern audiences due to the passage of time  when in this time the modern audience is throwing flaming crap on the wall just for misgendering thier pronouns and call rape if a man just tries to tell them to move out of their way oh this game is going to be glorious
they really dont want my money.
Im not even that big of a silent hill fan and this still upsets me. I thought the whole point of the series was that it was supposed to be scary af  why take away the heart  thats like making a re game and taking out the zombies- oh wait they already did that.
silent hill has been my obsession for like 14 years  have multiple copies of each title and just got my second tattoo. this sucks bro  but we ll always have the originals. sh going woke would kill the series and the series was already practically dead ffs
Im glad I got the collection on my xbox now Im not so mad that the new silent hills not coming to xbox Im good
the modern audience  is a fictional creature designed as an excuse for a game or movie s failure due to intersectionalism by the creators.
fnaf was made by a Christian conservative ironically.
the remaster was using a broken beta version of the game because they lost the source code
they re updating the scary aspects of the game. thats the opposite of  ok . its appealing to a crybaby generation of timid adult babies that would scream if their alphabet soup was too hot. all game developers should ignore the snowflakes and make a serious survival horror game.
@eyes of ascension  I know that  I was commenting on gameplay changes. melonie said remakes should be faithful to the gameplay but I disagree with that. if the gameplay sucks  which it does  then being faithful to trash makes no sense.
a lot if people theorize the entire games is an allegory for sexual themes but the devs have even supposedly been like that wasnt the intention 100  beyond maria and angela.
pyramid head being theorized as a rapist in the mannequin scene is a significant one.
@chandler burse  yeah  its hard to talk too deeply about the themes and specific scenes and monster designs of the game without spoiling it. suffice it to say  my point was that as soon as I heard of the remake  I thought they d probably be making changes to  fit a modern audience
@plain simple garak  as far as the remake shows those scenes you mentioned havent been removed
I ll take the horror game  minus the horror please..... said no one ever
they did that to all the games  the mmo s used to be popular when they offered lots of choices  had good stories  etc. but all them keep making the games more cookie cutter builds and less choices to cater to the idiots that dont really care about the game... just how fast they can hit max lvl and move on...
just like the recent saints row dumpster fire the developers of this remake are going to find out the hard way that their  contemporary  audience does not exist  outside of twitter.
what a shame I guess Im skipping this one and just play the original
what happened to making content for specific audiences and making a budget that makes sense for that and making millions of dollars in profit from giving your audience what they wanted  now its all about trying to maximize profits by trying to appeal to the widest audience possible and so they end up loosing so much of their game s identities and inevitably usually ends with their core fan base leaving disgruntled and the ip eventually suffering from this and in the long run hurt s their sales as well.the tactic of making something that tries to appeal to people outside of the usual fan base for entertainment works out only sometimes most of the time its a recipe for disaster and an identity crisis of the material.
screw this! I ll be playing the original silent hill 2 again.
getting away from the remakes and focusing on newer stand alone games  you should try alien  isolation   last of us or evil within. those have came out in the past few years and are newer games with a original story  straying away from the remakes. I wish people were focusing more on graphics than the story. times were better back then.
I appreciate that you only speak facts.
I think when the mayans said that the world was going to end in 2012 I believe misinterpreted might have been
this is exactly why no one should ask for a remake of any old game. because they re going to modernize it and take it away from its original game and change it.
the woke hill in silence 2
re gripe was enemy design  silent hill2 problems are going to be blaring obvious will affect the story and atmosphere by a larger margin than gameplay. they could have done silent hill 1 which isn t as thematically heavy but its going to be shot in the kneecaps for 2 for obvious reasons involving the themes.
capcom did an amazing job with the remake of re2 . why not try to keep the horror  but at least only update the graphics. no one has a problem with gameplay  horror  music and the story.
give me my hype back!
the moment bloober team was announced I was disappointed.  they can say they get it all they like.  I dont care about what they say  their actions say otherwise.
what is the outro song  I kinda dig it.
well obviously. didn t you guys see what they made james look like  thats the most beta look he could get
Im old lol. my first system was intellivision. I dont play any console games newer than ps3. Im happy playing my older games.
this my greatest video game of all time   Imight be in the minority but wish this game was not being remade. horrible horrible news
I am really looking forward to this I will be really upset video games is going downhill
adjusting the scares for  a modern audience  probably means they are aiming for people who think five nights at freddie s is too intense.fuck.
spot on about too many in society being too soft. I saw that myself recently with a book I published about a dinosaur devouring a tour group in australia. one amazon reviewer complained about all the gore and cursing I had in the book. a book with a dinosaur attacking people  what the heck did this person expect would be in it.snowflakes dont like gore  scary stories  and too many f-bombs. what a bunch of joyless  whiny plonkers.
the  modern audiences  that dont exist.the ones that dont buy nor play any of these games  they dont show up at conventions  events  shows  tournaments  movies  concerts  arenas  etc  etc  etc  etc  etc.
oh yes let s make a remake of a game we re trying to be faithful to thats meant to be scary and apart of the horror genre not scary for the snowflakes...this is like making an mk game without the blood and gore because they re afraid of offending someone note mk vs dc dont count since dc was involved  talking pure mk game
oh come on!!!! its a freaking horror film!!!
if there s one good thing that will come out of this its that there will be more people buying the original and enjoying it very much. as  naturally  they should. thats what I do. every time that I see another game  movie  or series being ruined I simply buy the much more entertaining og version.
the reboot tomb raider series feels more like uncharted than tomb raider.
trying to figure what will happen to dead space and resident evil 4 as well...
well  sadly its more like  renewing  these attacks. I think we were spoiled by a time period of eminem controversy and south park to push the envelope.
something tells me the nurses are about to be flat and covered.
the biggest irony is that woke cities are looking more like silent hill in real life.
if I wasn t japanese I d be embarrassed to talk about how were going to change a japanese game to improve it. that makes me think the changes are subversive. should be a little ashamed to say what they said out loud.
people hate to be scared now
making things  appropriate    for  everyone  totally ignores genres .
capcom looking at konamImy dear rival  is a shaped of its former self. I know longer recognize.
I hate this so much  and this is coming from a person who literally just started playing video games 6 years ago  my first game was the last of us  I had always wanted to try playing but my brothers never allowed me to touch their playstations back then so I just sat with them and watched. I bought a used playstation 3 from my cousin and I have been playing since then  silent hill 2 and 3 on my other playstation 2 my uncle gave me  I loved them!!  I have played downpour and homecoming too  but we dont talk about those tho   the horror  how they twist your thoughts and mind  how they make you think about the characters as the story moves forward  the way it creeps you out! its the best!
a company who lost its soul cant even imagine doing a game with any kind of soul. updating for a modern audience is an admission of thatsame lack of soul.of course  in this case  soul mean thatspark that made us love their product and their work. but there can be more than one interpretation.
haha sad day for silent hill fans  not for me! I have silent hill 1 2 3 and 4. I can pop them in my ps2 at anytime and replay them all. I ust feel bad for any new people coming in and having to play that as I have spoken of silent hill a lot to some people so sucks for new folks coming in they wont get to experience the games at their best but me  heh I laugh in my having the og games. while others can just go and emulate them.
this video terrified me!
they re trying to make the scare factors  more appealing   isn t the whole point of scary to not be appealing !
the original is hard to find for an easy price and is considered abandonware. unless they want the broken remastered version or own a good pc to play the original on.
play the original on what  its unplayable for people like me. the game wasn t ported to newer consoles.
re4 still looks great
its a remake there is going to be changes for better or even worse thats how it is and the old combat just doesnt work for modern gaming anymore.and hell even fans have agreed on thatsometimes
thankfully I still have the xbox original version and Im keeping it forever.
at this rate  we should all just buy used ps2s with used copies of silent hill 2.
silent hill 2  e for everyone
at this point  updated for a modern audience  is no longer the cursed words.the real cursed word is  remake . how people still get excited and have hope for remakes nowadays is beyond me  Im not surprised by this at all.
didn t blooper try to get us to sympathise with a p3do in the medium  that richard character if Im not mistaken.
if you dont like silent hill 2  then dont play it  simple!
8 00  why are they using these terms when they know they trigger us  so they can use you as free marketing for the game... I didn t even know it was being made until seeing this video... the bastards got us. they ve turned our own indignation into their marketing campaign...
Imiss video stores
they need a snowflake slider for games so normal people can enjoy the non watered down versions
ah shit  wont give it a chance then.
hopefully independent gaming moders will provide scary mods you can install and fix the game as to be more scary. I think this is the future of gaming  where we wait until the game is old enough as to be cheap to purchase  patched so it is playable from a technical point of view and then add mods to it to make it playable and enjoyable. too bad the console players dont have access to mods and other nice things like pc gamers do.
at this point thats why I dont want remakes of old games.
its seems like all the good stuff was made ps1-2 and everything is now  just remakes of that era because itseems like the industry has no room for creativity or just taking a risk on on original ideas anymore because everything needs to hit check boxes before it gets a ok and usually those things ruin it
great. now I fully accept thatsilent hill will never be fixed or saved.
these companies and corporations are following the same plan as the movies  get an old ip remake it to their new standards and cash in on it. look at star wars  rings of parasites etc
sh2 wasn t bad but it and all the following games lost the feeling of creepiness loneliness and hopelessness of the original game as the series progressed they went more for monster types and a very watered down gore factor resembling re more and in my opinion losing its soul.
modern audiences should play the room. probably destroy their lives. damn that game was horrifying.
I cant really take anything seriously from a dev called bloober. there is no way this works out
maybe  just my opinion  developers are after money. they see people are sensitive nowadays due to schools coddling and trying to make everyone an activist upon graduation that they re needing to go in  another direction  we grew up in a different time. a different culture. I hate to see where we are headed. just a thought
when they say modern audiences for this is ridiculous to me. movies aren t even scary anymore
cant wait for the remake to say  maybe angela s dad wasn t so bad!
people hated silent hill 4
I think its hilarious that people thought the original silent hill 2 was scary. the first was definitely scarier and james deserved everything he got.
hold it  hold it. adjusting the scare factor for a contemporary audience  I dont like horror games in general  so I simply dont play them. no need to make them less scary. not all game genres are for everyone  you know. capcom in the past tried to attract the cod audience with re and look what happened. what they want to do with silent hill sounds worse
dont worry we have the old stuff.
for a modern audiance  said every game developer that failed  ever
why dont they just make a movie about burning cash
if its being made for a  modern audience.  anything good you d normally get from a horror game is going to be taken out of it to be politically correct. lol
I am honestly sick of the over the shoulder camera angle of so many modern horror games. what made original horror games frightening besides the limited graphical capacities of the hardware was the fixed camera angles where you had limited control of where you can see  especially around corners! God I really am getting sick of gaming in general as time goes on because of these  modern  updates
triangle man bad.
game play is always updated when they make remakes. look at what they did with final fantasy! I love the original atb turn based system. I would have loved to have that in the remake. their argument was  if we did everything the original did but only upgraded the visuals  it would be a remaster  not remake.
one of the things that drives me insane is the people who were gamers coming to defend this crap because they dont want to be seen as a  bad  gatekeeping person  give me a break!
silent hill 2 was never thatscary anyway really. they shower you with health items and ammo and the enemies aren t very threatening to fight. it has a really clever story and a good atmosphere though.
buy the game  play it for less than 2 hours  refund it  and blast it with bad reviews. dont re-purchase it even when its on sale. let it fail. thats all these rejects pretending to be  developers  understand is money and sales. thats why they re doing this in the first place. they think that the title of the game alone is going to make them tons of money because its  silent hill . show them that titles dont matter and content does. force them to go broke.
dude Im mad literally all they had to do was update graphics and some smoother game play thats it the game was perfect how it was
konamI should pair the remake of sh2 with the original. I think that would impact the blow of disappointment that is to come from the remake. that way if the remake does suck then we all got an s tier horror game. port not from hd collection
konamI does it again
to be fair silent hill 2 is not scary for me but memorable especially the message and story
at one point we gotta call these games what they sadly truly are   not remasters  not remakes  but dampened and shallow adaptation. when konamI favors bloober team for a sh project this is a red flag already   their walking simulators in horror-inspired themes are nice for what they are but cannot hold a candle to true classic psychological horror games like the og silent hill games  so konamI choosing their pitch over many other studios paints a dull origin story for the project s inception.
push button to win game.
oh boy!!! is pyramid head gonna be gahey ! !  I bet he s gonna be gaheyheyhey!!! oh well konamI will always have their pachinko machines to fall back on.  r.i.p. silent hill...again.  and probably every other remake in planning.  lmao
uhhhhhhh! Im glad I have the original sh2.
re1 remakes fixed camera sucked in my opinion it needed to be further away from the character like re2 and silent hill.when it random zooms in on jills ass it isnt nice fanservice its annoying and confusing to know where Im going.
right.  remade for a modern audience  is most likely referring to the game having an over-the-shoulder camera angle and not having tank controls.
@blue flare  Im sure a lot of changes in terms of the fear  suicide  self harm  etc. will be changed and dulled down as this generation is pussified.
they already changed the camera angles anyways
why does it need to be remade  it was perfect the first time...
the graphics are already being made for  modern audiences   like the horrible expressions and face of james . so what can we expect from konamI and bloober team  nothing really.
so we were little hard nuts back in the day
melonie do you not know about the tomb raider anniversary remake for xbox 360 ! its a perfect adaptation of the classic first game!!!! its possible! I want konamI to sell their ip s so someone can remake castlevania symphony of the night  keep it 2d but update the graphics like in or better than bloodstained. give it to iga!
updated for modern adult baby s
take a beloved franchise and remake it for modern audiences translates into something like  we shall use nostalgia to get the oldies and change things up to get the younger crowd in to squeeze all the money we can out of them. and when the oldies aren t happy about it we use the sjw buzzword list to  guilt-shame  them and get free pr.problem with this tactic is that its not working so good anymore. at least not in the movie and industry.I vote with my wallet!
okay... hear me out  folks. I think that we need a gaming speakeasy. a place where real gamers go to play old-school games like the original silent hill 2  the tomb raider series  etc. its a bit farfetched but I think that it could work.
wait and see. this article doesnt give much info so we cant definitively say it will be bad. then again even if it is good  the og fans will hate it anyway just because its new.
3 predictions off the top of my head 1. the bubblehead nurses will be  desexualized  or turned male.2. the  good  ending will be removed  because a  toxic male  like james doesnt deserve it.3. the ph kitchen scene will be replaced with him catcalling the mannequin- on second thought  no  thats still too intense for modern audiences.
so didn t they already do this game  I think it was called. . . . . . . .metal gear survive. . . !
silent hill 2 s remake is being handled by the same assholes who made blaire witch  the medium  and layers of fear. if that wasn t the massive red flag itshould ve been  at least now you have the most obvious one. I was really hyped for it at first  but just seeing bloober team in there immediately crashed my hype train and made even forget it was being developed.
new movies for modern  audiences  coming soon!  texas chainsaw paddy cake.   friday the 13th  crystal lake summer of rainbow love.   halloween  michael meyers learns to speak using preferred pronouns.
yay melonie !
honestly  if they could do this right. such as making it more action packed and focusing on james s sunderland s wife and her deranged  vengeful quest to punish him.sort of like an ahab type character trying to get the whale no matter the cost.  and in the latter half.james finally snaps out of his obsession of finding his wife alive and making peace. ultimately realizing the fact that whatever entity he s dealing with. its not his late wife and never was.  I could see an awesome mid-boss fight where maria turns against and fights james and a final boss fight where mary alternates between her maria alter ego and her final form.also  I like to see the cult from silent hill 1 make an appearance.  maybe helping james from the shadows. perhaps a story arc where the mary is actually a powerful rogue entity at conflict with the group. preventing their return to silent hill. thus  cult members throughout the campaign aid james in taking down her down once and for all. I for one would like to see at the beginning of the game. james making a pitstop through shepard s glen  from silent hill homecoming  or ashfield   from silent hill 4  and unknowingly interacting with cult members who tail him into silent hill.
unfortunately horror in all phases has been dead for years
I guarantee what gets adjusted  for a modern audience  is the sexy scary nurses. even though it is part of the story  eye candy  or precieved  is a no-no.
glad I already own the hd version of silent hill 2  it also came with sh3.next I bet they take the grand theft out of gta.
ill just have to play the original silent hill 2 for the xbox 360
just wait till they decide to make their dark souls remake.
well the original is always there
because it is literally not accessible to new players.
no its not perfect  its the playskool version of tr1 that was severely watered down and bland. the manor is the only improvement  otherwise inferior in every way
dude this is just called clubs. you can find them at colleges and other places.people have clubs for retro gaming and specific games like smash bros melee tournments still exist as well
hahaha
this is completely different from the plot of the original game though and theres multiple endings where james comes to different conclusions.only one of them sort of ends in him believing his wife wasn t real but he believed she never existed at all and he denies his actions and then he repeats the cycle of guilt.
the cult wouldnt help james the cult wants their God to be reborn unless he benefits that I dont see why.and as far I am aware the cult during sh2 is not active for whatever reason likely because they are trying to find a way to get alessa or whatever to have her birth their God.this plot sounds like a butchering of sh2s story it doesnt sound like it would please anyoneand considering what this comment contains itsounds like either a joke or fanservice.
@chandler burse  the way I can see this playing out. the remake could be a continuation of the original silent hill 2 game if it follows the  rebirth  ending. in a nutshell  james stumbles on the  church of the rebirth and using the order s arcane rituals  resurrects  his wife.and of course  it goes horribly awry. as you d expect in a place like silent hill mary is resurrected as a powerful vengeful entity and the town is cursed to repeat a time loop. where the events of sh2 is replayed over and over again. like a twisted version of  groundhog day now  enter the order.remnants of the cult would be holed up in nearby shepherds glen. regrouping  waiting for the time to make their return to silent hill.however...their plans are constantly thwarted as the mary entity has the town on lockdown. standing in the way. preventing the order from returning and summoning their God.over time  various reports from field scouts would make their way back to the group. they would learn of events constantly replaying over and over with some variables as james is the main focal point. now...depending on how many months or years james has been stuck in that loop.the order would amass enough data on repeated events to the point where from the shadows  they aid him not to defeat mary but to stretch out his journey and throw enough curve balls to where mary is so distracted by james. the order can quietly slip in. reverse that botched ritual on rebirth island and break the curse. just long enough for james to finish her off once and for all. ridding the town of her presence for good. taking back silent hill after so many years..just to be clear.the order wouldn t be doing this out of any kindness or any altruism.no. this would be a case of  the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
@megacide84  that is a sequel not a remake
@megacide84  taking silent hill  from what  the cult is part of the reason it is what it is but the other factor is that the games imply the towns always sort of been  alive  and that it was once a place of spiritual power for the natives that lived there.
@megacide84  also rebirth is just one of many endings the ending most fans prefer is the leave but the ending devs and many fans reluctantly consider the most canon is the suicide one  in water
@chandler burse  yes  silent hill was somewhat alive and radiating spiritual power long before the cult  however...that power was always held at bay. it wasn t until the cult dragged it out in the open and fully unleashed it during the events of origins.unfortunately  with the demise of dahlia the cult leader and high priest at the end of sh1.the group lost control of that power and like a frankenstein scenario. where dr. frankenstein creates his monster  then losses control and the monster turns against him. without someone to contain that power. the town for lack of a better term  went feral and in the ensuing chaos and havoc.drove remaining order members out. hence the exile at shepherd s glen.now  regarding james and the rebirth ending. Imyself prefer the leave ending. however  the rebirth ending would be a good continuation of the original sh2. imagine if you will. a grif stricken james. broken down shell of his former self. zero knowledge of occult arcane rituals. haphazardly trying to resurrect his wife. rushing through the ceremony and making mistakes.perhaps casting the summoning spell from sh1 in error.instead of having his wife returned and finally leaving together in peace.some evil entity breaks through and merged with mary s body. add to the fact james s guilt  anger  and rage would hyper-charge that atmosphere and thus  be absorbed into said evil entity.I d imagine that would give birth  no pun intended  to a powerful  twisted  vengeful maria mary creature hell bent on punishing james for all eternity.now finally the order.this would make a good backstory of where and what the cult was doing between the events of silent hill 1 2. considering that the mary maria entity would be the de-facto dominant power in this version of silent hill 2.Im pretty sure it wouldn t take too kindly on a strange group of cultists muscling in on its territory. trying to set up shop and potentially summoning a rival entity that would challenge its power. that is why the group would reluctantly aid james in his quest. anything to get back the town of silent hill. no matter what.
@megacide84 origins happens after sh2 you know that  sh2 has been confirmed to take place in the 80s which is before sh1 and origins which happens right before sh1so youre already wrong there
@megacide84 no one wants a direct continuation of sh2 story dude
you mean the broken remastered one with troy baker voice over
if thats the one for 360 then ya...sure... -_-
they need these games to mock anyone that chooses an easy mode. similar to what the wolfenstein games did whenever itshows blaskovitz wearing a baby bonnet with a pacifier in his mouth.
silent hill isn t the only game that reducing its scary approach  this happened to resident evil 8 village were there was complaints of people who played resident evil 7 saying the game was  too scary  have these people never played or watch a scary game movie in their life
seriously  what s the point of doing a remake of a popular horror game if youre just going to water the fear down   if anything  they should be looking at ways to kick things up a notch.  longtime fans might want a little more than a 1 1 recreation and newcomers are going to have high expectations.
remember how bad the hd remakes  especially silent hill 2  were on ps3   xbox  those were a result of tech issues hurting the experience  this will be intentional. this  update  will be a horror game but for the wrong reasons
cant wait to buy this game when its 5 dollars discount like mgs5  mgs5 was a great game btw I ll would still buy that game full price.but not silent hill remake if its downscaled for  modern audiences
they need to ban haunted houses because some people were scared.
damn I didn t like re8 because they did the same thing. re7 was apparently too scary for woke journos so they turned resident evil into something that little children can play. but why lol. its not supposed to be for children.imagine if miyazakI also did this... well he kinda did actually lol. but in the case of elden ring its different because its just giving you more ways to play the game. elden ring could be extremely easy if played with magic  summons etc. or hard if you decided not to use the bubble wrap safety padding. but the game still wasn t holding your hand.
this remake is dead to me now. good thing we still have silent hill f and I hope that one actually tries to do something good with the franchise considering its being developed by an actual japanese team.
step 1  make silent hill 2 remakestep 2                 step 3  profit
give these gamers an old school nes and see how they survive. battletoads  contra without the 30 man code  mega man 1  castlevania  zelda iI  blaster master  ninja gaiden.
modern audience all 10  of them
updating the scare factor for the modern audience   replace the monsters with people in maga hats probably
Im not going to complain because this what konamI wanted. dont see why people are complaining for.
dose this mean they will  modern treatment  the game duck hunt   sorry Im old. but I thought its funny. yea water!!!
they are going to make itso can buy the m4a1 and ak-47 for  15 each  and you can log in daily for free ammo and health pack refills. or you can drop  2.99 for extra refills.
ah yes. the  modern audience  that doesnt buy their games.
the older silent hill games were scary due to the limitations of the ps1   ps2. the iconic fog in silent hill was due to rendering issues  it was an accidental art style. the silent hill hd collection flopped because they couldn t re-create the fog in a scary way. the low resolution made the textures uglier and scarier. this is a major issue with modern games and then you through woke politics on top of the shiny new remake and its game over  no one is having fun.
Ive been a gamer for over 40 years. I think this is the worst period for actual games. nothing is exciting  nothing is challenging  and all Im expecting now from games is a lecture about how evil I am for being white while I walk around a dull open world even more depressing than my home town. elden ring has entertained me alot though and I  complete it twice  but thats because its fromsoft and they make games.
remade for a    moduurn odiieenceeeeesssss  critical drinker
any silent hill fan knows the gameplay is the least important part of the game. story is king.
for modern audiences    doa
8 was much scarier than 7. the baby part yikes!!
@patrick robinsob  but there were still complaints from players saying the parts in re7 were  too scary  you have to check angryjoes review on re8 village. he does rant about the re7 complaints.
the hd collection failed because they lost the source code and was using a beta version which meant the game was essentially incomplete
@chandler burse  that too  its really sad. Im glad I still have all of the original games still.
Ive given up konamI doing silent hill right. I wish that would just add all the original games to consoles stores and then step away for good.
these freaking developers and publishers need to grow a pair and have the guts to just do something right instead of rounding off the edges of everything that might be offensive. if youre always worried about offending someone  you ll end up making something with no bite. it makes for bad art. the horror of the best silent hill games is what helps makes the story so meaningful  especially in sh2. it wasn t just scary for the sake of being scary  it became a means of exploring the darkest parts of the characters  and emphasized the things that the characters themselves were afraid of. the interplay of the horror and the story is why sh2 is so beloved. stop trying to fix what isn t broken. it will do you no good and will earn you no goodwill with us  the fans. I was already skeptical about the remake  but now Im really worried. Im not going to buy it if it isn t scary like the original was.
I think it will be fine
nothing turns me off faster than  for a modern audience.  although in this case  itseems less politically motivated and more simply wanting to be  mainstream.  you know  dilute the product so as to appease everyone... and risk losing the audience you already had.
you got wrong since konamI is too close of the project not letting bt making big changes
iI know its asking too much from konamI  but  they coulda just added the option in the menu options to have the game censored if one so desired... Im afraid that when re4 comes out konamImight get so much crap for silent hill 2 not being as scary as capcom s re4 remake or the original silent hill 2 that they wont make as much sales as projected then will only stick to pachinko...
the way video game companies act lately  makes it feel like games aren t being made for gamers anymore. sadly  as a business model  I can understand that they re trying to attain a whole different sector of customers. video games have  in recent times  had record sales. they tasted blood and just want more of it. the problem  in my humble opinion  is that even though these companies keep treating us like sale numbers and just simple customers  we aren t treating them like just a simple business company. we still treat them like a hobby. we treat them like that abusive ex partner that we keep going back to hoping that they had changed and expect change. I can say  speak with your wallet cause that hurts them the most  unfortunately  enough people will just buy it to justify them making these changes time and again. also about @5 48. here s my personal experience. so I love spicy foods. I love burning my mouth and the physical pain that comes with trying the hottest stuff out there. so there was this dish I used to order at this one restaurant. one day as I was eating I noticed it was nowhere near as spicy as it once was. Imade a passing remark about it and was told by the workers that they got complains that it was too hot for some people. then I said  well they could ve just either gotten the much milder version or the non spicy version. logical right  a group near by then said  well we wanna be able to try the spicy version without having to burn . I then said that they could order the mild version. and they straight up replied that it wouldn t be spicy unless itsaid so and that they wanted the spicy. one of the workers later told me that people like me are not very common and they sell more for those other types therefore they make more money. he said he didn t like it cauee loyal customers like me got shafted  but it made more business. as a business it makes sense. but I lost a wonderfully spicy place. I think its the same with games. like with tiktok  people wanna desperately be a part of the most popular trends  regardless of the damage that it causes in the wake of it. sorry for my little rant. have a wonderful day.
I never like the horror that bloober team do  now I will save money on this remake  thank you  I bet they will change angel orosco plot line because its to dark for modern audiences   or they will turn her background for full  man bad  poor woman
this really depresses me  they are already ruining witcher 1  tomb raider and fable. makes me want to just stick to older games. also about your gameplay needs to be the heart of a remake  ffviI and crisis core did a great job with it!!
they re going to add light switches james canturn on so the player doesnt get too scared. pathetic...
this happened with resident evil village  the developers thought that re7 was to scary so they  balanced the scares and lowered the tension curve
I didn t like silent hill 2 because of all of the hard r imagery. but I know I d never want that censored and I know they are going to remove thatstuff. horror is supposed to make you uncomfortable. if it does  it did its job. what a novel concept of not wanting things you dont like removed or censored  huh
thats code for we are ruining the story and not to buy the game.
gotta love when people twist words around in order to fit their own views.  remade for a modern audience  is most likely referring to the game having an over-the-shoulder camera angle and not having tank controls.
nice thumbnail! just imagine. lmao
they want to make a horror game less intense  oh boy  this is going to go well. also  the  modern audiance  lie gets old. we all know what that means and its why I generally dont like remakes.
truely been a silent hill fans is only torture  Imean it  I was expecting something good a kin to the original first 4 games but no  well tbh the only silent hill game that they announced that actually interested me was silent hill f
hard times make hard men. hard men make soft times. soft times make soft men. soft men make hard times.
the original wasn t even scary lol. it was definitely creepy and uncomfortable  but not scary. if anything I hope they take inspiration from the remake of resident evil 2 and make itscarier than the original. the gameplay of the original sh2 was also extremely clunky and unintuitive so changing it is a good thing. the story is the most important part of sh2 so focusing on keeping that the same is the right thing to do
noooo.  Im sick of the  modern audience  that all these weirdos are ruining beloved franchises for
they literally cant do that for sh2 since the last time they tried to remaster it they lost the source code so it will always be broken
crisis core remake is so good!!
again the baby scene in 8 was scarier than all of 7
less scarier  huh....cant wait to hear the cries of horror when they find out the real reason james is in slient hill  and what pyramid head is a representation of. then again  Im sure the only exposure the writers will have of the series is the movies  and none of the original lore will matter.
ugh  come on!! what s wrong with disliking blood and gore in video games !
thats fine. canthey release a version for an un contemporary audience  silent hill 2  bigot nightmare edition. I wanna play silent hill not notting hill.
we ve reached the sissification of society
silent hill for modern audiences.isn t that just presenting the world of the game with conservatives being represented as the right ones
you know if they replaced the monsters with unattractive overweight women and changed pyramid head into barrel gut with blue hair  that would actually be terrifying lol!
where s this mythical modern audience that never shows up and buys their s    that they keep making their s    for
a  modern audience  does not exist. if a game gained a great amount of respect  or was great to play  then it ll more than likely have the same effect today  there are exceptions  usually when is comes to clunky controls or visuals  but I have never found a movie or game that was great back then but isn t today or vice versa . silent hill 2 executed horror  story  gameplay  and puzzle-solving very very well. Im sure there were a lot of people turned off or disgusted by the sexual implications and the horror  but there were many many more that found the experience dam near unforgetting and a delight  and those are the poeple that found intrest in the game. by changing the game into something that appeals to those who didn t like the horror  story  puzzle  or whatever else  you are making those who loved the game turned off against it.
wait isn t lara croft triangular  and not curvy  .   .
its sad that konamI destroys everything they touch  now im not interested in getting this remake...
and remember silent hill 2 was probably the least scary silent hill so this decision makes even less senseedit  least scary of the original 4  not counting any game outside team silent
oh cool! so  instead of creepy and twisted mannequin nurse demons with an oddly attractive female body  were going to have fat dudes in a nurse outfit with large bulges........honestly  thats much more scary and disturbing. but Im all for having no swear words  violence  jump scares  puzzles  weapons  combat  music  or loading screens. maybe it will just be a blank screen that we stare at instead of playing a survival horror game. wait  we cant have a blank screen  because then the game will be accused of  huwite washing .
using the words  modern audience  automatically makes it too scary for me to buy.
I ll say it again and again  sh2 doesnt need remaking  silent hill needs the remaking and it needs to be a japanese studio. stop licensing to western nations. except mercury steam doing metroid dread but under tight production direction from nintendo. dread was awesome. sh2 is fine  played the ps2 disc last winter  it doesnt need remaking. the hd version was redubbed and itsucked. meanwhile silent hill is 32 bit 3d polygonal nightmare that can use a makeover. they wont though  whole reason to redo sh2 is money.
need mordernising due to the passage of time Im out. after hearing that anyone who buys this literally has no one else to blame if they hate it  like saints row fans who bought the reboot
hahaha already seen that coming...Jesus Im sick of this crap...ugh
good God.  I was excited.  I was more pumped about silent hill than re4 remake honestly.  welp whatever  gonna forget it exists since im sure that means its gonna suck.
silent hill was second place compared to resident evil was because of konami
I guarantee that this  modernizing  is removing any and all references to james  sexual frustrations which manifested as sexy monsters and that one particular scene with pyramid head. you can put money on that.granted that wont ruin the game as a whole but it will diminish the character s pain and regret as well as his connection to the town itself which is the entire fkin point of the town s curse to begin with. its supposed to be uncomfortable. its supposed to be gross and confusing and just kind of messed up because its literal torture for the main character.I get why people dont like it but if they dont like it then they should just play something else instead. they re real quick to say  its not for you so dont watch play it  but then they just refuse to leave things that aren t for them well alone.
final fantasy seven remake was so terrible that it has completely killed my appetite for any and all remakes. this is the first one in a while that I was looking forward to  not anymore.
the scene with pyramid head is literally in the trailer at least the beginning of itso unless they removed that afterwards then no youre already wrong.and maria being in the game kind of suggests his sexual frustrations will still be present
@chandler burse  ah yes  trailers. always trustworthy and perfectly representative of the games. nothing from a trailer has ever been missing from the final product at all  no sir.also its not just maria but please  keep shilling. Im sure you ll get noticed.
@that guy with the face  the trailer was in game engine.it could be a lie sure but what we saw makes this more difficult to even confirm you peoples suspicions.
@that guy with the face  I know its not just maria and get noticed by who  this comment section is filled with dudes randomly and creepily complimenting melonie so if you want to argue with attention seekers they are her fans not me.the nurses have been shown in screen shots they are actually strangely more sexual as they wear garters now and still seem curvy and cleavage exposed.all I did was reply what what I know. dont take itso hard dude for God sakes.
if you dont want to get scared while playing a video game maybe dont play something in the horror genre
as a tail-end boomer  I d like to apologize for my generation.  while I didn t  too many of us created  participation trophy pussies that are destroying everything of value.  clearly this  softer  gentler  affirming  parenting was a disaster.
its silent hill! youre getting into some dark shit when you look into the monster meanings  and the back story! they nerf the creepy factor in silent hill 2 its going to fail so hard! so we want to make horror games less scary  now  when did we become so weak as a society
id only buy a  modern audience  turd if it had legendary word of mouth praise  aside from that they re off my shopping list
games used to be fun. can we get less fun remakes for a modern audience
sighs everytime I hear those words  I just....I cant throws hands up I ca.... nope
dead space remake looks to lit removing the scare factor of what lurks in the dark. now silent hill 2 remake scare factor is being made to appeal for the modern audience  Im sorry  but I like my games scary both visually and metaphorically! skipping this shyte!
wtf are they remaking it for.  also  you note  they  do not cut down on gore  just tension   scares. just think how great a horror could be just relying on tension   atmosphere. like they used to be.  not just 90 min in an abattoir  which are most  horror  today.
yeah I know they did modernize tomb raider but itstill was good but imagine modernized horror thatsounds horrible
well I want to call put a few things here  not with you but your statements boom.I think the first thing to note  is the gaming industries popularity took hollywood by storm. hollywood is haunted by the fact they are old money.this has lead to hollywood executives producers to seek moeny from an industry they entirely dont understand.on top of this is the  producer  fallacy were  we have of all things the investors calling the shots  instead of simply choosing to or not to invest in a game!control by these athorities has always lead them to not do actual research but go after trends  and worse non gamers as thier market.they all want to be the next call of duty  cal of dury only came out that way  trying to fallow suit in bungie and halo s multiplayer hype... normirs hate scifI and fantasy  so call of duty was appealing.in this structure we would love them to just make new games... the isue is is that executives in hollywood and most  investors  dont take risky investments... thus will use pre existing brands and tittles... even for new creative projects that have nothing to do with the ip.just insert x caracter  and a smater of setting off a wikipedia artical and you are good.erliest game  I have seen this done with was starfox adventure. were they said the game wasent going to cut it  and onsteed made it into a starfox ip game.... while the game at its core has nothing to so with starfox or railshooting. its just minimalized risks of brand recognition.risk is aomthing they will not take  even when there are obvius markets unfulfilled... they go for the popular trends that are overfilled every time.
there s always silent hill 2 enhanced edition. dont have to give money to people that hate you.
konamI can keep it. everyone wanted silent hills not a sh 2 remake. the moment they disrepected kojima  I was done with them.
at this point  I d prefer the original game  maybe with improved graphics  and just port it over to the current generation of consoles.
Im done with this woke  modern audiences  crowd...
for modern audience   so basically they will cut out nurses  and the whole element about james suppressing his sexuality because of his wife s condition. also  wouldn t be surprised if they make someone transgender  like pyramidhead.I had slimmer hope of this series reviving itself  but considering what huge fuck up were those  hd remaster  series  my hopes of this remake not being utter garbage are very slim  and this  updated for modern audience  isn t instilling any confidence either. just sell ip to capcom and move on konami.
repeat 6 55 excuse meeeee...
fuck konami. silent hill 2 is my favorite horror game of all time and I refuse to give this modern day take on an all time classic the time of day. gaming has become so vapid and empty thanks to corporate greed and mentality with no creativity and heart. I love the silent hill series  1-4 only  and would love to play silent hill 2 with insane graphical fidelity while keeping the core game and atmosphere. keep up the great work melonie!
I personally thought silent hill 2 wasn t thatscarey. for me it was the first game on ps1 that was scarey. I loved it all the same but God knows what the remake is gonna be like if they think its too scarey.  bloober team have made multiple horror games now and non of them are remotely scarey. their games are like ghost trains. they have a scarey theme but they arn t actally suposed to be scarey they are suposed to be fun and oh look a zombie yay hahaha oh whats round the corner eeww its slime coool so fun...........
... oh no...hello kitty...!
re2 must be one of the best true updated remake to date. modern audience  leave our games  movies and series alone!!!!if youre are not open-minded enough  too sensitive or focus on politics or are insecure  then please stay away.
look at those big toys!
horror  appealing  horror should horrify.that thrill of being creeped out and scared of a game thatshouldn t be able to threaten you but for some reason you cant shake the feeling that it is.and modern audiences are frailer than snowflakes.a manly man horrifies these goobers
I wasn t a fan of silent hill because I dont really go for the horror genre.  this does not make me more likely to want to play the game  though.
you know I almost didn t buy a ps5  because games are going the way of the movies
Im not really a big horror fan .... some things I like some I dont ... so I dont go out of my way to watch horror movies or play horror games. that is how I deal with the genre. I see no point in making a non scary horror game ..... Imean seriously wtf is the point  what s next cod with no shooting
yes  its obviously deliberate
r. i. p silent hill and res2 was kind of a love hate for me liked it for the most part but they got rid of eb mode and then when it came to doing the second set of scenarios a-b then c-d same bosses basically while as original they switched it up and res3 feels like they cut alot of good stuff out compared to the original version like the dude who first gets impaled by nemesis and I do miss the options along with mercenary mode.. but remember back in the day when people would make fun of a person who says anything on the lines of  im a gamer    we got made fun of called things now its okay and most people jumping on his band wagon  really make me laugh especially when playing some of these new remakes and acting like its  superior ... I really miss the old days lol
just another game to blacklist  because the  modern audience   is quite literally destroying everything they touch. how in the actual hell  does a 0.1  of the player base have this much power....
watch it bomb  the  journo  come out and call us names. same shit every time we gamers reject their so call  modern audience treatment of our believe classics
oh  one last thing.  the gaming industry has been hijacked by people who are not gamers for one simple reason  profit.  when I was a kid  video games were not the big phenom that they are today.  one big gaming event changed all that and that was the release of world of warcraft.  blizzard created an amazingly profitable mmo with wow.  after that  people outside the gaming industry showed up to get a part of that money pie.  do you think bobby kotick plays games   hell  no.  he s in it for the money.  so is ea.  so does activision.  does it matter if the games are any good   nope.  as long as they sell.  and that includes the people who own the tomb raider franchise.
dont pre-order it till we see the full game  preordering is a scam at this point
having recently watched someone play through a few of the silent hill games  the old ones did not play great even for the time. it was early 3d tank controls  bosses were just weird bullet sponges  you could easily miss key items if you didn t interact with the exact pixel required. they could honestly use an improvement in that aspect as well as graphics.
modern games are mostly fluff and no substance  for the most part  with a generous helping of identity politics.
layers of fear. u to pg levels of fear no doubt..terrifying.  not pg 13 mind  pg.
silent hill s remake is toast.  bland  unbuttered  overly cooked  stale  cold  blackened toast. the last holdout is resident evil. let s all just pray that the next sequel doesnt fall victim to the  modern audience  trend.
they want to compete with resident evil  good luck with that.
meanwhile  re4 remake is being made scarier than the original.  at least capcom knows we re not a bunch of pussies
how are you gonna keep a story  thats rooted in abuse  r@p3 and murder and make it less scary for a modern audience your suppose to feel uncomfortable. its suppose to bother you  they re human beings that have either been through or done some shit.you cant clean this one up  it ll lose its power if you touch it. this game and its characters are on a whole other level of self depraved people.let them waste their money remaking and ruining it  I ll save my money and play the originals. I dont need updated graphics and gameplay to enjoy a story people have enjoyed for 20 years
I can wait for the prison cut scene and see how badly they butcher it  there s one detail I no will fly right over there head  is how maria is sitting very lady like with her legs crossed and at the end where she stops switching from mary s to maria s personality to just her s she s sitting slumped with her legs wide open  you just no those hacks will miss the point of thatscene.https   www.youtube.com watch v rv3e8jmzds0
here s a thought  if you dont like a game just because its scarry  dont play it. play mario cart or something.
horror can be appealing or else why would anyone see it  horror is appealing because it horrifies
capcom did re2 and re3  mainly  dirty
bloober team literally made  the medium  which tries to rip off silent hill  but tells the exact opposite message. the game didn t need a remake  and was already dead when they announced it was bloober team
it looks more action oriented than the original though
@chandler burse  no it doesnt
@dantheman33088  yes it does leon has counter attacks and blocking now. yeah it may have potential to be scarier with the stealth mechanic now but they ve clearly also added to the action aspect
the abuse and r@p3 stories will either be watered down to not be there  to coddle the audience or be handled in typical bloober team fashion  actually the r@p3 was your fault angela!   either way they will utterly ruin it.
if I buy a terror game  I expect terror  are those people schizofrenic
the inevitable conclusion for generation snowflake. whenever the  souls games should have an easy mode  discussion came up  that used to be my argument. do you think scare games movies should have a non-scary mode version for sensitive audiences  I thought I was showing how ridiculous the notion was. today Im proven wrong.sh2 doesnt need a remake. just like its predecessor  it runs with the limitations of the hardware of the day. the characters look uncanny  sickly  the environments off  indistinct. all that plays in to the benefit of the game.but sure  they  get it .
the second I saw the dev team I dipped out  layers of fear is garbage.
the only curvy woman that the  modern audience  wants to see are women that have curves like those of a planet.
this game will be nothing more than a polished turd by the time it comes out.
noooooooooooo!!!! it cannot be!!!!!
not sure what youre rambling on about.  the re2 remake proved you could change the gameplay from the original and still put together an amazing game.  you running your own narrative.
follow kojima and play what he makes  not his previous employer
I recently played that game madison. scariest game Ive ever played. scarier than any silent hill game  although scary  and any resident evil game. this game freaked me out more than any movie Ive watched since the conjuring 1   2 and the 1st two insidious movies. so snowflakes beware. dont play madison. you ll need therapy. lol
there just re-releasing it for a new payday  but of course trying to get that esg score up by using buzzwords.
I kind of assumed the opposite. modern audiences are too desensitized  so we gonna up the horror to actually get to people.
I partially disagree  updating a game for a modern audience is exactly what we want  we just dont want that at the cost of what made the original game great in the first place.
gematsu  is a perfect place for info mel
great  save me money at not buying now
members of the original team silent have been saying for a while that how silent hill was originally presented wouldn t fly with today s gaming audience and it wouldn t- not if they want to generate enough income to justify making the games. modern audiences want more action  less build up  better mechanics  like no tank controls  and they re pretty against fixed camera angles.  konamI bloober are having to satisfy that crowd and original fans with score  themes  and story. bloober hasn t shied away from disturbing visuals and themes in any of their games so I highly doubt its getting the watered down woke treatment  adjusted for modern audiences  usually means- like everything from bloober and konamI strongly suggests they re updating what needs to be updated to catch up with how gamers have evolved. the gamers that actually spend money anyway.
you d be surprised how many games youremember as having great gameplay are actually pretty shit now  full of clunky frustrating elements that add nothing. nostalgia goggles. the trendy phrase these days is  quality of life . provided the changes are qol improvements   I see no reason for alarm.
I d rather just play the original game bro lmfaoo
kojima killed it with pt and I refuse to  let go of my ps4 with pt on it. silent hill is dead  and Im afraid of what konamI is gonna do to my metal gear solid remake. sniper wolf will probably be flat-chested  or decoy octopus will be trans
modern audiences   aka  participation trophies and safe spaces.
souls games genre are difficult games then  horror being the genre it makes sense not to add a non-scary mode because what would it be then  but if souls added an easy mode it wouldnt remove the entire enjoyment of the game especially for those who like playing on easy.but no we have to get thatstupid gatekeeping trend of  casual gamers dont belong  people need to get over themselves.
sh2 is basically dead on console without any remaster or remake they dont have the source code to properly remaster it again either.
@chandler burse  you  may need to see sfo video on gatekeeping
@it wasn t me  gatekeeping usually sucks is all I know. in gaming especially we dont solve problems as much as we cause them.
@chandler burse  yeah  the response of someone who s afraid his argument wont stand. great work buddy
@it wasn t me  .___.yeah because you are psychic I guess. can you also tell me what my ancestors said lol.
@chandler burse  let me check my crystal ball. ah  yes. they were deflecting when they could not defend their poor arguments.you know  sometimes staying silent makes you look the best.
@it wasn t me  staying silent makes you also think you were right.I dont think that was even on my mind. I just feel like being snarky sometimes.and a simple fact ive experienced myself as a gamer is that gatekeeping sucks as much as itsupposedly helps.
@chandler burse  and continue to talk just makes me sure.having said that  I apologise for being snarky as well. in truth  I will always prefer an actual discussion over this poo flinging.seriously  give sfo video a chance. he s a very reasonable dude and may give you a different perspective.
@it wasn t me  I dont even know who that is
@chandler burse  short fat otaku. look him up here on youtube
@it wasn t me  I apologize for the snark too but to be honest even if I did watch it I dont think I will suddenly think gatekeeping is amazing. I am a fan who has been criticized for playing games in a different order than veteran fans so no I dont like that gatekeeping.I dont like veteran fans who prefer the idea that the series is made only for them and that itshould die when they do lol.
@it wasn t me  yes I already did
@chandler burse  well  Ive been in gaming probably longer than you  probably longer than you ve been alive in fact.Ive seen how our hobby is progressively being destroyed because we did not gatekeep enough.we want other to enjoy our hobbies   but the problem comes when the newcomers start demanding more and more changes until the hobby is unrecognisable and the original community members are kicked out. now there s a new cast of gatekeepers.examples are too numerous to mention all. all of geek culture has been kidnapped. but a simple one  sexy armour as an option has been excised from gaming. why  how was that option preventing newcomers from enjoying the game  not that I use them  I dont even play as female if I can. but the removal  in principle  bothers me. and thats just a cosmetic thing  much more profound changes have been injected to kick us  veterans  out.gatekeeping is important for any healthy community  even countries. otherwise what you have is a suicidal community.if a  veteran  criticises you for whatever  does that really hinders the enjoyment of the game
@it wasn t me  sexy armor still seems rampantly common to me especially in online morpgs or whatever.
@it wasn t me  it hinders enjoyment of the community and makes one especially when young feel they dont belong.also veterans criticizing people for not doing it their way often results in newcomers seeing communities as toxic exposing them and trying to change things.cause and effect sometimes takes place I feel.and generally I think its just the truth the gaming community in general has a problem with elitism and other things.its full of messes even without wokeness.online gaming seeing it from my perspective of someone who never really could game with people online sometimes makes me glad I didnt.well at least glad I didnt get into fps shooter fad.
@it wasn t me  veterans oppositely have sought to kick newcomers out.gatekeeping done wrong or too obsessively is basically also a suicidal community.
@chandler burse  you started the argument by saying that an easy option in souls games should not hinder anyone s enjoyment. but the sexy armour option does  we may be playing different games as they are all but extinct in the ones I play.options are fine  until   newcomers  demand removals. here s a scenario  from software caves in and adds an easy mode. in 3 years newcomers demand thatshould be the default difficulty. in 3 more they want the hard mode removed because toxicity or some other bs. is that a ridiculous scenario  more than non-scary silent hill  I agree that excessive aggressive gatekeeping is bad. most of us  veterans  are fine with new people appreciating our hobby. what we dont appreciate is having it modified beyond recognition and having us kicked out.another easy  non gaming example. star wars. in 1978 it was as inclusive as it gets  I know I was there. today it has morphed into a rabid misandric feminist manifesto explicitly designed to be repugnant to people like me. so I ask  what s worse  a veteran mocking you or your hobby remade to explicitly  exclude you
I think we re agreeing that gatekeeping can be a bad thing.seems to me you feel the gatekeepers are worse winning and I see it the other way around. I think the  invaders  are worse and winning.and by invaders I dont mean just people wanting to join. Imean people wanting to infiltrate and subvert. thats what my examples were about
@it wasn t me  I dont think I said sexy armor does.I just said I dont see it being uncommon anymore than it has been.
@it wasn t me  whats worse is realizing that as I get older I am losing passion for nearly everything and that I quite frankly dont see a point in life if my beliefs are wrong.but thats a different topic
@it wasn t me  companies give in to changes because profit blame capitalism as well.
someone here already argued that kojima is woke and will put trans people in his games.just because I pointed out that arguably kojima has leftist things in his games such as the che guevara praise in peace walker.dont know what they are talking about
no way  modern audiences are the biggest pansies who dont like challenges
the remake trailer seems to still contain some of the more well disturbing elements
no   he really didn t.  it was a decent horror game demo   but it wasn t silent hill.
@palladiamors  yeah he really did  compared to the absolute shit they had released up to that point and the vision and starting point to reorientate the direction of the franchise  he really did. Imean  this news of them making the franchise  less scary  for audiences  is all the proof I need.
so  these  modern audiences  that mostly want a movie and not a game can watch the 13430 horror movies about grunge girls or killer clowns that come out every year but not play a horror game
signalis a good survival horror game
they added scares like a creature that has a gender preference  one where the creature dont like fat stuff  they also added a creature that eats meat instead of vegan. ohh and a creature that attacks you with gluten. those scare the modern audience.
if they update the ending from a dog to a cat for modern audiences I will be very disappointed
I loved the og silent hill 2. Im going to lose it if the remake sucks
nope I ll pass it up the moment it releases. Im sick and tired of these practices mechanics. sad part is that people fans will still buy it regardless of the changes. however for me I stand my ground if they change it Im out Im not going to buy your game s that a promise  percent. Im starting to see people ask about dino crisis remake I told them listen dont ever forget what happened to resident evil 3 remake. they cut corners on that game including resident evil 2 remake
people making these decisions should be fired
the  modern audience  is in california and doesnt resemble anyone who plays games or watches movies.
Im worried for gta 6. they dont seem to understand entertainment. they how to mess it up though.
the  audience thatsums up what s wrong. they dont want gamers  they want an audience for their cinematics. its merely an interactive movie.
the will remove the key elements like angela s r-ape story arc... or water it down to be unrecognizable...I fking hate modern devs
abandon all hope
what is  coach mac boot camp  I wonder
I still like to say aside from morrison in dmc v devil may cry fans won over capcom s stupid reboot decision.
good vid siski
oh shitsh2 will be woke as fuck  plenty of microtransaction and action game....
they better not f it up
nooooo  reeee  less scary. all I can reeeeeeee.
now we get curvy men and female blobs
2023 where the protagonist tell pyramid head and I quote    make love to me you beautiful inside mister killer because he is not understand
it will be a stuffed unicorn with a rainbow colored mane.
its bloober team  its going to suck
a nutrition plan Im working on for my friend lol
the series already had curvy men  have you seen vincent in sh3
for modern audience  if I wanted a game for pansies I d play a garden simulator.
updated for wimps. what s next  a metal gear solid remake where the terrorists just let you walk around as you please because the  modern audience  doesnt like stealth
reminds me of this   https   www.youtube.com watch v 20qvhpwhb3sits a parody vid mocking australia s censorship of the game when it came out.thankfully  its now uncensored.
the sole purpose of the horror genre is to scare your audience. why the fuck would you tone down the fear factor of one of the most legendary horror franchises of all time !
meh  im more excited for the resident evil 4 remake . but   I do feel silent hill 2 fan s pain. I just hope they dont do the same modern audience bs for the rumored metal gear solid remake.   which is also made by konamI  btw while we re on the subject of remakes  konamI   where are my contra remakes  I think the ps2 games are long overdue for remakes.
oh hell naaaaawwww
play the resident evil 4 remake lol
gaming  hijackedmovies   hijackedcomics   hijackedI hate this world.
so they re going to dumb down the sexuality that was in the game  the same sexuality that was one of the cornerstones of james  guilt... just cancel the f-ing game  please.
Im older than you and I cant play the silent hill franchise at all. even the original ps1. Im no snowflake  but I just cant do it! I love the movies  love the lore  watch the game play streams  but for some reason I just cant play the games because they scare the crap out of me!
just play the original. trust me  they already screwed up the remake before this modern audience thing was announced. silent hill 2 has a very deep story with layers of subtext and symbolism. well all thatsymbolism is gone from what you see in the trailers cause team bloober is stupid and doesnt understand silent hill 2.
modern audience
aaaaand my hype is gone..
off subject  is lara croft and the guardian of light good
how about adjusting games for a  normal audience  .... .. . . . .
modern audience....they are after the fortnite money.
...not-so silent hill...
does the word genre means nothing anymore  like if its tagged as horror wtf you expected  flower and rainbows
they ll tone down the oversexed monsters and if you know anything about the story was the whole damn point of them.
not everything is horrible. I thought resident evil village was pretty good. we also got elden ring  a game with no easy mode. we can only hope that there are still some slivers of light in the darkness.
@eyes of ascension  both games from japan.  I know not everything is horrible I was speaking in hyperbole.
its alright. good  not great.
@melonie mac go boom  thanks for reply. good not great  perfect description. got it last night for a new co op game. we played it. its good to kill time.
hope this is just a joke
just like music one has to go outside of the top 40 to get to the genuinely creative music   so too with video games today sadly.
take the scares out of a scary game  I dont see this backfiring at all. give whoever suggested this a promotion
devs doing crap like this  is why I dont get new games  or remakes. they are more worried about making games for fat blue hairs  that dont even play games at all. they only care about spreading   the message   not making good games anymore.
pleased I still own the ps2 game and console  I can see how this game is going to be destroyed from a million miles away and will be nothing like the original game  sad times so I ll play the og game.
commenting to feed the algorithm
d.o.a.
Im soooo sick and tired of survival horror scary factor being watered down all because of a bunch of snowflakes cant handle being horrified
people who aren t interested in something aren t going to be just because you try to  adapt for a new audience . silent hill didn t do well to begin with for the original fans  what makes them think this is better
time to dust off the old consoles and crank up the emulators
silent hill wasn t thatscary in the first place. now they want to more water it down
this woman has been recommended to me the past couple of days... I refuse to watch because based off the thumbnail shes my type! haha seems chill though
now pyramid head didn t carry a large knife  he just dead names and uses non inclusive language.
modern audience  makes me want to vomit  I ll be ripping itso I hope their  modern audience  has money.
with youtube new rules about violence will be able to make money so yeah its going to be hard to live stream
for a modern audience are my  trigger words  Im out
....a... less scary...silent....hill...hhhmmmm uh....the goat duck simulator !
what surprise...another ip given to a female lead  insert title  is now being marketed to  a modern audience .where have I seen this before
gamers are some of the most mindless consumers too  so you know its going to sell well anyway.
ugh..... there s no words. another game doa.  yep remakes the point is lost. now its a about changing them to fit modern audiences more than its about brining the game and all its glory to modern graphics engine.theve been doing the same with movies. I ll be honest   I think its being pushed from somewhere higher up at this point. Imean wtf.
there is no modern audience  its the original damn audience of the original damn material  and also all the new audience of the original material. you want to make something for a  modern audience  make something new. the entertainment industry isn t making anything new  they are just exploiting old material without actually understanding why people like it  in order to push the message and then try to shame people into liking it.
common kojima l
updated for modern audiences     we want to throw money away and lose our jobs as creators when the game tanks.  fine. get it over with so actual creators can come in do something good.
wont be preordering this one
reeks of sony meddling.
think more positively!!!!
well I will say that resident evil 2 and 3 remakes had great gameplay along with graphics and story  but yeah they need to stop diversifying things to appease newbies who just wanna fit in. I remember when I was a kid  liking video games was still a very closeted thing. anyways this society is so soft its not even funny
I wasn t looking forward to this remake because I played the original game so many times. I want something new. I watched the preview of this game and almost fell asleep  do you know how many times Ive seen that intro of him looking in the mirror  can we get something new
they are making this game for the people who dont play video games. when are they ever going to learn  what good is a horror game if youre not shitting yourself when the sirens go off. lol
you want to make horror less scarry ! come on! what s next. action less actiuony! now- I really afraid of horrors. I am grown up above 20 but playing fnaf before sleeping will teriify me. so I just... dont do this  not all games needed to be for all! thats why generes exist! I adore vn while some people hate them. thats okay.
yeah  the  modern audience  trope is completely played out  regardless of context. they got silent hill 2 right the first time around  so if I wanna play that  I can just fire up my ps2. people can call me boomer or whatever  but we got better stuff.
if you dont like scary movies or video games dont play or watch them its as simple as that.
check out my book!
silent hill 2 remake   ebola aids
did the jap developer say this  if so thats not woke. japs have always been censor heavy on video game violence.
...everything s gone commercial...everything s for a buck...
personally I want sh1 remake  but ffs  modern audience  needs to die.
f that damn phrase. silent hill is one of my most favorite ip regarding games. let the shitposting and memes begin.  freethefridgekitty
why would you make a horror game if you dont want to make itscary wtf silent hill was always scary or tried at least
people want scary.
so funny nobody sees this.
unfortunately even ports aren t safe look at mass effect legendary edition and gta definitive edition
I ll just stick with my original thanks.  if they remove the camera angles  the uncanny valley graphics  the slightly unnatural voice performances  the implied sexual violence  then all you have left is a generic action game like any of the resident evil remakes.
idk this may be an over reaction
why bother  might as well really go for it with puppies   rainbows.
just play moded silent hill 2 called enhanced edition. forget about the remake. it was dead they said it was made by the polish developers
doa
nooooo not silent hill 2 dam this modern audience
nooooooo!!!!
esg scores ruined everything. every company is dead. we need to get rid of this.
modern-wussy
I am  a Christian.....just got bacxk
the state of gaming is truly frustrating this is such a f - you to long time fans
the next gen resident evil will be void of zombies and guns
...making scare factors more appealing to the contemporary audience   its supposed to be scary!!! why would anyone want to make it more appealing      splendid... whats next ha  a fearless f.e.a.r. remake  rename it f.u.n. while youre at it...
stick with older games  and older movies.remember  hollywood takes 3-7 years to create a movie  from story to finished product  so any feedback they are getting today  is not going to show up until 2030.
well fuck that xd
noooooo less scary
updated for a modren audience  what s the point of it being a horror game then
Ive lost interest in the witcher remake too wont buy it all my friends wont be buying it that goes for sh2 too
remakes went from being remakes  and maybe it was always going to be a slow bait n  switch  to being revisions. its classic marxism when it takes hold of culture.
they ve already done non zombie games
hyperbole to point out the destruction of video game canon
this 100
love you
what do you mean less scary  the first one was not thatscary. if anything itshould be nore scary
why why  are we letting these loons ruin our favorite things in games!!!!
silent hill 2 was the most emotionally draining game  it messes with your mind  of course they will make it woke and soft. the main character will probably be gay or trans
this is what the right used to do right ..............mmmm
just a question. when did american society get so pussified
nah I ll pass.  silent hill f is the only one I still have hope for.
another game I now have no interest in getting now.
are they posting pictures of trump in scary and dark places
I knew bloober was a mistake they cant make a horror game or a good game for that matterthe medium was absolute trash.
im not seeing the issue. the originals gameplay is extremely outdated. and a over the shoulder camera works great for survival horror. also the game isnt really scary. the fear comes from the atmosphere. as long as they nail that itll be alright.
no offence but at least I can play it now
is anything safe anymore!!
are you kidding
shouldve remade silent hill not the sequelthis is just a cash graband by the sound of this news they are gonna screw it up
there nothing they can woke up in silent hill im not worried.u cant change a story thats literally about a man finding his wife and thank God he s not searching for his husband lmao...do u want play q game with 2002 gameplay mel
silent hill 2 has been the top spot in so many  scariest game ever  lists and they re trying to fuck with that  fuck.
ok now its clear that this channel is pure clickbait
lol
they re going to make every character black and gay!
uuuuuuuuuuughhhhhhhhh nooooo  why
melonie  honestly Im scared  this woke bs has gone way to far. Imean now we have menstruating  people  when only women menstruate  everything in gaming is racist  and now a pregnant joker. wtf is happening...
at this point they should ve just let silent hill die  this just pisses me off and dulls my excitement for the new game
again!  my gosh I cannot stand it alllll these great games of the past are getting destroyed. Im running out of games as a gamer   I literally have to replay games which is great but damn I want to experience new ones that I haven t played for years. damn liberals always ruin everything for everyone literally. if they dont like it no one can what happened to just not buying it.
rip silent hill long before it drops  how many years are gonna pass before I can get some good games    we got re4 remake.  is anything else not woke
yeah woke had destroyed everything movies  tv  .games  everything
welp.....I wont buy it because of it being less scary. remakes should be faithful when it comes to story and gameplay and new stuff is always welcome so long as the stuff suits the game. we need to start gatekeeping  we were fools to not do that. your poor sad   disappointed face in the thumbnail  we gotta turn that frown upside down.
well ain t that a load of shit. guess I gotta torrent the original now
welcome to soy-lent hill. tourists spoil everything.
nope!
less scary   bro just play a barbie game or some shit lol
ok the new camera view is great. hate locked camera views
well I wont be buying or playing this.
God  I wish they would stop doing this shit. why cant they just do a 1 1 with updated graphics.
I aam in an intrvie
make it less scary  its not really that horrifying in the first place.
yeah best advertisement ever I wont be getting the game then Im glad capcom is still good I hope they stay same
I hope they keep the nurses .... they may think they are sexist
Im so sick of this crap when will it end mel
not kiool
silent hill is actively a woke series it always has been what are you on
if  your not sngle I am green beret
alr bye
they had to bc its a sony exclusive now.  ponies are fragile
no dont tell me that... I was so stoked for a silent hill remake! fuck all this apparent  modern audiences  that are so sensitive that a horror game has to be turned down to accommodate them  does the pre order version come with a dummy pacifier  too!  or maybe they are doing marketing xp boosts inside each pack of captain crunch. im done with this  modern audience  world.
game is dead on arrival
the most contradictory article title.
who is this non existent audience they are pandering to
never found silent hill scary.  but if you have to dumb it down  thats pathetic.
are you kidding me. sick of all the cats!
Jesus Christ now they butcher the masterpiece sh2  oh lol
why do you keep using the no true scotsman fallacy.
bloober team is just terrible. their games are terrible walking sims  their stories are terrible  they lack the skill to deal with heavy topics in a delicate and intriguing way  especially compared to asian horror  and it makes sense that they double down on the  modern audience  trend since their character are just as obnoxious as modern snowflakes
silent hill pg13 cuts away modern audiance have enogh fantasy to see not shown gore. I wonder when the m3gan games come. you play a 12 year girl and fight an robot girl  at the end of a buch of finalgight level.
dude cmon why do we keep doing this garbage.
this is such a ridiculous take. this game isn t even out yet. we ve seen a few minutes of footage from a trailer. there s nothing to see here except more reactionary rage farming.
hello there
remake games always suck. youre better off playing the magnificent old games. silent hill 1-4 dont need remakes anyway. the only remake that looks good is final fantasy 7  and it needed it  but they changed the gameplay. old james looks cooler than the remake james. new james looks constipated.
what an overreaction  as we can see by the remake trailer the scene of pyramid head se     abusing the female mannequins was left in the game and even the nurses got buffed cleavege as seen in the steam screenshots. btw of course they are modernizing the scares when the original silent hill 2 has a 90s tank controls and cameras
bloober team sucks big time!
I played God of war ragnarok . it was definitely made for a  modern audience .. super easy  tons of handholding and some woke and feminist elements thrown in. very disappointing
the same audiences that film studios pander to that dont even buy tickets to see their movies.
people here clearly havent even seen the damn trailer or scene shots as they go on about how its not gonna have the sexual themes yet the mannequin scene and nurses design are still consistent in the trailer.
God of war 2018 was just as easy as ragnarok though
you people are overreacting God of war ragnarok was not woke or at least overtly.literally the game did not force heavy messages about racism and feminism down your throat. it didnt make kratos emasculated it didnt make freya completely right in her hate towards kratos.it didnt have angrboda bring up race or anything.and whatever it did bring up was probably a message in the previous games such as anti-revenge and a development of the character of kratos or a dealing with fate something gow2 dealt with as well.
silent hill 2 is definitely a woke game  and sh3 even has feminist elements too
the legend of zelda and cyberpunk are the last to hopes I have for gaming  anymore.
well another  woke edition    and this time a remake of a classic game. funny  I thought the polish didn t care about these things
the woke gaymakes.
nooo gameplay needs an overhaul. og silent hill games move too slow. sh never was thatscary it was more unnerving and unsettling if anything
what s the fucking point of making a horror game then  if its not scary
its a slippery slope and you cant even enjoy the ride on the way down its way too stupid
wow Im glad its skipping xbox now lol at first I was mad but now Im not I will stick with the old silent hill
well of course  they re not going to make a scene by scene remake  they will change and update stuff. the game is like 20 years old. what is surprising about this
Im glad the resident evil games ain t dealing with this bs.
who wants a horror game that isn t scary lol. defeats the purpose of it. at this rate a tellytubbies game will be in the same class has horror games now. humanity is pathetic lol.
lara croft was not ruined that much the trilogy was still good was silent hill a modernized treatment lol
why the hell do you play a horror game but to be scared   thats why I dont play horror games.  I dont like being scared.  I dont want to be included  leave scary games scary for the people who like them  I have other games I can play.  not every game should be for everyone.  thats how you get boring copy-paste homogeneity.  screw homogeneity.
convert to modern audiences.    hmmmm what scares modern audiences     no diversity  aaahhhhhh.  a woman in the kitchen   aaahhhhhh.  no prom aaaaaahhhhhhh!  scariest game ever.   give me a break.
huh  first we had sjws and now we have whatever the hell this video is-both are equally annoying to the point of parody.Ive never seen an overreaction to two words.
you know you could just not cover this story right
its only skipping xbox for a year
@chandler burse  its skipping xbox its going to pc
@chandler burse  lake final fantasy 7
@nate joe  no its on pc when it releases but the ps5 exclusive is a year temporary thing
@chandler burse  okay
@chandler burse  thats what they said with final fantasy 7 and its still not on xbox
@chandler burse  I will take your word for now thatsilent hill is coming to xbox because Im not 100  sure but I have a feeling that its not
@chandler burse  and I could be wrong and you could be right but I just have a feeling that its not
isn t silent hill actively a woke series anyway lmao
you know you could just not watch my videos right
@dragon ball fans cant read youre doing a terrible job.
@dragon ball fans cant read  im not a simp I dont like her takes or her audience read the comments here and you ll see me arguing a lot to eb fair
@dragon ball fans cant read  so why do you even say anything  why even come here if your not gonna even watch it  I dont watch her vids either but I dont speak about their content in the comments I argue with the commenters points.
@dragon ball fans cant read  if you dont want to support her just dont come here her point still stands your not making a good argument at all. and I remind you I dont even agree with her video titles either since I feel people assume before even knowing when it comes to gaming as much as actual issues with wokeness or whatever occur.
@dragon ball fans cant read  also I said youre doing a terrible job of exposing her all you done is argue with her for a short sec on a comment. you making your own video or something lol not giving her ad money isnt the same as exposing her.
@dragon ball fans cant read  youre not doing any exposing though lol.youre just fighting in a comment
@dragonballfanscantread2383 then dont watch her content then do not comment here.your little comment here you are just causing nothing but drama and your opinions dont make sense at all.
@chandler burse  Ive already shown thatshe has lied about disliking the tomb raider reboot trilogy.its already been proven thatshe lied about her stalker for attention.
@the unsolved wizard  freedom of speech.
@dragon ball fans cant read  I dont see any comment proving either of those here or anything on your channel.I guess you argued on the other videos eh
@chandler burse  he s just saying bunch of bs he is literally calling melonie mac out.I feel like he is just clout chasing being a clown and trying to draw attention even tho he has no proof whatsoever.
@the unsolved wizard  Imean I dont like the whole attention seeker thing either but to be fair I dont really care if he s calling her out if he has substantial claims at least.I am not a fan myself.or really a fan of any conservative based youtuber . or liberal either.
@chandler burse  Im more of a independent person I just dont like when people call out on others for no reason I know its todays society I subscribe to malonie mac because of tomb raider only Im not a big fan of politics tho most crap I stay out of.
