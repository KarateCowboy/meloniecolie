even jury members were saying she lost almost all credibility after she didn t follow through on the donations she promised. that may have been the last straw for dc  as they cant afford more bad publicity. cant imagine ezra miller has any more chances left either.
her being cut would be the only way I d watch it. I never cared about a marriage I considered toxic and probably the result of a mid-life crisis  but it really irritated me how they dog piled on depp simply b c he s male. and now its clear he was the abused partner. I dont like bullies and this woman has a track record of abusing her partners. Im glad karma bite her in the end!
amber heard is the reason why I haven t even seen the first aquaman  its finally nice to see her bad behavior then brought more into the light. now if you excuse me I need to go watch her in zombieland  her acting in the second half of her scene was so heartfelt and true to her nature its breathtaking.
Im 100  in the same frame of mind. I didn t mind aquaman 1  enough to go watch aquaman 2 for myself. but I definitely wont be buying a ticket until I can confirm she isn t in it. if she is  then its all that much easier to go get a ticket to something else instead!
my vote goes to recasting w  emilia clarke. Ive seen people photoshop her face over amber s in screen shots of the 1st movie and we know that her and momoa work well together.
I didn t grow up necessarily with God of war  but to your point  I love what they did with the 2018 version. it wasn t the same ole testosterone fueled kratos filled with uncontrollable rage. we got to see a completely different side of kratos with a sweet beard to show his aging and we also saw that the testosterone fueled rage was still there when it had to be. if youre gonna continue making sequels you cant just rehash the same thing over and over.
Im fine with sf6 having different outfits  as long as they kept the main essence of the characters. Imean spiderman and ironman have gone through multiple different designs but they are still themselves. I think its good when your favourite band tries something different. sometimes.
I thought the first aquaman was great for what it was. aquaman 2 sounds like it would be a great watch regardless of whether heard is in or not. in the meantime  Im staying clear of news - or rather narrative emitted whine signalling.also  I agree that they could recast a key character - its not like it d be the first time they ve done that  e.g. the oracle in the matrix revolutions  love it or hate it
I loved street fighter 2 ever since it came out    Im very much attached to ken and ryu  though I certainly have a significant attachment to the original sf2 cast   on the subject of aging the characters appropriately - ash ketchum is still 10 years old  after over 20 years!    o
personally  I d love it if they brought in a new actress  and made like fresh prince of bel-air did back in the day.  yknow mera...ever since you had that baby...somethings different about you.  then jason mamoa could give an awkward look into the camera.
I think wb assumed everything was just rumor until it all played out in court  or at least had deniability till the show trial.
I reckon it would unironically make more money if they did the suggestion in a twitter meme where they replace her entire character with bruce campbell  extra points if its literally the exact same character  with the red hair and mermaid-scaley suit  name and character role  but its just bruce campbell playing the character
warner bros and dc should of done this from the start but better late then never.
I was surprised by the first aquaman  even though im a huge punisher fan. I think they should just recast her role  Imean  there are plenty of good actresses can fill her shoes.
Im still more hesitant to watch the second one because it always seems like once the first movie gets their foot in the door  they try less to make the movie good and try more to preach at their audience. I hope Im wrong  but I ll be waiting for reviews... and possibly blu ray cause finding a babysitter you trust is hard lol
the game looks to have a create a fighter as the main story. well looks like melonie is going to create a fighter. lara craft in street fighter confirm. but than what special moves would you give her  acrobatic moves is the only thing I canthink of. unless the game allows two pistols. than yeah you give her that.
to be honest  I liked heard in the first aquaman film  she was great eye candy.
if she is in it  I will watch it but in the cheapest way possible and in no rush....but  if she is gone  I will go see it on the big screen.
melonie sees ken is divorced melonie- street fighter has a divorcee now I feel represented lmfaoo
if she s not in it I ll watch it
here here!
Im with ya! you know  I bought that dvd and haven t even unwrapped it yet simply b c I found out she was in it! lol
@raggmopp 3377  zombieland  or aquaman
@downskated  aquaman
I didnt knew she was in it. first one   what part
same here and my wife feels the same way. I actually liked the first movie because I like the whole indiana jones feel it had. I wont watch  2 unless amber is totally removed from it. I know she still got paid from it but removing her from the movie would be enough for me.
that was damn funny. bring on the bruce!
rofl
thanks for sharing that Bible verse of the day
Im quite positive there has been some really good movies thatsold well  had awards given etc... and yet still had garbage actors and actresses.  we just didn t know because social media wasn t around to highlight them. ignorance is bliss. as they say. I wouldn t care if amber retained her part in the movie  not the best actress but I hate it more when they change people and play it off as the same person. or kill them off for no good reason.
I would wait for conformation cause this is a rumor I say wait and see if she is I ll watch it too maybe
the first street fighter came out in 1987. I think changing the original characters in any way deviates from the original series  doesnt matter if its not woke or woke either way its technically not original.
hey melonie I am sooooo happy thatshe will not be on the new aqua man 2 movie. anyway now thatshe is not on it anymore that I will definitely be watching it in theaters and on hbo max if it does come on hbo max  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and let you know that I am so truly happy thatshe is not in the new aqua man 2 movie anymore  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
Im not one to act out of spite. I do like to see people getting salty for no good reason  twitter   but I usually dont go out of my way just to  piss off  someone. but boy  I am considering watching aquaman 2 now  and I didn t even watch the first!
the age comments have to feel good! drinker s reaction was the best tho. meat-based ftw
updated title should be aquaman and the lost turd.
regarding the comment about ken being divorced and whether it makes the game woke. if anything its the opposite. she took his kid and left him with nothing. sounds a bit red-pilled.
will aquaman say he wants out if she s cut
1 53 the only thing that would get me to watch it in thearters is if they replaced amber with gura  shy of that ill rent it on a home release  that is better than my prior when its on hbo for free stance
they didn t recast heard  because they feared a twatter backlash. I dont think her career will take a nose dive though. she s going to be put on a pedestal and employed by the wokest studios and supporting female directors.
this is bitter sweet to me. while I agree that amber should be cut out of the film itstill saddens me as a fan of the mera character. amber should have been removed. they should have recasted for mera and done re-shoots. I wish the film would be delayed and this would happen. I ll see the movie now. but I cant agree with them removing the mera character either. that would suck big time.
mashing x to doubt  there s no way youre that old.also Im a cammy main
do you have a video that goes more in depth into the carnivore diet  Im interested in starting it but want to do it right
melonie  I d like to elaborate on the verse of the days because as you mentioned this verse can hit like a brick wall and can leave you feeling convicted by the spirit. as stated  our bodies are God s temple  this is a cornerstone belief for those born again because the new heart given by God compels us to overcome our sins that our old heart and flesh crave. sin by its nature exempts us from being able to physically be with God because it is defilement  think adam and eve. as born again believers  we must consume God s word to enable ourselves to be indwelt by the holy spiritso that we can be close with him again while we live on this earth. in contrast to God indwelling you as something given freely  evil spirits take possession of someone body often without consent as if to mock God s gift of grace. keep the faith and God bless you and your viewers.
ryu and blanka were my characters.
people are afraid because they see every day  the woke culture walk a step forward and the normal culture walk a step back. unfortunatelly  this process is irreversible. the future will be woke. but  do not dispair. we will be aways in good company of our robocops  our terminator 1 and 2  the true ones   our music from the 90 s  and God watching over us. keep the faith  the body perish but the soul is eternal.  I think its strange how the wokes never attacked wwf.
not even with her being gone I will watch this movie I refuse to give any money to wb dc with what they re doing to my favorite heroes  comics and how they continue to hire staff who constantly disrespect fans and the fact they hired the guy who disrespected 911 first responders
I would agree if it were a remaster  remake  but as a new game that is aging the characters up it makes sense that they would wear different clothes. we all change our clothes and even style to some degree.
I do on my melonie mac channel called  how I did it.  I suggest watching dr ken berry here on youtube as well  tons of carnivore info
@melonie mac go boom  ok thank you  I ll check those out
the amber store is now open for business  https   youtu.be mimgypwjwgs
final fight character poison isn t woke. she is a trans. but unlike the woke. they made her base on an actual plot of a game. that made sense. capcom couldn t put women in the game a guy beating up women in the 90 s. because the game wouldn t be release. they made two types a gay character and a trans. they went with the trans. when the fcc ask  capcom said those are not women  they are trans. just to find a loop over the law. thanks to mortal kombat all that is remove. but they left poison being trans. people this is before woke trying to be political on video games.
I really enjoyed aquaman. I didnt follow the court cases and will disassociate it from the show as both heard and depp are just crazy ppl in general with thier own problems. I hate the whole death by child birth shit though. just replace the actress! mera is a great character. dont cut mera out.
I say they recast mera  get adrianne palickI  commander grayson on the orville  for the role.
I d watch a movie starring amber where she plays a manipulative sociopath and marries a hollywood a-lister and destroys his career because he forgot her birthday or some shit.
nope. still not going to watch it. warner bros eliminating heard from the movie doesnt mean they deserve forgiveness. they still backed her  they re still woke as fuck  they still lied. y all need to break your addiction and show some principles and spine. warner bros is simply trying to hypocritically chase the dollar. they re not sorry for their actions  nor is this an indication of them changing their stance. they chose heard s side because they thought it would be profitable. now its not  and they re desperately backpedaling. its a desperation move  and if you support aquaman 2  all you ll be doing is telling them their behavior is just fine. let these woke companies die. you dont need them  they need you.
amber heards only chance now is straight up pron or an onlyfans account.
early gang go boom! good to see ya mel!
I really want to see the aquaman but I will not if amber heard is in it  I agree they should just recast with amelia clarke.
yeah Imight watch aqua man 2  amber heard is a bad person good content melonie
hImelonie I hope you had really niceweekend
does she get to keep the 2 mil paid to her for the role
I ll only watch it if bruce campbell is cast as mera.
its a shame thatshe got cut from the film. johnny depp needs paying somehow...
well..there is chick-fil-a.
happy monday mel!
need rowan atkinson as maera
its cheaper to cut than recast...
frankly they should go back and use cgI to remove her from the first movie as well  she kinda ruined it for me now.
the problem is she still gets paid  cut ot not...
I wish disney was like that then they would fire brie larson
Imean  considering how much she lied...yeah.bring in bruce campbell!  d
captain jack sparrow will never be caught !!!
thanks!
where are boo and pistol  did her dad put them in dog fights
hello miss macdid you see the small outrage a  random twitter user  had over the small mexican girl in the roster crying  cultural appropiaton  becauae she had small native american  feathers orament  on her hairthen he said  Ive never played street fighter before  I was planking my head on the floor making a face-planet
I ll just wait for the high seas. warner bros should be reinstating johnny  not cancelling amber. in any case wb is still one of the worst companies out there.
amen sister
boom!!!
if true I ll go see it iike jason mamoa.
I dont know. roman polanskI did a lot worse but hollywood backed him up until pretty recently.

I dont like how this being approached because this is the equivalent of her getting  cancelled . and I was hoping we would turn the other cheek  since the law has spoken. but suits be suits  I guess...
frankie go boom
serves her right for now she completely destroyed johnny depp s career and he s the reason why she got the job to begin with. I personally wasn t going to watch this film if she was still in it. lol
if she is cut I wonder if she still gets paid  she  has already did the parts so ill bet she can get her money or most of it..which sucks cause id like her to get nothing..I wanna see her homeless  pushing a shopping cart on skid row as soon as possible..I hate her..so glad she lost the case..her lawyer elain is now on my most hated list too..she wont shut up even know she lost...
amber
I dont know what I think of this. I hate cancel culture no matter who s being cancelled. Im not ok with destroying peoples careers even really bad people. Imean she s utter poison now in hollywood and she ll never work again ! I just want the aquaman 2 movie to be good but if they cut too many scenes just for amber will it hurt the story   I cant see that they will re-shoot with another actress. I bet jason momoa says no to that. he s not going to want to go back for that reason. so if they write her out as died in childbirth then will it wreck the current script   I just want good movies I dont want revenge on amber heard thats not going to get me anything in my life and it wont in the rest of you all either.
awesome now Imight watch it as well because she s a crappy person and thats being polite
commenting to feed the algorithm
pulling violent abusers from movies is a lot different than cancel culture lol
@melonie mac go boom  fair enough.
personally I think she was just a mediocre actress to begin with so if she gets cut entirely the worst that can happen is that the movie doesnt get any worse. who knows  it might make it better.
amber out!!!
ur turning 36 if my gf eats enithing other than raw meat im pulling out the belt
hey mel!
unpopular opinion  I would hate this. I hate amber heard but I like the character mera and I dont want the character to be shafted because the actress is horrible. plus usually people talk about separating art from the artist.
@melonie mac go boom      butt physics
amber turd

good news what the f is wrong with u for being happy cutting some one from movie
relace amber with melonie mac. short  ripped figure with massive tattoos  from the aquatic mouse kingdom  playing spunky rey-like mary sue.
woman accuses man of dv. woman instantly believed and man loses opportunities.man accuses woman of dv  needs to have mountains of evidence and a successful trial before she loses opportunities.
hey melanie I noticed that you have tattoos I wanted to tell you that I love yr tattoos and I subscribed to yr channel and I am embarrassed to say this but I think yr sexy hot and cute melanie
eh  I think personal life stuff shouldn t effect your career. this is just cancel culture.
I honestly would not care if an actor killed someone and was found guilty. if I enjoy their acting  I will watch them act. I am in no position to judge their personal choices.
aquaman is a dumb character  who are we kidding. he controls water
Im not short lol. taller than the average woman in the us at least
so violent criminals shouldn t have their careers affected...  I get it with cancel culture  but there s a difference between cancelling someone over their politics vs them violently cutting people s body parts off
so Im guessing you ll be watching rust then lmao
