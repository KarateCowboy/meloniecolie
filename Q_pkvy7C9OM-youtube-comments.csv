the other day I saw the page from the original she hulk comics where jen tells bruce thatshe doesnt hate him for what he did to her  thatshe in fact loves him for it. why on earth couldnt we have gone that way with this show  why does everything have to be so bitter and toxic
she-hulk writers  she s a strong independent woman that dont need no man. also she-hulk writers  let s get her to twerk with megan thee stallion and treat men like a piece of meat.
how dare you objectify your partner and not get affirmative consent!  wait  your partner is a man   nevermind  thats fine.
after watching the director s interviews  I can see why this show is so toxic. she seems bitter  angry  and even mentions having friends that will help you bury a man.
she hulk basically catfished the guy.
she hulk is just dumb. theres s a lot of cringe ments even though I dont think they ment for them to be cringe. there s also a lot of hypocrisy and double standard when it comes to how the men and women act towards one another. I liked how you pointed out actual funny movies with women. the constent man bashing or soy boy part s do get old...fast. you are spot on about what she hulk did to that guy  good video melonie.
Im fine with movies like the accused and in the company of men as they are specifically about bad male behaviour  when its forced and preachy and wagging the finger at all men its petty and lazy.
if the she-hulk writers didn t have double standards  they d have none.
yeah  I knew I wasn t the only one who noticed hypocrisy. especially when the dude who called jen sexy is portrayed to be an asshole  but its supposed to be funny when she says that it matters if a guy is hot.
thanks for suffering   watching this garbage again. also thanks for your intelligent  balanced    entertaining review as usual.  keep it up!
melonie suffers through itso we dont have to. we thank you for your sacrifice
seeing a man on-screen in this show always sets me on edge because I wonder how he s going to be portrayed as a straw man for the patriarchy. it was such a relief when jen s dad came around in episode 4 and showed genuine concern for her safety.
cant be accused of double standards if you dont have any standards  -twitter mob
this is more than just a show reflecting current culture...these writers must have shallow  hollow lives.you got to 30k during the last fnt  here s to 40k tonight!
no wonder the mcu oh Im sorry the m-she-u is rotting from the inside out
almost like when a woman lays on thick layers of makeup  hairspray   etc.  takes a picture and post it on their profile. they go on a date and the guy finds out that is not what she looks like and is mad at him for her deception.
it really is crazy how they show you in this series the blatant hypocrisy coming from our mainstream culture today... I would say  I really appreciate having someone like you that is willing to watch this woke  entertainment  garbage and give honest commentary along with your own intelligent perspective that I quite enjoy  and certainly agree with... buuuut if I dare say that I would be a weak  stupid  beta-male... on the other hand if I dared to say something honest like I am glad I found your channel because I find it much easier to enjoy content from a beautiful woman thatseems like a really cool and chill person that I would actually enjoy having a conversation with  as opposed to a blue haired they them that would likely make a video and talk about how this show is such a great tool to show men today an accurate representation of a strong woman fighting the patriarchy  and saying all of the quiet parts of what life is like as a woman  out loud... lol well if I said that then I would of course be a creep that is something akin to the physical embodiment of toxic masculinity and my intention of giving you a compliment would instead be a digital  cat call  or something.
you are absolutely right  it is the hypocrisy that is unbearable.. Imean the show is not remotely fun imo. but thats a matter of taste I guess  but the hypocrisy is there no matter what you enjoy.. and if you cant admit that that is the case  well then.. I guess thats where the real problem lies..
this show has single handedly proven everything these so called  bigoted men  have been saying all along
I hate thatshe-hulk has 0 femininity.-no make-up.-nails not painted.-awful fashion sense.
its a reflection of the people making the show  this is how they handle the world around them
because these people are nihilistic and miserable.
where did she say she hated him
its literally all they know
@deonte carlisle  nobody is asserting jen said she hated bruce either in the video or the comment section here. in the comics she specifically stated she loves being she-hulk and thanked bruce  who felt guilty. she doesnt do that here  but that doesnt mean anyone is saying jen hates bruce. the reason why is because the show changed the origin to where bruce didn t deliberately save her life by giving her a blood transfusion using his blood  as this occurred by accident here. so there s not even the dynamic of blaming bruce for this in the show.
couple of things. that wasn t from a she hulk comic. that was likely from a hulk comic but it definitely wasn t from a she hulk comic speaking as someone who has read them all.next that moment is taken wildly out of context. jen isn t immediately in love with she hulk. this moment comes after several issues and over a year of character progression. last its important to note in that page jen claims she is no longer a victim meaning she used to think of herself in that way. so taking all this into consideration mcu jen just hasn t gotten to the point that comic jen has. moreover the context of her getting her powers and her progression are different
@joseph bapeck  I dont know if youre responding to me or david  because youtube s comment system isn t that good  but as someone who read the she-hulk comics and nearly every one of her appearances up to the 90s when the comic industry crashed  and that happened in one of the incredible hulk comics. I gave all mine away years ago so I dont recall exactly everything  but she felt like a victim as jen walters  and not as she-hulk. she didn t have quite the same multiple personality thing that bruce did  after her savage she-hulk run. the multiple personalities thing went off the rails after the peter david run  but none of the hulks had anything like did but jen had two variations of the same personality in the comics up to the point I quit reading. she was more outgoing  boisterous  and regardless of her jen or she-hulk personality  she wasn t what we re seeing today with the she-hulk series. we re seeing the same exact personality with this iteration  regardless of form she s in. I d also say when I read the comics from late 70s to early 90s  the she-hulk didn t think of all men negatively  as this iteration does. thats on the writing team. hope that helps to clarify at least where Im coming from.
@flash2814  character development......
@deonte carlisle  what  when do he imply she hated anyone  humans love meat how would you infer hate from his statement
@deonte carlisle  she did claim she had it tougher than him because she got cat-called a few times and had men disagree with her about elements of her job.  she seemed really bent out of shape and mad enough it could be seen as hateful towards her cousin bruce.Imean  all that happened to him was - cursed with a powerful alter ego he previously had no control over- nearly killed his girlfriend during his first transformation- had to go on the run from the military like a fugitive- went to the arctic to attempt to off himself but his powerful alter ego stopped that- accidentally poisoned an old man with some of his blood while working at a bottling factory- wrecked the bottling factory trying to escape from the military- did property damage to a university escaping the military- realizes he can never be physically intimate again because the transformations were originally triggered by blood pressure spikes- research that accidentally created him also created abomination and the leader  2 villains-  kinda broke  harlem new york having to stop his rival hulk  abomination- damaged the shield helicarrier thanks to an attack by lokI triggering a transformation- feeling guilt and fear for accidentally helping to create a murderous a.i. bent on ending the human race- did massive property damage to an african country s city after being transformed by scarlet witch and put a teammate in danger trying to contain him- pines for a fellow teammate in black widow but wary of injuring or killing her accidentally - lost 2 years of his life on an alien planet fighting in a gladiator death arena as his powerful alter ego killing a number of opponents - not being able to transform and help his teammates during fights in new york and wakanda - potentially contributing to future catastrophic planetary incursion events simply for taking the stairs while transformed and allowing lokI to get the space stone which causes reality and multiversal calamities- finding out the teammate he pined for died while on a mission - nearly dying while using the stark gauntlet to undo thanos  finger snap and still being unable to bring back the teammate he pined for even with the God like power of the stones- having to fight thanos  forces once again with a badly burned hand and arm and almost drowning with rocket and rhodey beforehand- watching a brother in scientific study and a battlefield teammate in stark die to help save the universeand thats all.but no  tell me again how much worse his cousin has it over him.
agree
@david catlett  yes and also as a child had a bad relationship with his father  who was possibly abusive  not explicitly stated  and possibly killed his mother in front of him.
agree
because they didn t read the comics
bury
@cosmic space thing  yes bro just look up the interview
I love the show I am a big fan
I hate the term  mansplaining.  its an attempt for land whales to further victimize themselves. everybody gets condescended to. its not because your a woman. its mostly because the person doing is generally an older person  not always men  who are trying to be helpful but since they re older and come from a different generation  and everybody is so gd pussified nowadays  people make it into way more bigger issues than it needs to be. also yeah they dumped on the wrecking crew. huge slap in the face to comic fans.
she-hulk is the equivalent of any of the people out there that was selling one thing by how they dressed and then when they close come off  you find out the person you thought was a girl is actually a guy.  tell me how she wasn t selling one thing and then he ended up with something else the next morning!  the thing that really pisses me off is that these idiots out there  then have the nerve to say that the person that was tricked is in the wrong and they have to accept what the person doing the tricking is doing!
omg this show is becoming more cringe af  also melonie mac getting there with that 40k.
she-hulk told hulk thatshe doesnt have another persona  so when she hulked out on those guys she was going to kill them because she wanted to. the rage monster was just her
would ally mcbeal twerk at the office   no  no she would not.
I think lady bird is a great example of a recent female written directed hollywood movie full of humor  thatshows women in a very positive and empowering light  while also having some heart to it. sure its not meant to be a  sitcom   but its much funnier than she hulk  imo. I would presume it was also intended primarily for a  female audience  but doesnt have any of the horrible contrived situations and paper thin characters like this show. proof that things dont have to be shit in order to appeal to women  or be about women. it also has better user ratings on imdb from men and women than she hulk  in every age range.
in the episode after this one  they actually do explain that the suit is ugly on her and she needs new better looking clothes. I think it was the villain who mentions it tho. but still  the tall man suit was a deliberate choice. the problem is they dont mention it hint at it being a writing choice at any point before then. so it does make sense until you water a couple of episodes afterwards. which isn t good writing.
8 46 funny thing is  she literally said that herself  about herself  in the first or second episode
Im honestly surprised youre still watching this show.  its like they took all the worst feminist tropes and put them into one show.if you want to binge something that has much better writing  try farscape. you d love aeryn right away I think. and the cgI is better than she-hulk despite being 20 years old  maybe Im exaggerating the cgI but still .
I heard tons of special effects quit daily off marvel projects and if I had to make she hulk twerk I d be gone too
Im 27 white male growing up I love lilo and stitch as I could see myself in lilo as I was bully in school and found it hard to make friends and my home always had dogs.  I have an irish wolfhound   2 dachshund now  growing up I love watching eddie murphy movies. what I have notice is when an community make s new story people outside that community who love the story s start appreciate that community growing up racist behavior was on the way down because people where enjoy black culture with their movie  show  music and games. now hollywood is taking the european culture and replacing the characters with black people and making people and destroying to meaning behind their story s. what is now increasing racist s behavior towards black people because there taking other people culture and not respecting them. now the younger generation love anime and manga and love japans culture what is removing racist s behavior towards asian people.
hail to you melonie looking forward to seeing you on fnt today...
100  agree. m-she-u at its finest.
hey came across your channel about a week ago.  I like rockstars even though they are total marvel shills.  they never say anything bad about the quality of the she-hulk writing.  as bad as she-hulk is I am a marvel fan.  I started reading comics in the mid  70s.  it was so great to watch infinity war and endgame.  I quit reading about the same time they were trying to decide how to out northstar  in the late  90s.  I used to collect most of the black marvel characters  black goliath  luke cage falcon and cap.  couldn t groove with the early kirby art so I never read black panther.  where am I going   I guess to say that disney still has some good talent.  I love turning red so there is no excuse for she-hulk other than to prove they think they can print money.  the money creek will dry up if they continue.  I say that but star wars continues to crank out crap.
I still find it wild that the twerking episode had a scene with the transforming elf threatening to look like the guy and getting him sexual assault allegations and more. so false allegations in the episode and its shown as if she s justified. just wrong on so many levels
I will say the look should get better since she got suits that are customized for her.
10 15 which is probably the most unrealistic thing in the mcu so far. she would be getting hundreds of matches per day.
15 00 she used him to pay for the chips  her real goal. she is a monster. _jc
they really hamfisted the virtue signaling in today s episode. its pretty clear no one involved with this didn t read any she-hulk comics in preparation of making this. hopefully charlie cox doesnt let them ruin daredevil since he actually did his research to make daredevil what it deserved to be
defeminizing women and making them into psuedomen is the biggest crime of these writers.
so close yayyy!
I literally just started re-watching farscape on freevee last night. I love thatshow. fringe is really good also.
@mike casino  yes  all the characters are so great. aeryn and zaan especially though are legitstrong women. melonie would love both of them.
need to rewatch. used to name my ships moya back in the eve online days
hImelonie  I know km late.I always enjoy your opinions  thoughts on these very interesting topics.I dont watch thatseries thanks for everything you do for your chanel.
honestly in his position I would have stayed and talked more  cause it would be interesting.everyone knows that hulk turns to banner so its logically sound to assume she could as well  so once she shows her human stuff id ask about that.shes the same in both forms after all.
you know  if I were she-bulks boss and I walked by and saw her twerking on the clock it might be time to explain her field of expertise.
I really wish marvel can do something different with she hulk in the future...
yea the big offense is definitely thatshe catfished him.
marvel  along with everything else  is going to continue to tank if they dont wake up. of course  I guess you could say its the rest of us not getting all woke enough to go along
meets with guy from dating app    youre horrible! guy she met on dating app    you got on a dating app.  how horrible are you  sh     Im  a super hero! guy    thats pretty low  but Im not picky.
I noticed she looks like she was dressed by her grandma I didn t even know it was the same actress
chozen s near death in cobra kaI season 5 by terry  sword fight  was lulz.  all the kids turn on terry and he s arrested.
absolutely love and am very impressed by your take on this especially considering a previous video you did thatseemed as if you were claiming that Christian women should not feel any responsible if the way they dress and present themselves physically around men if it provokes sexual thoughts towards them which is completely false and as a Christian I felt that was a very dangerous  misleading and prideful false messaging... so perhaps I didn t clearly understand the message you were trying to convey in that video
its disappointing  maslany was sexy in all her incarnations on orphan black but she still was taken seriously by the fans of the show. the show was full of great characters  cant really think of a character that wasn t well written. she- hulk couldn t be more different.
that wallpaper tho ! mal  we need a let s play of the true tr games  classics ofc  !!!  d
she-hulk can break the 4th wall  so she knows that there s an audience of women and men watching her  yet she still twerked in front of them.
its been a while since Ive heard the phrase  hanky-panky  lol
jen catfished him! she didnt tell him another form  thats lying by omission!
sorcerer supreme has so little sorcering to do that he s spending time watching movies with some drunk chick. he also turned into the wizard that doesnt understand the ways of human society even though he s been normally civilized in the past.
I dont think she  used  him.  he had a fantasy about being with this amazon type woman  and it came true.  when he saw the real jen  the fantasy was over.  he was kind of stupid. surely he knew thatshe hulk was not her normal form.  I d say it was mostly mutual. he had an unrealistic expectation that jen was always in she hulk form.
men and women both love she hulk.  blind and deaf men and women  to be precise.
they need to make the hulk model either a lot better or a lot worse.  thanx melonie !
known melonie quite a long time and I never thought she this real type of woman. love it.but fr tho... what s the name of thatsong at the end
haha. yeah  what Imeant in that video is that it is our  men and women alike  responsibility to keep ourselves from sinning regardless of whether someone is trying to temp us or not. ultimately if I sin its my fault. nobody can force us to sin. if we lust over someone we are still at fault for ourselves regardless of what the person was wearing.
I like maddysinn  lol she is actually one of the very few entertaining parts of the show tbh
what s great about this twerk scene isn t the fact that it happened. write a good show and Im all for funny little moments that dont really make any sense post credits. however  if you see her behind the scenes in the motion cap suit you see that they had to cgI an ass on this woman and its sooo pronounced that its kind of degrading. basically the same thing as airbrushing a model on a magazine before you put it on shelves. which is something thats supposed to be incredibly degrading.
still has shoulderpads as she-hulk
the show is garbage. if I was a customer client and saw an employee twerking  I would complain to the boss and if I was the boss then the person would be punished and if the person continued to do so then the person would be fired. you cant be doing inappropriate crap like that in a workplace. we know full well that the impressionable young girls that watched this episode are going to start twerking in the workplace and other places where they shouldn t. I also dont like thatshe-hulk looked at her date as a piece of meat instead of a person and thatshe is a huge hypocrite such as not liking that guys only talk about themselves but when she gets a guy that wants to know about her she only talks about herself.
on the next catfish    shehulk takes advantage.....
is this one if those woke shows  I dont remember she hulk being that popular back in the day.
is anyone even gonna ask how cole train s mental health is doing through all these awful shows
using the show to respond to negative criticism is cringe. it just goes to show that its bothering them. if they didn t care they wouldn t waste moments of show time that could be spent  I dont know  making the show not garbage
2 00 the baggy suit in her hulk form makes no sense. the suit is meant to be baggy in he normal form  so it has room for when she is on her hulk form. if the suit is baggy on her hulk form  then when she come back to her normal form she will look like a 5yo kid on parent s clothes. it is amazing how they managed to screw this up. other bad writers wouldn t think about the suit and just make the suit escale to her current size and the audience would probally not even think about it. but no  they drawn attention to the suitsize topic  then proceeded to screw it up.
woman  oh we re fighting for our lives in iran woman  ohhhhh girl thats nothing I cantell you some stories about how I was mansplained to  so I guess we re both patriots
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that you are doing a great job with making videos and talking about each movies and tv shows and video games and everything else that is on your mind. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to tell you that this she-hulk tv show series is getting so bad reviews that people are still talking about and how woke people wont let it go and so I just wanted to let you know that I think that they should cut the show off and leave it out so that people can move on forward and talk about something else and just stop talking about this awful tv show series on disney plus  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to make a comment about this topic of the video and I just want to tell you that you are doing well fantastic job with making each video like this everyday  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie. also have a great weekend too melonie.
mel  do you watch much anime  if so  I highly recommend kill la kill. slightly selfishly  as I d love to see your take on its depiction of femme fatales and femininity. its also the best kind of insane with pimps in golden crab robots  nudist terrorists  and evil fashion ceos trying to conquer the earth with super-powered clothes.
we need creeps and psychos to keep women in line
the wrecking crew with asgardian weapons is a groupnof thor villains.  they turned them into a mummer s farce in this show.  they have give thor a run for his money at times in the comics  but they are no match for she-hulk with her wisdom and experience battling super villains.  smh
her mouth didn t look that big in ep1.
they ve followed the disney pattern of ruining heros  she-hulk had a solid mix of an audience....then they made horrible comics and an even worse show
here s the problem with this show - it wants to be fun and silly like ally mcbeal  which.... ok... fine... but ally mcbeal also bothered to give the characters at least a minor degree of development  and had moments of real sincerity. it was far less on the nose about social issues  as in  not every male was reduced to being a scumbag  misogynist or idiot. not to mention that ally didn t always get her own way  so it was possible to empathise with her complaints and struggle. so while mcbeal had enough charm to get away with silly behaviour in the office  she hulk doesnt. it feels like a  feminist   I use that word in the loosest sense of the term  without the nuance that real feminism has  stand up rant  typed up  and puked on screen.
hire thinkers  not activists
I find the series hilarious. the original comic book didn t take itself seriously most of the time. I think the problem is  Im not 100  sure on this   but... its a female character  written by a woman. directed by a woman. not many women can write male characters  likewise a lot of men cant write females well. the main problem is how all the characters are written bad  c mon.... making the wrecking crew a bunch of bumblefs was just... bad! comic book wrecking crew are a bunch of badasses for b- level characters  as for the hook-up stuff... she hulk is a bitstreet in the comics!! she banged juggernaut!!!!
as a  john byrne  she-hulk fn  I was really hoping this would be normal and non-woke...... totally shoulda known....
she hulk was hugely popular. not on the level of the x-men  fantastic four  or spider-man  but she was a solid a tier.
not a tier. thats wolverine status. she is below that level of popularity. not even close lol.
not hugely popular but well liked and at least general population has heard of her in some way. I wont pretend to have read her comics but I have comics with her in it and I always enjoyed when she was around
@d  kek  wolverine was s-tier as part of the x-men. she hulk was the level below that  a fan favourite but not a flagpole of the brand.
@duncan mcokiner  kek  much lower.
@d  tell me you dont know anything about marvel without telling me you dont know anything about marvel.
@duncan mcokiner  okay   you dont know anything about marvel without telling me you dont know anything about marvel.
@duncan mcokiner  we have a winner!!!
@duncan mcokiner  a tier  nah.
he needs prayer lol
@melonie mac go boom  stay strong little cole train haha
@radical reggie  lotta people denying it without any argument today. still  lets me know Im right.
@duncan mcokiner  you can feel your right. I strongly disagree with you being right  but its all good.
@radical reggie  is everyone on this thread except me on drugs  what does that even mean
@duncan mcokiner  you dont need to worry about it. enjoy your show.
@radical reggie   you dont agree with my opinion on thing a  so you must also like thing b.  five year old children understand that logic makes no sense. but apparently  its gone over your head.
@duncan mcokiner  nah I just dont agree with your opinion and have moved on. if your trying to shame people into agreeing with you  its not going to happen on this thread.
@radical reggie  well thats not what I was trying to do  and anyone with two brain cells to rub together would be able to know that. I smell projection  and smug projection at that.
I watched it when it first dropped. pretty fun but I didn t get super into it
@melonie mac go boom  fair.
I hear ya people like us who grew up loving these characters and always wanted to see them on tv or movies seems to feel like a monkey paw effect everytime they do   instead of being excited when I hear about marvel bringing one to live-action I find myself going oh God how bad is it gonna be  lol
agent carter is a way better representation of how to portray a strong women in a male dominated field.
ok has anyone every read the she-hulk run from dan slot. what is in the show was basically what was in the actually comic run for several years before the show. so that what they did in the show. also she-hulk was breaking the fourth wall in comics for years  even before deadpool started doing. heck sometimes she would literally get in arguments with the writers. Imean most for her dan slot run was about the courtroom or her personal life. most of the show was just the comics for years and years ago. so just saying I dont think this was as woke as people think. now not saying it was great. the cgI drove me crazy and some lines of dialog were not great be it was not a trash as people think. just my 2 cents or more like a dollar. just wanted to say that. peace to all and what do you think of james gunn taking control of d.c. universal. keep the show going your awesome sauce.
its so dumb. she hulk looks like michael jackson.
I dont watch this show but I love laughing at it through the reviews of people mocking it.dont you love how she gets this fancy new job and then immediately complains as she realizes she was hired because she s also the she-hulk.   basically saying she knows what a great lawyer she is and she should be appreciated for what she can do for the company.then during the first days at the new job we see her twerk in her office while  on the job .  in episode 4 we see her creating her tinder profile so she can get laid - while she s  on the job .   she really shouldn t brag about the value she brings to the company when most of what she s doing there is goofing off...
hold up  I just noticed  did you place your face on jj the jet plane
concerning jen s work attire  episode 4 acknowledges the reason she is dressed in an unflattering suit is because she couldn t find any professional clothes that fit her body. nikkImakes a comment about getting her a new wardrobe and the latest sneak peak trailer shows her in a form fitting suit. its a story point
I have lost count of how many men she has disowned since this show started. besides  its the hypocrisy I dont get. Imean  women like her complain about sexualization in our entertainment  but ok to twerk their asses in front of everyone  rules for thee but not for me  hey! dont get me wrong  I know there s always been exotic dancers in films  and there are some gullible men. but why does one get a pass and not the other  how does that make sense !!! quick answer  none!!!!! you cant have it both ways. you either accept it or ban it all!
if mean girls was directed towards women then help me with my bra bro.
talk about missing the forest for the trees...the baggy suit is clearly meant to be a men s suit at this point  I dont believe there s any ulterior motive about making her less attractive than her comic form. lets reason through this. the show hasn t had a long passage of time since jen started hulk lawyering  thus her comment about needing to find a new wardrobe in one of the previous episodes. I doubt there s any brand out there that makes professional attire in spandex  per bruce s suggestion   so what do you do in a pinch  get something off the shelf that can accommodate her correct hulk stature at the very least. there s even a scene in this episode that focuses on her to-do list  and one of the entries is to join the big   tall clothing club or whatever  so finding better clothes is on her radar  but she s gotta make due in the meantime. who knows how its going to play out going forward  maybe she ll get custom tailored stuff  I dunno.the dating stuff is eh. as an outside observer in public I can definitely say Ive seen those types of guys quite a lot. is it everyone  no  but thats some pretty typical behavior for a ton of people. as far as that last doctor guy that jen goes home with  Ive got two thoughts on that. first  I dont recall if average people in the mcu are aware that hulk transforms or if they think thats just how they are all the time. I would assume that they would know it is a transformation  which would make his reaction the morning after a dick move. second  jen treated him like that because she went through all the trash and finally thought she found a good guy  so she was really thirsty. however  it can also be seen as commentary on catfishing or in more simpler practice just pretending to be something youre not on a date  especially if we look at it as the guy legitimately did not know she transformed into a normal woman. or if you want to distill it down even further  that meme of who you thought you left the bar with at 3am vs who you woke up next to  though neither of them seemed drunk like good old maddy there.Im just saying there s more nuance to this than the  man bad  argument if you just think about it for a second. Ive got my fair share of complaints with the show  and face palm moments   but I d give it a solid 6 so far. Im so tired of people jumping on the hate train but only giving surface level observations or talking points about why its bad. its certainly not a masterpiece of cinema by any means... now rings of power on the other hand  that deserves all the criticism it gets. at least it looks nice from what Ive seen.
I havent suffered through the crapshow after those previews  but at least in the comics  why does she need to be green monster to practice law  wtf
this has to be the laziest she-hulk review  next to askyourselfstich  saying  the writer of rick and morty wrote a scene about a pickle and that was the tipping point  to get her to write for she-hulk. you didn t even critique the show accurately.so many details of the show  you completely missed.like the suits being too big on her- in the next scene  she explains that its difficult to find suits that fit her she-hulk form.its almost as if  she s starting to decide to turn back to her regular jennifer self  less. so she ll need a wardrobe to fit her she-hulk form...when she got attacked walking to her car  it wasn t because she was a woman  doofy. its because that group wants her blood. how did you miss the bent needle scene  it wasn t a  weak woman gets attacked by men  scene...it was  she-hulk gets attacked by a gang trying to get her blood.  she went on one bad date with a guy who didn t offer to pay for the meal. not many. she was objectified as well  as soon as the guy thatshe hooked up with  saw her in her regular non-she-hulk form. literally one of the major conflicts  is that jennifer is trying to figure out  do people like me  for me  or do they like me as in  she-hulk  another point of the show  that you seem to have missed. this was even in the trailer.the twerking scene with megan the stallion  was an after creditscene. but im glad you made that a front and center complaint for the rest of this sloppy critique. it was an end credit joke scene  holding zero relevance to the episode of the show.why would the actress in the show  dress exactly as she dresses...in a photoshoot...why would the character in the show  have the same style confidence etc...as the...actress...she-hulk wasn t written or based on tatiana maslany... maybe its hard for you to watch  because you just dont watch it. like at all.
real she hulk always had her suits tailored to not hde her curves
Im not surprised this show is bad. I didn t even give it a try. I knew what it was going to be.
Ive droped by the first episode.
these are people who are okay with a biological man posing as a woman  right up to the point of having sex with another man who doesnt realize thats what they are.  so of course they d blame the guy in thatscene from she hulk.
is she hulk how feminist see them selves in there own mind
lmao Im sorry  I had to pause  the amount of times u unironically said wokeness was the issuelike   who  r  u   bill  mar
if thatsame dude is the abosrbing man I swear to God
whoa!  the pic where she s facing  with her hands on hips those are  man hands   without a doubt.check for an adam s apple.
twitter get hard for she hulk bad humor
well in the comics  she likes being in her she-hulk form more  so she does so nearly all the time. as opposed to this show where she has to whine about everything.
oh God  your upset someone criticized something you enjoy... better grab the pitchforks
@tacitcat  nope  that wasn t my criticism. I said melanie s criticism of the show was pathetic and explained why. its almost as if she didn t watch the show  and I say that  specifically towards the things in the show thatshe criticized...which are explained in the episode and depicted clearly. I never said anything about her  you or anyone needing to like the show  just because I like it.
@krs-1  wait  so the twerking scene isn t in the show
@rodiusmaximus  nope  it was an after creditscene completely unrelated to the episode
@krs-1  so...the part that noone watches  Imean  even if unrelated to the story  they still chose to include it.
@rodiusmaximus  it was a just after creditscene  it was just meant to be goofy. its like in end game  when they re all sitting around eating shawarma s
@krs-1  ok. thanks for the tip. I googled that  and I now know that all of the kebab shops Ive ever been to are actually selling shawarmas. but yeah  I had no idea end game had anything after the credits  so I ll assume that at least some other people are like me in that regard.also  there s no harm in children seeing people eat  but seeing a large green woman shaking  grinding and whatever could scar someone for life.
@rodiusmaximus  all good  yeah this is common of marvel to add end creditscenes. it really wasn t thatserious
yes
not only does she have man hands  but if Imight make another seinfeld reference  she s technically a two-face.
14 44 naw stop thats on him for not doing his bare minimum research!  in fact what  research  lmao everyone on that planet with a degree knows that hulk canturn back into his human form   90  of those people should in turn know or at least assume thatshehulk can do this but better  otherwise she wouldn t be allowed to work the position she s working smh plus literally the term hulk comes from hulking out. pretty much a synonym to transforming
its always the man s fault anymore dont you know that
condescending women bosses are a thing too.
fwiw  womansplaining is just as prevalent as mansplaining  particularly in relationships  its just that men dont complain about it.
anybody noticed how in the show and at marverl at all srsly.. they saw a female hulk and immediately named she-hulk ! I thought they all about wokeness and inclusion  trans rights etc.. but then they make a  mistake  like this and nobody asks questions ! damn  missed out opportunity! another thing id like to highlight is  I guess its would be very dangerous to have sexual intercourse with a she-hulk one thing even more scarrier is having it with the regular hulk  so I assume if the dude wanted to get away with bones intact  she had to turn back at some point  or maybe the dude did all the job while she was just laying there ! it gets really weird the more you think about it!
uniforms are supposed to be doll it makes sense even more as she supposed to be a loyer so uh it looks more professional
you should do a reaction to cm punk s media scrum from all out. this is the hot topic on the left interwebs. most people have come to expect less than quality   sjw forced diversity stuff from marvel. probably why disney is offering 1.99 for a month. I think I am done with marvel after thor love and thunder.
they dont want women to be hot
glad I dont have to watch this stuff to make content
missing your beautiful straight hair...
unreal  who even wrote that
she-hulk is dumb because she makes a tinder profile as a giant green woman. then the next morning she isn t a giant green woman. the guy leave and she has the pikachu face on.
damn them
women dont have to look perfect  but the double standards between she hulk and thor are pretty damn stupid. this is straight up sexism
thats first picture makes me not want to watch this show. I cant believe twirking is acceptable. so in other words  this show shows us how out of touch we are  these day.
well  they did put her in a man s suit and shirt  so  it isn t going to fit right  unless tailored.
its just a bad show. horrible writing  not funny. I love your take because I 100  agree with it all.
hImelonie thought on the comic witchblade and darkness
fan service for women good fan service for men bad
I haven t watched anything mcu since the first few episodes of wandavision then I switched off. seems I got a lucky escape.
well my hair is naturally curly and Im not forcing itstraight any more any time soon lol
classics!
wandavision was great except the finale.
you sound so midwestern lol like minnesota or something  but yeah this show is bad enough said
hanky-panky
savages!!!!
play stupid games  win stupid prizes
10 48 what s wrong with that  its 2022   bout time women paid their way!
I haven t watched anything mcu since thor 2. I cant support their trash anymore. its a shame.
hI from the u.k. where is your accent from
why is she always green  isnt that for when shes mad     I dont read the comics  and I never will. the whole idea is just weird
tatiana looks rundown nowadays. feminism will do that to you. she was a knockout in orphan black and in her twenties and teens.
the cgI looks like claymation. her suit looked like play doh. her face in the selfie looks like something from madame tussauds. the phone  of course its an iphone  should be much smaller if her hands were those of a 7 foot tall monster woman. and who holds a phone like that  it just looks low rent. its dollar store cw.
if the show has overt feminist bs the writers claim its for women ... if it fails then its the men s fault for not watching it
what  no bikinI car wash  show sucks
men might enjoy hot she-hulk  they cant have that  naked thor is somehow different though  cos stuff and things
Im glad I skipped this show
its disgusting
man bad man bad man bad   I am going to go twerk now in my professional office     women can do whatever they want whenever they want   man bad man bad man bad
good thing im not watching this feminist wet dream bumpster fire.
on thatsuit- why are the shoulders so flat  its unnatural that a person with muscles would have shoulders like that. also  where are the neck muscles  she s a pencil neck. cgI fail.
twerking either looks embarrassing  amusing or horrible. the act of twerking itself is not sexy.
remember when heroes learned lessons thereby being able to teach those watching the stories lessons  ummm  what lesson was taught from this episode or any of the other drunky  ego-twisting episodes so far  terrible show. 1 10.
neh... let s just be honest  the actress is not even beautiful... mediocre at best
2 27  lol  oh how the turns have tabled   this  jumping to conclusions thatsupport her argument that everything is a sign of overly-woke changes  has lead to yet another argument backfiring on your channel xd     impulsively yet unintentionally this impatient tuber coincidentally predicts her own misjudgment by jokingly judging that the baggy suit was so bad itseemed almost as if it was on purpose which  joke s on u cuz it was and we all already knew that from the trailers thatshe was gonna get  not just a new super suit but also fitting work suits   every day clothes from someone specialized in this later down the line
its just a post credit joke.
I dont know why you have such a negative attitude towards stuff not in your own control ! ! its like youre ebenezer scrooge  knit picking at everything. cant people just be happy without criticism
brooooo shutup.
why not make her suit out of thatstretchy material you always see adverts on facebook for  claims that it will stretch allot without tearing. make her entire suit out of thatso it is fit when she is herself and after she gets angry and become  she hulk
but meg s music goes against everything this show claims to stand for.
@tom coop  oh I dont like her music  but I can separate that.
@douglas briel  the show doesnt separate that clearly.
she reviews shows.
why are you so negative over something not in your control !  you mean.... like the reviews opinion and criticism of the person your attacking for not blindly liking a thing you like  nobody said you cant like the show. the video is an expression of why she doesnt like it. how is thatsuch a difficult concept
@tacitcat  Im simply stating that melonie tends to pick and poke at little things that really are not that big of a deal. positive energy over negative energy  but  just like you stated  Im allowed to have my own opinions  even if it doesnt align with hers. she s always complaining about something  in my opinion.
@tacitcat  we are living in a social injustice where everyone is supposed to nod and agree with the next person. youre not allowed to have a rational opinion yourself  if it doesnt fit the narrative of what the other person is saying  it defeats the purpose of having a voice if you just block the person thats not agreeing with you.
isn t that a bit hypocritical  youre showing a negative attitude towards stuff you cant control  i.e. her review.
