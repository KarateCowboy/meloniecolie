  Hope you are ready for voice reading of your chosen keywords in chat and voice activated stream commands, because they are in testing and its awesome!<br>
  Lets say you are moderating a couple different streams or AFK from a stream for a moment - whenever someone mentions "moderator", your username, or maybe some other keyword in one stream/browser tab, your computer will read outloud that chat message for you to hear since you are not staring at that written chat at the moment.<br>
  Let's say you are holding your game controller or busy playing the game as a streamer but need to refresh the page, clip, take a screenshot, scroll up, or something else on your chat computer. Why take your hands off the mouse or controller when you can speak a command to do those things for you?
