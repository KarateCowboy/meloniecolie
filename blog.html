  Finishing up today our Spotify product today for Youtube, Twitch, and Glimesh. 
  To circumvent certain issues when streaming, this allows the streamer to login and add different Spotify playlists based on games or keywords. 
  Then, when viewers attend your stream with your keyword or game and activated, that Spotify playlist will start playing for them automatically locally on their computer.
  Everyone can listen to the songs together selected by the streamer but from their own computer, not broadcasted.

  Done my streamer interviews, testing, and got my Glimesh and Lunr initial products working (although they will not release for a bit until those platforms launch). Celebrated family and friend graduations and been released from helping them. Made my personal research & development schedule for the near future. Feeling the butterflies again, ready to do this!

  Hope you are ready for voice reading of your chosen keywords in chat and voice activated stream commands, because they are in testing and its awesome!<br>
  Lets say you are moderating a couple different streams or AFK from a stream for a moment - whenever someone mentions "moderator", your username, or maybe some other keyword in one stream/browser tab, your computer will read outloud that chat message for you to hear since you are not staring at that written chat at the moment.<br>
  Let's say you are holding your game controller or busy playing the game as a streamer but need to refresh the page, clip, take a screenshot, scroll up, or something else on your chat computer. Why take your hands off the mouse or controller when you can speak a command to do those things for you?
