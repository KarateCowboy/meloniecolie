screen writers   if the star is male  let s change them to female. if the star is female  lets turn them non gender conforming. fans   how about you just create a new character  screen writers   why would we do that when we already have a perfectly good established character we can just update for a modern audience  fans   facepalm   well  we wont be watching it then. screen writers   good  its not for you anyway. fans   rejects the  reimagining  and saves their money screen writers   why is no one paying to see our movies!  fans   because you ruined everything we liked about it  write what we want and we ll go see it. screen writers   while fleeing to their safe spaces   noooooooooooooo!
apparently  disney is using a practice called  scrapbooking  where they film multiple different versions of a movie or show to pick-and-choose what they want for test audiences. its already pretty costly  and if audiences hate every version that they came up with  thats a really bad sign for disney.
I cant wait for indiana jones to put his hat on mary sue and say  you complete me.
indiana jones should ve ended after the third installment. a fantastic trilogy with a beautiful sendoff. Im just so pleased they ll be wrecking another one of my childhood favorites with some dang lady with a chip on her shoulder
activists... why did it have to be activists
0 23  they dont care as much about establishing a female indiana jones  as much as they do about destroying the male indiana jones.  a lot of people tend to think they are doing these things to try and push the agenda  which is likely accurate to a degree.   their primary goal though  is to destroy the male leads  and characters that have been established.   melonie  a vision as always.
indy to mary sue  the hat s yours now  kid. mary sue  sneering  you belong in a museum.
from what I heard there were 7 alternative endings all having her replace dr. jones and none of them even had test audiences sparking a modicum of interest
the 4th movie should have been done in the 90s if they were going to do it  and itshould have been indiana as a monuments man during wwiI  protecting art  and seeking the spear of destiny.
everyone needs to go watch relic hunter. it was a television show that ran from  99 to  02 and starred tia carerre as sydney fox  who was basically a cross between indiana jones and lara croft. it was a great show.
sounds like they want to replace indiana jones with a woman. I only want harison ford playing that role. not everything has to continue. the first three are all I need. we need classic lara croft tr movie  like what we kinda got with angelina jolie tr. good video. love seeing you melonie. I need one of those hoodies. take care melonie.
the story about the replacing of indiana jones was there from the beginning of the project.  phoebe waller-bridge has been being pushed as the replacement. but the story has been lying low because of all the craziness involving the filming.  this film has taken a while to get anywhere close to being finished and plagued with incidents to the point of being called cursed.  I barely got through kingdom of the crystal skull  and after harrison ford went along with letting han solo being killed in force awakens  he obviously just doesnt care what he attaches his name to now.  either recast now or retire the character for awhile.  waller-bridge is mainly a screenwriter with some modicum of success with her show fleabag thats supposed to be funny  and she was in solo  so she s she s got connections to the disney camp.  she knows someone  thats the only way I canthink of as to how she is getting this job.  not impressed.
overLord dvd has been reporting on this for a year now. everything he has reported on this has been pretty much dead accurate and the details he has are pretty frightening
simple suggestion for better direction I think  the first film had indy as a professor.  final film should have him on expedition with a class of students.  they could be amazed at his physical and mental prowess  as he teaches and brings them along.  end result.  good movie that hurts no reputations.  opens door to an entire class of students  actors  to pick from and pick up the mantle of indy.
yeah  I have been following this for a while. one of the orginal things kk wanted to do was use time travel to effect things  fuck with the reality and have the phoebe waller-bridge being indy the whole time cause old indy and young indy died and she took on the mantel. basicly undoing the whole franchise so kk can redo it all. they really need to get kk tf out of there cause by the time they are done there wont be enough fans left to make the money they want.
they could have dakota  montana and louisiana jones go on adventures as sisters and descendant of the legendary indiana jones.  guess what I found in granpa s old chest!
crystal skull was awful - I wasn t looking for a new indy installment anyways. but with the plans fleshing out for this new one  in the immortal words of rick deckard  ironically also portrayed by ford    I was quit when I come in here  bryant  Im twice as quit now .
one piece has a woman lead in it and it made  100 million dollars on opening week. that lead was an original character  not a carbon copy of an existing character. maybe these writers should take notes.
interesting. I can definitely see the parallels between her and the og lara. she even has the dark hair and dark eyes. maybe the producers are also fans of the original tomb raider and thought to themselves  fine  if cd cant get their shI together  we ll do it ourselves  I find itso ironic that they re looking everywhere for  strong female characters   even going so far as to make pre-established feminine characters more masculine and more badass  but the original lara croft is seen as sexist  that doesnt make any sense.love your take on tomb raider mel  I remember you from back in the day on the tr forums from the early 2000 s
Im pretty sure there was an adult movie parody many years ago that replaced indy with a woman and I bet the story is better than anything hollywood could come up with these days
producers   your racist misogynistic
so its like a chose your own adventure for executives.
but if the test audience is hand selected from a particular demographic by design  then they will get the results they want every time.  I am not convinced this doesnt happen with  say  star trek..
being in disneys shoes  I would consider just scraping not scrapbooking...instead of squeezing out the final jus from harrison ford and killing him off by getting bit by a snake!!
rise of skywalker had like 10 endings
@mike rosoft  but its written by r l stein
there s no scraps in my scrapbook  - philly leotardo  the sopranos.
@anderclips  and it was still boring
@iris  I think you mean a trash fire
@anderclips  right you are
- the hat is literal perfection. - it will be  when it fits a woman.
oh God  Im gonna barf
dont give kk any ideas!
and mart sue says  paart time.
then blame men when it fails.
any original stories ever again.
@immopimmo  thats from batwoman right
there are only 3 indiana jones movies! you cant convince me otherwise! the only lego indy game was the first one! the sky is blue!!
absolutely! the last crusade was a fantastic movie and  as you said had an excellent send-off.
@fccphoto  oh gosh  lego indiana jones 2 was so bad...
it did. there are only three indy films.
@harbl99  the  th one was more comedic than anything.and excuse my wtf over! indy had a son yeah let s just toss that out the damn window! the fact that he had a child and got married is the only thing they shouldn t have thrown away from the  th movie.
believe it or not  Im ok with kingdom or the crystal skull . . . hear me out.  indie and marion got married so Im good leaving it there.  yeah  they jumped the shark with the aliens  but it tied up all of the loose ends.  I can begrudgingly leave it at that.  dont want or need any more indiana jones.  plus harrison ford is 80 . . . they re trying to kill him.
3 star wars movies  6 star trek movies  3 indiana jones movies  2 terminator movies  1 matrix movie.
@photriuspyrelus  2 predator movies  2 alien movies  2 ghostbusters movies.
well easy for you to say that after you know the outcome! what if the last crusade sucked  you d say  they should have stopped after temple doom . george lucas should have ended the star wars movies after return of the jedI  my point is its easy to judge the past but very difficult to judge the future.
@mala  I knew I was forgetting some!
@cory82  not really. in the third movie  there was clearly a plan to send the character off in a meaningful way. lucas and ford both wanted to move on to other projects. also  ford was in shape  energetic and focused at that time. the 4th movie was obviously just an afterthought. ford was out of age  and they ran out of ideas for the character. the movie was as good as one could expect with such ingredients  pointless  lauy and average. a cash grap  not a passion project - not for the creator  nor for the lead actor. as will be the next installment.
@photriuspyrelus  there are certainly even more examples. like 2 Godfather movies.
@mala  1 land before time movie. 4 superman movies. 0 suicide squad movies....
yep you are spot on.  the only way to really continue would be to recast and go as a younger man after historical objects but it wont happen hollywood will f it up and go all girl power instead of common sense.
I bet that chip on her shoulder has low calories
neither i! indy is special yo me  that feeling on high pulpish  non consequential adventure...I remember myself as a kid wandering in my grandparents   home in the countryside  with my satchel  my pith helmet  and my caps revolver wandering  exploring around...
I do  enjoyy far better the last crusade after my dad s passing away
honestly I treat 3 like the end. its my favorite anyways.
facts  these new movies were not needed
@photriuspyrelus  new matrix was fine not great but fine the rest are total trash stop watching hollywood  its thatsimple
nice play on a classic phrase
why not have short round take over as the new indy
@big guy617  that would only happen of short round was a girl
oh yike
valiant talked about how they took liberties with the term  test audiences  more like they took staff as in house screening etc.
@melonie mac go boom  when youreferenced lara croft you forgot sexy  and there are plenty of women who live indiana jones for his sex appeal  dudes dig his swagger and everybody loves the smirk.
@melonie mac go boom  highest score was apparently a 35 .and that was from an  adam post  video titled  test screening disaster  in the thumbnail.
the test audiences didn t work  do it again but get me more blind and deaf people!!! -kathleen kennedy
from what I heard  from the director in a statement  there have been zero test screenings.but youtubers are still falling over themselves to report this nonsense.
@eddyk  its a stupid idea and this film will tank. guys already know what s coming  indiana jones will be a bumbling buffoon of an old man and his daughter will be a mary sue who does everything right the first time. so men aren t going to go  and women dont like to pay for anything so there goes the couples audience.
@eddyk  funny that....  kevin smith  called  clownfish tv  a bunch of liars when they reported about some rumours  yet they were telling the truth and he lost his cred. nerdrotic  has reported on rumours  only to be accused of lying only to have it turn out he was correct.ditto for  george the giant slayer .so why should we believe this director when his peers have been telling tall tales and this reeks more of damage control.
@samphadha vihara  doomcock was talking about this for some time now  we knew what these people are doing.
exactly sam exactly!!!!!! harrison aged out of the roll years before crystal skull.  if they wanted to do a pass on the legacy film they needed to have done that about 8 to 10 years after the last crusade.  this would be a terrible premise for a new film just another bait and switch.  if they wanted to do another film go backwards and recast before the lost ark but those are damn hard shoes to fill you better nail that film.  I cant imagine it being done in this day in age with these writers.
its just so frustrating to be able to come up with a better story idea in like five seconds  than modern hollywood can with millions of dollars to pay  professional  writers. the entertainment industry is suffering death by committee due to agenda driven hacks.
love the idea. I d watch that movie
@figaro fruitjuice  right  to me  I think that would have a ton of opportunities for cool sequences and quality plot. oh well.
I remember that.  it wasn t bad.
I remember thatshow. back then  I was 7 yrs old when it premiered in my country. tia carerre is one of my 90s tv crush
that was classic 90s tv but I dont remember it being particullary good
I am re-watching it now.
Im pretty sure ford insisted on solo dying as a condition for returning to that franchise.  he thought the character should have died at the end of the empire strikes back.
@bryan correll    ford  thought the character should have died at the end of the empire strikes back .  someone remind me  how many authorial credits does ford have on hit movies or books   maybe the actors should stick to  acting .  or in ford s case carpentry and sucking at flying.
fleabag. I thought I recognized her from somewhere. yeah she s no indy
solo and fleabag  one was meh  the other I haven t heard of. I think perhaps she s in over her head.
ford always hated star wars and solo. his death was one of the requirements for him to agree to the film. it isn t the death that bothered me  but the manner of death.
@bryan correll  Im pretty sure this is the case. I didn t like it  but it was better than not getting harrison back to reprise the role.
a lot of business deals are done on that casting couch
@chaosinfusion  was it  did we really need him to show up   give a few memberberry lines and then get killed by his son  tfa made him into a loser. literally  he lost his family  his falcon  shoot his wife even took his rank. youreally think that was necessary
in other words  doomcock was right!
@crimson mist  I d say so and add another franchise killed by kk
@thisguydan  sadly thats one of the few things he hasn t got right.
thats pretty cool.he leads a field trip and somehow gets pulled into mystery and intrigue with his students tagging along  maybe an old foe appears to derail the field trip
actually  thats not bad. I can see a lot of potential in thatset up.
so basically the new chick is indy and can go through the raiders story for the first time and have a relationship with marion. classy.
@mike rosoft  not even that  its worse. when young indy and old indy dying together messes with time and causality. meaning it wipes out the original movies and has her being indy the whole time. doing what kk wants to do  destroying another male character saying he never did it it was always a woman.
the current crop of  writers  only know about  cliff s notes.
raiders of the lost arse.
yay!! its so good to see melonie back. love the hoodie
I dont know how they would have merged the two  considering the differing time periods  but its a shame we never got an indiana   lara crossover. of course  the time to do that would have been 20 years ago  when lara croft was still very much lara croft  rather than an endlessly traumatized ironing board  and when harrison ford was merely old  rather than cadaverous.
I heard that there s a lot of issues behind the scenes with this movie more than what they re letting on and it might not go to theaters it might go straight to disney plus
sallah being in the film is the first good thing Ive heard about it. so Im guessing waller-bridge s character will be the daughter of shia lebeouf s character  or are they gonna create some other child of indiana that will happen to be dead or something
movie begins with a young woman somewhat familiar to us grabbing something ancient from somewhere ancient. as she solves the final puzzle and grips the  sacred jewel of woke agenda  in her hand she mutters  I got it father  Im a jones after all . our hero pulls a map from her bag making a large circle around a steep fiery mountain labeled mount doom. with gem griped tightly in her palm our hero releases a deep sigh  clasping the jewel firmly to her breast she says  finally we can end this  were so close . our hero then leaps forward swiftly back down the hall from which she came escaping through the tall green brush into the cruel  jungle of mysteries
I cant believe how creatively bankrupt hollywood is that now gender race sexuality swapping and copy pasting beloved franchises is their one trick and it fails everytime. also melonie I love your hoodie and where can I get one
the actress that played cypher from the fast and furious saga did pretty well in her first appearance   made me think she could be the better lara croft than what we have now  cause she reminds me a lot of how angelina did for the role
imagine choosing your ending by focus group instead of just being a good writer and writing a good ending...
didn t lara become immortal due to some artefact she found so locking her age after that would make sense. magic is weird after all and doesnt confirm to the rules of physics.also you forgot the character of  sydney fox  from the  relic hunter  series  1999-2002  as played by  tia carrere  as another female archeologist option  and yay  she s biracial asian as well. more diversity check marks.  .but jests aside she could ve been another option.as for indy a  retirement of the ip is an option.b  reboot.c  do some post ij4 movies with sean patrick flanery  as he did do the  young indiana jones  series and tv movies  so he s not exactly new to the series or the role.d  pull a multiverse and have the younger indy dragged from his home universe to replace the old one.  mystical artefact activated by him being murdered  with younger indy having to solve who killed his counterpart and stop them doing whatever and dooming the world  maybe they re trying to timetravel.   and having to settle into a time well beyond his time.picture an indy from the 1930s having to adapt to the  80s or  90s.. culture shock anyone but yeah  this isn t one of those franchises where you can really do a change of the guard.at best you can do a spin-off and him giving his blessing to his favourite student and passing on his m1911 to them.  more practical gift than the hat or whip.  indy has used two guns consistently through his career. a webley .455  dont recall which model  but a mk v or vI is likely. and the m1911  as the webley was discontinued and getting ammo for it a pita. india is the only place thatstill makes earlier black powder versions. so switching to the more common .45 acp makes sense. but yeah  making someone else other than henry jones jr. assume the moniker of indiana jones is just asking to tank the ip.you d think they d have learned their lessons with rey  skywalker  palpatine. typo fix
Imean  the second I heard waller-bridge was cast for the movie  I knew she d replace indy. at this rate  you can just predict what they ll do.
I think they should had made more films back when he was young in the 90 s at least. itshouldn t had taken them this long to get a new film out
I guess relic hunter didn t have enough name recognition from its 3 seasons.  which ironically was inspired by tomb raider s success.  or maybe disney didn t have any rights to the name..
I really like harrison ford in first indiana jones movie through the fourth movie bc I thought he was just a great actor to play the part of the movie series. anyway I am so sad and upset that they got a woman to play his part in the fifth movie series and I am hoping that the movie company will let harrison ford finish playing his acting role in the fifth movie series to let the new female actress to start playing his role in the indiana jones movie in future. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout this topic of this video and I just wanted to tell you that you are doing a fantastic job with making videos like this every day and I just wanted to tell you that to keep it up and I am so happy for you for doing something that you love to do for your fans. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and I hope you had a wonderful and great blessed weekend with your parents and I hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening with your parents and your pets and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed week this week too melonie. anyway God bless you and God bless your hard work that you do for your fans. anyway have a great day melonie.
thank you for making this. indy has been my hero forever and this truly shatters me.
Ive heard some folks speculate that kathleen kennedy is self-inserting herself into all of george s old properties to take them over. thats why all the lucas film movies lately have a brunette mary sue taking over as the star. Ive heard on this one specifically that there is some sort of time-travel bs and she takes over for indy as a reboot. its a doomcock rumor though so...anyway  great video melonie. I ll let disney crash indy and hope thatsomeone with talent picks up lara and makes a good movie there.
to quote spongebob   how many times do we have to teach you this lesson  old man!!!!!!
hm  well there s three things that I think might be a problem. 1 is that we already have a famous archeologist adventurer in lara croft  so just do that. 2 is thatshe is an unknown character being brought in specifically to replace him. for captain america  for example  he passed on the mantle to someone who was there with him along for the ride  fighting alongside him and earning that title. so for me it made sense in the narrative compared to just handing a  nobody  character that title. 3 is that because she is a woman  I can already see the plot making him a bumbling idiot or just an old fool while she does everything perfectly without even trying. like how they made nick fury a side character relegated to the  comedic relief  role while the untouchable female protagonist has to do all the work. a lot of these  writers  nowadays have to take a sledge hammer to the classic icons because otherwise their pale imitations wont measure up to anything.
I have friends that didn t get that wokeness killed tomb raider  marvel  and star wars I wish I could force them to watch you and others that can point it out clearly because I just get flustered. thanks for all the work you put into your videos.
I cant believe harrison ford is 80 years old and he may not be around much longer. Imean he s indiana jones and freaking han solo! 2 legendary characters that many ppl like me grew up with and love. whatever they do I just hope they pay respect to the legend of mr. ford...
first off love the sweater melonie.  its cold as crap up here in the nw.  looks great on you.  my feelings on indiana jones are a little bit too little too late.  if they were going to go with a daughter for indiana jones storyline or an apprentice to indy they should have built that up about 25 years ago as a young girl or teenager about 10 years after the last crusade.  harrison ford is too old now.  he was too old in the crystal skull which was terrible.  if they wanted to pass down the legacy like say creed in the rocky movies lucas needed to have done thatsooner before the actor has aged out of the role.  Imean I dont buy indy at 65 years old punching a guy in the face with no major pain and arthritis.  he should be doing things smarter or outsmarting his opponents without using a lot of force because as an older man you cant take that kind of action movie punishment and still have it be believable.  your suspension of disbelief only goes so far.  what was great about indy in the past movies is that he felt pain  made mistakes and was more of an everyday man hero not a superhero.  they haven t built a montage of indy showing her how to do things.  like in the 1st movie indy learned from marrion s dad.  they wont do the groundwork to make the movie work within the story.  show her going on adventures with indy really learning how to do archeology.  you can buy thatstory and make it work but really have to do the legwork on the story you cant bait and switch and expect the audience to give a shit.  you are spot on that the only way to really continue would be to recast and go with a younger indiana jones prequel before the events of the lost ark.  going after other special historical artifacts from real history.
who knows
I even wear his hat
well doomcock broke the news on this rumor first  so I d give him some credit
as soon as kennedy started wearing a tshirt thatsays  the force is female   I knew it was going to be race to the bottom at lucasfilm.the one truly redeeming thing that has come out is andor.
I have a theory - kk having worked with spielberg and george for many many years  has a massive chip on her shoulder as a result of issues she had with them during that period. maybe they never asked her what she thought  maybe they dismissed every idea she ever had  maybe they even used an idea or two of hers but never gave her credit. but she bided her time  held her tongue  said  yes george  yes steven  whenever she had to. and so they thought   she gets it  she has the experience  and george finally gave her the job. gave her the chance to fling mud in their eyes until the end of time.... of course  the other theory is that  like 99  of new current hollywood writers  she hasn t got a clue what makes a good story  so she falls back on identity politics just to have something to put in a film.... kk   oh shit  what are we going to do with indy this time ! he s already beaten the nazis  the soviets and some pagan cult  not that we could do that one again anyway cos that would be _racist_!  ....also kk   oh! I know! let s replace indy with a woman! that ll be a good story! and intersectional feminism is hot in hollywood right now  we wanna keep riding that hype train yeah! .
personally I dont mind  passing the tourch  kind of films  they did it with ghost busters which was really good not the female one  the recent one  and I remember a cartoon from my childhood about james bond jr which was fantastic so in priniciple it can be really good but its all depending on the script  cast and director to pull it off. as for lara croft I dont know how well the third movie performed but I guess it didn t do too well since any talks about a sequel no longer exist so I guess as far as movies go the franchise is seen as unprofitable although they can definitely can make a kick ass 10 10 tr movie  you just need the right people.
I dont think they would replace ford  especially since someone like james mangold is directing and writing the movie. he has a massive respect for the characters he writes and directs onscreen. his previous movies are proof of that.
we need a melanie mac go boom action figure
what happened to indiana jones s son  its been awhile since I seen him but he was a failed version of him but he was a thing. would like to see him develop into a decent replacement to his father. you made a good point in mentioning laura croft as the female equivalent to indiana jones.
does this mean we can have a larry croft
why not just do a short round spinoff series on disney plus starring ke huy quan and call it a day  I would watch the hell out of thatshow.
a lot of thatsounded eerily similar to the things said about the recent  he-man  show prior to release.
female archaeologist with skills  attitude  strength  sass  and beauty .  relic hunter
apparently  bob chapek saw a screening of indie 5 and was pissed  saying kk was given a year and millions more to fix indy 5 and it was still shit. bc also reminded kk that her deal was thatshe stay on until the project is finished. apparently  it got personal  kk was shaking  and chapeck may have said something to the effect of  prepare for a summer departure .
Im going to think about this every time a woman asks me to open a jar.
this is going to be a train wreck. indiana regularly fights dirty  gets punched  makes mistakes  etc. hollywood doesnt let any of that happen with female characters.with her leading the franchise  I d bet anything she becomes a mary sue of unbelievable ridiculousness that is instantly amazing at everything.
if they wanted to keep the movies going they already revealed in kingdom of the crystal skulls that indiana jones has a son also called henry jones jr or jr jr  henry jones iiI  as indy was henry jones jr and his son is named after him it was even teased at the end when the son was going to pick up indy s hat but at the last moment it was taken by indy. I know there is already a series called indiana jones jr based on young indiana jones but that is basically who the son technically is the next indiana jones jr
yeah  wasn t indiana jones replaced by  lara croft  or something   lara croft played by a digital clone of rodney dangerfield  I believe
I dont think the studio really understood james mangold when he had a beautiful send off for logan while x-23 in a way replaces him but honors his legacy. I think they re trying to do the same thing with this but they probably dont have a lot of faith in him.
I love that you have all of those lara croft figurines. I have pretty much all of them too.
go follow doomcock. he has been following this project since 2018 when it was announced. mangold called him out cause he called it about the internal test screenings and with 6 different ending. all  of which  ended with phoebe wearing the fedora and the bull whip.
you got my sub today. watched a few vids and I like your take on things. I really dont like the idea of making indiana jones without a reboot with a new actor. is this woman a professor  does she embody any of the archetypical traits that we love about indy  I doubt it. its going to suck
the think  is that in the 4 film they introduces already his son  as future main roll  but yeah...also 37 ufff as successor.. a bit old for carrying a franchise a new.. because here she get introduces thats mean she might be already in here 40 for the first standalone as main.
the best way to keep the franchise alive is to change formats. instead of a blockbuster movie where everyone is expecting harrison ford do a six episode miniseries with a new younger actor  chris pratt can probably do a good indiana jones or someone like that. if the show is successful then transfer that actor to a blockbuster movie and the transition would be more seamless. people still might not accept the new indiana jones actor but at least he would be more acclimated through the tv shows.
indiana jones  harrison ford  could meet and interact with lara croft  angelina jolie . indiana and lara could both discover the same portal gate in each of their own time periods. when they activate it from each side  it then becomes a stable time bridge. then they could cross over into the other s time period. for indiana jones to experience culture shock in today s world would be hilarious!
I actually liked thatshow
make this happen
especially the vehement denials by the director.  we ve all seen this one act play before.

did you just have a fever dream  bro
I believe you believe that  after the choice of not wanting to believe the actualgarbage forced down my cake hole...dangerfield is what it was  yes.

they will have to change the name.  indiana is his name.  she could carry the last name.  so this will have to be the last one with the name.  if they have started off like the uncharted series with nathan drake this would not be as awkward as the follow-on was with the women in the lost legacy.  if they want to carry the indiana name they could make a prequel like was done in star wars with some young actor like alden ehrenreich who played young han solo.  phoebe waller-bridge was in that movie as bot l3-37.  despite the movie failure I liked it.  he effectively captured han s mannerisms.
I could have sworn harrison ford said in an interview   when I die  indiana jones dies with me. there will be no other
this was already done  the actress  tia carrere  I believe the show was a tv series I think iit was called relic hunter.
the old indiana jones movies didn t have his name in the title   raiders of the lost ark   not  indiana jones and the raiders of the lost ark  etc.   so if this possible spin-off can stand on its on two feet then fine. but I fear they have no courage for that.
the indiana jones moves  as well the james bond movies  were catering to  male fantasies   where the overwhelmingly male teenager viewership of those movies could have a good escapist time. the relatable male hero goes to exotic places to find the treasure  defeat the evil  save the girl and gets the girl in a time-period where it made sense  late 1930 s . back then when the first tomb raider came out I thought it was an indiana jones rip-of with a female protagonist. but the more I thought about the  female indy in a pc game   it made more and more sense. it was better to have a well formed female a   on the center of the screen for the overwhelmingly male teenager gaming community than a ww2 are army officer pants indy worn in the movies. the perspective was different for the same escapist fun. the gamer  had  the girl trough the whole game  check! . the gamer just needed the treasure hunt  defeat evil part.when movie studios tried to make a movie out of tomb raider  it did not work. not even angelina jolie in her prime could make it work. because overwhelmingly male teenager viewership could  not relate to the character in a movie format. the heroic  saving the girl  part was missing from the fantasy.indy 4 got smashed for many different reasons  but deep down the biggest issue of the big fans of the original trilogy  who used to be teenage boys by the time those movies came out  was  that they can not relate anymore to the  old  indy who does not  get the girl  anymore  instead gets  married with a kid  and the time period for exotic adventure had passed in the mid 50 s.I simply cant see indy 5 working in any way  especially when fades between indy 4 and the tomb raider movie adaptation possibly somewhere in the 1960 s.
I am going to see this movie  because its indiana jones. he was the initial primer into my intrigue for these movies--as well as developing a keen interest in world history and archaeology. I am not getting my hopes up and I am keeping my expectations very low. I hate that these beloved stories have to be modified for a  modern audience  or that there has to be so much changed just to save face. I grew up with these movies and I still say that last crusade was the last  best  indy film.
Ive said this before  I rather had mutt  shia labouf  from kingdom of the crystal skull to replace indiana jonesmy other choice is do a recast   made it a follow-up to the last crusade   let just say after he drink water from the holy grail it give him a supernatural power making him ageless
37 ! ! playing his grand daughter   wtf wouldn t it be smarter to get a woman in her 20s that can actually stand as a new face for longer  37 years old  that lady has like 3 more years before she gets wrinkley  she already looks rough
they already have the perfect ending for the franchise. thats where him and his father run off into the sunset in the last crusade. thats where it ended and thats it.
we already have a female indiana jones in relic hunter and tomb raider.
would you do a reaction of the erb between indiana jones and lara croft just wasn t sure if its the content you would be interested in doing  but I figured the matter of the video would be fun for you. if not its fine  just inquiring
before watching this Im really excited to hear her give credit to doomcock lol he s leaked this information for more than a year now
has someone actually seen a test screening of  indiana jane and the wayback machine   do tell us more!
we all know its impossible to write compelling new series cough avatar cough the expanse cough  or continue an old franchise well cough cobra kaI  cough . it just cant be done.
sometimes it feels hollywood is just trolling you specifically  melonie!
you are my spirit animal. keep up the great work girly.
there were rumours wayback that just after the disastrous 4th movie came out  that apparently megan fox was going to play the next indiana jones or his daughter and that was along time ago. but of course in today s world wamen can do everything better than men so Im not surprised.
it ll finish up like the new wahmen strong pirates of the caribbean - on the cutting room floor.
one of my favorite characters in general is beatrix from kill bill.
the actress is a bit old to play his granddaughter with him at 80. consider that his character was born in the 19th century. I would think that the granddaughter would be in her late teens early 20s based upon his age  since his character was in his late 30s early 40s when his son was born.the story would have to take place in the late 70s early 80s.
true  but that was more or less an original-ish character  clearly based off of tomb raider and indiana jones.
@knytrydr73  haha my bad  I didn t realize that. I thought she was supposed to be a female indy.
it does feel like that
what if this granddaughter of indie s met lara croft and they teamed up to stop some giant cobras or something
thank God. here I thought we were going to run out of cringe material for melonie to talk about. suddenly a new contender is about to waltz into the arena. they will have to have grit and determination. because the regining champion of cringe is rings of power.
I heard they were going to literally make indies granddaughter lara croft  and combine the two universes.
the messed up part is these actresses who take these roles are and could be some of the most talented in the industry but because of idiot directors they take heat from fans who already spent years attaching to   a well established person in that universe.
omg! a ren h ek sweatshirt  I want this!  d
so the idea of her being his granddaughter makes zero since timeline wise if its to be set in the 60 s  as far as we know the only kid indy had was mutt  and when we meet mutt in crystal skull in 1957 he s only 18 maybe 19 years old  there s no way unless they re planning to retcon on another surprise kid off screen
kathleen kennedy is like the terminator.   she cant be bargained with.  she cant be reasoned with. she doesnt feel pity or remorse.  or fear and she absolutely will not stop  ever  until every lusasfilm franchise we loved growing up is dead.
yep not looking forward to this at all. indy ended for me after the last crusade. love your hoodie! 90 s nickelodeon was the best!
didn t indiana jones have a son in the crystal skull  what happened to him  he would make a good replacement and it would feel more natural.
well  there is already a  female indiana jones .and her name is lara croft  and she haven t been written properly after the second reboot.
to be fair  I d watch the hell out of melonie mac as indiana jones
this was basically a foregone conclusion at this point. there s no way a company disney doesnt try to suck all the money it can out of the indiana jones name before abandoning it as a lifeless shell of its former glory. but they cant recast  because harrison ford is indiana jones  and literally everyone would all rightly be mad. they cant do a prequel  unless its like the rumored abner ravenwood series and doesnt have indy in it  because young indiana jones already was a prequel and is beloved in its own right  and we d all rightly be mad. so they ll do what they always do  replace a classic character with a boring  obnoxious british woman. we ll still all rightly be mad  but they ll get endless praise from the soulless mainstream  critics  and a few weirdos on twitter  and a few dollars  at first  from people with no discernment  so they ll double down. but they ll never let indy rest as long as there s a few bucks to be drained out of using his name. would much rather see a new character in the style of indy  like lara croft was when she was first dreamed up in the 90s.
if they do this  they better call her movie franchise indi-anna
what s hilarious is that doomcock broke this story a little while ago  and kk got big mad because of the leaks lol
its already funny when you title your 3rd film   the last crusade   which I understand could somewhat be construed as a play on words   then knock out a nearly unwatchable sequel
omg your hoodie is pure fire! I heard about this rumor awhile back and in the current  bait and switch  era I knew this was gonna happen...
2008 interview with harrison ford   what do you mean  give it to shia   its mine!  which was ford s response to the interviewer s question. I d be shocked if he gives his role to whoever. he ll forever be indy  and he ll take the role with him to his grave. haha
can we call it  indiana jones and the hot flashes of doom    can we   can we please
another amazing movie im excited and hyped to let it go broke!
lara was based on indy like other game characters  just she took the modern approach where he fights nazis  p
you know who would be even better  short round from part 2 and he could make it more than just a simple replacement
yeah  but his son is shaiah labouf
@stuart crippen  ya I know  but his character wasn t like indy. short round I can believe goin on adventures  shia not so much
isn t this the one where they say she goes back in time and erases him from existence or something
I can already see the cast and studio blaming the audience for the low ratings due to  reasons
weird article. john rhy-davies was in 2 of the 4 previous films.
Imean  it worked so well for james bond...
I want to thank hollywood for saving me a small fortune in movie tickets. you keep churning out crap and I ll keep saving. thank you!
the only reason I play the reboot tr games is because of the gameplay its satisfying to me nd I have fun with it on that front never got into tr before at the time wasn t the kind of games I would play gameplay wise but that was then now its different  way more into jrpgs than I was then
on the subject of lara croft  how would you feel if they brought angelina back
indiana jones and the crystal skull was supposed to be the harrison ford dr jones send off right
melonie you would make the perfect lara croft in a movie. you look just like her
first 10 seconds of this video and I saw a little sass and bitterness. I would take this personally too
Im gonna wait to see the movie for myself cause to be honest  I dont completely believe these rumors if only because harrison himself has said multiple times that he does not want the character to be recast  even going as far as saying  when Im gone  he s gone   I wouldn t be surprised if the dude tries to put it in his will or something  and he obviously has a lot of fondness for the character  at least more so then he does for han solo  so I cant see him being okay with this. Im also not against indy dying as long as its done well and with respect. that being said  I would not be surprised at all if disney is trying to pull a  but see we re not technically recasting indiana jones because she s technically a completely different character.  that  I could definitely see them doing and yes  that would be annoying. its also not uncommon for movies to have screenings before they re completely finished  so part of me does think the director is trying to save face. why the hell else would they be shooting multiple endings  and that in and of itself scares me a bit cause Ive learned that movies that need multiple endings shot are usually either under some sort of control by the studio or are having trouble with the story. I know a lot of the leaks seem to have been legit as well so  guess we ll have to wait and see.
having indy die is breaking so much canon.  during the young indiana jones chronicles it literally had him living to be like a 100.
what ever happened to the transformer movie guy  I thought he was going to take  over the role as his son.
I think chris pratt could have been an amazing recast for indi
didn t they do a pass the torch in the crystal skull already  his son
harrison ford likes doing his own stunts  and we ll see how many of us look that good at 80.
the director of the franchise james mangold has said recently that phoebe waller-bridge isn t replacing harrison ford so indy is safe for now but time will tell given this is disney we re talking about and they re the ones who decided to green litshe-hulk but for now ford and indiana jones are t going anywhere anytime soon. thank goodness.
doomcock has being covering this since april
didn t kingdom of the crystal skull already bring in a new indianna jones  hell this movie should bring back the greatest character from temple of doom short round!
reads the byline.  this isn t going to end well.
hang-on did kathleen kennedy steal the plot of the terminator  or somethin !
that d be the dream! a mature lara croft adventure with the one and only irl lara croft  sign me up!
actually  they should pass the lara croft torch on to youtube creator  twitch streamer and video game developer lana lux. look her up. they could be sisters.
@hiraghm  - wow. she really looks like jolie!
@melonie mac go boom  - she could definitely pull off one more tomb raider film. jolie was one of the only things I like about the eternals and she was still kicking some ass in that movie.
@melonie mac go boom
there wont be any canon if indy goes back in time and dies along with his younger self. everything will be reversed and a female indy will take over.
they can just retcon that like the young indiana jones never happened or change his indy age to 80s during thatshow.
there s also evelyn from the mummy  there s obviously been good characters before  just hollywood has been killing them
new video!! I love that hoodie  melonie. ren and stimpy were the best.
a topic about archeology.melonie  I sense some blood.
he s basically the crypt keeper at this point so he definitely needs to be replaced by someone
fans  cries about content not being good enough and how disney marvel insert company here is ruining their childhoodalso fans  proceeds to buy tickets to the next movie and continues to consume product
its not just about riding the coattails of already successful franchises or simply destroying a male character everyone likes  though that is part of it . the fact is  they know damn well that their ideas aren t popular and that anything new they made would be a failure. in order to push their bs  they literally have no choice but to use pre-established franchises or else no one will even bother watching it and their ideas wont spread.
I d rather they didn t kill off indy  but I d be ok with it if the execution is well done and as long as his past remains intact. if they have helena go back in time to redo indy s past in order to change history  that would be embarrassing lol. james mangold says that this wont happen though  so either he s lying or the other leaks are a lie. time will tell.
maybe they ll get kevin hart to play lara croft next.
at least  at least   they re trying to figure out a way to  smoothly and respectfully   get rid of indiana and introduce his granddaughter. its kind of a good sign  isn t it  right  no
we allready have a female indy and shes called marion ravenwood
I dont understand how they cantry to justify making this indiana jones s granddaughter considering the actress playing the character is one year older than shia labeouf who played the son of indiana jones.
for me  the core made og lara was woke  no men  knew everything  did everything- had all answers... she just wasn t a person but a mary sue. the current rise and shadow of the tomb raider the 3rd era of her is more believable  she has friends  help  is struggling in the first one in 3e to get through- much more human and relatable than the pre-cd version for me
so now we have diana jones  and tom braider
sad part about lara getting rebooted is that rise of the tomb raider is actually a damn good game that I have played through many times and it holds up. solid game with excellent dlc as well. it also probably has the only decent story of the three reboot era entries. but that in no way makes lara herself  interesting. she s the worst aspect of all three games as she wheezes and huffs her way through every situation moaning about her fecking dad. hell  not gonna lie. her friend jonah is a far more compelling character and he s the fecking side kick!
nooo  why !  I am getting the same vibes as you with the pushed wokeness and pushed female leads nowadays that no one asked for  melonie. just finished watching warrior nun season two and two nuns kiss is was like what !  why !  it doesnt push the story forward and its an insult to the church  and the vatican
I think the biggest problem with modern movies is  when they began calling them  franchises  ...they are not franchises  they are an idea  a story someone once had to tell.mcdonalds is a  franchise
indy puts his hat on a new female indy and says... I like this one!
hello melonie I absolutely  youroutfit today.give me freaking break they have replaced harrison fordfor woman taking his place.I seriously hate these big companies keepalways wanting to keep reduing movies that have already made their spot in history.melonie for bringing this topic up they should just left it alone like where they ended.takecare melonie your the best
I dont need more indy. the 3 original movies made a great trilogy for the character. thatsaid  I remember enjoying the young indiana show  so I think  as much as prequals have sucked   a movie or show reboot of that would be the best opportunity for good storytelling. you know  if they had competent people working on it.
I know that there are lots of different intelligent species in the star wars universe  but a spider jedI sounds . you cant even run out the house and then burn it down cuz it can just force pull you back in.
I think we all secretly wanted chris pratt to play indie
ahh  I forgot there was another of my favourite characters were out there to ruin
how would she be related to henry  sister  cousin  maybe daughter
why dont they just pick up the story where the crystal skull left off  indy has a son in crystal skull right  played by shia  Jesus. btw nice shirt melonie. cute
I feel like they already have a woman in indiana jones. laura croft
thats an awesome hoodie! and your hair looks fantastic. and you have pretty eyes. and your smile brightens the darkest days
regardless of whether they replace indy  the fact that they are spamming endings at test audiences indicates that they dont actually have a decent plan for a story.
reboot it with the guy from age of adeline who played a young harrison ford
the rumours others have said  doomcock especially  have them with 3 endings  in all of which old indie and pwb went back in time and met younger indie. in one  they had both indys died   ad pwb taking the hat and becoming indiana jones moving forward. in other words  all canon would be pwb doing everything through all existing movies  not ford s character.thatsounds extreme though. not sure Im buying it. but if true  yikes!
female indiana jones   relic hunters  with tia carrere  great old series.
I want to say that this is not the worst of ideas... Im not against women being cool and kicking ass. its just I hope thatshe doesnt do at the expense of men. especially if she s good at using whips eyebrows going up  n  down  d
I thought shia le buff or whatever was already setup as his replacement
and I was hoping they give us a carmen sandiego movie before I croak.
in the case of harrison ford as indy I dont know... he is very old now and if you want to continue the franchise in some way he has to be replaced eventually. I think itshould be again a male lead but  well  maybe they want a woman lead now. but I think too that they just let it go. but this is obviously impossible when mr. greed kicks in the door.
im guessing the ending will be that phoebe is belloqs grand daughter and after some timey wimey bs jones is killed and she takes his name.
ok  melonie  I have to disagree on this one. at the very least  it is too early to say whether passing the baton to a hypothetical female jones relative will or will not work. unlike the lara croft reboot  it will be a new character. I agree 100  that a lara croft movie showcasing classic lara would be most welcome  but thats not what this is. if fact we haven t seen her story yet. the only mistake at this stage imo is leaking her existence and hinting at continuing the series with a new lead before the film s release. if she s a great character  a spin-off franchise will be organic because fans will want it.  and if not  they cant take last crusade away from us. if anything  lara is an indiana jones rip-off  albeit a highly successful one  so unless the producers have indy s niece    running around in an aqua tank with shorts and combat boots  a braid  dual pistols  and sporting a british accent  its not really fair to call this a tomb raider rip-off.we shall see. I just want a great film to cap off one of my favorite movie franchises of all time.
I dont mind women in action roles.  alias and buffy are 2 of my fav shows ever. aliens is one of my fav movies ever. but they were great stories with great characters.
could use adam driver as his son
melonie! ren and stimpy!  I love it!
in indiana jone 4 they tried replacing harrison ford with shia labeouf
chris pratt or chris pine
youre so kind  thank you
that. sounds. terrible.
another movie I will retcon myself and pretend doesnt exist
the last crusade had the only send off I need to end the series.
doomcock has talked about this in depth from many sources.... in all 6 endings fleabag takes the hat and whip that where tested in several of them india dies or young india dies there is a big time travel plot involving in erasing or killing india in every version.... disney  has already announced a tv series in development thatstarts at the end of this movie.... so its more hot garbage from your friends at disney
already done  female indiana jones   lara croft tomb raider
couldn t agree more about the tomb raider. what was wrong with the original lara croft  well traveled  debonair  wealthy  athletic. we should all aspire to be that.the new ones made me feel like I was watching someone s torture porn slash fic or whatever.even the movies with angelina jolie were closer to the idea.
jj swore to the moon and back before star trek  into darkness released that cumberbatch wasn t kahn. low and behold  once we saw the movie  kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahn!
indy jones crossover with lara croft and springboard lara to a reboot of new adventures.sounds better already as an indy send off while passing the bullwhip to a worthy successor .make it a tom cruise production too.
have you made a video about this sbf ftx insanity
indiana joanna coming to theaters near you.
if I wanted to continue indiana jones I would just make a new character like his grandson or whatever and do something new  a new saga based on this new character. there is no way they will do something good these days.
in the thumbnail I thought shes wearing a dress with flowers like elderly women do
if they do the send off like wolverine s rather than han solo s that would be great.  I really thought they were gonna replace him with shia labeouf that last time...
you cant argue semantics with the  woke . there are still crazies thatsay kevin smith didn t sideline he-man  he was dead. lmao... good vid melonie
hollywood simply cannot learn from their mistakes  because they refuse to admit they ve made any.
its disney  they ll never let anything sleep in peace
on a similar note is the female-led national treasure series
melanie must have finally got cold  she had to break out the hoodie. this actress is another kathleen kennedy self-insert  like rey in  the force awakens.  kk will absolutely try to replace indiana jones with a female  rumors are that phoebe waller-bridge retroactively replaces ford s indiana jones using time-travel shenanigans  as if she was the only ever indiana jones erasing the male indy from history.
we already have a female indiana jones  its called tomb raider.   so will there be a male tomb raider  oh wait  we have that too with uncharted!
they already have a female version of indiana jones her name is tomb raider lol
as bad as the kingdom of the crystal skull was   although comparable to the movies today its a masterpiece  the end of that movie had shia labeouf pick up indie s hat and ford whipped it outta his hand instantly  theater cheered.  not one single person would cheer or want a continuation without ford attached to it.
cold snap in texas I take it. how did I know you would have a lara croft shout out.
sounds awful
I think that was the original plan  but indy 4 didn t work out so that killed the replacement idea.
if this happens to be all true  then its this type of storytelling that is now becoming a sad  unintentional parody.  and as I shared with others  Im all for empowerment but I  and many  many moviegoers  are tired of shoehorning it to death and to the detriment of beloved franchises. these film makers and activist writers and producers live in such a bubble and act as if this is demanded and something new and revolutionary when we can go back throughout cinema history and see originally written  strong female characters portrayed so well in many different film genres. now  its this lazy  woke as hell push to replace prominent male characters heroes with women instead of writing new interesting characters for women who can stand on their own two legs. lora croft is a perfect example. and rather than allowing indy to go off into the sunset as a legendary hero  he might die off and be replaced by a woman  and they believe this is what men and women want to see and experience    they are oblivious. so if the storyline rumors are true  test screening or not  then itsounds like disney is on a course to destroying yet another beloved franchise unless  and hopefully  they can do major damage control between now and its release.  thatsaid  I really hope none of this is true and mangold s statement isn t just lip service like the one kevin smith gave for his lousy he-man cartoon.
we dont need another indiana jones to be honest... the trilogy was perfect.
get ready for indiana jane! haha
this one pisses me off  I grew up with indiana jones  read the novelization  saw every adaptation in tv series format. indiana jones is a man  simple as that. my best memories involved seeing indiana jones the last crusade with my deceased best friend grandfather. honor the character or do not make the movie at all. rant over  catching my digital breath now.
next  they gonna make female jack sparrow for next potc.
I think after the failure of the uncharted movie indiana jones 5 may be the closest to a tomb raider sequel you ll get.
imagine if disney went back to their roots  just beautifully hand drawn fairy tales
indiana jones is my lara and has been since my dad took me to see raiders at the drive-in. this is not made for og fans like me. this is just kathleen kennedy ruining another franchise. rip and hard pass
ke huy quan is acting again. they should do a spinoff movie or something.
I also thought about lara when I saw it  lol. and now  an indiana jones franchise... without indie. cool. it would be cool if they just finished the franchise. in a good way  of course.
they should ve reinvented the formula for indiana jones movies if they wanted to do more films with an aged harrison ford  some of the best star trek films are not dependent on physically demanding violent action sequences to be entertaining.
Im starting to get the impression thatshe likes lara croft.
lara croft could save indy s life! if sony sued disney for copyright infringement if ms. indy takes over and gets an injunction against the film being released! save us lara  youre our only hope!
now my indianaconda dont want none.
I always liked relic hunter  wonder why they dont reboot that instead of indian jones
mel mel its allllllll about replacing the male counterparts so that we can have  strunk  women. theres a saying Imade up a few days ago.  no men get recasted unless first castrated but regardless this is dead on arrival. and yeah but your video is great and we already have the blueprint. should have been tomb raider
cant wait for larry croft in tomb raider
step 1  tell men that they are all bad people at the most fundamental level.step 2  replace men in all of their movies with female characters who embody those exact same manly traits.step 3  remind men how bad they are so they cant make any new ips or characters unless they re feminine approved.step 4  wonder where all the  real men  are.
hasn t that already been done with tomb raider
didn t harrison ford give his hat to shia labeouf in the last movie
if they were going to replace indiana  they had the perfect opportunity in indy 4 with his son played by shia labeouf. they even teased it. or ya know  maybe just end the series with indy  and stop milking franchises until they become shells of themselves
I would rather have kI hI quan as the new indiana jones. at least that makes sense.
ford will play lara croft next movie lol
how many esg dollars would you bet on the new female indie needing a  girlfriend  to prop her up to create the illusion of being a strong independent woman
no test screenings lol so why have nearly half a dozen cuts to fall back on if your so confident with your product that you dont test screen  how many directors cuts are they thinking of releasing!
butter does the body good  a stick a day keeps the wrinkles away.
what if they had lara croft pass the mantle over to a new male character their fuzzy little heads would explode I think.
holy cow! last time I saw your subscribers it was at 70k you have really shot up!
not gonna waste a penny on this once great franchise
I know they tried to pass the torch with indy s son in the 4th movie  why dont they bring back shilo and keep working that angle
Im a bit confused by lucas film these days. they act like they weren t breaking barriers 40 years ago. was princess lea not the strongest character in the original trilogy
always have viewed lara as a female indiana jones. now disney owns jones so theyre obviously not gonna make a tomb raider movie but they sure can create something new.
Imiss the real lara
I know that this is an unpopular opinion but they already have a great template for passing the torch to a new character  henry  mutt  jones the third. Imean  you can re-cast the character  we dont necessarily need to have shia lebouf return. I know most everyone has negative feelings about kingdom of the crystal skull  I get it  its not as good as the original trilogy of films but it is still a great film and one to build off of and make a new  inspiring films or even a tv series in the same vein as the young indiana jones series but mutt takes center stage and lets indy retire or work in the background as a more support and mentor kind of character for mutt. that is something I would totally watch and something I would fall in love with  and give me more fodder for my personal fanfiction headcannon too but thats just for my own personal life. Im sorry but indy already has a descendant and I would rather see mutt than a new character  regardless of gender or whatever else. mutt was a good character  not an amazing character like indy or even marion but he was good. crystal skull is actually my favorite film in the series followed by temple of doom  I know unpopular opinion but I will stand by it for all eternity. I apologize if this angers anyone but it is my opinion and I can have my own opinion. thats all Im gonna say. thank you for listening even if you dont agree. oh  also  melonie is an awesome person  I love all the videos Ive watched of hers  and I hope she continues to voice her opinions because she has a right to speak. have a good day night!
if anybody is going to take the mantle from indy itshould be short round. they should ve stopped at the last crusade. it was the perfect ending.
even worse  the first four films were all directed by steven spielberg based on stories by george lucas.  this one spielberg will only be producing and  as near as I cantell  lucas isn t involved at all.now director james mangold has some solid directing credits  logan  3 10 to yuma  walk the line  identity  etc.   but he s not spielberg.this is a movie thatsimply shouldn t have been green lit  especially given the poor reception of crystal skull  which I didn t hate nearly as much as most people seem to  fifteen years ago.  and even then most of the action was handed off to shia laboef  shudder.   an octogenarian indiana jones just reminds me of clint eastwood joking that another  dirty harry  movie would have to be about harry chasing down crooks with a walker.
alien is still the best female lead film. no matter how they try to spin some new film break the chain. that is a no. its alien from the 1980 s era.
this has me convinced that hollywood as a whole  is headlining this push for feminism and replacement of men in every aspect they can. they want it to the point where if you have a favorite franchise or genre you have no choice but to accept the mediocre  rushed  female version who is perfect except for the fact thatshe doesnt realize she s perfect until the end. you want bond  he s a woman now  you want batman  we have batwoman dont worry! king tchalla  we have great value tchalla and his sister! if they re happy to lose money pushing this agenda instead of making good movies Im happy to watch them all burn. there s only so many franchises left to ruin. star wars is gone  marvels on the way down  dc has been failing for a while. I wonder what they ll do when they run out completely.
if kk is actually leaving after indiana jones 5  this will be her biggest fu to fans.
isnt this the reason lara croft is a thing
it can be her son .... larry croft! lmao
problem is that for a bait and switch to be a bait and switch  the target has to not know its exactly that. difference is that  we know exactly what s going on at this point especially after so many times they ve pulled this crap. I dont think this is going to work for them in this case even with a best case scenario. after crystal skull  a lot of people kind of put it down and decided that everything before that mess was all that existed for the series. in every sense this just sounds like a total abomination of a movie and Im fairly sure fans will want no part of this.
I sure hope they dont go that route but woke is still the pipe dream.  hope we get hanna solo from disney
I like to pretend that anything after the third indiana jones movie does not exist its better that way
they need to gracefully wrap up indy s story  not recast him or swap him out especially in the ridiculously rumored  removal  of indiana from history .  have him do one final adventure and retire.  really simple stuff.dont have him hand over his hat or his bullwhip.  let the new character get their own  or have their own type of trademark.  just....mind numbing-ly simple stuff...respect the character  respect the fans of that character.  studios ignore this at their own peril.
another franchise I can pretend ended with the third film.
I hope they wont let indiana jones die.  regarding helena jones stepping into his foot steps  Im somewhat fine with it. not only because I like the actress  but also because they dont reboot indiana jones as eg lindy jones  but respect the aging of the harrison ford and let indiana age.for me indiana jones wouldn t work like james bond with regular recastings. I think continuing the lineage with his grandkid as a good way. and I hugely prefer phoebe waller-bridge over shia lebeouf.
the new film should be called indiana bombs raiders of the lost audience
I called this as soon as 5 was announced. so no surprise
well  to be honest  this indiana jones can be replaced by anyone as far as Im concerned. if she s a better version of lara croft  Im all for it. but I guess she d have to be his daughter to carry the name  jones   unless she pulls a rey and just appropriates the name ... and indy now also having a daughter would feel really weird.in any case - just spare me from seeing shia laboeuf again  please...
indiana jones to be replaced by indiana joan oh  brother!
lara croft as the tomb raider in the games was excellent in its early versions  but I never saw the movie.  I did however watch the somewhat cheesy relic hunter series starring tia carrere on tv twenty or so years ago and found that to be a fun popcorn show.  having a preachy better-than-thou person taking over a wildly popular role made famous by an established and beloved star would be like remaking the tomb raider games but replacing lara with  I dunno  wario.  everybody d hate it and no one would pay for it.  but that d be fine because it d obviously be white men s fault when it failed.  excuse me while I roll my eyes and vomit at the same time.
I ll stick with the original three movies  thank you. I still see last crusade as the ending.
I bought a ren and stimpy skateboard last night.
doomcock has been right often enough that this rumour is hard to dismiss outright. and that means this movie is very likely to be utterly dreadful. Imean the last one was horrendous enough that I no longer acknowledge its existence.
they will never let a dollar go  or a chance to virtue signal.
we saw what happened with solo. that was a decent movie despite the stupid parts but people didn t care. what makes them think people will accept anyone but harrison ford  and with deepfake tech or fountain of youth tech  you d be way better off with your investment with harrison s face than without.
disney strikes again to destroy another legacy movie character. we really do live in the age of corporate cultural vandalism.
not that Im wanting shia labeouf back but how did we get from son to granddaughter in a blink of an eye
what s sad is they used to be able to even make the female versions of characters good.  back when x-23 first came out in the comics I loved the character.  though I always wished they had brought back logan s other daughter who was a sorceress  she was a really dark character with some seriously f ed up storylines and mental issues. not just a female wolverine   not quite as messed up as evil ernie or lady death before marvel got hold of her  but dark.  but then sjws got hold of her and I wont touch the character.
she looks like she would get upset if her latte didn t have soy milk. at least try to make it believable.
but they always ignore it
and  seriously  in spite of what people say in the modern era  past decades actually had women who kicked ass and or led sci-fI fantasy entertainment.  the 70 s had lynda carter s wonder woman  lindsey wagner s bionic woman  and carrie fisher s princess leia.  the late 70s-80s had those most bad-a leading women  sigorney weaver s ellen ripley and linda hamilton s sarah connor.  and that is just the first ones that come to mind from when I was a kid and a teen.  but to watch today s youth movement talk about the various  badly done  female leads of the last half a dozen or so years as being groundbreaking makes me feel like they think that the 1910s lasted until the 2010s when  finally  someone began taking steps to give women and minorities equal rights and opportunities.  its just stupid  and it is insulting to everyone who lived before these ultra-pretentious  ultra-privileged people who talk down to us from their glittering celebrity lifestyles  reeducating the people who they consider to be dumb rubes.
it takes more time effort and creativity to create a new character based on a woman.
this is soo dissapointing to me!!! im one of the few indiana jones fans who actually loved all four movies and was super excited when I heard harrison ford was coming back for one last one. that would be totally asinine for him to not even be in the movie!
nothing surprises me anymore from lucasfilm.
on the one hand... harrison is 80. harrison is fragile as heck. so a  new  jones isn t a problem. heck the new one being a woman isn t a problem. but the new one has to stand on their own merit. also  jones doesnt need to die in order for ford to retire! always hated that hollywood habit of killing the old character in favour of the new one.thatsaid  a reboot or new tomb raider movie wouldn t be bad either  provided the writing is focused on a good story instead of world politics... actually  world politics could work. just not identity politics.
its funny how doom cock broke this story over a year ago
just make another tomb raider  folks!
I really wish they actually do it  for a simple reason   - they spend hundreds of millions making a woke movie  destroying the franchise  which is already dead - the movie bomb at thermonuclear level- the disney stock crash and burn never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake .- napoleon bonaparte
ngl  if lara croft was indiana jones  grandaughter  that would be pretty cool.
I hope indy gets a sex change and becomes a dominatrix  the whip! . after the sex change  indy ages backwards 50 years through the magic of transgenderism  and gains the ability to lift 500 pound weights and dodge bullets.female indiana is then tracked down by  her  evil brother  who attempts to give indy a sex change back to being a man  but instead indiana captures him  ties him up  gives him a sex change  and makes his brother a  woman  too  and then his brother becomes kind and compassionate  and thatsets up the sequel with both sisters working together to fight transphobic villains.
ah yes my favorite character india jones
Im already counting on not watching indy 5.its gonna be horrible.
Imean  everyone wants the hero to die in the end. thats why billy the kid  jesse james  butch cassidy  elvis  anastasia have so many theories.
lara croft  am I a joke to you  hollywood
I wish they d shoot an ending that didn t suck! wont happen  though.
this is the content of their character
indy in the disney world show is better then harrison ever was. Imean harrison is 80 so people really expect him to be indy forever  and do people really not expect disney to not keep the property alive
Im gonna write a synapses and make a movie poster of a tomb raider male character written the way they insert feminist leads into things.   going to be a fat dude in cargo shorts  hiking shoes with long socks  pistol bandolier over the chest  blue hair and square glasses. written as a high speed  super smart  and confident hero with no negative aspects. he s the cousin of laura croft... bradley.... croft...  a strong undipendant maleb. he works at a museum as a head curator that does parkour as a hobby  but is somehow still fat  but the movie will make absolutely no indication or acknowledgment of his weight or the limiting factors of that laura has been kidnapped by a super evil woman with an eyepatch  and itsomehow falls on bradley to save her. and he turns out better at it than his cousin and saves the day with his super wit and charming over the top attitude
look at what happened her with james bond. please look that up and do a video on no time to die. they ruined his character snd spit in the face of us actual bond fans. she wrote the screenplay!! please please
harrison ford is a once-in-a-lifetime guy. not easily replaced. look at that han solo movie. its okay I liked it. but he s no harrison ford
doomcock been talking about this since 2018....!!!!
they already had a progression to go with for indiana jones but I guess shia labeouf going a little mental showered them on the idea. but then again george lucas and steven spielberg the reason shia labeouf is messed up in the head because of what they did to him as a child. they owe him. indiana jones is a woman is going to fail miserably
the ending of the last crusade where indy literally rides off into the sunset is where the series ended. everything after that is non-canonical committee fiction as far as Im concerned.
this is gonna be like ghost busters women
indiana jones should sit in a toilet having the runs and the girl comes in cracking a joke about the smell and his small tiny baby pink weenie. after emasculating him to the audience  he makes a comment about living such a eventful life of adventure  completely off character cause they gotta make sure they also tell the real fans that they do not respect at all what came before or lore  then he says something like  this is my lucky hat you know. its my favorite hat. this whip too has saved my hide more times than I can remember. its the perfect combo.  then one last big ripper push. if the toilet could it d cry. the girl then makes a grossed out face covering her nose a bit and then proceeds to take indiana jones  hat off his head and his whip off the floor next to his pants around his ankles. she attaches the whip to her high tech belt  puts on the hat in slow motion then with a cocky obnoxious face that clearly expresses the exaggerated swagger of a young black teen she says  no. but they will be the perfect combo now that I ll be able to use them properly  then she just takes off. the camera then pans back to indiana jones slowly to reveal that he actually died after that last push. open eyes and open mouth dead. then the camera starts to zoom out as if to say goodbye to him for the last time. pants around his ankles  hat and whip-less  beat up  old  covered in dirt and mud  on the toilet  in an old condemned abandoned house thats falling apart and rats are all over the place doing rat things. and just before it cuts back to the new and improved strong independent woman who dont need no man and is proud to not have kids because kids add on to climate change...a random snake slithers across the doorframe.edit  also they dont play his theme for him but in the next scene itshows the girl going somewhere with the wind in her hair and a new and improved indiana jones song plays  a remixed version with  megan thee stallion. the ending credits should should also play the new song and have clips of behind the scenes of the making of the movie and megan thee stallion and the new indiana jones girl are twerking together and laughing cause thats how strong independent women on the right path do their  thang .edit 2  and in those credits the girl actor from shehulk and the black homeless girl from batwoman show up to say hI to the new indiana jones girl and megan thee stallion because even though neither are in the movie they want to show how hollywood is a small place and strong women have to stick together cause the patriarchy is always out to get them so they all twerk while a super soy beta nerd stage hand is in the background laughing with them wearing a shirt thatsays  the force is female  and dark thick rimmed glasses.
so  its another laura croft movie!
I dont think that making a laura croft movie is really an option for the producers of indiana jones since indy is owned by paramount  and laura croft is owned by warner brothers. but youre right. self-obsessed writers at the moment are incapable of creating characters with any appeal to anyone  so the best they can do is steal and or reinvent characters that better writers have created. no one wanted a female james bond  doctor who  ghostbusters  thor or iron man. but they re all gonna pretend that everyone loved those  and continue like this is a fresh new take for current year. personally  I intend to ignore indy 5. its essentially a high-budget fanfilm anyway.
by going after and replacing iconic male characters  not only do you promote women but also downgrade men. this is their goal to attract a new female audience and also hollywood as all about making sequels. so if its not woke to have men in movies with strong characters  then making sequels of iconic male chapters written out with strong and better female characters makes sense to achieve their goals.
I ll put this on my  must miss  list!  nothing to see here but the destruction of another icon!  itshould be called  girl of destiny.
why cant they just make new interesting and fun stories from scratch for new characters  did we run out of good ideas
that happened in the 90s. haven t you heard of laura croft.
when youre a part of the hollyweird cult you just do as youre told and like it. cant watch anything these people dump out on the screen at all. mel you are a trooper for watching this crap for your followers. you nerdrotic and the rest are rock stars for telling it like it is.
the best indiana jones will always be sean patrick flanery. they should have just brought him back.
crystal skulls are going to look good in comparison.
it makes sense  though. kathleen kennedy took properties made successful by men and tried to insert herself into their roles by inserting women into male characters  roles. thatseems to be the only thing she knows how to do  sadly  she cant do it well. spielberg even described her once as a glorified secretary  so there s that.
I cant wait until critical drinker reviews this one. God have mercy on their soles.
with all the bait and switches they ve done  I dont believe that director for even a second. personally  if I were to continue the series  I d go with chris pratt.
you know what  at least they re not claiming she is indie.  gotta take baby steps for these worthless woke writers.  its at least a step towards making a new character.  ford can never be replaced in the role  much like I feel jolie would be hard to replace as the big screen lara .  they re not  reimagining  him as a younger woman.  the standards are low these days for writing.
for me indiana jones was over when I watched the crystal skull movie.
ok  Im just gonna make it quick... why am I not surprised  that when disney again has their hands in it  that we see just another gender replacement  of a long established character only to further exploit a basically long finished franchise...
the rumors is that they travel back in time. young and old indI die. and now the new girl indI will have to redo all of his aventures
did you not like the young indiana jones chronicles
@five minutes of peace  never watched it.
so basically  all she knows is how to make fan fiction about herself.
if you wanna see a real female indiana jones other than lara croft  watch the series relic hunter from 1999-2002 three seasons. tia carrere does a great job playing sydney fox
mm  no.  I was a little girl that grew up watching the indiana jones flicks.  I loved my male heroes.  they were cool and amazing.  I have become steadily more and more repulsed by where my favorite movie series have gone.  stories and characters are weakly written and Im disillusioned at this point.  Im not going to spend my money on this new slop.
its not the age  its the mileage.
isn t this basically what tomb raider is  I wont be populating itsame as I never saw the new improved ghostbusters.
damn  are there any days when you dont look perfect
its wedge politics. hollywood replaces well loved male characters with gender   race   orientation swapped versions to drive wedges into society. esg is a bonus.
I blame harrison ford. he could simply say  no  to the project and they re dead in the water. but he doesnt.
bye indiana jones  it was nice knowing you.
indiana jones replaced by a woman   - the best  answer  to that is lara croft  which isn t really a  replacement  per se and doesnt even step on the toes of what it was paying homage to - which is indiana jones.   in fact  lara croft even has competition in nathan drake.   disney should stop trying to reinvent the wheel on a formula that they ll knowingly break when they put in some woke shit just to be  inclusive .
harrison ford signed off on this so thatsays something...
making indiana jones a woman is like making lara croft a man  you just dont do it. though it would be acceptable if they just make a new character and have it be a spin off called  insert name here  jones  which is what it looks like they re doing. so they re not flat out replacing harrison ford with a woman  like other movies do.
it doesnt matter what the woke mob thinks. these  woke  remakes and continuations will never be remembered the way the originals will. they ll be forgotten in a matter of months.  originals have a place in people s hearts and leave legacies no  woke  writers will ever be able to accomplish.
melonie I am loving that hoodie
Im not surprised  will probably be better than the last tomb raider movie though.
I hope it doesnt even hit half a million at the box office.
feige doesnt recast--he replaces characters with women. he has a platform to use.
so they replace one of the manliest characters in the history of cinema with a woman  its a bold strategy  cotton  let s see if it works out for them.
angelina jolie already played that part
even if the sequel wasn t woke  I wouldn t have wanted an indiana jones 5. indy s story is over.
it would be much cheaper for them to just say please dont give us your money...
@meloniemacgoboom  is this you or spam
is anyone shocked by this anymore  current disney has made it an absolute requirement take males out of hero roles and replace the beloved male icons for female ones. starwars  doctor who  I guess doctor jones now... yeesh. just reboot the damn franchise or better yet. dont make anymore. let it just be the 3 movies. they only made 3.
can you imagine if they replaced lara croft with a man  and the plot of this film is literally lara croft anyway  as you indicated...they d burn the studio down. I dont understand why they cant just make an original adventure series starring a woman  and keep indiana jones the same character...
well lets just hope that things are starting correct themselves  because Im starting see thing correct themselves. I think woke or what ever this is  dying off. mostly because everyone is getting tired of out and  throwing an outrage about it.
yeah tomb raider is the female indiana jones. now if they had it be his son and daughter working together as a new indy duo  that could have been interesting. even if they made this grandson and granddaughter would have made for a different dynamic than the original indiana jones and tomb raider but nope this is just lame.
phoebe waller-bridge who wrote all the woke parts of james bond  no time to die script. what can go wrong!
there s no reason to make indiana jones again this way. harrison is awesome  but way too old. it ll more than likely be a vfx mess along with whatever they decide to do to wreck the legacy. just do what you do with bond   replace him   give him more stories in the 1930s-1960s if they have to make more.
everybody wants to do an orgin story except when it comes to indy... go figure
are those your pjs melonie   cute shirt either way but yeah this is unfortunate news
unless this is some crossover where indy comes across croft and passes the torch because he s just too old for this shit  this sounds quite bad.
clearly for equality we should just remake the lara croft movies as larry croft
do zoomers care about indiana jones   Im 35 and Im pretty sure the audience for this has a floor around 25 the last movie came out over a decade ago.  it makes zero sense to make changes for an audience that doesnt exist.
harrison is way too old to do indiana jones  but there is no indiana without harrison  and that goes doubly for the disney 2022 gender swap all male protagonists agenda.  if they want to continue this genre  tomb raider and lara croft are the way  though I hope disney never  ever gets their hands on that ip.
this is just crazy
I d rather they just took a hint from the reverse from kindom of the crystal skull... no one wanted it at least gorge fucked up his story before disney could. indiana johns was meant to be a trilogy  not a passing-of-a-torch franchise indiana johns is in my opinion better than star wars
so indie replaced by lara croft
you did have a female archeologist but they ruined her in latest features  even in the recent games shes a simpering wee apologist lass. wokeness is the greatest ism there is.
notice how its a granddaughter replacing indy and not a grandson  a grandson that could have been straight or gay or bI or something different then  replace every popular male hero with a female . this just sounds like everything with a famous ip under disney. unless indy becomes a mentor or something that gives advice in future movies  advice that is taking seriously   I have no hope for this since Ive already lost hope in movie writing being of good quality. really  I think Im done in general with all this poor storytelling  insulting the original ips and not so hidden political agendas.
boom boom. when real laura croft walks
the original indiana jones was conceived as a remake of the old serial theater shorts from the 1930s and 40s.you cant have an indiana jones movie set with an old indy... this one will have to be at least in the 60s or 70s  hardly the same cultural atmosphere. the 1950s indy fighting the commies was already pushing it  as the sucky movie demonstrated.also  the successful ones were the judaeo-Christian themed ones  while the pagan one sucked doo-doo  hence the name   temple of doo-doo .  the space-alien one sucked doo-doo as well.
the only way they will learn is by letting them crumble and fall apart but I see people that used to love disney and all this stuff still going out of their way to make excuses why they waste money on the garbage
I hate to tell you this  sweetie... but the original tomb raider is woke.the idea of a female indiana jones  which is lara croft  after all... doin  the things indy does  dual-wielding .45s... is woke as hell. its just that the goalposts have been moved so far that itseems based  today.
a female would give up on the whole quest the first time someone shot at her.  thats it. no gd statue is worth all this.
yes I know  I heard about it you dont need to remind me
nice move disney replacing the charming ford with waller-bridge. Ive seen phoebe waller-bridge in other roles and I find her to be completely unlikeable.
boom goes the sarcasm!
I suspect the zenn diagram of indy fans and phoebe waller-bridge is two circles with no overlap.  I cant believe anyone thinks this movie is a good idea.  sad  old indy passing the torch to annoying feminist comedian   why   stop.  leave my childhood alone.  nobody wants this.and seriously  you hit the nail on the head.  you want a female indy   lara croft  right there. give us more lara movies!  I know you dont like the revised version  but I liked the alicia vikander movie and wanted a sequel  and maybe this time they could actually include some supernatural elements like the game! ! .  but I ll take a reboot.  anything.
indiana jones ended with the last crusade.
indian jones 5 should have been about his grandchildren following in his footsteps
well  more   brilliant geniuses out there!
if this comes out as physical copies they need to thrown in the trash
so they re making a tomb raider movie
is the era of entertainment over
indi-anna jones adventure to find feminity
Im a little surprised that brie larson wasn t picked. as far as Im concerned the franchise was done in with kingdom of the crystal skull.
they gonna do him just like star wars and kill him off
I dont believe this rumour. no-one would want to see her do anything apart from complain about relationships.
its not thatshe s going to replace  which at harrison s age  ok. its that they are using time travel and the male indy character will be erased completely from history then replaced bye strong wahman!
we already have female indiana jones. its called tomb raider.
doomcockwasright.
they are using time travel to erase indiana jones  like it never happened and it was her all the time
the original lara croft was absolutely  progressive  for the time  but the pendulum has swung so far that the progressives hate her now lol
current hollywood is cringe fodder for rantertainment.
there is only 3 indiana jones films.  there is no more and there will be no more.  that is reality that I choose.
we have lara croft... we also have relic hunter  why not do something with thatshow and turn it into something that doesnt feel like your watching softcore porn..
0 01 90  of the times
in few years the world will look like in the famous polish movie  sexmission
thats why its time to write and fund our own shit
this is kathleen kennedy we are talking about here  we all know she hates male role models
as far as I am concerned there are only three indiana jones movies and I should not have to say which three  itshould be obvious to most people.
disney already tried this crap by replacing johnny depp with margo robbie on pirates of the caribbean. and that completely crashed and burned. woke hollywood just never learn do they
they dont make new characters because they are changin the things mostly men like out of spite   its not a conspiracy its literally the truth  so quitsupporting these companies its one thing for them to fuck up one or two movies and still having hope and benifit of the doubt but at this point its the ppl supporting them morally and financially  if you still pay for disney plus or anything like that  you can only blame yourself    you are literally paying to kill the things you love at this point
overLord dvd was right..and for anyone who doesnt get it  he clearly indicates when he s reporting on rumors.
so lokI is going to replace indy....
should ve ended with last crusade. just putting it out there.
woke is where ip goes to die...
if they ruin this   Im hoping not   this will break something worse than star wars all I ask is bring back short round for the final run
hey melonie   cmon soon all male rol made for women james bond   indiana jones and sure many others too  so I wonder who is next
they didn t want to bring back shia labeouf who played his son in the last crusade   they could  pass the whip  to him.
she got that boys haircut when she steals indy s hat and whip
every time that cpr dummy appears on my screen I go looking for a cloth to clean my phone. is that a fly on phoebe s head
so they are replacing him I dont care how they call it   they throw everything that they remember from older movies and they want us to enjoy it... xd does anybody has a half brain in hollywood
I love your hoodie!
they are changing things because the new writers and show runners and movie developers believes that it is what sells. they dont change out of spite  because its not profitable or marketable the world runs on money and profits  once they realize that its unprofitable to make any changes  that is when they will stop  politics and your own personal beliefs will not dictate it.
I boycott disney and hollywood. really want to see avatar 2 but will probably wait for the dvd and buy itsecond hand so none of my money goes directly to hollywood. haven t paid to go to a theatre since the last avengers movie nearly 4 years ago and wont ever see another hollywood movie in theatre again.
they could ve just remade young indiana jones tv show. then years later recast ford when he dies.
like  I dont hate when they gender swap  if it happened every now and then  but every frigging studio is doing it for every movie itseems
how about this guy.though these are older videos.anthony ingruber...harrison ford and sean connery impression - indiana jones and the last crusade https   www.youtube.com watch v rg9saq2klfyblade runner harrison ford impression https   www.youtube.com watch v eequ7aqy8seanthony ingruber - harrison ford impression https   www.youtube.com watch v bba_wpdlxp4
can we be best friends cuz I agree with almost every video you posted keep up the good work
a female indiana jones is called tomb raider though...
I stopped giving a crap about indiana jones after kingdom of the crystal skull. thatsaid... love that nicktoons hoodie!
it always about  woman leads  this   woman leads  thatIm so sick   damn tired of hearing that over   over again
so it is finally in-diana jones. that p0rn flick
well  time to turn lara croft into a man.
they should have liam hemsworth play indy
haven t they learned from appointing a female dr who and how the fans were turned off for that
that is a sick hoody ren and stimpy
just dont give it any attention. let them die in abscurity
mel mac goooo
she knows...
wow  you are extra easy on the eyes today.
I rather see his son take the part
I have pretty much given up on movies.
didn t indiana jones have a son
I just wish that james mangold could just be professional bc when he freaked out over this its always a red flag. it better be worth it and we dont a replacement after this  just let it die
nah. he the witcher now! lol
@knytrydr73  he can do both  indy by day  witcher by night. both wearing tight leather and fighting sum kind of cultist.
they should just keep ford and make the new indiana jones happen in a retirement home   the quest for the lost remote control .
I look forward to not seeing this and shaming people that do
I really like youre your hoodie have on where can I get one like that I really like it
they already did indiana jones as a woman. its called tomb raider
when will they learn- probably engraved on their tombstone.
phoebe waller bridge is known for actively demanding to be inserted into famous male lead franchises to   modernize   them
she was the voice the feminist droid in solo  a star wars story.
I heard they re going to look for the chalice of woke and the pickle jar of feminism.
indiana jones will probably be run into the ground  I hope not in this case. the indy ip should be left on the shelf
they need to stop this
in before the genderswap of 007
un.................believeable! what s next  chris evans playing martin luther king
wasn t shila female enough for them when they tried this in the last train wreck
we need original properties for women to grow into the new legacy films of the future  we cant just keep recycling stuff  like if they dont attract new fans and piss off old fans who will be watching these reboots
indiana frosk jones.
its official am quitting the movie theater experience
well  there goes the neighborhood..
just make another lara croft movie. problem solved.
I cant wait for the female indiana to say that the hat will be perfect when it gits a woman
why is this even being made lol
could have at least named her virginia or carolina to be clever  but what s it matter I ain t going to see it anyways.
crystal skull killed the franchise. this coming film will be the unnecessarily disrespectful autopsy.
these lucasfilm franchises died when disney acquired them.
indiana cant die. sooooo....
waller-bridge is nothing but a third-rate sitcom writer actress from a titled family who rode longstanding family connections in showbiz to where she is now. I have no idea why hollywood keep trying to make her  a thing .
without accurately loving anyone..
so tomb raider
not only do they have to replace male role models  they have to kill off the old ones before they press on...gee... where have I heard this before
this is why I dont watch anything new really this is why I dont bother wasting my money like I said money talks stop going to watch it and eventually they will realize stop making trash let them sink let them bury themselves I dont understand why people even go out to waste money to review things when there is no point it is all youre doing is throwing money to garbage I swear people on both sides have to be stupid if they re wasting their money to see garbage
just wondering  if the angelina jolie s tomb raider films came out today  would they consider her as a mary sue and the movies woke
I ll just stick with the original three
sighs
we have a female  indy   her name is lara croft and alicia vikander was brilliant!leave indy alone for f  k sake...
why are they so incapable of creating original content now days  what happned to the imagination  creativity  its all gone. everything is just remakes. remasters. or adopted stories from older books

they just have to lern when to stop series
this is more sinister - not film - films!they have money to burn I supose...
well I bet it will be a lesbian cause indiana jones dont like snakes Im a snake
need that bp2 video movie was so dogshht
you needed to not eff up the last movie so bad so shia labouf could take over  if he was sane.what they need to do is stop making these movies and if they just have to focus on the young indiana jones and cast someone that was younger than harrison ford in raiders
so glad I dont watch modern tv movies anymore.
hes not replaceable
dont get why so many fans hate the crystal skull...im not a hardcore fan but I though it was 1 of the better movies out there  iv seen the other 3 as well...last crusade is 1 of the best movies ever..but you cant except hollywood to make movies that way anymore...that was over 30yrs ago....
diana jones and the temple of woke! give them an oscar now for most diverse cast and worst script and save us all the pain of hoping for better.
wait  what
phoebe waller- bridge...clinteastwoodgrimace.gif
great... now its more like illinois jones. -sincerly  a hoosier.
doomcock was right !
they are always there to make a plastic copy of iconic men but where were they when the hordes decided to turn joan of arc bi
best not be  or they re going to lose more money and fans. wonder when they re going to figure it out   people aren t happy as it is
I wish there was a movie version of indiana jones and the fate of atlantis but too much time has past now and harrison ford is old and looks chronically depressed.
relic hunter tv.
ren and stimpy!!!!!!! yyyyyyyeeeessssss!!!!!!
no.  indiana jones movies are cinematic roller coaster action rides.  that is why people watch them.
I think the reason why so many dont consider the lara croft reboot  re 7 remake  gow  2018 etc not as woke because many modern gamers  came into gaming during the 2nd half of previous gen  2016 2018 . the term  woke  also wasnt used prior to 2016  it was just  third wave feminists   sjw s . before 2016 it were mainly us traditonal comic   game lovers being attacked  and often with the blessing of the general public. and even other fandoms not speaking out in the hopes their beloved franchises wouldnt be targetted. and of course there was the group who constantly fell for lines like  its just a one time little change  and the typical  perv shamming . and many also didnt witnessed  gamer gate  and the battle between 2010   2016 that took place inside the various game studios  who invited the likes of sarkeesian  simone  wu etc in  and took their council to heart.which to my experience all changed in 2016  which was a bizzar moment various things came together. by that time they fully controled gaming media and fan platforms  either through buy outs or infiltration   hijacking  but they had the infrastructure in place to go attack mainstream casual audiences and their franchises. and with trump winning the elections this whole new can of gasoline was thrown over the whole thing. it was crazy.
she was great I  fleabag
bindy_anna  a wisecracking transgender australian orphan
if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it does it make a sound did she really replace harrison ford when no one watches it
lol writers in hollywood
yep same here
cgIversion. like harlock or final fantasy the spirits within.
oh God no please no reboot if you want to reboot all youre going to get is the typical  updated for a modern audience  and that would be scary
I dont like the idea of letting the character die just because ford is indiana jones. just manage the character same as james bond. it isn t a crazy idea. get another actor for new trilogy. not a continuation  not a reboot  not a reimagining  just new adventures. like temple of doom.
when indie  dr jones sr  and their friends road off into the sunset at the end of the last crusade  itshould have ended there. anything that comes after is not indiana jones.
mindy-anna jane gonna whip it gud!!!  another one bites the dust.
I dont even know who this broad is and she s almost 40 . there is no going forward
its not that wouldn t be down to watch a movie about a female adventurer. its that I dont watch indiana jones to see people that aren t. well.. indiana jones.
we ll  its not aliens
and guess what  no one liked any of the endings
they could make their own female led franchise and have indianna jones do a cameo.  thatseems more appropriate to me.  it could be like the librarian  or the relic hunter and they happen to know each other.  stop trying to kill harrison ford.  he really is too old for this shit.
why cant they just let these franchises retire in peace. make some new shit that could be inspired by them  but dont do it like this. then again that requires the tiny bit of creativity that they dont have  I guess
lmao they just hired a female british brunette  phoebe waller bridge  to be indiana s prot g   ugh sorry to be a downer but being a classic lara croft fan is really depressing right now. I wish an indiana and lara collab would be embraced but when that idea was brought up to george lucas s company for a lego game starring them both  it came to light they weren t happy about lara being based off of indiana basically.. so a collab likely will never happen sadly
they will do the same thing like in the new  star wars . but this time Im not gonna watch it.
lawd hahhh meerrrthyyy melonie I like when u throw dat hair up
wow  I wonder if it will bomb like everything else
I didn t watch matrix 4 and I wont watch this is they try and pull some shit. I also didn t watch the last james bond movie because I know where their agenda is going. recast indy as chris pratt  thats the only option I ll accept. he looks just like him.
they should just come up with new ideas instead of remaking the same thing over and over . maybe its time to just move on and let them do their thing .
my opinion of the movies.. 1. wow  great movie 2. weird but ok 3. entertaining but meh 4. really  5 omg let it die!
doomcock was right...
does that mean we can recast lara croft a a man  leroy croft .................leonard croft ...........................................leonardo croft............................................loft croft  I dont know  Im just spit balling...................call me disney...
so indys gonna time travel me tooim gonna go back in time and stop kathleen kennedy from being bornand save lucasfilm from her bullshit
this sucks. I thought this whole movie was a rumor until this . so this is for sure happening
not even women want this....
Im a somewhat different mentality. if youre gonna gender swap going forward no matter how clich  and cringe this trend may be  fine  Im all for it  but  get the right woman. phoebe waller is absolutely not the right woman.
eeeeek!  a 3-name person!
too be honest its not really a big deal harrison ford getting way too old hope they make it good
if they re gonna destroy the franchise and replace him with a woman  at least use one thats nice on the eyes.
well disney lucasfilm doesnt have the rights to tomb raider and lacks the creative ability to produce anything new. that leaves them with one choice other than scrap the franchise and that is recast. now current disney find the idea of recasting the central character as a male a perversion so... woman.
first it was  ghost busters then he-mann they got scooby-doo now indian jones what s next friday the 13th when we find out jason is non binary
this is a character   series thatshould end.  it isn t setup to replace the actor like doctor who or bond. they honestly think that audiences will accept a hand me down.  for the love of God.  create a new ip.  history has shown we can accept good female leads   characters.   plus get a better actress.  as others have said  there are only 3 movies in this franchise
sadly the only good thing about the new lara is the rule34 lol
destroying beloved character s legacies and stories to simply fit a woke agenda is just proving the complete opposite of what that movement is trying to achieve.   write new stories and create new legacies and leave the classics alone.  we cant rewrite the past  those films had a place in time and they were great because of the fact that the sole purpose behind each film was to entertain... those films didn t have an agenda being shoved to their audience.  the purpose for many of those blockbuster films like indiana jones was to fill the theaters with ticket sales.  go woke  go broke!!!
all the people going how great it is that woman is replacing indy with a woman would go nuts if lara was replaced by a man
all harrison ford need do is just identified as a woman because
we literally have tomb raider... wth is wrong with people
a really good well written lara croft movie would be awesome. the creators of the original tomb raider game franchise admitted thatshe was partly inspired by indy  so why not do that well the why is that the current crop of hollywood writers are totally and utterly incompetent. they cant write good anything. they re shit.they do the exact same stupid shit in everything they write because they aren t writers. seriously  they aren t writers  they are political activists.they dont know how to write anything.this problem ain t going away any time soon  much as we might hope.
well she will still be better than shaI labeouf.
waller-bridge  you say  probably give this one a pass. the 4th one was bad enough.
or bring back shia la beouf
so tomb raider becomes a man  when
crystal skull was bad enough  I dont need to see another.
miss the Bible verses
nothing about phoebe waller-bridge speaks action hero.  not to mention that every property she s touched has turned to crap.
atleast an action archaeologist woman is beleivable. its when you do it to action heroes and superheroes it becomes stupid.
why do they need this when lara croft exists   I ll tell you exactly why.  because disney doesnt own lara croft.
good luck making money mwahahahahaja
its a male centered audience and they replace indy with a lady yeah that will work
nah  I liked the new game lara croft. she is not the same because is tomb raider begins. she has to become the lara we all know. the new movie though  was trash.
Imean  I think some people asked for this....but it was a stupid ask.
this next indiana jones doesnt have everything people want. I haven t heard shia getting brought up... huh  huh everyone seeing this comment   I hate you.
and like all other attempts this movie will flop also. apparently they re not out to make money any more.
just make a good tomb raider movie
there are only three indiana jones movies.
you canthank shia labeouf for why they went with a female.
at least its not shia...
logically its like boys grew up in these stories obviously  its for young boys growing up n us who grew up are men  putting these chicks in the for front is just weird  I dont wanna see it  just see indys death on a youtube clip.
they really really really!!! dont want money do they  p thats fine im more then happy to spend my money els where    because why would I waste it on woke agenda... get lost disney!
ok  fair  harrison ford is too old for this sht  but he can be replaced...just leave the franchise alone...
any indiana jones movie without harrison ford is gonna flop.
cant wait to not watch cindy lana jones.
the movie rights are up for sale  probably pretty cheap considering how cheap the game series even sold for. the tomb raider name has been desecrated
@melonie mac go boom  I wish I could buy it for you melonie.
george lucas and steven speilberg have done the outrighr impossible  they created a fictional character even more annoying than willie scott in the form of shia lebouf. they deserve a razzie for that.
seems so odd to target a demographic that has 30  less disposable income.
Im not going to watch it. I am happy with rotla   tod   and tlc.
the story is that they f-ed up! yet another  change that character into a female  by lazy writers. oh well  we had three  I say it again three  good indiana jones movies!
I would rather watch paint dry then the this indy film.  how to make a new indy film recast with a younger male actor!!
objection  hearsay.
love you
and no doubt she ll be a mary sue  perfect at everything she does  and every man in the movie will be stupid and incompetent. cant wait for this movie!
if they wanted a female indiana jones they could have just made a new tomb raider movie instead...
I cant wait for a female witcher   why casting liam hemsworth
I agree.. so tomb raider doesnt exist
not watching that  next!
a side from the fact that this pisses me off beyond belief  I have absolutely no idea who this chick is. I wont be watching chickiana jones
so they have chosen not to just end franchise  they decided to outright burn and bury it.they replace very charismatic iconic actor with...this. she is feminist levels of funny  has acting skills of a wooden stump and dont even get me started on her appearances. its trash. nothing she was involved with patriotically benefitted from her being there.
omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Imean  he needs to pass the torch. dude s a fucking hundred and he hasn t been the same since he fucked his back up like thirty years ago. in theory I would even be okay with it being a woman. but I have absolutely no faith they will do a good job.
fuggin ay
it will be a massive flop  when will these tools learn
yeah  Im kinda over indie fighting nazis since the left start calling us all nazis...
of course they d kill him off    I knew they d wanna kill another straight white male character   Imean I know the actor is old but blummin heck do they have to kill off all our heroes  now ford will have potentially died in both star wars and indians jones
will not see if they re taking it that route. seriously  lara croft is the female equivalent of indiana jones. let indiana jones be indiana jones  a male lead. just stop. its so stupid. thats like trying to make james bond a woman. -_- but this is why Ive made it my own personal vow to never watch anything disney has control over. the less money they get for their poor decisions that they keep making with huge franchises the more they will hopefully learn since it will be nailing them in their pockets.
men liked it  so that made it bad.
I hope they at least bring back the nazI face melting
harrison ford was hot  this woman isn t. and Im straight.and yes... it is important  being hot is part of the character s charm.
well  its alright. this will will. no one except the losers will see it. disney is failing hard  and basically have destroyed their brand  which is very amusing.. what is even more amusing  is the reaction is coming.. like a freight train.
why would movie makers take one of the best movie franchises ever and change the main character into a woman. I am so tired of movie makers being lazy and instead of coming up with new stories taking old ones and either race swapping from white to black or gender swapping from male to female.  no one is going to want to see this movie if they are true indiana jones fans.
cool  I wont watch it.
indy a woman       this is sick!!!!!!
and another franchise dies like black panther  because disney is obcessed with woke bs.
4th movie set up shia leboef as his successor   and then shia went off the rails.  but this is modern feminism.  it isn t about equality  its about replacement of men  with women  bring down men  so that women can replace them.
nah  I support it. do it  and more - make 100  of movie characters black women. do it.
these reports aren t true  the director said there hasn t been any screenings yet  and indy doesnt get replaced in any cut  it was never discussed
what s the point of replacing indiana jones  are they building the  indyverse   seems kind of pointless  just another bit of real estate claimed in the culture war.
of course they are going back to the  yatzees  as the enemy. so many of the che guevara fanbois in and out of hollywood panned the last indy film for having a ussr communist as the villain.
wokeness is the end of creativity... what a joke
its funny how they think that women can only be successful when standing on the shoulders of a man. always this change of an original male character in a known franchise instead of making a new character in a new franchise. guess they think women cant succeed by themselves although history shows that they can  aliens  resident evil  tomb raider  xena  underworld and so many more . anyway indy franchise died in the 4th movie  so waste of time.
this was figured out years ago. more woke garbage to ruin another great franchise. you are correct though  just make a lara croft film instead. also  the last film shia lebeouf was supposed to take over the roll after that film. if anything give it to tom hardy or statham since they can do their own stunts. I hope this film bombs just like the rest of the films as of late.
just let it die already. the last one was already terrible.
Christ. its okay to end things. in fact  they should end every franchise from the eighties. they had a great hay day  and today s social climate would just mess it up anyway.
awesome I cant wait to be called a sexist again for not going to see this one.
I just noticed now we have a black sherlock holmes. wtf! sherlock is meant to be white!! that is not racist to say that. there is a black detective in fiction. didn t morgan freeman play a detective in couple movies
I am not watching this movie!
spoiler alert  its gonna suck
the franchise is dead to me.  whatever company supports this is dead to me.
this will suck right out loud so nobody is going to watch it anyway
this will fail.
indiana jones will be great     when he is replaced with a woman.....  batwoman series again
here we go again  another flop inbound.
why wouldn t youreplace indy with his son  a character who already exists ridiculous
overLord dvd covers this bullshit.  disney has  scrapbooked  their movies and thats why they seem all jacked up.  I d like to see a collaboration with you two because lara croft is the female indiana jones.  I hate this  replace male lead with female lead  horseshit that hollyweird is pumping out.  go boom!
dont waste your money just get a bootleg what s the point of supporting trash the hell with them
waiting for the male tomb raider. better still the transgender one.
omg who do people still believe doomcock  he is wrong 100  yet people love to be lied to. I thought better of melonie
why are there nazis around when indy is this old   this movie should be taking place in the 60s for Christ sake. at least. the last movie was too bad for me to bother with the plot or watch it ever again in the 15 years its been  that movie took place in the 50s didn t it.  was cate blanchett some nazI holdover   I dont remember.  either way. its gonna be another 10 to 15 years later at least and he s still fighting some nazis
ur very cute by the way. my messages were not towards you.
another flop !
because it takes a woman...  sherlock holmes wasnt good enough and now neither is indiana jones.
she s a terrible actress.
because feminists fucking star wars up wasn t enough.
Im just tired of every male hero being replaced by a woman and a complete inability to create their own female characters. be original and make something new. I will save my money for something better.
can we please stop gender swapping established characters  how about we just go for an obese  black  lesbian  trans-woman indiana jones in a mobility scooter
gez  hollyweird! come up with something original! this will be another money pit!
lmao  another flop
this would be garbage
none of this nonsense is the main reason Im not going to watch this junk  the main reason is kingdom of the crystal skull. thatsaid  who wants this
another one  . .. I wonder if there are any movies nowadays where well established characters are replaced by a white male
who cares
oh look.. another crap movie I wont see.
replace ford with that guy who played a young han solo.  alden anglerfish or whatever.  why not
