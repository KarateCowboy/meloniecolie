if amazon cant handle a property like Lord of the rings then we shouldn t have faith in them when it comes to lara croft.
if its like amazon s other treatment of established properties there s no way this can go wrong!
thats a huge huge mistake for crystal to do this. there is better devs in embracer that could take the franchise to a new height. I dont trust amazon  they will make the game more woke and it will be a death knell for the franchise. keep up the good work melonie! loving your content as always!
let s come together and make our own. there s enough people and a fan base to pull of an incredible game. call it our raider and call her laura croft so there s no lawsuit. after all no one can say laura in america  even though everyone calls her that even though its lara haha
amazon is where fandoms go to die. Im sorry melonie
well shit  rest in peace lara... I had hoped she would finally find redemption after all these years of mismanagement.
concerning lara s love interests  I always loved it when lara had some flirty tension towards male or female characters  but it never developed into more  like alicia vikander and daniel wu  because her next adventure was calling  and this was more important to her...
I have zero hopes for tr as long as crystal dynamics are the developers  and teaming up with amazon is just a huge redflag
Imourned lara when she died in revelation. she was never the same since  and Im sad I haven t seen that character that influenced my own creativity and story telling. I love the adventure and the strong character she was  but I definitely would rather the character never to come back then to have woke lara. make it a different game with a different name then!
I just wanted to pop in and say in regards to tuesday s video  just how proud I am of you for that video. I would argue that was one of the most necessary things you ve ever produced. it has such an important message given the times we re living in. it may make some people mad  but on the flip side Im sure its planting more seeds than you may realize. and I would bet that you have some crowns awaiting you to cast at Jesus  feet for all that youre doing    way to go  melonie. that video was fantastic
every time I hear about amazon games  Im like   thats still a thing
just found u last week. and been enjoying every bit of content. especially when u cover tomb raider. u echo so much of my thoughts and I swear this channel is soo relatable. I love how u express your views and are very entertaining to watch. love your videos!
laura cruz should make a comeback. lara croft is done for.
amazon making a tomb raider game will be like watching a meteor shower  its fun to watch something crash and burn  and you can predict it beforehand.
just found you today from someone else who has regrets about where their favorite things have been unnecessarily taken. to put it lightly our synchronization of values is greatly refreshing! lara s been a beloved character of mine for some years but Im not well-versed in all her incarnations. its lovely to see such a true fan with firm opinions and dedicated  practically objective-feeling analysis! thank you for it all. great taste!
she s gonna be delivering amazon packages for sure in the game
I played all tr games  love franchise  love classic a lot  but I also likes last 3 games  was fun to see lara grow.
I feel like if this fails due to embracer not funding this but instead having amazon do itshows that if this fails then embracer might just take the tomb raider ip from cd and give it to another one of their studios. personally if this does happen then I would want tomb raider to go to thq nordic cuz they seem to have an appreciation for classic games as itshows in the remakes that they ve made such as destroy all humans and spongebob battle for bikinI bottom rehydrated.
Im with you all the way. not a huge tr fan but was as a kid and if they make a good classic tr again that mainly focuses on adventure  puzzles and mostly has a story to keep you going from one place to the next. I ll pay top dollar for that. but not this...
I remember watching my buddies in college play the classic lara croft tomb raider games. I never played but they looked like a lot of fun.
yeah it looks like we just need to stop putting faith in  money  doll-hairs and choose to live to create good art
or anything
I actually sometimes would do this but amazon doesnt have a huge catalog of failures most of the stuff they make are pretty decent
amazon did give us terminal list. however  this is actually crystal dynamics. which did shirt job in an avengers game. which prompted square enix to sell the studio
@animezilla 44  lol  I actually sometimes would do this but amazon astroturfs online media discussion using paid liars they couldn t pay enough to ever play their shit ass videogames or actually watch their woke trash movies.
I d say give the publisher a chance. its the writers
yeah  henry gets to hire his choice of people.
they re supposed to do warhammer 40k too. not sure how a woke company can make a tv show about the most intolerant and offensive fictional universe.
@josef smonkin  watch terminal list. that is from amazon too. the studios making the projects are why it goes woke.
@animezilla4486  yeah like that mmo of theirs  lmao
tomb raider director reveals every gun in the game is white
its fine... they ll give her the rings of power and she will ascend to mr t. status.
hey... thats the opposite of reality!
I heard jack ryan was good.
@douglas briel    you must have heard that from someone who s never read the books or seen the old movies.
@jay sullivan  100  possible. but Im trying to be optimistic. hahaha!
guyladriel croft incoming!
crystal dynamics is the studio. not amazon. which is even worse
true. but I dont think amazon has that big of a spoon in this soup. publishers mostly means better advertising. they dont involve themselves  usually  in development.
and why is that what has Lord of the rings got to go with lara croft totally different genre of story
amazons new lara croft 6 10  tall  built like a football linebacker  extra large blue mohawk  fully tattooed like a yakuza and 5 o clock shadow.
like the boys  for example thats an amazon show  adaption from the comics was done very well. its widly acclaimed  just saying its an amazon show.
@amoneywilson  better than square enix tbh. sure  the tomb raider we all have in our hearts is the core design era  but crystal dynamics at least didn t write a story that interfered with the classic games story so much like square enix s did. and  important to notice  they gave us video game milestones like the legacy of kain saga or gex. so it could definitely be worse after all.
@douglas briel  it is good  just shouldn t be called jack ryan. amazon just takes big names then writes their own stories  backgrounds  everything.. still  great series.. it just has nothing to do with jack ryan minus using names  basic concepts and the cia.
@iphetus  thanks. there are so many series these days  I cant keep up.
I trust even more the modders.
embracer made that newest saints row game that was so woke and so bad it completely destroyed the group that made it. sooo.... yeah
its gotta fail before it can become good again.
@k1n63d  that was deep silver.
even though  amazon pushed the so-called big mmorpg game  new world  order      yes  its real thing after nvidia put out 30 series cards. this game crashed lots of 3080 90s gpus what made gamers angry at amazon. they have made a stupid move again with crystal dynamics. what could possibly go wrong  this is why amazon should not be a game publisher.
@vigol  the new world problem was nvidia not amazon  buildzoid did videos on it. the rtx 3090 tI was made with a stronger vrm so it wont self-destruct in games.
@w1llki11edsnake07  irrelevant as embracer owned deep silver. embracer was involved in every aspect of that game and even issued an apology for it. this game killed deep silver and everyone was liquidated and relocated. dont bring any semantics bs here.
@k1n63d  and yet deep silver are the ones publishing dead island 2. so how are the dead  no bs here. embracer is the one providing the money for these things. deep silver was the publisher. accurate information is important.
@k1n63d  ahahaahahhaha!
we could call it  boom raider   starring melonie macroft.
raider of tombs  starring lisa crow.
why are those names so funny itsounds like the wish version lmaooo
not  laura kraft  the cheesyless
how about clara loft  tomb explorer
its a great idea  Ive actually thought about it too.
I hope you know they would definitely sue. they would probably even sue if you called her  jen wilkens  or whatever. also  the name wouldn t matter  as its basically never said in the good games.
what if we used lara s original name  laura cruz  she was supposed to be a south american woman too before eidos changed her to be more market friendly  gross oversimplification  but I shit you not  that was the reason more or less
@michael lane  we could get a kraft cheese sponsorship! the game would pay for itself lol
@rambleon07  ikr  they even have the dino shapes already so you just need a few more things for that to work....
@w1llki11edsnake07  yes keep laughing in your confusion.
I trust crystal dynamic more than any other game developer
u seem to forget that crystal is still developing the game
@k1n63d   deep silver made it embracer group funded it and im glad embracer group dropped volition after the games poor reception even though itsold well no one liked it
ikr and what happened to eidos    they was with tomb raider since the begining what is going on
@k1n63d  how is it irrelevant deep silver volition already proved themselves incompetent with saints row 4  saints row gat out of hell  and agents of mayhem what in the absolute fuck makes deep silvers involvement irrelevant ! they were making shit games before they were even bought!
laura croft would still get you dragged through the court and you d lose its way too close.
I agree the character cannot be purchased by amazon to ruin. they picked the wrong community to try shepherding with  s
does not even have to have a name similar. make a character that is pleasing to look at  and have her do the same things as tomb raider  if its good  it will succeed and fans will come
my sister s name is lara. sound it out  la   ra. exact spelling too. I always hated when anyone called her laura. lara is a russian origin name  but croft and my little sister are of utmost tough origin. go go gadget raider!
lotr is dead because rings of power lmfao
@dennisthemenace  they are working on it.  season 2 coming to amazon prime soon.  yay.
@dennisthemenace  rings of power is produced by amazon. that means it comes directly from amazon.however  amazon being a publisher  in the case of tr  it means just that. published by amazon. not developed.publishing mostly means advertisement. I also work for a company that publishes games. and I know for a fact  we dont interfere with development. its just marketing.
@radioactivegoose  you own what you buy
I can understand the first reboot game okay and then the second one with trinity and shadow of tomb raider is still with trinity now they re trying to turn into a lesbian which was not done even an underworld I have itshe trying to stop a guy from destroying the world which she did thats called redemption but this is a serious problem more mismanagement
hard agree. I just finished playing the latest trilogy and I dreaded the fact thatshe might end up with jonah. thank God it didn t happen.
I always saw that as her manipulating them. she knew most men would want her.
duke nukem wooed lara croft.
I always viewed lara croft as a femme fatale. in that  Imean  she used sexuality as a tool in her arsenal and thatshe wasn t in any way controlled by such urges.
I disagree crystal dynamic did good job with the previous tomb raider games
@animezilla 44  the first 2  yes. the last one was  well  kind of good.
@welearntogheter  3rd was not developed by crystal dynamics....they did the first 2 and square enix forced them to move to avengers game and many left... shadow of tomb raider developed by edios montreal and nixxes software....reddit ex dev says thatshadow of tomb raider even though had the same story as released  it did not have same approach to gameplay.. it would be very similar to first 2 games... edios wanted it to be exploration based saying first 2 didn t meet sales expectations..
@asheeth kumar  now it makes sense why the story was quite off. I played it until I got to that cave where you find a few monsters  but I got bored pretty quick after that.
@welearntogheter  yea  edios wanted it to be exploration based with more open areas to explore  trying to advantage of open world hypes these days...good news is  crystal dynamics is joining hands with amazon for new tomb raider...
however on that note I did enjoy some of aod and legend era but still itstarted to dive bomb.
@tasia elise  legend era was great imo.
ah remember chronicles  that was the best requiem for a character like lara croft.
aw thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom
cant we start a petition to make melonie lead game designer at crystal dynamix....then there d be hope!
thank you so much  bless you!
@melonie mac go boom  bless you too melonie. youre a needed voice of reason and deeply respect how u hold on to your values. you got a new fan here.
@nova  well tomb rider is kinda her thing but I agree with everything
@itachI uchiha  I see. ty for telling me really. now thats even better news for me.if Imay ask  what s ur fav tr game
welcome to yt...thats youtube.. geekfandom  try not to be too jealous of her having a real life sized lara croft....if you managed it  tell me how.    I cant even seem to find a good looking figurine these days.  _
they might actually treat the character with respect if this happens
they arnt making the game crystal dynamics is
they re not making it! they re helping out with the publishing. calm down  people.embracer own tr. and cd are developing. with amazon on board  we should be able to get tr to an even bigger audience.the rebirth trilogy has sold over 40 million! stop denying success.
in the end the one with the money has the final say. or else they pull their funding
a good developer could make a fun mobile game with that premise  I bet. just not with lara lol
when it comes to lara s love interest I would prefer it better if it were more ambiguous than truly impactful to the story. melina juergens  senua a sacrifice  would have the range to really captivate an audience as lara. from sophisticated to ferocious moments she can get the job done. I see the possibilities of fleshing certain aspects of her character without making it totally ridiculous. I never could see lara putting herself in a werner von croy position but collaborations with jonah or the like became something I was getting used to seeing. if crystal wants to catch my eye lara needs a better look and cutting edge gameplay mechanics. Im tired of playing games with that walking between walls animation lol
it is so amazing how companies never learn
its amazing how the game designers are going out of their way to not make lara croft a sexy girlboss despite the fact that we live in an age that encourages sexy girlbosses. as far as Im concerned  she d fit right in lmao
just please no more or at least not as much human enemies. core did such interesting enemies to fight like centaurs and beast with crazy bosses like a weird torso thing and giant sheeva statue. I want to go back to that.
Im sure they ll put in just as much passion and effort as they did with rings of power.
I bought a playstation 1 in 1996 and had the option of buying the console with either f1 or tomb raider. I bought the one that came with tomb raider and I couldn t stop playing the game as it was a fantastic game. I then played many of the subsequent sequels  but when I played tomb raider 2013 version I found that around halfway through the game lara had turned from a tomb raider into a mass killer. I think I had killed around 100 men by the time I quit the game. I just want to explore temples and work out puzzles like in the original games.
I honestly think if they really wanted to unify the timelines they could do it in a great way  I am a writer so I could personally find ways to connect all three  but after hearing the leaks and the info we already have  you cantell they still have no desire to unify them in a satisfying way and instead keep it  like you put it... reboot lara wearing cosplay.
I like you. you get the classic games. its all about the puzzles. and those were gloriously epic. thank you.
stop ruining our games people. oh hImelonie you look great. back to the show.  biggest and best tr yet  blahaha right. youre not just giant talking head. we dont want family drama. we want the action adventure tomb raiding lara croft. Imiss the fantasy bombshell lara. great video. love ya mel. take care
hoping for the best outcome for this. if the gameplay ends up being good and focuses less on being a 3rd person action game and more of a platformer I can see myself getting some enjoyment out of it. if the story ends up being disappointing I ll probably just block it out and play it for the gameplay.
crystal dynamics   we have a strong  complex  and realistic lara croft! amazon   hold my pick-axe!
you put my thoughts into words perfectly. crystal ruined lara s legacy and its getting worse with each release and publisher.
Im looking forward to seeing what tomb raider looks like in unreal engine. hoping for some nanite and lumen support. I dont remember what they all talked about in the ue5 launch day video
looking forward to new world! but also  hoping lara croft games bring back the old charm
given how this game is most likely going to get treated  you d think lara croft raided the vault of a couple of amazon higher ups
all I want from tomb raider is a good story and for lara to look like she did in the first 3 games.  but since amazon is involved I have no hope that either of those will happen.
have you ever heard of the definition of insanity    its trying the same thing and expecting a different result.
I liked the modern trilogy. I hope they do something like they said to combine the old lara with the modern one  I hope thats the case. greeting. melonie
I played the classics  I liked it  but I became a fan after the reboot. there s an audience for every version of lara croft.
I always saw lara croft  as the cocky british noble antI hero  who travels the world exploring dangerous and lost places for her amusement. her collection of artifacts are simply testaments to adventures. she is not a hero  she does what it takes to get her prize  but she doesnt go out her way to hurt and she is definitely not a victim.
its impossible to unify tbh there s no possible way it could make sense
they could do a multiverse story. classic  legend  and reboot are just different versions of lara. this way they dont have to shoehorn every aspect of there stories together.
all I ask in a tomb raider game is for lara croft not to cry she never did that in the classics. also Ive really enjoyed your content this year so I like to wish you and your family a very merry Christmas and a prosperous new year     and stay safe these holidays.
love when you do tomb raider videos
my poor childhood. Imiss the true lara croft.
new to your channel  like the content I definitl relate to keeping true to our fav games source material  its seems like a home run but these studios wont give us what we want.love the lara croft games been played all of them since the og playstation debut. hated that they changed her back story and personality.thinking optimistically  if the deal is just amazon providing a bigger budget  it could be great  hope its not some scheme from amazon to acquire a gaming company and create a bigger monopoly.... microsoft is being blocked from acquiring activision by ftc for suspicion of that very thing!
wish I could be excited by this.
core design s original lara was perfection  and crystal dynamics first incarnation between legend and underworld was a brilliant version in her own right but after seeing what became of Lord of the rings  Ive lost all hope now. lara to me is intelligent  badass  sarcastic  witty and determined. the recent lara was determined alright  and had her badass moments as well as intelligent  but what made her iconic was just not there.edit  I liked the point about the heroism. at her core  lara was a grave robber. her saving the world just became a necessity when she saw what her adversaries wanted with the artefacts. it didn t change the fact thatshe was in her profession for thrills  just thatshe could see the bigger picture. ironically  I think one of the characters in chronicles made the same point when reminiscing on some of her other adventures.
I just realize they have to put a love interest in all the games cause they dont have it anymore in real life.
you just know they re never going cast an actress or do a writing that truly represents lara croft..
would be cool if they made a follow up to the last revelation  which is my favorite  like any of the games since aod had never happened.
oh my. I agree  I really am against giving lara some sort of a  love interest   whether its male  female or whatever in between... I have always  since I was a kid  been against it. not because Im a homophobe  not because I despise love or relationships  no  simply because its  like you said  out of character! my lara  the classic lara  was always the lone wolf who simply had no time nor interest in dating. its just how she s  built  in my opinion  what she s used to  how she grew to be.and Ive always had issues with all of these changes in her character  in her entire Goddamn past  all of this  we must make it more realistic and relatable ... eh. I dont think I would ve gotten that obsessed with this franchise and the character herself if she had been some sort of an average gal with average skills and a ton of emotions... Imean  I was that emotional  average teen who found these games and absolutely fell in love with the character. and there are many others like me. if someone doesnt like it  why change it  surely there are plenty of other franchise and characters for those who wish for something more  relatable  and  realistic . let us have our thing for Christ s sake... but no.ah well  rambling now. at least I ll always have the classic games
I just want the larger than life lara croft whose sole love is adventure as she blasts into an ancient ruin  slaughters ancient creatures and threatens weaklings with death if they dont do as she demands.
Im 37 years old and I never liked the old tomb raiders because the controls were so aggravating-I thought the new tomb raiders were fun the entire way through and I never played enough of the old ones to know I was missing out on anything but I appreciate your obvious nostalgia where the originals are concerned!!I just feel like the new ones were so much better that it didn t even compete and I feel like it will be a cold day in hell before we ll ever get another tomb raider as good as the last three
amazon seem determined to destroy ips. are they in a competition with disney
over-under on the number of times they say   synergy  in the press release Im going with seven.Im so tired of giant companies thinking they can just acquire their way into fanbases.  Im struggling to think of a situation where a megacorp acquired an existing  popular ip and turned out a well regarded product.  Im sure its probably happened  Im just drawing a blank.
melonie  I also heard amazon was rebooting stargate. I dont want to think about how bad and woke that will be.
I literally tried to play the reboot era again  and its so dumbed down at this point. so much family trauma it feels like Im her therapist. like I just wanna be a badass powerhouse and go on an adventure. not be coddled by the game in everything I explore and listen to her daddy issues.
melonie mac  you are entirely correct the classics were the best of lara croft. thanks for sharing.
when I heard about this news I was like ergh...I dont have much hope for crystal anymore in the slightest.
I had a feeling you would make a video on this love the hoodie. you look great melonie
as someone who s never played a tomb raider game I love your videos on tomb raider and how passionate you are about it
big agree! and thank you so much  merry Christmas!
why do they call you  kiwis   and do kiwis even grow in nz
@johnny kush  kiwis around national bird they are flightless they re actually related to the emu and ostrich but much much smaller about 45 cm tall for our biggest kiwi. and they are nocturnal.
she shed a tear in   the last revelation   when the sergent kills himself in order to slay the giant monster. original lara had principes while being strong.
yeah  Imiss the times when I could get excited for a new game or movie...
you used to be able to play the whole first game in your browser. I dont remember the site  though.
@jay sullivan   open lara   still works really well  thats where im playing it currently
developer studio and publisher are different things.  as long as the publisher  who may have nothing to do with development  doesnt force or reject certain things.  Im not sure how amazon screens their games but yeah.
Ive been a tomb raider fan since 1997 and Ive played every single game in the franchise apart from one of the game boy games I believe. please crystal we just want classic lara back. yes make gameplay innovations  spin us a great story  make it pretty and immersive but dont forget what the tomb raider name means to the fans. lara isn t broken. she doesnt need to be fixed. just give her dual pistols back and an new tomb to raid and she ll be just fine.
and I bet lara s main mission will be  take down the patriarchy
rip tomb raider  thx for the memories
totally agree! I dont care about lara s love life  it was never important and I dont think it adds anything to the character or the story.
amazon getting involved with anything besides selling products worries me.
unify the timelines  and  protector of artifacts  just makes me think we re going to get something similar to croft manor in anniversary where we can assume that lara got all of the old artifacts without us actually seeing them. kind of a bait and switch.
there just better be a physical version.
melonie  I feel like this is your worst nightmare come true. Im so sorry.
good news  I hope it will be an open world
Im not a gamer but I loved angelina as laura croft tomb raider. also I do respect the passion that true fans have for the history of the story.. plus some weak arse twxt messing with my joy! my money stays in my pocket. great channel. cheer s gorgeous
give me challenging levels and no drama!!!they cant go back to classic lara because the current devs think you should be happy with whatever they give you.I do hope embracer decides to finally do those remasters after this bombs.
this could go very bad  pretty much every amazon game as of yet has some major problems or were canceled. but hopefully it goes well. I would like a game where its mostly about exploration and not about shooting like it was the case with the recent ones. I didn t mind the new model for lara in new games  it was something I could live with but the focus on combat instead of puzzles and exploration is what made the games not nearly as good as the classics.
would love a tomb raider podcast ft kallia croft
I knew this video was coming the second I saw that crystal posted it
it will be story driver  which is stupid! perfect.  tomb raider was always action first.  the lore was built into the action.
there hasn t been a real adventure game in a while now would be the time for itso amazon s got that going for em.
I wanna wait for your review before I watch anything.  I played some of the games  so I dont know much but wanna hear if its worth it from you.
I grew up playing tomb raider and wanted to be her. she was sexy and confident. she knew what she wanted and she wouldn t let anything stand in her way. I feel like it was more woke to have sexy and a badass.
if my memory serves the last game amazon games made was that colonialism game. personally maybe new blood would be nice to reinvigorate the franchise but I dont remember how that last game was received it could be a negative unless they hire good writers and puzzle designers
amazon already is one of the biggest cloud suppliers and we use their services every day. they make much more revenue with it than with their unprofitable online shop.
Im in firm agreement with going back to classic lara! I also think they  should bring over the stories of the top cow comic of tomb raider. that comic is true to the bad ass  sassy  sophisticated lara from the original games. the comics gave her depth but didn t ruin her character like the legend and survivor series. its sad how underrated the comics are in the tr community. there s so much potential for games that could be used from it.
I feel bad for lara. make lara great again.
henry cavill is a huge nerd and is serious about sticking to the source material  its encouraging that he s working with amazon on a warhammer 40k production. so perhaps there is hope for tomb raider.
go boom! I hope youre having a fun day so far  melonie.
you channel is great authentic and truthful I enjoy your analyzes  on tomb raider past and future series I truly miss classic lara croft she was the baddest women on the planet literally  and it is tragic to see the disgusting woke culture ruining evrything that I loved about the franchise now we have an  zero from hero  lara who the most iconic  thing about is her  crying all the time and crystal danamic  say  classic lara is   ice queen   well I prefer ice queen over weeping queen any time
I really like the reboot series  I think it was necessary to appeal lara to a new generation but I do think its time to make her look and act more like the classic lara. I can see how they could connect the reboot storyline and the classic one but the legend series lore needs to go. honestly  they should just remake the classic series  like resident evil is being remade  and turn the reboot lara into the classic and I would be very happy.
it would have been nice if they went with a follow up to tombraider 1 anniversary. what happened to qualopec and tihocan  there could be so much story there. merge it with legend and underground stories to lead to avalon. maybe create a spin where lara s mother at the end of underworld was just a failed natala clone.
sadly this was bound to happen with or without amazon  like many companies embracer also is all about esg. ive got 0 faith that we will get our lara back anytime soon  if ever. while comics  cinnema and some game franchises have taken some serious hits  I think people under estamate how much money is behind this  these activist    pseudo journalist are just the useful idiots in the grand scheme of things. at this point im more leaning for it all to implode like there is no tomorow  and even then im not sure it will do the trick. I would like to say indies are the solution but those are short term options  cause sooner or later a big indie will be seduced by that big bag.
I think  imagine how the reboot series  would ve gone if it was a stand alone and the first ever  tombraider   yeah its only still around because of the legacy of the classics.  same goes for a lot of these reboots reimaginings
its actually  lara craft    a lara croft-like character designed to fit the narrative.
I honestly wish I could learn how to use unreal engine 5. I tried to learn from watching how to videos first  on how to use unreal engine 5. but they all got a bit confusing and then I found to my dissapointment that my computer does not have the requirements to be able to use unreal engine 5. I want to be able to develope games  sincerely so. I am learning disabled  but that did not stop me from learning how to use use sketchup  though so far  its the only 3d program that I have been able to get the hang of and use it reasonably well enough. anyway if I could  I honestly would make a tomb raider game that is true to the original classic tomb raider game series. anyway here s hoping that nicobass comes through with his tomb raider 2 remake. if anyone can remake the classic tomb raider game series  my money is on him.
happy holidays  lara...Imean  melonie! I wish you well from my little corner of the world!pay it forward.
imagine if amazon partnered with game lady to be the official fulfillment distributor of the lara croft schm3ckz doll
that will means that crystal dynamics will use the amazon lumberyard game engine for the next tomb raider games
this is a game microsoft should have bought or invested in for sure. the xbox desperately needs a great third person adventure game thats exclusive to their platform. and what made the series so revered is definitely lara croft s assets!
this was really upsetting because its spot on.
I feel like I am in the minority of people who enjoy the newer tomb raider games and the new look lara. the classic was superior in terms of game play but I am not bothered by her new look at all. I wasn t bothered by her old look either. I just hope the new game is good. if they can bring it back to something closer to 2013 tomb raider and less shadow of the tomb raider thats even better.
I suck at puzzle games so it makes sense that annivesary  legend and underworld are my favourites
you are proof that a woman can be both beautiful and formidable!  just like lara!   Im a fan
as a  gay  fan of tomb raider I never cared of lara s gender and sexuality and just always assumed she was married to her craft
also  I know she had romances in the comic but I dont think it overshadowed her and her adventure. I really like chase because he was also a rival and had personality. he was more of a support but no matter what she could handle her own. a great example of this is shown in issue 11 and 12.
legend didnt ruin her character wtf
@charming peasant  she was motivated by her parents in legend. in the classics  and comics  was motivated by the thrill of adventure.
@bossplaya4ever  she was still motivated by thrill of adventure  her mother simply served as a catalyst for her adventure in legend.
well I wont hold my breath for this one. keep my expectations very low!
Im so sorry for your loss.  I know how much you like tomb raider  and I dont see this going well...
hImelonie big fan would tomb raider be great if it escaped crystal dynamics like hitman escaped square enix and io made the new hitman triology which was boss thoughts on the recent games of hitman
if its in the hands of woke companies  it will only serve to ultimately disappoint you.   its masochistic to hope otherwise.those of us who realize this are just watching the dumpster fire burn.
I remember when crystal dynamics made good games  like legacy of kain.
I can get past all of the things listed about what the direction the game was going if the gameplay was fun and the world beautiful  but since I saw amazon games I know neither of those will be true.
I wonder how much bait and switch there s going to be  this is amazon we re talking about  do you think they ll be completely hands off
very excited for tomb raider
I wish they could just make a great tomb raider game
now I really want to play the original tomb raider games. I only had played the reboot games and they was okay but not better than the original games.
yeah I gave up on studios to make proper tomb raider game since reboot came up. I guess its time for me to revive my fan tomb riader project I have started long time ago  and hopefully I will make one day something that I like and finish it.
culturally makes perfect sense. they are of the same hive-mind. for the rest of us its even more reason to skip lara waller-bridge  rings of power.
r.i.p lara croft
the next game will show their decision on which way they want to go with tomb raider in the future.and Im honest  if they let the reboot character   looks be more prominent and dont go back to what lara croft was invented to be  I will quit buying their games.the reboot took almost everything that made me love lara croft and I wont waste any more energy on hoping they will let her return. it really hurts.
rip lara croft
gotta be honest. I didn t even know that amazon games was a thing. have they done any good games  are they just publishing  do they tend to interfere  its not promising news  but I ll reserve judgement without holding my breath.  I ll play the classics  plus angel of darkness with the restoration mod in the meantime edit   though the alleged leaks would kill the new game.
dont have a lot of hope left for tomb raider with chrystal as the developer. maybe if it bombs hard enough it will finally get transferred to a studio who cares about it.
rip lara
as someone who worked on the titles  Im really surprised
I will still play it but I do really wish they go back to the real lara croft
we already lost tomb raider in 2003 when they fired core design  just been watching the series decay more and more ever since
@melonie mac go boom  well thatstinks.  I never really got into the series  but I figured one of the more recent games was worthwhile.
I think the same can be said of netflix games.
@john durham  there are netflix games
somthing just hit me square in the head.the reason why they gave her a bow and arrow is so they could portray lara as someone thats struggling to survive because they couldn t do that with dual-pistols otherwise  I think they could .I thourght it was just the setting because of how its utilized in to the world  which is stupid because she s given guns that out-class the bow as soon as you get one.
so what I think you want is less about a story and more things to do.  I lean that way.  but the extra motivation from a story helps.  a mechanic Imiss when not playing assassin s creed is to be able to climb anywhere and have a birds eye view.  two new mechanics I like to see found in horizon forbidden west is to be able to deploy a parachute at anytime.  the second is to be able to summon a giant bird and fly around.  which brings the question  will this be an open world game.
if it is going to be as  good  as the rings of power  Im not having much hope for it
I cant wait to play tomb protector lol
poor lara
core and eidos   those were the best tr games of that era.
what game would yourecommend me to start off with in the tomb raider series  melonie
tomb raider of power! so stunning! so brave!
well.... it was implied in the comics series that lara feels something for sam.  with some sentences like  she is the most important person in my life   with that you can interpret she is her best friend or something more...so lara been gay now it doesnt surprise me.
they killed lara.  longliveclassiclaracroft longliveclassictombraider
I just got all my old tomb raider psx games dumped  so I can play them on the deck. I hope they at least get the feel of them. also  all this talk of  merging  and shit hopefully doesnt mean some laraverse. she discovers the multiverse!!
11 35 its true lara croft was seeking out artifacts for her own thrill but she also was competing at times with huge crime organizations and by the end of each game  especially 1  2 and 3 in the 90s  acting for the greater good of humanity to stop them. I dont understand your position or your take.
amazon can strike gold sometimes  like the boys
when youre in the process of building your dream gaming pc but there hasn t been a good aaa game in years....
lara croft getting passed around like jeff bezo s mom.
from 8 40 kevin bacon has more ground to sue and win than lindsay lohan ever had with gta5 !
well teaming up with amazon games is pretty much going to send this tomb raider bombing  its doomed to fail before it even begins
rip tomb raider... its done... Im so upset...
forcing lara to be lesbian would certainly kill my interest in this franchise s future. cant say I am excited about lara needing a team of young giddy aspirants to solve problems either... or about lara becoming a  tomb protector   which just betrays the entire premise ... or the story being heavily cinematic. seems like a very good way to commit franchise seppuku.
when I was younger I lost the only role model in my family which was at the end of 2004 and tr is the only connection I had have to him. imo aod was bad with a few good ideas and I dont think anything could be worse  I pray amazon dont push a woke and or political agenda for this or spam paid dlc drops... the current media amazon if putting out is failing bad eg the rings of power or w.e its called and they have no real library behind them to show that they could manage tr. edit  wtf. why does there have to be a love interest  and why bring change her sexuality. this is the woke shxt that pissed me off.. trying to reach the mass by pushing this  I hope they dont do this. its not relevant needed or wanted. you have to be woke to sell or fit in  fml.
that may have been the original reason. I just played through rise  and to the game s credit  it does give the bow a lot of practical applications outside of combat  which would have been otherwise replaced by things like grappling hooks  or spears in older games. what I dont like is the need to make the bow lara s primary weapon. while it makes sense when she didn t come prepared with guns in the 2013 reboot  it didn t make sense thatshe didn t pack pistols in every adventure since then. I do think that if they re not going to give her the legend trilogy grapple  then a bow should definitely be part of her arsenal  but one that you collect like any other gun. could replace it with the tr4 crossbow of that makes her seem more advanced and less of a poor survivor.
the first one
@melonie mac go boom  then 2 and 3. then stop
tomb raider aniversary. there is also a remastered collection on ps3 of tomb raider aniversary  tomb raider legend and tomb raider underworld all on one disc.
aaa used to mean highest quality. now it just means biggest budget.
never played tomb raider much besides the first rebooted one. might get into the original now
it would be better if someone would release a remake of the originals using a modern engine but with almost the same maps and game progression.
I still try the game but I really dont care for a story sometimes I rather just play games without a story cause they can still be fun without a story the older games were fun they really didn t have a story like now they over do itsometimes
I am 100  positive almost it isn t the og tr   btw that first game still holds up. this new game especially since its stated to be continuing the previous universe and that its being developed by crystal dynamics   who basically know how to make one game and one type of game only that being the mixed genre  third person mixed with rpg elements and melee  ranged aka every game that is action 3rd person shooter rpg linear mixed with open world exploration  ergo mass effect  last of us  re4 uncharted all mixed is what games by these companies are
that first artwork looks like when they chinese watercolored prince of persia.
as tr s pretty much dead for me since 2013  I dont feel to sad about this. on the other hand I would love to be excited for a new entry again.
there s no having to look for prayer wheels in the new games
I wish that they d just hire you to play lara croft lmao.
curious how embracer group isnt financing and publishing the game within their own corporate umbrella.the game must have a massive budget if they need amazon s investment and partnership.could also mean embracer is having buyers remorse by not throwing in all the money themselves and waiting how the first major tr game will perform under their ownership.if they re not satisfied  they might sell crystal dynamics  eidos montreal and all their ip s to amazon.
iam not fond of your other videos  butI actually agree with your tr stuff a lot
re  the timeliness reunification.unless they remake the past games and add them to the last trilogy charging bits of the story l dont see how you can do it.if they are saying the last trilogy was in essence her origin story referencing older stories will make it very confusing.as far as what you are saying @melonie about just go back to the original lara. Im not convinced it would work.I grew up watching the original run of doctor who. I loved and still love it. imo the stories are better  the format of 4x 25 minute episodes is better.one story lasted the length of a movie not 45-50 minutes sI the story had time to grow.when the reboot happened l watched it and found it meh!Ive watched every episode sometimes recording them and  getting around to watching it whenever  to the point that jodie was starting her second season and l still hadn t watched any capaldi. had them recorded ready to go  just wasn t inspired to.not knocking the new stuff it just isn t the doctor who l grew up with. I have watched old who episodes over and over. an episode a day. new who  watch once  delete gone.this is where l see the issue being. gaming has exploded in the last 10 years or so. the last trilogy would be lots of gamers first introduction to lara tomb raider. for millions this is  their  lara as much as the original is yours.if they were to go back to the original lara lots of these newer gamers fans will hate it.to them lara is the katniss everdeen clone.unfortunately as you have said on other videos female characters are all being made to a specific mode whether with woke characteristics or not in games  tv or films they are very interchangeable.the  strong powerful women  cast has been set.there is no chance in hell the next game will be focused on puzzle solving and exploration. those days are gone. I liken it to assassin s creed. itstarted off as one thing  a story based game doing lots of assassinations. now it is a grinding loot box rpg.for decades resident evil was a zombie game. the village has taken that game off in a new direction.puzzle game tomb raider has gone. the lara who was strong  confident quippy is gone. in the same way my doctor who is gone. that format etc will never come back. I dont see the original lara coming back anytime soon.
sad to say the last tombraider game I liked was tombraider 2 the others never lived up after 2. how can lara protect artifacts when she had a trophy room in her house.
protector of artefacts  she is.. a tomb... raider! lol
I agree  changing lara croft s sexuality is not being done for the gay fans  its being done to make crystal dynamics look good. its just virtue signalling  like when corporations only started changing their logos to rainbows during pride month when they knew it would benefit their public image.
story driven 80   cut scenes
I have no faith in amazon. I been a life long fan of tomb raider. built a pc just to play the first raider back then. but if they go woke with laura  then shadows will be the final game I play in the franchise. were seeing companies going broke due to woke and politics. I love to see core raider back.
to be more inclusive  lara croft will now be larry croft with thicc thighs
I would give amazon hthe benefit of the doubt but I think is gonna be an amazon exclusive what ever that means
under amazon s influence  lara will be transitioning to larry and will also be the first plus sized trans super hero
so I went to the tomb raider website and as soon as I go there itsays  tomb raider mark of the phoenix  can someone explain that to me  is thatsomething else  I haven t seen anyone explain this at all
the last 3 games were over  100m each in budget. embracer bought tr for 300m. they threw their money away if they dont make huge changes  the series is not profitable
@melonie mac go boom  I hoped they would scale down the scope and budget in favour of a more focused  less cliche aaa production  but to no avail.
I remember thinking  why are they sending so much time betting up on this character! they really beat the shit out of her and the original was lara was smart enough to not get the crap beat out of her and it was up to the player to make sure thatshe used her smarts. but this new one is nothing but a punching bag and I hate itso much! it has killed the game for me. I am finished with this game! I cant deal with anymore wokeness!!!
crystal dynamics needs to remaster legacy of kain games and a remake of tomb raider 2 would be cool. I think anniversary is one of most overlooked 3d platformers ever. I still play that game to this day. it runs a smooth 60 fps on pc and I love the old tr1 levels and mansion.
the  message  will be prioritized more then anything else
the only way we can get some sort of old lara back is if indie studio makes it. aside from some japanese studios  every aaa developer makes the same females in today s media. this will be no different.
I hope this doesnt become the rings of power for tomb raider.
this wont do well enough to get more than what s planned and paid for. however  they will drop it blaming gamers... its like they no longer know their audience.
talk that ish melonie
wouldn t this mean another  reboot
tomb raider 1996 is my favourite game of all time  I love all the early tomb raiders  except aod  and I liked the reboots  bought all collectors editions for them but  I think I will be giving the next games a pass  they sound awful
u will b missed tomb raider
I dont want to completely write the game off before we ve seen anything  but amazon being involved in any way  especially as the publisher... thats concerning to say the least.
yay  another of my favourite ip heading to its grave.
5 25 very diverse undead armies.
speaking of tomb raider  you d be a shoe in to play laura.
by the time she got her phd she would be in her late 20s or early 30s. the question is will she be voiced by jennifer lawrence or sarah michelle gellar.
I hope game developers would stop uglifying characters. I want pretty and handsome characters! I want to look at game characters that would be inspirational  I dont want to look at them and only think  oh my  this person probably has a good personality.
all I want is a modestly remastered collection of the 5 ps1 games  plus ray-tracing.
I have no hope for this
is it on purpose at e.g. around 12 00 to place the overlay picture  so it reads  tom raid
the art in the last comic book art killed the run.
it was so bad
@melonie mac go boom  so bad that I bought them  but didn t read them.
just give it to the people at volition. they have a good track record lol
I bet gamer gate made them do it!   dor maybe doritos gate!
given amazon games reputation of.. well being awful  I have very little faith in their ability to not completely ruin this ip.
watch out amazon. youre treading on  sacred  ground with melonie mac when you mess with lara croft.
here is a fun game to do when they release their tomb raider game. take a shot for every time she does something that the real lara croft wouldn t do.
oh God  just occurred to me that if the leaks are true then the unification is going to have lara break off her engagement to a man because she comes out after realising thatshe s a lesbian. it makes perfect sense as they can virtue single and be woke with what will portrayed as a gay girl boss moment.
samuraImaidens has it going on.
I dont know who this new impostor is  lara croft has been gone since 2008 in my mind  and I understand lau isn t the same as the classics but lara was still beautiful  confident and feminine during that era. I have no interest where this series has been going and have pretty much lost hope at this point.
hImelonie I just wasn t to sayI wanted wish you your family of merry xmas is near aswell great new year may manymore happiness comes your way takecare melonie
the only good news we got from the new tomb raider game is that they use unreal engine 5 for development
anniversary was pretty good since it was basically a reskinned version of the first game. legend wasn t too bad and enjoyed underworld for the most part  though the originals will always be my favs  except for angel of darkness  soooo buggy was almost unplayable. I have played the new trilogy and they were fun enough  but that is not lara  she is clumsy and whiny  and the combat is slow. but the real lara is agile  confident  a bad ass in combat. I disagree with you a bit on classic lara s personality  but for the most part we agree. Im so sick of these companies changing existing characters  make new ones and leave existing ones alone.
well we will see what kind tomb raider is going to be in 2023
I was looking forward to the next game.  its gonna be an lzzz wish sony bought tr.
amazon better not destroy the image of our Goddess.
okay  yes  they did turn an entertaining and unique game into an uncharted-ripoff interactive movie. however  Im actually a bit excited. even if they dont add the gameplay that the fans of the classics want  amazon has a ton of money  cd are still good at making pretty games  and ue5 has a ton of potential for that. so  at the very least  I will get to see a pretty ue5 game and not spend money. at best  I ll be able to buy a tr game that finally improves upon those classic feelings.welp  the second half of this video basically guarantees I ll be saving money. an interactive movie promoting lgbt   no money from me. who are the ones treating lara like an object  Imiss when games were games. ...and excellent.
bad  amazon had a bunch of game projects that got cancelled. and the one that actually got to see the light of day went back into early access  and then died there. this game just straight up isn t coming out lol
I worked with rhona mitra  not sure if her surname is correct  on a photo shoot when I worked in dublin. she was rather petite but was super hot as lara. after  she asked me to show her dublin. I calculated how much it would cost me and said I was busy. dope!
they should make you chief of character design
rip tomb raider
I guess tomb rauder will go the way of the .  her tomb will have to be raided if  amazon controls  it
we d be alcohol poisoned within the first 20 minutes
anniversary was not a reskin of the first game  it was a watered down playskool version of it
@melonie mac go boom  I think thats an over exaggeration. as a huge tr fan  and someone who played them all when they were released  I have also played all the original games more than once  the first one probably close to 10 times  I event still own all the original games and have almost all the top cow comics. anniversary is probably close to 80  the same as the original  in my opinion. ya they added some elements but they didn t disrespect og lara. one of the biggest challenges in the originals was the controls and platforming. once you got used to it it wasn t awful but the controls in anniversary were way more fluid and made what was super complicated in the original much easier to accomplish. this is just a natural progression of improved game design. I introduced my wife to tr with the legend series  and she cosplays as classic lara for conventions  and just like you we both think that the 2013 and on version of lara is not lara croft. there are so many cool things they could do with the tr ip if they would stick to the character. one idea I had was give the player choice on how to equip lara for each stage of her adventure  limit what equipment she can carry at one time  choose between bow or shotgun and dual or single pistols. whether she has rope and climbing gear or if she has gear for diving etc. make her outfits purposeful  the player chooses what she is going to wear depending on the location and type of climate etc she will encounter. for example if its cold no snowy and you choose as bikinI she will be battling hypothermia and die super easily  but if you pick the appropriate winter clothes she will survive  or if there is lots of swimming pick bulky heavy clothes and equipment would make it hard or impossible for her to swim etc. then add a similar first aid survival element to it like metal gear solid 3 where when she gets injured she wont heal until you do first aid. have more booby traps  wild animal encounters  puzzles and exploration where you can feel completely alone in an unforgiving environment. then when facing human enemies give players the choice about how to handle them  stealth  no kills  guns blazing  hand to hand etc. wrap those elements into a good story with amazing environments and set pieces and I think we would get something more akin to the originals while being a more in-depth modern game with a fresh take on the genre. would also love to have the mansion training area back. but thats just this old tr fan and gamers two cents. is nice to see someone like yourself so passionate about og lara. take care.
they d strike gold if they just remastered the originals  like resident evil   without changing the story or designs.
but they did reacher right.... so its 50 50
wow  lara croft for modern audiences  add amazon  now add some jj abrams and the whole humanity will sucked up in a black hole of dystopian hell hole
9 12  this art style remembers me hidden objects games genre  which I would not wonder if it came from amazon. but if it is actually another remake of the 1st  its a waste of time  that remake was perfect  doesnt need to change a bit! they should target the 2nd game instead.10 00  I would discard angel of darkness and the  psycho personality .
tomb raider fans cant catch a break.
just let platinum handle it  they seem to be the only developer who can do fun characters
I beg to differ. everybody says how weak and non-confident reboot lara is  but have you actually played the games  she does not really hesitate to kill and has a serious superiority saviour complex.threre are 2-3 lines she says that made her appear a bit doubtful  but seriously. seeing a realistic human being climb like that withoug ever feeling fatigue  taking on a whole army etc. is absolutely no display of any lack of confidence. what I didn t like about the new games was traversal.
someone pass the cricket bat  where s amazons hq
this is why I dont play modern triple a games these days because companies turn their games into shit for a non existing audience who never fans of these ips from the start
sandbox lara with mind exploding puzzles if only  but its going to be a cod shoot it up follow the corridor hand holder fest.......
so  itsounds like lara is going to be more of a... counter tomb raider  I dont immediately like the sound of that  and itsorta means the namesake of the game is not actually about her  seems strange.
woke raider  looks like abby got assigned a new role cause you can just see itshe ll be manly af and will most likely look like nicole in the dead space remake face-wise t-t
is the face in the thumbnail her face in the new game  I hope not...
didn t know amazon had a game studio. how are the steam ports  they re dirt cheap atm.
this sounds like the description for gow ragnor k  or gow 2018.
I was initially excited but then I realized that amazon was behind rings of power. look how that turned out. long time  passionate lotr fans hated it because it deviated heavily from the source material  injected woke identity politics into it and the writing was lazy and incoherent. I honestly hope amazon keeps their opinions to themselves about what goes on regarding tomb raider.
lara croft  the lara croft  is indiana jones  scrooge mcduck and black cat  altogether. indiana jones for her exploratory and adventurous nature  and her love for archaeology  scrooge mcduck for her vast wealth and fortune  and her love for treasure hunting and adventure  and black cat for her thieving daredevil thrills and self-interest. thats who she is  and who she always will be  period.
yea this is so confusing now what s going to happen with larabtw...your hair is lookin cute mel
I have no desire to sign up for a streaming service in order to play the next tomb raider game. so thats going to be a no from me. xd
they will need to change the name to barry croft when she transitions
with spamazon getting involved there s just no way it will be super woke. just no way. and Ive got some ocean front property in north dakota to sell if anyone believes it wont be.
if its multiplatform its probably fine. if they made people play it only on amazon s gaming service or something they might as well just burn that money now. I love tomb raider and I wouldn t play it on there.
they gonna turn her into a galadriel.
from what I seen if you dont have a ps5 or the new xbox or a pc you wont be able to play the new tr when it comes out. kinda pissed about that if its true.
I cant wait for a remake of  duke nukem ... adapted  for modern audiences ...
lara  classic lara is no  protector  of artifacts. she steals them for pleasure.the best thing for the next game is going to be the graphics. but they still might screw that up with lara s design.
tr2 is still the benchmark imo.
oh God! not amazon. why amazon
if its done right  she could have grown up over her self indulgences  and then changed her ways after rise and shadow. there s that part where jonah yelled at her that its not about her alone. that could have sunk in. as far as the lesbian stuff  I wont buy it if they start a misogyny deal like that. we dont need it. let lara live with her privacy intact from here  please.
ots going to be an amaziangame
Im sure lizzo will do great as lara croft.
the real last good tr was anniversary. what a game.
oh no.  amazon is going to give it the  Lord of the rings  treatment.  gah.
I dont mind her body type in the new games honestly  but her face is weird. they could make her aesthetic better with the og outfit and braid and finally give us dual pistols. I agree  I dont even want lara to have a love interest. with her personality  if there were any relationships for her to have  I would want it more like female version of classic bond when it comes to relationships.
that leaked comic art is abysmal... yikes
1 51 ya know  after you banged on about itso much  I looked up what tomb raider actually was back in the day  partly by a guy I came across covering the old games by the name of axmania here on yt  and its not thatspecial or hard to understand  its dark souls with tits  and the story is its duke nukem if he was british  gender swaped  while raiding tombs for sport while fighting off indiana jones villiansbasically imagine russ meyer if he kept working into the 80 s and wanted to make a cheap knock off of indiana jones with tura satana via probably most likely cannon films reallywhich is f ing awesome an idea Im not gonna lie  but smut is smut lady lol and if you find that a power fantasy or inspiration fine whatever lady  but you cant knock what it came from and how got rolling lolwhich is probably why they switched it quite frankly  they didnt want to inspire antI hero s and psychopaths with how crazy the world has become  and thus with how popular and big the franchise became  they changed it and warped it the other way if for no other reason than safety s sakeplus the culture in england has changed a great deal since the games come out too  where they used to have page 3 girls and werent afraid of abit of smut from time to time  crossed with some classic british aerostocracies as sort of an f you to the upper class system they have over thereas its as much about british culture as it is gameplay really  what would be the ultimate f you to the stuck up bitches that we left to form this country  one of them turned inwards and giving the two finger salute to them. and if you dont have people with thatsame classic slc and fools and horses punk type sensibility making it  it aint ever gonna be like it was. which is part of the reason why Im really looking forward to phantom fury and the ion fury expansion quite honestly  its a throwback to the days when games had balls  and werent afraid of a bit of clarret and villiany from their leadsand God damn was laura cold in some of those games  like fck that poor helicopter pilot  he chose the wrong day to be nice and land for her lolhell actually if you want some parallels to what s beeing going on with laura here just look up  what was the name of that video  hold on a tick..............lets see.....  ah here we are saints row  2022    who was this made for  by the critical  not drinker  thinker ironicallyand skip to 2 17 and watch till about 6 33 and tell me that aint more of the same you ve seen with laura
I think crystal dynamics should give tomb raider to some other company
abby from tlou2 falls in love with lara
they dont need a story and I care is gameplay and exploration  doesnt take much to be invested in it I dont need a story at all lol
awwww schnapps! next up! lara croft amazon official nft lewds!
why cant they just release the older games in a collection as well as the trilogy from xbox 360 tomb raider anniversary  legends  and underworld  those are better than any of the reboots
if they left her in the blurry line between being a tomb raider and having sparks of a sense of moral would be cool. but they dont want her to be morally gray and interesting....
I love reboot lara but Imiss classic lara
I cant wait till amazon fails at this game so I can point and laugh at them
amazon uses a very nice looking engine its forked from cryengine  but..... I have no faith in them to write a good story.
guys Im sorry  they ve officially killed the franchise.  the only hope we have of actually getting a good game is if somebody else buys the franchise  hopefully another british game company so tomb raider can go back to its roots and get away from the disgusting americanized hollywood crap
tbf  I d have zero confidence in crystal as well
well this amazon thing is news to me I knew about the  300 million that embracer spent on buying tr   that was a snip really amazon  oh dear what is embracer doing  yes I agree with you on most points the core design era will never be visited again and this is more proof of that but Im replaying a modded tr 6 aod with an underworld lara mod on my channel  now thats a game I want to play rather than this rather dodgy rehash.
on the wait on a new true tr game  go back to the classics.
the original croft was 5 6
lara s face looks too manly in that art. honestly  it looks like jesse eisenberg s face slapped on lara s body. also  my first exposure to tomb raider was tr2  they way she tantalized the audience by nearly stripping for a shower before shooting the camera  that is lara croft. why cant they just go back to that
they re gonna make lara lumpy and average looking like they did to aloy in horizon forbidden west just to get the body positivity crowd on their side... the same crowd that is all talk and no purchase.then the heroes over at nexusmods are going to swoop in with the save.
melonie mac  the answer to the question  can girls be incels
Im so glad that the new doom came out in 2016 instead of now. I d much rather slaughter a demon s face instead of the glass ceiling.
lost me at female love interest
this reminds me of the horrid saints row remake  Im not ready for this. I really wish they would just hd release the 1st 6 games  either remake aod or make a sequel following trlr
amazon games is committed to bringing players games of the highest quality...  maybe  but they certainly dont last very long in the terms of  functionality . remember  new world   yeah  that game died quicker than you can say  bob s your uncle. .
actually core and crystal both owned tomb raider as a unit and they went bankrupt sold the rights no clue who had it before square and if I had my way give me reboots of the og 1-4 and I ll be extremely happy and content I grew up play tr 1 on sega saturn  the og home of tomb raider
nu-lara is the living definition of plot armor. the amount of shit that happens to her in those games should kill her multiple times but  hurrrr muh strong woman!  only...she was strong before. hell  she was indomitable before. and we liked that. watching this walking scarecrow be subjected to physical harm that would literally kill anyone else...thats not lara croft and never will be.
well are anyyyyyy of us shocked about this nope I dont think so
@andrew haddow  I love both but yea they did drop the ball
there s an underworld lara character mod for aod ! I will search for this  Imust try it!!!
no  core design was fired from tomb raider after aod in 2003  eidos was the publisher at the time and they gave tomb raider to their own development studio  crystal dynamics. core was initially going to be contracted to make tomb raider anniversary  but crystal dynamics did not like thatso eidos handed everything over to crystal. eidos went under later then sold the ip and crystal dynamics  eidos montreal to square enix. then sold again as we know.
tbh I dont think your argument is well-explained. youre basically saying both versions of lara had plot armor  but when the new one has it its bad  but when the old one has it  its not.old lara doesnt have crazy set pieces to harm her  she just gets shot a million times  bitten by wild predators  then takes a medpack and everything s magically fine. every so often she might fall down or get knocked out in a cutscene  but thats it. what youre actually complaining about is the realistic depiction of her interaction with chaotic hazards. old lara would also survive those situations  just with more grace and less apparent damage  cause no one was going take extra time to animate draw her taking damage to her skin  clothes  etc.I always remember that time aod lara got blown out of a pipe on fire and just walked it off.
@vindifferent  what I was trying to say is that nu-lara is supposed to be in this hyper-realistic universe where shit can actually hurt people  and yet survives shit that would kill a normal person in one hit. Im not saying old lara didn t get hurt  but it was a completely different vibe and setting. it wasn t supposed to be realistic  it was a power fantasy. yes  old lara had plot armor for a fact  but in a universe where one med-pack is all you need to be right as rain  well  sometimes plot armor is expected. as I said  it was a power fantasy and Im sure we all wish we could survive death-defying encounters without even a hair out of place. the hyper-realism of nu-lara is why thatsame plot armor doesnt work as well. by trying to make everything more realistic and gritty  it goes from a power fantasy to  how in fresh hell is she alive   after crashing through tree foliage at 80  mph  which  realistically  would just leave her as a bloody stain on a tree trunk. its extremely immersion-breaking to present this realistic  gritty world where everyone and everything can and will kill you  only to see the very human main protagonist survive literal impalement in the very first mission. the plot armor works for old lara because the whole point is that its not supposed to be realistic  its a power fantasy. it doesnt work for nu-lara because its supposed to be realistic  and I fail to see the realism in surviving falling through dense foliage at the speed of a sports car with nothing but a single branch stuck in her side.
im sorry I really enjoyed the newer laura croft game. I thought they where great. I didn t mind the more realistic down to earth relatable croft myself.
if the leaks are even a little bit true  this will be a huge flop. longtime fans dont want a useless love story thrown into tomb raider. we want exploration  good gameplay and confident lara croft back. also having some curves would help. all these studios making their female characters look bland and more masculine is a trend thatseriously needs to stop.
and melonie soul got crushed today by this
with prime videos recent demolishing of great ips like wheel of time and lotr  I expect another woke fest. if they do make bombshell lara again  then I ll be surprised if  she  doesnt have an adam s apple  p
teaming up with amazon  how is it a lara croft doll is the most positive news we got for tomb raider
squenix really disown crystal dynamics.hope they never produce legacy of kain games yet. I dont want to see legacy of kain the pillars of power.also her  protecting artifacts  means she s the game version of d  national treasures.naughty dog employees loves shipping since  chlodine  ship on lost legacy even saw it in their office behind the scenes. they will love the promotion of this game but will never buy it. lol
reiterating once again  the reboot franchise would have been fine if this was lara croft s daughter and not lara herself. since this pitiful excuse of a character is not lara to me  or any of us hello    Ive just been calling her katie. katie  kathleen  croft. lara croft s probably adopted daughter  but who cares about specifics. this character feels like somebody following in classic lara s footsteps  and it would have been so great if they would have done that. someone trying to follow in og lara s footsteps.
galadriel  the game
thats a big thing.  the old tr games were about adventure .  older games were about fun moreso than anything.  well fun and frustration depending on the game.  they were never designed about politics.  does this mean they cant make a game that includes certain demographics   no of course not  but the focus has to be first and foremost on fun and thats not the case.  they just want to push an agenda they dont even believe in.  its why I ignore most modern aaa games.
just make lara look like kate beckinsale.
you hit the nail on the head. shippers are ruining video games. look at the    they did in the final fantasy viI reboot  just to make a small handful of shippers happy. shippers who weren t even alive for the og ffviI and cant begin to understand the damage being done to the saga for the sake of  zerith.  I used to like zack  shippers and this reboot  and his awful new vo  have ruined him for me.
daily reminder that melonie loved tomb raider 2013  rise of the tomb raider and shadow of the tomb raider on release.she loved the story and gameplay.dont let this grifter fool you.
Im just gonna stick to the ps1 games
tomb raider under core design 1. exploration2. platforming3. puzzle-solving...10. occasional  brief combat encounters  used as a spice to keep you on your toes.tomb raider under crystal dynamics 1. combat2. combat3. combat4. cinematics and qtes....10. insultingly small  optional puzzle areas. linear levels and automatic jumping.
r.i.p tomb raider   lara croft. 1996-2022.  although she died in 2008 imo .
I dont trust the path the game industry is taking.its more than just amazon causing headaches for us  and I know your tattoo wont be canon anymore. waah
this just sounds awful...  none of this is lara croft.  all they d have to do is change  reboot lara  into her own separate person and the series would stand on its own pretty well.  I enjoyed the games overall.  all they d have to do to bring her back is give the body dimensions slider to a random teenager.  he d max out those curves  add in some extra jiggle  and bam  real lara is back.  let him write it while youre at it.  here s a sample    lara breaks into a tomb.  she steals stuff.  bad guys show up that want the stuff back.  some mysterious power threatens to end the world.  she narrowly dodges some traps  and lets everything burn down because it ain t her problem.   there  thats free.
oh man Im so sorry  hope they listen to you
take into consideration the game is intended to suit modern day audiences. this means the mind bending puzzles might seem like absolute cake walks for you  mel  but these puzzles are made for the negative iq folks that enjoy watered down personality  physically weak male  and physically bland and overbearing personality characteristics in their female characters. these games are not made for fans of the classics. they re made for the modern wokies and marketed to the fans and somehow they cant figure out why nobody likes it.
in the name of Jesus our Lord let us all pray for lara croft... Lord I pray that u take full control over lara crofts name and image and that u dont let her name and character be tainted no more in Jesus name and let her true image be shown only accordingly to ur will in Jesus name.
this is common knowledge I tell people myself  tons of us loved the reboot games when they came out but are ready for tomb raider to actually be tomb raider now. crystal dynamics promised us lara would become the tomb raider and she never did.
@melonie mac go boom  youre a liar.you contradict your previous statements by acting like the story was bad and that they didn t sell.
overly misrepresenting. while I also prefer the games leaning toward the classics and some of the legend trilogy  the arguments people make against the current games are hyperbolic.the problem with the reboot games especially is the separation of church and state  ie. tombs and exploration are segregated from the main campaign.the main campaign is almost non-stop combat and action set pieces with the rare self-contained puzzle and platforming. tombs and secrets as a result are confined  small-scale  as opposed to being main parts of the story progression. but there are good number of them  but only off the beaten path. you do a lot of exploration outside the main campaign to find secrets  but again  not mandatory. different puzzles no longer interact with each other as pieces that each form a whole. tomb raider anniversary and underworld were a lot better in this regard  despite them not being as successful as legend was. anniversary faced you with only animal combat with a single gimmick  and underworld  barely wanted to give you any combat at all cause it was honestly too bare-bones and simple  the game didn t even have a final boss.legend still kept the spirit of the main quest by not segregating the puzzle-platforming  but it was still more linear and combat-heavy by comparison. ironically legend has a lot more in common with the 2013 reboot  and to no surprise  those two were the franchise s most recent highlights of success. the reboot games do have you exploring more than legend did though.jumping is not automatic  grabbing ledges and positioning is. for me  positioning before a jump doesnt add any serotonin to traversal  only the timing for the grab does  which was only a thing when grappling was added. would prefer if they made jump-and-grab platforming more timing-based  rather than old-school where you just position properly and hold down buttons in the right order. if they go back to make a game with more particular jumping mechanics  then jumping needs to be more of the primary focus  and needs to be more rewarding in proportion to how technical they make it.
for me she died in 2003... when she walked into the shadows and never returned. the last scene in aod has a different meaning if we look at tomb raider nowadays.
as a tomb raider fan since 1996 Im most likely gonna be disappointed
I changed my love to uncharted. its just better. not messed with like tomb raider.
I still need to play go.
pretty sure that the franchise is doomed
wonder if lara will come with a selection of pro-nouns and a female pen@s I am sure it will bring up what sexual preference she is even though nobody asked I will put money on they make her gay and minority  either way I can see this moving even more towards feelings than puzzle solving and action under amazon.
Imean the reboot trilogy is literally establishing lara croft as the tomb raider... yes she is not as confident or accomplished yet... but I am thinking the next game is where we get full on tomb raider... hopefully anyways... but yeah politics has heavily impacted the entire entertainment industry as of late and so many ip s have been absolutely destroyed by woke ideology. all we can do is hope it doesnt suck...
shadow was enough to turn me off anything new from  this franchise for good lol  so I ll just go back to playing the original games instead.
amazon and hbo are modern day movie sharks killer. the end.
they better not make a crappy mobile game
oh my God did anybody else find out what happened to henry cabell
to me the last great tomb raider game was the last revelation. I like the legend timeline but those games feel more like spinoffs. the most recent trilogy feels so uncharted I rather play uncharted if Im being honest nathan drake is a much more entertaining character than modern lara.
if they would just listen to you  we would have the game we have been waiting for.  I hate modern woke culture  and I hate people ruining my favorite games.
Im a big fan of tomb raider games my favorite.   tomb raider   the angel of darkness  for. playstation 2.
so are they rebooting tomb raider. so what reason  we all know its got to have some woke agenda. first off lara croft already demolishes the entire woke agenda. she was a bad ass smoke show that had her own franchise games and movies. I have to think there is a notice here. she ll some back as some trans looking queer. Im surprised they dont also go the  body positive  route as well . that would be hilarious a fat lara rolling around sneaking hanging from ledges and climbing rock faces . even though millions on guys played as lara throughout the years. they will still find fault with it  most likely the biggest issue. she s text book attractive. we cant have that right. because. it all woman are athletic gymnasts that can fight
prepare your self for raider guyladriel hahaha
good insights. I dont like the leaked news either  but especially this lesbian thread  which was clearly introduced because of the reboot series. can a strong  smart  savvy  independent woman only be a lesbian  and what about jonah  he was a pain in the ass in rise and shadow  and here they d be able to put a bunch of kids around lara s neck  this is no longer tomb raider.
perhaps the game will be great im willingly to give them the benefit of the doubt
why tf do they have to inject sexual stuff into the tomb raider games the og games were really good and had no sexual stuff as it connected to all ages as a kid when I played tr I never saw her sexually smh it was just about exploration  and tomb raiding
if they make her team up with students and a lesbian it will be the 1st tomb raider I dont buy.  the only way a relationship works with lara is in an competitive manner. I only see her flirting with someone to get the upper hand.
yeah  crystal dynamics and amazon s attempt to push for this version of tomb raider wont end well. just go back to the original roots of the 1990s.
lara was already established as a tomb raider in tomb raider last revelation at 16 years old  and they did a heck of a lot better and didn t have to make her an entirely different person either
@melonie mac go boom  its a reboot  so they are starting from the beginning of lara croft s evolution. this trilogy pretends none of the previous games exist... lol but you already know that... there is nothing really wrong with the reboot. why would they keep making the same games over and over again  that gets stale unless youre talking street fighter or call of duty.
they could make bank just by making a graphically updated version of the first game series. if they cared about actually making money  thats what they d do. also  how is it feminist to give a woman daddy issues
it might suck but at least they re still going to make a new game.
I see  amazon games  and all I think of is corporate product and not passion based gaming
how hard is it to make a tomb raiding game where you raid tombs and discover cool things and fight beasts and bad guys  why do they need to insert wokeism into everything   what s the obsession with adding shitstory arch s there solely to push leftism  tomb raider was literally just pure fun and it was a video game in its purest form. simple story with awesome action  exploration  puzzles and combat and a great character. I still remember watching my older brother and friends play it on pc when I was a kid. seeing them come across dinosaurs etc  its just fun. we want fun.mtfa!!! make tomb raider fun again.
I did a meme on reddit of crystal dynamics choosing the fake survivor tomb raider instead of the classics  the moderators got angry saying f off and deleted it  guess there too sensitive for humor.
at 9 02 homage  do you know what style of video games use that type of art  all the way back to the nes days of doing hyper realism art with the gray at the sides  games like castlevania use this hyper realism art. another the ugly mega man cover art of the first mega man game. and the sticker to the right thatsays year. that is where it would say license by nintendo. wow what a homage. you can play an 8-bit lara croft game in 2d. no not on the nes. for the game boy color. they are good games. which feels like lara playing on a nes.
hey melonie the important stuff is that lara croft come back hoping it has adult content like the new lara doll.
lara croft is a lesbian now.    cause...   -the message
new tomb raider over-writes manual saves with auto-saves. I despise that.the gameplay is rancid.
boys and girls can you say bargin bin
seems like it could be better if they went full cringe and just have the bosses show up on her  tinder  profile fellow archeologists  ancient evils  dinosaurs... swipe  then consequences for if we reject them or not in the conflict.  at least it would allow player choice.
the only thing I ll agree with you on is the point of giving lara a woman love interest is stupid. thats definitely playing to the lgbt however many other damn letters they have crowd. I disagree with damn near everything else. if each set  of games are their own continuity then why does it matter  each set of games are its own universe. right  I dont understand the issue. then again Im biased. I love tomb raider 2013  I love rise of the tomb raider and I really love shadow of the tomb raider. my first tomb raider game. youre saying all this about how the og games were all about puzzles and adventure and not so much story and how you want that back. okay fair enough. but to say that the current games aren t about adventure is ridiculous in my opinion. each story  each city we traveled to with lara was an adventure. we literally went through multiple tombs filled with artifacts and information on history of other cultures. ancient civilizations. a lot of your comments dont make any sense to me. and to be completely honest. I love the story about lara s personal life. I love seeing how she has grown. and I dont understand this idea of how she s not confident  lara has been very confident in her ideals and conviction. she had moments of weakness sure but so what  her having friends  her being emotional  thats normal human behavior. like I said Im a new fan so maybe Im biased but I still disagree a lot with what you said.
I got a bad feeling about this.
I couldn t care less about  new tomb raider  ... just want a kewl posable version miniature of the original lara croft. but I can only find the lame uninteresting one.first reboot of tomb raider wasn t  a bad game  it just wasn t tomb raider...more of some uncharted game.
so this is where the woke rumors came from. an apparent leak says that lara will be treated as a lesbian and will have a female love interest in the next game.
they will go down the route of least resistance   expect more of the same generic crap  that has blighted tr since the abomination that is legend was released.
every time she gets confident we knock her right back down again. yep  like the old roddy piper saying when you think you have all the answers  the story changes the questions. and they re right. if lara was able to solve every problem quickly  the game would be boring.
my philosophy has always been  f    amazon! ...so  Im not overly eager to get a new tr game if it means putting money in amazon s coffers.
the relatable version is better! but the puzzles in the survivor trilogy were fairly weak.
what about that netflix animated show  hayley atwell still a thing
there other ways to tackle adversity than constantly knocking lara down.
@charming peasant  well the first way didn t age well.
long time tomb raider fan  and long time you fan  but I completely disagree with you on most of your tr opinions. the original games are just as linear as the newer ones. they maybe are more puzzle-oriented  they were basically puzzle-platformers  than the newer games  which have some legit puzzles  but are much more combat-focused games . the newer games are not dumbed-down  the puzzles and platforming are easier  but the combat is much harder than the incredibly simple combat of the originals  and the pathfinding requires a lot more attention to detail. the story is essentially an origin story - and a far better and more relatable and realistic one than tr4. new lara is a 3-dimensional character who seems like a real person  original lara basically has no dimensions. I dont know how wokeness applies to new lara  I didn t really notice any of it in the new games.  not counting games that haven t come out yet  where lara may or may not be a lesbian  this is news to me    if I had the ability to pick  I would take new lara s story and characteristics  with original tr type gameplay  with puzzle-platforming taking center stage  and combat basically playing the role of the occasional momentary obstacle.
so if lara croft had an hourglass body and bigger lips in the modern trilogy  and nothing else was changed  you would have enjoyed those games more
naw. Im good. I had fun with survivor lara. but Im o.g. lara. I have a pocket sized clam shell emulator with the first 5. I will just chill with o.g. lara of my understanding. you all can keep thatshizz-nizz! lol.
I do like how lara looked in the last one. she looked more human and feminine than other ones I have seen.
oh hey there is a berg involved in this. doesnt surprise me new lara is the way she is  and the way she will be under amazon. its just going to get worse people.
tomb raider has been in crystal dynamics possession since the early 2000 s.   its in decent hands.
why did they need an actress for lara  she is a videogame character  just model her in the computer  realism is a cancer in videogames!
prepare for a more masculane lara. so sad really.
9 20   laura looks like hilary swank.  not the girl most guys want to see painted on a fighter.
do you do livestreams of gaming
expect lara to have a female love interest or something stupid.
I suspect the women who swing for lara want her to look better.
woke is why we cant have nice things. simple as.
on no.  rings of power raider.
amazon is where good ip s go to die.
amazon up to this point has shown they have no respect for whatever franchise they touch so keep expectations low like everything else nowadays....
well thats killed any hype...
amazon  ok... woke croft ...
what  you guys dont have phones
that tomb raider cover looks like greta thurnberg.
yes I would have enjoyed them more than looking at a wet mop  but I still would have had a ton of issues because of the ridiculous overdramatic stories and uncharted gameplay. let tomb raider be tomb raider again.
@melonie mac go boom  aaa game franchises are always evolving over time to offer something for new audiences. the uncharted gameplay has become a norm in gaming because it offers a cinematic-style experience that makes the game look pulse-pounding to players. the overdramatic stories simply provide players with a conflict. lara s climbing a very tall pole. she s fighting a panther with only a knife. she has to escape a deadly trap  etc. near-death experiences  without the involvement of fantasy or magic  that the typical player would likely never encounter in real life. while you dont see any value in moments like these  cd did a good job creating tension for the typical player without much involvement from antagonists.
crystal dynamics have never made an actual true tomb raider title yet
the tomb raider franchise died with core design. what we re seeing is not tomb raider no matter the form it takes.
so tomb raider rings of power then
they ve been turning any character that was considered a sex icon in the past into a lesbian. they recently attempted to do it with faye valentine in the crappy live action cowboy bebop  and now lara croft is next. it ll likely be trash.
it go on and on I just skip the cutscenes cause I rather play the game
the best tomb raider  are the chrystal dinamics trilogy I think
and here they are destroying another franchise... again!
this is where tomb raider goes to die....
didn t you know  women cant just be friends but lovers too.
I hope you like guyladriel  because thats what youre going to get.
I hate when they a group for the main character  like in cw with flash  arrow  supergirl  etc...
that large headshot in the thumbnail looked awful
this is upsetting. I dont claim her
crystal dynamics is the problem
it looks like I know why ps1 tr 1996 and then again. ps2 tr annlversary 2007 its the same ps5 tr 2023
these days lara looks like a dude I used to know.
im not playing any new  tomb raider games anymore!
if they go forth with the way the leaks say. then I will not buy it.
all I have to say is  lara croft should have been in indiana jones 5  if they were going to pass the torch to a female and bring it into the modern age.
get ready to see some doubling down and fan blaming.
I wouldn t trust amazon games with a plastic bag. lara deserves way better than this.
well I disagree about the story driven part there s nothing wrong with that
how is such a beautiful girl so hopeless for the future. hahaha!
oh boy amazon s woke nonsense will be funny to see itswitch to gaming.
have you tasted food that has the amazon label  its not good. this same will happen here
oh this is not going to turn out well at all.  its going to be a woke disaster at bare minimum.
could be worse  erm  could have gone to disney.
new world xd
I have no confidence in this reboot.
need more information about new game  to see first trailer and then we can say what we ll get on the release  sorry but all this discussions looks like crying  oh no crystal dynamics bad company and all their tr games was terrible bring back core design   they trying bring something new in this series like capcom with resident evil 4 and resident evil 7 for example  but all fans want 20 identical games in one style  so yeah I dont like this leaks about lara lesbian romance  but I repeat need to see official announcement  more details about story and gameplay  idk if we want changes right now need to talk with cd community managers or trying to talk with developers in social media I like all tr games if new game will be like tr anniversary or tr legend it will be good for me but I understand that all we have different tastes and opinions
thats an awefull lot of words to say the new game is going to suck hard. I agree though.
alright... I got to the lesbian part of the video... well that kills it for me. I agree she shouldn t have a love interest but be driven by her sense of adventure. they better not mess up adam jensen in the next deus ex.
but what about eidos
sigh
!!!!!!!
lara croft will finally become black.
those tomb raider leaks were fake  I hope
ooof idk about this one.
Im sure you wont read or respond to this but. did you hate the crystal dynamics tomb raider games   if so your  Ive ever heard anyone not like them so this new for me hear. as a 90s kid I was never a fan of the classic version of lara and it was the 2013 reboot that made me a fan of hers and most sites Ive seen and videos Ive watched rank at least the reboot and rise really high with rise of the tomb raider being in my top 10 favorite games of all time. so if you ve posted a video going over why you hate those games I d like to see it because Im really curious.
they mess everything up. these creators need to come up with something new
nice a lawrence craft video
no I dont hate them and never did  I quite enjoyed them. but they aren t tomb raider. just because I like the new games doesnt mean I am ok with them replacing tomb raider though  they should have just made their own ip instead of they weren t gonna be faithful to the franchise. they have completely disregarded and insulted the fans time and time again
@melonie mac go boom  first I want to thank you for responding  I really did not expect that and I respectfully disagree. just because something is different does not make it not worthy of a name. many franchises like mortal kombat  resident evil and God of war just to name a few have rebooted their franchises and made major changes yet we re still worth of their names. I completely understand and respect that you did not like the version of lara in the crystal dynamics games and that may have not been the lara for you but she was certainly the lara for me  and from what I can remember the tomb raider franchise before the reboot was not in a great place and the reboot games gave the franchise some new energy and new generation of fans like myself. now I dont know what this new game from amazon will be like. it maybe bad but I just wanted to say that Im a fan of the crystal dynamics tomb raider games and that version of lara and  just wanted to put it out there. also you do not have to respond to this comment and you post some amazing content so keep up the amazing work.
thank you! also  resident evil has changed things but not beyond recognition. tomb raider has been completely hijacked and unrecognizable in gameplay  story  and the main character apart from just the name.
so basically laura croft will be going woke  hairy armpit club  full crybaby mode
they are slowly killing the franchise by making it worse with this screw the fans let s pander to modern audiences instead and blame the fans if it flop s in sales.
oh  its am.uh.zon  oh im sure the ip ill be fine.......lmao
Im just surprised that they didn t race swapped her. a black lara croft twerking after claiming  the hand of rathmore   would be an interesting thing to watch.
this is honestly just atrocious. its like taking cj from gta san andreas and making him a social justice warrior who fights against crime through public speaking.
they need to give tomb raider to another studios. crystal dynamics is stupid. they dont deserve to work on the series.
does this new tomb raider look like joanna jedrzejczyk  or is it just me
double the woke.
she looks like the woman from control. why
sorry  Im not interested in this yoga dog walker   version . bring back actual lara croft!
ugh  what even is this  this lara looks like dean venture when he crashed in underland and baron underbheit captured him and was looking to smash.
not only do they defile original lara but now they make her lesbian  wtf does sexuality have to do with exploring and raiding tombs  I swear if they go through with this Im going to flip a table.
Im already uninterested if gaymazon is involved
I bet they are going to make lora a lesbian this time around to keep the alphabet people happy.
didn t amazon games cancel all three games they were developing  the most failed gaming studio in recent memory... wtf.
this is not good news. lara will have a wife   transition surgery.
do you think your following  youtube channel would be bigger if you joined the sheep  woke-ism
amazon games immediately lost interest
here comes the body-positive laura croft  who doesnt climb ableist rock walls  or shoot right wing guns.
clown world lara
big agree  crystal has proved with tomb raider and the avengers  they dont know what they re doing. they only know how to make overdramatic story games
@melonie mac go boom  we should address our issues with the tomb raider twitter account regarding the status of the game.
agreed!
dont know or care. I use my channels to put my thoughts out there  not for fame.
is lara a part of the bold and beautiful .to much soap opera drama .love interest.whats next .love triangle lol newer reboot .
I hope it fails to be honest I genuinely did like reboot lara and shadow was fine except that half the game is wasted the garbage story of paititI oh and lara is forced to be ugly in that game and wear the most hideous outfits and you cant change it
be prepared for woke raider. the game will be a disaster.
doa ....
noooooo!!! I swear  the Gods are laughing at me and cursing me with all this ridiculousness. gonna go climb a mountain now.
values I call bullshit on that if these companies had value for lara croft they wouldn t change her for a non existing audience
what is her pronounce now
cd  we re going to make lara gay  and make it like the last of us amazon  sold!
oh noooooo!this franchise is fucked...
God no...well I guess I am going to skip the next tomb raider.
rip laura she s ruined now. its all over.
she s now a lesbian this will be the first tomb raider game I have not purchased since the day it came out on my amstrad pc  1 year before playstation 1 came out  and yes it was out on pc before console
atleast they didnt complete massacre lara like what happened to jill valentine in the re3 remake.
lara croft is long dead and buried.laralie croftilie is getting another console controller friendly auto-aim auto-cover cutscenes-clicking graphics demo adventure game shooting hundreds of evil men  whining about being oppressed  harassed and having to witness environmental pollution while bravely fighting back tears over an ouchy on her dance-my-name leg.
lara is going to lesbian  wow thats a shocker. Im so surprised  yeah Im not because its 2022. I want 2022 to be over with already.
tomb raider is over... its been over for a long time. I accepted that its over she s officially dead......
this is going to be a fing disaster  hard pass on this purchase.
they will most likely make her ugly
I dont understod  dislike these 3 new tomb raider games. those should be laras early yers. she glearly become more deadly. I like ps1 game and these new games but I dont play eany thing that come amatson.
imagine this new tomb raider game being worse than the reboot  rise and shadow
they did lara waaaay worse than they did jill  jill is at least a little recognizable still. same hair  similar overall features. lara croft is not even remotely recognizable
get lost amazon!!!
oh no....
ron rosenberg  the guy in those past tomb raider modern woke abomination s is a jewish man.ye is right about them.
oh no...
I only watch these videos because of how good she looks. she could be talking about the best and worst toilet paper and it wouldn t make a difference to me.
anything amazon games touches dies and the way western games are going yeah Im gonna skip this game and stick with the older tomb raider hell I ll even admit I liked the reboot games especially rise of the tomb raider
when did the players ever give a shit about sexuality its lara croft  give it to naughty dog  at least their nathan drake in uncharted felt like a character.this is just money tossed at a problem for nostalgia bait to make money  they dont care about the ip
we cannot have good quality as long as crystal is in charge. untalented hacks.
everything is boring and stupid now
youtube unsubscribed me
and another bloody franchise that thinks if they put in gender  it will be a blockbuster..  sigh!!!!! they will never learn
I just came here to simp.
sexism in video games.  I can only hope.  4 the triggered pronoun
there gona change lara s race and gender ideology she gona go by pronouns now Im calling it
of all the graphic ways she dies in the games....she goes out like this...lame.
been a fan of tr since the first came on pc  lara needs no man or woman. I dont want her to have love interest period. its not the character. no lgb t nonsense just make her a feminine baddass again.
lara will be a iesbian  .. not even bisexuaI   ok.. already done with their next game  not going to buy that.
really  amazon  the same people who gave us the abomination of a certain show thatshall not be named  that amazon   sad day.
it might not be much different lol. it will be micro purchase full  with a powerful flat chested little woman who is unbeatable.
we just want the old lara croft. they just dont seem to get it. I think that if they make lara gay people will not like it and the game will flop.
I look a mess today tho  hope you enjoyed the video anyway
@melonie mac go boom  you are gorgeous today  melonie. I couldn t stop staring into your amazing eyes.
oh is it going to be mobile  everyone has a phone  right  aaarrrrrgh! not going to waste my   I ll just play the og on my vita.
lol they have lost ark thats the antI woke game. I think we are in good hands
this franchise has no future.
of course they want to make lara gay. of course.the message   literally anything else.another doa franchise
why does lara look like an average housewife
watch laura be a trans they them with a gut
hope they start this game with a plane crash. tradition must continue.
hImelonie  today s my birthday
ah  crap!
now she is a lesbian...
secretly  I wish this franchise would die. I say that because for the last 10 years  Ive been just getting disappointed all over again
get ready for a lara that apologizes for occupying land belonging to indigenous people.
well thats a dead franchise now
soooo  we looking forward to man bod fugly lara  saying that  we may get a pleasent surprise and amazon may do a good jo..... Im sorry  I cant say that without laughing.
its remarkable how frequently companies fuck up existing ips these days. from classic lara to lau  yeah  there were changes. but they were good and worked in their own ways.making lara a lesbian  youre making a whole new character and calling her the tomb raider. just fucking stop  we dont need to see her with a man or a woman.Im so sick of this dumb shit  I love lara for her personality and now she s unrecognisable
they are not going to attract men of culture if they make lara look like a lesbian again.
Im sure lesbian lara croft will now refuse meat  support climate change  and apologize every time she blows up part of the environment  gosh this is such a step up from sottr
they might as well change the game name she s not even a tomb raider anymore the last game the frumpy dumpy laura was more like a far cry game.
gay person who never asked for this. bI I would accept. I ll miss her romances with men!!
I d left tomb raider behind since the shitty reboots anyway.
happy birthday!  d
melonie  thoughts on the new hitman triology games they were great and man I am glad they escaped square enix thoughts
ruined before it ever gets released.  typical wokeness.  I hope they go broke  literally.
lara croft about to be a black  non-binary  transgender  lesbian.
cant wait for the race-swapped and uggified lara croft designed to  escape the male gaze .regardless  I haven t bought a triple-a game in years. indies only.
cant wait to not buy it.
I just want a remake of the original game that game was the shit! yes I k ow they remade it for 360 but I want it again for ps4 5
I hate everything
get woke go broke. cant wait to watch amazon piss away a ton of money.cant even play space invaders now without it being rebooted as woke  black pixels on a white background  gay pixels no less.
well that all sounds horrible  but maybe if it flops hard enough they ll make a game people actually want to play instead of a woke pile of trash.
oh I cant wait to play half black half asian gay lars croft
oh no  your girls is going to fight the patriarchy next. so woke coming in.
partnering with amazon and making her a lesbian just screams wokeness  guess its time for tomb raider to be totally destroyed. I pray they dont touch legacy of kain after this.
welp  gay lara with lesbian scenes with black gf and trans sidekick if amazon is involved
lmao...of course shes gay now
the classic stuff  yourealize tomb raider angel of darkness almost ended the whole series the new games are way better
any fool who thinks they fixed lara croft is not a fan of tomb raider because lara croft was perfect the way she was created  as for amazon if they want they stupid fake lara croft than they can go bankrupt because I dont buy trash games with destroyed characters
time for black strong female lead masculine tomb raider who is probably going to be gay fighting against the white man!
could someone out there make a mod that restores laura croft  also why a lesbian of all things  that is really really unnecessary and not essential.
lara is a lesbian now......aaaaaand my hope for a good game is gone! as with everything amazon top priority apparently is virtue signalling.
its gonna suck for sure!! we want classic tomb raider not this crap haha
here comes another woke disappointment.
crystal dynamics is one of the worst studios to manage fandoms  legacy of kain fans better be praying they leave them alone lol
women dont need men they can be empowered by being independent  however she can be gay and need a woman as thats not the same. sounds like a contradiction to their religion.
let s be honest to ourselves..this is probably going to be trash
multi-platform ... so its a mobile game   what   dont you guys have phones      -d
I would love a new tomb raider game  but they can keep it if its going to be woke garbage. no thanks
had to comment to make it 667 comments
lara croft will just be abby from the last of us 2 but any race but white.... and gay
has anybody at cd actually played ps1 era tomb raider  looks like they only watched the movies. Im not buying any more of this garbage  let embracer  amazon and the rest of them lose money.
will see if they accomplish to make even worse tomb raider game as  the angel of darkness . or even worse than angelica jolie movies.. funny tho. in 2013 reboot tomb raider  there was a small hint of woke.. only white males of the group died..omg.. now when I saw  lara croft is a lesbian now   omg that is it.. not going to buy the game  this isn t tomb raider game..I say  let remedy try to do the next tomb raider game.. or something other that hasn t fell into woke-ish shite..
uh oh   here comes non white lara  with a trans sidekick  and the villians are white males with red hats.
nice always wanted to play non-binary race swap lara croft with pink hair  thats slightly over weight with diabetes  fighting against not only trinity  but against the oppression of the patriarchy.  sounds fun.
lol  amazon games  expect ugly lara croft and mary sue personality  im done with the franchise anyway  they also gave the trilogy game for free so I doubt people wanna buy into this franchise ever again
you shilled for the reboot games before but now act like you hate them lol the content is still online of you gassing those games
protector of artifacts  right. why bother  just make every single game about a lesbian lara croft defending gay pride parades from  white supremacists  and save us the slow crawl towards that end goal.
ew...
why not letting the players choose wghat the player wants   if you prefer make her hetero  you can  if you want to make her lesbian  you can  if you dont care anout either of that  you can !  Im for the choice  as long as there are a default version.  that would be for the best.
this sounds so bad.
wrong. survivor lara is far superior character in every way to original lara.
why do you hate the new tomb raider games so much  they arent woke. Imean your opinion is wrong though. if these new tomb raider games were not what people think lara croft is then they wouldn t be making anymore them. they made 3 games that did well in sales. the 90s style of tomb raider is done and gone.Im 31 years old.  I grew up with the old lara croft games. I think these new games are good. I like them far better than  underworld and legend.   but hey  to each their own.
yes I loved the games  still do really enjoy them  but they aren t tomb raider games and Im beyond ready for tomb raider to come backcrystal dynamics lied to fans and told us they d give us our lara back. many of us trusted them and they never delivered  so yeah... Im not happy about it now that the truth has been revealed.
I dont like that idea  when the players choose what character they want then that takes away from the actual character and turns it into a  create your character  game. lara croft is legendary and has an established lore  dont relegate her into a vapid create-your-own-character
@melonie mac go boom  I understand your point of view  I agree  the og lara has always been the best and they should return to it.  its a game about adventure and not a dating simulator.  she doesnt need any love interest  I also agree    still  if they insist on going that imposing lara a lover   I prefer to have the choice.  but the woke mob always do want they want and dont listen  its so sad.  they should keep original lara s personality and look. lol I wont mind they they do it retro-style with 1996 lara s model.
