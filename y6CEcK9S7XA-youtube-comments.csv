30 24  I dont project my insecurities on fictional characters!  well said! your channel is a much-needed daily dose of sanity. thank you!
thank you for mentioning insulin resistance. people dont understand how important that is for their health and how fixing that will reverse type 2 diabetes.
my goodness  35! I thought melonie was 25. she looks fantastic. looks like she found the right diet!
your channel has fast become one I have to see everyday! very refreshing to see a young lady so passionate about something that concerns everyone! that being said  it is so weird to me that the same people who were all against traditional medicine  health and exercise a few decades ago  au-natural   holistic etc  now parrot big pharma like a religious cult. something else is going on here!
just found your channel. already subbed. I love seeing someone like yourself speaking their opinions without the fear of being canceled. we need more people like you stepping up. keep on truckin.
the first thing I thought of when I saw the picture on the left was  vegan physique ...I tried vegetarian veganism as well about ten years ago. overall I lasted a year and about the same as you  3 months  as vegan. in that time I was never more sick and tired as I had been in my entire life. went back to omnivore for a few years until dr. shawn baker was on jre. went full on carnivore and within 3 days all the aches and pains from years of physical abuse through manual labor were gone. it was an amazing feeling. I wish I could say Ive stuck with it fully since then but  I do the best I can.
I swear its getting to the point where we need two economies. one for sjw gamergate comicsgate batshit crazy knee jerk twitter driveby idiots and normal people. they ve basically killed my profession blackballing me and other artists like me just because we have different opinions.
Im starting to check out this carnivore diet! youre one of many who ve been recommending it. I never had endometriosis  but my cycle was a nightmare my entire life. it affected every aspect of my life. and honestly  there was nothing to be done. some of us just are dealt this strike in life. I didn t find relief until menopause at 40. it was awesome! I finally felt normal! like everybody else must feel everyday. life became wonderful! and Im so glad you found relief in your 30s! I really am! God bless!
damn  you a breath of fresh air. thanks for sharing your pov and experiences. sometimes the shitstorm of clown world loopiness gets overwhelming. balanced  reasonable voices like yours really help. came here cause the 1 4ing said to  sticking around because of the content.
the majority of this country is too busy working to take medical advice from talking heads on tv i-net  let alone see it in the 1st place. stay the course melonie
last week you mentioned carnivore for some reason. I decided then to switch from intermitttent fasting  which was kinda working  to carnivore. I feel better already. its been more than fifteen years of my life getting wrecked by my guts and this is the best results Ive ever had from selective dieting. previously  I have always tried  healthy  diets. I couldn t agree with you more. thanks for talking about it!I think you might be interested in what peter ballerstedt has to say about eating meat. he is  if I recall correctly  a ruminant agronomist basically some sort of cow herd health doctor. he s the expert to explain it all  not me. he talks about human diet in connection to his work. it directly relates to the carnivore diet and is one of the legitimate reasons it was already on my radar.
you nailed it! I am so glad you are a strong person and not afraid to speak out.
Ive been trying to lose weight and get more energy  and while I haven t gone full meat only  I am doing predominantly meat and no processed foods and trying to eat no carbs. its been working for me so far  especially being a lot easier to wake up and not being as worn out when I get off work. thanks for sharing your info.
I love your channel!! please continue making great content!more than ever  we need people like you making these videos and going against the forced narrative. I live in canada and its a scary fragment of what itshould be right now.
you are a light in the world  fighting the good fight. thanks for having the courage you do. Im so tired of the mob mentality  attacking people with different opinions simply because they dont follow the  narrative
on the basis of health  your journey is very inspiring! I have been told so many different diets with a lack of fruit to show from them   not literal fruit. just a biblical analogy  but seeing your story and how the carnivore diet has changed your life gives me a bit of hope and courage to try it myself! love watching your videos daily melonie! p.s. your outro song is a banger! I always play the video to the very end for the song.
glad to hear you ve gotten so much better. Ive had a lot of physical struggles and ptsd. Ive been trying to improve my diet and its hard  but it definitely helps all of those things. glad the quartering sent me over here. I like you attitude and content.keep preaching that freedom and those sweet  sweet conspiracy theories!
great video - the best Ive ever felt was when I was on the south beach diet for a year  it also targeted the fat around my waist early on in the diet.  I ll research the differences between that   the carnivore diet  youre inspiring me to go back to something similar - Ive been on a carb-fest lately and have zero energy.  your description of how sluggish you felt on the vegetarian diet made me think of the super meat boy game  to make it even harder you can choose to play as super tofu boy  where you barely have the energy to jump and have to keep stopping to catch your breath.  you should start a hashtag   save lara croft!
I switched to a carnivore diet this year and have never felt this good since I was in my early 20 s and playing college ball  Im 39 now . skin is clearing up  no inflammation  high energy  better attitude and demeanor  and better sleep. and its only been 2.5 months.
melonie Im glad you were able to find what works best for you! Ive been working towards losing weight and getting to a healthier place  it feels slow to get where I want but Im not giving up. chronic pain and chronic fatigue have been a plague for trying to exercise  even with that I just take day by day. side note  the vast majority of vegetables taste extremely bitter to me. enough about me  thank you for being a voice so many seek out.    glad to have you feel.
its always the ones who got the nastiest skeletons in their closet that throws the biggest stones.
the grift is strong with melonie mac. she saw the money thequartering was making with antiwoke and white grievance and wanted in on the action.
melonie mac is indigenous as much as johnny depp is indigenous lol! melonie s great grandfather might have been full cherokee  so the next logical step for her was  Im indigenous! gtfo! youre insulting real native americans.
I thought melonie was 19 lol
make up does that.
brah when she said that I thought damn! she looking good for 35
a real fan knows this
the human body needs the energy that you get from eating meat. anyone who tells you otherwise has no idea what they re talking about. its all about moderation and balance. obviously if you eat too much meat then it is bad for you  as is anything if you overdo it  but eating no meat is also not good for you.
@cobalt-snake  you get energy from calories and water my dude not the meat itself  so you can stop there  if anyone says otherwise is fooling themselves  this lifestyle isnt for everyone for health reasons for some it works for others dont  not everybody is the same  for me who turned vegan like 3 years ago never felt so good about myselft and felt with a lot of energy  I went from 85kg to 70 in 6 month plus training and my work inveriomnent  but unfortunately I had to become semi-vegetarian  not including meat  because I wanted to join the portuguese marines and believe me its not the same training as the american marines  while its a 13 week training there  portuguese marines training course is 9 months I reached to the fifth month  gained weight again and now im again 85 because  sad that I had to leave because I had covid and I had no streght at all to continue  now im going to begin my vegan lifestyle because I really dont fell well not at all  I feel heavy  lazy and difficulty to do exercicies plus the covid sequels  so yeah dont try to make your lifestyle the  right one  or you become the type of vegan person that tries to lacture everybody but in your case with meatps  in case you dont know the only vitamins the vegans cant find in plants fruits is b12  why  mostly and more common is found on animals animal origin or the soil itself but thatsoil must have cobalt for that bacteria to be found there.a  since companies pollut the hell out of the soil for agriculture and farming animals  those bacteria cant be found ther eitherb  no one is going to eat soil back in the day where higiene wasnt that import fruits vegetables   dirt dust from the ground contained b12 but since we evolved we have to buy supplements
parallel economy   balkanization which basically ends in armed conflict at some point. I d much rather push these people out through culture than cede any ground or resources to them.
@trustedflagger  true. maybe. but it appears to already be heading that way.  shrugs shoulders
@occhamite  I want to hope it wont go that far  but I dont trust that all parties involved will play fair. I think a cultural strategy as my safer first option otherwise we are just hoping to see if they will allow themselves to collapse without any political resistance. in both cases will have work to do.
@nate   I have so much faith in the irrationality and sheer unworkability of wokeness  that I dont believe things would have to proceed very far before the thing began to crash.all that is needed is for all the people who have borne it in silence to start speaking up - like the parents who have been giving hell to p.c.school boards over critical race theory for instance.
@trustedflagger  a war is almost inevitable  as she pointed they cannot tolerate alternate opinions and I and many like me cannot tolerate being told what to think
@trustedflagger  they re too heavily entrenched to be pushed out anytime soon. a parallel economy may not be ideal but people need to live in the here and now  and its going to take years  maybe decades  to undo the damage that they have done.
aw thank you so much
I tried the carnivore diet for a year  but my digestion never adjusted to it.  I had no problem following it  just didn t work for me.  I still think that it is a good diet.  it works great for many people and I hope it works for you!
in my experience  itseems like different diets work for different people. probably due to genetic and gut bacteria differences. one of the problems with both nutrition and medicine is that they push the idea that one solution fits all.
@alistair  absolutely agree! Ive been steadily changing my diet over the last few years when I realized how much processed food is poisoning us. health problems disappeared and energy returned. Im lucky b c I live in an area that has local farms  dairy and livestock. and really  the only thing I had to get used to was going back to seasonal veggies and fruit - the way it was before globalism.
@jim p  thanks and I understand what youre saying! it makes no sense  but I can eat ground and stew meat but steak rests in my stomach like a rock! so while I ll introduce more protein  I just cant see a full-on conversion.
@raggmopp 3377  once your body adjust  meat will no longer rest like a rock.  ir only took a week or two for that phase to pass for me.  there are instructions on the internet on how to transition to this diet and I recommend you consider them.  good luck!
@alistair  exactly!  just because it didn t work for me doesnt discredit this diet in my eyes.
@jim p  thank you -  I will!
here s peter ballerstedt s channel https   youtube.com user dulcimerpete
ahh this makes me so happy to see!
everything you are saying is ringing so true  everything Ive ever tried from counting calories to trying vegetarian is a 100  matchthanks for this  Im gonna eat so much meat
Ive been vegetarian for 25 years. I feel great. Imostly eat mexican food. lots of beans rice and avocado. but I get lots of protein from various sources. when I was a meat eater I always felt bloated and tired after eating. now I feel healthy and energized after eating. my brother however has struggled with weight since he hit puberty. he tried every diet you can imagine and none of them worked until he tried the red meat only diet. now he looks great  feels great  has energy and no longer has diabetes. im really happy for him and glad he found a diet that made him healthy. he insists that my diet is bad for me because his diet is good for him. he asked me why im vegetarian and I said  because I feel better with this diet than when I ate meat and the few times I have had meat since I began this diet I get sick and tired  the fact of the matter is that different bodies process food differently. there is a reason that humans developed sharp teeth for meat and flat teeth for vegies. we are omnivorous. the average person is meant to have both although most are at their healthiest with more meat than fruits and vegies. some few ppl tho are at their healthiest with one or the other. for those who are carnivore only its really easy. for vegetarians it requires quite a bit of knowledge about what has protein and fat. for vegans it is not impossible to be healthy but just like vegetarian it requires knowledge and a body that breaks down and stores properly. I cant stress enough that if a persons only reason for not eating meat is because they love the animals then they probably have a diet that isnt right for them. and a message for anyone who thinks eating meat is racist colonialism  yer a brainwashed moron. get out of college now  gender studies isnt worth it!!!
Ive been trying to get back on carnivore again   I did it once for 8 months and fell off because I tried to reincorperate things back in. during that last 6 months though every problem I had went away   I had so much energy   I put on muscle from just paintball alone and melted fat away.  its a incredible diet  but the cravings in the first month or so are fucking insane
sorry to hear you went through some bad bullshit  but thank God you came out the other side being the awesome person you are now.
to anyone who sees this  do you know any research  site or unI papers for long term effects of  carnivore and keto  cause I would love to read them! also  keep thinking  it is not illegal yet.
this is a great one. some years ago I tried the paleo diet and started feeling better. I was in my 40s then. I had more energy and libido then when I was ten years younger. circumstances in my life has made staying on a regiment really hard but Im thinking its about time to return. keep up the good work.
the carnivore diet solve health issues I didn t know I had.  I got on it for sibo but I also got rid of skin inflammation  redness  and a  dad bod .   the diet had me looking like a model.
Ive really enjoyed your channel  I found it through the quartering. its awesome finding people who are no longer afraid of the twitter mob and willing to speak their mind again! Ive recently been on the carnivore diet and I haven t felt this good in years! go boom!
thank you  melonie. I am vegan but I have been vegetarian most of my life. I chose to do that because I saw some peer-reviewed studies showing its help on controlling brain cancer cells by  starving  them. Ive always been very skinny as well. I did a podcast episode talking about diet and its effect on brain cancer. I am not the person who yells at people for what they choose to eat or not eat. we are all different and thats what makes us unique.vinny tortorich is someone you should check out. he s very knowledgeable about that diet.
no matter your opinion  its important to have one. its important that we speak about them. its important to have a dialogue. I found this video via a share on social media so I gave ya a follow and a like. we ve lost our way as a society when we choose to cancel another s voice rather than engage in an honest conversation. we can disagree and still respect each other.. its paramount.
Im loving this channel so far mel! keep it up girl!
congrats melonie almost at 20k! Im very happy that jeremy turned me on to you! youre a bright light  and you give me hope for your generation..... annnd Im old.
man  you have more balls than these devs. damn
mel  so cool to see you on here  been following from day one of this channel......all of two weeks ago. so awesome to see you on here and you sharing and speaking out  and letting us get to know you. remember you from gamestop tv. you look amazing btw  you do not look your age  you look easily 10 years younger. and mr mystery and rey rhodes are absolutely correct.
for cheat day food  have you thought about making your own version of tacos  pizza  etc  food from restaurants use very poor ingredients and lots of salt. every time I eat outside food I feel very bad  but whenever Imake the same food where I control my ingredients I dont feel the same.the biggest difference was fried chicken. made it at home with controlled healthy ingredients the outcome was not feeling bad  no headache  and felt very good afterward.thank you for bringing this up. this stuff helps out a lot of people.
really digging your channel! always a pleasure to watch and hear your opinions
you are incredible. if only this country had more women like you. this would be a much better country. I think its time people start speaking out and speaking up because the squeaky wheel gets the grease. we re not being loud enough and we demand to be heard and respected
Imake it my creed to never let people stop me doing things I love. keep doing that and youre never going to go far wrong. keep doing what you are doing!boom!
I cantotally relate because Ive gone through the exact same thing! still kinda going through it and Im 33. I have to say I would ve never guessed that youre 35! I thought at least ten years younger. Im glad you got through it!
melonie  you are a great voice in the community with reasonable thoughts on diet  mainstream media  nerd culture  and you select great scriptures but we draw the line at a steelers hoodie!
couldn t it be that you have both excluded something that was making you ill
to my knowledge the harvard study of 6  months is the only official study we have at the moment  but if you check out world carnivore tribe or women s carnivore tribe facebook groups there are people who have been on carnivore for decades if you want to see some anecdotal experiences
well  I guess you could say Ive been researching mainly eating meat for almost four decades.and Im reasonably good health with good muscle tone and I really dont work out or anything.Imean I do things in my daily life. I take care of many animals and I rescue animals.so take that however you like. but I think giving up meat all together is moronic
@melonie mac go boom   was looking for some long term data but yeah I will check people s experiences out  thanks!
@nocternia obscura  the plural of anecdote is data
@noah hastings  oh  sorry  not a niative speaker! Iment I would love to see some long term studies  doctors or something studying people  not just people sharing their experience seperately  which is of course super important too . hope I was correct now  d
@chad currie  there s definitely a lot of things thatstudies can prove to be true that we would other-wise be unknowing of  but that doesnt mean they are a reliable source of information as well. scientists have lied and been paid off in the past.
@chad currie  lol your definition of  faith  is very broad if it includes scientific data  which is what studies and meta-analyses are. scientific faith and religious faith are very different. faith in certain aspects of science lead us to better understand truth and the world around us. religious faith is more about personal beliefs  without the need for scientific processes. very different.
@nocternia obscura  researching tribe lifestyles and the consequences  such as being really healthy  from their way of living is sometimes better than scientific trials  most tribes have lived the same lifestyle for decades    some for centuries
@chad currie  yeap  I agree! reading a study will not make me 100  sure of something  we all know how often studies are tampered with. that being said most of them have little things that give away the lie from the truth  and  in my opinion we should still read them and cross refference all sources. yes it may not work for everyone but still work for some and it will still be valid  but we need to worry about the long term  so if any sources are available it is good to consider them!
@frappelychee  true! I try to stick to the diet of my ancestors  mediterranean diet  cause my gramma lived 93 years so I guess she did something right  dwe just have to note that people s diet depends on the how and where they live. a diet that makes an icelander diver thrive may fail me and thats normal!
@jose denis  well I would say there s not even such a thing as  faith  in science. one doesnt take it out of faith  but out of the notion that its the best approximation we have to what s really true.
@skaruts  correct  I think using the term  faith  when it comes to trusting science can often obfuscate what is actually happen.
@nocternia obscura  that definitely is a good idea  reaching 93 is definitely a huge feat xd and I agree about different diets working for different people. I always felt like it made sense
check out mikhaila peterson s content  she has been exclusively carnivore diet for years and speaks on it regularly. her opinions are just her own and she is careful not to call her info official  but its interesting anecdotal info.
@chad currie  sometimes science is corrupted by opinion yes but itseems like youre just trying to say studies are worthless and thats a major flaw in your logic studies when done right can show patterns ...just bc  something s not perfect doesnt mean its not valid and even a broken clock is right twice a day
@jose denis  lmfao bro windows peer reviewers share the same bias what do you think happens  remember they ve been saying florida would be underwater in 10 years since the 70s but no science cant be flawed at all right oh except when it is
meat diet  or something else
I appreciate your respect for others  a lot of people dont realize that diets are specialized   a vegetarian diet is  healthy  but only to those who are both used to it and meets their biology  you can find it in your blood what type of diet best suits you  if I tried a vegetarian diet I would get sick and it would threaten both my physical and mental health becouse my body is better suited to a high meat diet
lol! I hear you brother. Im feeling so old because sometimes I truly dont even know what people are talking about!I just know lara croft should not look like a dude
genuinely couldnt believe you said youre 35! thats incredible!I never heard of this diet. I will admit I do have some health issues and Ive always preferred myself eating more meat and protein. Im not saying I ll make the switch immediately but I ll definitely look into it. I want to build more muscle and lose fat  Im 27 and can already tell Im getting at that point where it is harder to lose weight and do things  so I would love to give this a shot!
you looked fantastic at every stage melonie!!!  kudos to you though for trying to find your healthy sweet spot.  Ive done the low carb cycling and weight lifting for 3 years now and lost 60lbs  gained a lot of muscle and feel fantastic  and Im older than you so its doable at any age.  keep fighting the good fight.  came from the q but have become a big fan quickfast.
I was listening to your video in the background while writing an email. when you said spank bank  I had the most painful gasp  hiccup  laugh ever. it just came out of nowhere. not even a minute a later you moved onto verse of the day. maybe its my adult immaturity  but that completely took me out of the pissed off mood I was in.
props for this fresh take. the carnivore diet is the way to go! I have been kind of doing it all of my life  not on purpose but because I hate the taste of all and any vegetables and I love meat. you wouldn t believe the shit I constantly get from people of the  omg how are you healthy!   type. stay strong  listen to your body  do what works for you!
I think its most important for people to find their own diet that works for them  there isn t a one size fits all for diets.  remember  vegan and vegetarian people have shown studies and personal stories about how amazing their new diet is.. and then others had a horrible time. this is no different  it just happens to work for some people. just find what works for you.
as an old guy  I can say the miss information has been going on a lot longer than you alive. even sam clements talked about it in the 1800s. you may know him as mark twain. he was also a newspaper man as well as a world traveler who wrote about his travels. keep fighting against the ones who want to shut you up. we need you and voices like you.
I love  we are change s saying    if you can question it  its science.  if you cant  its propaganda
it would be really cool if you could do a video on what you eat on a typical day on this diet.  I think it might help people like me who are trying to wrap their head around what a diet like this is even like.
wow melanie is 35  she fooled me big time! I thought she was about 25. Im 40 so maybe I can look 30. if what others say about me is true  I look young  then maybe I can have a hope to look 20 lol. in all seriousness some routines work better for some than it does for others. glad you found what works for you. I have similar experiences when it comes to the medical community guidelines. my cousin is a lpn and let s just say she also incorporates herbal treatments into her own health practices. others in my family as well. Im not one for conspiracy theories but I remember watching a cnn documentary about medical marijuana. medical school taught him that there were no real benefits but he was able to see things for himself many years later when they got to making that documentary. and that documentary I remember him saying that he felt betrayed or manipulated or something to that effect because he also found out that the us government studies that were being done  under the radar  indicated a stark contrast compared to what he was taught as a neurosurgeon for treatment of seizures and other conditions. my cousin has a friend who was diagnosed with cancer over 25 yrs ago and they only gave him 6 months to live after his treatments were failing him and he found out about essiac tea. that friend of my cousin is alive and cancer free as far as Im aware. that key was actually developed by a canadian nurse in the early 1900s but the government of canada eventually banned it because drug companies pressured the government to take action. if I remember correctly the treatment was effective but a propaganda campaign was started against that nurse and her herbal tea. as a former cancer patient I have taken that key and it does not have a great taste thats for sure lol.
I think that diets are moreso individualized. like I find that my anxiety is eased with a more balanced diet of veggies and proteins and such. as well as Ive lost body fat and such myself and am building more muscle as well. I haven t been eating as much red meat and more lean meats since I need to lower my cholesterol a bit. but Im glad the carnivore diet works so well for you. there s definitely a lot more we can learn about nutrition.
you have inspired me to get healthier. more exercise  better diet  healthier mindset. sincerely  thank you.
anyone who has a verse of the day in there videos and makes no apologies for it is allowed to have as big of soap box as they wish. I am glad I came across your channel. my 16 y o daughter loves youtube  but there is less and less stuff on this platform that I would recommend for her. I think you can be a good youtube role model for her  thank you.
when I was still in school  I was always taught that with freedom of speech comes the consequence of misinformation  but misinformation was seen as an acceptable risk  because the alternative of censorship would have worse consequences.in addition I was taught that because misinformation exists  it is important to develop an inquisitive mind and always practice critical thought instead of believing everything youread or hear at face value.I embraced this philosophy  and thus I dont see the harm in misinformation. its a good thing to have because it motivated you to be on your guard and to seek out the truth  while also keeping yourself humble in regards to your own knowledge because you know when you can prove something from when you cant.misinformation is not dangerous. what is dangerous is how education has seriously declined in teaching critical thinking to students  and how people seem to believe that its better that the owners of social media platforms get to decide what is  true  and what is  misinformation  to be censored.
little known fact... the food industry actually made the food pyramid and lobbied for its use  yeah the one in school thatsaid  this is proper a diet . edit  another little known fact is that the ama used anti-competitive business behavior on herbal  homeopathic  and native american health practices to make their  pharmaceutical  medicine the only one around and able to make medicine have a patent.one size does not fit all.hope you have a great day   safe travels!
I want this to work for me.  Im in pretty good shape. I run a lot and lift a lot.  6 days a week.  I love working out.  Ive tried keto a few times.  the last time I tried it I vowed never again.  I got so  backed up  that I almost went to the hospital.  maybe I ll try the carnivore and see.  but I do struggle with putting on muscle and my stomach looks a lot like your middle picture there.  no matter how hard I work out.  so we ll give it a shot and see.
I like to think Im a vegetarian. I raise really really good grass. my cattle eat the really really good grass. then I eat the cattle. feels nice being hip.
ive been wanting to try the carnivore diet but the concern I have is that I come from a family of men with bad hearts. a lot of people in my family have had heart attacks or bypass surgeries. so Im wondering if it would still be healthy to be on the carnivore diet or if that would be dangerous

Ive been doing a heavy carnivore keto very low carb diet for the last 5-6 months. Ive lost about 50-60 pounds and feel awesome. I also take vitamins and I usually have a cheat day or 2 every couple weeks when I go home off the road.
Ive been curious about the carnivore diet  but I was diagnosed with gout awhile ago and meat causes all kinds of bad things to happen to me. I love it  but Ive had to adapt.  everyone s metabolism is different what may work for some may not work for others.  I ll take your veggies and cake if youre not eating them!
can do! if you use instagram I post on my stories and my reels a lot about what I eat. these days I eat 1 lb of ground chicken  0.5-1lb of ground beef  and some sugar free keto bbq sauce. thats my easy go to for most days  then on weekends Im a bit more relaxed and just eat keto foods
@melonie mac go boom  thanks.  I ll check that out.
before covid I lost 30kg with keto and intermittent fasting. covid happened I stopped the diet and gain them again and a few more. Ive been on a keto again for a month and Im already losing weight and feeling better. I ll have my cheat days in the future if I go out to eat with people but this is it for me. I want to be on shape and healthy and at 33 years old this is the only thing that has worked for me. not even with heavy exercise Ive been in the shape I was pre covid. I want that again but this time I wont go off of it.
sent from the quartering  gonna start my journey on this diet. thanks for the help! keep speaking up about these topics  more of this is needed!
so true I agree  I was on a diet   I was miserable!!
spot on regarding birth control. my wife has never touched thatstuff for exact reasons you brought up.
I really appreciate your viewpoint.  Ive never personally thought about eating a lot of meat  but I love ice cream  so I d cheat all the time  at least I eat more homemade ice cream than store-bought stuff .  maybe I still have an advantage over many because I cook meals from scratch all the time.  but Imust say  your tangent at the beginning was so on point  I wish the people who disagree with this would actually listen to your point of view so they could learn some things.
I lo lo lo love your channel and am so happy that you are a independant woman with a voice speaking out. for me as a german more conservative gamer and gay guy. I have a hard time living through reality atm. im finding God by each and every day through these hard times in censorship and hatred! I think it helps even if im not a diehard Christian or cathlic!
voice your opinions and stand up against this culture. thats why your following is growing because we all agree with you!! its time to turn the tide on this woke culture!!!
yesterday s misinformation is today s truth.
thank you for sharing. although I never was vegetarian or veggie based diet. I know what its like to be skinny fat. people make fun of you for saying you aren t fat when you know you aren t in a healthy state.
what the government calls  misinformation  we call  questions .
in regards to comments  when you are uploading a video  on the first page where you add title  description and tags  there is a section about comments. there s a drop menu with a few options. the default is  hold inappropriate comments for review  or similar language   but there s an option thatsays  allow all comments .not sure if youre already doing this or if it actually affects the censorship algorithms at all  it might be a placebo .you probably know more about youtube than I do  though  so youre probably already aware of this. just trying to be helpful.
Im boomer enough to remember the wild west of the internet when you were told over and over again  never give your name or information to anyone! dont believe anything! these days its  log in with your real name  cc  phone number and address to have access advertising and carefully curated political hit pieces.
another rad video  melonie. I gotta give this carnivore diet a try...
keep speaking  your  mind  and please  dont  ever stop
best video yet!!!  as a diabetic  im going to be looking into the diet you mentioned !   I created a utube account just to subscribe. go boom!
big explanation agreeing with mel watched you for like a decade. I agree with you. keep up the good work fam
well thought out and well said  keep it up.
melonie is right on the youtube thing  I went over to my channel section and itsaid I had over 125 comments waiting for approval. mostly on older videos of mine cause I have not done anything on here in over 3 years now. but  yeah. that is it is how youtube does things and there isn t a way to turn it off. might be something to bring up to them one day.also  good for you  my friend. keep doing your own diet things your way. but  if you are not liking how lara croft was remade  does that mean you are no longer trying for that lara croft fit goal you were originally gunning for
you gotta do what s best for you. and you ve found what works.  there is nothing wrong with eating a new york strip everyday.  Im just having trouble with the exercise part.
we need to be able to err and realize it without losing our face. too many people derive a certain sense of superiority from calling other people out on their bullshit.
very noice one.
thank youuuu! I will fix this for future uploads!
thank you so much! hope it works out well for you
Im glad this helped you and I am about the same amount of conspiratorial
it must be hard to be one of the last sane people in an insane world.  at least  with the internet  along with the trolls you can find others in your tribe and know that youre not alone.
the way the world is now Im antI social and have no friends irl. Imake a point to not even talk to people at work. I gave up on modern entertainment I watch and enjoy the old stuff and play old nes and snes games. its free from all the crap in the world today. but its nice to see people calling all this crap out for what it is. thank you great video. boom
sadly the world is not what itseems.      I like your content  miss croft.
damn  your always batter and batter about being our voice for talk about what exactly we think about now day  all I can say to you thank you so much for your brave enough for talk about something like thisps. if I can see your in real life I wanna brofit to you so much friend
people get mad when their ideas are challenged  some lash out and call it mis-information when usually its just information they do not like.
hell yeah  you went in on this one. keep it up
Im 36 and work full time I started lifting weights at the gym but I struggle with diet because I dont have a lot of time to cook actual meals meal prep ain t easy. I try to eat healthier but its a struggle. so I get that whole skinny fat thing. lifting while listening to worship music definitely improved my mental health my health in general. I still need to get the whole diet thing down though.
keep up the great content!
misinformation  was formerly known as  fair and open debate  can you imagine if 60 minutes or david frost or any of the those had been canceled everytime they had someone with an opposing viewpoint on their show
the thing youre seeing is part of the insufferable nature of those who think likes retweets are important. the same people who will scream at you for saying something they dont like will blindly listen to and follow only those who have large followings.because in their minds  high profile     always correct and its not even funny how ruthlessly lost those people are.
Im just gonna be over here stanning my melonie with no makeup... youre a good looking woman no matter what size mel
you will lose friends and itsucks but just think about all the money you will save on their birthdays  Christmas  their kids parties  etc.
the argument is always the same with them... it wasn t the real way  or  you just didn t do that right  which is code for  it failed but I still believe in it...
just found your channel recently   I really like the verse of the day!
we dont want the n.k rea of internet and entertainment  if they even have internet   edit  thank you for doing all of this melonie   d
youre killing it  thank you so much for keeping at it.  I would suggest putting a major footprint on rumble.  you could get a huge following there.  oh the person complaining about you deleting comments.  yea  its youtube censoring off the bat.  anyone surprised
cry bullies. thats a rather accurate term to what is going on nowadays. its like walking on egg shells with them.
strong  independent  intelligent lady right here! mac is awesome!
youre 35     wtf  I thought you would be 28 and 3 months or something. I am beginning to believe everyone truly is aging better nowadays. 70 will be the new 55. I found out about you through the quartering so Im  not familiar with your past work  but Im loving the content.
I just throw 2 lbs of ground chicken   beef in the air fryer and eat with sugar free  keto bbq sauce and call it a day most days haha
thank you! I have my account here synced to rumble  would be rad if it took off there too
you kick ass melonie  keep it up!
you look and sound great.  keep it up!  what ever works for you  we are all individuals and different things work.
I engage in misinformation everyday. also my animals misinform me constantly by pooping on my carpets and not on the dame tile.
nice video  keep up the good work.
part of whythat diet works is that you eliminate most of the artificial sweeteners in everything.  even if you do not cut out the meat you cantry to remove all artificial sweeteners and see if that helps you.my wife and I try to follow the rule if we do not know what it is or cannot pronounce it we do nor eat it.
man .the lara video was so simple and straight forward and had multiple great angles from whch to view the topic  I wanna peruse the negative comments back at ya for laughs.  so silly.  keep on boomin  melonie!
praying that your aunt is holding up well.
when injustice becomes law.... rebellion becomes duty.
kingslayer is a great song  I went full carnivore for 6 months  honestly best I ever felt
great thing about veggies is you can store them in your cheek pouches while you scope for predators.
alright melonie  now you got me wondering if maybe I should try the carnivore diet.something is causing reoccurring swelling of my heart  could be auto immune  could be viral  they dont know   type 2 diabetes  depression  anxiety  struggled with weight my whole life  I have managed to drop 40 lbs so far living on rice  chicken  fish and veggies .so is the carnivore strictly red meat  do you eat pork  chicken etc
felt something was missing  so Im going to add luke 3 4 in here and then quietly excuse myself back to just lurking and enjoying the whole thing.
they can only take what you let them take.  and as for journalists  america has very few of them if you go by what true journalism is.  and now Im getting on a bit I no longer care what people say about me I only care about those that know me.  so dont stop being you for the sake of those that dont matter.
I really like the comment section at the end of your videos. the Bible verses not so much  but I dont have to like everything. keep doing and saying the stuff you care about. I wish you all the best!
freedom to make mistakes baby! Ive been looking to lose some weight  might try this.
bam! bam!booooom baby!!!!!I certainly am looking forward to seeing you on friday night tights one of these days!oh  and congratulations on having over 19 000 subscribers. well done!
melonie  its amazing hearing about your physical and mental journey as someone who is currently trying to change his health for the better. Im super interested in the carnivore diet but cant seem to afford it. is there a low cost way to get into the diet
keep fighting the good fight! agree with you about the hormonal shtuff  nasty shizz! watch out for gout on that diet of yours. ask the quatering about it. as youre a woman youre likely to be fine until later in life but its worth looking into
the reason for the internet s invention is far scarier than  most of  what its  now  used for.
I loved you when you said your age. respect !
thank you so much
carnivore diet is all meats  fish  and if you cantolerate itsome dairy as well  just not milk because that is high carb . dr ken berry on youtube has amazing info  as well as world carnivore tribe on facebook groups. I hope it helps you
eggs and high fat ground beef are way cheaper than most standard diet grocery bills would cost. pork and chicken thighs are good options as well. keep the fats high so you may want to add butter or beef tallow
@melonie mac go boom  cool I ll look into these. thank you so much for replying!!
ever since I started unI I eat 3 meals a day with as much meat  I can get without bread and drink yogurts and I feel much better compared to highschool me
the channel is getting biggerrer!!
I gained more nutrition info than I intended  go boom
I think diet is really individual. Im vegetarian for 13 years and I feel better  my digestive system isn t thatslow anymore and have the energy. tbh too much carbs ain t good  Imust cut carbs myself .
I did a 6month hardcore keto diet.  6month and 1day I decided to have a cheat day w  a box of mac and cheese. within an hour I had the blue box blues and metaphorically wanted to put a bullet in my brain
truth is true beauty  speak it become it  rock on all
luv u and luv your videos! youre killing it!
we do not need  misinformation  we need the correct information.
amen and hallelujah!!  tell itsister!  tell it!
I usually wait til end to give some thumbs up. as soon ad u said govt wants to control us  I gave u a thumbs up. if u want learn some good stuff  crrow777podcast is a good channel.archaix  flat earth paradise  last chiron also good channels.
great new channel Im liking it quite a lot!greetings!
daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king s food
thanks for the info  great video btw.
make sure you sync this channel to odysee  rumble   bitchute. I would be very surprised if this channel lasts a year. the censorship is getting worse by the day on this platform. Imade my own website to embed videos on it because I dont know what video platform will survive this cancel culture. you can call me paranoid but its going to get bad this year.
600 pound lara croftman this movie would be disturbing as heck.
how much do you lift  what s your workout routine  Im like you  I have a small amount of muscle and I struggle to put any on. I lifted weights until my arms were dead and sore for 4-5 months and didn t notice any results and lost motivation. Imight change up my diet too and have more meat  usually I have a balanced diet of 1 4 meat and more vegetables and salads because I was told that broccolI and other  greens  would help my anxiety  panic attacks  ptsd Ive had for the past 7 years. maybe the carnivore diet is the way  it is what our ancestors ate thousands of years ago and itseems like they were stronger and more capable than we humans of today.  dont want this comment in a video. and p.s. in your video settings or even when youre uploading a video  hit the button at the bottom which says  show more  and opens up more settings like your tags  etc. the very bottom option is  comment visibility  and by default its set on  hold potentially inappropriate comments for review  and this is why youtube censors a lot of comments that have certain keywords and censors comments which are anti-woke. you can change it to  allow all comments  however those scammy spam comments will get through too so its up to you.
people opposing  misinformation  tend to intentionally mislead you. these people should not be deciding what is considered misinformation at all. being truthful to yourself is more important than being accepted by a group of people who only support you so long as you agree with them 100  of the time.
we need different opinions   thoughts otherwise we are living in one big echo chamber.
youre 35!! ! ! !  I would have thought 25!!   as for diet  Ive always preferred meat and hated veggies  which drove my mom crazy. my sister would eat all the veggies and still does to this day. she s frustrated because she gets sick once or twice a year and has some other health issues for  eating right . I almost never get sick - I got the coof but it was mild for me  like the flu for 3 days...
I like how as I watch this youtube is bombarding me with candy commercials
right ! ! ever since eating clean like this for so long cheat meals just aren t worth it for how crappy it makes me feel
@melonie mac go boom  I have to get back on to the diet. Ive recently been doing a little reading and listening to podcasts. I had no idea that one s blood type can determine how their body reacts to food.
its synced to rumble  I ll sync it to odysee and bitchute too
@melonie mac go boom  I didn t even watch the laura craft video. do people really care about thatstuff  itseems so trivial ahahaha
diet plays the biggest role. I could not build muscle no matter how much I tried lifting until I started eating more meat. I notice absolute optimal gains when I eat at minimum 1g animal based protein per 1 lb goal body weight. but I usually eat more. 130g is my bare minimum  but sometimes I eat like 200g of protein. as far as weights  my general rule is heavy enough to knock out 8-12 reps. about 2 reps short of what would be failure or poor form. if you up your protein you should notice a huge difference alone. but actually track it to make sure you are hitting your goals. since tracking protein my lifts increased about 20  higher in 3 weeks than what 6 months of not tracking protein was doing for me prior.
@melonie mac go boom  ok thanks for the tips.  I will definitely give it a try and change up my diet to include more meat and protein. because I was the same as you were  no matter how hard I tried I felt like I just wasn t gaining anything and I thought I was eating enough protein then but I guess maybe I wasn t.love your channel btw  keep going. you ll be at 1 mill in no time.
I wish I could be as strong as you!
as a big fan of carnivorous dinosaurs...I would love to try the carnivore diet.I dont think I have the budget for it though.coz my diet staples are cheapest ramen  and an occasional  4 pizza  or 40k of chef boyardee.my income is donations for odd jobs in the neighborhood.
19.5k subscribers!!!!! awesome  keep it up!!
Im a conspiracy theorist as well and boy I am now convinced. making the switch immdediately
love this channel
25 50...but as a business model for a grocery store or as a doctor this is great.
I never really had problems with vegans until they started making it a morale issue. thats when I started rolling my eyes when someone would tell me they were vegan. Ive learned that everyone s body functions differently. thats why we aren t all the same size  shape  and color. and diet makes up a huge part of human health. experimenting helps you find what works for you at different stages in life. we need that freedom to be as healthy as possible. the problem with the woke is that they see everything as a one size fits all which just doesnt work anywhere.
came from the quartering  stayed for the content.
heh  watching the video on the diet part  when you was saying all you were eating was  healthy  stuff. I was thinking... just eat meat. my personal opinion is that everyone s body could be wildly different  due to our inheritance   you for sure have mostly carnivore ancestors  or your rng just picked the the carnivore card on birth. others have a better life going full deer diet  agh... .
I dont go out of my way to offend people but generally if I offend someone I can guess what they look like 80  of the time.
wow  you are 35  you looking much younger. carnivore diet is treating you well.
are you still doing carnivore diet coaching  I just started eating beef in the morning  and my mood and energy are so much better. also  I would have never heard of hyperbaric oxygen therapy if it weren t for joe rogan. what s concerning is that I talk to people who aren t in the know that they assume that he s an extremist. he s brought awareness to lesser-known treatments that have improved people s lives.
Ive been banned from twitter so many times for offending the woke. Ive had 3 accounts already
delta-8 vape pre-filled carts are great for anxiety!
we with you mel
been on this earth 55 years. I have seen the most amazing things and the most horrific things. I have come to learn their are only two guaranteed truths in the world. just two. you are born and you die. everything else can and should be questioned.
about eating red meat...its the same as with alcohol or coffee...in moderation only. btw is it normal to be able to see individual atoms  I can beat touhou on lunatic difficulty now.
I see why itsays go boom... dropping truth bombs up in here. keep at it.
Im vegetarian but not by choice Imiss  so much
is there a way I can get more information  without going back on facebook  I deleted my account because it was making me miserable.I currently have ptsd  depression  anxiety  and probably a bit of an alcohol problem and I want them gone
I want to see someone try the andre the giant diet - eat everything you possibly can and drink either 100  beers or a case of wine everyday.I think you are 100  right that the new lara croft is garbage. Ive also noticed that a lot of vegans or fruitarians are very militant with their beliefs. they aren t vegans or fruitarians for health reasons  its political. they make youtube videos where they often scream and yell at everyone. they go full chernobyl  4 on anyone who doesnt think or act just exactly as they do. I think I ll go have a cheeseburger.
the world would be a boring place without differences in views and opinions
22 41-22 44 you just named your ending verse segment. moral medication
the mac attack is back  jack! let s gooooooooo!
wow this diet might help my mom and sister
love the vid. here s the thing. real misinformation shouldn t necassarily be censored. itshould be labeled however. but the problem isnt censoring misinformation anyways. its when people try and censor information without all the information. or people who dont actually know the information but yet determine what s the real information. or people who label something as misinformation while ommiting important facts. opinions should never be censored. people need to stop labeling anything as real information or anything misinformation unless their is absolution to the information.
since some people might be having 21 meals per week  which meats do you eat
now this is what im talking about!
the best misinformation are the ones that are plausible.  the ones that aren t are insulting.
well said.
remember this line when dealing with a feminist  you dont think women are children with boobas  and as result your not going to treat them as if they are. if they argue then they clearly think women are inferior and should be treated as such.
political correctness is just fascism masquerading as politeness I think george carlin said that.
when you said you have 35 I had to rewind to make sure I was hearing that right.
you are incredible.
how long does the carno diet take to show some affect
youre 100  correct on the laura croft issue. all normal people like shapely women characters.
this is why I always feel fucking tired all the damn time!every time Ive had good meat based food end up with more energy for stuff I desire to do!
that ray rhodes comment thoooooo! yes!
I know its cliche but keep in mind cigarettes were considered perfectly fine even by doctors. people thought the world was flat. people thought avalanches happened because they made a God mad. anyone that broke this mold was considered crazy.
the first thing a cult does to new members is cut off all meat  it makes humans way more mentality mailable.
even labeling things as misinformation can be a problem because it involves a person  or group  having the authority to determine what is true and what is misinformation. as the past two years have shown us  this can easily be driven by politics  money  and the desire for control. the best way to fight misinformation is not by trying to silence label it  it is by spreading the truth as a counter argument.
all your pictures look pretty healthy  but your most current one looks most evenly proportioned.
your skin and hair looks much better on the all meat diet.
I agree with most of this video but I have to mention tho  you can definitely store protein as fat if you over eat... I get that most people dont over eat because of the sense of satiety you get from it being better than what you would get from carbs or fats  but that doesnt mean its impossible to store it
right! I do not watch your verse of the day segments.  just not for me  so I dont watch them.  that does not stop me from watching the other parts of your vides.  I am not offended and dont care that you do this.  I just dont watch what I choose not to watch.  keep up the good work!
animal food   1 apple is what I do  its great
everyone s body is dependent on something. your body is dependent on this diet now. I say you do you. nobody should tell anyone how to live.
truth is authority   authority is not truth
the real problem of humanity is the following  we have paleolithic emotions  medieval institutions  and God-like technology.  -  edward o. wilson. think about that and the more you learn about yourself and humanity in general  the more you ll realize how a lot of our rushed new discoveries are in some ways in a sharp contrast with what s good for us. we need to be able to understand what s good for us and often  thats not what the latest newsletter is telling us or what can be considered as common sense for some. we need to share information as much as we can! keep it going
lara croft was climbing ancient ruins before uncharted.
I bet without the cgI filter on your camera  youre still gorgeous melonie.
excellent commentary. misinformation  is just a kooky-lib excuse term for censoring information kooky-lib s dont like.I swear  I thought from your appearance that you were 20-25 yrs old.brains beauty  character.... youre the entire package!btw  if the diet is working for you  certainly stick with it  but I strongly suggest you supplement with a bulk fiber  like a tsp or two per day of pysllium powder.  high meat diets can cause diverticulitis  and you can end up with a colostomy bag and in need of a bowel resection. I know of a couple of people this happened to  they almost died. but that fate is so easily avoided..
ah  I see you are an immortal. I too  am an immortal that doesnt age.
...I have weaknesses too  judging from the lecture given in this video as well as the leftmost of that trio of images I would bet a lot of money that at least one of those weaknesses is or was physical strength  ily melanie with your proving that gamers dont have to be racist or sexist  unless they play cod  waw ffa in game chat  and or crazy leftists
s-p-i-r-i-t! spirit! let s hear it! let s go!
Ive also had insanely good effects on carnivore. people who haven t suffered can be quite good at judging  its easy to do so. if you have suffered   been in hell you ll  hopefully  been forced to learn a thing or two. not only that  but you might be willing to try and do whatever it takes get your ass outta your suffering. it f cking sucks when you  suffer  hell ain t a fun place to be in.  sadly  for the last few months Ive eaten way to much garbage and all the nasty stuff is slowly but surely coming back  this vid was exactly what I needed  thank you! youre inspiring me to do and be better. joshua 1 9 did hit me like a ton of bricks   in a good way. again  thank you!!! keep up the the good work  you deserve all the happiness  love  strength and beauty in the world.
fire!
thats a pretty normal response to taco bell.. for everyone.
imho  Ive seen loads of sick vegetarians and they re all doing it low-carb. every healthy vegan Ive known eats a starch based diet without added fats. oatmeal  potatoes  bananas  etc. are the staples of a healthy diet. that being said  I have also met some people who found they did everything the healthy vegans do but were still depressed until they added fish back into their diet. like dairy adaptations itseems likely thatsome people are more adapted to meat consumption than others.
great video!
what I kinda want to know is how this girl is single. she s a bombshell gamer with what seems like a killer sense of humor and open mind. hit me up on twitter mel! Im tryna marry your face
I dont have a filter on my camera  but it is blown out a little bit from my monitor lol
misinformation has been going on for years. but in the wrong ways. when it comes to airplanes  cars  computers and and phones.  the amount of misinformation is shocking. so the question is what is misinformation vs what is not. when it comes to health there is no such thing because every person is different.
true
I dont care how dangerous freedom is. freedom is what I want. freedom is what we deserve. freedom is what we need.
misinformation  is just a convenient excuse to silence someone who disagrees with you. none of the high profile people accused of misinformation have said anything that is objectively untrue. and in many cases the things being called misinformation a year ago are now accepted as true.
what a delight she is
remember this kids.  vegetables are what food eats.  everyone that has been attacked by a mountain lion has been a vegetarian.
I like your style
my two biggest fears in life is going blind  and becoming allergic to red meat like after getting bit by a tick. people can choose to eat like a herbivore  and live like easily manipulated prey...or they can eat like a carnivore and stand at the top of the food chain as an apex predator. as they say  you are what you eat.
discussing different opinions or opposing facts is not  misinformation .  jre is showing diversity of ideas.  this is the type of diversity a free country needs.
I was looking at lara behind you... what d you say bad joke. I dont know anything about you  but Im happy for your mental and physical health.
hey mel I just want to let you know that I do agree with you on you can share what you want to talk about bunch of opinion on the topics that you got on your mind and it is okay  for you to share it with us on twitch   twitter   youtube channel  ok mel. anyway its a free state   free country to share your thoughts   opinions on social media internet  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that   let you know that it is ok to share your thoughts   opinions on social media with us your friends  me   ok mel. anyway hope you understand what I am trying to say to you on this topic   I do hope you agree with me on my thoughts about this topic  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day   evening with your parents   with your aunt  ok mel.
beautiful
I swear some of these people wanna be pets.  be locked up  fed and taken care of.  with the occasional stroll. and I have multiple medical conditions.  and the periods of times that I have felt the best.  has been when Ive been able to sustain a carnivore diet  although keto was close. but where I live is harder to sustain.  not just for accessibility but cost.  the thing about diet. is that they are very tied to the person genetics. thats why so many people in areas of the world are allergic to stuff like sea food  while in others many people live only on that and are healthy.  or yeah  some people dont process meat so well.  and are fine with the rest of the food.  but there are many people that dont tolerate stuff like grains wheat or vegetable.  but will feel perfect when their diet is high on meat.  because that is what their body needs.  our bodies needs are link to our ancestry.   and there are times when the local common food is not what our ancestor had been eating for centuries.  I have never believe in the goverment recommended diets.  because I saw what my grandparents ate.  and my gramps is 90 and he is in better shape than my dad.  he walk  is very quick witted  still drive and function like he did when he was 60.  my grandma die of 99 and nave aunts that lasted well over 100 years.  and they did not adhere at all to what the  pyramid  said.  and on the other side.  my mom and other family members are easily sway and brain washed.  by whatever the tv and the goverment says is good.  cause  experts  and those that eat  healthy  are always all screw up with conditions flaring up all the time.  my mom was the same  and the time I was the one controlling the diets  cause I was the one cooking and shopping for the family. many of her conditions got under control or disappear.  and her cholesterol and everything was fine.  and now that I cant.  she is back to  eating healthy  and she has gain considerable weigh since then.  all her conditions are a mess and have a couple new.  and no matter how much you try to reason with her she wont budge.  cause the  experts  and the doctors.  and she knows better than you cause shes older and has lived longer.  and you should take her advice instead.  after years of that Im like.  yeah  you do you. just dont complain to me.  people really need to understand that there is no one right diet.  although we can all agree than eating bread 10 times a die is not good.  oh and about ra.  thing is  that diet will help prevent your mom from damaging further her joints.  but she can never get back to 100 cause of extended periods of joint damage.  but not getting worst is already a win on itself.  and without further inflammations pain get under control.
19 52okay  can I clone you now   as a hardcore libertarian  thats hot.
you want rage inducing check out  the enteral nutrition industry. a decade on that crap made my mom obese  malnourished  lethargic and just plain unhealthy. we switched to a keto shake diet. started with the slimfast and eventually found a better one. everything improved. she eats way more and has lost weight. yet the dieticians continue to tell us we are wrong despite the freaking evidence. yeah we re totally paying for this expensive power rather than getting insurance paid pancake batter because we are too dumb to understand the science. sorry for ranting. anyways subscribed.
forcing is new era
I love a lot of the carnivore diet. but Im tired of the blanket attack on carbs and grain  as someone who grinds my own whole wheat and makes bread with just five simple ingredients. humanity has been supplementing our diet with grains since we developed agriculture  yet its only the last hundred or so years when we started being so unhealthy.
meat has cholesterol.cholesterol is necessary to produce testosterone.testosterone makes you more confident and less timid.makes sense that meat made you less timid.
35 years old my ass more like 22

youre 35    wow thought you were in your early 20 s  also everything you said  it makes a lot sense why there is this weird push towards not eating meat.
or becoming woke doesnt seem so good either
yup
@melonie mac go boom  God bless ya!
I think it just depends on the person. I cannot tolerate carbs without issues  but some people can
now the spiritspeaketh expressly  that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith  giving heed to seducing spirits  and doctrines of devils  speaking lies in hypocrisy  having their conscience seared with a hot iron  forbidding to marry  and commanding to abstain from meats  which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. for every creature of God is good  and nothing to be refused  if it be received with thanksgiving  for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.   1 timothy   4 1-5   kjv
taking a good look at the people pushing the vegetarian vegan lifestyle should be all anyone needs to understand whether it is a good idea or not.
I blame hollywood and the mafia
you are awesome. Ive been subbed since jeremy made his video. now  I understand why the wokies are coming after you. you are beautiful  you like femininity  you quote scripture  and now you are talking about eating meat. you are evil  in their eyes . keep up the good work.
Im joe rogan  Im going to say the n word.  - flashgitz
so  at the very basic  this channel is about an attractive woman reviewing video game and movie stuff  talking about politics  health and nutrition  the Bible... ok  time to start bothering nerdrotic to take you to fnt. I think you d fit right in. keep up the great work.
I also know multiple people whom have had major health improvements after going on a carnivore diet.  not even joking when I say I am actually extra curious about woke people s diet!  God let our ancestors build up a carnivore diet  we have genetic similarities to apes and monkeys  but not being identical is exactly why we should not eat exactly like them.  best buhweeve our ancestors were way skronger than us on average.  according to professional studies on ancient women  they had way more upper body strength  explains why there were so many female warriors back then  we dont even know them all .  but more avoidance of how they ate increased over time  particularly the clean animals  as mentioned in scripture which are scientifically backed  scripture is so good at being scientifically backed  especially with cosmic stuffs .there is no one thing that works for everybody regarding food  but there is a middle ground of carnivore and keto... say it with me if ya know it  know it if ya say it with me...  balance!
love the vid!!!!
speaking of diet take a look at the food pyramid. ever noticed that the bread and vegetables part should be swapped  but they never do that  because a lot of farmers in the us grow grains and the equivalent to make bread  your diet as indicated by your profit driven government...what could possibly go wrong  idiocracy anyone
some people prefer to live in echo chambers  and never get challenged by life. and its because they cant handle having bad days. I suspect a large majority of them are bi-polar.
2 20 wait they gave you crap over making a statue of your favorite charachter  and you got backlash about it  Jesus this feels like that episode of the simpsons where marge campaigned against the itchy and scratchy videogame that influenced maggie to go nuts with her openly trying to attack homer like she saw in the videogame  only to have them then go after the statue of david that was being brought in to springfield  just because he was nude and wont someone think of the children  with marge going hey what s the big deal  its art and just a statute of a nude guy and not something interactive that could influence a kid like that game didactually I never realized how biased that episode was now that I think of it  point was well taken though kids shouldnt be playing mature rated videogames as they do influence them  heavily so  such as what happened with those kids who played slender  and then tried to do that crap in real life  but to go after a statue  a statue a fan girl dida lesbian hyper religious one no less too  as Im sorry lady their is no way your straight with how you talk of her and your desktop you showed briefly in one of the videos that had a straight up old school pin up of herbut Jesus we really are living in parody world when an otaku cant even otaku properly anymore lol
I would go on the carnivore diet if it wasn t for the fact that excess meat in my diet gives me digestive issues. carnivore definitely is not something that fits for everyone  and I need insoluble fiber in my diet in some way or another.
you want to see if you are getting stronger. try opening jar of spaghettI sauce. lol
you ll probably find that most woke people have tendencies to been dictators or communists because they are the only ones who try to stop freedom of speech of association and of religion. one thing I dont like about your videos is the Bible insert however that wont stop me from watching you you are good at what you do and just because I disagree with religion doesnt mean I will stop you from exercising your right we are allowed to disagree on things it would be boring if we all agree with each other.
6 15 we live an era of cowardice and the mob is taking advantage of it.  naomI wolf  feminist author born in 62  had the same experience of people dming her telling her how brave she was for speaking out and she wrote a column on her substack   Im not  brave  youre just a p---y.
I love the title of this video. we do need  misinformation .individuals should be allowed to decide for themselves what they believe. to hell with the modern day puritans trying to tell everyone what to think.
its not the government s job or place to tell us what is and isn t misinformation  especially when its their job to create misinformation.
I eat mainly deer anymore. I hunt and harvest up to 3 deer a season. had to buy another freezer
meat is huge for human health  everything else should just be utilized for flavor  medicine  entertainment  and or to delay starvation. vegetables dont want us to eat them  which is obvious when you consider the multitude of known carcinogens they contain.
yep calling you antI something. totally understand that one.

in regards to the tactics employed by the wokies  here is a summary of joseph gobbels   hitler s cheif of propoganda  by hugh trevor roper.   there is no point in seeking to convert the intellectuals. for intellectuals would never be converted  and would anyway  always yield to the stronger  and this will always be  the man in the street.  arguments must therefore be crude  clear  and forcible  and appeal to emmotions  and instincts  not the intellect. truth was unimportant  and entirely subordinate to tactics  and psychology.  now  the important thing to consider is thatsociety is not in reality what the powers that be are trying to desperately trying to convince us it is.
about being a vegetarian...didn t work out too well for the chinese when they confronted the huns. not only were the huns stronger because of their diet  but they also were healthier and taller as well. seriously kids...if you are a true patriot you  will  question your government.

I legit thought the picture on the left was of kelsey lewin lol
u def put on a lot of muscle mass. good jaabb
35  damn! you come across as 25 at most! this meat-centric diet is clearly a good thing.
are you ever going to have people with differing opinions on  like Im all for folks speaking their mind  but there has to be some discourse on here. there are limitations when it comes to just responding to tweets youtube comments etc.
I had no idea youre 35.  I thought early 20 s...
hmm  maybe I should take potatoes out of my meat and potatoes diet.
yeah girl.
people still think avocados are bad for you.
go boom!
we have brains  I know you have to have noticed the huge amount of npcs there are...
I keep asking what misinformation did rogan spread
wtf  you are 35 Jesus Christ  I hope I look that good at 35. what the hell.
you look healthiest in the middle pic.
yeah I d love to  but so far the only comments I get from people who disagree are so psychotic and unhinged. if anyone wants to leave reasonable comments without throwing tantrums Im happy to feature them ol
@melonie mac go boom  wouldn t those people be the best people to have on though  like if you want to prove how  psychotic  and  unhinged  these folks are  wouldn t it make sense to have them on so your fan base can see for themselves  just a thought.
lol no  skinny fat is not healthy
@melonie mac go boom  I didn t say it was. just offering my two cents.
do you have fast metabolism  melanie mac go boom
19 38listen to the audio drama with folded hands or harrison bergeron...we re headed for both of these at breakneck speed in our pursuit to becoming west korea and worshiping the clinton family as de facto living Gods.
meat is good!
hI  I didn t find your of link in your description please fix that.
I dont think taco bell makes for a reliable example or gage. their meat  vegies  everything is nutritionally garbage. tastes great  I often get cravings  but I dont know of anyone that eats that ...  stuff  and comes away feeling healthy. what s thatsaying  every moment of pleasure should be accompanied by an equal measure of pain. thats taco bell. addition  I think you d make an excellent lara croft.
becon has fat does it effect the diet badly
where do you get your fibre
may I get your diet plan
does carnevor diet means u eat meat 3 times a day  not familiar how it works
mel love ya
gina sent me here from twitter
boom
32 24 yes.
lol at the way u pronounce gibberish
we need a 350 lb lynn croft the long lost tran sibling of lara croft to save the day
do you still take vitamins
this is a great example for most people  her diet works for her unique set of problems  but do not take diet tips from someone who swells up from eating cake and pizza. is this vid misinformation  not for people with her special conditions  but cholesterol is linked to all the top causes of death. so just do research  dont follow 1 anecdotal source.
thought you were maybe 27 !
so I have seen a lot of people leave the vegan diet because  like she said  they felt like they were going to die. I haven t heard people leave the carno diet. I am still of the opinion we need both plants and meat in our diet but I personally feel healthier when most of my plate in meat. has anyone heard of negative results from the carno diet edit  when it comes to what health administrations say about healthy diets I think it isn t just scientific it is also political and a bunch of people with hyper focused knowledge. there aren t enough scientists who are  jack of all trades but a master of none .  some vegan statistic will say there are health benefits to going vegan  but what they fail to do is point out the cause as to why that is true. by going vegan you have now stopped going to fat food. fast food is very bad for a lot of people s life styles. it wasn t the vegan diet that directly improved your health. having statistics without the proper understand of where the actual causes are is how a lot of people play politics science these days.
fat is good for you and an essential macronutrient  just dont overdo it or you will gain weight. carbs are what are more harm than good for most people  but fat should not be demonized as it is absolutely needed.
@melonie mac go boom  I like fried big and fried beacon
@melonie mac go boom  how about drinks like orange juice and fanta zero
@melonie mac go boom  either way I give it a try
@melonie mac go boom  I have another question to frie meat is using plant oil  its cause in out country most common oil is rapeseed oil  bad or doesnt matter  should I use animal fat instead
dont get it and dont need it - doing much better without it
@melonie mac go boom  awkward question but  uh  are you able to go to the bathroom ok  thinking of going keto myself lol
if you use instagram I post on my stories and reels a lot about what I eat    but its pretty simple these days. monday - friday I eat about 2 lbs of ground meat  chicken and beef  with some sugar free keto bbq sauce and 3 scoops of collagen powder throughout the day in my g fuel hydration drinks. then on the weekends I am more relaxed keto and make stuff like keto lasagna and eat a rebel keto ice cream haha
@melonie mac go boom  I actually dont use any social media sites what-so-ever   but thanks for responding... so  you just cook up the meat and eat it with nothing else  save the sauce
you eat when youre hungry and dont eat when youre not hungry  there s no set amount of times you have to eat. dr ken berry on youtube has lots of good info if you want to study more
@melonie mac go boom  l like to know is sugar free lemonade  example fanta zero and coca-cola zero  and ice-cream  and brown bread not allowed with carnivore diet  cause so far I have eaten 2 times a day awry day 3 slices of brown brad with smoked sausage or boiled eggs so I like to know do I half to cut this out to from my menu
I love her so much
yup exactly. the only people Ive seen leave the carnivore diet either had histamine intolerances that made it difficult or they just quit because they missed junk food while still knowing carnivore was better for their health haha
wait  are you a yinzer
thats why the new g4 failed.
melonie looks like greta thunberg without make-up.
100  facts and 100  agree. the quiet majority can not continue to stay quite  we are indeed being overrun by the loud obnoxious minority. I am supportive of and all for everyone living their best life and being happy. but not by forcing your beliefs and values on everyone else. all of the fringe lifestyles of society should not be trying to force or normalize all of this. advocate for acceptance like us older generations did  but stop forcing it. and stop playing the victim while bashing others. and I say this as a pansexual member of the lgb community. but I am not a loud obnoxious in your face activist about it.this goes for dietary lifestyles as well. everyone has different dietary needs. some can be vegetarians and vegans  others literally cannot because it is destructive to their bodies. a relative s doctors keep telling them they need to eat meat and they wont  even though it is literally killing them.  @melonie mac go boom  have you heard of nutrition diet based on blood type  that one is interesting. so happy you found what works for you. and just because someone has preferences in a given subject  doesnt mean they are discriminatory against what does not fit their preference.wish people could get this concept through their thick heads  that everyone needs to find what works for themselves  and nothing is a cure all or one size fits all. and that goes for literally everything. let people live their damn lives and stop trying to mold them to your ideology.
did you see the uncharted movie melonie
20 04 why you gotta call out my bae tiny tina like that  https   www.youtube.com watch v im44g8pdqlw
bro my uncle blocked me on facebook because I wrote under his post that the canadian trucker convoy was 99.9  peaceful. thats literally all I wrote and he blocked me! people like this want to live in an ideological bubble.
talk about misinformation I thought you were in your twenties lol
I know your a croft fan. but where you ever a sailor scout
thats why we need body positivity group and flat-earthers people until they find the true and the real information.cant wait to see the comment section be like    but but yur not a real doctor !
sjw  I dont get it...all those people are saluting hitler! they must have been brainwashed or something...me  so what do you think about the trucker caravan
hey  not trying to be a creep or anything  but your journey pics... there s not one where were you look bad. endometriosis is curable... have a kid  seriously. wife s family has it  awful disease. birth control dangerous  caused my wife to lose her gallbladder and long-term effects still bad. anyhow  u b doing great boom.
they killed an elder woman in canada with a horse
please keep speaking. dont sweat the morons trying to shut you up. talk about whatever you want as loud as you want. I wish I had your courage to do so as well but I dont.
why did the statue not have the guns              why!!!!!!!!
wow great segment you are a living billboard for carnivore diet no way do you look close to 35 you hit it right about federal  govt discouraging meat consumption best example obamo  administration claim that millions of acres out west that ranchers had used over 100 years was not properly paid for after increasing fees it went from millions  of animals to zero usage by 2016
plenty of protein through diet. you will start bulking up. but please for the love of mike  do not get bulky like female body builders. please.
I dont understand citizen. just as the sciencehas always been settled  we have always been at war with eurasia
based
I am going to say something extremely harsh and hurtful to some people. the people who remain silent out of fear because they dont want the mob coming after them are craven cowards and history has seen this type of person before. these are the people who stood silent as the nazI s rose to power. they are the people who stood silent and did nothing when millions of ukrainian farmers had their land and food stolen and were starved to death by the bolsheviks. these people are the silent frightened witnesses who watched as tens of millions of innocent chinese citizens were segregated  ostracized  discriminated against  and finally worked to death in mao s cultural revolution and the great leap forward.to the people that are staying silent out of fear of the mob  when do you think this is going to get better  your silence empowers them. do you think melonie and her channel are going to silence all these leftist terrorists  your lack of action is giving the leftists your tacit approval of their oppressive and discriminatory actions. youre hoping people like her save you all the while your silence works against her and the people standing up to these terrorists. america used to be the land of the free and home of the brave  if you want to know why it isn t any more go look in the mirror. the person looking back is a frightened coward that wont stand up for himself or herself.
nooope lol
is it any good
yes! sailor mars was my liiiife until lara croft came around haha!
@melonie mac go boom  okay then I love you.
oh no she died ! ugh I cant believe what is happening lately  just evil
@melonie mac go boom  super evil! they re even talking about taking people s pets from the convoy and euthanizing them.it doesnt get more evil than that in general
women dont get bulky unless they try exceptionally hard to  and even then most simply cannot. we do not have the adequate testosterone to do so.
@melonie mac go boom  thanks for info. you are very pretty small or at the shape you are in now. keep up the great work. you are a help to many people!
I believe God created man and female. they had no clothes. when they ate the fruit  then  the clothes came.
you descent
of
oh my you are so skinny  even at extra 20lbs. say what! you are 35  get out. you look like your in your early 20s.
