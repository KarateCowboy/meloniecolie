apparently kathryn bigelow doesnt exist  she s been directing action movies  horror movies  and war movies since the 1980s  and no one has stopped her from doing it because she s not a man. she s actually a draw for those sorts of movies. I bet she d be allowed to do a mission impossible movie if she wanted  because she did the work and built a reputation. she also generally doesnt make an issue of her gender.
I recall kristen stewart giving an interview where she said they made the film hoping to  defeat the male gaze  so they were dressed up to look like tax accountants  librarians and octogenarians. mission accomplished kristen--few males paid money to gaze at you in this one.
society is the most confusing these days. these same people say  women should be allowed to wear whatever they want even if its sexually provocative   yet when it comes to movies tv videogames they say  women cant be sexualized. male gaze bad!
its funny how elizabeth banks drove away male audiences and men we re like  okay  deuces!  and she was like  why didn t men support my film  . the brain hemorrhaging that this woman has.
avoid the male gaze   they got their wish! lots of male gazes avoided at the box office.  the entire premise of charlie s angels was they were able to go undercover and use their sexiness and femininity to facilitate the mission by co-opting the  male gaze  of their target. they were inconspicuous because the villains weren t expecting their nemesis to be a pretty female  and a trained weapons expert and martial artist on top of that!she removed the fascination of the characters and wonders why no interest.
imagine making an action movie and telling men not to go see it. now imagine making a romance movie and telling women not to go see it. it just doesnt make sense.
elizabeth banks  men  this movie isn t for you. men  alright. elizabeth banks   shocked pikachu face.
banks doesnt have regrets  she regretted thatshe didn t make money. she s gaslighting and there s receipts thatshe threw men under the bus.
I love how you bridge the gap  helping these narcissistic women find redemption. elizabeth may be simply attempting damage control waiting for her next chance to once again be paid to complain while ruining another franchise.
my fav moment - elizabeth banks at the women in film awards ceremony   I went to indiana jones and jaws and every movie steven spielberg ever made  and by the way  he s never made a movie with a female lead. sorry  steven. I dont mean to call your ass out  but its true. audience member   the color purple silence  then  oh...Im wrong.
remember when popcorn movies were just a pleasant escape from reality  yeah... good times.
she attacked the fans  her leads attacked the fans also  we all knew it was going to be a stay away movie before it came out
that one meme sums it up perfectly elizabeth banks  this movie ain t meant for you  men!!! movie bombs at the box officeelizabeth banks  why aren t men watching my movie !
I noticed most of the movies on that list were by kathryn bigelow  who has directed everything from war movies to action movie to even horror movies. I just watched one of hers the other night called near dark. didn t even know she made it until after I finished it and read up on it more. she never seems to make a stink about her being female. in fact  she kinda shattered elizabeth banks  narrative on that in 1990 with this quote   if there s specific resistance to women making movies  I just choose to ignore that as an obstacle for two reasons  I cant change my gender  and I refuse to stop making movies. its irrelevant who or what directed a movie  the important thing is that you either respond to it or you dont. there should be more women directing  I think there s just not the awareness that its really possible. it is.
banks   men  this movie isn t for you. men  dont watch the moviebanks   why did my movie tank at the box office!  men
remember the scene in brightburn when elizabeth bank s character was dropped from 35k feet   plummeted to her doom   kinda describes her directing career thus far.
you have been putting out so many videos lately its been great. thank you for taking the time to make such great videos.
the charlie s angels movies that came out 20 years were fairly well received. there s no excuse for why her version couldn t replicate thatsuccess.
never understood the theory of  cant watch a movie if you cant see yourself in it  like it just proves how neutered society is now like you cant imagine yourself in a movie situation unless you see someone who looks like you do it first  like come on they are really trying to make some mindless consumers and no one wants to face it
who would have thought that hating on people is going to make them not want to watch things that you are in...alita  battle angel is still one of my favorite movies that has come out in the last 10 years. that movie is so good. you also have jolt which I enjoyed a lot.the 2000 s charle s angels was goofy and made no sense but it was a good movie. they made the women sexy as hell but also badass and smart. it was just a comedy action movie that didn t take itself seriously.
near dark from kathryn bigelow is an absolute classic unlike most of the throwaway trash made today  -
she also said in the post  I was able to direct an action movie  frankly  because itstarred women and Im a female director  so she said she got to direct that movie because she was a female director isn t that her being privileged  the entire movie was marketed as  white male this movie is not for you  and she somehow seem surprised that white males aren t supporting it. if she truly think there was a problem with the movie s pr she could have stated it long before it became this serious. this is just her trying to back pedal after it blew up in her face.
can you give me a short list of her hits  Ive probably seen em  but it d be cool to compare her work to men s work and see if there is any discernible difference. Im betting there isn t and we only know it was a hwymn director because of the credits
dude  elizabeth banks is just not happy because she made a movie that was trash this remake of charlie s angel the third one was a lesbian s dream  she literally wanted to turn all the charlie s angels into lesbians and kristen stewart look like a stud  and now she wants to write revisionist history  with the past female directors who all directed action movies  just because hollywood s not hiring her as an actress no more now she thinks thatshe can direct  pitch perfect was all right but it wasn t the design to bash man every 5 minutes and turn every female into a lesbian s dream
@bw estacado  she appeared four times in that list
@bw estacado  imdb is your friend
the director of point break will always have my respect
@sam  not to mention  strange days  - absolutely amazing movie  with an equally amazing angela bassett kicking some serious ass...
@jimbo bimbo  yeah I also really liked strange days  -
their comeback to that will be  she was married to james cameron and had it easy. lol always a excuse  diversion or lack of accountability.
librarian  like  you wouldn t jump at the opportunity of a dummy thicc librarian  with the cute glasses and poofy and shit
@themountainman2002  yeah  Im sure someone is into that.
@themountainman2002  yeah nerd girls are a definite turn on.  they didn t even aim for that.
how many dudes actually ever really gazed at her
there isn t anything on kristen to gaze anyway.
she actually flashes her legs a fair bit in this  in short dresses and shorts  but kristen s amazing legs are not enough to carry the movie. it was also not bad story wise  but I agree 100  that it was utterly ruined by the over the top man hating  gender swapping and misandry on display... it was just too much. 2 10
what kills me is how she s like  was hoping to defeat the male gaze  oh you mean the same gaze that populated the entire planet  the same gaze responsible for creating civilization   like why are we always shamed for simply being what nature made us but anything involving women we shouldn t shame though.
@madquest8  any movie that villainizes the characters of the original isnt very good  mission impossible while a good movie is not a good mission impossible  lets take the main character and make him a bad guy has never been good storytelling ever
you are spot on.  and  powerful women in hollywood can be seen since the beginning.  women like ginger rogers had their own production companies and carved their spots without whining all the time....thats real girl power!
near dark  point break  the hurt locker and zero dark thirty. four great movies across four decades. but elizabeth banks probably sees herself as some kind of trailblazer.
@n7 tigger  I watched the hurt locker. didn t kathryn bigelow get an oscar nomination for it as director
@may loo  yes
that doesnt count! it breaks the narrative!
@bw estacado  point break and the hurt locker for starters.
michelle maclaren has directed several episodes of breaking bad  better call saul  and game of thrones. in particular  she directed from breaking bad the episodes  one minute    salud   and  to hajiilee  which are among some of the most action packed episodes of the series.
beat me to it.
@annienakki  lucille ball was the first woman to run a major television studio and produced such important shows such as the untouchables  which was made into a major film with sean connery in the 1980 s   mission  impossible  which is a major movie franchise now   and a little independent tv show that you might have heard of called star trek!
@bw estacado it literally half of this list. strange days  the hurt locker  blue steel  point break.
strange days is easily in the top 20 sci-fI films. talking about the 90 s in the 90 s.
I generally like her movies.
she s an brilliant director  been a fan of hers since near dark
been watching her since near dark. funny thing is  nobody gives a single fuck what the gender of the creator is. we will never even see them throughout the movie  save for those who do little cameos. what we care about is what we re seeing. men dont get a pass  they get railed hard for their films if they turn out bad.
@may loo  not just nominated... she won it. beating her ex-husband james cameron the year he released avatar.
who  never heard of her.
yeah she wasn t a woman director she was a director who just happened to be a woman and a great one
thank you..
@annienakki  and lucille ball she ran a production company  managed to get a show on the air featuring a interracial couple  was the first to think of re-running the show in syndication something every one else told her was stupid  she even pushed for star trek  to name a few. the difference between women in hollywood like ginger rogers and lucy were despite being at a disadvantage in hollywood  they didn t sit there and just bitch about it. they went out there and pushed.
@dct  so true!  ida lupino directed  lee grant directed....I hate whiners.  it is such a cop out to say the things e. banks  viola davis  et al keep saying....it has really set feminism back  I think.
no actual strong independent capable woman needs to make an issue of it.
matrix movies. directed by a pair of women. film made for men. strong independent woman as co star. but the young woksters will continue to believe that no women have ever made successful movies because men.
ironically her association with james cameron kind of puts the kibosh on bigelow s accomplishments.her accomplishments are many and varied but the greater opinion of hollywood about her seems to be thatshe slept her way to the top through riding cameron s success upwards.its a shame because almost certainly working with great directors is the fiery forge that turns many in hollywood from various professions into directors themselves.case in point clint eastwood  frank marshall  david twohy  david koepp - even elizabeth banks herself.the problem is that these people who love to complain either missed their chance to work with great directors  chose bad director mentors to work with  or didn t work with any and simply played off their position in hollywood to get a directing job.
@luke whitaker  exactly.its sad that this is likely the common perspective because at best it gained her access to some of the cast of aliens while she was putting together near dark.that leaves out 2 of the antagonists and basically all of the protagonists in the film who all played great parts for what the film was in its genre.
@mountain nomad vfx  I heard that clint eastwood slept with stanley kubrik to jump start his directing career.....not sure where I heard that....probably in my head.
I actually liked the hurt locker and the peacemaker. even zero dark thirty was decent.
@lupo10  and then they transitioned  went full woke  and made the recent trash movies where the villain is a machine is misogynistic.
@annienakki  lucille ball was litreally one the three most powerful people in hollywood back in her day.. she and her husband desI arnez rana production studio and she had a ton of hits come out of it back in the day  excellent actress  excellent producer and major tv and movie mogul
@eric heide  and I never heard her whine once about being a victim!  if youre into old movies you can catch her as one of the runway models in fred and ginger s movie roberta....she came a long way  baby...
@jimbo bimbo  strange days is one of my favourites.
@the sage 85  I dont think revisionist means what you think it means.
hmm good point
didn t she do that movie detroit
you forgot about bryce dallas howard  jodie foster  sophia coppola  etc.  but I digress.
bro she s giving excuses..... why would she choose a point that will go against them
yeah she can do pretty much anything she wants 25 years ago she was one of the first considered to direct x men. near dark is great too
kathryn bigelow is absolute chad
@lupo10   matrix movies. directed by a pair of women. film made for men. strong independent woman as co star. but the young woksters will continue to believe that no women have ever made successful movies because men. that will be why they were called the wachowskI brothers at the time the original trilogy was released...
@si_ w  I assumed someone who finally get the joke
and bigelow has made some kick ass movies
@lupo10  if im not mistaken  those were directes by brothers that are now trans women
@klara petrijev anin  haha yeah  I was being ironical. or maybe not  never know what s ironic after growing up in the 90 s.
@lupo10  hahaha good one
tried to ride the wave of the metoo movement
this isn t the reason  men in general are tired of being looked at as the bad guys by feminism. why support something that portrays you as a villian 24 7.
they were in the tv show too. that was why the show appealed to girls  because the angels were smart.
@palladiamors  him  honey  what s the chemical make up of an apple again her  again  well  there s quercetin-3-galactoside  quercetin-3-glucoside  quercetin-3-rhamnoside-him   drools quietly to himself  ooooooh fuck yeah baby  give me the facts...
they do nothing short of shoving a camera up her... in the opening sequence. honestly  stewart has nothing to fear in regards of men wanting to look at her. also  the expression itself is basically proof they  strongly dislike  everything about straight men. God forbid we enjoy something about a woman.
yeah... go and twerk  wear tight jeans  etc... and then complain when people look... so dumb...
@hadwell  its like even they dont know what they want  how are we supposed to know
@scribd fukkyu  I think they want people to look so they can cry foul  and tell men how bad they are... unless its someone they also find attractive...
@hadwell ah yes  the schrodingers paradox do be strong in them
this movie isn t made for you! dont watch it! this is for all the females!men  alright  works for usdoesnt watch the moviehollywood  why didn t men watch and support the movie
I think women s problem is that they believe men and women think the same way. think about it  you tell women that they shouldn t do something  what are they going to do  they will do it  even if its just out of spite. its the same principle as with children. the more you forbid them to do something  the more they want to do that. an yes  I just compared the average woman s mentality to that of a child. men dont operate like that though. we dont operate on emotion but on logic and reason. or to sum it up  we just do what we f cking want to do. if its a garbage movie  we wont watch it  regardless of what they tell us to do. same goes for when its an awesome movie.
not all clowns wear makeup.
@pandaman  you nailed it!
@pandaman  I think thats a broad generalization thats easily disproven  very easily
@zergs4uc3  how are you planning to disprove this  you shouldn t let emotions get the better of you and think carefully about making these kind of claims. besides plentely of video evidence on youtube and articles on the internet  your lip service about your experiences isn t evidential even if you think it is. platitudes are not equal to  proof . Im well prepared for this kind od debate. Ive had them with plentely of overconfident  people like you before. and they always end the same way. you will whine about misogyny and start calling me names.
@pandaman  any woman in science or math thinks with logic and any man in the arts thinks with emotion  thinking is more to deal with personality type then it does gender  but you are fairly close minded to the thought that anything could be contrary to your way of thinking. citing youtube and the internet for your claims is pretty telling of what kind of person you are  good day.
@zergs4uc3  well  just platitudes as I expected. and the shaming is also starting as I foretold. women in math aren t necessairily making logical decisions. math is about applying formula in their field of work  not about rational and logical decision making  which this is about as you seem to have forgotten . a men of arts beign all about emotions also isn t true. see  thats a very broad generalization. you should refrain from using words if you dont know thier meaning. all you provided was lip service as expected even though I told you that this is not evidential. youreally didn t think this through even though I told you to do so before you end up ridiculing yourself. I was right on all my predictions. you started the shaming immediately and spouded nothing but platitudes and half-truth at best. you should read a dictionary about what evidence means and what logic and reason is. you disproved nothing. you didn t even manage to prove anything. you even went ahead and picked the worst professions to support your narrative because women in science and math are hopefully underrepresented. ad again  applying knowledge in your field of expertise has nothing to do with being logical. or did you ever have to make a logical or rational decision when you had to apply a formula in math class  or did you make an emotional decision before deciding what to draw in art class  very badly chosen examples. but try again as many times as you want. Im very patient with snowflakes.
@zergs4uc3  so tell me why 85  of women support lgbtq and immigrants and also sjw warrior  while most men doesnt give f about that!
@pandaman  also math and science is not good way to determine people s emotion. they are what they are! dont care about your personal believs.
@zergs4uc3  parts of it can be proven wrong thats how generalization are but its a fact that women think more emotionally than logically.
@pandaman  I agree with some of your points but you kinda sound like some of the females youre describing right now. his emotions didn t get the best of him just because he said something you didn t agree with and thats the logical standpoint of the situation
@zergs4uc3  its about the same but it always depends on the person both gender and personality but statically women are in fact far more emotional. the emotional thinking is majority female and vice versa for logic by that mentality gender would be a key factory over personality. so far thats more evidence leading to gender instead of personality
@pandaman  generally jobs like that indeed take more logic women usually take less logical jobs like caretaker housekeeping attendant or whatever but I see where youre coming from for instance teaching is usually held by women but they re given a play by play of what they need to teach or it used to be like that unfortunately a lot of them men include are teaching gay s3x to children  they re groomers that deserve life in prison at the least  you could apply the same though to science unless youre experimenting yourself they get a play by play of what needs to be accomplished. regardless what Ive been saying the in the comments is the truth most women are emotional most men are logical doesnt apply to all and its effected by both gender and personality with gender being the leading factor based on statistics.
@gaal  what he said wasnt personal beliefs its a fact. y all sound more like incels than anything else not very logical at all
@pandaman    men dont operate like that though. we dont operate on emotion but on logic and reason. okay  you ve lost me here. Ive seen plenty of men act on emotion more so then logic and reason. just the gaming space alone where its still pretty male heavy  Ive seen plenty of fanboys act more on emotion then logic. its not really much of a men or women thing  its just there will always be people who will act on emotion regardless what gender they are.
@dinoslay  oh man  did you just come up with that  genius
right the only thing they got right  was when ks said in the trailers that men take 7 more seconds to decide whether a woman is a threat or not...
thats what made the angel s so badass. they were a lot like the bond girls  where there s usually 2 in each movie  a good girl  and the bad girl. both used their attractiveness   sex to manipulate bond and any other men that got in their way  and it was usually up to bond to figure out who was who quickly. because both were secretly badass martial arts experts who would hide a dagger under the pillow while they were bedding him. the  good girl  was usually an american cia agent who wanted to test if bond was really on the same side  and the  bad girl  would straight up try to kill him. some men in the stories were even aware of their sexual manipulations  but because they were so damn hot the men usually still fell for it anyway  bond included  many times .charlies angel s is awesome because we get 3 of the  good  girls  and usually an even more badass  bad girl boss  who is tougher than the men they have to fight  because they cant use their same manipulation tactics on her. their sexuality was always an important weapon that complimented each character.
@the large hardon collider  exactly
@the large hardon collider  1 and 2 were like you were watching from a window and the 3rd you were being dragged by the car they were in
so accurate..impeccable logic.
yes nobody is interested in tax accountants in action movies.
funny that you say that   there s a romance movie like that coming out soon...
good comparison and it makes a lot of sense.
imagine making a  romcom   with two gay men  having it fail  then blaming straight men for that failure. oh wait... that already happened.
@buck rodgers  lmao what     thats ridiculous! what movie is this
@fari67  bros
@fari67  yeah it was  bros . they started calling straight men  homophobic  simply because their  core demographic  was a fraction of a fraction of people. and the movie only saw about 4 mill in ticket sales.
making a romance movie and telling women not to go see it they made it. its called  bros .
@yagurumasou  yup  it was a  train-wreck  from the start.
but doesnt that already happen every time someone label s a movie a  chick flick  or  date movie  ....sometime s before even seeing it  its just kind of assumed no guy will actually watch it unless his girlfriend wife drag s him to go  even manly man hugh jackman  the wolverine himself  made a broadway musical chick flick film........I am pretty sure he didn t expect the same x-men crowd to go watch it.
truth
and men still went but not women
yup. as a guy  if you dont want me to watch your movie or tv show  I definitely wont watch it. you dont have to tell me that no means no.
men  aight.  watches kathryn bigelow movie instead
in defense of elizabeth banks  whatever comes out her mouth is a result of the studio s marketing department. since they are writing her paychecks she needs to tow the lines
charlie s angels was long a hottie t a tv show with pin up stars. it was rebooted into fluffy a t a comedy with a listers. this lady desperate to make yet another reboot with feminists and feminist messaging as a vehicle to continue to push her own stardom hired actresses that looked like rejects from heroin recovery centers. guess who watches feminist fantasy genre of women trying to be feeman. same audience that watches wnba no one. you want men to watch get a man to star  get make writers  and a make director and make a show for men. men dont want feminist garbage. time to load up some john wick.
major frosk comparison here. frosk   if you dont like it  dont watch it.  men   okey doke.  frosk   wait.
@galadrius the mighty  ironically after suporting frosk they had amouranth in a bikinI soooo hipocrites
@fjparasite  pretty much  yeah. even then  ratings were still down.
@al grundau  not really. Imean take for example the movie  as good as it gets . that is classified as a  chick flick   and I remember going to see that movie in theaters back in the day of my own volition anyway. why  because hollywood wasn t into making garbage back then. a label dont make the movie  the movie can speak for itself. weather it be good or bad  thats when the failures or successes present themselves.
@al grundau
@r bu  what !
@saltedroastedcaramel  60  of charlie s angels audience was men. more women went to go see rambo  last blood.
@thatharvguy  yeah no women didn t watch that movie and was manly man wonk fest.
I remember being grateful that there were so many warning flags on this one. it made certain that I knew I shouldn t go watch. count your blessings gents.
I need to now physically see this in meme form  please  Im begging you!! this is so good!!!
@r bu  so in your view. women playing basketball  or any sport  is feminist garbage  ....and I quote.... feminist fantasy genre of women trying to be feeman. same audience that watches wnba ....would you prefer women not play sports at all  or you just resent that camera s actually film it  please elaborate.
@al grundau  hes saying most men dont watch female sports when a male basketball game or male soccer game is played it will fill the stadium when womens basketball and women soccer play a small amount of people show up or watch online because when men play theres tension and you feel part of the team when women play it feels drawn out to many misses and always low scoring thats why mens sports are a multImillion dollar industry and women dont bring anything additional they need compensation with exception of female tennis as far as im aware they actually fill up the stadium
@vergil lives  I watched women s u18 soccer  canada vs u.s.a  live!...55 000 attendance edmonton  alberta.u.s won on a late goal.plenty of drama  no  misses
@saltedroastedcaramel  yeah  my husband and I have talked about this and he will joke that  hey  they made this for you now  so this is yours  and I ll just be like  nah  I dont watch that kind of stuff  its not for me. lol.
like  I grew up super tomboyish  but Im so cliche now when it comes to girl stuff. Im always telling people   no  I am like other girls.  instead of the other way around. not that we re a hive mind. I just like a lot of the stereotypical stuff.
elizabeth banks is at the mercy of the marketing department and she has to tow the line as they are writing her paychecks.
she s running out of that hunger games money and the bank account is getting really low
elizabeth banks is just one of many actors that has sellers remorse for whatever they had to do to get the  career . they punch down because they are cowards.
Im a woman. I dont need every movie or show I watch to have female leads. I just need stories and characters I enjoy. Im picky  so a lot of stuff  they re making for me  dont interest me  like star-wars and some marvel stuff and lotrs .
not only was she wrong  but the bigger issue is thatshe doesnt understand thatspielberg is under no obligation to make female lead movies. its his movie. he can make whatever he wants.
@joseph brown  agreed.
@ghostofasiren  in addition to this  a person cannot make a decent story that they cannot relate with. for example  george lucas  films all had the same formula because thats how he rolled. ann rice had all of her novels with basically the same storyline. you cant go up to someone  male or female and say  make a good story with this type of person . it just doesnt work that way. what Im trying to say is that you cant make a story teller have a quota for representation and have good quality.
top gun maverick reminded me of that... I left the theatre feeling so good after.... but other than that...yeah...good times.
Imember...
wait... they were once meant to be a pleasant escape from reality
stupidly did a pineda - I wouldv e thought that was a recent object lesson to not do that  pineda played faye in recent live action cowboy bebop where she attacked old fans and another film new fans... and guess what   no second series for some reason...lol
what list
near dark is awesome
and she worked in collaboration with james cameron on the original point break which was great
she actually did  she did some interview couple of years ago claiming she didn t get oscar because  audience doesnt like female directors   which is kinda bizarre statement because previous years her movie won oscar   the hurt locker  I think . this was  dunno  2010-2011 maybe. I remember pointing out this on facebook page that posted her interview and they instantly blocked me for  hate speech .
@temp sitch  the list in the video...
I kept thinking the tables would turn on brandon.nope.
@no one of consequence  it was a blessing in hindsight.
oh yeah  I remember that.
thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom   he s right  I think yt promotes regularity  like fibers .however content creators can be sucked into it... and end up  burnt out . so be careful  higher the rise   sharper the fall
the angels  the original and the 2000s version  knew their femininity was an asset in their arsenal of abilities.the reboot didn t get the memo.
@will b. back  charlie s angels with lucy drew and cameron was actually funny and well made.  it was able to poke fun at itself and be entertaining.  add tim curry and sam rockwell and youre gonna have a good movie.  as a 57 year old heterosexual man I ll watch any movie that looks like it ll be good  male lead or female lead.  but agendas and criterias as of late ..... Im very discerning with any movie I ll spend my money on to watch.  I saw  black adam  this weekend on the strength of my brother saying he liked it  and I actually did  too.  yeah  the rock is still playing the rock but overall a good movie  no overt or covert gay themes at all  which is interjected in most movies lately .  but I digress  I like elizabeth banks as an actress and she s always been easy on the eyes  but her bellyaching and wining ..... no surprise.
I love alita too
omg alita was so damn good! no needless  girl power  or whatever  just a damn good character with a damn good story and awesome action scenes. to this day I wish it got a sequel
still waiting for the sequel.....sighs
alita battle angel very good film yes and thats when fox was fox you know before the disney bs got involved you noticed we have not going to part two to this damn movie we still haven t gotten the gambit movie the girl she left she went to go do something else the guy who is gambit went to go do something else I hope he comes back but elizabeth should have known better as soon as people didn t see drew cameron and lucy liu who s in shazam 2 right now this movie bombed the charlie s angels remake
I really liked alita too  and they never spent much time promoting it either. it didn t fit in their box of things ideals that  they wanted to push
yes  lucy lu  drew barrymore  and cameron diaz  I think thats how to spell their names  I loved both of those  am guy  both of those movies are classics for me
point break is one of my favorite movies.  and her complaining about the marketing and not taking responsibility for an awful movie is so hollywood  first they said the movie wasn t for men and then they complained when men didn t go see it. men cant win with them lol.  youre so lucky you got your isom cover b  I cant wait to get mine!
this is an all too common problem with modern movies and tv shows  by harping on about the main character s immutable characteristics. I dont give a damn about a character s gender  ethnicity or skin tone as long as its a good story that doesnt seek to insult my intelligence or talk down to me in a condescending way.
as midnight s edge pointed out at the time more women went to see rambo last blood than this charlie s angels movie
you know Im a customer!  aren t you supposed to give me what I want and kiss my a    me after being lectured and insulted by hollywood marketing campaigns
all Im hearing is truths so far. and as a man  I have nothing against female directors. its the constant male bashing I dont like  and male directors oddly enough can do that too. the origianl charlie s angels tv show was like by both men and woman. why would you want to change something like that. you are so right melonie. word of mouth goes a long way. and if people you know and trust say its bad  odd s are you may not go and see just on that alone. yay!!! isom  1  rippaverse. great video melonie. say hey to your folks
dont wanna sound cliche or cringe but you are one amazing woman who s not afraid to tell how it is  no matter the amount of horse shit you may take.
most people dont want to adapt entertainment to the real world  is one of the truest statements Ive heard in a long time. thats why I and many with me prefer works of fantasy or sci-fI fiction  because it gives us something we cant experience in the real world. Ive only read a handfull of books releases this side of 2010  and mostly fantasy targeted towards pre-teens  as some nostalgic series from my youth got sequels  so I dont quite know how all of this  reflect the real world  crap is portrayed in modern literature  but every time I pick up a crime novel instead of a fantasy novel I get instantly both uncomfortable and bored. if I want to read about someone being kidnapped or murdered I ll open a newspaper  there is always something of the sort happening  and if I want to read about characters complaining about rent and gas and food prices and immigrants  which all seems to be common traits for characters to do when they are not solving crime  I ll head down to the local pizza place or closest mall. I dont see the appeal of these stories that are so close to our own reality.
what I find funny is how she tries to deny it wasn t her fault  yet the proof is on the internet.
telling men not to watch movies because its not far you is a such a dumb idea when thats probably more than half of their potential audience.
blame men all you want elizabeth banks  blame men all you want  its not gonna make a damn difference
and yet a week before the movie was supposed to come out  she worked her crank holster and told people not to go so the terms were acceptable
I like how she and the latest terminator dictators act like they re going to apologize for their actions but really dont.
thank God for women like you
I was told it wasn t made for me  so I didn t go see it.  I swear  I think all of hollywood lives in some kind of weird echo chamber.
wonder woman also had a very strong male supporting actor who wasn t watered down for views. though arguably its hard to water down chris pine  he s just a man s man which is why I think he was a terrific choice for james tiberius kirk.
thank you for being brave enough to be yourself. you rock just how you are.
Ive never seen a female action character written by a woman who was truly badass. you cant write a strong lead when you aren t strong yourself. they just come out sounding like victims.
Imiss the days when movies were there to inspire us  to make us dream  to give us goosebumps and sometimes to give us the opportunity to just escape from reality  which sucks it is  just for a moment..
Im so glad I was raised in the 90s watching all the best movies . it was a great time for movies before all this race  gender and many other political views were injected in movies today.
old school charlie s angels also didn t always rely a ton on action either. there was action  but the women used their brains a lot more than they did their brawn. Ive noticed that a lot of those shows that many would consider to be action packed with lots of fighting and biffs and bams and pows  a lot of times they aren t completely like that.
point break is so good  fast and furious ripped it off
she directed the amazing near dark! one of best vampire movies ever. disgusting how these whiners cry like nancy kerrigan when their crappy ideas fail. why would I pay good money to sit in the cinema to be insulted   happy halloween!
I watched it and I think the fight scene is not good. I didn t care about their political view actually. I just think the fight scene is not fun. I dont know why the original film fight scene is too cartoonish but it got me excited. in this its like the kick is not heavy enough or something like that.
same here--all the man bashing is what keeps me from supporting hollyweird along with the rampant destruction of established canon.
@daniel sweet  thanx for the recommendation
what specific  male bashing  did you observe in the new charlie s angel s re-boot ...please share.
@Christopher pineau  what specific  man bashing  in movies are youreferring to  which movies  actresses and line s are youreferring to exactly  please share specific s. so far we have 1 actress telling men not to come  and some female ghostbuster s thatseemed to ruffle a lot of feather s  yet I did not hear any man bashing in the actual movie....yes I actually watched it twice to make sure . ...so please  by all means  enlighten me. what  man bashing  movies  roles and specific line s are there that have you so upset
@Christopher pineau  o. the latter part of thatsounds like she hulk in a nutshell
are there people who criticise her  Ive found her by coincidence when she was a co-star in one of drinker s videos. and she seemed very down to earth  sweet and realistic. from what she said in that video  she only ever gets toxic backlash from feminist women.
@pandaman  not sure but than again  I only found her channel recently t_t so I wouldn t know.
btw law order  criminal minds   ncis and such as also great series.. same goes for dexter
the proof is in the movie  too.
and the toilet
she denied that it was her fault. basic grammar dude.
especially for family films. tell a dad the film isn t for him  and the whole family buys tickets for someone else s film.
@jack dingler  yeah 100  right so really you lose way more than just the men good point
its all always been in movies it was just never so blatant and in yur face...
thanks for being a voice for reason and sanity in this woke era of nonsense.
imagine my shock
amazing how women like you who are honest  get the respect that women like banks want.
I watch wonder woman once or twice a year with my little sister  it is a wonderful movie  pun intended   cannot say the same about the new charlie s angel s movie. I watched the original series even the original movie reboot with my mom. when a movie is just that  a movie  it is focused on entertainment  nothing more.
I really love how she just gets it. thank God she s got a sharp mind tempered by wisdom.
its impossible not to feel the cynicism of this director s words.
I do so greatly appreciate your realism towards everything. we need so many other people to return to reality
she thinks we re stupid  like we forgot that interview blatantly say  this is for women endure it men
my sisters liked the 2000 charlie s angels reboot for all the reasons you stated. I enjoyed it  but my sisters liked it far more than I did. they hated banks  reboot though.
this  to me  is like someone coming to my house and saying   ha  you are forbidden from going to brazil! go ahead and grovel! and me shutting the door like   never wanted to go to brazil  so thats fine.
I love how kathryn bigelow directed 4 of the 10 movies listed. absolute boss!
remember when she tried to diss steven spielberg at an awards show  saying he never directed women in a lead  then women of color  and the audience immediately shouted out   the color purple  even on her own turf she fails at clout chasing.
I had no idea there was a charlie s angel reboot lol. the last one I remember was in the early 2000s with drew barrymore and tom green. that one was actually funny and entertaining
my favorite bit of this is melanie calling lizzy banks  honey . banksey would love thatshe says there was a problem with how the movie was marketed  ignoring the fact they she headed that whole thing up. so she has a problem with how she marketed that movie. and in a sense she was successful. billy eichner adopted her approach of pre-emptively shame-cusing the audience. she then went promethean and blamed those same men for blah blah.
good to see you uploading on the daily  mac. I love it when you interact with your fans.
love your video!  banks loves her revisionist history.  what a frustration.  I cant believe that people dont see the flaw in  Im going to make a movie that doesnt appeal to anyone but the narrative and it ll be a great success!   Im hoping that when I get to town and get my mail tomorrow my copy of isom will be waiting for me.  -   this is the most interest Ive had for a comic since the kingdom come graphic novel.
as a straight guy  Im all for an action comedy flick with hot girls kicking ass.  combines everything Im looking for in a movie into one.  really difficult to mess that up  honestly  but she managed to pull it off.  get one or several fit women  put them in some tight revealing clothes  give them some generic dudes to beat up  and write a joke or two for them to say while they do it.  its a recipe for a guaranteed blockbuster.  charlie s angels even had the plot handed to them and got extra points for nostalgia.  if you were to make them vampires  give them katanas  and say the bad guys are nazis  you d have the best movie of all time  with only its sequels to round out the top 3.  if she had just said nothing  she d have a lot more money right now.  being a crazy leftist is expensive.
yes another melonie video!  have fun with your family
I have to point out that paul feig did essentially the same thing with ghostbusters 2016 and he s shamed worse than she is. if anything  the public has had the kitty gloves on for her since we still bag on feig for starting this crap.
when you tell a big part of the general audience that the movie or show wasn t made from them dont expect them to watch lol
amen to that!
I think women like banks would call melanie here a  pick me girl   and write off her opinions as  just trying to get a man s attention or approval
it didn t help that it wasn t a good movie
@the maker  the female ghostbusters movie was worse though lol
you couldn t have said it better. its entertainment  not an epiphany to finally wake up and see the light. I am more prone to check a movie out and have no idea if its it good  because of the hot actresses. shallow  no thats not what Imust have in a woman in order to fall in love.
my favorite part in charlies angles 2000 was sam rockwell  made such a great villain.
melonie is so funny.  I loved her opening with the mind blown   .  point break is one of my favorite action movies of all time love that movie  the original .  I knew a chic directed it and didn t care she made an awesome fun film that I still really enjoy.  enjoyed the hurt locker as well very engaging.  I wish my wife would wear a lara craft outfit for halloween.  usually it is some kind of eskimo wear or too conservative.  most of the costumes for ladies are usually over the top sexy.  thats why costume parties are so great.
I actually google image  lara croft cosplay   all the women were dresses in tomb raider classic   underworld and black catsuit outfits. I saw maybe one in the reboot outfit and it was at the bottom of the search.
one of the things that I really like about you is that youre able to see that men like to look at pretty women. surprise surprise. lol. but a lot of women put men down for that. you dont do that and even admit that you and other women also like to look at attractive women. Im not saying that you look at them in the same way as men  but you do look and admire admire that they re attractive. I love your personality and your hair is awesome. you come off as being that tomboy girl next door type that would be really easy to get along with. I also cant tell you how much I love the fact that you are a Christian. I love that you do the verse of the day and praying on your channel. God bless you and your family. duane.
new subscriber here I just wanted to say this was an awesome video I love your energy and I love your honesty.
you gained a new subscriber. thank you for the real content you make.
I remember liking her as betty brant in sam raimI s spider-man trilogy.....she was funny  witty and played one of the few characters who could push jameson s buttons without any repercussions......now  you couldn t pay me enough to watch a movie directed by  produced by and or starring elizabeth banks! no gaze from me!
props for supporting the rippaverse.  I really do like when random youtubers support other random youtubers  just because its the right thing to do.  much respect!
cant get enough of you! great content
I really liked old guard  and of course the first wonder woman. they were fun movies  no politics  well that I could detect. there are  gritty  more grounded movies that are great  but all the good ones carry you to another world  and turn off the stress of the day. let you hit the bed that night thinking of the awesome world creation rather than whatever you need to accomplish at work in the  morning
I got covid last week then as I was starting to feel better got hit by a bacterial thing thatset me back. so Ive been watching a lot of movies in the past week. mostly  Ive been watching stuff made no more recently than about 2008  and the closer to the present you get the more the focus is off entertainment and on to nonsense instead. a great exception has proven to be low budget movies  where storytellers are just telling their stories. I need a good story and interesting characters  I dont need agendas and checkboxes.
she was telling men herself  dont watch it
I didn t know the hurt locker had a female director. bravo lady  I loved that flick
just because something has a targeted demograph doesnt mean those outside of the demograph are excluded  until hollywood understands this with fandoms this cycle will only repeat.
fellow isom supporter here  Im loving everything this book has. I hope eric july continues kicking ass.
right on with the constant new content! keep building up the new channel.
what I dont get is if they already see it happening  they should already stop giving us this garbage  but I guess they wanna go until they become broke. but I guess we will just have to give it time  and then they should start turning it around.
when they try and gaslight you for being a man because you didn t enjoy their movie. who s your target demographic  cause they  aren t showing up
what she says is so true! with any of these victim attitudes  the ball bounce back and hit them in the face. so easy to make fun of it. no self-awareness. at all.
men neither lol. didn t even occur to me to look who directed it  like most movies. I liked it based on its content and that was a good movie
kathryn bigelow has done good  successful movies in the past.  proving it can be done.  no man-bashing needed.
I loved charlie s angels original series the tv remake and the 2000s films because it was fun and good no agendas just good storytelling
people watch movies to escape from the real world and have fun. they dont want their entertainment to also be  realistic  and boring . love the video  keep it up fam!
the original charlie s angles was ground breaking. it was wickedly popular.
56 you may already say this  but I was one who was open to a new  charles angels  having seen the last one. this one not only had bad pr it was 100  used to bash men in order the elevate the main characters. also  there s the thing where none of the three angels set each other apart. they all were too perfect and none contributed anything different from one another.
Im fascinated why as a company you would instantly want to alienate and annoy half of your potential customers and depending on the ip maybe 70-80. fascinating. has to be money laundering at this point with the costs of some of this rubbish is to make.
hey there  Im a 60  yr old man. some of movies I have really enjoyed are about women directed by women. the holiday  1 of my favorite   old guard  point break. wonder woman. I watched charlie s angels    liked it  also like ms banks .  after the fact I saw an interview where she said men should go watch it because her whole life she has been  forced  to  watch movies by men  about men. kinda took the fun out of it  have to admit. to date I have never decided to watch  or not watch a movie because of the gender of the director. Imust say I have faced to watch a movie because the director was someone who directed movies I have enjoyed in the past  ron howard  rob   carl reiner . most of the time it didn t come into play  who directed it.
loving your videos. keep going boom melonie!
girlfriend  you rock. never change  no matter what  always stay yourself  cause you rock. the mindset you have only comes with age  and your so young  so never change.
lmao  I love your outlook on reality. they keep throwing us these hoops.
angelina jolie directed the ww2 unbroken film and it went without any controversies and did good in theaters
when banks does the retrospective deal we just see the hate trail is longer than we initially remembered
there was a disconnect on the marketing side of it for me no there was a disconnect on the reality side of it for me! there lizzie  fixed it for you!
subbed. your level of self awareness made my day.
tom cruise  rock and henry cavill this year     our latest films are made for the fans and their enjoyment.   we thank the fans that have actually made the effort to get to the cinemas and buy a ticket - we really appreciate it - and hope you like it.  thanks again .   thats kinda how it was always done before we got so clever.
I got the same cover isom. I cant wait for number 2. I am glad to see young people like yourself not indoctrinated. we may have a future yet.
you say they ll learn when they re not making money  but they never seem to learn their lesson. no matter how much money they dont make.
zero dark thirty made by the same director as the hurt locker
your commentary always nails it! keep it up!
I really like you. what you say has this great  mild ironic flair to it and makes so much sense that hollywood just lost. another reason  surprise  surprise youre very good looking and attractive. thank you and boom!
elizabeth banks   this movie ain t for you men! men   ok.  challenge accepted!

just found your channel  love the content. your so on point
she said it herself in interviews!
I love this woman.
she had even said she didn t make the movie for men a couple weeks before it was released.  she must have been hoping everyone forgot.
as a dude who watched charlies angels as a kid  I thought the new one was a fun time.
like she would ever have a chance to direct a mission impossible movie
glad she explained math to writers
its like   oh  let me pick something to be pretend  angry about even it ruins me because negativity sells .

recently discovered your channel  you seem like a really cool person with interesting takes  you ve earned a subscriber.
I stumbled upon this video and thought I d give it a view. I followed the story through most of it and thought  this is ok but..... then I saw the last part of it....you have one more subscriber.
here s the thing about all of this regardless of what was said to consumers or whatever controversy  if the movie were good  people would have liked it. nobody cares who the director is if the movie doesnt suck. literally hire some good comedy writers and someone from the jackie chan stunt team to choreograph and edit the fight scenes and hire some actors that aren t useless at action scenes. just do better
melonie is so Goddam cute  tiny ball of sass and I love it.
wonder woman was brilliant  also the hurt locker  that a woman directed was amazing
have you seen hollywood s september box-office  lowest in 25 years. lower even than 9 11 despite over 40 films being released
oh and melonie  I believe it was men who predominantly bought tickets to that terrible charlie s angels remake. if Im remembering correctly  it was the hwymn who didn t show up lmao
your video popped up into my feed.  watched for a bit  liked your video  subscribed.  as a man  the second I get a hint of any hate on me for being a man  I automatically lose all interest in watching whatever it is.  lol
I just discovered this channel and it is on point.
hello melonie I always enjoy seeing your videos with your thoughts opions.I hope your having a wonderful relaxing weekend wherever you are takecare melonie
it occurs to me that ms. banks in charlie s angels could well have made a mission  impossible type of movie.
power to you I guess
no alita
@bobo boy  there are too many great female characters for me to list.  I tried to narrow it down to the most popular ones that I believe most people would agree to.  feel free to add!
I love this lol! they re gonna have to actually start focusing on making movies entertaining again at this rate
hey you see this franchise about extremely hot women dressed in sexy outfits making sexual jokes and kicking ass  let s remake that but remove all the sexuality and have them look as androgynous as possible and have them making jokes about men and mysogyny instead genius
an ensemble of women kicking ass that comes to mind is in the movie sucker punch  2011 .  the artwork looks like something straight out of comics.  the soundtrack and choreography is unforgettable.  another memorable one is sin city  2005 .  too bad we cant get movies like that anymore.
love your videos just discovered your channel and its so refreshing to see a female perspective that isn t insane and man hating
nice to see elizabeth banks take interest into the world of the bargain bin movie industry.
Imean when you are writing you need to decide who the target audience is. I am a guy so I dont think like women do. Ive had to watch the movie the notebook like 5 times  but the only part I like is when he refinished the house. but the movie is iconic because it is written for the target audience. besides the refinishing of the house  which allowed me to have a gulp of fresh air  I always just want to throw myself off a balcony headfirst whenever Im subjected to watching that movie.    thanks  tony
this young lady is awesome and dopeshe has character plus strength
when she said that men should return the favour by watching female led movies I was baffled. its not a freaking charity  its my time and if Im going to sit down and watch a movie Im making sure that its a good movie. not my problem that female led all female movies tend to be absolute shite. Im not going to watch your movie to  return the favour   frick off.
why are you so awesome! love your plain ol common sense topics!
I have no idea who directed atomic blonde  but that was an incredible  woman led action movie.  I watched it because itsounded interesting and nobody told me that my race  sex and age weren t welcome to watch or comment on it. I d recommend it to anyone.  I haven t watched this charlies angels  I haven t watched the brie larsen movie  or the female terminator movie.  they told me not to...so I took them at their word.
mel  I love you and all  but some of my friends tried playing a drinking game where we watch your videos and take a shot every time you mention lara croft and now two of them are in the hospital with alcohol poisoning.
its not like charlie s angels was a beloved series for nearly 50 years before the new one
dude charlies angels full throttle was a early crash grab from the old tv show.  Imade fun of my friend watching it back in the day.  it was ok though I ended up watching it while really board
same could be said for ethnicity! hating an entire demographic of people is a quick way to minimize your audience
the hurt locker. this I a very like male demographic type movie. when I saw that film coming up on the list  I waited to hear your take on it.  then you glossed over it.  but the  male oriented film  description is a very point description of it....what you didn t say  or probably didn t know  was that this is one of the most hated films of those with military backgrounds  especially those of us who did serve in iraq.  kb did   what some of these other directors did  create a film to push an agenda without any regard to who would have been the prime target demographic  plus everything in the film is so inaccurate in its military depictions it makes us veterans hold back out vomit .sorry for the rant.  back to your awesome vid.
I grew up watching the original tv charlie s angels. the guys watched it because the girls were hot. the girls watched it because the girls were smart. and everybody watched it because they always got the baddies. the formula isn t any more difficult than that.
david lynch s daughter is an example awesome director. to my knowledge  she doesnt preface everything she does with the message...there s no escape in escapism anymore. so I come to channels like yours to be amused at people telling it like it is. props to you. and what is wrong with being attractive  is that not the idea when a person   man or not  is getting ready to face the world every morning  what is happening  is this whole thing hollywood s over compensation for harvey weinstein    ps props rippaverse and isom!!
most women can never admit when they are wrong. a husband can find his wife doing the nasty in marriage bed with another man. she will claim she can explain  then she will blame hubby for finding out and then claim its hubby fault because he s working all the time because she spends to much of his money.
Im so tired of woke that I didn t even know this even existed... I only heard charlie s angels like twice and I thought they were talking about the old show considering the ion channel was on in the background
... a woman directed the hurt locker and it beat avatar out in awards  so her scapegoating about women dont get to direct action movies with male actors is beyond silly.
God bless you today melonie. hope you are feeling the holy spirit on this day
I remember when they had female badasses in  90s films  sarah connor in  terminator 1   2   ripley in  alien  trilogy .they need to figure out how that worked and repeat the formula.
so glad I stumbled upon this channel
love this channel finally someone with common sense
what an epiphany! did she realize this all on her own
yea just look at xena  warrior princess. she doesnt hate men and she s probably the best thing to even be considered  feminist . if you think about it  xena was never feminist to begin with. she was a flawed character and she could fight. she fought just as many women as she did men.
if its based on fantasy  its entertainment.if its based on fact  its a documentary.if its based on facts that have been  modified  to suit a certain narrative  its the woman king.
what a novel idea. I never would have thought of this.
meloniemacgoboom   elizabeth banks hasn t seen cynthia rothrock or michelle yeoh  moon lee or any other female martial artist back in the early 80s and 90s so many woman held their own on screen and they weren t bashing men they got hurt did their own stunts and did it all over again
Im also going to remind people that men got to movies for women when they are in a relationships with a woman. they also go to action movies with their girlfriends. how ever if they are single they only go to action movies. its kinda easy to figure out what movies are going to make money if you just remember that you just have to make a good action movie.
I watched all the pre-release marketing for the film because I had always liked liz banks as an actress.  she seems to have forgotten thatshe was the marketing.  do olivia wilde.
karen s angels
love the new look mel! look alot better
I didn t know the history behind this one. didn t see it in theaters  but did watch it later on. honestly  I enjoyed it. wasn t as good as previous versions of charlie s angels  but I wouldn t call it a bad film. my main complaint with it would probably be the costumes and some of the cast. the story was fine.
is that a g fuel fridge  thats kind of cool  I want one for my home gym lol.
I love her  she s like an actually cool version of idubbbz  gf or pokimane
these people in hollywood will never say  Im sorry I fucked up I ll do better
she s in complete denial about having a role in her garbage movie failing.
melonie you get it
food for thought  fullmetal alchemist  one of the most beloved manga anime series  was created by a woman. same goes for magI  labyrinth of magic  which just so happens to have one of my favorite female characters.
hImel it is a pleasure to watch your videos tks for your job
and she was a lesbian. nobody complained that I know of. as a young straight male child I loved watching zena. see its possible.
@josh williams  she was bisexual at best  she was with a man before gabrielle  but yes. the show didn t even make her sexuality the forefront of her character either. whereas with all these new shows  sexuality just has to be there  even in disney stuff.
@99thjediwarrior  agreed. yes I now recall the other storylines lol
freeze! put your hands up! I demand to speak to your misogynist manager!
haha yes it is!  d
looks like isom has sold out  with all 3 covers .  I ll have to keep my eyes open. Ive been wanting to snag this and to be able to enjoy my comics again free of the woke agenda
you see this alot. once you no longer get attention for your looks you actually start to think
as usual  blame men for a failure of a movie thats shaming men.her and olivia wild should create the best feminism movie ever starring brie larson and morfydd clark.
on top of realizing that insulting your main demographic is a bad move  they need to realize that the characters they make now appeal to a small minority.in my experience  I have learned that the type of female that appeals to men in games and movies and tv is ironically the same type of female that appeals to other women. like you said melanie  woman opt to dress up as the sexy and badass lara croft of the 90 s to mid 2000 s. why  because thats someone most girls would actually want to be. its the badass yet feminine type they want to be. the butch  masculine and or victimized and oppressed female doesnt appeal to anyone outside of the woke demographic. who wants to be a victim  who wants to be oppressed  thats not a desirable fantasy. just like boys wanted to be as big and badass as arnold and stallone growing up  girls wanted to be as attractive and sexy and empowered as lara croft was.truth is the  male gaze  and  female gaze  overlap quite a bit. you try to eliminate one and you ll also damage the other. neither men nor women are impressed by weak-minded  apologetic  bumbling guys that must always be trumped by their female counterpart. at the same time  neither men nor female see the appeal to a women that is either always oppressed or has completely cast off all her femininity.
equality goes both ways you cant just be praised you have to also accept criticism
I always stick to the past for my entertainment needs lol
man here. I have patiently waited for hollywood to work this out amongst themselves. the first paragraph of this video  would be my response too. unfortunately  I still dont think they have really worked this out. you can also say the same of many other productions hating on their original fanbase  thinking they could possibly get a new and larger fanbase from behaving that way. from doctor who  through comics and hollywood  back up to star wars  the wokeratI and progessives are simply tearing these things apart out of spite. it cannot be profitable  and it certainly makes no sense.
hey  mel  you forgot winkz club  power puff girls  before the feminism     totally spies.edit    what is your opinion on sailor moon
also people thought I was making some feminist manifesto.I just couldn t make the movie I wanted because people with lady bits dont make mission impossible  and this movie had people with lady bits and Im a director with lady bits wow. what a touching story.

there s a little spoken truth in this world. everyone is a victim to some degree. the question is whether you can rise above it or sink beneath it.
too bad that the cast of ghostbusters 2016 never had a revelation like this
a huge number of those  action  movies in that list are not action movies.almost the majority of them even.very telling.
melanie mac just exposed herself for liking birds of prey
as you say  melonie  discriminating against your major target audience  would - if the boot were on the other foot - be declared an outrage. spot on. why should gentle escapism of any kind be so hated in modern society  have we become so embittered   jaded
part of the problem is that many of us remember the drew barrymore version of charlie s angels which had a huge male fan base because those films were fun  and full of action and made no attempt to tell you about feminism but itshowed it without advertising it. and the 3 ladies were sexy all on their own right their own way.
12 07I always think of that whenever something like this comes up weither its movies  tv  or sports when they fail they come after men like we did something personally to them  but looking at the numbers they re more than enough women to make all that a success they dont really need men  but the fact that they fail to appeal to the majority of women as well as men says a lot  Im always hearing how out of touch hollywood is  but I think hollywood women are more out of touch.
it is that hard for hollywood to respect all people and making fun content for everyone instead of always attacking a specific group and then cry when they dont want to support you
this lady came out and said point plank  Im not making movies for men  or something...men were like...ok cool  we ll skip it then...and now she s all...reeeeeeeee why didn t men see my movie !
just wondering  have you changed your makeup style as an experiment  you look fine either way  of course  but you hadn t mentioned it like you did your hair being let remain curly. was it like a test to see if anyone would notice or say anything  not that it matters  but just was curious as to if there was a reason for the change or like just too much to do in a day or something.
a movie with brie and morfydd... holy shieeeet that would be one nuclear explosion.
and frosk should have a cameo.
well said
it literally was 100  her doing it and thats so obvious from how much she s trying to shift the blame
I also didn t go to see either of the charlie s angels movies that drew barrymore was in  yet they did well  they were successful. so maybe  just maybe  there was another problem the banks version.
that tumbnail of them posing trying to look tough should be embarrassing to whoever was in charge of training and choreography. even a couple lessons of basic boxing or kickboxing would teach you not to hold your elbows out to the side like that. one kick to the liver would also teach you never to do that again  and briefly make youregret being born because it is immensely painful  debilitatingly so .atomic blonde and alita  battle angel did a good job with this. even frail little freya allan in the witcher series looked fairly convincing thatshe was taking a hard falls in witcher training the way it was shot and acted. of course there are wires  effects  stunt doubles  ect. to keep their actors from harm  but make it look convincing that your action star has even trained for a day in their lives and make the combat and stunts look at least somewhat believable.
I also like birds of prey   most of those movies   I agree
the marketing killed it and salted the earth to ensure the damage stayed.  it could have played up kirsten to more than the twilight girl but instead used her to enforce the ideals of the typical twilight fans.  it didn t carry over and the normies they were trying to appeal to didn t join them en mass like they thought.  some target ones did  but not enough.  that is because even a good amount of normies are fed up with tryhards that think they are the first to do what they re doing
1 50  be self aware  okay  I think mac forgot to whom she s speaking to.if there s one characteristic that I d describe hollywood with besides  something to do with movies  it would be the utter lack of self awareness  d
amazing! how could that add up!!!! Iman I thought hate would result in more watchers!
I didn t even know they did a remake of it .
girl I forgot this happened
that just what my make believe movie needs  real world! someone please tell hollywood its ok to use more than 1 brain cell at a time!
im waiting on my copy of isom as we speak. I imagine I ll get mine later cause I wasn t on the ball  lol
yk the funniest thing ive ever heard was when a she hulk page said the show isnt for us then they proceed to call men sexist incel and blame the low rating on men when we dont watch it or like it
2000 s charlie s angels duology actually a bit cheezybut those movies are still a very fun to watch
maybe Im remembering wrong but didn t she literally say this movie isn t for men or something  hard to blame the marketing there.
we love a good lara reference
anyone else grew up watching totally spies  im a guy and even I grew up watching powerpuff girls  and kill bill is still a great movie  they didn t have to bash guys  they just made good shows and movies that just so happened to have female lead characters  like kim possible
the last good movie elizabeth banks was in was the next three days where she spent most of the movie in jail
did you or would you  ever link up stream on  friday night tights  with nerd  critical drinker  shad  ryan  etc... I think you would be a valid addition.
woh! you mentioned lara croft and I wanted to comment about her while listening to your video. she was one of the firsts to be sacrificed. subscribe
if she wanted this to be popular with a wider audience  then she just should have taken a look at the original movies. because they were very popular with all kind of people.
banks version is very annoying. in that movie  the only men that can stand with them is their gay beta men as supportive character. other men including charlie is turning bad. no wonder people hate this movie
ahahah no bash guys  ron always losing his pants... xd
@fjparasite  true  I look at ron like shaggy  he s clumsy but somehow finds a way to come out on top most of the time
in the current woke environment  people s expectations can be shaped by statements sentiments like   this movie was not made for you  and lead them to expect the worst of the production.  it was the expectation of those resorting to such statements to believe thatsomehow it would bolster their production.  then when the success does not materialize  to blame the people  this movie was not made for  for the failure.  it absolves the production of any sins like badly written characters  unrealistic situations  unreasonable expectations  etc.  for ms. banks  now  if she wanted to make a  real  action movie  she has a supposed  action movie  by her own statement under her belt and that would likely weigh on backer s minds when considering what to do with her next proposal for an action movie or whether she should direct it.
I remember watching the original charlies angels when I was a kid  then this shit came out...... lmao
until quite recently... it was taken for granted that the business of the artist was to delight and instruct his public.... and an artist might lead his public on to appreciate finer things than they had wanted at first  but he could do this only by being  from the first  if not merely entertaining  yet entertaining  and if not completely intelligible  yet very largely intelligible. all this has changed. in the highest aesthetic circles one now hears nothing about the artist s duty to us. it is all about our duty to him. he owes us nothing  we owe him  recognition   even though he has never paid the slightest attention to our tastes  interests  or habits. if we dont give it to him  our name is mud. in this shop  the customer is always wrong.  - c. s. lewisand to think he wrote this quote in 1959
okay uhmmm your absolutely cute .  I just subbed. and also yes hating on dudes wont make people tune into your movies. she hulk is a great example.
its a shame there had been a disconnect in the marketing side. I remember thatsuper-realistic first scene where a man was trying to seduce a woman by explaining her how inferior she was  thatsurely didn t seem like a feminist manifesto  but pure action-movie material.
the moment someone stated  x movie is only meant for x people   they ruined the whole thing.and since anger gets more clicks and likes  its now what s mostly manufactured as we ride the algorithm rollercoaster into our own graves.
you should watch the critical drinker. his youtube channel is movie reviews but he is honest about it. he does this  the message  thing that is awesome.
off topic  you look amazing with the natural look  mel.
plus  kathryn bigelow is a great action movie director. and I never hear about it.
awesome! I should be getting my isom copy soon  then! got a signed on the way. yessuuhhh!!
the thing with men is  we have no problems being told something isnt made for us because we can find something else to keep us entertained like elden ring or peter jackson s lotr . like the rest of hollywood  eb thinks by shamming men thatsomehow we ll show up lol nah  thats not how men work  we dont mind being hated  alot of us thrive when hated.
imagine if shopping channel qvc started insulting their audience
charlie s angels  but just the angels who dont need no man. literally ejected charlie from his own movie.
well spoken  not pushing her personal agenda on us. .and what s this   looks absolutely fantastic with little to no make up   you are becoming a rare breed in today s world. .after I finish this album..I would love to put in the work to take you out  not simping lolz just speaking facts
to think that this woman is in charge of the flintstones reboot and will voice pebbles...
people can generally tell the difference between a victim and someone playing the victim.
banks didn t make bank on her movie   shocker
Im an advertising executive. the worst thing you can do is attack the audience you want to support you  or buy your stuff. unfortunately there is this new idea that you can shame people into supporting you  and it never works. I dont know how these people keep their jobs.
I watched some of the movie when it came out on cable. it wasn t very good. as you said  banks never talks about the quality of the movie when she defends it.
I forgot that they rebooted that movie. goes to show how well it was I guess.
love him.  trying to read all his nonfiction now.  what essay is this quote from
@talitha koum    me too  this quote is from  good work and good works.
@Godrules311  thank you!
that guy from bros should give her a call. sounds like she learned something that would be of use to him.
I didn t even know there was a new charlie s angels. good to know to avoid it.
in defense of elizabeth banks  whatever comes out her mouth is a result of the studio s marketing department. since they are writing her paychecks she needs to tow the line. we can say the same thing about any statement that comes from an actor...it all goes back to the woke marketing department who controls everything an actor might say.
well you ve gained a new subscriber here
yo only 2 22 into it  you got my like and sub. nuff said homie you got a good head on your shoulders.
I love this girl! she nails the big issues! your a perfect critic! thank you for highlighting the problems these female celebs just cant see. men and women are not enemies! we are different but compliment each other s strengths and weaknesses! why is thatso hard to see  not one man! has a problem with a female lead role in an action movie! or directing one. in fact we encourage it! but it has no bearing in reality that all women are stronger and have to replace men altogether! we are designed to provide and protect  its not a bad thing  its noble!
be careful what you ask for  you might get it
well said melanie.
she wanted to star in the movie so bad  you cantell.
her problem isn t that hollywood wont let women direct big budget action franchises  its that hollywood wont let elizabeth banks direct big budget action franchises.
you know the interesting thing is thatshe said if the movie fails its because of men yet that in itself probably pissed off in the people man and women that they did not want to watch the movie also if you go back way in the day the first two charlie angels in the was it late  90s early 2000 did amazing from the support of men and women also one of my favorite movies have it on a blu-ray. these directors these individuals that have this mindset need to learn the majority of population is women but the majority of your target audience when it comes to action movies sci-fI horror its going to be guys and I ll obviously everyone enjoys those types of movies well but Im just saying if its not like a marvel movie like top gun Im pretty sure most guys went to watch that or the majority I watch that movie were guys anyways I digress you just have to make the movie for everyone to enjoy you dont have to advertise it like an ass advertise it for everyone.
I want to know what her logic was  because making money couldn t have been in the equation.
the previous angel s movies were cheesy but fun and embraced men liking watching all three being normal sexy selves. even the original series was for men and that was the point.
one of the big problems that hollywood is creating all on their own is when they edit these trailers.  I have no idea what they are thinking but they are not thinking   let s make a trailer that ll make people want to come see this movie.
elizabeth banks going boom is never as lovable and endearing as when melonie mac does it... but still entertaining. crazy how the  we hate you  now love us!  mentality is the one hurdle the blue-haired people are still stumbling over the hardest. Imiss the good old days when studio greed trumped all else in hollywood and determined the level of movie messaging.
we really like  the 355  and  gunpowder milkshake .  both were pretty much all female action movies.
her antI apology apology. she still wedged in that they wont let a woman direct a mission impossible movie comment. no  lizzy banks  just you. I guess she has one of them ironic names now cause she is definitely not money in the bank ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh!!!!
I didn t even know there was a new charlie s angels.Im still waiting on my isom  1
she s 48 and acts like a child. no accountability  Imean how can a person grow like that.
the absolute crazy stuff you come up with. Imean what are the odds !
maybe they didn t want to give someone that has no experience in action movies a multI billion dollar franchise just to see them run it into the ground with 30 cuts per second in their  action  scenes  vapid dialogue about closets of their dreams  and playing world traveller bingo seeing how many countries they can visit.she made a movie that is a point by point breakdown as to why she is not asked to make a mission impossible movie
funny thing  youtube put a link to watch the 90s charlie s angels next to this video.
I remember watching this movie and rolling my eyes constantly. a new male character appears on screen  here are our 3 options  a dumb douchebag  an evil enemy  or a servile wimp. thats it. when elizabeth banks s character suddenly became a suspect  I immediately said   nope  she cant be the villain  she s a woman! the villain has to be the old white guy!  and guess what  the villain was  indeed  the old white guy! what a twist! I cringed especially hard when the character played by luis gerardo m ndez came on screen  the saint . he s basically this eunuch-type guy whose only goal is serving the female agents of the charles townsend detective agency.   he takes care of our health and well-being   let s say that if an equivalent female character was created and made to serve a bunch of male agents  there would be an outrage. also  its always hilarious to see a bunch of 5 3  120 pounds women obliterating 6 3   250 pounds men in close combat. the movie wasn t terrible. but it wasn t great either. it was at least a little entertaining.
dont give your money to people who hate you.
another horror-action movie directed by a female  which Ive long enjoyed  is ravenous  1999 .
the original angel engaged in hand to hand an gun combat. I have everything angel s.
its elizabeth banks. if youre waiting on her to own up to any of her failings  you might pack a lunch.
hurt locker was top notch.  I was so happy it beat out avatar for the oscar   and the fact thatshe s a woman had nothing to do with it!!...though the fact thatshe s cameron s ex didn t hurt lol.
I dont even bother watching new hollywood movies  there s a lotta old ones that I haven t seen  I just watch them.
7 45 I dont think that is necessarily true actually. charlie s angels has always been like this from the original series to the 2000 and 2003 movies to the 2019 movie. this pose is actually  call sign of charlie s angels - and I wouldn t condemn a movie only because one of the actresses has short hair.8 33 well  I d say looking at the new picture that the woman in the middle is extremely feminine - no man would ever wear something like that.10 52 well if that was the goal then it failed - the kind of cloths the girl in the middle is wearing is made to garner male attention  not divert it.ps  lara croft from the 2013 game is by far the sexiest iteration of the character. she s super pretty  she s badass and she s sexy af. in contrast to what you seem to believe...men like women that look realistic at least as much  usually more  than women who have such big breasts that they will topple over unless they use a walking stick for balance reasons. the original lara croft cannot be considered to be all thatsexy because of the graphics and lara in some of the later games looks like a victim of too much cosmetic surgery. 2013 lara croft was a real breath of fresh air  unfortunately rise of the tomb raider and especially shadow of the tomb raider where less good .before people start hating - yes I have played all the tomb raider games at release. yes I am that old. and yes I am a man.regarding the 2019 charlie s angels...the movie was just nothing special. its wasn t bad  it wasn t particularly good either  it was just ok. im the case of movies that are just average  which isn t bad - average doesnt mean bad it only means it is just standard!  I think the marketing is more important than in the case of movies that are really  really outstanding.last but not least it is not easy these days to create something really new and refreshing. tens of thousands of movies exist - there s no idea ot theme that hasn t been used countless times already. and it is even harder to do in existing franchises because it is inevitable that people will compare the new entry to the franchise with the older ones...and it is unavoidable thatsome people will be dissapointed because they had certain expectations that are not fullfilled.
notice how like 5 of the 10 female directed movies they feature are all directed by kathryn bigelow now if I had an agenda I could say they only let a couple females direct action films in hollywood  aka now georgiawood . what it actually tells me is if you are great at your job and directed good films like strange days  the hurt locker  blue steel  point break  etc  etc then you will be rewarded to direct more. this is how itshould work. the best directors regardless of sex  sexual orientation  race  politics  etc  etc  etc should be promoted to the top!
and this is why she is hosting a game show!
elizabeth banks wishes the marketing team had done a better job at tricking men into watching the movie. even if the trailers were sliced a different way   the movie speaks for itself .
your cuteness is so powerful  makes me so distracted  when I watch your videos
think fans would prefer a continuation of the original  like they did with bad boys
mac be boomin  it up!!
great vid hit the nail right on the head
who would ve thought that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
charlie s angel s was so bad  imagine she got her hands on mission impossible
all hail queen melonie

for me wonder woman is the best example of a perfect and completely noble feminist cause  it focuses on diana s story and development as a strong hero but they dont set all men aside or even painting them as all evil or useless  they even give diana a male cast to back her side and a romantic interest which works perfectly cuz neither one of them diana or steve are in full need of each other thus it doesnt take anything away from diana s nor steve s character. movie sends a full on well built message that everyone understand as well  mostly women but men as well  besides everyone Ive met no matter the age that has seen the movie always say its freaking amazing. ww its truly a once in a lifetime film and imo the perfect way example to portray a movie with a meaningful backstory and message to audiences
they made a charlie s angels movie in 2019    did anyone market it
cute voice melanie mac back with another awesome video
strange days is such a good movie
it must be frustrating for women that you have someone like elizabeth banks who speak on your behalf  but doesnt remotely represent anything that you want.
notice a whole bunch of the most successful movies were directed by katheryn bigelow who s been in the movie making game for almost 100 000 years  whereas banks is known as an actress  and has how many directing credits    its says she has 7 on imdb but some haven t even been made yet and some are just shorts. so she has like 2 or 3 real directing credits.  who s going to give a rookie director their big budget action blockbuster until you ve proven that you have successful movies to show on your resume
I didn t know said movie existed until this video melonie
hey melonie are going review the rest of first season of ring of powers  we love to see you suffer but on a serious note love watching your videos  you are awesome
like or not  the og charlie s angels had always targeted men as its main audience.now imagine doing what she did and still expect men to watch it.
as someone who actually watched the movie  the only one man bashing was elizabeth banks s character  none of the three girls were bashing men
the giant figurine deal you have in your room has the head of the woman in the image at 8 04 and its fucking hilarious.
so it took them that long to connect the dots  guess hollywood s actors i.q. is dropping by the day or they are really that arrogant that they thought people were going to watch them regardless of how they treated the audience.
its crazy  when you tell men they aren t wanted... they go away dont show up. who would have thought.
have you seen the bio pic the charlie s angels story feminist hounded the original cast saying they where setting women back they came after the actress  for wearing a white bikinI pretty hard till she started crying over it
most hollywood types these days are total narcissists who cant understand that attacking their audience is wrong. its all about them and their hurt rather than making profit.
I love your channel.
melonie is being awfully sassy today
if a person of the opposite sex try to write a character they are trying to identify as thatsex. if you want to move forward you should allow thatso long as it doesnt turn into some sexploitative freak show. really let these things get made then critique them afterwards. the box office will answer most questions
for me its not even hating on its targeted demographic  if any people that work on a movie hate on any demographic that immediately turns me off. you shouldn t treat any customers  whether its me or not  horribly
honestly  doesnt matter how it was marketed.  even if people have showed up in theaters to watch it  as soon as they realized what garbage of a movie it was  word of mouth would have killed it in its tracks during the first week.
haha I sure will!  d
you had to bring up lara croft!
alienate your target demo!!!!!! what s the worst that could happen
whenever Imake it this story it becomes this story ftfy
the original charlies angels... they were all smart and capable women.
punisher war zone was leaps and bounds better than the other punisher movies too.
banks literally said that this move  wasn t for men  and then complained that it was flop because no men went to see it.
hey go boom! you gotta kill billish vibe goin  on today.
reminds me of that lesbian vampire show netflix cancelled and the creator complained the marketing focused too much on them being lesbian vampires
how canthey forget the matrix     its one of the greatest action movies and directed by a female
Im a guy. I liked the pitch perfect movies.  I really liked the first one the two sequels got progressively silly but were still fun to watch and had some good scenes.
ok  I gotta make sure that indiana black  aka frosk  and elizabeth banks are not the same person wearing disguises.
I like kristen stewart she was great in jumper  twilight  zathura and the underrated underwater  the reason I didn t even try to watch charlie s is because they told us not to its not for me  apparently so...okay  too much media and limited time we can skip things  not made for us
anybody can direct any type of movie. they ultimately want too. some will like it. others want like it.
I didn t even know this movie existed. great marketing
literally the opening sequence of the movie were random women and young girls just doing things lol had nothing to do with the movie
I d like to hear melonie mac go boom talking about the best action movies with female leads. I ll start the list  jackie brown  kill bill I and iI  salt.
point break  the original  directed by kathryn bigelow.you want an example of a woman that can director damn good action  kathryn bigelow. notice how she has at least 3 films on that list.
but I say it again I imagine if someone was to do the numbers about 80  of the people that watch a movie or tv show has no idea who directed it or care what matters in a movie is how good the director is and how well the stories written and take it from me the movies in the  80s and  90s and the 2000s they work some great gone with the wind amazing world changing movies some of them a lot of them had corny dialogue and it was silly one liners but its what we wanted and it was good they ve had the same formula and they cant figure it out I believe like I said in the other one they are trying to change the culture completely thats why I do not believe that these movie studios disney or any of them are going to take the hint no matter how much money they lose when the next five years the people thatstart watching movies and tv will be the kind that likes the garbage they re told to like
no show which wants mainstream appeal should ever be hating on men as part of their marketing. most of the time  unless maybe its a soap opera or telenovela  men make up the majority of the viewing audience. our video series and comic book  for example  has a customer base of over 90  males. its just bad business to turn away a large chunk of your customers  so you know if a show does engage in man-hating  they have some other agenda in mind other than just turning a profit  and someone behind the scenes is just ok with throwing money away to achieve it.
I dont hate you because youre fat  youre fat because I hate you  - mean girls
I actually enjoy bridesmaid movie than pitch perfect. Im men
@bobo boy  bridesmaids was pretty good.  it had some humor that didn t hit with me  but was still enjoyable. I really liked most of the musical numbers in the pitch perfect franchise  so I rate it above bridesmaids.
the original point break is the greatest movie of all time.
imagine youre only happy if your so is miserable. and they wonder why men are done
strange days was awesome. no idea who directed it and I dont care. it was good. done.
ridley scott directed alien.  james cameron wrote and directed terminator and sarah connor.  thomas harris created clarice in silence of the lambs.  men just tend to write better characters that happen to be women vs how nowadays people write women characters as their vessels for agendas.
do people go see movies anymore  why  I was thinking of seeing a movie a few months ago  but I still haven t found anything worth seeing. 30th anniversary of poltergeist was out  but I just watched it at home.
seems to me they only make movies to upset the  normies.  hint  most normies dont think of themselves as normies. we re all nerds  geeks and weirdos in our own special way.....
when I think of charlies angels I think of cameron diaz dancing in spiderman undies
wow melonie is not only the most beautiful girl I ever seen on youtube  but very wise with her witty remarks about current events today. also I love when she just repeats what Im thinking to the tee lol thanks and dont ever change.
one of the problems was that all of the guys in the movies were morons or women hating.  even charlie  the guy who heads the group  was a woman.  I went to the theaters to see this and I left feeling bland.  I think if banks would have made this a normal movie with good guys and bad guys good girls and bad girls  then it would have worked better.  I also didn t get a good feel for the main characters.  one of the appeal with the 2000 s version was that cameron diaz  lucy luI  and drew berrymore were so different that it was easy to see their strengths individually and as a team.  but we didn t have that in this movie.  last point  you can market a movie any way you want  but when you watch the film  itsays what you want it to say.  itsaid that in that world  all guys are dogs and sexist.  I like female led movies.  just make people normal  and not a stereotype and people will watch it.
for real  I never would have guessed
a couple of issues I have with banks   statement regarding the  marketing  1  she s the one who told the media that the film failed because of misogynistic attitudes the week after its disastrous opening weekend.2  it wasn t the marketing thatsank it  it was the content. Im all about equal time for everyone and Ive fully embraced the move toward more inclusivity and diversity in entertainment  but even by the most forgiving standards that version of charlie s angels was driven by pure antImale sentiment. given that men do in fact drive the majority of the box office in the action genre and that no one was really calling for yet another big screen charlie s angels movie  itshouldn t have surprised anyone that it failed. it was a bad movie made by people who completely misread the room.  ironically  in the aftermath of the film I actually saw more videos posted by women trashing the movie then men. the same thing happened with terminator dark fate.
top secret hating on men will make them not watch her movie I just discover it with great sacrifice
its really sad in this time how women would rather discard their femininity instead of see it as a benefit. the whole  male gaze  thing is such a non point because if you look at who watches these shows movies or plays these video games its largely men. many of us just want authenticity and sticking to the source material. the idea that they think men tune into these products cuz there s a woman in a provocative manner in it is insulting.
also gal gdot doesnt trash men or tell them the movie wasn t made for them.
hurt locker really is a good movie.
these people seem like subhumans because they have to take a lot of financial risks that are completely pointless other than to just line people s pockets. its basically a game.
marketing woes aside  the movie would have been a success if it had believable action scenes  interesting characters and was well written.  I think thats what gets lost in a lot of the culture war nonsense - if you just create compelling art people will watch it.  its really just thatsimple  stop trying to check off boxes and start making quality
is banks really suggesting they should have marketed pitch perfect 2 to men  she really is insane. thank God her marketers knew better than her.
kathryn bigelow!nothing else need to be said.
13 34 God... we were so close to this in the 2000s. the regression back to distrust over trivial physical attributes is so fucking sad.
she s definitely a cut above the rest.and she s beautiful  inside and out.
she also said there are 30 spider-man movies where are the charlies angels spider-man is relevant.
exactly she says ww is for everyone and itshows m w working togrther instead of wasting time with nonsensical sht
so... the woman who directs all the great action movies is kathryn bigelow.
elizabeth banks burned the bridge to her audience. she  like most of hollywood  felt entitled to a successful movie and could say or insult anyone she wanted. that is what happens when you live in the woke hollywood bubble. her regret means nothing. audiences will not be back. she can pound dirt.
entertainment is escapism.  beauty sells.  good looking men and women
if I recall I remember her bashing spider-man far from home as another reason charles angels failed due to more interest in spidey cuz itstared a  man no elizabeth  it was watched more because itstared one of the most popular super heroes in the world  was the end of phase 3 of the mcu  and was an epilogue to endgame... a movie that at one point was the highest grossing film of all time. plus didn t captain marvel and the first wonder woman make bank at the box office too  so seems that claim about no one being interested in women lead action films just got two recent examples that claim otherwise.
owen wilson reaction to this subject   wow
3 15 here s a better question  if hollyweird is making things hard on her because misogyny  why was she publicly hating on the audience rather than on hollyweird   how is punching down the appropriate response when being  oppressed
I think they forget men aren t the same high school boys. they can insult and would still follow them around like little puppies. men aren t the love sick high school simp  half the time doesnt know better and pretty much is too fascinated by the body and full of hormones to pay attention to any words coming out of the mouth. as a man  we know the game  and there s plenty options.
I like u  glad I found your channel!
thank God banks hasn t been given the opportunity to direct a mImovie.. it would be the instant death of the franchise.I dont even think tom cruise would sign up for it tbfh.
funny part is that I didn t know it was a woman directing the movie
at least the original charlie s angels looked like fully grown women  and were very attractive. the latest iteration  looks more like troubled teens who cant afford decent clothes   make-up and cut themselves when they get nervous.
the old guard was definitely more than good.
I hate the way they say objectify when irl they wear see threw shirts cheeks out. but in a movie let me cover up
melonie what for me about the latest charlie s angels movie was one fight scene   when one of the angels was beating a martial arts expert   that you could easily see that had been trained in the martial arts their whole life   and getting beat by person that   looked like they couldn t fight their way out of a wet paper bag that is super thin   now the sex had nothing to do with it   like in the 1970 s there was a woman action star in hong kong   that could defeat men easily   but it came across realistic except for all the fighters doing beyond human ability . but that actress why she was believable and not the one in the latest charlie s angels reboot was not   well the actress in the 1970 s hong hong kung fu flicks   that actress was trained in martial arts ever since she was a little child   started in kung fu as a child then in adult years in a korean martial art   she was believable   and I enjoyed watching her beating up men   even though I was a man   I know in real life she probably could have beaten me in a real fight   where as that one in the charlie angles reboot I just might would have won lol
I dont even know who the director is for any given movie until I watch it  unless its spielberg or someone really big . who chooses movie based on director  let alone the director s sex
men and women like different things.  most women I know love shopping. they are happy to spend hours trying on clothes or shoes. most men dont care for that pastime. we are being conditioned to be at odds with each other. either by sex or race. if we are fighting we aren t seeing things happening in the real world.
for bop  I say youre better off with the tv show.
like youtube and twitch  a woman can be in their swimsuit but when a male do it they get in trouble
the marketing was a fraction of why the movie failed. the core movie had all women portrayed to be very smart and capable of anything even when the movie shows one to be the nerd  one is street smart  and the other is the brawler type. further in the film  we see these characters achieve everything with no faults completely dismantling what the story was trying to set up these characters as. in the end  we had a movie so hyper-focused on gender and how all men are evil with characters so one-dimensional even to an audience member not aware of the cultural attack going on in the film they saw for what it was. just another boring movie.
so the charlie s angels was about the same as bird of prey it like if can put the marketing out of your mind.but this is a problem for like every other tv show and movies
banks and viola davis are like two peas in a pod. they trash their target audience  and still expect them to go to their movies. wtf.
I thought about your comment. could the hong kong actress martial arts star youre talking about be michelle yeoh  she s the only woman I canthink of that fits your description.
@may loo  now I really like michelle yeoh   no   it is one a well to be nice   a little older her name was angela mao   she had the nick name lady whirlwind   she was in a movie called deep thrust no not the porn flick thatstarred linda love lace just a little side humor   and co starred in a movie called when tae kwon do strikes with tae kwon do master jhoon rhee   no michelle yeoh she is very good   I like  watching her   thankyou for your reply
@jerryhickey  I guess Im too young to have remembered angela mao. also  didn t watch kung fu movies in the 70s. only name I knew was bruce lee.
@may loo  funny you should mention bruce lee   she made an appearance in bruce lee s movie enter the dragon   yea she goes back to the 1970 s   she was good
as a woman  I wish I had the money to spend hours on shopping for clothes or shoes. further  Imake art  and I d rather be in an art supplies store than any shoe  clothes or jewelry store.
@may loo  I know this is very hard for you  but listen closely. and re-read what I said. are you a woman I know personally  no. do yourepresent all women as a  woman   no.  enjoy shopping at your art store... as a woman who hates shopping.  most men I know do not enjoy going shopping for anything. as a goldfish  today  I can say that most men I know go into a shop knowing what they want. they buy the item then leave. they dont enjoy shopping.  as a woman I wish you had basic comprehension  skills.  did I say that women buy everything they see in a shop  no. women enjoy the act of shopping. that means they enjoy going to and spending time in shops as you admitted to.  extra credit  go into a dept store and go to the perfume cosmetics counter. it will be huge and it is aimed at people with xx chromosomes.  the men s section is one shelf with a few smellys on it.  my point still stands that men and women like different things.
agree
here s the thing  even the other charlie s angels movies  bad as they are  had male characters who could also kick ass and were really kind people!meanwhile there were also women who were devious villains in said movies as well. neither gender is favored too or demonized over the other.men and women kicking ass together is epic. fact of life
I watched this movie  not when it was in theaters  but when it was on tv once  it was mediocre for the most part  it wasn t bad  until the ending where everyone is an angel.  spoiler   it removes the idea that angels are special  to quote syndrome from incredibles  if everyone s super  no one will be.
melonie I got another fact that will blow her mindwater is in fact wet
we didn t need another reboot of the tv series. it was already done and successfully with actresses who could act...unlike kristen stewart. I saw the promos and had no interest at all in seeing it. Ive been watching charlie s angels since the first episode in the 70 s.
what I like about charlie s angels 2000 was about beatifull women that are badass and kickass...  and they have lucy liu...
thatshould be a slogan. entertainment is an escape  to ground it in the real world is boring
I really dont understand how they can lack enough common sense to make a movie that only tailors to a very specific crowd and then get upset when other people dont come to it... thats literally like making a straight porn then getting all confused and upset at everyone when gay people dont wanna come see it...it absolutely baffles me the amount of ignorance it takes to actually think that would make sense.
the irony is that most of those thatstill watched her movie were still men.for a movie not made for them  where are the women that were supposed to see a movie made for them
you need to make a hair tutorial video for your female viewers  because more women need to do that hairstyle. its extremely feminine and could probably make most women jump up 2 to 3 points on the old 1-10 looks scale. dead serious. I have a little sister who goes to a pentecostal church and the women there have hair like yours and its f-kng hot. Im not simping for you  I just really wish women would grow out their hair and leave the pixie look in the 1920s where it belongs.
hollywood is full of savages!!!!!
regrets the marketing    notice how she attempts to distance herself from the cause of the backlash four words elizabeth  the. internet.  is.  forever!that includes you insulting  complaining  male-bashing    shaming  men in interviews pubic appearances!  not some vague  distant  marketing department   but you.even now  when she is trying to  curry favor   i.e. lure back the straight  white male audience  and  quote unquote   apologize   she still tries to shift blame!
the old guard was a great film.
I always laugh when these woke misandristic women accuse men of everything in the world without giving specific examples and then either cant figure out why or just go ballistic when they get backlash for it.
if your avoiding a stressful movie situation then you wont or shouldn t get work.everyone has a movie they regret because they obviously needed the money or filler in there resume.she could of quit the job like several others people have quit director position in bad movies.
the people who complain about objectification are often the once who are the most objective of themselves and others.
wonder woman not bashing men  the producer and promoters may not have been.the main actress may have even kept her mouth shut when that one was being released.but I remember her bashing a member of the monty python team  the exact details escape me but what she was bashing him for saying was as innocuous and patently sensible as suggesting thatsomething like the idea of due process and the presumption of innocence might just possibly be things that we probably shouldn t throw out.was during the me too movements high point.so I will never pay for anything she s in ever again.
I got my isom  1 too!!
its amazing to me that a film like  charlie s angels  got pitched  written  funded  cast  shot  edited  marketed  tested  and released--a process that takes years--and no one with influence throughout that long process said   hey  you know what    this shit isn t going to fly.  this is an action movie  and the audience for it will be largely male  framing the entire story as  man bad grrrl power good!  is just going to guarantee the thing fails.  the old  ca  films from 20 years ago proved that there is an audience for this property  but we have to respect the fact that a large portion of that audience  probably the majority  were then and continue now to be male.  we can still have movie with a  female empowerment  theme  but if the whole script  and our marketing campaign  and all the interviews with the cast and director basically tell the bulk of potential customers to fuck off  thats exactly what they ll do.  and since none of us want to lose millions of dollars  let s figure out how to fix this script so that it has at least a fighting chance of being successful.   hundreds of millions of dollars  and people s jobs and reputations on the line  and still no one had the balls  literally or figuratively  to admit what the entire world knew from the minute the first trailer dropped   this was a movie that had no audience  and it was destined to be a failure.
same thing with any youtuber actor what ever your fan base makes youre career you hate on them they can destroy your career but not watching you anymore or of some form supporting you
the best movie with an all female cast  at least to me  is still the descent. I saw that movie in the theater back in the day and still enjoy it to this day  its an awesome claustrophobic gory horror movie and it was a hit  of course it was directed by a man so it doesnt count.
two women directed mandalorian episodes as well. plus producers might feel that a female director might instill feminist ideals into the script that weren t there originally so there might be some gun shyness there
long live the rippaverse!!!
yes  the original cast were all beautiful and feminine and it was a fun show  and I can vouch that jaclyn smith is not only aging beautifully  she s a sweet lady too. Ive met her a couple times in person and she is still lovely. dressing women like men will drive men away because they look like  well  guys. were it not for the  male gaze   most hollyweird actresses wouldn t have a career  and you cantake that to the bank.
no try hard make upno tank top with belly showingmakes me think you might have something to say.first video I fully watched.
the hurt locker is a brilliant dark movie. at risk of sounding sexist I was shocked to find out who the director was.
the original charlie s angels tv show was written and produced by a man  and the show was very successful.
wait  there was a new charlies angels movie  when
it cracks me how youre hearing from certain women that the lack of success in a particular movie is due to  men    sexism  and  men not liking movies with strong female leads . did it ever occur to them that maybe the movie is just shit  Imean  in the case of charlie s angels ... you have the original series from decades ago  then the reboot in 2000  then the follow up reboot to that in 2003 ... and now we have yet again another reboot. you think maybe viewers have had enough of charlie angels and the premise  they honestly think audiences are going to be rushing to see this  I personally think it was a bad idea to start with. thats the problem with reboots ... the premise has been used  abused and thrashed enough ... its boring. lazy movie making.and as for this bullshit theory of  men dont like movies with strong female leads  ... have they never heard of tomb raider  g.i. jane  kill bill  black widow  long kiss goodnight  old guard  terminator 2  wonder woman  alien  underworld  hunger games  resident evil  crouching tiger hidden dragon ... all great movies with a big male following. any more excuses
melonie  you are forgetting that almost nobody in hollywood has any self-awareness. dont you know that all the millionaire actors actresses are victims didn t realize point break was directed by a woman. good movie.
the last time kristen stewart looked normal and was in a tolerable movie was zathura a space adventure. almost reason enough to skip any new movie.
melonie please review  run sweetheart run  and  the invitation
banks is lying to make herself look good. we all know what she said in the lead up to the release. judging what reviewers have said it was a woke film from the start. it was written to be woke. so yes banks is right the marketing was shit. but also so was the film. I haven t seen it and dont want too either. banks cant accept she made a bad film. its nice to see someone come out and admit they messed up. it also would be nice if she told the whole picture not just trying to make herself look good. go woke go broke and yet hollywood haven t stopped. surely the message is getting through by now right
she still didn t get it completely... humans never admit.
its true women I used to find attractive that are to left I instantly find repulsive and vice versa. when I see a women thats more conservative I find them exceptionally attractive.
I wanted to give it a chance so I watched it in the theater. the movie was fine  all the men looked like idiots or were evil. it was the last 30 minutes of the movie where it truly failed. the whole rather campy plot devolved into a really cheap-looking commercial.
melonie   congrats on 55 k have you played days gone its really fun
contrary to popular belief  men can be quite good at listening. tell us a movie or product is not for us  we will not partake. simple as that.
I dont know some men like to be dominated and bullied  just saying   to be clear Im not one of those   I swear .
its the same argument from bill burr  works perfectly here. action movies are dominated by men because men are the market. however  men do not care who the director is if its a good movie. I saw charlie s angels and I thought it was meh  and I had no idea who the director was. it was an alright script with alright characters  with a bad ending. not even patrick stewart could save it.that being said  this was a movie where charlie and bosley  the two men involved in the team  have been replaced by women and og bosley is justifiably pissed off. elizabeth banks was right  there s very little to appeal to men in a movie that portrays all the males in the cast as either villains or eunuchs.
at 2 03  thank goodness melonie said this. I am so sick   tired of this crap. not just movies. everything. everything wrong must be men s faults these days. let me just say that I am  a straight white male. and honestly  I cant even turn my pc on most days without being force fed enough hate that I start feeling like I should apologize for existing!! I do appreciate when a woman admits that this isn t actually reality.
even in her desperate backpedalling she cant help but play the sexism card lol
thx for a balanced and positive breakdown of the woke shite infesting movies. good to know other people are on to this weirdness.
hate never wins!!!
I agree with you on most things  but charlie s angels was just a charlie s angels film. the international internet discourse threw it under the bus with bop wokeness. it was just a harmless ca film. elizabeth wasn t upset until her movie was killed unseen. should it have been a blockbuster  no. but it was the same level as the last two films. itshouldn t have been part of a separate discourse.
just copying this from the wikI page of kathryn bigelow  academy award winner for best director in 2009 for the hurt locker. this is a quote from 1990  from an interview with her for her film blue steel.  if there s specific resistance to women making movies  I just choose to ignore that as an obstacle for two reasons  I cant change my gender  and I refuse to stop making movies. its irrelevant who or what directed a movie  the important thing is that you either respond to it or you dont. there should be more women directing  I think there s just not the awareness that its really possible. it is.   kathryn bigelow in 1990
let them fail. let them think whatever they want.  and let them keep failing. only bankruptcy will teach them if indeed they have the capacity to be taught.
elizabeth banks is an incredibly mediocre actress who got roles based mainly from her physical appearance  so her attempts to mute the physical appearance of the actresses in her movies is ironic.  also  just because she was an actress  does not automatically make you a great director  see also johnny depp and james franco .  one thing thatsurprised me though was that penny marshall was not on the list of great female directors that was presented.  maybe because her movies were so good   youreally weren t thinking about the gender of the director  but were just enjoying the movie.
mission impossible has used the same director for the last two and the next two films so it is more about the person not the gender
she didnt acknowledge the problem at all  she blamed it on the marketing  instead of blaming it on a flawed politically handy caped product. after doing so  claims thatshe wished doing a mission impossible! so basically  she would like to market a millions and millions of dollars movie   to a fraction of society so small it could never cover its costs! and blaming it on sexism! wow. news flash  there are lots of amazing female actresses and directors that dont get her chances   because they aren t pretty! the arts world revolves both around skill and having contacts! and damn  the amount of dumb twisted dudes  many of them actually sexist!  that will fall for a nice pair of legs is ridiculous! if anything  she is on top of the privilege ladder  thats why she even gets these directing chances that many more capable women would die for.
imo the biggest issue is the characters dont make sense. the fighter just knows advanced chemistry and the scientist can just take guys out with a single blow
hey melanie  29 days til  halloween
wait a minute.   a movie reboot that no one was asking for with a cast whose biggest main cast name was probably kristen stewart   as compared to the previous ones which had much bigger names   some how failed to find success at the box office     hating on men  wasn t this movie s biggest problem.
didn t this also come out the same time as joker
I dunno  ms. banks. maybe  if you actually made an entertaining film w  a concise plot and endearing characters  then most of civilization wouldn t complain. then again  I d be considered a  toxic  male for having  particular tastes in film and tv shows.
elizabeth banks had a few problems going against her. the first being that nobody wanted a charlie s angels movie. plenty of studios thought that the franchise was dead. this was made evident when the reboot of the television show back in 2012 or 11 that was executive produced by drew barrymore didn t last three episodes. so there wouldn t have been much hype for a new movie anyway.then you add the fact that everyone was pushing this feminist agenda into the movie. kristen stewart confirming it. and then  you cantake one look at the trailer and understand that if you adopt the philosophy of man bad and woman good. you can predict the movie from start to finish.finally she complains about bad marketing but honestly what marketing  they put so little money into the actual marketing like trailers that nobody even knew when the movie was coming out. furthermore her saying and I quote   if this movie fails this just proves that men do not support women in action films.  more men walked away simply because of that. finally and Ive heard women say this  if it was made for women then where were the men that they want to see.
love videos like this  I am making my own but also adding that the movie bros bombed over the weekend. shocker right  because now here comes the derp murica is phobic so thats why it bombed. no the movie didn t appeal to anyone even the  target  audience of alphabet people. boy I cant wait to see if anyone on youtube says a single negative thing about black panther 2 when it comes out
I dont even care if the characters are men  women  lgbt or whatever. just make a good story! charlies angels is more of a draw than mission impossible but tom cruise works his ass off and doesnt complain. on the other hand  elizabeth banks ruined a great thing and is entitled that people are just  supposed to  because
I like elizabeth banks - she s gorgeous in power rangers.
referencing the misconception towards the film  banks said   it was very stressful  partly because when women do things in hollywood it becomes this story. what is this supposed to mean   when women do things in hollywood it becomes this story   seems to have the same semantic content as   well  you know.  banks is more articulate than this. was this quote lifted out of context which carries meaning   I wish that the movie had not been presented as just for girls  because I didn t make it just for girls   no  you kinda did. maybe you didn t intend to  but you did.    first  for girls  decision  casting kristen stewart in a lead role. kristen stewart has zero appeal to the kind of men who like action movies.    second  dressing them in cute  funky  quirky clothing  not sleek  sexy  active clothing    third  scattered  non-cohesive storyline.     keep itsimple  good guys on one side  bad guys on the other  one objective
some  like bigelow  of whom Im a big fan  just does it. banks just whines.
actually its different though  in banks version. charlie is the bad guy. this is contradict the lore of charlie s angels
not for the male gaze!  then you dont deserve the revenue generated from the male demographic.
Im patiently waiting for the upcoming mcu movie dead pool 3 to announce that its being updated in tone for a modern audience meaning woke lgbtq approved
doesnt seem like misandrist karen ever accepted any constructive criticism.
if I was a director  I would be objectifying the shit out of female leads  making me that money. just look at top gun and how cool that movie was for portraying the hero as competent and giving us realisting portrayal of the relationships present in it.
banks certainly did little to dissuade the public from believing the movie  was a feminist propaganda piece.also charlie s angels was a 1970s tv show which already had a remake. nobody was clamoring for another version
Imight watch it but Im not going to pay for it.
to be honest with you all  as a guy and big charlie s angels fan. Ive watched anything attached to the property except this new one. even the original reboot was better than this. as soon as I saw the trailer I noped out. youre right for a straight guy  seeing awesome beautiful women doing awesome dope shit. these people need to stop it with saying guys hate women because we dont support a tainted garbage product.
charlie s angels  regretsequel
the first wonder woman was such a success  besides gal gadot  because zack snyder wrote it  while in ww1984 patty had full control on the writing and went full leroy jenkins thus the failure.women can direct good movies but when it comes to write good scripts for action movies... oh boy...
the only way a  feminist  charlie s angels movie could ve worked out was if the movie was self-aware  using super kitsch barbarella outfits  pastel miniskirts  oversexualized bimbos a la austin powers  playing dumb-dumb just to please men  but then secretly kill bill the sh t out of random goons  child baiters and such  and nuking secret villain lairs just for fun between two missions  and to test their new weapons  etc. just having fun being disgustingly violent badass perfect little betties  while depicting dudes as primal macho 50 s-sean-connery clones who think they are in control  a bit like statham in spy - a wannabe alpha good-for-nothing f ckboy!
fact men like  sexy girl action explosion they dont watch for plotimagine failing with all those combine xd
I ll never understand why these people think anti-marketing actually works  as if straight whie men are going to say to themselves  oh  these hollywood folks are saying charlie s angels  bros and the woman king aren t for me  I ll show them!!  and throw money at these movies that they re being hen pecked at over  only to be blamed for their failure when nobody goes to see them.if you want to garner the biggest audience  telling a huge chunk of the population that  this isn t for you!  and calling them istaphobes is the absolute wrong way to go.
hImelonie  I got the same isom  1b cover you did.
one day  mean and women will be able to coexist again in movies. I d really enjoy going to a movie that does not have some misguided agenda.
long live the rippaverse!
hollywood  disney  and many other producers have saved me a lot of money over the past 10 years. there are very few movies that I want to spend money to go and watch. most movies simply suck these days. all these idiots trying to push an agenda have forgotten that you dont bite the hand that pays to see your movies. calling the fans racist  narcissistic  mysoginistic and also saying that your movie isn t made for certain groups isn t going to get people to spend money watching your movie. more people wont bother. disneyland and hollywood can burn to the ground for all I care. who am I . Im a simple guy who knows what he likes to watch on tv and on the big screen. I definitely wont watch woke shit. go woke. go broke.
2 19 lolI didn t like birds of prey  but Im not sure if that has anything to do with who directed it.
banks must have forgotten how goog search works. in the space of 23 seconds I found a demonstrable untruth to her statements in the revisionism of elizabeth above- she took on 3 or 4 separate roles  gladly or partly bc she didn t trust people around her  and totally owned the tone  gender stereotyping and essentialism of the movie. to say that  it would have been cool but marketing skrood up  is an abrogation of the responsibility she has  to the product  and to its reception   2019   I wanted the women to fight smarter not harder. I always wanted to find advantages for them  in being a woman  so obviously  underestimating them is a huge advantage to them. also  when they come into a room  they re trying to avoid fighting. unlike in male action movies  when they come in  guns blazing  there are no guns blazing in this movie. thats not how women operate. typically  when a gun s involved  youre gonna get shot. its very basic training that you want to disarm people  as much as possible. https   collider.com elizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-interview
drew lucy and cameron s version of charlie s angels was fantastic  I loved it and its one of my top movies... the remake was just God awful  with so much man hate it was nauseating... however no film yet comes  close to ghostbusters 2016... the entire run time was woman shouting  I hate men  at the audience  and I went in to that neutral  hoping it would be good... just horrible.
shes angling for a new movie  thast why this has happened  nothing else.
God no! I like deadpool just the way he is - swearing and all.
zack wrote the plot. allan heinberg wrote the script. snyder also did the screenplay.ww84 is patty wrote the plot  geoff john wrote the script and screenplay
10 58 why hire the most beautiful women in the world and flatter them in makeup and style  to avoid the  male gaze    why not hire unattractive women if not being appealing on the eye is their agenda
it will never happen  but I would love to see the response if some commando remake came out and the director went out there and started saying saying stuff like  no girls allowed. this movie isn t for you. stay home and reread twilight or something.
I hate the sentiment  you dont know the experience of x group so you shouldn t even write one!  the irony is that in these awful extreme feminist movies  just about all the men are stupid  stereotypically rude as hell to the point where its comical  chauvanistic and misogynistic as hell or all of the above and more. and its such a caricature with no depth  just the idea of what all men are from feminists.
she cant help herself. even in her awkward attempt at sidestepping the issue and rewriting the narrative  she makes the mission impossible comment. if she had directed the mission impossible series  she d be in the same boat complaining how women aren t allowed to carry a movie because she would have made ethan hunt an ineffective simp crybaby loser agent to a totally awesome mary sue you go girl female power puff agent and nobody would ve seen it. nobody sees your movies banks oh I dont know  it couldn t be because youre a bad director ! ms.banks. ironically named celebrity because her movies dont make bank.
good point - as even the action movies filled with a female cast only end up getting a larger male audience!   hahaha
80s and the 90s made strong female characters and we didn t have to see them be mary sues or  my personal favorite  the strongest character in the room because the script demands them too and makes every other character mostly male  weak dumb and arrogant. in the 80s and 90s we had strong characters who went against strong villains and fought their own personal demons  overall the goal for the hero was to overcome their demons and ultimately over power the villain. nowadays females are strong and males are weak. females can somehow fight 80 men without breaking a sweat and a man cant manage to touch the female. making movies bad to me.
she knows all to well why charlize angels did shit  but she cant come right out and say it or she ll loose that female armour. the problem now is the woke got so bad just a hint of it and men check out. so if anything its created a hurdle for women in the future a hurdle that never was there before.
iirc birds of prey had like one brief quip about black mask being a misogynist weirdo and somehow it got labeled as some man-hating woke manifesto by people that have never even seen it. it was a pretty good movie  especially by dceu standards.
wonder woman 1 is in example of making a female lead and not dumbing down the men. sure  she s the powerhouse  but that no mans land scene is exactly how you make a woman lead movie feel empowered without treating the men like worthless shit. she takes the initiative to save lives  the men follow her to help her. they take a group photo. the entire movie  while she is surrounded by men  there is this interesting thing called  respect . thats all these movies need. you dont need to push men down to bring women up. fantastic movie  until you get to the typical cgI end battle both dc and marvel are known for. wish they would cut back on that. wonder woman 2 is...I cant. that was garbage. while I enjoyed birds of prey it is very much a women vs men movie. also I hate that cassandra cain because a child whose entire plot is to shit out a diamond. the cast was great  the story far much less so  still enjoyable but Imean the w vs m is just not helpful. nor is there a need for it. I was there for harley and the bop  regardless if fighting a female villain or male villain.the thing is  as a male  Im not afraid of strong female characters nor leads. it isn t something that bothers me. how they are written is what matters. take rey from the new star wars sequels. while I liked her character they could have developed her a bitslower...and maybe even tried to develop poe and finn but this is specific to rey. I remember kathleen kennedy using the same  men dont like strong females  and we are like  uh  padme  uh leia. uh  ahsoka  Imean those are at least 3 female characters that are amazing characters that happen to be female. those are also 3 strong females that dont treat men like crap nor are they treated like crap by men. weird!!!
at the end of the day you are investing your time and money to watch these films.so itshould be worthy of my time and money.
11 39 the real world  maybe hollywood needs a reality check on this one. if movies were realistic most action movies would be over in 10 minutes tops! . I was watching paddington 2 last night  anyone wanna bet that if we made that realistic how unentertaining it d be but hollywood wants to talk realism in films where it doesnt belong!  I say if your going with that mind set you go all in and stick to realism if your going to use that as a way to defend an action movie! I remember when the most recent power ranger movie came out and I was critical of the costumes and some moron replied  the costumes are supposed to be more realistic!  and I was like  realistic  then why are they different colours!  thats not realistic   realism is fine if the movie is in a genre thatsupports it but action movies ! those things are probably the most absurd films in creation I d even go as far as to say in some ways they re more unrealistic than films like shrek  101 dalmatians or spirited away!  and they have the cheek to argue realism  pull the other one.
facts
ghostbusters 2016 was directed by a man... and it dealt with the same shit. this has nothing to do with whom the project heads are  but rather the compromising made in a film in order to fit a narrative.Ive said it before and I ll say it again  the problem with modern media  movies  games  books  whatever   especially in terms of remakes  is that the writers  producers  and directors are able to half-ass the story they re making by marketing it as a  woke  project.
I dont subscribe to the idea that all movies are meant to be escapism. there are many that use a narrative as a vehicle to confront specific real world issues and convey a message  or at least invites people to think differently. when done well  through clever dialogue  imagery  subtext and so on  this can be a powerful tool and can elevate a film into a masterpiece.hollywood of late unfortunately lack the skill and experience to do this. they attempt to circumvent risk  and actual talent  by bolting this messaging onto franchises with a built in audience and use their form of evangelism to guilt an audience into appreciation. they constantly hamstring their own messages by forcing them in this manner as it feels cheap  disingenuous  and frankly without sufficient thought or effort. if they cant be bothered to put real work into their ideological platforming  why do they expect anyone to take them seriously
wow its almost like its makes too much sense
a woman was the creator of my favorite action franchise of all time  uncharted  not the garbage movie  over 10 years ago and she was eventually kicked out of naughty dog for not being woke enough and destroying the main character the way 4 set out to. my point is the only thing stopping women from being successful  is themselves and all this woke ideology nonsense.
3 women lead by a guy named charlie     reminds me of charles manson and the 3 women that went on a killing rampage
do women really believe they could be a better lead  than tom cruise in mission impossible   doing the same stunts as he does   I dont think so .
did none of these people making crazy  not for men  feminist movies not watch anything the last 30 years  the best example I canthink of out of many is a movie called   the long kiss goodnight  starred geena davis and samuel l. jackson. basically jason bourne  but if he was a soccer mom. she s more badass than samuel l. jackson in it! it wasn t treated like some girl power men are weak bs. it was just a fun action movie. dont think it was a huge movie or anything  but itsticks out to me for being what I love. an action movie with some comedy. make a good movie  advertise it as such and let itspeak for itself. do they know their movie is bad so they have to push a narrative to make money
is that a cutout of hawkeye in the background
actually dc fans hate that movie too because1  birds of prey is not the main character  harley quinn is2  swap race huntress and black canary. huntress supposed to be half latina  half black. not black canary3  cassandra in comic originally is assassin and daughter of shiva but they changed her origin  even director s cathy yan want her to be assassin but wb forbid her with an excuse  Christina hudson script already greenlit4  they contradict suicide squad ending5  renee montoya is supposed to be late 20 s not late 50 s6  victor zsaazs should be main focus while black mask as final boss. sadly victor zsaazs is just there.
Im a woman who watched an action movie- dont remember which one. I laughed at some of the action scenes. I went with a group and someone asked me why I was laughing. I said the scenes were so unrealistic  they were funny.
@may loo  if it was kingsman it doesnt count thats supposed to unrealistic  but otherwise yeah.
if you want to be taken seriously as a female director  crapping out a turd full of identity politics and then throwing a tantrum when people dont like it  is probably not the way to go.
it ll make me watch your movie...  nah  just fvcking with you  no it wont.
every time I see these people whine about  men not seeing movies made by women  Im reminded of the skit from bill burr about the wnba. how  unfair it is that the wnba isn t as big as the nba.  there are more than enough women out there to make any form of entertainment aimed to entertain women a success. yet women aren t doing it. why  personally  I think its because not many people like to be pandered and lectured to. nobody likes to see the oppression or humiliation of a section of humanity.
in my book you  melonie mac  can get away with anything. youre drop dead gorgeous in my eyes and to get a negative reaction from me the only thing you could do is go full tard and start pushing woke nonsense. aside from that I cant think of anything.
waiting on marvel to figure this out.
the people in hollywood say that pro-woke bullshit like the charlies angel s remake  reflect the real world ....I highly doubt that. in reality it reflects their world  not the real world. in the real world  a woman wouldn t be able to beat the asses of men twice their size and three times their weight  especially doing it effortlessly  with the only excuse being  they trained their whole lives to do this . all the training in the world wont change your actual  biologically physical limits.there s a reason why there are weight classes in the mma  boxing  and basically any physical combat-like sport  and its not because its common knowledge that the guy that weighs less would whop the bigger guy s ass.
Im shocked! shocked  I say!...well  not thatshocked.
watch the opening for the original charlie s angels  and it was  screw the patriarchy. charlie s gonna give these female cops the chance to be badass detectives. . merit based badassery. empowering message  right  the reboot movies made it fun with positive girl power vibes. but nooo  the female gaze is what woke sjweirdos took away from them. merit is not allowed. femininity is not allowed. only the message is allowed.
melanie go boom! right on the money. thank you for speaking truth to... uh whatever ms. banks is. I like her acting and was looking forward to her charlie s angels movie until I started hearing all the antImale rhetoric. why support someone who is bashing people like me
90 lb girls beating up 5 200 lb bad guys in one fight tends to turn people off who like something close to realism
while not action movies  mary lambert directed pet semetary  1989   pet semetary 2 and several episodes of doctor who.  and zhao directed the eternals  featured both men and women. there s also   according to modern standards   two women who directed the matrix series.
she wanted to direct mission impossible. what s her directing resume thatshe should get to direct one of the biggest franchises ever  I only know her as a supporting actress. imagine playing the victim as an actress who got to direct a big movie  because it wasn t a bigger one.
because when women do things in hollywood it becomes this story. well  it wouldn t be if you didn t make it one  elizabeth. there are plenty of female directors who just go out and direct movies. they dont flaunt their gender  proclaim  this movie is directed by a woman  and I bet all you men have a problem with that!  just direct the movie  and let the movie stand on its own merit. if its a good movie  you ll do well. if you make the marketing about how youre a female director  and therefore people need to see it or they  re sexist  well  you ll lose people. not just men  you ll lose female audiences too. same way if someone says  see my movie about gay cowboys eating pudding or youre a homophobe . just make quality work. thats all that people want.
I was able to direct an action movie  frankly  because itstarred women and Im a female director  and that is the confine right now in hollywood. Imean  the irony and falsity here is palpable.a. calling action movies starring and directed by women a  confine  set by hollywood is actually a self-own. thatstatement directly implies that action movies directed by women and starring women are inferior  because why else would hollywood use that as a confine if it wasn t viewed as a punishment  you also have to remember that this is her perspective  indicating she d rather direct mission impossible  but got stuck with this gendered movie instead...so who is the biased one she basically says  I got stuck directing this inferior action franchise starring women because I didn t get hired for the better  non-gendered action films. her statement is so perfectly the wrong thing to say  it feels like a trap she s purposefully set for herself by admitting she  a woman  was hired to direct an action film. a film thatshould be seen as equally cool as any other film  and judged only on its merits. however   she believes charlie s angels to be a compromise handed to her by the eponymous hollywood and by default could not compete with the likes of other  non-gendered franchises.from my view  if dont get hired for mission impossible  which is overrated anyway  then make a charlie s angel movie that rivals it on quality  and build a franchise into recognition based on its merits alone  and prove that it doesnt matter who you are  you can make good art regardless.b. she s saying women dont direct action films  or dont get hired for them. except thats factually wrong  because she was hired to make an action movie. its not my fault she thinks all-women action films are a separate category punishment. also  chloe zhao just directed eternals for marvel. and there are dozens of examples of women directing action films. or starring in them.kathryn bigelow won best picture best director for hurt locker 14 years ago. Im glad that was the first movie on the list because when I read the quotes I about fell out of my chair. she s also ignoring the vast mountains of television that are directed by women  we re talking thousands of shows  episodes  etc. its pure neuroticism and self-orientated thinking  aimed at deflecting criticism for what could possibly be a bad film regardless of the sex gender of the people who made it.her point about marketing is valid  but she negates that anyway by again implying that it couldn t have done as well as other franchises anyway  because its a confine handed to her  not a liberating moment for women s cinema.
on the topic of indI comics  Im trying to produce a comic about aline strippers  space pirates. is there a market
I honestly didn t even know this movie was released until I saw it playing in a theater when I was there to see a different movie. I went to the bathroom and it was playing in the theater right next to it. I looked over and went   huh   thats how much promotion this movie got. you cant tell me the studio didn t know it was garbage.and its funny how you were talking about wonder woman not being a sexist man-hating thing when thats exactly what the second one was. first one was excellent  second one was trash. thats the difference between a man writing the movie and a woman. I own the first one  I wont bother buying or watching the second one again.
anyone remember point break  directed by kathryn bigelow thirty years ago
I feel a tiny bitsorry for elizabeth banks.  just a tiny bit.  she s made her bad choices.  truth be told  she still has enough time  beauty  skill  charm  and clout to re-establish herself as a hollywood powerhouse.  but thats if she s willing to face reality and choose accordingly.  the problem is her own choice to fully embrace the dogma thats been circling around  western culture.  it has several labels -  woke    social justice    socialism    activism    down with the patriarchy    anti-alt-right  -- whatever. far and away  its all the same. you know the expression how someone drank a cup of the kool-aid   elizabeth banks chugged down a two-liter of  the kool-aid.  somewhere in the not-too-distant past  she grew angry of her choices  and she feels she  sold out to men.   maybe she did. maybe she didn t. the fact is one way or another  she did haul herself up the proverbial ladder.  ultimately  she did succeed. and now she s choosing to blow it.now she wants to burn down the ladder  and punish  all those who did her wrong.  ... sigh. ... ms. banks  speaking from personal experience  yes people can do you wrong. when they do  make sure you confirm who exactly did you wrong  and only target them. lashing out at others who weren t even bystanders makes you even worse than the ones who chose to use you. thats been a real problem of today.  punishment by proxy.   instead of lashing out at the actual people who are the villains  you target someone convenient and gullible enough to be your whipping-toy. you get the sick satisfaction of tearing someone down and the sensation of  righteous vindication.  just -- you know -- dont think about the fact that youre helping to perpetuate the cycle of bitterness and retaliation. to quote an insightful  perpetually drunken critic   naaaah! it ll be fiiiiiine! as for ms. banks  she s in a prison of her own mind and her own bitterness. it doesnt take much research to find out she did proport that her  charlies angels  was a  feminist milestone.   its not hard to find the meme of actual news headlines -- from the same source  no less -- where in november they vehemently declare   straight white men!  charlie s angels isn t for  you !  and then in december   omg!  why aren t straight white men watching charlie s angels!  its failing because of them!   I wish I could post the links myself  including an interview from  variety  where banks said she wanted to make it clear her  charlie s angels  was to put men in the place and this was for women and only women.  its our time now!  still  anyone reading this has been pointed where to go. its not that hard to find right now.personally  I think the epitome of all of this is the scene toward the end where the  angels   oh-so-cleverly  reverse the poison  killing all but three or four men  and then gleefully dance on the bodies of the dead.  you had twenty-plus women dancing this poplock number all  all in-synch  relishing their vitriol and the death of men which they caused.  we re supposed to think these women just naturally knew this dance  and it was in celebration  not in contempt. please.oh  and ms. banks wanted to make us think that her  charlie s angels  was  more grounded in reality.  either way  thatscene simply solidifies the deep-rooted venom as well as the hypocrisy of the situation.  seriously  if  all men are always so evil   how did you get that many men willing to  die  on screen and stay there while nearly two-dozen women danced on their bodies. makes ya think  doesnt it.
the fact is women didn t want to see the charlie s angels movie either. they took everything that made the previous versions work and tossed it out the window. a big part of the audience for the marvel movies with male leads are women. just like the nfl or nba. more women go to those games then the wnba or any women s sports for that matter. women like watching strong males in action since before the original ancient olympics and the gladiators. there is a reason big muscular men are on romance novels for women its what they buy and want. wonder woman was good because it appeals to any gender. its the heroes journey. becoming the best you can be and fighting evil  concepts as old as time itself. you want a broad audience appeal to everyone.
ironically  youre talking about wanting to look at attractive people while I was thinking how attractive you are. talk about timing.
wait what. ww second movie she s hating men   . I dont see that though  can you explain why you said that
this  male gaze  crap is becoming increasingly insufferable. what does it even mean  if we look at the stuff the harridans accuse of pandering to the male gaze  it is stuff women also find attractive.  male gaze  is bs term for  conventionally attractive  wrapped in academic jargon to obfuscate just how trite it is to complain about it. if the term were limited to stuff intended to give normal men erections immediately  there might be a point  but since everything draws the  male gaze  it means nothing. incidentally  what does not attract the male gaze by either definition are high fashion model body types - either the  tastefully emaciated  or the  lots to love  version. I will  concede  however  that given the fact thatso many of them work in the industry  the high fashion aesthetic does indeed attract the male gays.
hating on your target audience doesnt make them want to see you   gasp  the more you know...
notice that movies   shows directed   written by hardcore leftists tend to fail badly  but yet they keep getting hired constantly.proving that its not about making a profit  its about pushing the leftist marxist ideology. and on a side note  you would not believe how many times I get responses to various movies   shows that I call  woke  and so many people stubbornly refuse to see woke. they are constantly arguing with me. for example  I say that the new rings of power show is  woke   and I get all kinds of responses denying that its woke and demanding I provide evidence. I try pointing out what is woke and they just refuse to see it. the same for she hulk.
the male audience  generally  does not care if the star is a woman or if the director is a woman. we dont even care what the movie is about half the time -- plot  what plot  what we do care about is  not being preached to by feminazis  being patronized  being criticized  being told that we are the problem  I still dont understand how wheel of time is still making another season . we just want entertainment. I love action  sure but I ll watch a sappy chick flick with my wife as long as it doesnt have a woke subtext.
women can like sexy women in movies the same way guys like watching schwarzenegger and hugh jackman movies.
I watched the first 10 minutes or so of charlie s angels. imo  it was a really boring intro. it begins with generic cityscape shots - probably done by a second location team. then itspends about 2 minutes on close-ups of kristen stewart  accompanied by very boring dialogue with a man who is given a generic rich-guy stereotype to portray. kristen stewart s dialogue is focused on her doing things by choice  and thatshe - as a woman - has so much potential. it is obviously a social  message  disguised as dialogue. if done in a smart or interesting way  it would be fine. instead  it was simply bad writing. when the fighting begins it is so bland  and it is so obvious that the women are kick-ass types who are not going to lose  that makes the fight dull to watch. there is no tension  no sense that they might not win against the  men   and  there is nothing  real about how they fight. the dialogue - once again - is just bad. these are not characters that I wanted to watch for another 90 minutes  so I didn t watch any further.
right on !
you know Im not so sure charlie s angles was ever a good franchise perhaps we owe mrs.banks for opening our eyes to it.
imagine making movie so bad that people will rather spend hours on youtube watching most random stuff instead of watching your movie.woke have terrible issue with bringing real world problems into movies  movies  etc to kill escapism. in their small minds they somehow think that if they destroy escapism  people will start caring about their issues. I have great metaphor on how that isn t how it works. imagine you have a kid and you want the kid to clean their room. kid ignores it as it doesnt see the problem. so you start taking away its toys so it does what you say. now  will the kid rather see your point or consider you a bad guy and throw a fit directed at you  woke are just kids so they dont understand adult world  lot of memes about adulting are kind of proof of that . they start to learn about money recently as companies are less and less keen to bank roll their endeavours at killing franchises that cost millions to acquire.
my takeaway from that top 10  women in hollywood   kathryn bigelow and a bunch of  was there toos .
same goes for the alphebet community hating on straight people. you will gain enemies as long as your mouth is running  especially when trying to appeal for acceptance  or tolerance. thatshit dont work for children when they do it to their parents. so its beyond me why coddled brats who are supposed to be mature  in women s case based on science  more mature   think they can do as children  and not expect backlash from mature adults. most movies starring women suck. considering in most roles  even the strong woman roles are they objectified. women are okay doing this with men  in movies  sports  musicians  even if the dude in real life is a misogynistic pig in reality  they still will swoon over the pig bastard. here s the hint  that doesnt work the same with mature males  only dogs and pigs  who love all women for what they can get out of them  but care less about them. another hint  men dont care anymore  even men that are taken and loyal get harassed by these ignorant  single  modern women. guess what you can state your case  but you cant force men to listen or care. hollywood can have their trash  and eat it too  male  female makes no difference.
its really not rocket science  but hollywood still doesnt understand.
interesting click bait title. well done!....as a follow up question  does making movies that  hate  or objectify  exploit or demean women also guarantee viewership  that would sometimes at least seem to be the case. since we already have seen such movies actually succeed with men. as a woman it must make you glad that tradition continues  but it is interesting to observe a woman more outraged by  movies that hate men.  good to see that you are making sure that does not get too lopsided in favour of women...haha...bravo! once again  well done melonie.  man hating movies  far exceed movies with females cast in hateful  exploitive and demeaning roles. glad to see that you are nipping this in the bud before it gets out of control...haha..
another newsflash  hating on white people wont make them watch your movie either. and we wont rush in to prove we re not racist by paying to see your movie either. Imean  here s the deal  Im a white woman who loves scI fI  fantasy  horror and superhero genres but  for some reasons  completely unknown to humanity but clearly visible in the statistics  those genres are most appealing to the demographic of white men. now I understand white men became a minority in america and you want to assimilate new audiences for the future of your business  but white men are still - the holders of most money in america-  let s face it... most prone to stupidy buy your shI y merch and toys and sh    because - again  statistically - most of the rest of us are not going to spend a dime on toys  shirts and other sh  unless we re buying it for the kidssee  its not in any way smart to alienate them while trying to appeal to others.and Im talking about america because you dont care about the rest of us. if you did  you d understand your only other market is europe  also predominantly populated by an audience of... white men  and the next best is australia  where again  surprisingly  your audience are mostly white men.
I could never enjoy star wars because Im not a blue eyed  blonde american living on a farm. just cant connect with characters who aren t exactly like me. if characters are too different from me  I dont like them and I cant relate to them. they have dared to stray from the perfection that is me - these writers  probably.
avoid the male gaze! well they succeeded
wow you are so pretty without make up. holy God  seriously
those girls dont measure up to farrah fawcett  jaclyn smith    kate jackson
certainly took elizabeth banks a long time to figure out a better way to do things.
all this is very odd considering the metrics of the time said it was mostly men who went and saw it.
@ucoidxa3j_ceqnv23je7dg4q thank you  truly ! I haven t had any interest in video games since I was given a nintendo system and played the s  t out of some version of super mario in the early 90 s when I was 19 or 20. thanks again but please give it to someone who in to gaming. I d rather have a really good grilled cheese and bacon sandwich  .
you should watch the 70s series. it was a lot of fun to watch.
@may loo  if I come across it on a streaming service I ll give er a try.
talking about minority....Im brown men  my country got immigrant just like us and europe do and right now among them  they try to abolished our rights. dont think its white men problem only  it happened all over the world
Im shooketh
but charlie s angels is the female version of mission impossible or is it just me to thinks that
Im flabbergasted
hahaha youtube is actually advertising the movie on this video! lmao
I am shocked. shocked! well not thatshocked.
they need to stop hating on men cause a lot of men are aweeeeeeeesooooome. also  they cantotally make female characters in movies super attractive without revealing a lot of flesh. just dont make them so butch.
the movie is pretty good
it didn t help that the action in the trailers looked crap in a film that was being marketed as an action movie.
we already have strong  gorgeous women who kick butt. they appear on simpcast.
melonie is .
love your content  less air quotes pls
its funny that hollywood think that the issue is the  male gaze . we just want good story telling and action action action. romance movies have more naked people which target the female audience more than most action movies.
you should just watch the critical drinker s review instead. he ll tell you all you need to know  so you dont have to suffer  if you dont want to. I didn t see it either  because Im just a disgusting sigma male.  d
I ll quote comedian bill burr   this is your bs. its not my job. why do you keep dragging us  men  into this
oh man! no way! who would have thought ! ! !  crickets
she literally said  this is not for men.shoutout to gal gadot  wonder woman is for boys and girls.
yup to late we all be watching bollywood movies soon xd
good stories with good acting that das not useless bash men will wokr better.
breaking news  water is wet
the idea of charlie s angels is just james bond in reverse  women want to be them  men want to be with them.
rofl I love it
why the hell is noah centineo in that movie
point break top 3 films all timmeeeeeeee
imagine a director just admitting their movie wasn t very good.
wtf is with all the misandry  like hollywood always has been  but these days its like they re tripling down and going hard on it.
lol the way I see it the mistake was that they took a franchise that was originally aimed mostly at male consumers and just stopped catering said demographic
yeah if you look at the women from the original tv series even the movies they were very very beautiful very feminine they didn t act like Im 800 lb gorilla I passed you but they kicked butt again they re just trying to change the entire dynamic sorry they re not trying they are we on the right are a dying breed
mcu memo  breaking news  hating on men wont make them watch your movie....
lighting makeup got you looking she-casper today
other than melanie mac and a handful of other women  the rest never take responsibility for their actions.
nice
if all the women who went to  50 shades of grey  went to see  charlie s angels   it would have been a hit  regardless of how many men went to see it. do men bemoan the fact that not enough women go to see horror war films
imagine telling people your film isn t made for them then complaining when they dont see it. she s complaining about marketing as though she wasn t the one that was saying thatshit. I cant imagine the lack of self awareness it takes to do that.I also dont understand the logic of not making them sexy. when you look at porn statistics  lesbian  is one of the highest search results among female consumers so clearly women like to look at attractive women too.
imma make a movie where only paraplegics can go see itso they can stand togetherooffff cancelled
maybe elizabeth banks it was because the 2000 movie was fun  campy and wasn t afraid to have strong cool sexy feminine heroes. it made fun of itself and didn t have social commentary about feminism every five seconds. oh and attacking men didn t make them go see your movie wow that revelation made my head go boom!
there s a huge disconnect between hollywood and the potential viewing public. woke product s simply doesnt play with main street  bigolefact
thatsweater is pretty cool
she s just trying to throw someone else under the bus rather than accept responsibility for a shitty script and horrible directing.it wasn t just the marketing. the script was horrible. it had a girl power we hate men vibe to it. it permeated the entire project and thats why it failed. which is the same reason why the ghostbusters female reboot failed.
and as for the comics people thinking that comic books and comic book movies are out you know everybody s getting tired of them well ripple versus prove thats not the case we re just tired of the type that they re making and what sad is they brought deadpool and wolverine together and there is a good chance they re going to kill that too
hollywood woke shills   we need movies and stories to reflect reality hollywood woke movies   110 lb female lead punches 6 5  260 lb jacked man through a wall
women believe men dont have feelings and emotions to
I lost my summer tan and am a little ghostly at the moment to be fair lol. my skin tone  changes by like 4 shades depending on the time of year lol!
@melonie mac go boom  a b l oom for each season  Im here for it.but mostly  Christmas presents.

your natural eyes are nice.
director  actress and producer of her own mess.
how old is that movie got to be at least 3 years old already and she still whining about that. I feel sorry for whoever angers this woman she s got a long memory.
wait there was another charlies angels movie
insert shocked pikachu here
they are trying to throw marketing under the bus lol no thanks elizabeth banks they can kick rocks tom cruise and chris pratt have my trust
wow  man in that movie are evil  maybe they hate man like me  I love it  I gonna watch that movie
this beyond hating men. this is simply sexism
seems patty jenkins has her finger on the pulse
I think shes more in denial or she knows and is dishonest
your hair is fucking amazing. just had to say
suspension of disbelief  which is what entertainment media like this is supposed to have  shouldn t  reflect the real world . if it did  there d be that much less disbelief to suspend.
see  its jealousy
thanks!
leftists    what  stop hating men  are you crazy     that is exactly how they will take this concept.
hating on men wont make them watch your movie ! who d a thunk it !
everyone wants to feel attractive till someome they dont find attractive is attracted to them  women especially they want that attention till someone they dont like starts giving them that attention then they act like  how dare that person  its all a fucking game
elisabeth banks told men to not watch charlie s angels and men  listened now she saids they dont want to watch the movie. double standards and msm killed the franchise. aaaaaaaaaahh haaaaaa.
I really wanted to like wonder woman  but I just didn t. maybe I should give it another try.
2019
thank you!!!  d
@melonie mac go boom  you should read the Lord of the rings
Ive been saying that for decades  of course Im a man so nobody cared.
what movie  I dont even remember this movie.
henry cavill and the marvel chrises etc see to be fine with their objectacation
they ve lived in an echo chamber for so long they listen only to themselves.
woman moment
elizabeth banks doesnt seem to realize that women dont like her woke charlie s angels reboot either but no in her eyes its men s fault
queen.
me at 14 00  ayyyyyyy!  d
I think suckerpunch was a pretty dope movie
Im a man and I saw this in theaters and it was bad the only bright spot was kristen stewart who was fantastic
boom. boom boom. boom.  commander susan ivanova
death proof is a good movie hating on a man.
@melonie mac go boom  question left of screen  that a halo weapon  the purple thins against the wall in front of the desk.
you got bamboozled mel  just check the interview of that director when the movie was released  she was the one pushing hard that feminist bullshit. dont let her rewrite history and pretend it was the marketing team that fucked the movie over.
different promotion would not have made the film any better.
who doesnt like to see attractive people kicking butt  jealous people.
go boom!
the women who do things are usually in a relationship with a male partner who takes the lead and any male who takes the lead wont be watching this. as per the other ones they dont do anything. this is probably why they re not happy and if they do something its usually not in the right direction like this movie director.
lol she ain t even all that anyway!!
it is  thats why feminist hates that movie.
yes  the needler
you know I dont think that they re going to change back I dont think that they re going to see the error of their ways I think they re pushing the long game because then about 5 years maybe sooner the majority of people that go watch movies will be these toxic masculine hating just people that are exactly who they want because thats what s being produced into these colleges and at school so its going to change the entire dynamic of movies I think we are at the end of the age where movies are good and they re just going to turn into these watered down stupid stupid things
if she genuinely thinks she can only direct as a woman if  the lead is female she should have made a good movie that would make people ask for more.
the reason she s not directing an action movie like mI is because she s not a good action director.
let s check the news articles  shall we 1.   straight white males  this movie is not for you!  - 11 9 20192.   why are straight white males refusing to see this movie   - 12 16 2019wow  that only took 5 weeks!
@melonie mac go boom
girls almost never take the blame it takes 2 to get pregnant any yet its always the man s fault for example.
the worst part of what elizabeth banks has done she has caused immeasurable harm to the next women in that industry
how bad was the new charlie s angels  its best summed up like this- they wasted sir patrick stewart.
and water is wet. wow...
instead of saying the marketing was bad  how about saying the movie was bad. tara banks would of got more respect for that  then trying to blame everything else to make herself look better.
basically  victimhood is big business nowadays  but personal responsibility isn t.
punisher war zone was directed by a women  damn..
chicks didn t wanna see it either!  nobody did.
japan is laughing at us over there
so her own comments about it being feminist at the time of release wasn t her own thoughts but that of the marketing team  hmmm chinny reckon
I think of a man  then remove all accountability and reason...... yeah.
I hated the hurt locker...
who would ve thought right  hating on your audience will make you fail  Imean that totally worked for g4tv
first charley s angles was always a guy movie

joss whedon created buffy the vampire slayer.  he may be a douchebag  but he created one of the best female action heroes ever!  I d say she is up there with ellen ripley from alien.  I always try to think about is it good   thats all I care about.  why are people trying to complicate things  just enjoy it or dont.  everyone is a victim blah blah blah  everyone has gone through things  Im a white man so Im supposed to be ashamed of shit that was going on generations before I was born.  I always try to think about the micheal jackson song  man in the mirror   be the change you want to see in the world  dont tell everyone else they need to change if youre not willing to change yourself.  sorry about that y all  peace and love y all
maybe she should have made a good movie. then it would not matter so much it was not marketed properly.
the hawaiian shirt makes me think Im watching magnum pms. i.
its kind of annoying that all the new movies and shows have this rhetoric. its really off putting and a dont see hollywood cleaning up there act anytime soon.
didnt this film come out years ago
they complain about how women are objectified in movies  yet thor has no clothes at all
Im not against female leads  directors and all that but the usual and beat to death  men are trash  naratives is odd can imagine these types will be slient on the day looking out for us guys for once with data to show things we face but many conflecting things of  man up  to many also cry for us to  show emotion main reason I stick to anime is the stories are better sad people who some how get involed localizing anime try to spin and sneek woke things but still anime rains supreme Ive not care for western media in ages but when I check something from itsagundam or melonie s channel I get easy reasons why to not care of these laughing stocks of modern media!
I was told not to watch it. so I thoroughly enjoyed not watching it.
I wonder how an action movie with attractive men with the promo saying women this movie is for men dont watch this action packed bro movie jajajajaaj and then blame women if it fails
dear elizabeth banks  go watch all of kathryn bigelow s films. take lots of notes.
hollywood will get women writers and directors on projects with a female lead but have no interest in the themes.  thats why you see what is going on with she hulk  they all admitted they have no clue about comedy  or the law.
wow... this is getting ridiculous
dont remember the reboot attempt at all
I watched it  its a lot worse than it looks.
you are one based whamen. I like
courts laws
the women in charlie s angels looked drab. people want glamour  wonder  beauty  magic  fun and an escape from reality in film.
thats charlie s angels  more like charlie s prats.
for all the people who want equal rights  for all the people fighting amongst themselves and arguing  for all the people who tell the stories of accomplishments and how they are better. I have one question.who the fuck asked
12 13 whoooot  almost 100k vs 100 ratio  women are kind of rare these days... xd xd
it was only 3 years ago
@giant hand  why are we talking about it again now
@dna seb  3 years ago isn t a lot of years ago.
did you even watch the movie  even charlie turning into bad white male and replaced by white woman at the end of movie
@bobo boy  no. Ive read the review. still charlie s prats.
its crazy that a man cant simply reference statistics and probably without being labeled sexist. but women can do it all day long. its not fair. fun fact  auto correct didn t recognize the word sexist when I typed it. lol
gotta wonder why if she was trying to  avoid the male gaze  she didn t find three ugly chicks to fill these roles  there are definitely less attractive actresses who could have done the job just as well and since they were apparently not trying to use their looks that would have worked out right  I didn t see the movie so I dont know if that premise works the whole time
so now we can say both genders can be sexist and not just man. yha she sounds like those types of women where she has to be right even when she knows she s in the wrong
shrugs.....okay......
here is a good idea  write a good script and stop checking boxes.  when all the woke boxes are checked first and the last box that get checked is a script  you are not doing it right.
most movie tickets are paid by men  whether they are going with buddies  family or their so.  you will always see more groups of buddies going to see a movie than you will see groups of girl friends.  even the chick movies rely on men s wallets because a dude will take his gf or another girl  so he can get sometin  sometin  later.this is what the women in entertainment industry do not want to recognise  and continue keep shitting on men.  they just whine whine and play victim instead of accepting that they are just being shitty at their job and their actions and character.
but what about chad  lol.
and u might get guys with there girlfriends too
hahahahahahahhahahahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaahahahhahahahahaahaha  10
if its a good movie  guys will watch it. take wonder woman for example  it did pretty damn good at the box office   822 million just in the usa   and it had a female lead and a female director. they need to stop crying about their crappy movies.
charlie s should have never got a remake
how to make a product or service than nobody wants to buy.
see those women she picked to star in it and they have no  no muscles but they re in a fighting pose  get a woman that are actually physically strong then maybe.
lol.... im like...oh really! lol...too funny  like what planet are these ppl currently living in shite ing on  lol
its no one but her own fault. she instigated the whole thing herself. before anything even happened  she accused men of misogyny.
they say men dont like seeing women in major roles but when do go see movies with women in a major role its because she s hot and we are sexualizing her. so they make the women look frumpy so they dont get sexualized and then bash men in the marketing only to claim we didn t go because they didn t make the women sexy enough. why would we go to a movie that is bashing us  there s a lot of predicting how we will behave and why and a lot of self fulling those prophecies to support the narrative. meanwhile  investors lose money.
holy shit a cute girl thats actually smart and based and not hating on white men ! is this a miracle
I was doesnt this property took cruise owns... but he wont let me because Im a woman
I dont know bout you  but I enjoyed the rebooted lara croft and love the redesign as I find the new lara beautiful. that being said  I just hate the 3rd tomb raider. she is just being annoying and selfish. lol
this woman has put herself into a grave and made her career tank  if she had just admitted she was wrong the first time  it wouldn t have flopped hard! the movie failed for multiple reasons  but you wont say any of those reasons at all!
mel those girls with stylized to be back house brawlers straight power lesbians lol
they told me to believe all women. then they told me their movies weren t for men. so  I believed all women and didn t watch the movie.
youre speaking in generalities and thats triggering
wonder woman was written by a guy and it happened to be zac snyder
original charlie from his angels is not far from being pimp  . dont think itshows women off well
the cast wasn t particularly strong  either
janebond
if women loved the movie it would have been a huge success regardless of what men thought. but go back and watch the 2000 charlies angels movies they killed it in all aspects  writing  acting  music  plot etc  whereas the recent movie was so dull in all aspects. so imo it didnt do well because itsimply stunk not because they shit on men.
the 90s charlie angels where bad movies. but love by fans because you see they try to entertain and have good time. they try to make the audience  have fun.
eric fucking july beinglibertarian
who gives a shit who directs a movie as long as they re a competent director and know how to make a good movie!
the 3 of the standing there in fighting pose    lol.  find 3 random 14 year old boys and its all over.  hell 3  12 year old boys could handle them.
she didnt really do a good job with any of it....the casting especially she should of had kat dennings playing one thats for sure lol
dont like it dont watch it bigots! .why isnt anyone watching it! !
check out - the ninja knight. he covers the woke agenda stuff well in his vids
and what s crazy if you look at the numbers when they try to adapt to the real world the real world doesnt look the way they think it does or the way they want to believe it does thats why these things fail the bulk of us in this country and all across this globe are not that way and if they stop bringing it up and bashing people in the head with it most of us wouldn t even care that its in the shows or its in the movies and its causing animosity because how many people probably looked at that movie and decided Im not going to go watch it because you know its going to be man bad woman awesome saying that we are horrible people because we re guys and it may have not even been that kind of movie but because of this narrative that is being pushed throughout this country its causing a lot of it to pop up we dont want to watch listen or deal with that as you said its about escapism
I like your brain
wasn t just men that didn t bother with this movie. lots of women didn t bother too.
they just dont get it
dear elizabeth banks  as a man we still wont watch your movie... that is all...
I am a guy and I happen to love pitch perfect 2. but I hate her take on charlie s angels  which is so cringey and a bad action film.and I love the previous charlie s angels because even though it was also non believable  its massively fun!
if they want to set the target for powerful women in movies especially strong women  wonder woman is the standard.
its the same with g4 hating on men guess what it wont make us want to watch your movie
why couldn t she do it under a pseudonym  writers have done it for hundreds of years. she could have dont it that way  the regular person doesnt care who the director is. her ego is only inflated by the peer group. if it was good  people may have looked into who did it.
oh dodging accountability  wow would never expected a women to do that  rolls eyes
Im just letting you know I hate you guys so give me money
was it any good
I have two words for the reason I watched the previous ca movies before this hot mess. lucy liu. there was nothing that remotely drew me to this movie  especially after the rants again men. not for me  okay  wallet closed.
tomb raider movies  2000s charlie s angels movies  resident evil movies  old guard  atomic blonde  mad max fury road etc. yes men must definitely hate movies with female action stars...
money s tight for a lot of people. youre going to have to do better than discriminate against half the populace to get money from them. same with race changing people  prey showed you can make a story about people while keeping them as theyre meant to be  lookin at you little mermaid  meant to be danish in origin .
too bad  liz banks was very funny in the show  scrubs .
yes
isom!!!
let s face it no one dislikes feminists more than other woman.  women dont support other women look at the numbers from wnba  lpga and woman s tennis and most of the fans are men.  follow the money  look at the kardashians and how much all the products associated with them make.  how about taylor swift look at her tickets sales mostly to woman and girls.  the money shows what women do care about and what women dont care about.
men want a good movie if is great drama action love romance all the better .....but stop making woke bs we dont want crammed down our throats period end of story.
ww84
its not just the marketing that was stupid   its the movie itself   its garbage   the earlier movie makes no other effort than to be fun funny and silly   banks self pity seems to be a play to direct the next mission impossible movie by playing on woke guilt   she will probably succeed at that and make a garbage movie
she made a shit movie with bad optics. then went on to crap on dudes. the charlies angels movies were fun and playful and playfully teased us all with the male and female dynamic.  that made it fun.  flip your gd hair   that was funny.
they need to quit acting like I have a responsibility to go see their crappy movies.
a  disconnect   no ms banks  it was your outright misandry that wrecked your film at the box office. please learn your lesson.
xd
there s no regret  all she s doing is damage control.  she ll do the exact same thing on her next project  only there ll be more male bashing
..melody looks like a woman today..unlike hollywood
you would think its common sense
I just wont watch lunatics we have them more ilr why would I watch them on tv too
what about aliens termanitor
anyone remember the 355
straight white man here  I love female led movies  but I wait to watch until I read their twitter comments
look what happened to antman and wasp or black widow they swapped change characters the star wars created a mary sue ruined the genre to the point where we re not getting a moving the next I dont know when is the next movie coming out I heard they re trying to move away from the political b      thats a good thing though charlie s angels full throttle is one of the still the best movie that they did they cut points out the film that was a little too brutal you have to find them on the internet and they thought they was going to touch full throttle with this think again there s no wokeness in film nothing was forced
so you insult someone and expect them to pay for your product  how dumb does she think men are
men dont want to watch wnba not wnba movies shows. give men what the want. men action movies. check in with the top gun maverick team in which the main hero is shockingly the main hero and not a ridiculed mentor for the next insert female super feeeman.
thats you women s go to isn t it
she should regret directing that pile of trash  instead.
we are tired of these garbage films. we want movies to be fun and entertaining. not a painful experience
if the trailers fail you... word of mouth will pick you back up with people defending the film. guess what happened to this film.
this gaslighting is annoying she be like  hollywood is like hard  when she herself was in the very pr of the movie.
look  I admit it  donald trump told me not to go see the movie  okay
analytics
the problem is wokeness...they dont make movies that captures an audience interest from start to finish ..just look at she hulk.. total dumpster fire...she a out of touch character.. she great for what able to control her anger because she gets cat calls on the street everyday.. she better then bruce banner s hulk in everyway because she a woman..I rather watch black widow..serena from underworld.ripley from aliens..resident evil..those are the great movies with powerful female actors..the difference is very far apart..
terminator  underworld  alien  all had lead female roles and they didn t bash men. just make a good movie show
ya lashing out at potential customers and especially your target audience is terrible business
men need to start treating women the way women treat men currently..things need to change
it doesnt matter if youre a man or a woman  if the movie is  the movies
sup she-dunk
elizabeth banks   ...pass.
do you have a twitch
as for the bull of   I could direct an action movie starring women because im a woman   completely ignoring the first ever female director to win an oscar was for an action movie the hurt locker  or one of the biggest blockbusters ever was directed by a woman   the matrix.
boom
so.......men cant direct a film with a female lead when the characters of charlie s angels were created by a man. namely aaron spelling. um.......what
banks is lying imho. it wasn t just the marketing. the movie  was fully feminist and the stars said they tried to avert the make gaze.
I never saw it
its like feminist hollywood doesnt believe men aren t perceptive and their just dumb and spoiler alert men are much more receptive than we let on and we can play these games too.
if mr.h is correct it was men who turned up for this film.
she targetted the movie twords women... women didn t go see it.  for some strange reason its men s fault.  the level of lack of self awareness is astounding.
whoever she be  she ran a shitshow  made a shit  show  it failed  then she blamed the paying customer who she attacked. I cant see why the movie failed.
she should just stick to modern family
no shit really  pikachu face!!
agree! at some point  financial realities will penetrate the bubble. orange man bad  white man bad  masculine man bad  straight person bad  Christian person bad  feminine woman bad  fit woman bad...can only go so far. until then  I ll stick with the old stuff
more like trying to invent the idea instead of giving the audience any real credit.
yes  link in my link tree in description  d
wait... wait... wait...I liked charlie s angels in 2000 and 2003 but I was told time and time again that as a male I should not watch this new 2019 movie because it is not made for men and we as males are just toxic and evil so I never watched it.
yellow
did these geniuses ever think what it would be like if we flipped the genders here and made a  man only  movie that puts women down as dumb sexual objects to be used by men. boy that one would not go  but hating on men and then being surprised men dont watch that content is next level stupid.
primarily  men usually only went to  chic-flicks  because they were dating or married to a woman that wanted to see said movie. now that 1  taking a woman to the movies has been blasted by woman as lazy  2  women have become more  selective   meaning less dating is actually happening  3  the films are explicitly promoted as  not for men   it is absolutely no surprise thatsingle cis-men have zero fucks to give about a movie not marketed for them! probably why the vast majority of men dont buy makeup. its not marketed for us. mostly  if men did buy makeup  we would turn it into war paint. surprisingly  when you tell men its not for them  they listen and just move on with their lives. we built a lot of shit in 10 000 years. we have other stuff to do that is made for us. women want to take over comics  fine. men did it when it wasn t cool. video games  same. we got blasted by people calling us losers for spending so much time playing. no matter what women  take over  that was predominently male focused  women will have to truly understand one very key thing  by they re walking into a house we built and staking claim. and thats fine. we ll just build some new shit. we dont have the issue of being wholy unoriginal.
please all women need to watch stargate sg1 and stargate atlantis so they can finally see how a female characters is proprly written  female can be both femenine and and a badass
its a writing  directing  acting  and marketing failure.
lmbo
saw your videos recently  why do youremind of a voice actress. mean no insult
I wonder if she turned  charlie  into a female or ignored the fact that the angels work for a man
feminists cut off their nose to spite their faces. brilliant marketing!!
Im a female director  lets be real. no  you are not! your a actress that decided she wanted to direct a action movie. you didn t get picked to direct a mission impossible movie is because your not a well know director. your trying to live off your actress name. a company is not going to give you a million dollar budget to a unproven director.
they try to make the women men. making a woman more masculine does not make the woman appear stronger. look at alien or terminator. strong women who had feelings and fears and rose to the occasion to fight and succeed.
you make too much sense  I worry that the small portion of the population that cannot handle common sense will come and cancel you.
wonder woman was a feminist moviethere is a scene even saying men are needed for reproduction not pleasurebut the movie was also goodthats why it was successful
sorry babydoll she didnt get that memo...said demographic...
I stopped watching remakes  that nobody asked for   a long time ago.
im a male and my favourite movie is probably the matrix  Im who directed that  the wachowskis.just much a great movie  leave your shitty woke crap at home  get it in your head  it makes no money  look at rings of power  utter shit.great video btw
I like that youre not showing your mid-driff in this video. as a man its very distracting to me.
melonie mac are u sure ur not at least a little bit bi
okokokok  if there were no straight whyte men you would all still be calling science... magic
did you watch the movie  that men you just said turning bad in the movie and another female replace that men at the end of movie
@bobo boy  go find an adult.
she s honestly full of it  gay men watched tf out of the pitch perfect movies  rebel wilson is a queen ngl.
not correct  hating on men will not make them see your movie
and op is right... women have more leeway in almost every aspect of life...if ya dont believe me... let a woman slap you in public... then slap a woman in public...I guarantee the reaction you get to each scenario will be infinitely different.
afaik first harry potter was made by woman.their pride is finally bearing fruit. hubris is always punished  sometimes after a long time .
novel concept but one can make a movie about women empowerment without making men look like complete shit.
so she is upset she can direct a big money movie bc she is a women  and it has nothing to do with her movies bomb....
men write better women than women. men write them as strong  confident and self aware  women write women as irritating and narcissistic.
I find it very odd... there are so many studies showing that men and women both prefer looking at beautiful women.. is completely ignored.for that matter... how about the bI and lesbian gazes  oops  open mouth and insert foot all of a sudden.
go back and watch die hard. yes  it had a strong male action hero  but his wife was a badass too. no  she wasn t doing roundhouse kicks to terrorist faces  but female strength doesnt have to look like male strength.
amazing bash your target audience and they wont watch your show or movie that is revolutionary
is banks gunning for directing a mission impossible movie    I sure hope for their sake they never hire her as a diversity hire.
ya but she s a millionaire and youre not
I am so sorry  I am trying to listen  but my brain is exploding  what the fuck   no  not the abbreviation  but the full expletive explosion...charlie s angels was already strong feminist cops!!! wtf have they done to good female role models that fought for their abilities to be taken seriously    omfg...
@melonie mac go boomwatch the trans files.banks is a male.
no she doesnt have a point.....ida lapone was directing action movies back in the 1950 s
hawaiian shirt on a woman.
did all this victimhood happen when penny marshall directed   I never cared if it was a woman- I just loved penny s films... because they were good!
make a movie that is not for the male audience.  cool!  do not be surprised when men dont go see it.  we men  do listen.  you thought that women were gonna show up to see it....huh....did nt ya.... but guess what....they did not do it!  why   because action movies are mainly supported by men!  there are movies without agenda that men will see.  but its about the writing  sex appeal and most of all.....the writing!  I love a character that kicks ass that happens to be female!  its not that complicated.  too many of these hollyweird types are caught up in we we have to represent the underepresented.  forgetting that the only people that asked for that....dont even go see your shit!  they werre just virtue signaling.
charlie s angels was impowering. this current one is not.  just more of the same woke insanity.
I dont think that was the issue with charlie s angels. that movie had just bad and amateurish writing and cinematography.
disagree though  plenty of books have great female writer. sadly they were ignored in hollywood
someone who tells the truth thank you....charlie s angels was just a God awful film I got through half of it....birds of play was really bad as well and had blantent man hating in the film...men get nailed for writing two dimensional women in film when woman do it no backlash...not fair....campy is not sexiest
why does everything have to be woke these days  this is just getting pathetic.
better marketing wouldn t have changed the fact that the movie was terrible.
let s keep it in the relative real here. they re not hot. female side characters in mission impossible would ve been better cast choices for the angels.
a gay white man  wrote the script for charlie s angels
point of this is woke no one wants woke in there entertainment and that movie is woke get woke go broke it really is thatsimple
I was surprised a woman made that american psycho movie. I have never seen such violence against women but a woman made it.
what the hellare they wearing looks awfulwtf
I didn t think the movie was that bad but  the pr behind it made people not want to go see it. some of my favorite hero s are women. only the most hateful men are going to not watch a movie just because it has a female lead.
everyone I heard talk about this movie said three things. the black chick is great. the movie was okay. elizabeth banks  attitude is terrible.
buh when women do things in hollywood it becomes this thingand who benefits more from that
charlie s angels reboot deserves to flop  big time
I see your point but please do not forget that the script for charlies angels was a steaming pile of garbage.  give us a decent story and we might watch.
lmao  make the next mission impossible movie  have they not seen what tom cruise does in his movies   tom doesnt bash is audience 1  tom doesnt make woke feminist garbage 2  and 3  tom cruise does his own insane stunts. good luck.
its reverse as well woman do not know how to write a man and vise versa   takes two to tango.thats why every man is like ricepaper. sigh...
they handed elizabeth banks the ball and she clearly had no idea what to do with it.  whining about being a female in hollywood is not going to change the fact thatshe directed a crap action movie.  I hope she enjoyed her short time in the big-time director s chair.  back to disney teen junk films for you.  uh  bye-bye.
telling men they are misogynists  horrible human beings and they dont deserve respect doesnt endear men to spend their hard earned money on your crappy movie.
a person killing a person is ok tv. an alien killing people  thats a movie. people watch things like action  fantasy  adventure  supernatural  whatever  to escape reality  its mostly men because our reality is constantly being vilified for being born with a dingdong. its hell. let me ask you  as women  how many times has someone offered to walk you home  now the men  same question. chances are men dont have nearly as many  if any  cases. thats because society says men should be chivalrous and protect women  but also that men are strong  and so will be fine  and dont need help. the same society trains men to be cold unfeeling laborers and to work till they die. and all they ever really want is someone to just see them  as they truly are  as a person  someone to spend their lives with and give everything  yet  at least these days  all women want is a guy who s 6 feet tall and pulling a 5 to 6 figure income. this too is created by society. entitlement. privilege. sexism. women s razors are made with larger grips for finer control  they re colored  and they have razors with shea butter and cocoa oil in the razor. women s razors cost  on average   2 more than generic men s razors. there s nothing stopping a woman from buying the cheaper less attractive razor  yet women would rather complain about the cost of customization. a man works stocking boxes while a woman works a cash register  yet she demands to be paid the same as her make coworker  even though she is not  in fact  working the same job as him. our society was built by men to protect women  and has inherently caused entitlement and privilege  which isn t inherently bad  but that entitlement and privilege has led to someone much worse. misandry is so common these days  would itshock you to know that 60  of rape accusations are found to be false  another 30  are unsubstantiated  and therefore could not be pursued further. to put it another way  4 in 5 men know someone who has been falsely accused.
I refuse to watch anything that has stewart in it.
the movie wasn t even good. the original two were way better
wonder woman worked because it followed the first premise of heroes.   just be badass   nobody cares about your race  gender or sexuality if youre a badass.  whining about your plight as a person of a paricular demographic distinction. is not badass.  wonder woman was badass.  period.  everyone respects badass.
ngl  but the alvin and the chipmunks charlie s angels  titled alvin s angels was better
wonder woman proves you dont have to have woke narratives and misandry feminist garbage to make a good female lead movie.
I think people need to search imdb before marketing a film based upon feminist talking points.
just gives us men more reason to not want to watch this movie. Im going back to the last two  you know  the ones with cameran diaz  lucy liu  and drew berrymore  where this feminism bullshit didn t exist during a simple time.
naaa I wouldnt watch it . nooooo one who makes any art should seperate the demo. just be quiet and say no comment
oh let just forget the stories that had a female lead that are considered great for the sake of whining about some alleged persecution women experience. funny how no matter how obviously in the wrong a woman is  she is always gonna imply that if she was a man  the thing she is doing would magically be considered perfectly acceptable. fact is that no matter how many of your moral principles u have managed to checkbox  if people aren t buying your stuff  people aren t buying your stuff.
even before banks decided to go off on her anti-male tirade I was not going to see this movie simply because it has the worst actress in the history of hollywood. kirsten stewart is so bad she makes megan fox look like an oscar winning actress.
Im sorry  who created sarah connor  who created lara croft  who created wonder woman  who created ellen ripley  who created princess leia  who created the bride  a man  another man  another man  and another man  that man  and oh yeah another man. youre complaining about your movies not doing well because you ignore the source material and expect the fan base to respect your adaptation even though they re the soul reason that intellectual property is even a topic of discussion. you want to project your own ideological beliefs onto these characters  and you want this character to represent you. if you aren t aiming for legendary status youre going to be on a list of least memorable directors of all time - and that list gender neutral.
I am a girl and I still wont watch this garbage show.
what action movie  you call that atrocious  horrible movie a action movie
wonder woman was written by a man then directed by a woman thats why I succeeded. wonder woman 2  failed because it was written by a woman and directed by the same woman. it  hated men and it wasn t based on any source material. it lacked growth and development. ghostbusters 2016  charlie s angels  birds of prey  renamed   and many more movies and tv shows in the last 8-9 years were a as no still are marketing towards women and bash men. so when the movie tv show is bombing they attack men for not watching  paying money for it.
shocking blokes tune out inane bullshit... who d have thought it
nothing wrong with making an angry feminist action movie  but you should probably temper your expectations as most men wont see it  most women wont see it  and anyone that doesnt like action movies wont see it  so youre left with a pretty small percentage of the population and people that will just go see anything to get out of the house.
I bet rippa comic is awful...
are you saying that elizabeth banks had a brain fart moment dont you just love celebrities and their self flagellation.
this is no different than bros alienating the straight people from their movie... then pretending homophobia was why the crappy movie tanked.
why are people always attacking the male gays
wonder woman wasnt  woke  did really well. ww2 was  woke  asf and turned out like shit
the trailer did nothing for me. looked like hot garbage. I honestly liked the lucy liu  drew barrymore  and cameron diaz one. the 1st one anyway. good movie!
mail gays the gays thatstill use snail mail
I feel sorry for all those men who enjoy these films. its clear they ve lost all trace of masculinity and have become  beta males.
Im a guy and the best dc movie is the first wonder woman movie Ive watched it at least ten times. the worst dc movie is the second wonder woman movie absolute trash.
here is the failing of directors making action movies with leading women. men dont by it. it is just too fake for us. include more women using subterfuge  and their feminine wiles  rather than showing a 5 foot  105 pound female kicking the butt of men the size of nfl linemen. it just not add up for us. failing to do this makes female directors feel like wnba coaches. yawn.
didn t the 2 charlie s angels movie in the 2000 s do great  I like them... so its not that the movie was a female cast. so what is this lady bitching about. if this movie was made with the intention of man hating  what did she expect
the remake of point break was trash
Im so sick of hollywierd toxic feminist.
its just more nonsense.  on one hand  I have accept the idea that men and women are equal  while on the other hand celebrate when a woman accomplishes something men have historically done. why would I celebrate something someone else has already done   in the real world  I know some women can do what men do  we dont objectify them or even give them a hard time for doing the job. the issue coming from hollywood is that they see things from the hollywood perspective  which tells me the issue isnt the real world  but in hollywood. as it has always been. when they are preaching on their award shows  they are preaching about their world   and the false world of movies  tv and scripts .
this movie was awful. all the guys in this movie are terrible human beings except for one. and you guessed it  its the homosexual friend.
women  especially a liberal woman  wants equality and what not then throws a fit when they make a film thatsucked
its like the nazis making an anti-jew movie expecting to be a blockbuster in jerusalem.
charlies angels the reboot  was a shit movie that nobody wanted.it was only made worse by the misandric marketing.but it would have flopped  regardless of which  message  it tried to convey.simply because it was shit.plain and simple.
looks like catering a whole movie to a minority of bitter misandrist women is not the right choice to make money hehehe. no shit  sherlock  Im shocked how film producers can make such stupid dumb choices nowadays
