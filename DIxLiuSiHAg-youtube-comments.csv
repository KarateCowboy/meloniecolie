personally Im hoping this could mean we ll see another entry in deus ex  legacy of kain  or thief. lara croft I hope gets something new as well  but with more similarity with the original games.
we are in the time of destroying franchises  while squire enix did some changes to the lara croft s character and the tomb raider s series that I found irritating  nothing cantell us that the next brand will respects the source material  and they could do even worst to lara. we have to just have hope
the further tomb raider is away from square enix and its ethics department  the better. plus  legacy of kain. holy...
hopefully jeff ross does good by the fans on tomb raider. he did great with days gone. so let s hope he and his team can deliver. I want him to revive legacy of kain also. he could pull it off after his years working at sony bend even making uncharted golden abyss for ps vita.   but yeah! these studios and all the ip being owned by embracer group is a good thing from what Ive seen of how embracer handle their studios and their remasters  remakes and new ip so far. their double aa games from thq nordic have been pretty decent and their triple a studios have also delivered good games through deep silver. Im just really hoping legacy of kain comes back in some form. hey! even gex can come back now.
let s hope this will result in some good in these ips  they deserve so much love with the right passionate teams and studios
congrats on the new pc melanie! how awesome!  it ll be interesting to see where tomb raider goes from here. hopefully a new developer can bring it back to its roots and listen to the fans  also thanks for being respectful to all your viewers  Im not Christian but I always like your verse of the day segment anyway because you dont force things on us just open up our ears and hearts and I can always take something positive away from it.
it always bog me why so few people bother about the fact that tomb raider were sold to a japanese company  especially british people  lara croft is the most iconic fictional british characters  she will eventually get the same status as doctor who  harry potter and sherlock. I love crystal dynamic s works  but I hope a british studio will get their hands on tomb raider game in the future.
melonie  if you ever wanted tr remasters  this is excellent news. embracer is known for remastering games.
buying a new pc is like moving to a new home  its new and fresh  but you ve gotta unpack all your junk to make it feel like home again
I  d love a return to classic lara   but Im not gonna lie Im equally excited for a potential return to the deus ex franchise.
Ive heard that embracer group is well known for making remasters of games  so we can expect a remastered classic tomb raider collection if they do end up buying crystal dynamics. I also hope they make a remaster of angel of darkness  include all the cut content and fix the issues it had and if the remaster does well then make a sequel  which it was originally going to get if I remember correctly. I agree with square enix selling off those studios and ips because they have not been doing well for them for a long while  so this is a good move  that being said  square enix could have gotten a lot more money than 300 million  so it was not a completely good move as a result.
just the thought of things moving on for the legacy of kain series is good enough of a reason !learned with this news thatseveral content creators I follow here actually love the series  but it had been shelved for so long that most didn t spoke about it  except the data miners and afficionados who kept uncovering cut content within the games  decades later !
damn cant say I expected that. what does that mean for the new game that is in development I wander. hopefully more focus on actual tomb raiding and not so much on combat  which was pretty much the only issue I had with the reboot series  everything else was fine but it was way too much combat and not enough exploring and tomb raiding. on the other side  I do hope this means a return of one of my favorite series  legacy of kain  I would personally like if thq nordic took on that task as they already successfully revived a number of old   dead   ip s
I love deus ex games. I thought human revolution was probably the best one  and was pretty good as a prequel to the original deus ex which was made by a different developer. I dont know how it ll keep the same feel at a new company  but I hope they keep making them.
im just hoping that it gets handled to a right studio that will give lara crofts franchise justice and feel like an awesome game.
chatter Ive heard says that future tomb raiders will be made on smaller budgets due to embracer group being known more for their aa game development model so in turn requiring cd to get creative againand not rely on the aaa eye candy to mask their by the numbers game design like they could with the massive budgets square provided them with.
it is not our place to judge others  period. well said melonie.
I knew you couldn t resist this one melonie!
the one part everyone is failing to mention is that  as part of the deal  they are also taking on square enix s debt as part of closing the deal.
we dont need next-gen storytelling  whatever that means   we need next-gen gameplay. least as far as tr is concerned. some franchises should be kept simple. kinda like hitman..
wow legacy of kain  haven t heard that name mentioned in yeeeears! same here
there already is new tomb raider in the works  there has been a whole slew of games announced to be working with the new unreal 5 engine like the witcher  gears of war  tomb raider and fortnite for whatever reason.
oh God yes but too bad for kain they had a mmo that failed
@warren perkins  if u mean nosgoth it wasnt an mmo  it was an arena battler
I kind of doubt it  honestly square enix wasn t really the problem. they didn t replace the devs. unless the new publisher fires the development teams then I wouldn t expect anything different from these games.
@wakaI ryu  you may be right. for now we can only wait and see.
yea as far as thief 2014 that game was ok hopefully the next company will make thief the way it was suppose to be between thief gold and thief 2 the metal age and make it exactly like that and hire stephen russell to do garrett s voicr character.
and hopefully another deus ex.
to my mind  no they coulden t. I had already written off tomb raider completely  to me it was already destroyed and I wanted nothing further to do with it.so from my perspective  either they will rescue tomb radier  or it will just remain dead  those are the only two outcomes I can see happening here. but atleast now  there is a glimmer of hope  a chance that we might get lara back. there was no such hope under square  they were going to continue down the path of turning lara into nathan drake  in both bodyshape and gameplay .
@grobut81  well said and totally agree  but that last part about se making lara into nathan is not thanks to se  but crystal dynamics. they are the ones not wanting to go back classic style  shorts  lara being a kickass lady etc. so thank them.
yes !
changes to lara s design didnt come from se s ethics department  it came from crystal dynamics themselves  sadly.
@charming peasant  thank God someone else knows this aswell.
legacy of kain needs to have top notch writing or else it ll just be another shit generic open world game
@anti-bs  from what I saw of dead sun s they could just salvage that game. rework it and replace the main character with raziel and you ve got a open world soul reaver game. the stuff I did see though outside of what was shown. shows it was set after defiance or during one of the timelines raziel and kain created  and raziel and kain were going to be in it. you d come across them at some point. embracer group do own dead sun s now. so ya never know
jeff ross isnt the shot caller on tomb raider  dallas dickinson is  who Ive heard is a fan of the original tr games.let s hope that love translates into what tr will become in the future.
@charming peasant  jeff ross is design director. he did make a uncharted game for vita so perfect pick for a new tomb raider game. dallas dickinson is an executive producer of the series. so who s to know how much say he has over this new tomb raider.
I didnt mind it was sold to a japanese company  but I understand the brits took issue with it. my issue is   always has been that they changed lara croft tomb raider to please third wave feminist. who used   abused the franchise to force themselves into the gaming space  needless to say I consider the crystal dyamics reboots and rebooted movies to be abominations of the highest order.
@afca nsf  and here s the thing  Im not even british  but I just feel so sorry for lara  she is one of the best thing came out of england and her own people didn t even care. to be fair I wouldn t consider crystal dynamic s tomb raider to be woke or aligned with the third wave feminist  not entirely at least  I never felt like being talked down or literatured in the story  Im glad this inexperience version of lara croft exist so the sweeter it will be when we see the classic lara croft return  and one day we will miss this version of lara as well.
wrong. uncharted is more popular.
@hmamsb  I know playstation are big in the uk  but uncharted is not made by british people.
@commando 385  ok true.... its still not a very popular franchise it was a popular franchise   and I dont think it will survive. it does have its hard-core fan base  but other than that its not like mainstream. uncharted is mainstream now. the uncharted movie had a low critic score  but the public loved it. idk if its because lara croft is a women and movies with a female protagonist do shitsales wise  but it is definitely not going to be close to  something like harry potter. the last doctor who had a female protagonist  and look what happened to that franchise... went to shit.
tomb raider trilogy remaster
tomb raider aniversary  tomb raider legend and tomb raider underworld did get remasters of sorts for ps3 if your after a decent remaster of those 3 games. has all the dlc included also I believe.
maybe they can hire the dude that did the tr remake as a side job
a classic game when crystal dynamics is on board  they are the ones that hate everything about the classics
@mrsinteroirflip  hence why I said embracer group  not crystal  although embracer group could force them to make them and if they did then that would be hilarious.
crystal dynamics are still developing the next game tho btw...
@1chasg  the next what  the next tomb raider game  I thought they were making a netflix movie or something.
@zeros origin  yes the next game. they are the studio that development the last 3 games also.
this is why itseems cheap  guessing the real cost is that debt.
totally agree. as a veteran of the hitman franchise  I was able to embrace the newer versions as what they added to the originals feels natural and doesnt inhibit the game flow at all. instead it expands on its core concepts.
yes it is a good thing. you should check out razorfists video about the sale. the pc will takes weeks for it to feel almost the exact same.is there any reason why you didn t just swap in your old drive and put in new drivers
embracer loves to do remakes of old games and stays faithful to the source material cuz they were the ones behind the fantastic spongebob battle for bikinI bottom rehydrated remake when they were still known as thq nordic and this team behind the new tomb raider game for unreal engine 5 seems to really appreciate the classics so let s hope that we get our old lara croft back.
this means that embracer owns the ip s now so they can get some of their other studios  230  that they own to do a iteration if there is a studio within them that wants and have some good ideas.
one thing about embracer group is they own thq nordic who basically is a remaster and remake publisher with all the older games and frachises they revive so hopefully this could mean classic tomb raider games could be remastered or updated for new audiences.
I heard the news earlier and knew exactly what your video would be about.  was not disappointed.
well considering how square enix fumbled or ignored most of those franchises for the most part  I feel this is more of a rescue operation  hopefully this will result in revivals of these franchises  soul reaver legacy of kain or thief  in the form of remakes remasters and if successful maybe sequels. I d absolutely pay for a thief remake of the original game or thief 2 with modern graphics and little changes to the gameplay ... just imagine how amazing a remake of the first thief game would be in unreal engine 5.
lara is moving out of the square house. I really hope we can see her make a proper come back to her origins now.
outside of final fantasy 14  square has been completely clueless  especially the last few years.the fact that deus ex is finally free made my day!
hey melonie I love your content so much! you have such an amazing head on your shoulders.   I thought I should let you know however  that kotaku has been found to publish loads of faulse information. just be careful
laura croft tomb raider-talk starts around 1 32
this happened to io interactive when they were dropped by square enix because of hitman absolution s sales. people from io termed it as  squexit  at that time. good thing io already publish their own stuff now the hitman franchise and its doing well.
when I heard the news yesterday for a minute I was hopeful we could get our beloved lara croft tomb raider back  but when embracer started to praise the reboots  that hope was flushed down the drain immediately. like many im more optimisic for deus x  though I got to be honest  considering its part of the cyberpunk genre  I dont know if its the right time right now for a deus x sequal. considering gaming sadly is still firmly in the grip of that fundamentalist ideology. the price is a steal  and shows how badly square managed them and especially lara croft tomb raider which of course was more than just the video games. which they effectively killed with the reboots.
got my fingers crossed that embracer will  ahem  embrace crystal dynamics  earlier properties  meaning older tomb raider games remade  as well as a revisit to legacy of kain. they seem to be that way with thq nordic  but fingers crossed. also  dang  I need a meta pc. when will we get gameplay   d
wow  its not a new channel  finally  love the new intro. I think it is a good thing thatsquare enix sell legacy of kain  finally we might get a new kain or soul reaver game.
Im surprised elon musk didn t buy tomb raider! haha fyImelonie s hair always looks good!
would be nice to see tomb raider return to form. bad ass curvy lara raiding tombs and giving no f s
find the sale quite interesting since se acquired  eidos with the intention of competing with the likes of ea given the fact the japanese game industry is in decline.
I want a new legacy of kain and tomb raider 2 anniversary.
founding out mel is an infp just made her 100x cooler. nerdy introverts unite! lol I do find it cool though how in your videos you dont put off that vibe.
hImel. Ive changed operating systems many times  and I can confirm it is an all day project!
they re japanese studios are doing fine. all of ff is thriving atm with ff7 remake and ff16. and there starting to put out some of their smaller franchises like valkyrie chronicle  and also making promising looking spin offs like forspoken and some ff tactics games. and dragon quest is doing really well  even though itsounds like dq12 will take a long time.
@darkLord1061  kh4 too
@darkLord1061  itseems people completely ignore the japanese side of se which is crazy.
naw 7 remake was a success and majority liked it lol
@chris foy  yet tomb raider 2013  sells 16.5 million copies on half the budget  and square pull their face its called double standards  chris. square had a goldmine  and didn t know what to do with it. selling tomb raider for 300 million !   all to recoup your costs over those stupid marvel games  is one of the biggest missteps in gaming history.what a fail. you ll see. square are in serious trouble  if they dont buck up.
io does need someone to help with the budget though. hitman 3 was rough  and it didn t feel like a true sequel. I hope they get picked up by someone like sony or microsoft.
is it really in decline again
Im occasionally optimistic for this  in regards to tomb raider. ...but then I remember its crystal dynamics. I also say  occasionally optimistic  because I wonder how much input square enix might ve been giving them on the last trilogy.
personally  Im hoping for a legacy of kain reboot!
this news has come as a relief to me as it hopefully means the rebooted triology saga is officially behind us and will not be continued in any shape or form. I dont care if those games were objectively  good    they weren t tomb raider games to me  they had completely different identity
in response to @10 06 Jesus said  love the sinner  hate the sin . you never said anything promoting the sin.  he who is without sin cast the first stone.  youre doing great  melonie! I cant wait for the next video!
I know nothing of this embracer group or their politics or intentions with either of these franchises  but the best thing I can suggest is to find their twitter feed or whichever social media platform they re on and using and politely suggest how not to f  k up your favorite franchises they have acquired.  do be specific in how you want them to not mess up your favorite games  because begging them to not f  k it up doesnt help them  because there are far too many ways to do that in many fans eyes  some ways are impossible to avoid  others can be done rather easily without knowing it  so do help them out in that regard
is it possible the old lara croft will come back now  how about remasters of the original tomb raider trilogy
the ideal studio to make a new tomb raider would be toys for bob imo.
I try very hard to stay out of alphabet people s business too. the problem is they wont let you stay out of it.
this is entirely a good thing.
this is good and bad.good because its a sign that the japanese are divesting themselves from the western gaming industry  meaning that it looks like its  ethics department  are not long for this world and now eidos can make what it wants without square enix giving marching orders.bad because at the end of the day eidos is a western aaa developer  that goes double considering that its based in montreal.  Im sure the staff over there resembles a starbucks during a may day rally.  if eidos wants to have a future they need to blow up the company  fire everyone  and hire actual game developers who have love passion and respect for eidos  ips instead of clout chasing craptivists who will just turn their ips into propaganda sludge.hell maybe eidos can stand to hire you as an image consultant for tomb raider or something of that nature because the western aaa gaming industry needs a swift kick in the ass yesterday.
thatsounds ridiculously cheap an acquisition. like you said considering the budget per game the ips alone should ve fetched far more. handled properly the tomb raider franchise alone can be worth over  1 billion.
speak it girl they definitely need somebody else to make tomb raider
seems like lara croft got herself a new boss.
the issue will be if it is woke. look at what crystal dynamics is doing to perfect dark
all fans of our beloved lara croft should collect digital signatures and send them to phill spencer to rescue and buy all the tomb raider studios with their ips.
this means essentially nothing  the ip is just switching its parent company  the studio over seeing the franchise  crystal  is primarily still in charge  this is basically just gonna be a different publisher  aka a brand name we see in the loading screen lol.
would be nice if now night dive studios managed to port remaster the og thief games for modern consoles as well as the deus ex games.
introverted doesnt always mean shy or withdrawn.
a return to classic with just more action  call of duty lara hasn t been the same.
so is itstill ross v dickenson for the next tr  with all the female protagonists we have now  aloy  ellie  jill  faith  kassandra...and on  seems like a good time for bad lara. that doesnt mean escape from butcher bay riddick level anti-hero  awesome btw  but she doesnt need to be a femshep either.
as long as the writing is top notch and its not woke
@anti-bs  hopefully it wont be  but considering embracer owns thqnordic and thqnordic is in charge of the  saints row  reboot  there s a good chance it will.
tomb raider anniversary is the single greatest  remaster  I have ever played. the only things they  added  were time trials and only 3  hidden  items per episode. neither of which affect the game play one bit  but instead give the player a reason to return to what is would be considered a short game by today s standards.
@terry landess  well  thats not really true. tra had significant level changes  modernized controls and physics  and a modified storyline.
@thom ervin  um  yeah   remaster  . . . . .
exactly.
embrace group has been releasing older titles. perhaps we get classic tomb raiders released in some capacity
the paltry sales price would indicate that none of the companies actually own the tomb raider ip  rather they work on each game under a licensing agreement.
1 25 lol  been sitting on a 2 tb nvme to install windows on  something I need to do  but I have been holding back for the last 4 months because oh how much of a nightmare the reseting up is going to be for me.
hopefully adam jensen s deus ex series will finally get the third game it deserves  one that will connect adam jensen s story to the first deus ex game . also  thief and tomb raider deserve reboots that are more faithful to the vision of their original designers.
this is gonna be interesting
the pricing is kinda weird its so cheap considering the huge titles they re selling... Imean shadow alone costs 135 million dollar to make.
I d sell my soul for a new legacy of kain game.
it cant get much worse  being said proceeds things getting worse.
I can see ubisoft doing something with tomb raider lol maybe like a open world can you imagine if rockstar games got ahold of tomb raider lol
its about damn time
its funny how every time the tomb raider ip changes hands we get a different timeline for lara and a different lara to boot  I dont expect this change anytime soon tho- core design era   classic series- crystal dymanics era   legends series- square enix era   survivor series - embracer era   unified timeline series or shameless hollow nostalgia baitseries
finally square enix sells tomb raider!!! I  ve hoped and waited so long for this to come true. they really killed tomb raider. but I think we have to wait for a long time until we get some new aaa tr game. I wish sony would ve bought tomb raider.  thank you  melonie for sharing your thoughts and being critical about this whole ... I dont know what this is... a mess!  you have all the thoughts about that new croft like I do! this is not lara croft! I will never accept what they ve have done to her and the direction they ve pushed tomb raider.
make tomb raider great again. the same goes with the  thief  series.
I honestly had to double take when I saw the sale price. I thought to myself... im shocked sony or ms didn t jump on this
starting a class action lawsuit against melanie. she must date us each  in turn! haha  but really youre a smart young woman  enjoy your content. I like the mega pc anti-cancel culture stance  great company!
embracer is not the type of gaming corporation that have much creative say. they give their studios a lot of freedom. if anything cd will have more freedom  but possibly less budget. we ll see.
I guess square didnt believe in the next tr story to commit to it. sad but its maybe for the better.
as a deus ex fan Im happy since the chances of getting another game went up dramatically. no more marvel slave mines for eidos montreal.
just so people know  the changes in lara croft s design is because of crystal dynamics not square enix.
Im hoping  sold to people who care about tomb raider and dont care about  the message  lol.
why is that funny  thats what happens when different people work on something  you get different results.
@hmamsb  most franchises do not reboot whenever a new rights holder comes along even if it might turn up a better result than to ruin what came before. had the fallout series rebooted  there might be quite as much resentment for bethesda games studio s entries in the franchise. star wars hardly could have been worse had disney just left the old series as its own thing while they did their own renditions of episodes 1-6.
uncharted is more popular than tomb raider... why do you think sony wants another game that is pretty much a copy of their game and worse sales wise  I know tomb raider was first  but uncharted pretty much innovated the genre... the devs who made the last 3 tomb raider games literally said they took a lot of inspiration from uncharted.
@hmamsb  I was thinking more of thief and legecy of kain ect
@nerds never sleep  those are cool ips  but let s be real  dead ips.
@hmamsb  only dead because se didn t do anything with them. they also get the avengers and guardians games and liscenses. how amazing would it have been for sony to give insomniac the avengers to put in their open world nyc  I just think of the possibilities. give santa monica a turn at legacy of kain.... omg
@nerds never sleep  Imean  yes a legacy of kain from santa monica could ve been cool... but its still a dead ip  and most of the fans are now old and dont have time to play games. I could see those games getting a remaster  but nothing more than that. btw santa monica studios is working on their next big new ip  its going to be a sci-fI semI open world game. they have been working on their sci-fI game for 10 years now  building the world and story... the games development began after gow 2018. how do I know this you say  there is literally concept work from them they released years ago. this is public knowledge and not a rumor.
@hmamsb  I know that  but I am saying this because embracer group isn t really one for putting much money into the games... I feel someone like sony would have taken these titles and ran. plus  adding these classic ps1 and 2 era games to their plus lineup would have been a great move
@nerds never sleep  well thats life  we dont get everything we want. I am also bummed.
I for one im happy the next tomb raider game will be multiplatform  where I do agree crystal take on tomb raider has been a mixed bag but regardless I still think embracer will be a fine publisher for tomb raider going forward and no more it didn t meet there expectations nonsense.
square s japanese bosses probably looked at the latest designs for lara croft and thought fuck this woke shit.
could really go for a remaster of the original deus ex  as long as they dont change anything in the story!!!
I generally dont care about these franchises  but Ive been fairly positive on squenix lately so Im looking at this like the japanese company excised their western connection. hopefully this would mean a more non-woke company  I doubt it   but unfortunately  lara will likely be like that weirdo last of us 2 character.
you could call whoever purchased these games the tomb raider raider.
Im looking forward for sniper elite 5 and other military shooters .
hey mel. you can put a tag on your videos with which verses you ve read on each so youremember  if youre worried you might repeat yourself
finally eidos is free from square enix
we hope the project of next tomb raider unreal engine 5 are not abandoned
waiting for the new movie. the last one wasn t woke. her stepmother was hella evil. hahaha!
why are they selling tomb raider shortly after they anounced they re working on a new tr game with unreal engine 5  I dont understand how these businesses work but itseems a bit weird to me that they have decided to start developing a game just to sell the franchise to someone else when they aren t even half way through development  are they even going to finish it . anyway  Im not getting my hopes up with the embracer group either  tired of getting my heart shattered to pieces.
I dont follow company moves closely but I think enix has been on a streak of woke-ish moves ever since they got an office over the west  was it on california  regardless  the one thing to care about is who s acquiring the games. people are used to say  this cant get worse   but the last 3-5 years have taught me it absolutely can
I am a isfp-t and I score about 90  introvert.
this is good  as now sony is more likely to acquire square enix. tomb raider and all those studios barely made any profits. square enix wasn t disappointed about the sales for no reason. if they continue with the same formula like the last tomb raider  I would say thats the end for tomb raider.
it wont stop the woke employees from making woke shit. nothing is going to change from a change of hands.
I really wanna play legacy of kain
good. maybe now someone will see fit to actually do something with the legacy of kain series instead of letting itsit dormant.
square enix dont make much money off their western studios so it makes sense.
well actions speak louder than buzzwords when it comes to a once-popular ip trading hands from one gaming entity to another  I still have a lot of reserves about another so-called  next gen tomb raider  as se distilled lara s character into a blubbering plastic reality tv personality for short profit gains over the original heroine who d laugh in the face of danger   just bring her duel sidearms to bare and blast thy fools ass into the next dimension in john woo fashion.
this is honestly horrible because they are trying to add in crypto  block chain and nft bullshit into these games. they said as much in an interview about their future plans.
and all of that will blow up in their faces when people choose to not engage in those games and avoid giving them any more money then they are willing to give i.e. the initial cost of buying the game
@creativewm_personal  Im honestly scared for the future of gaming. people said the same thing about microtransactions and now they are normalized. too many dumb people out there that will throw their money into it.
I wonder if embracer plans to let crystal continue the tr franchise  personally hoping for a new developer who has some creative integrity and true love for the classics .
a 100 million per game  how  did they have to make a new game engine or recode the entire thing and then hire specific extras for each person in the game with their own specific modeling  or was it like movies where what feels like 80  of it goes into the marketing
is there even one female breakfast cereal mascot
yes melody  tomb raider was better in the early and mid years before they turned it into a gritty cinematic reboot. the tonal shift was out of place and it felt a bit too much like a generic survival game meets movie game... like something ubisoft or sony would churn out. the classic puzzle platforming featured in the early years were classic and the set pieces and action were more entertaining  fun and enjoyable in the legends era  which mixed the scope of tomb raider with classic james bond.
just got a new pc my self.  drivers are a pain might have to just get a new mic rather then keep using the old one.  driver page is in chinese sad to say not fluent.
they sold hitman and io interactive and hitman is as good as its ever been  so hopefully its the same with tomb raider
its a neutral thing. I dont think the reboot trilogy has been a byproduct of crystals working under square enix.
tomb raider  2013   large budget  sells 14.5 million copies  horrible! these companies are a financial headache! sell them off for cheap now!kingdom hearts 3  massive budget  sells 5 million copies  disney! yay! let s make more! when you wish upon a star!
you cantake a snapshot of your old system and then transfer it to a new system. granted  you would need to reinstall most drivers  but modern windows version come with most basic drivers included and they would be installed in background  without user input.square enix has been producing nothing but shit in last few years. a common trait among developers publishers. instead of making good games  they produce  next-gen  shit  that is usually worse than something produced even 10 years ago in everything but physics and graphics that are usually related to game engines being used  rather than developer skill   while filled with progressive messaging and microtransactions up to wazoo. modern day gaming  specifically so-called aaa  is mostly associated with low quality  low effort  incompetence and maximum monetization.
hey melonie mac. Im not a tomb raider fan at all but this is for the better. stick to the heart of a series not only focus on making money.if you lose touch with fans you wont have a good reception.listen to what the fans want and embrace it to be loved
I dont think it ll change unless someone buys it outright like pull an elon. but Im glad embracer is dropping them because this ll force their hand to make a good game. no more financial windfalls from big daddy private equity funded corporation.
is this a good thing who knows only time will tell
good morning melonie. I just want to tell you that I am so sorry this is late but I just want to tell you that I think thatsquare enix selling tomb raider and other video games is a bad thing bc they have had their video games ever since the first tomb raider game came out in 1996 and other video games that they made and they kept the other video games going and they kept tomb raider game going too through 2017 or 2018 and so I just want to tell you that I think that it was a bad thing and idea for them to sale the tomb raider games and other games that the company has made over the past years  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to tell you that I am truly sorry for this being so late  ok melonie. anyway also I just want to tell you that I am so happy for you that you got your new meta pc system yesterday and I hope you have fun with your new pc and hope you take care of it and hope you dont destroy it and mess it up too  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home and hope you have a great day today at gym if you do go today but if not that I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home with your pets melonie.
seems they were sold for super cheap.
who bought  tomb raider   embraced group - huhwe ll see how things flesh out  so to speak.this company is a monster - they bought dark horse  3d realms and a bunch of other companies- wow - they re a swedish company so being that they re outside of the us and its woke culture- Im gettin a good vibe!I d love to see a duke nukem done right - shake it baby
Im with you melonie  regarding passing judgement on... I do my best to be a good Christian  definitely not perfect. but the best thing I can do about others forcing alphabet soup is ignore it. I do not care about your sexuality  I do care if youre a decent human.
she s no less a hero than indiana jones.
this isn t as bad as itsounds here. tomb raider was always best served as an independent franchise. not beholden to squreexix unrealistic expectations. squareexix will live   evenly die under final fantasy. which is fine by me as much as I love that franchise. it hasn t evolved if any over the years. although I did like the ff7 reboot. so I think this is actually good news here.
honestly with woke censorship of square games lately maybe this is a good thing
worth pointing out square enix lost  1.2b in market value  down from 6 to  4.8b  after embracer acquired eidos interactive corp arm along with their ips even including sleeping dogs from square enix since they only kept just cause  outriders and life is strange.square enix devalued eidos arm while embracer made a absolute steal of this deal.what does this means for square enix  nothing. they will continue to operate in japan as usual. sony is looking for somebody else to acquire and I dont want to speculate.
did they confirm the budgets for those games  Im guessing the profit margins were way different for those 2 franchises.
they made a kingdom hearts 3
@king_kovu  tomb raider was  100 million. kingdom hearts 3 took more than 6 years to make.
@backup368  so we dont have a budget on kh3... seems like we need more information before we make rash judgements. we also need the profit for each game.
@king_kovu  I cant imagine that its less than any of the tomb raider games.
still  kingdom hearts 3 has  statistically speaking  sold more copies per day in 3  going on 4  years  than tomb raider has done in 7.
honestly the fact they re a swedish company puts me at ease they wont end up selling to amazon  tencent  etc
cant say Im optimistic about this. if a woke company gets ahold of tomb raider and or legacy of kain   we can kiss our dreams of good old fun games goodbye. heck  maybe we should already stop having hope now.
pretty much the only person whose take I wanted on this.
omg....... tomb raider is doomed.... when I look up the games list from the embracer group  I cant see any games that are even near what a tomb raider game should look like.. seems like almost no experience at all in such type of aaa game... Im loosing hope..  why cant naughty dog just buy the rights for the tomb rider franchise  it would be so fucking epic....
I like  social-commentary channel  better than  new channel  in your introduction.
as a non Christian  the one thing that has always bothered me the most in Christianity is the  holier than thou  kinds of Christians. human nature is sin. sin is human nature. there is nothing more to it. if you believe in a God of forgiveness  then I feel like its safe to say that he is likely to forgive your transgressions as long as youre truly sorry and making an effort to more fit within the confines of what your God wants of his followers. just always be you  melonie. thats the strong young woman thatso many of us have come to love  and come back to.
11 53 its different to actively engage   celebrate sin versus trying to better yourself   follow what God said!
square enix has not been impressive for awhile. hopefully tomb raider gets more love with another developer.
lara just needs to be a sex symbol again. a cool greater than life badass tomb raider. there is nothing wrong with that. although being an actual platform puzzle adventure is also imporntat instead of bootleg uncharted.
deus ex  thief  tomb raider and legacy of kain... there s hope.. lulz.. oh well
maybe its the many years of life experience  been gaming since pong  but every time I see a company bought out by another firm  the end product gets further from the original concept till the only resemblance is in name only.  star wars anyone . I had my fun with the originals and while the  newer games are more  shiny   by trying to add so much console crap to them they have lost the efficient  streamlined game play I used to appreciate in the past.why does every game need collectibles  achievements  dlc  on and on  crafting  in a tomb raider game  talk about adding b.s. content to artificially inflate time needed to complete the story. meh. tomb raider  anniversary was one of the few surprises in my experience where something  old  was redone properly. if the kids like it  well  its not about me anymore and I always hope for success regardless.finally - its an investment - not a winning lotto ticket. they need to spend time and money even after the initial purchase instead of looking to make an immediate profit......
I really dont want a new generation of tomb raider. I wish they would go back to the roots with a bad ass lara. I feel like the storylines of tomb raider is unfinished or they dont fit together  I would love to see a sequel of the angel of darkness to continue the classic storyline.
seems good.
I really enjoyed the tomb raider reboot.  they were fun to play  though they should have renamed the heroine.  that wasn t lara croft.  I have high hopes this will mean the franchise will be brought back to its roots.
finally free from squareenix and their stupidity is a great thing.
I ll raise my glass when I hear crystal dynamics will  leave the building   funny people think its se  because the problem why tomb raider isnt tomb raider  is thanks to cd. they hate the classic lara. so I still have my doubts this will be a positive change.
I hope whoever does the next tomb raider puts in dinosaurs and more puzzles.
honestly after everything Im kind of done with tomb raider at this point. unless they do a full remaster of aod and the lost sequels  then I ll come running back lol .
Im hoping eidos montreal manages to make a sequel not only to deus ex  but to guardians of the galaxy as well. that game was amazing.
shit  since they bought gearbox.  maybe we ll get a proper duke nukem game now
could be old age and nostalgia talking  but square hasn t been  good  since they dropped soft and merged with enix and dabbled in western bs.  just floundering on historic fans and fairly close to decent games hinting at some parts of enjoyment compared to the days of yore!
it takes awhile to learn to ignore hype trains today. they work harder on hype than the product in many cases. it taught me the  wait and see  mentality which is good for mental health
@terry landess  very true! I learned a long time ago that marketing and trailers often may give us a very different idea of what a game entails  rather than the actual finished product! wait and see what actual gameplay looks like before considering buying.
so every game character is supposed to be a Christian or we riot....  lol
@melonie mac go boom  I was talking about people in general. for in-game I dont care as long as its rated 18
10 00 as you are a Christian your response of not condemning gay people is correct because it is unlawful to do so.  render unto caesar.
15 27 - istp  here.introverts unite!separately...in our own homes...
some people dont know what it means to be a Christian. in john 13 34-5 Jesus said we are to love one another. peter wrote in 1 peter 3 8   finally  all of you  be like-minded  be sympathetic  love one another  be compassionate and humble.  we love. we do not condemn. condemnation is old testament. Jesus  death is a fulfillment of the laws of the ot  and his new command is for us to love.
is it a good thing  depends. did they sell it to elon musk
honestly squere enix has been fucking up so many games these past years. and the ones they didn t screw up  they just flat out abandoned.its high time we get a new deus ex  legacy of kain  and a proper tomb raider.and the fact that they sold all of those for so little money  just goes to show how little they cared about them.
if barney was on t.v. today  he d be gay
12 00 - no deity who would torture someone for all eternity for loving someone of the same sex is worthy of worship  they aren t hurting anyone.quite frankly  if God is butthurt thatsomeone finds happiness and contentment in romance with someone with the same equipment then he should have thought twice about making them that way.a truly benevolent deity would want nothing more than for people to be happy  so long as they aren t hurting others.
anachronox  baby!
Christians are called to hold other Christians accountable to scripture.    do not hate a fellow israelite in your heart. rebuke your neighbor frankly so you will not share in their guilt. leviticus 19 17if you say  just love others  and  dont judge  while ignoring the rest  thats taking the easy way out. no one likes those conversations  but iron must sharpen iron. when iron sharpens iron sometimes sparks fly  but thats why you condemn the sin and not the sinner.the context of  dont judge  is to not judge people for doing the same thing youre doing. thats about hypocrisy. just because we all have struggles and no ones perfect doesnt mean thatsomeone who has struggles in one area cant help someone else in a different area. if that were the case no one would be able to help anyone with anything.
I disagree with the idea that as a Christian you need to always  call out  sin you see in others.  I think its far more effective to show how God made positive changes in your life.  let people see how you are different.  what s the old saying    you catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar  for Christians I think its important to remember when Jesus went to have dinner with the tax collectors and sinners and his followers tried to talk him out of it.  what did Jesus tell them mark 2 17  niv  on hearing this  Jesus said to them   it is not the healthy who need a doctor  but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous  but sinners. Jesus didn t go there and chastise them  he had dinner with them and talked with them.   they knew that Jesus was considered a great religious teacher and they were very impressed that Jesus didn t harass them for their evil ways but he treated them with respect.  that doesnt mean Jesus approved of their sinful actions but he showed how you should hate the sin but you can still love the sinner.
how much did you buy it for
mel  there s a difference between not condemning people for their sin and actually celebrating sin.thatseems to be a thing you get mixed up sometimes. its an easy thing to do  especially in current year society.I think the commenter was trying to point out this difference and that you appear to openly celebrate homosexuality in certain contexts  despite it being clearly against scripture.you also seem to get very defensive very quickly with the topic of homosexuality and miss the actual point of what people are saying and or asking.I also recognize its often difficult to clearly communicate one s thoughts and position on a topic in youtube comments.Imean no disrespect. Im simply hoping to maybe add some insight and or clarity. I hope you are able to look past your initial feelings or defensive instincts to understand what people are actually saying. much love  chica.
my question here is... are we surprised a company  that went broke back in the 2000 s because they try to sell a  character model  inserted in a movie tthat drastically flop  selling their studios and ips to purchase nfts   there are several quotes that fit here like 1.  the people who ignore the history is doomed to repeat it themselves  and 2.  history has cycles  and those cycles keep repeating itself
300 million feels its just for tomb raider  embracer group paid off part of square enix debts thats why its such a cheap deal.
is square enix ever happy with anything they do I think it was just a firesale to liquidate some assets hopefully with this sale will get classic lara back that mean self-centred individual yeah just gotta love it.
idk Im always happy for more tomb raider
please go back tr legend series and continue the story already. fan already make tr2 remake game which is good.
aslong as tomb raider still good game and physical copy for ps5 whatever next game called Im ok
since you got a new pc can I have your old one  mine is almost 5 years old.
yes!
they sent it to me because they are sponsoring me
@melonie mac go boom  oh  no. I was referring to tomb raider. who else would they sell it to   p
facts
let s not forget that they lost a fuck ton of money on the avengers game as well as it not having good critical reception. at this point itseems like crystal dynamics was making square enix look bad
yes  its a good thing. duh!!!!!!
whats your favorite Christian music mel
boom!!
any infjs in the house
bro you look good  gym and diet is working.
commenting to feed the algorithm
sqeenix   the ethics department can rot in hell for all I care
judge not  that ye be not judged.
maybe square enix needs to give up on marvel  since it under performed.
I think the publisher wanted profit above creatieve freedom the  developers do not have much input hopefully lara is freed from cencorship and current left politics
update on why square enix is selling tomb raider for so cheap.  square enix wants to be bought by sony but sony does not want their western companies.
here s the real reason why square enix sold them  they coldn t make 1 decent tomb raider game to be honest they haven t been good since eidos sold it to square enix long time ago. the last best tomb raider game was the one before square enix had it. think it was called tomb raider darkness or something where you can control a dark lara croft in a dlc. its only when it became cinematic and storyline focus  it lost its  challenge  puzzles  and hidden attributes with much missed atmosphere   and sex appeal went to shit.
ithis is great news. square enix is no better than ubisoft and ea or take two.
infp gang whats good
jeremy from the quartering is also sponsored by meta pc...veteran owned and operated
embracer group  ruh roh not going to be good
gosh to get your views on this. I hope it doesnt become tomb raider  microtransactions
remaster angel of darkness with shity controls
well  looks like Im 1st. so its my turn to say something for once   post some comments
lara croft used to be unique  until they turn her into a carb board cut out of every single  female protagonist exploring nature  character type in any other adventure video games. the only thing I like is her new face  slap that in the old lara and its perfect. also have to comment on your robert downey jr video melonie. you said eat lean beef to lost weight and that really offended me  high fat is perfect for weightloss because not only it wont make you any fatter itsatiates you so you naturally eat less also  was on raw pork fat and raw liver for a month  barely workout  ended up gaining 20lbs of muscle after 3 months while making those love handles disappear. dont be fatphobic
worst decision square enix could have ever done... Im scared to see what will happen to lara croft in the future...
I also believe in God and if he didn t want people to be gay bI etc  that wouldn t even be a thing. God is not some evil thing to be feared  Jesus literally said that we all sin  we are only human. everyone should love who they want to  because if that was a  sin  it wouldn t even be a thing on this earth. everything is made perfectly by God. I have nothing against Christians  but this is exactly why I dont call myself a Christian despite believing in God  there s just too many bad people in that community who misinterprets the word of God and live in fear of God they re whole life. that is not how we are supposed to live. God loved us all as long as you are a good person  who you love doesnt change anything. just had to say that.
I actually like the new version of lara croft. I hope they dont change it. I remember the original story game and I wasn t interested in it.
hoping to get a non-woke  lgbt tomb raider.
first
oh ma gawd am furst
Jesus voided the old testament.
I dont know I think tomb raider needs a break. I like the new games they have good gameplay but there is a lot of competition. maybe just make a really good tomb raider game every ten years or so. I dont even care about uncharted.
I hope nintendo buys tomb raider.
good the reboot series is trash.
I just hope they fucking get rid of sam and dont do thatshitty woke ship.
deus ex  tomb raider and thief are finally free from sqeenix dungeon!!
Im going to piss you off some now but be a soldier do you know any women who ve walked away from what you have because they considered it was  selling the gf experience  I ll bet you if they have  its because they got married so there s some truth to it even if it causes you to flee from it  every Bible verse can be taken as support or warning remember it is the voice of the author you are reading  not yours projecting upon it  relationships mean real insecurity and vulnerability  the internet just commodifies that then only the money reflects the vulnerabilities and insecurities and many people in your place see that as protections against such trust me  I lived in a world without the internet and I was a dude like most straight white american males doing a lot better without it I watched how it basically became bars making bands guarantee guarantee an audience for bookings so they could sell booze and of course some bands desperate enough would do anything to get people to follow them family  friends  friends of friends..people who never heard of them  seemed innocent enough  so fake it ..alright so you say guys do it but once again thats just selling the idea of  friends  people who see value in others time and opinions .but putting a price tag on it a professional friend..most heterosexual guys want a girl they can be friends with first ..the idea of  girlfriend  ..in my lifetime didn t necessarily mean sex was going on between a guy and a girl just that a relationship had been formed also what is your take on lara croft being a derivative of indiana jones  now that they think indiana jones must be removed from the big picture ..I ll agree there are some notable differences but the premise of the character is a derivative a rib taken from adam   right
you can lose fat on high fat for a while  but if you are trying to cut to extra lean levels you have to lower your fat. your body prioritizes dietary fat  so it will not burn fat on your body if you are intaking more fat than you are burning.
@melonie mac go boom  cant disagree  I just think eating all lean is a bad idea for losing weight. people only need enough fat to make them feel satiated  dont need to eat all day  enough to make sure they re not feeling hungry and eat all kinda of crap. really glad to see you promoting carnivore to everyone  keep up the good work
no.... just no

hooray!!!
eww
it probably wouldn t be woke.
