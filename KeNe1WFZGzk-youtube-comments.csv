we re simple men. if they dont care about the game  then we dont care about the show.
they do this every  fricking  time. they ruin a good thing before it can even get a chance to succeed. people get their hands on a beloved franchise with a massively loyal fanbase and they completely disregard the elements that built that trust. they could have a instant hit on their hands by sticking to game universe and playing in thatsandbox just like the players did with master chief. they could celebrate all the cool stuff in the games and little storylines that unfolded over the series and the existing fanbase would love it. the show could have a huge audience from the dedicated fanbase and then they would bring in their spouses  their children  their friends and their families to enjoy the halo universe as much as we did growing up and playing it because it would actually resonate with them. and instead of using that established fanbase as an asset  these people completely ignore that aspect like they dont exist. that audacity to not even think about the games instantly alienates the entire fanbase in thatsingle act of ignorance. the people creating this show just went from having a potential dedicated  audience in the 10 s of millions and said  nah  we dont need them   we re just gonna make shizz up as we go and take a chance on attracting a couple normies. we dont need an instant hit on our hands. dont do anything that could actually make sense and instead let s make this way more difficult on ourselves by trying to get random viewers who dont deeply care about this universe. yeah thatsounds about right bob  let s do things ass-backwards and ruin something precious instead of celebrating it. thats what everyone is else is doing nowadays  right  thats how we throw away all this good faith  right  we dont want to actually do something right for once do we  pfffhhhhh. insanity.
of course they dont care about the games. this is the  rings of power  show all over again. infiltrate a popular ip  disrespect the lore and games that came before them and use it to promote the message.
Im one of the biggest halo fans there is seeing as though Ive been playing halo ce since the beginning. the news that the show runners are deviating from the games and didn t even play them to begin with makes me highly skeptical. lol
when I read the plot leaks Imore or less checked out of this series. a human in the covenant  seriously  anytime the covenant have a human prisoner the human is treated like trash till they serve their purpose in activating forerunner tech. that is least of this series problems.halo reach  halo wars  and odst prove you cantell a halo story without master chief or cortana as the protagonist and supporting character which funny enough reach is my favorite halo game and chief and cortana are an easter egg and minor character respectively in that game. not to mention the comics  novels  the straight to dvd movies and the anime halo legends that all tell different stories with or without chief. we didn t look at the game  we didn t talk about the game  is the biggest red flag about this series.
hey mel  just discovered this channel and loved it instantly! its nice to see others wanting to be entertained without the woke garbage. I want halo to be a good show but Im not going to be surprised if its a bust. keep up the good work mel!
that is why I hate  modern hollywood doing video game comic movies. they almost never look at the source material. they only think of the ip as an atm machine. and you can almost guarantee that they will be very obvious about including  the message .
hImel. I have watched you since this channel started and have to say that you talk far more sense than most people who talk about gaming or world events. if we add that to the fact you look absolutely stunning  and certainly not in your mid-30s  you have got a certainty to hit 50k subs soon. I am not religious myself in the sense of organised religion  but do like to hear your takes on the Bible and certainly do not object to them. over the past few weeks I have recommended your channels to others and most have since subbed. good luck going forward and keep up the good work!
one of the reasons I started watching your channel was your passion for tomb radar. 20 years following thatseries is a lot of effort  devotion and time investment. I emphasise with this completely because tomb rader to you is halo to me. for 20 plus years I have followed this series. collector edition games  books  comics. hell  my wife who is also a fan snuck in  were itso easy  into her wedding vows  if you know you know   but they woke washed it for... race swapping characters  and not including sgt. johnson  who would easily fulfil the race quota . changing lore based on the excuse of the  silver timeline   and disregarding any fan criticism as some form of phobic  ists  or other bigotry label.it is.. defeating. but I guess its the halo fan bases  time to fight this bs.
I was literally about to leave a witty sarcastic comment wondering when she was going to stop calling it  my new channel.   she beat me to punch.  well played melonie  well played.
do you want it to be exactly the way you ve already played it and already seen it  yes.I ll be the minority and say yes  because thats clearly the only way these producers can make an honest adaption not guaranteed to be shitty with arbitrary decision-making on the level of paul w.s anderson. this is why I dont run the risk of watching live-action adaptations of video games  because I fear having to sit through another  resident evil    mortal kombat  annihilation    doa  dead or alive    tekken    the king of fighters  Im getting sick to my stomach. let me stop here.
we didn t look at the game.   thats like saying you didn t look at the comics when making a marvel or dc movie or show or you didn t read the novel when making a movie or show based on a book.
if they dont care about the games  then I wont care about the show when it comes out.
I think you should keep the  new channel  thing going ten years from now as a meme.shows or movies like this should exist in the same universe  or timeline as they put it  but tell a self-contained side story. dont retell chief s story. follow another spartan or three and how they dealt with conflicts fans already know. you can have chief cameo or be featured in an episode or two  but make it centered around the new characters. that way  its faithful to the franchise  building on a corner of the universe without alienated core fans while drawing in viewers  hooking them to want to play the games. profit! but no. we gotta get woke  go broke. everyone looses.
that cortana doesnt just look like a soccer mom  she looks like she was genetically engineered to be the perfect soccer mom!
hImelonie I am relatively new here  a couple of videos in now  and I have to say I like your channel more with every video. at this point and after many dissapointments I am not surprised how games and franchises are treated and I am not getting my hopes up for new anounced stuff because like what is the point  the people in charge are gonna mess it up for greed anyway  which is really sad. what really keeps me returning to your vids is your overall attitude and personality. you dont just go with the mass and stuck your head in the sand which I like  keep being you! although I am not really practicing my religion  also Christian  I enjoy your little bibelquotes of the day and your take on it. this one especially cought my attention because it would be so much needed these days. do good things for the sake of doing good  not because you want to be rewarded for it! a personality trait I respect alot! all the best for your future go boom  3
congrats on 28 000 subs! as for the halo tv show  its smart of you to not get your hopes up. you ve probably been asked this question before  but if you were in control of the tomb raider franchise  and you had unlimited resources  what would your dream games movies be like  also  would you want a tomb raider tv show and  if you do  what would you want it to be like
do you want it like the game   yes  but that wont have original stories do you want the same-    yes.  so you just wan- yes  oh my God are you a misog-   yes! I do not care  Im here for a freaking video game series Im not here for your take on a video game series  either give the fans what they want or dont do the damn series!
Im so glad you shared that verse!  my dad always made sure we knew this  and all the other Bible verses warning against behaving like pharisees  the ancient wokies .  its so great that there is somebody  other than my dad!  who is speaking about this!  go  melonie!
thatsounds like  we re going to do another mass effect game  set at roughly the same time as the reaper invasion  in another galaxy!
what show
@g vnhtsm  thats the spirit
yep
its pride   the writers are saying my  vision  is so awesome its better than the original.
how is it possible that these extreme woke people get hired everywhere in these productions
its not about the money  its about sending a message  - joker
the fans didn t want to see master chief with his helmet off but the studio was like  nah  ih ll be fine.
@lady blabla  because they are hired with one only prerequisite  their will to promote and support a certain ideological agenda  not their writing skills and any will to respect the world and the fans.
its star wars all over again
if they didn t see the games books  they wont see my money either. they are just shitting on the franchise at this point.
well in case you need more to not watch the show  there is a human in the covenant and chief is a side character
@stormy035  yeah my worst fears is they sideline chief for the new spartans. even though there where female spartans in halo canon. xd
@sunixjester  the least they could have done was watch gameplay walkthroughs on all the games and cutscenes for halo mcc. lol
@viperchief117  the fact they admitted to not playing the games or reading the books should signal a nail in the coffin to paramount. too bad they already green light a second season and the show isn t even out yet.
@viperchief117  oh no he ain t a side character to the other spartans  that would still pass   he is a side character to a character I always refer to as  random asian girl  because thats all she is  a random civilian thats somehow the protagonist...
did youreally think these sjw writers are gamers
ik
@notademocrat  I would hope that one of these writers on this show would have at least been a gamer and played the game.
@notademocrat  nope. the only individual who does play video games is spielberg. lol
seriously  we could ve had a series covering the orion project with a certain cigar-chompin  marine as the main character. he knows what the ladies like.
@bruce maximus  the issue is that hollywood does not know what we gentelmen and ladies like
@scifan 08  reach  and odst were the main reasons I wanted to get a 360. I hadn t ever played the first two entries but had seen some of the game footage  and played some multiplayer bits. I own fall of reach  and forward unto dawn and love both of those movies despite the fact that you dont see a lot of master chief in them! coming from a non-fan of the series  but will show the utmost respect for it  I think this is utter sacrilege  and just another cash grab slap in the face to fans.and youre right any time you have a writer who can proudly say that they didn t consult the source material -- when there s so much of it -- you know its going to fail. well Im gonna play le chifre and bet against the other works  the last of us  mass effect  yu yu hakusho  and one piece to all fail. might make a little money off of the companies producing them through their stocks  and sell just before their demise.
yeah  plus the whole master-chief is going to be more emotional and discover his feeling is a way to effeminates him  so they could bring in new female spartans that never existed to replace him. while leaving out blue team  lynda  and kelly  which are badass female spartans!its woke garbage  where they going to tell you  the  spartan armor will look better when it fits a woman ! there are like dozens of female spartans in the game and book series - what are they talking about  halo forward unto dawn is the best live-action short series of halo that ever being created so far  everything else is trash! God  Jesus Christ  bless!
oh man  I only made it through 20 minutes of doa. the tekken anime looks good though.
looking at her legitimately gave me a headache and I just woke up
I frankly dont understand the soccer mom references people keep making about her. she could definitely use a lot less clothes and be more transparent blue though.
good deeds are meant to be just that and youre right too many want the attention for doing them.  I will definitely have to check out the freakraider aod project.  I dont think I got past the first twenty minutes of the game because of the controls.  just glad I dont have to go boom more than once a day  Imight end up straining something.
being someone who isn t religious by any stretch of the imagination  I really  really like the Bible segments. keep doing exactly what youre doing. its greatly appreciated.
I recently discovered your channel thanks to adam crigler and I subscribed to your channel during thatshow  Ive enjoyed what Ive seen so far. the people behind the halo tv show and wanting to  fix  non broken formulas or ideas sound very similar to those who wanted to  fix  the star wars movies and their meddling blessed us with the sequel trilogy...
seeing what s going on with this almost gives you the feeling of being done dirty in an alleyway. no class  no respect. and Im not even a huge halo fan  but seeing how they treated this they could just as easily crap all over something Im rabid about. I fear for franchises like fallout and mass effect getting the same dirty treatment.
the games share the personalities from the characters  if a game franchise is going to be translated into a movie or a show  they ones that produce it and make it happen should do their homework and learn about the characters so they can use their personalities for other expandable stories and keeping loyal to the characters of the game  in this case halo.
master chief is not just a self insert  he has a personality thatshows through interactions during the game. they replaced that with their own character.
in the trailer there is a line where the admiral says something along the lines of  how do you control a weapon that does not follow orders  and then they show cortana. thats where they lost me. the chief does not disobey orders  he is loyal to a fault. hell  in the books there is a debriefing scene where some high level officials are talking about how the startans are  wind up toy soliders  and cant think outside of the box.
I hate when they say  do you want it the exact same as you already played   yes yes! how hard is this to understand. no body is going to watch halo to see master chief not be master chief. how hard is it for people to write a new story in an already established universe. all the heavy lifting is already done. people fan fic all the time and usually end up better then these people can do.
Im going to take a guess that all those great snapshots we saw  are from one well-shot scene in the opening episode  and thats all fans will really get.
I called it. I said that the reason they are calling the show a  silver timeline  is to disregard every single bit of established story  and just throw in the iconic stuff and call it a day.I dont expect them to sit through every single game  book  movie  and other media  or know every single tiny little plot point or lore detail  but this only highlights a basic lack of care for anything we could have wanted as fans.
imma level with youif they had avoided retelling the game but started looking at the long list of books and said we can make this in show or movie format id be coolbut the fact that these types always see an absolute ocean of lore knowledge and stories and say  thats cool were gonna do something completely different  they always do this they find a much beloved series of books movie games ect they attempt to get the series fans and the wokes on the first swing and then shock horror the og fans end up hating it
they need to make it more clear that whenever they do stuff like this to be like.  we re making an irl movie tv series based on an anime game that it is not going to be based on the actual anime game but instead we ll tell the story on what itshould have been because we know better.  that way their targeted fan base who dont have money or a thought  will be notified and the actual fans know to leave this in their fart in the wind.
we fell in love with the lore     we didn t look at the game    they read the wiki.
hollow out the core and wrap yourself in the lifeless husk of a once-adored franchise.  thats the hollywood way.
tell us about tomb raider  melonie but for real  I love how passionate you are about it. I wish the people actually making important decisions in the gaming industry  today  were even half as passionate as you are about tomb raider.
mel starting a video about a topic  ends up talking about tomb raider. mel really knows how to subvert our expectations  d
the story of the widows mite  is ahead of its time. if you have 70 million and  you give 5 million its no great sacrifice  if you barely make ends meet but still give to charity you are truly sacrificing.
do they know about the story  no do they know about the history  no do they know about the character  nodo they know about the graphics  no do they know about cortana s marvelous sex appeal  no do they know about the art  no do they know about the style  nodo they know about the canon  hell no
Ive played the games since I first got an xbox in 2004 and I have dreamed of seeing the original trilogy adapted in live action ever since. everything Ive seen about this series just absolutely bums me out. I wish this was made for people like me so I could share it with friends and family that dont game so they could enjoy the story Ive grown to love over the years. I want to share it with them. instead I have this that doesnt represent the halo I love and its just disappointing.
I hear the critical drinker in my head saying the message....yep its all about the message.edit  I was looking forward to your video on this.
do we care to see thatshow... no!
hopefully the show turns out ok. but  movie   show makers keep demonstrating that they dont want to make fans  of any stories  games   etc  happy  what they want is to determine what makes the fans happy.
visual effects in everything look pretty decent we ve go that down so whatever we do it will look good. now we just need to sort out the acting  writing  dialog  story  message  and direction and logic of the thing. stuff that films and t.v used to be good at.
there is a 10 hour supercut of all the cutscenes from all the games. itshould have been required viewing. not to force them to clone anything shot-for-shot but to give them a grasp of the stories tone  character arcs and the mythology thay re talking so much about.
mel has both brains and looks. what more can I say  I am not a simp who think that a person in the other end of the world could ever find a meaninfgul relationship w  commentor backer. ppl need to go out in real life to mack.  I like mel for her wholesomeness  we are diffrent as hell - bc I swear as a sailor. hundred percent more earnest though than most of the other ppl in the same sphere.
I wish there were writers directors that actually play videogames. so we can finally get a decent videogame adaptation.
its like the writers and directors skim the wikI page of whatever game or comic they re working on and say   yeah  we got the gist of it.
season 1 ends with a great cliffhanger when did not resolving your story become something worth bragging about
like most they simply want to use the brand to make money and spread  their truth
let s not jump the gun. maybe they meant they weren t trying to remake a game. maybe they meant they were going to expand the lore from the last game I guess. or maybe three.itsounds like they re starting with master chief at a position in his career to where he s already established. and is going to go through personal growth. if done right it can still hold nods toward the games and show the growth in a way that will satisfy us.
hey melonie I think the producer of this halo series doesnt care at all trying tofallow the video games.I believe theproducer is trying to compete against disney plus successful kickbuttmandalorian series.thanks for bringing this topic to life. have blessed wonderful weekend.takecare melonie
I lost interest in halo after h3. not because it is a bad series  but more because life made me focus on other things. I did random watch the halo film that was on netflix  which I really enjoyed. I also loved that mc was only seen at the end. I would really enjoy the show following that model. now what itsounds like is this guy is that kid in high school that wrote a book report without reading the book. Im kind of looking forward to this tv series burning
imagine being tasked to make a show based on a long running franchise and not looking at the source material for inspiration. me and my sonic boys got a fat w for once.
sounds about on task. movie and tv executives rarely understand how to translate a game property to another medium. there are exceptions -- arcane comes to mind -- but most of the time we end up with something like  well  whatever the heck uncharted was.
nothing will compare to running the maw 500 and beating it for the first time on legendary. who else seen the secret hug
I cant hijack every video and make it about tomb raider.  never give up. never surrender.
why tf they have to do this over and over again ! if you want to use something only as a  proof of concept   do it like screenwritter Christopher mcquarrie with  edge of tomorrow   2014  starring tom cruise and emily blunt  - its based at japanese light novel  all you need is kill  by hiroshI sakurazaka  but its made so good that its almost perfect by itself!and it doesnt ruin memories and experience with manga in any way! in contrary - you have double-tap!
new subscriber here  Im loving the videos  keep doing a great job!
the bungie you speak of is modern day 343  todays bungie is a whole different group of people who never worked on any halo game. this article did clearefied  atleast to me  how ms gave up creative control  cause it has been known for years that ms wanted to have strict creative control  which is one of the main reasons the movie never came to life  but from what ive read in the article I think ms was  starstruck  by spielberg. not to many people  including corps  will speak against spielberg  and sadly ms sometimes  only in the gaming space  is a little to naive.
the people thatshare what they do usually do little themselves. the clout is real and they just chase it at every opportunity.
I knew right off that it would be about the message.  they proved it in the teaser with the plucky little rascal the mc helps.
their prop department sure as shit looked at the games. those guys are on point. I ll probably feel like I have to give it a shot just because the guns and armor and all that other shit look so good.
I haven t seen this halo series yet but itsounds like they are skin suiting it the same way cowboy bebop s live action was.
was looking forward to this  it has the right look  starship troopers vibe. but now Im nervous about it. what is it with these studios buying ips with built-in fan bases only to go out of their way to piss them off  how hard can it be to do it right  look at jeff fowler on sonic  he retooled his whole movie to respect the source material and please the fans. I dont get it.
its sad that this halo show has to suck. I liked the original one back in the day. didn t follow the full storyline or get to catch the newest one but I was looking forward to what they re saying about the open world version. I got to play destiny  tenno  may have spelled title wrong   and another open world scifI that had a tv show. the game underpopulated and the show got 3 or 4 seasons I think. it was fun for a minute. either way let s keep fingers crossed for the possibility of success with halo infinite and hope it doesnt turn out like anthem did.
well darn. the preview looked so promising
some executive probably  let s make a movie show from this popular ip.hapless minion  excellent idea sir! how faithful should we be to the source material some executive probably  the what
the last time they tried to get original with an established videogames story line we got the paul anderson resident evil saga
this is your daily reminder that this is a  90 million fanfiction project.
love your vids  and cant wait to see you on fnt. really love that youread the Bible at the end of your vids.
thats one of my favorite verses as well. very meaningful. give in secret. dont seek attention. dont seek validation and rewards from others. do good things because it is pleasing to the Lord.
its a different kind of beast  thats what you say when you dont wanna piss off the person who signs off on your paycheck.
throwing money at something doesnt guarantee success  sometimes it just guarantees an expensive failure.
12 46Ive never met a virtue signaler who was a good person and Ive never met a good person who virtues signals...their mutually exclusive.      raginggoldeneagle
quick suggestion  your entire initial growth was 100  because of jeremy at the quartering. maybe you could give him a shout-out and or thanks once in a while
I like seeing aliens that dont look like an actor can be behind it.  but I dont expect we will see much of that.
glad I discovered this channel. my kind of  woman  just to be frank.also did you see the hogwarts legacy state of play  if so what do you think
comics are the purest form of storytelling. games have lost it  especially with how much nowadays take away control for cinematic cutscenes.
not surprised anymore .  I remember just loving and waiting for a movie or a new tv show or the next episode   dont got that feeling anymore on anything coming out as of late .
2 39  this is why fud was badass!
just watch.  its going to be a sitcom with a reality show twist.
its a shame really. halo could definitely work as a show with the right people in charge.
if they did not talk about the game I can guarantee they have no idea what I love bees is!
if they really need to know how to do a halo show  they have movies  forward unto dawn anyone
Im not a religious person in the slightest but that Bible verse is gold.I was thinking about the social media pandering as well.
love your channel and your energy. also  you are nice on the eyes.
does seem awfully coincidental that the people who shine the biggest spotlights on themselves for their  good deeds  and virtue signaling have the most skeletons in their closets.
I would be more worried if they just played halo 5 guardians and built the show around that  but the costume design looks great though I will 100  give it a watch.
its not a melonie mac video if she doesnt somehow talk about tomb raider or lara croft.every damn video!
as you get closer to 50 000 subs...dont forget the folks who were there at the beginning and perhaps developed a crush on you. you would think there must be at least one like that. maybe he subed at around 1500. Im uh...writing all that for a friend. yeah a friend. he s kinda odd though.  lol
she looks like a soccer mom!
Im at the point where anything made by hollywood is already a red flag. Im just gonna go and watch jujutsu kaisen.
I love fps s halo doom..I never had any real expectations that the halo series would be true to the lore in anyway..so this comes   as zero surprise.
I hope steven spielberg makes his own halo show or movie   because this one is gonna burn fast.
I cant hijack every video and make it about tomb raider. could have fooled me
the channels doing great
why let cannon get in the way of running the show. at least henry caville of the witcher loves the game so much that he fights the producer and show runners to keep the show close to cannon.                                        -boom
cortana does not look like cortana. besides the chief cortana is the single most important character  getting that relationship between them and her personality correct will make or break the show.
hino   halo in name only
look at what they re doing with the sonic movie and look at how they re treating halo which one of these do you think will be remembered by the fans and which one will be forgotten
they should of adapted the fall of reach
henry cavill played the witcher games before becoming the witcher so uh its kinda important to understanding the characters motivations and thought processes since the games have been out since I was a young lad its really important
how hard is it for hollywood to stick to the source material for any adaptation  respect the source material and fans will ensure that you make money. that goes for any fandom  even the ones I dont like.
the verse of the day is one of my favorites. its one of the ones I live by everyday and also proverbs 18 13.
Im not much of a religious person but that Bible verse was on point.
do not let your left hand know what you are doing  you say  but what about us that are left handed
if they dont care about the game  then I wont watch. cortana is a bit dulled down from how beautiful she is in the game. I will watch the first episode with an open mind and go from there. I ll get a sub for a free month and see how it goes. todays verse of the day is so important. I try to always pay it forward and help my fellow neighbors out. I dont want attention. the true reward is in my heart and how I feel knowing Imade someone s day a little bit better.
Im a huge halo fan. it is my favorite game series and this is coming from someone who mainly prefer playstation. when I first saw cortana I was like wtf did they do but I was like okay I ll overlook that. but then they said master chief is gonna take his helmet off I was like nope thats it Im not looking forward to this anymore. Im tired of the disappointment from halo steming back to halo 5 even infinite disappointed me.
Im watching this right after I finished watching think before you sleep where he put a clip of you in his video. I wasn t expecting to see you in his video lol
re  your verse of the day I think it is a very universal principle.I was brought up muslim  and we too have been taught the same thing about doing good for others - if you are doing good for others out of the goodness of your heart  for no selfish gain  one tends to not broadcast it to all and sundry.people who like to broadcast the good that they do are operating in bad faith  because it is for self-aggrandisement or other self-centred benefits - virtue-signaling for selfish gain.
meloine mac what about the tomb raider anime tv series that is meant to be exclusive to netflix !! how comes crystal dynamics and  publisher  square enix hasn t gave the us the fans more information about that    because that was the first announcement that they gave to the fans to know back in early 2021 last year the tomb raider reboot movie sequel was announced in mid 2021.
the reason they may not have wanted to talk about or look at the video games is because the guy who did the first 6 resident evil movies  did that. but  then also tried to put in different stuff and itstill made it like a retelling of the games themselves. but  because he did that. it made people upset and the movies were not very good. same thing with tomb raider  it tried to keep itsame as the game but  added in their own stuff to it and it made the movies bad in a lot of people s eyes. hence why they may not want to make the same mistakes with this halo series. plus  the series is a prelude to the original halo game in which we never knew about how the enemies of the game came about or why they just decided to destroy all of the humans or how master chief got his name. as the original game began  we knew him right off the bat as master chief but  as the games progressed with each sequel  we started to learn that there was more than just master chief which he was originally called spartan - 117 or john 117. so  this series is a prelude to the original game. we are getting a story that was hardly ever told in the games.  everyone should give it a chance without jumping on the let s just hate it right away bandwagon.
looking for a positive side here  my fellow canadians have to keep their donations a secret or they risk having their bank accounts frozen. stay humble
pablo schreiber is a good actor. I hope he did a good job.
the only game thatshould count for this show is the first game. tell the first story. make it look like the first story.
and there went my interest in it lol
love the games  not interested in tv movie franchises. some things lend themselves to a it but for me  halo should stay in the game realm.
I have literally been playing halo since I had access to a pc. this is my childhood they are f cking with. Im absolutely disgusted by the flippant development process. I have lost literally every drop of respect for 343.
are you big halo fan  because  Ive never heard you talk about it before.
if they want to tell their own stories fine. if they re good  great even. call itsomething else .
does this mean Im gonna be called some kind of  ist  for not watching  since they re not gonna follow the lore
lol the f are you talking about   anderson s re movies are a far cry from actual re games. its totally right reception being a butchered version of the franchise since the movies basically about making alice milla jovovich  his wife btw  as the center plot  totally not exist in the games. the whole things basically just pick   choose iconic stuffs   even then the writing simply a complete mess after the third movie. I do admit I still enjoyed a lot more than even the recent trashier woke version re  welcome to racoon  not  city.  hollywood wokeness will keep burning money because real passions of the serirs dont exist  only political agendas. dont even mentioned the new tomb raider movie being  remotely close  to the iteration of tomb rider lol
also  side note. I am definitely not a Christian. but I yet watch every vid to the end. you hit home so hard every time.
yes  you d be a purist  not a bad thing yea
I hope they never do a fallout tv series. I loved the campy feel of the first two.
philip defranco constantly threatens to punch people in the throat I used to watch every one of his videos. never once heard him say anything about punching anyone anywhere. that was something I started sayin about him soon before I unsubbed from him though lol.
what do we think about rhona mitra as lara croft if they do make another tomb raider movie!she started out as a lara model  then became an actress. has the look  and isn t too old  ha ha. they could not do better casting  imo.
as someone who has a halo multiplayer kill medal tattoo sleeve Im hoping they dont ruin this. the thing about chief not removing his helmet gave the feeling to the player that you were the face underneath. if the mandalorian can do a show and still portray the emotion without a face they could do it too. I feel these hollywood actors have to have the need to get their mug on screen and thats why we have to see them without the helmet costume etc. dont take the role if you are going to play a character that was notorious for never showing their face. I d be happy to be in the role and leave the helmet on. thats the dedication the actor should have to bring the fans what they want.
wait... this isn t about red vs blue  ..... the only good halo tv show ever made    caps intended
except for the characters  settings  and plot  its just like the game. but that pretty much leaves the name.
they didn t even need to play the game  they can just go watch all the yt videos with the cutscenes...
so now they will show his face and he will be a guy thats named pablo in real life     wtaf
master chief -  looks awesome  sounds a bit off  just cant put my finger on it...cortana - looks like a discount aI from the 90s  yet sounds perfect  how d they manage that they should have stuck with the voice and look for both  and it would ve been so many points in their favor.
this is another example of icing on a half-baked cake.
the halo universe is massive.  there could have been thousands of stories to tell that would have fit within the existing canon.  but  no.  they d prefer to fundamentally alter everything about the story to tell their own special version that fits their specific ideology.  sounds familiar...
all they had to do was adapt the fall of reach book for the first season  and they would  have been golden.  but for some reason that I cannot fathom  they thought they would just mess up the lore because they thought they could tell the  better  story.  come on spielberg  what the hell were you thinking   I thought you were a fan of the games and books   is that not true or were you very  hands off  of the production of this show
all I ll say is this do what you want cause a pirate is free  you are a pirate!yarr har fiddle dee deebeing a pirate is alright to bedo what you want cause a pirate is freeyou are a pirate!you are a pirate!yeah!
look  all I want is band of brothers  with odst and the mc spartans as supporting characters  not the focus...but no  we cant have that...and folks wonder why they can never get game adapatations right.
biggest facepalm and brainfart moment from hollywood as of late.
a man who rediscovers his humanity so robocop. youre retreading robocop.these people are like mr. burns when lisa tried to help him. youre unoriginal  and even when you try to be original youre even more unoriginal
I cant imagine joe staten is happy with them disregarding the halo Bible.
how the fuck can you even hope to pull in fans or respect the source material if you dont even know the origins. how were they even the choice for this.  keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
thats a good verse.
the quartering crew signing in.
I ll admit  I dont hate the new voice of master chief. I do hate that they ll have him unmask.
the do find consultants and super fans for the show  problem is their knowledge doesnt go past the first few wikipedia entries but will call themselves super fans i.e amazons lotr trop people  the super fans will happily gutting canon because its hard work to remember or surpass  and replace it with  modern  reflection tropes  ie representation  lgbt
halo was the last straw for me. as much as melonie loves lara croft  tomb raider is how I feel about halo. as a halo fan I cantell you we wanted this show back in 2009 when it could have been something decent but we quickly realized it was going to be a bad idea when no progress was made on it. then as hollywood went woke and broke we definitely didn t want it. and to this day  a week before its coming out.. we still dont. this is not halo.
all Im hearing is  let s take someone else s craft and just make our own shit
corporate executive  I know absolutely nothing about what Im working other than a quick glance at wikipedia  but those gamers are stupid  and will buy anything if its made after their favorite franchise.
yeah  this was announced as non-canon sooooo
Ive never been a fan of the games but I despise when the source material is not respected.guess like they finally got around to doing something with this show after the success of the mandalorian though. with the way pedro pascal has bitched and moaned about people not being able to see his face  itseems this show is going straight into not keeping spartan helmets on.
as a gamer this is funny and I am a huge halo and fps guy but holy cow Im not that big of a nerd to watch a stupid show about a game Ive played for so long...
imagine peter jackson never read lotr before making the movies. ridiculous
cowboy bebop  Lord of the rings  halo  there is and will be more in the future.  the message  is the only storyline worth following for these hollywood productions.
congrats on the 28k subscribers  but to be honest I dont care anymore what they do to these shows. why should I allow the woke mob to ruin everything  I get these shows for free since I torrent  so its no damage to my pocket. at the end of the day entertainment is entertainment  but they keep this up though and I will just go back strictly to anime.
unfortunately with woke culture cortana will not be the same as what she looked like in the halo games back before woke culture.
cortana gives me instant distaste. I guess its the trauma  but I dont see how that look is the best they could do.
there was a halo show. it was called red vs blue. why does this need a remake
I think people are completely misinterpreting what they said. probably purposely because itseems the halo fanbase desperately wants this show to fail  because as we all know  nobody absolutely hates all things halo more than halo fans.
I blame the current ip holders for allowing this
and another potentially amazing adaption bites the dust. seems like a reoccurring theme with any adaption of any ip  just strip-mine the hell out of it  give it to non-fans  bastardize everything until its unrecognizable for the normies who dont know or care about it  or it ends up pissing everybody off and despite losing millions of dollars...they rinse and repeat.
why adapt a pre-existing property if youre not going to pay any attention to what came before
lol I been under a rock.. there s a halo show  did they even read the books..sheesh!
he wrote more than 265 drafts and he couldn t figure out that not following the game s lore tactic isn t working out  what kind of a fuck up are they making exactly
are they going to at least follow the books
dont know cortana  as I never got into the halo games. so Im just going to assume that really bland looking woman is reboot lara s mom. its a striking resemblance  yes dont feel bad. in spite of numerous tarzan adaptations over the years  edgar rice burroughs fans have literally been waiting a century for a well done book-faithful version  the first tarzan novel was published in 1912 . the recent john carter movie was also a very mixed bag  with poorly cast leads and a completely rewritten protagonist. as for the cheapjack pellucidar and caspak movies from the 80s  well the less said the better.
so much opportunity is missed when a production company doesnt look at the source material of their projects. dont want to rehash what happened in the games  well and good  the source material for halo has something like 25 to 30 years worth of blank space that the human covenant war covers  and master chief was active through all of it. maybe follow the early days of the war  when the spartans were still in their late teens and early twenties  and transitioning from being used as  anti-terrorist oppressor  covert ops troops into supreme kickers of covenant butt and war heroes. that way things could actually be canon and not awkwardly crammed into a pre-reach timeline and shuffled off to an  alternate  universe.
thank you melonie mac
Im mostly pissed that master chief or any other already established and beloved characters  arbiter  sargeant johnson  half jaw  even the banished  are not the main protagonist of the story  rather a group of vapid and inconsequential  spartan  plug-ins directed by people that have no respect for the source material or its established fan base. a couple of great examples of their lack of regard for the source material are the master chief face reveal and the antagonist of the story. the covenant does not allow humans into their ranks as they view the very existence of humanity to be blasphemous much less allow one of them to lead alongside the prophets. I grew up with the halo story and regarded characters like master chief  arbiter  sargeant johnson  and cortana as heroes throughout my childhood. Im getting very tired of large corporate entities attaining the rights to our beloved stories and malforming them into something barely recognizable to profit from childhood nostalgia and to further their own agendas at the expense of the narrative s quality. its happened with so many beloved stories as of late and now halo as well. some might say something to the effect of   its not canonical  calm down fanboy.  and to that I d respond by saying that youre right and youre wrong  it depends on how important the story is to you. not to mention that to morph the narrative into whatever you want and when its met with backlash  you hide behind a guise of non-canonical  silver time line  is disingenuous and insulting. it reduces halo to little more than a bad fan fiction. well  regardless  life goes on. I think we re all used to it by now. that we all expected something like this to happen. at least  we still have the games and the novels  the real halo story to fall back on.
great vid  melonie...
I am a long time halo fan. been playing since 2001. it was better before 343 took over. they should be more concerned with producing new content for halo infinite rather than a woke-garbage tv show nobody asked for.
the show being non canon is not an excuse for bad story telling  halo legends did super well with non canon story s  it had the classic and iconic halo music  it didn t try to put in a message and they got the art style and story all right. it actually felt like it was halo. its disappointing that this show has to be another bad video game adaption because the showrunners wanted to tell a generic scI fI story instead of a actual halo story  this is even more annoying considering halo has done super well with adaptions in the past like sonic has. in fact instead of watching this woke shit  just watch the halo legends anime  it gets everything right and treats halo with respect. in fact id rather have a halo legends 2 instead of this show. if there is fan demand for it  it will happen.
what a coincidence  I dont care about the tv show...so we are even.
as a once big halo fan. the pics you showed looked cool except for cortina. I wont be consuming it.
I given up on everybody but zack snyder
one thing Ive learned over the years is that  if critics   the fks on twitter dislike something  its probably good and worth checking out.update  saw the pilot episode  and just as I thought  it was awesome.  about master chief s gender reveal  Im just glad he wasn t a transbender .p.s  the covenant human was reading a book  find out its meaning.  the dawn of angels
if its going to be bad then this is great news. might make it just feel like a generic scI if show rather than ruining halo.
of course they didn t respect the source material.
for me  halo had its day years ago  same as gears of war. bungie took the concept as far as they could  while the 343 sequels have been an increasingly routine  unfocused mess  lacking any spark. infinite s mulitplayer is very polished but the whole package feels dated
just looking at what we know about the show you can see they dont care  helmetless chief  protagonist is random asian girl  raceswap both keyes s and soren-066  ruining the tragic story of soren-066  not sure but itseems so   adult scientist miranda keyes  human in the covenant  human-looking cortana  telling the same story instead of something entirely knew ....      no seriously  there is so much that can be done within the lore of halo about marines  odsts  elites  other spartan iis both known and unkown  no because people seem to forget most iis had long enough carreers to have games and books about them and somehow we barely have names and thats it  and a lot more wich is my main reason for not liking this show  lack of creativity

as a fellow halo fan  I refuse to watch this show. my mind was made up as soon as they announced the show was not going to be canonical to the rest of the franchise. glad my instincts were correct. dont wanna waste my time with this.
hey mel I just want to say that I have seen an ad for upcoming halo tv show series coming to tv and I thought it will be okay to see and watch but if the show is not good and great to watch then I will not continuing to watch it if it is not good  ok. anyway I just want to tell you that and see if you will be watching the new halo show series  ok mel. anyway I also want to say that the halo video game is properly will be based on a tv show which some tv sows are based on video games  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that  ok mel. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night  ok mel.
we all knew they didn t look at the game because they had a human female living openly with the covenant instead of being eaten by the brutes if she was lucky. yes they took prisoners in halo 1  halo 2 but they weren t going to last long. they only needed humans to activate forerunner technology they couldn t interact with. after that they just killed them or worse.this show is a joke. they re pulling characters out of thin air and adding them in for diversity. they race swapped captain keyes. they re showing chiefs face. they made cortana look.. weird. they have a human commanding covenant. they have spartan iis with long flowing and dyed hair. they have a fucking chevy fucking tahoe and a fucking ak-47 on another fucking desert planet in another fuckin sci-fI franchise!!!! Im fucking tired of desert planets!oh and spartan iis all had the same armor as master chief in halo 1. it was their uniform. wasn t until halo reach they added customization with spartan iiis and I guess jorge joined in. they were army at that point so I think they let more go in terms of modding their armor.
wokies can call for violence against someone and the location of that person
the only positive thing that will come out of it lmao
a proper odst story I would love to see.  it was my favorite of the series.
@icepicjoey  if you loved odst you may like the short comic series called  halo   helljumper  its short but hella cool. its about romeo and dutch before they were reasigned to alpha-nine
@stormy035  thank you  I didnt know about that one and will look it up
@icepicjoey  well Im glad you do now  tho idk if its only available like that but I bought the ebook version in a collection with 2 other small comics series   1 with chief and the other with I think black team
@stormy035  just ordered the graphic novel from amazon.
@icepicjoey  amazing  I hope you like it !
the master chief is halo. if they dont make it about him  its garbage.I dont think anyone realizes the voice isn t thatsame either. wait till that first episode and he starts talking. instant outrage.
they wont please fans with this show just like amazon crapped all over fans with the wheel of time show. these companies dont care about fans at all  they just want to use the name of the billion dollar ip s to make money. I honestly believe fans should boycott all these adaptations to show that they cant do this shit anymore. did you know its literally a marketing tactic to tell the public that these producers  etc.  are huge fans of the games books whatever  most of the people making these adaptations and stuff have never played the games or read the books. just like what s his name with he man.
when are you going to do that video about aliens. I am very intreged about this topic as a chrsitian myself  and I would very much like to hear your opinion. I personally believe that they  being aliens  do not exist.
doesnt care about the games  presumably doesnt care about the books either with how many liberties they re taking with the story.seriously  why is microsoft allowing this to happen to their biggest cash cow  they d only just won back fans with halo infinite. and we ve already been burned several times over with tv series that replace the male lead with original character do not steal female character. do the showrunners actually believe that they can find a new audience when they piss off the original fans  this just screams of short-sightedness.
we are literally approaching an economic hard time even before recovered from pandemic disaster  meanwhile the woke hollywood just keep burning money...
same story over and over. -- niche product creation garners massive support from fans and customers. -- new hires and new ip holders try to make a name for themselves by making the ip  mainstream. -- ruin or completely change the initial ip to appeal to  wider audience. -- piss off and villainize fans and established customers.-- new  mainstream  audience doesnt really care about the ip one way or another.-- release revised and rebooted ip to golfclaps and wet farts from non-audience.-- ip is destroyed and rendered financially non-viable.-- sell ip for pennies on the dollar to random holding company to recoup some losses.-- people responsible are promoted or hired at new companies to start the entire cycle over again elsewhere.
you know whats wrong  most of the die hard fans who support this. im really sad for the halo fanbase  they are so hungry for good content even if it means throwing the core ideas of what made halo the game it is in the first place.I expected more from the die hard halo fans but honestly im pissed reading them like halo its doing ok  and that few of its issues will go away soon. they are so passive with how bad 343 and ms handle halo.
let s go boom!
I feel I have to say it here to. no  tattoo s are not inherently unholy and sinful. it would depend on what is tattooed. and being tattooed is not in violation of the ten commandments. explanation   scripture makes it clear that God cares about the inside of a person more than the outside.  man looks on the outward appearance  but the Lord looks on the heart   1 samuel 16 7 .
didn t watch the witcher  not gonna watch lotr series  not gonna watch the halo series. the best way we can show our dissatisfaction at what they re doing to our favourite things is by not giving them our money or our time. these people aren t making these things with the fans in mind  and they wont be content until they fully ruin everything we love and hold dear!
Im not surprised that no one even played the games to make the show. Im not a halo fan  and I still think halo being a game is a stupid excuse for not even trying to be faithful to the universe.
imagine you are adapting a book and you have to balls to say  no  we didn t look at the book. we dont want to be limited by a book while making an adaption of a book. reading is for dorks.
everyone have a nice day
itseems Im the only fan who supports this  and Ive been a serious fan since halo released on the xbox. there is a lot of misconceptions out there  false info  downright exaggerating and unnecessary outcry about this series  and while I get why  people cling on to what they re accustomed to   its a bit unfair. especially given that we haven t seen the show yet. a few people saw the first two episodes  and most seemed to enjoy it. two episodes aren t enough to really gauge the full potential of this show  so we ll see...I want to say though  there are some things you got wrong here  for starters  several of the actors have played the games and watched all of the cutscenes  pablo being one . he also started reading the novels when production started.although the directors didn t play the games  they worked closely with 343I and read through the lore. surely that counts for something  and I cantell you  if youre not a gamer  picking up the game will only frustrate you. as naturally as it comes to us gamers to use a controller and control a character and the camera  for people who dont game like we do  it is frustrating and takes a while. my girlfriend and mother can attest to this. when they have to start writing a story  they dont have time to sit and learn how to play a game  where only so little is told through each game. think about that for a sec.I dont understand the outcry for chief revealing removing his helmet  he s comfortable wearing it and sometimes keeps it on for very long periods  but he actually does remove it  a lot. there s no actual reason why he doesnt remove it - it was simply a gaming decision made  because in the games  we are the chief. this isn t a video game though  chief isn t us. unlike the mandalorian  there s no code thatspartans keep their helmets on - in the novels  he has taken it off a lot.now let s also look at this from a practical standpoint - all the other spartans will be removing their helmets  while chief constantly  for 9 episodes  does everything in his helmet. why  what part of that makes sense  what s the justification for if  because  he leaves it on in the game   in the game  do we eat breakfast as chief  do we talk to our friends and just chill  no  in the games its justified to have his helmet on  because we only play missions. do you guys expect chief to be on missions or preparing for missions  during every single moment of the series and lastly  chief is pretty much a robot who s all about getting the job done  however he has to do it. he only became more humanized from halo 4 onward. but still  he s extremely stoic. this is an opportunity to develop his sense of humanity - and touch on how the spartan program robbed him of that  psychologically. his relationship with halsey  kwan and cortana gets to do just that  as he remembers the messed up things they did to him  and as he begins to feel real empathy and not just a sense of duty. the only empathic thing chief has really done in the games  was disobey orders to save find cortana. everything else he s done was to accomplish a goal that will help save humanity. how do you expect to develop john s emotional growth  while he s completely covered  for no other reason than  well  he doesnt take it off in the games! . its impossible to do effectively  over 9 episodes  if you cannot see his eyes... I am sure there will be times when he confronts halsey or experiences deep  emotional hurt - and you guys really expect them to deliver this  and have the viewers  many of which have no idea what halo is  connect with chief  without revealing his face  it is a preposterous proposition. especially  when all the other spartans are walking around without their helmets. so he ll be the only one walking around with his helmet on  24 7 just because...and do not cite the mandalorian - he has a code to not remove it. and even he broke that code.people need to be a bit more open-minded and realistic. everyone is ready to cancel the show  and haven t even seen one episode yet. give the damn show a chance  please. judge it on its own merits  is all Im saying.
believe it or not Ive never played halo  Im an xbox owner now and plan to catch up Im not going to watch the show until til Ive finished them all if I even bother
yaaaay  another woke shitshow that ruins an ip. there was already a miniseries that wasn t bad  halo 4  forward unto dawn . it wasn t amazingly brilliant  but it was good. they should have continued with something in the same style of story. that would have worked perfectly.
from looking at the trailer...only master chief and the gang look great.
are we really surprised at this point
if you do something good itshould be anonymous
go boom!!!!!
also I saw the perfect response to this news  our story is different because its in another timeline.  would you look at that  my money for this show is in another timeline!
I quite enjoyed forward unto dawn   even have the bluray. they could have done the fall of reach  it would ve been interesting. but I suppose that requires too much effort.
Im only here for the  tomb raider hijacking every video
I just want to ask microsoft why
many people have put together cut scenes of every game they were just lazy not to go watch a few youtube vids. halo tv series is doa. Im calling it now the female will become the new master chief at the end of season 1
oh I just saw this on gab  wasn t sure what it was about.
boom! 28k
it wont even be a season one. it will be known as  complete series  on dvd and streaming after its initial run fails hard and gets cancelled.
rad  lol. boomer.keep rockn yo!
this is gonna destroy the halo brand and thatsucks in my mind melonie
Imean I will watch it because I have paramont plus  but man I fear this will be trash.
bam! bam!!booooom!!!!!!
fan-disservice.
these people love to alienate the core audience that would ve watched the show
343 have destroyed cortana they hate her look at the copy  they put in halo infinite. and cortana helped chief with his humanity I halo 1 2 3 the games have never been the same since 343 took over
and exactly nobody is surprised
almost 30k subs
so just like rings of power and disney star wars this will devolve into nothing more than fanfiction. how sad
are melonie mac go boom fans  boomers
5 20  I cant hijack every video and make it about tomb raider!  are you sure about that  just try harder!  p
commenting to feed the algorithm .  and wow first comment
thats exactly what they are  fake fans   fake gamers duh!!!!!!
first!!!
...wut  who is this for then
just like star trek  cowboy bebop  star wars  doctor who  etc... these stupid studios just want to put a veneer of ip over some generic crappy show they want to produce. in the hopes the audience is stupid enough to swallow it because nostalgia.
galileo was a conspiracy theorist.
halo  needs more tomb raider.
no surprise at all look at lotr  sw  st  comics and disney
boom!
because who would ever need to experience something to get an accurate feel for how to pull it off.heard the aesthetics like creature design and gore were good  but the story....silver age au
and we dont care about the tv series  so its kind of like a boomerang  isn t it
cool
you should do a Bible verse clips channel  my sister does not give a fuck about the culture wars in america but I think she would enjoy the verse parts. think of it like a verse of the day channel.
they didn t play the game  ok cool  I ll just leave the show alone and go back to doing doughnuts  over people  on sidewinder.
halo tv show runners  we didn t look at the game .... just like the new star wars didn t look at the existing lore and all the eu. freakin pisses me off!
more female lead spartans than male... in halo.... a war game.  doa.
and with that I lost interest in this inevitable shitshow
why would you show master chiefs face !!!!!!
if its nothing like the game  why the f  even name it halo
just like how they violated wheel of time and lotr. Im never watching any of those again.
I sub
great  cortana went from the cannon aI blue binary code bombshell to a mid 30s soccer mom thats still swimming in debt from that bachelor s degree in nursing. fuck.
day 18 of commenting on your videos until g fuel sponsors me.yeah this is ridiculous. like bad enough youre on paramount plus and we gotta dig to find it. not interested.
what the crap is this ! just what I thought. wokeness is going to destroy this halo series and its going to end up just like he-man revelations! Im pissed off!
this is disappointing considering I left the star wars fan base for halo.
to the showrunners this a vanity project  a gig. making a cash grab about a well known gaming franchise to get people to subscribe to paramount plus.
classic case of hollywood narcissism. they purchase some usage of an ip and ignore what made it great. then when fans hate it they will gaslight the fans. typical abusive behavior. Imight pirate the show.
I think it ll suck.
yea... been watching your vids of a bit now. though about 1 2 of every video is just comment reading and Bible..feels like thatshould be less than 50  of the video. maybe 20
doa
I got to say calling your fans  boomers   probably isnt the best idea  boomers  kind of has a negative connotation.
I will not be watching this because the showrunner does not even know halo and therefore the ip will not be respected nor given the treatment it deserves. these idiots always gotta ruin the things we love on purpose.
if I smell identity politics in this show I will cancel    delete paramount from my subscription
notice how they use the master chief in every screenshot there  but they show is about this diverse minority woman from the trailer !classical bait and switch !
stealing legendary cannon from the gaming culture and pillaging it.so is this concidered cultural appropriation yet
how the hell do you throw 20 years of lore and story out the window and just make shit up yourself. this is such a spit in the face to fans new and old
halo has died and lost the interest of most its original players besides the only decent  halo show  is red vs blue
it ain t a 2022 show if it isn t a bait-and-switch. you gotta luke skywalker  he-man  hawkeye the main character so we can have an uber powerful disney princess. destroy the patriarchy. what a recipe for woke go broke. and now this geeeshus they dont even play the game  fans come for what they loved about the game. they gonna witcher the master chief. stop doing this hollywood. may you lose tons of money and lose your ability to do future work.
the virtue signaling is getting out of ocntrol. conservatives and carnivores are the latest and worst offenders..  I try to give em crap for it evey time I see it.
they didn t look at the game or use much  if any of the source material  because diversity  representation    inclusion. its just another woke wash bait   switch. wont be wasting time on it. a lot of people are already walking away.
another title that doesnt care about the lore. its getting a bit weird now. so many science fiction fantasy shows are doing the same thing. same kind of message and cast. its boring and forced.
again they chase the wider audiance. not everything has to be turned into star wars. who cares about halo but halo fans
ok boomer
@melonie mac go boom  not a boomer gen x   but still funny
.. wow they butchered halo . not surprised.
why do these people contract i.p s only to destroy them  I knew from the first trailer it would be crap.  expanding  it for a broader audience is translation for  we will please no one.  Im a hardcore fan since halo  ce launch day. I wont support this knockoff rogue one piece of putrescent trash.
what do you expect its just a bunch of none gamers wanting to ride a popular franchise for money. I bet the producers and writer for the tv show haven t even played all the halo games. at this point I would rather have an actually gamer and fan write and produce the show because at least you know its being created by a fan of the franchise.  maybe  Im shitting on it to soon but the fact they stated in the tweet they didn t play any of the games just signals to me the show will be disconnected. how do you expect to make a show about x topic when you dont even learn about x topic and then they expect the fans and community to just be happy about it....naw
nopenopenopenopenopenope
oh they dont care about the games  good. bc the fans of the games wont be watching this poop show .
key kids  I wrote a new halo book. master chief if a black woman and kelly is a transitioning trans. please buy my book....jk
meh
552qufvur.fyi
just you wait  newest tomb raider movie  featuring a black muslim gay transwoman with autism etc etc. not appearing  laura croft.
and watch - they ll have master chief take his helmet off only to reveal its stacie abrams underneath.
last comment I promise. quick prayer request for everyone. I love praise. seriously I d work for free sometimes as long as I got praised for it. I need to stop this and just do things because its the right thing to do. I need to let go of this childishness. thanks.
10m an episode....you lose. sry kids
