in all fairness to the fans of this debacle  fighting the haters is all they really can do as nothing has happened on the show for them to talk about.
the fact that they need to defend the show is a problem. growing up  when a show  movie  book or comicbook was made  it was released  and you either lived with the failure or revel in its success.
sometimes to find the light you must touch the darkness  this is something tolkien would never write!!this phrase means you must be bad sometimes in order to obtain a good result.  tolkien was totally against ever doing anything bad.  the entire point of the lotr story is that you must always be good and do good deeds and then good will prevail.  you will not find any good character in any of tolkiens books doing something bad for the greater good.
the problem with the  just let people enjoy things  mentality is the things have to be enjoyable. amazon  disney  and crystal dynamics bought ips to get the fanbase. the problem is  when these corporations take the beloved items of fans and twist it especially to fit the new  truth  the fans will speak out.
I think the thing that pisses me off the most about shows like rop that doesnt get brought up very often is that tolkien was very explicit about the things he believed in and cared about and what themes he included in his books. he very much believed in traditional morality  that a warrior ethos while important for defense was not the be-all-end-all  and thatsimple acts of kindness and humility could have monumental impact. thatsort of philosophical depth is what separates it from all the generic fantasy that came after. compare that to rop  which is so lacking in introspection and understanding that it just defaults to modernist hollywood morality while wearing a tolkien skinsuit. it was those themes and ideas that kept me coming back for more. what is it that alleged rop fans see that attracts them  nothing that I can identify with.
I admit that when I heard galadriel say   money is only something you need in case you dont die tomorrow   I had no idea she was on minimum wage. what dedication! so brave  so stunning!
as a kid growing up  never in my life have I felt a need to see myself in the movies or tv shows I watched. I loved and still love movies and tv shows like terminator  aliens  green mile  saving private ryan  Lord of the rings  m.a.s.h.  seinfeld  game of thrones  cobra kaI  etc and I love them because they are very good and or exceptional as works of art. I never wanted to be a killer robot  elf  karate kid  soldier  king  comedian  doctor  etc. this incessant need that these people have to project themselves into everything thatsurrounds them  makes me want to vomit. they are always set on finding excuses for any shit or dumb behavior. someone should tell them that excuses are like assholes  everybody s got one.
the show was never overhyped. everyone was cautious unsure about it and the more info we learned about it the more red flags went off. this toxic positivity is exactly the same for kenobI cause people I know have an issue with me being the person that didn t like it  its like they are coping with the fact they are trying desperately to love it.
this bizarrely reminds me of a line from shallow hal   who s the all-time love of your life    wonder woman.   would it bother you if the rest of the world didn t find her attractive    not at all  because I know they d be wrong.  if these people genuinely liked rings of power  they wouldn t care that the rest of us think its garbage.
I love how the rop  super fans  that amazon interviewed haven t made a single video about it.  one of them also is watching hod cause its sooooo good.
saw someone on fb saying   all the haters are just upset tolkien isn t a comic book! its like  first of all  this isn t tolkien. its far closer to a modern comic book  so your criticism doesnt even make sense. and even then  no they dont like that itsucks  even most of the defenders are admitting nothing happens at this point  and the mc is insufferable lol.
I d gladly take reading one of the Lord of the rings books over anything like this.
rings of power fans are the ones who read weird lotr fan fiction. also congrats on 50k melonie!
congrats on 50k. so glad your channel is going strong. we need more ladies like you out there
genuinely grateful for the more frequent uploads - I really enjoy watching your videos.
sometimes to find the light we must first touch the darkness  - when youre in a dark room looking for a light switch on the wall
something from the real second age  the leaves were long  the grass was green  the hemlock-umbels tall and fair  and in the glade a light was seen   of stars in shadow shimmering.tin viel was dancing thereto music of a pipe unseen and light of stars was in her hair and in her raiment glimmering.there beren came from mountains cold  and lost he wandered under leaves  and where the elven-river rolled  he walked alone and sorrowing.he peered between the hemlock-leaves and saw in wonder flowers of gold upon her mantle and her sleeves  and her hair like shadow following.enchantment healed his weary feet that over hills were doomed to roam  and forth he hastened  strong and fleet  and grasped at moonbeams glistening.through woven woods in elvenhomeshe lightly fled on dancing feet and left him lonely still to roamin the silent forest listening.he heard there oft the flying sound of feet as light as linden-leaves or music welling underground in hidden hollows quavering.now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves and one by one with sighing soundwhispering fell the beachen leavesin the wintry woodland wavering.he sought her ever  wandering farwhere leaves of years were thickly strewn by light of moon and ray of starin frosty heavens shivering.her mantle glinted in the moon as on a hill-top high and farshe danced  and at her feet was strewna mist of silver quivering.when winter passed  she came again and her song released the sudden spring like rising lark  and falling rain and melting water bubbling.he saw the elven-flowers springabout her feet  and healed againhe longed by her to dance and singupon the grass untroubling.again she fled  but swift he came.tin viel! tin viel!he called her by her elvish name  and there she halted listening.one moment stood she  and a spellhis voice laid on her  beren came and doom fell on tin vielthat in his arms lay glistening.as beren looked into her eyeswithin the shadows of her hair the trembling starlight of the skieshe saw there mirrored shimmering.tin viel the elven-fair immortal maiden elven-wise about him cast her shadowy hairand arms like silver glimmering.long was the way that fate them bore  o er stony mountains cold and grey  through halls of ireon and darkling door  and woods of nightshade morrowless. the sundering seas between them lay  and yet at last they met once more  and long ago they passed awayin the forest singing sorrowless.
I could not stop laughing when melonie pointed out that guyladriel was one of the least paid actors. amazon enforcing that gender pay gap!
4 53 I love the part where galandriel says   sometimes to be Christian  first you must become satanist.  so wise  brave and inspiring.
congratulations on just reaching 50k subs  melonie! at the rate youre subs are increasing you ll be hitting 100k in no time. will you be bringing back the  verse of the day  sometime  it was always great to hear you sharing some of God s word!
this
hate  not really.  people just dont like it because it is not good.  that is perfectly a valid point.
@bear lemley  did you not understand the joke
oh something happened lol.watch shadiversity fight scene autopsy lol.
the only entertainment this show has provided has been in the scathing youtube reviews. thats what I look forward to each week
fighting my two handed battle axe of logic  logistics and lore with that paper sheet of a shield of their personnal diversity and woke culture agenda.
nothing for the haters to talk about.
@bear lemley  its excellent and you made no point.
then it was just stories. not political hills to die on.
good art needs no defense but its own substance
its just evidence that this is tied to a deeper agenda behind the scenes.  there is literally no other reason to feel the need to attack those that dont like it.
here s an opinion. galadriel sucks. they break lore  badish writing. still better than woke house of the birthing scenes.
not to mention we ve all probably enjoyed a tv series  movie or game that wasn t up to scratch before  we ve liked something that had issues  and we re allowed to. these guys should just enjoy the show if they like itso friggin much  but their attempt to defend it at every opportunity tells me they actually think its crap  but need to maintain a positive perception of it to keep the theatre up.
@emma     the annoying bit is that  if they really were capable of defending it  they would not be calling people names  they would just list the reasons why it is good   does it have a good story  good fight scenes  does it honor the original source material without deviating too heavily   my guess is they cannot answer those questions  so they resort to insults.
@creatv  yeah. resorting to insults and trying to say no no its good because both exemplify they dont even know themselves what is good about it
@peter h  this. when fresh prince of bel air came out  everyone loved it because it was funny and entertaining and thats it. nobody was screaming from the top of their voice  black people have their own show now  only racists aren t watching!!!
we all used to be mocked by people for liking this stuff  in spite of it not being popular. now you get the ones who jumped on the bandwagon crying  I need it to be popular because I invested in it.
I was there. 3000 years ago.
thats how youremember things growing up  sure. but you grew up in a time before the internet and youtube film critics. no one cared about any of this shit back then  coz then we couldn t be fed this ridiculous amount of information and daily updates about some show that no one actually gives a fuck about. but we get caught up in the mockery and the vitriol coz its fun to watch ngl. nostalgia goggles.
@sherlockinsomniac  Im only 29. lol
exactly! back in the day  we had no choice but to do that. also  having to wait to actually see the movie based on one or two very short trailers on tv as opposed to pretty much the entire movie being shown in advance on the internet before its release was a thing back in my childhood. young folks are spoiled these days.
sometimes to honor tolkien you must butcher his work and disgrace his memory.
was that what they meant by  sometimes to find the light you much touch the darkness     thats what it always sounded like to me but then I was like  there s no way thats what they are trying to say!
true. that line is more for a spawn comic. she is an anti-hero then.
thats because martin wrote it and did it better in context. hereby I quote you prophesy  given to dany by quaithe  to go north  you must journey south. to reach the west  you must go east. to go forward you must go back  and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.   george r.r. martin  a clash of kings  daenerys iii
I know  but what can you do when there s a tempest in her  in all honesty  this series was produced and filmed during covid-2020 2021. these writers were clearly out of toilet paper  so they used tolkien s work.
sounds like someone trying to find the light switch to me.
@considerablysane  dany was always meant to be the bad guy in the end  though.
jackie  jackie!! they re touching me again!!! - the darkness
you are talking about a group of people that always believe the ends justify the means  they are the antithesis of tokiens moral beliefs
@too many marys  really debatable. she certainly could go anakin skywalker  her was is that messiah way with constant balancing of the dragon vs mhysa. but writers on the shows  both  are just incompetent to write compelling path for such a character
tolkien was a roman catholic.he literally would ve wrote something like that.
who could forget the memorable scene in the silmarillion when manwe tortures thousands of vanyar to answer the question   are we really the good guys  or does melkor have a point
@audra t  I dont think they really knew what they were trying to say. they just say things that they think are profound but that dont actually mean anything.and that truly represents the depth of their intellectual capacity.but hey  the sea is always right  right
@too many marys  based on what  because based on the books  she could not be further away from what she became in the show.
thats why its called  high fantasy ... lotr falls into thatsubgenre of fantasy literature. its basically the forces of good against the forces of evil and nothing more. game of thrones is low fantasy with some magic here and there but the main focus is a gritty grim world with the most characters in a grey area of moral ambitions and deeds. rop is just badly written and produced and the actors cannot do a thing about it. I really think if they dont get the thing turned around in season 2 it is over and the amazon boss will pull the plug. at this stage and pacing and story telling they will never make it to five seasons... no way.
@dragon ball fans cant read  he literally wouldn t have  thatstrictly goes against roman catholic moral ethics stemming from paul   and not rather  as we are slandered  and as some affirm that we say  let us do evil  that there may come good  whose damnation is just.
@brandon  considering the catholic church preaches  Christian light  whilst committing darkness of abusing little kids  I d say the quote is spot on.
this
it used to be directed at  critical theory  noisemakers demanding changes to suit their political views  it makes no sense in response to fan criticism about the quality of the actual content.
the problem is that millions of flies are experts in flavors of shit  but to people that have not an acquired taste for crap  its still smelly inedible mess.
things does not have to be bought out to turn into crap  and sometimes even the original producers directors etc destroy their own franchise. we used to get bad sequel additions something people have forgotten because now we have bad while being woke additions. it is so bad that people celebrate getting just bad sequels as long as they are not woke.
there are people who enjoy it though.so stop crying and move on.
@dragon ball fans cant read  the people who dont like it are entitled to voice their opinions just like the ones who do. I suggest you stop being hypocritical  and maybe as you put it just   stop crying and move on . if people want to talk who are you to demand they stop  just because it doesnt agree with you
I used to work for ubisoft s marketing branch. the first rule is  if you hook the kids right off the bat  the parents will buy. we  25  y.o.  aren t the target audience anymore. its our kids. because kids are easier to convince that what we shit in their mouth is good for them  and cool. but dont spell it out for them  otherwise it will break the illusion that they really think for themselves. twist their herd instinct into free will  and you will have a fanbase guerrilla.those who are trying to break the veil  however  they are against us  against you  against your very nature! they are racist  woman haters  pederasts  vampires!so yeah  the product is not what is sold anymore. it is twisted values  indoctrination and a power struggle between the good and evil. the woke and the incels.
the thing is I dont like a show like this I get told youre a sexist incel  its not for you  stop crying and move on  lol lol lol why you getting so upset about a tv show. however when these people dont like something I do  james bond   dnd  splinter cell  hogwarts legacy  etc  I get told its bad  wrong  fun and has to change be cancelled. you can make stuff and say its not for me or people like me in the same breath you demand stuff that is made for me or people like me be changed to not be for me. its hypocritical and why people are getting fed up with these shows. especially in a case like this where they re changing established lore  established characters and crowing about how amazing it is and how the fans of said original lore are wrong.
@dragon ball fans cant read there are people who dont enjoy it though. so stop crying and move on.
the real issue is  that Im not trying to stop anyone from enjoying anything at all. they re definitely trying to stop me from having my opinion though.
by the same measure there is a point where you have extracted as much critique out of something as is humanly possible without simply repeating yourself over and over merely for the purpose of padding your channel content.we ve waaaaaaaaaaayyyyy past that horizon at this point.we get it - the show is crap  its an insult to tolkien  the writing is crap  the showrunners are gaslighting    hats and the actors are barely competent even when they are correctly cast for the role.there literally is nothing more to be said now without moving on to something else  so get on with it already!
@vincent_ graymore   sometimes even the original producers directors etc destroy their own franchise see pj s the hobbit and season 6-8 got for more information
nothing s twisted except that a few minorities are added to the show instead of being far away people s like in the original books. if you have any non racist complaints  feel free to voice them.
@considerablysane  how is it inedible mess
the problem here is that they didn t buy it. amazon does not have the rights to the silmarillion. end of story. this show doesnt exist.
they shouldn t force politics from the real world down everyone troaths
@ad bylsh  if you mean people complaining about the black characters  I agree. people s racist politics should not enter the topic of enjoying the show. I cant wait for season two.
have youread lotr
@reek  yes  have you
@spitshinesneakers  no  he hasn t. he s said enough stupid shit in other comment sections to make that completely beyond dispute at this point.he s also a paid troll  you cantell because he never actually comments on the show.... because he cant lie about it as an amazon employee without it being false advertising.
@spitshinesneakers  great  yes I have
for me  the acting is more to blame for the poor performance of rings of power rather than the writing. its just a 2nd rate level if acting from these actors. compared to house of dragons  the acting from thatshow is vastly superior to rings of power.
the fact that you can separate yourself and your opinions on the tomb raider comments demonstrates intellectual honesty.a dying quality in many people.
@raistlin majere  seriously  are you telling me that with a line like  its hard to tell which is up and which is down  its the performance thats the problem  oh Im not defending the acting in rop  those actors are fricking terrible  but the writing is abysmal. Imean  sauron went into hiding while leaving a map to where he was burnt into corpses of his enemies  Im sorry  not even sir anthony hopkins could read that well. galadriel looked for sauron for hundreds of years and only now thought to look at a map  yeah  no  ben mendelsohn cant fix that one. she s going to swim over the ocean back to me  Im sorry   charlise theron couldn t make this work. its a big bad evil world with many dangers  orcs  sea worms... but elrond and his boss walk from lindonto kazad dum in their night gowns  and then his boss walks back alone  meanwhile  numenor is sending whooping three ships to  face the darkness  on the word of a woman they picked up in the ocean  I dont care if you hire the entire pj movies cast.
@plonker  moral ambiguity is not what makes philosophy deep. you can have a deep philosophy of just good and evil if youreally probe into people s motivations and the consequences of their decisions. frodo s journey in particular is especially cerebral as it revolves heavily on the effects of the ring and how people respond to it.
@plonker  I wouldn t call it  merely circumstantial   you could make an argument for fate but I think tolkien was being smarter than that. the ring was not destroyed by accident  because gollum was warned repeatedly that if he betrayed frodo  the ring would force him into the fire. the reason the ring was destroyed was because evil in the end is self-destructive. sauron s own short-sighted malice cursing gollum was what destroyed the ring at mount doom. even if that was illuvatar s plan from the start  that has less to do with some predetermined outcome and more to do with knowing about the nature of good and evil. and it was frodo s pity that allowed all this to happen  so even if bilbo attempted and failed to kill gollum  then it was still up to frodo to make the right decision. and frodo continued to show pity to saruman as well when there was no larger cosmic reason to  he did it just because it was right. its a consistent theme across the whole story.
this was so well put  thank you.
the website that has the salaries is just some random website in india that is posting unsubstantiated information. these salaries are not based on any source.
add ff viI remake to this please.
well said.
Im reminded of the things I loved as a kid.  parent or elder thought I was nuts for liking the things I did. still do because  as you pointed out  it doesnt matter if someone else likes it or not.
I both love and hate how most people complaining aboot rop pretend to care aboot the source material  but haven t even read the books.
hotd is 5 times woker than rop.
@brett goodrich  true but has a lot of incest and if you check the american intrest in adult sites you can notice why house of woke sells better
@reek I doubt you ve read the books
@lex night  because its actually decently written  unlike rop
@brett goodrich  barely if at all  rop tops the woke chart
@brett goodrich  which is fine. the  philosophy of hod was woke anyways
@brett goodrich  it really isn t that woke
@brett goodrich  how is it woke
same. when was the last time you ve read them
it has been a few years since I re-read some of the lor.  lately  within the past year Ive listened to the old unabridged audio books   here on youtube. it is amazing all the things I had forgotten. the imagery that comes to mind and just letting myself drift into the world of middle earth with the audio is something Ive enjoyed.
lotr fan fiction is better written.
@riftrender  yeah  real tolkien lotr fan-fiction is way better!
now if only they d actually try reading tolkien s work itself  rather than spending all their time reading their borogorn ship fanfiction.
rings of power fans are the ones who never read tolkien in the first place  they just move from franchise to franchise with the rest of the cultural locust swarm because they re desperate to be seen with  the cool kids .these are the same airheads who just loved kenobI so much and now couldn t tell you the name of any character not in the original trilogy
@petrie w  exactly right! they just want to open their mouths and spew talking points and shit without actually knowing what the fuck they are talking about! its so crazy  but its hilarious at the same time as well! let s be real  these people are absolutely out of their fucking minds!
@petrie w  most of the people complaining aboot rings of power  claiming it contradicted the source material  have never read tolkien s work too.
@reek  and what s your proof of that  we know that the fans of this show didn t read tolkien because they dont know anything about any of the characters. what s the hint for people who do know about the characters whether or not they ve read the book
@mamamob  I have seen many videos of people bashing the show and read the comment sections. I have seen so many people praise jackson s lotr adaptations as faithful  or falsely attributing  evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.  to tolkien.
@reek youre attempting speak for  most of the people..  what a load of crap
@reek  maybe its not accurate quote  but it is what tolkien did intend  melkor was only capable of corruption  like with orcs and trolls.
@mamamob  dont bother feeding the troll bro. reek is taking time out of his busy gloryhole schedule to muddy the waters.
rop fans aren t tolkien fans. they re just pretending to like lotr because its popular. they re leeches.
this really mans a lot  thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  so what would womans a lot to you
@rev pembroke  what did you just say  lol
thats the first age

sometimes to become antI facist and antI racist  first you must become facist and racist.
@hermit card  oh shi
Imean she didn t say that.in any case j. r. r. tolkien was a devout roman catholic from boyhood  and he described the Lord of the rings in particular as a  fundamentally religious and catholic work . while he insisted it was not an allegory  it contains numerous themes from Christian theology.
@dragon ball fans cant read  she did say something like that in the show.
@marisbury animusphere  did she say that quote word for word yeah  thought not.
@dragon ball fans cant read  4 55 in this very video.  sometimes to find the light we must first touch the darkness. take your l and go.
@harbl99  which mentions nothing about Christianity.even if it did  Christianity is a central theme in tolkien s work.he was a professed roman catholic.youreally haven t read his works have you typical cringe republican with his fake outrage lol.
@dragon ball fans cant read  you ve completely missed the point of this comment...
@dragon ball fans cant read  I am no republican but rop is garbage and an insult to to tolkien s memory. take the l and move along.
@violet s place  I took no ls and stated facts.
@dragon ball fans cant read  ooh you should  youreally should
@violet s place  you make no sense.
I agree! I am a big tolkien fan ever since I read  the hobbit  when I was ten and  rings of power  is just disrespectful to tolkien. I also like that you pointed out that our favorite characters dont need to look like us to be our favorite or relatable. my favorite characters from my childhood are captain nemo and sunset shimmer and I dont look like either. love the video!
Im feeling pretty secure about myself and what Im supporting   which is the preservation of classic literature for future generations to enjoy in their unadulterated forms.
instant quote   this is a giant scam!
congrats on getting to 50k!I dont think this show even has fans  its either tolkien fans who heavily delude themselves or people desperate to get amazon s attention.
what in the kingdom hearts writing is going on here  better than rings of power and more applicable in context thats for sure
I just imagine the  fans  of this show aggressively chanting  he will not divide us! he will not divide us!!
melonie  I love your content. much success to you. keep rockin   girl.
you ever wonder if someone in the writers  room ever raised their hand and said   can we not be controversial for once   see how that goes  maybe
just let people enjoy things . me -  Ive literally seen no one ever saying you cant enjoy itso let me enjoy hating it. let s call it what it is  your upset you like something people think sucks...
I am no stranger on the internet s mom. its not my job to validate anyone over a show. also congrats on the 50k
congrats on 50k melonie!!!! yay!!!!! believe it or not I liked the first tomb raider movie. I thought angelina jolie did a really good job. oh and the dialog on rop is so bad. Ive read children s book with more depth.wow that pay scale...yikes. where s all the money going  that meme.   I love watching your videos. they make my day. keep up the good work melonie
congrats on 50k melonie. I love your content  and you always seem to make me laugh.
nobody gets left behind! nobody gets left behind!  except for when they do  by us .
I bet amazon specifically told the writers to have the episodes split up so some storylines dont appear in some episodes  like the harfoots in the last one  so they dont have to pay the actors for that episode. so when norI gets 10k per episode  she may only be in 4 per season  so she could only be making 40k for the year for doing the show!
its because people who like things like tlj or rop dont actually like the media for itself  they like being part of the social group that likes the approved thing.
youre never wrong for going against the grain  youre wrong for allowing someone to dictate your actions. sometimes its healthy for you to develop your own opinions instead of always using the reasonable excuse of  I looked for reviews so I dont waste my time . once in a while  try not to do that or better yet  follow my advice and dont listen to me at all.
this channel is going to explode! keep up the great work!
in terms of socionics  they re mostly going to be types with fe  extraverted feeling  focusing on the sentiments of the group  rather than fI  valuing one s own feelings and morals  so they re going to be trying to control the feelings of the group and gatekeep the group as such. usually its te  extraverted thinking  types which are thought of as  controlling   since they tend to focus on solving problems and organization generally  but nothing is more annoying than fe types that try to tell you how youre allowed to feel about things or idiots standing on the behalf of the potentially offendipated. though inaccurate to some degree  there s still a nugget of truth in the phrase  fe stands for fake.
hey melonie I just wanted to say thank u for all the times u have usedto make your videos.I absolutely enjoy seeing your opinions  thoughts onthese topics.takecare melonie
to be fair  some kids may want to see themselves in movies or comics  animated shows and such. especially if they are told they need to. I remember slightly being that way when I watched superfriends as a kid. I slightly gravitated towards aquaman and green arrow because they were blonde  like I was. a few years later I grew out of that.
thank you
donald wouldn t be out of place.
true they seem like the same crowd  same telltale  scrutiny  for details.
people like that dont last.
there was a tolkien expert working for them to try to keep the shitshow in line. I dont remember if he was fired or if he got tired of their shit and quit.
reminds of this line   why torment yourself! saying  eventually  someday! how long have you been fighting  with your thoughts clouded by that brand of sweet poison ! this line reminds me that poisons toxicity can be sweet too. and much more insidious than the outright bitter ones  which is why I hate two-faced people as they never mean what they say.
I went in feeling admittedly influenced by the negative reviews... but I did manage to watch the first two episodes with a fair bit of enjoyment. they are intriguing and beautiful... but thats about it. the show starts to fall apart somehow after episode 2 and just drags  and I found my own issues independently from everyone. I do feel there s a lot of pointless nitpicking but thats only natural when the show crumbles at its foundation  youre left sifting through the debris  desperately looking for something nice. that is a testament to how awesome tolkien s work is  the fact that there s so many people still willing to bother  fighting for the magic.
the issue with people like this is that they cant defend an objectively bad show movie just by analyzing it  because the deeper you go into it  the more problems youre going to reveal. and so the only way they can defend it is by attacking the critics or attacking good and or popular shows or movies.this is how we get people to say stuff like  sw fans are toxic  or  sw was always goofy .and the thing is  those aren t even actual arguments in favor of the thing they re trying to defend.
got a lady at work in her 60s. she watches she-hulk  she thinks its damn awful but hasnt missed an episode because it makes her laugh and so.shss enjoying watching it.
I was just trying to find the light. ted bundy.
this has become an open war with the cast  the show runners  the entire amazon prime company against anyone who has a lil bit of love for the work of tolkien.
am currently reading my 8 year old son Lord of the rings after he requested it after finishing the hobbit hes loving it there is no self insert  no politics     that is lotr.....  timeless unlike rop which will be forgotten in no time!
Im autistic. I wish morfydd had given me the heads up on how to monetize emotional blindness
great point. I love the hobbit movies and the love that went into making the films without worrying about how much other people dislike it. not a big deal.
its wild how some people cant handle the criticism so much they actually try to take down larger content creators who are creating content covering the flaws of current media... like having a negative opinion of a franchise is deserving of someone losing their livelihood. the internet is a wild place.
great video melonie!love listening to your critique on rop in particular  keep me coming  d
just discovered your channel and after watching a couple videos   Imust say youre awesome
new to your channel. great analysis. you kind of have this semI gothic look happening but without the drearyness
love your videos glad youre uploading more often
in defense of the salaries.  orlando bloom was hired for lotr and because he was a relatively unknown active he only got paid  175 000 for his role in the three movies.   but it did start his career where he gets a lot more now.  the full collectors series of the movies are about 14 hours long.  so that equates to about  12 500 per hour of film.
Im convinced these people cant genuinely enjoy any media  Im of the opinion they dont even like or watch the show themselves  they simply back it out of  obligation
Im a white skinned half cuban and when I was 3  I wanted to be the black ranger zack. I dont need to see myself in a show to connect with a character lol
noticed this on reviews. a majority of the positive reviews contain insults to its detractors. the negative ones do as well  but to a much lesser degree. insults in a review are a sure sign that the reviewer is coming from a place of emotional reaction and not critical analysis.
the tolkien fan in me screams a little more each week this show goes on. only serves to give me the fuel to argue people into silence on social medias.
they identify with the show and characters so much that any rejection of the show feels like a rejection of themselves and their character. its narcissism.
I dont think you can say the show is objectively bad. thats like saying Im literally dying reading this comment.
@manny brum  you can absolutely say a show or a movie is objectively bad. there is such a thing as standards of quality  even in art.
while touching the darkness at the same time.such a glorious quote!
Im the same and jeez  at 27 yo I am more ethically savvy than galadriel halfway through some 5000-8000 years  in human years  of her life.
I like the hobbit movies ... but I understand people s complaints about them.
they play it on mute while they sip whine.
my hero was eddie murphy. 90s was peak post-racial culture. modern left is cartoonish with racism.
anyone with a shred of empathy can  see themselves  in any human being simply based on the experiences that character goes through
@petrie w  agree  if we want to solve the representation issue we need to address the source of the problem  the shitty parents who raised all these racist loudmouths. if you need to see your skin color to relate to someone  you were raised wrong period  your parents should be ashamed.
clear difference between no empathy  full on narcissism and on the other side normal  regular people out there.
that never happened.
@dragon ball fans cant read  what didn t
@dragon ball fans cant read  reading is hard
@kamikaze kuban  your little story.
@arachnabell  no
depending on the contract they might get royalties  per diem  and other things. still not a lot  compared to hotd  apparently around 100k and episode for main cast
playing with amazon s money is like playing with their emotions.
you keep saying a billion dollars.  it got me thinking about it.  maybe besos is siphoning that to deliver his promises for blue origin.  ula is finally getting their be-4 engine much to my surprise given all the delays.  I dont expect rings of power to improve.  their last launch to sls kinda blew up.  blew chunks out the rear then quit.  cargo only.  no crew.  cargo survived though.  the emergency escape system worked.
here s to the big 50k. your love for tomb raider taught me its okay to still love franchises that have gone to hell like halo and saints row for instance.
all the  deep  lines they crap out for this show sound like they are written by the sphinx from mystery men. if you do not learn to master your rage...  then rage will be my master  thats what you were going to say  isn t it   not necessarily...
galadriel was always good  kind  and generous. also a magic user if they had gotten that right it would be more watchable.
my God this is one beautiful little woman. very astute and informed and all while being feminine and gorgeous. smart and pretty is a hell of a dynamic. love her!
im so glad you use more blue light now!  -d also.. the first tomb raider might not be the the best movie out there but it was fun! I loved that angelinas tomb raider had fun doing the stuff  -d
if 20k per episode for galadriel is really true  I cant imagine it is   then she got totally ripped off. for thatscope there is a zero missing. the best running shows paid the main cast millions. oh boy  haha.
this so called rings of power has nothing with tolkin masterpiece
I watched the first 2 episodes out of curiosity and watch channels like this just to check how the fire is going and it is glorious!
its kinda sad to see the highest paying salary is only 40k when the adult cast from the show modern family made around 65k per episode for the first season. keep in mind  not only did the modern family adult cast get paid more per episode  but they also had more episodes in their seasons. rings of power has 8 episodes while modern family had around 20 ish per season. with a bit of persective  the rings of power actors got cheated.
congratulations on 50k  mel!! the og lotr rules  all the rest is meh. and Im not that into fantasy  in general.
those salaries are really surprising. surely there s a deal where they get bonuses based on how successful the show is   10-30k an episode
Imean  mulan is and has allways been one of my favorite characters of all time since I was a kidd  and last I checked I was not asian  nor am I a woman  and yet I identified with what she stod and strived for   aswell as the struggles she was facing  to this whole debacle with kidds or ppl needs to see themselfs on thatscreen to identy is and has allways been horseshitt  and if thats how someone feels  id say its probably some other reason in the backround as to why the struggle to identify with characters they like just cuz it dont look like them  the way hollywood and all these actors framing it  its more as if kidds-ppl are identifying with the skintone instead of the actuall characters  and if thats the case id say the has been thoughts wrong from the start as that is the very thing thatstarts off segrigation and racism   and I thought we where trying to get rid of thatshitt as much as possible  and yet we instill shitt like this to make it more obvius then ever aswell as putting it in places where itshould never be in the first place
they could have easily said  sometimes to find the light you have to walk through the darkness.  or something like that and it would have made infinitely more sense. how did this show cost a billion dollars
its crazy how many movies and shows are in direct opposition to their target audience. going to war with their fans and shit. I like to see fan bases standing together in excitement for good content. hollow knight community for instance we re waiting impatiently but everyone s excited cuz we re confident the fans  best interest is in mind. why cant it be more of that get the woke shit out of here
they know in their hearts itsucks   and yes as you say they need validation.
as someone who is part of the sonic the hedgehog fandom  I cant tell you how many people Ive heard say how much they connected with sonic as a kid and how much itshaped their childhood. Im pretty sure those people aren t anthropomorphic blue hedgehogs faster than the speed of sound just guessing. saying that people only connect with characters who look like them is shallow at best. and if thats true  how did a blue hedgehog and a red echidna connect with me when I was playing the games  reading the comics  and watching the shows
@melmacgoboom - oh man! soooo true...fans are most definitely insecure as are the haters. it works all ways. we are all looking for validation  in all varying degrees   which is why we comment. all content creators are looking for validation and some are even the most insecure individuals you ll encounter...because validation   views likes and views likes      ! its a vicious circle  I say embrace it!!! have fun with it!!!  yolo
exactly like I care if I see someone who looks like me represented its not about race or gender its about good characters and good stories not real worlds politics
the boat sees the sky is why it floats  duh.
@mungeparty  while the stone looks down so that the darkness touches the edges in order to reflect the light!
she is a high elf  she doesnt use magic in the literal sense  she is spiritually powerful by her very nature.
but their are not humble enough to accept it
but that does not mean the same thing. they mean to say that you have to be bad sometimes in order to be good. what you describe is more like walking through a bandits den rather than joining the bandits.
it didn t cost a billion dollars. not yet. amazon set aside a billion dollars at the beginning for the show to commit to production of two seasons in addition to the money they spent on the rights  250 million iirc . the first season cost about 465 million to produce. still expensive  but the billion dollar figure is for 2 seasons  which gives them a slightly larger budget for the second season. I dont think the show is completely bad  recent interviews with the cast by various people show that they care deeply about the lore of their characters and the silmarillion  I think they would have been better served talking about that pre-release instead of politicizing the show . I do think the show suffers from them going in thinking that a second season was pretty much guaranteed so they could spend a whole season just revealing the enemy.
the opening combat scene in tomb raider was awesome.
let s say that we going to give the benefit of the doubt and that the entire billion budget is for all 5 seasons. but if thats the case  would it make the quality of costumes and stuff make more sense  or would it make things seem more suspicious
its crazy how common sense is now a rarity with people like if you compare content like this to let s say the trend that is woke pop culture its like 10 to 1 we need more people like this to just be honest and stop catering to woke culture just because they wanna be liked
morphyd s only making 20 grand a show  no wonder she has a tempest.12 31 - puppy!
thats the thing  I like what I like and I dont need the general public or critics to validate me and tell me its good. most of the time even when shows or movies get bad reviews I still watch it for myself if its something im interested in watching. then I form my own opinion on whether I enjoyed watching it or not.
65 million dollar per episode boys and girlscongratz for the 50k!!!!  3
how long did they take to shoot this  a year  so their top paid actor got  240 000 for the entire season and norI got  80 000  these people need to fire their agents.
what is written cannot be unwritten  what is said cannot be unsaid. what is remembered can be a vision  fate can be unwoven by pulling a single thread.                                  aja jamesin other words the story was already written  but has been rewritten by fools  using notes.
what in the kingdom hearts writing is going on here  was the best possible analogy xd
when you grow up loving Godzilla you learn to appreciate it by yourself lol
20 years ago  the friends cast was getting  1 million an episode.
I wrote a review on amazon. gave the show two stars as I love bear mccreary s soundtrack and visually its had some great scenes but criticized the writing. amazon emailed a rejection stating that the review did not meet community standards.  iow  I didn t give it five stars.
Imean I dont think its that bad tbh. I like the extended lotr lore. and seeing more of the stuff from the silmarilion.its not massively action packed but it is enjoyable.
Im a fan of the show and not insecure but I agree with you. if you love the show just enjoy it. but same time if people do hate on it all the time  well they dont need validation for that opinion either lol. anyway even as a fan of it  doesnt come close to the movies.
the way to take accountability for your mistakes is to blame others. thats the way it is.
when I read the Lord of the rings by j.r.r. tolkien in high school before the movies came out  I didn t care what other people thought of it.  I didn t need validation from anybody.  those people who need validation of their favorite shows are insincere.
this whole mindset of only liking characters thatseem like you is the mindset I had as a 5 year old. I dont mean that to insult these hive mind weirdos  I say that to be realistic. I was always picking the girl characters in games because the boy characters were boring and not pink or purple. difference is I grew up  these guys clearly didn t.
I thought that with watching a movie its about enjoyng a story in the movie  not about enjoying that you watch a movie with a title  d
excellent job on getting 50k subscribers melonie!
agreed. I love the show and stay watching it. if ppl hate it thats fine by me
tomb raider is a dumber female discount of indiana jones
community standards require more 5star reviews to be manufactured before your review can be processed. please try again next quarter.
wrote a two star review as well and got the same message.
there s literally nothing from the silmarillion in this show. its not extended lotr lore. its just nonsense fanfic.
Ive always been the opposite  it was always more interesting to me to invest in a female character because it was so different from what I was used to. I dont think there s anything wrong with picking a character because you want to oggle them either  but I think a lot of dudes only reach for the  to look at her ass huehue  explanation because they think being open about exploring gender differences would get them roasted into infinity. the sad part is  wokes are worse than bros when it comes to shaming men out of owning their vulnerabilities. remember that  masculinity so fragile  hashtag  reminds me of the saying  cant take yes for an answer .
@mungeparty  you ve got a point. heck  I still often gravitate to female characters because they ve got cuter outfits. but at the end of the day I have zero issue with male characters. not to mention no character in a video game ive yet to play actually looks like me or represents my ethnicity  and I dont care. its not about us. if they make a character that looks like us  its a cool and move on situation. at the end of the day it doesnt matter  and I cant believe 20  year olds complain  theres no character the same  sexuality  gender  race  etc  as me!! ill only like a character who matches me the most compared to other characters!  its narcisistic and cringe
interesting I tend to gravitate towards female characters even now because growing up I d be less likely to see myself in them when they invariably died horribly due to my poor skills. even had a period as a kid where I d avoid clothing similar to that worn by people who died in horror movies. though I admit in some games that actually explored gender differences more than avatar I do it to see a different perspective..
@liam warner  when it comes to games with customisation  I typically go for a girl and just glam her the heck out  but in games with already established characters  its who s got the best personality or if their gameplays the most fun tbh.
1 28 signature tomb raider referencealso yes I liked all aj tomb raider movies  thats peak aj
my guess is the budget either went entirely into licensing  or to pay the people on twitter and rotten tomatoes to defend the show  because itsure isn t going into the quality.
no kid in india that I know of  saw tobey maguire as spiderman and thought  wow  I wish he was brown.most of them looked at their fingertips  wished there were spikes there and then tried to climb walls
also  how is nobody mentioning that the fresh rotten milk felt ripped straight from stranger things  that was the first thing I thought when I saw that.
wait ..there s actual rings of power fans  who knew
rings of power writing vs dark souls writing sometimes to find the light  we must first touch the darkness.   for the curse of life is the curse of want. and so you peer into the fog  in hope of answers.
yeah sadly yes I am. I am afraid all the negativity will get the show cancelled and I am enjoying it. it is just exactly what I like to watch. sigh  instead of being negative cant people just not say anything   I am so insecure.
I can understand them defending it against criticism if they like it  they dont want it to be cancelled changed... what I cant understand is how you can like this show in the first place
you ve probably seen the meme of the seething and crying npc face wearing the flimsy mask of a calm  cool  smug expression. thats who we re dealing with here. people who make cynical corporate entertainment sacrosanct cornerstones of their manic personalities.
its weird how someone would post about something they dont care about. if he simply enjoyed it we d hear about the parts of it that he likes. but no  he decides to focus on the people who didn t like it.
a few games I liked that most people hated  the last of us  part 2 and death stranding. unlike the rings of power fanboys  I completely understand why people hate on them. in fact  its pretty well deserved. didn t stop me from beating both multiple times.
that budget probably went mostly to the production of those glassware xd
I am going to petition for a floof cam!
sometimes to find the light we must first touch the darkness .holy flying fuck  I d bet tolkien would crawl in a corner to hide his embarrassment  if he was alive to witness having something like this associated to his work.
rings of power at this point is the canary in the coal mine and the person holding that canary in hollywood s place is helen keller
when you put a poc into a medieval european fantasy it just looks stupid in its face. its not our fault we have to see through something to make the material look authentic. its not a knock on poc. its a knock on the show creators for not picking the best actors for the job. we know why they were picked.
I love thatsomeone finally said you should be able to admit that an objectionably bad movie you like is objectionably bad. thank you! there are a few movies and book that I like that I can agree with other people s criticism of them. is the main character in the book the forest of hands and teeth a jerk  yes. do characters make unusual decisions that can be frustrating  yes. I dont blame people for giving it two and three star ratings... and it honestly doesnt bother me.
so thats where the  1billion went - cool looking wine cups.
didn t see lenny henry on that list either  and he has been very vocal on the topic of race.
that first meme is literally  I like brand  brand good.
I like the live action mario bros movie  it never occurred to me to pretend like its not bad.
yeah  for me  I really like the milla jovovich resident evil films  even though I know they re objectively not-so-good.
I dont know if this is much of a problem outside of woke political talking points to be honest. normal sane people already act that way  at least in my experience.
when the writer want to change everything from tolkien s source material  everything just goes wrong.
the problem with social media really everybody open its mouth without reasons  when I was little we went renting vhs and if the movie was actually bad it was not a deal at all we were a little disappointed but forgot the day after. now its like its so important to give your thought on some bullshit which is really getting worst everytime now. I hate rings of power I lasted two episodes  but anyways its getting kind of crazy how people get totally crazy about their views on a show or anything really... mesmerizing... Im so very happy Im not on any social media whatsoever !!
I want a mob style show where bezos has the writers and showrunners are brought to him while tied up with him interrogating them mob style trying to find where all the money went
great vid  thanks for the insight and upload! specially loved your shulk video s ! when will you be visiting cape town
just out of curiousity searched what the actors of friends made per episode back in the day. granted it was a sitcom and in a different era of television.. but they made  22.5k per episode or so in season 1. when it was a relatively small thing. by the end they made up to 30x that at the highest echelons of pay. they were fucking millionaires per second episode. here comes amazon s rings of power. billion dollar budget.. and they apparently pay their actors as poorly as they pay their workers - relatively speaking. I would love to make  10k per week. still  it is beyond ludicrous levels of pay given the budget they had.. and they dont even have a lot of them. I suppose it has to do with up-front pay  giving bonuses if they make money. though that is just an assumption on my part. still  no wonder they have a whole heap of no-names  with a couple decently known actors on top. still  they intentionally picked the lowballing actress for galadriel when such a role should pay   100k an episode at minimum in order to have the very best of the best. the cream of the crop. someone who pours their heart and soul into it  both for the payday  for their career and because they love the character. this woman has no idea who galadriel truly is. I have severe doubts she even has any fond memories of the trilogy itself.. because willingly doing galadriel dirty like that is shameful. we all love galadriel and not a single  solitary soul is anywhere near upset thatshe is basically the most powerful person on middle earth  sans the istarI  unlimited  and sauron himself  and a few others. the upset comes from the fact thatshe is powerful and has no flaws to her character that is not portrayed as a  girl power  thing. the mature galadriel is exceedingly powerful  but vulnerable in her own way. just barely resisting the ring that a hobbit is holding right infront of her in his hand like its nothing. but I digress.point I am trying to make here is that part of the reason why the show is so terrible is because they pay for dirt cheap actors and actresses who also read from terrible scripts. if one of the two were good then they could easily have balanced out to be an above average scene. an amazing actor can make shitty writing seem good with proper delivery. few of these actors can. I haven t seen the series too much  but I heard that durin and even disa actually do good performances with terrible scripts. just a shame that the latter is so hell bent on the identity politics  because otherwise she could probably have been remembered as a good part of the show by many.
sometimes to find the light we must first touch the darkness because knowing what the darkness feels like first hand will help narrow down and make your quest for light a lot easier cause you ll explicitly know what not to look for
kingdom hearts infiltrated disneys higher ups and amazon wanted a piece of the cake.
I would love to see the cost breakdown on this show an invoice or something  because I agree its a scam.  money got funneled into some bank accounts instead of into the show.
this is actually the best show Ive seen since breaking bad  and I would even be so bold as to say it may actually be better
have the rings of power fans ever had a game or movie that they liked  knowing it was not the best quality  I know I have  and I for sure dont go around defending it due to anyone who dares to critique it. bottom line to these twitter weirdos  just enjoy the show  and ignore the criticism lol. when one defends a movie  tv show or game so desperately  almost always I begin to think they actually do believe itsucks but they want it to be viewed as good or were let down so they spend all their time trying to convince you to view it in a positive manner.
hey  50k!  rhymes  yeah congratulations melonie  my verbal lara
it took me quite a while to admit that I actually do enjoy twilight movies quite a bit especially as a dude...
celebrate the little things  like durin.
the  relatively  low salaries make sense to me. none of these actors are a selling point. jennifer lawrence got paid  300k for the first hunger games film. she made a name for herself and now makes tens of millions for a role. make it a hit and then you can get the big bucks. the game of thrones cast was making a hell of a lot more per episode by the end than they were at the beginning.
omg im so glad you see what others ignorantly choose to ignore.
feelin you on that kingdom hearts dialog
the show has so many long pauses and blank stares  I just assumed the actors were being paid by the hour!
rings of power  its a thing you can watch.
I ll say if it was that much money. why not an epic battle scene. like how they did in the movies. the only thing I liked was the visual effects looked good. a better storyline and more action. would have been a great show.
true  Imean we know that tom hanks  career peaked with  bachelor party   but some people actually prefer inferior films like  saving private ryan  or  forrest gump.
these little whiney babies dont know that tolkien arranged his story like dominos  pull one piece and every other thing falls apart.

insightful. stunning. brave and beautiful.
now translate to english and marvel at how stupid it actually is
lol
except I dont need to participate in bad behavior to know that its bad. and if Im a good person the moment I do something bad that goodness goes away. all it takes to turn a good person into a bad person is one bad deed. if you touch the darkness you cant claim to be good.
@mamamob  literally yeah  back in the 90s feminists used to call this kind of reasoning  rape apology  but thats none of my business...
tolkien would say  stay as far away from darkness as can be mustered
rop is an alltime show of alltime and probably the best in the history of ever. galadriel is the best and strongest female character anybody can see on screen. already the most legendary series and one tolkien would be in extreme awe of.
@deceiver  lol  lets goooo!!
those are paid helps. know this and know peace.the story is so bad that they need help from  super fans  pre  during and post release
so much of the dialogue in the show almost feels like it was done by aI and not humans. so many things dont feel natural  organic  or even appropriate given the scene.edit  whoop whoop! grats on the 50k
I love a movie called moon zero two. it hasn t aged well  but I love it. I dont care what anyone else thinks about it.
Im really starting to think the show is just one big money laundering scheme lol
just found the channel this chick is such a snack. love the tattoos  you have awesome insight and review
imagine defending rop hahaha
in fairness to the pay of the cast it has nothing to do with the size of the budget. because it entertainment it doesnt really seem fair.the actor that brings in the most interest will be paid the most in the first season.as a business you pay the minimal amount of what they are worth or is deemed acceptable. next season I expect the salaries will drastically change and the leads will get more.despite being the main character I would pay galadriel less than elrond. he is still linked to got
amazon adds aliens nazI zombies and ninjas to the show  also films it on a spaceship! rop fans  Im just glad Im watching Lord of the rings
I dont like it as much as I try but I keep watching because I hope it improves
damn melonies been on a roll let s good instant thumbs up
shouldn t the title be rings of power fan is insecure
my favorite movie of all time isn t highly rated on my own scale. my highest ranking movie isn t even in my top 5 favorites! rankings and favorites dont meet up in my book.ferris bueller s day off is no cinematic sensation  but its my favorite to this day.
their salaries are fairly average. normally when you start show actors get paid this much and then  if show is successful  their pay grows from season to season. if show were to go for 10 seasons  those salaries would grow 10...20...30 times.
the river says the rings of power is garbage and the river never lies.
its like the sphinx from mystery men was one of the writers! lol
my thing is entertainment value good or bad if I can have a great time watching it I like it I have seen some terrible movies like absolute trash wrong choices all the way around but I love to watch them from a pure entertainment sense movies like the room  troll 2 ect are some of these that are in the public conscious that everyone knows are bad but like to watch
I like star trek lower decks somebody like az from healvsbabyface doesnt. which is fine.  God love him .  not as an actual star trek series but as a satire of star trek and I am enough of an old fan to take delight in a satire.  I look forward to each episode.  it give me pleasure so that is all that matters.   are there people who really like rings of power   well  anything is possible.  if there are enjoy it while it lasts.
well  at least this series got one thing correct about galadriel - the c is always right.
self-awareness is drying up  self-obsession is flooding in.
6 is not so bad  it is slightly above average. 1st tr was quite entertaining.
toxic positivityfinally I got a way to describe those tools. thanks
itsure seems like it lol!
@melonie mac go boom  yeah  pretty sure amazon s new spokesmen is the snuggles bear
@melonie mac go boom  cant believe its a 1 billion dollars project looking like that
thanks for the feedback  expect more videos very soon.send a directly message to get your prize from the ongoing giveaway..
if only rings of power had a script... or normal actors... or interesting plot and characters
aragorn never looked like me when I was a kid under 10.
so they hired the least known actors and actresses so they can pay them basically nothing  now we know why the show has a problem with the acting
so the highest paid actor gets  35k an episode    I recently started working as a file clerk at nbcuniversal tv business affairs so I come across these contracts from time to time  and that is pitiful. fun fact  the highest Ive seen so far is well over 10 times that much  totaling  6.5 million for the season
it was like this with star trek discovery too
here is the problem. there are a couple factors at play here. you have the same type of situation you have with star wars fans. you will get a group of fans who will love anything star wars or at least they will say they love it  no matter how bad it is because they think if they dont like something then that means they are no longer star wars fans. they dont understand you can hate everything disney has done with the franchise but still love star wars they believe they are not true fans of star wars unless they embrace everything no matter how bad it is. it is the same thing with rings of power. then you have the group of people who will pretend to like the show and defend it because they think they are not a good leftist if they dont. they think if they criticize the show then they are automatically trump supporters conservatives or they are agreeing with them. so in order to try and convince people they are not aligned with the people they despise they will pretend to love this garbage. so basically  you are 100  correct. they are insecure.
the real amusing bit is that they all say that they enjoy the show but cant give any actual reasons. they ll say it looks good or the music is great  but all they can say when it comes to characters is  the cast is great . um.....and  they can never give reasons why specific characters are good. and ultimately their leading argument for why they enjoy it is  its nice to have a Lord of the rings show . they re so close to admittin that they re just consumers  not fans  but just are not ready to actually say it. and really the funnier part about all this is that they are acting like we re telling them not to like the show. I have yet to see anyone argue that you cant like rings of prime. at best you ll find people like me who say that they ve trained their gag reflex better than I have. nothing wrong with liking bad things so long as you accept that they re bad. but these people wont because they cannot accept that they got played.
they are not fans of said shows  they are activists.  this is why they push so hard.  some want what was ruined  on purpose  others want more of the same woke redos  so are trying to force it to be popular.re
they need to teach civil discourse in schools again.I d love to see them scrap morfydd and bring kate blanchett in for s2. galadriel was never a warrior. she was always more of a mystic or wizard. and the angst  its horrible. she needs to be a serene  aloof  noble  and majestic character.
@meloniemac I just finished ur whole video  but the financial stuff u talked about was true...its probably a scam...but its not that bad lol
natural radio talent. there s a future.
these  fans  do not really like the  entertainment  of the show or shows like it  they like the message so making others watch the propaganda is what is important.
love a good bad show to love.
thats some good coin melonie confirmed to be a khajiit
when I was a little girl my favorite characters were 4 green teenage mutant ninja turtles. they look nothing like me and they re  all male.
if you go through the time and effort of creating a meme about it and posting it on twitter  maybe you and the 2 000 people who liked it do kind of care about the  haters    opinions lol. just saying. I say that because in my personal experience and observation  when someone genuinely doesnt care about something  they will rarely if ever mention it  let alone make a post about it.I also like the first reply to it as well  glad that person could watch and form their own opinions  even if I and large amount if not majority of people personally dislike those movies shows  instead of getting overhyped or overhating them cause of crowd opinion.
the she hulk response has been hilarious. fans of the show have been so fucking bitter about people not liking it
4 58 exactly! such a kh line smh
one of my favorite movies is dark crystal  but there are people who really do not like it  and I can see why people wouldn t. there are a few plot holes that ruin the narrative of the story  and the world itself is probably too strange and different for others. do I slam these people for not liking it  do I tweet about calling them trolls  no! Im mature enough to understand their criticisms as long as they aren t being asses about it! some people just refuse to see that the things they like have flaws in them  even major flaws.
enjoying the fact that Im watching a Lord of the rings series  bruh its lotr in name only these  fans  be funny
what s your industry take on where that money went
@mungeparty  my guess is the executive producers
I know  good leftists  who are on the  bigoted  side of the fanbase for the first time on this one  its a treat to see it. of course they dont actually believe the shit they say all the time anyway so there s no moment of great introspection like you d hope. still good to know there is a shitsmell bad enough to stop them shoveling it into their mouths  so in that regard rings of power is truly revolutionary.
Ive heard a lot of hate from people who haven t even heard about crowd opinion or amazon tomatoes review manipulation. they re just tolkien fans  many highly progressive even  who hate the show because its bad. fans of the show should take the l and enjoy their bad show  antagonizing people with taste or appreciation for the things the show intentionally changed who are having a laugh watching the cringe trainwreck isn t gonna change anyone s mind about the show  it only reflects on the poor character quality of the show s fans.
its not Lord of the rings. end of discussion.
it took them all of 3 episodes to be irrevocably divorces from Lord of the rings canon.... 3 episodes....
3 30 that tweet  simply enjoying the fact that Im watching a Lord of the ring series  is very  very telling on the mindset of these people.first there s the phrasing  note that they dont say they are enjoying the show. what they are enjoying is actually the fact that they are  consuming an branded content   something every fake fan and posers under the sun think is the most important part of being a fan.enjoying the content itself  fuck that  the most important part is that you canthey cantell everyone they are  totly consuming a product from that ip !then comes the second strike  the fact that they will accept anything as good as long as it has been branded with the ip they think it is fashionable to pretend you like.this proves that they are indeed fake fans and posers. they do not care about the ip itself or the actual content of said product  the most important part here is that its  branded content of the thing you are supposed to like .this people are hacks and deserved to be pointed at and laughed out of the room before being fiercely gatekept out of it.
what in the kingdom hearts writing is going on here !  tysm  my first lol for the day  d
6 out of 10 is  objectively bad   I think I have seen that rating system before
the reason they dont like people making fun of stuff they like is because they do like it  but they dont realise its quality is low  thus they take it personally as decying their taste in media as a whole and not just in that instance. I think the first tomb raider was fine  probably yes  about a 6  but as a videogame film it is one of the better ones  for sure. the reply liked ghostbusters 2016 reboot though  in addition to rings of power  wheel of time. that person just has objectively bad taste. they re a perfect consumer.
12 32 dog! instantly made the video 10x better
before finding the light  one must venture into the darkness first. you have to plunge your hand into the darkness and blindly feel the wall before finding the light switch. common sense!
I like it  but I totally get why others wouldn t. maybe she hulk has just permanently lowered the bar for me.
could it be that amazon is lying about the show s budget  or was the money just laundered
top picture  sw sequel fansbottom pic  rings of power fanspam   its the same picture.
there are rings of power fans  do they actually watch it
given the quality of this show I now dread the fact that they have control over my favourite franchise  the stargate franchise.
yeah  without a doubt  this production is going to be investigated for money laundering. there are going to be people picking at it from every angle trying to find out how in the holiest hell this production cost over  1 000 000 000 to make. there s gonna be scapegoating for sure as well. I ll bet there s a lot of regret from people who bragged about the cost. because it does not reflect that in any way from any department.
an objectively bad movie that I enjoy     oxymoron
when people say  just let me enjoy this  all they are really saying is  I want to be ignorant . sure ignorance is bliss  but we all know its not a healthy mindset. how are things to improve  if we just accept mediocrity  reading tolkien as kid gave me higher standards for what I would or wouldn t read and I dont see that as a bad thing because the things I did read were worth reading
I asked my girl why she liked she didn t give me a straight answer just  its progressive  and I asked her if she liked the trilogies she said it was misogyny.
amazon hired the cheapest directors  the cheapest producers  the cheapest actors  morfydd clark who plays the woeful galadriel got paid just  20k per episode! even amazon knew she wasn t worth much!  and the cheapest visuals.  so where has one billion dollars gone  either they are trying to con the viewer or its a huge  money laundering scheme.
money doesnt equal quality. quality equals money
melonImelonie is a household name now.
house of the dragon is an absolutely fantastic t.v series so far....  a lot better than rings of power.
you have to laugh when people say dumb sh t like  kids need to see themselves in our stories ... I was an 80 s kid. my fav shows were things like the thundercats  tmnt  chip n  dale  the mysterious cities of gold... lets just say I was not represented   _   _
I loved tmnt the movie  and my brothers and I each have a favorite turtle  mine was donatello. never once did I think   I wish donatello wasn t a turtle  and looked just like me.  I also watched the gargoyles cartoon  some show about sharks that I can hardly remember  and the  dinosaurs  tv show. there were also shows like  there fresh prince of bel air    the wayans bros    the jamie foxx show  and  the bernie mac show   which I enjoyed  never caring that they were  black shows .
@grotesque head  street sharks
@grotesque head  yup  I loved fresh prince too. jeffrey was my fav character. not once did I think  this would be so much better if everyone was white  lol.
my guilty pleasure is surf ninjas
the real question is  what are they finding so great about it  Im convinced it is some sort of self-brainwash situation.they decided to like it before itstarted  and now they re not allowed to change their minds.
God damn they got underpaid
I love ice cream  its delicious  but the fans ruined it.
just found your channel  great video. where do you find good rop memes
I wish I could like more things. I just cant though. I have expectations  and when they are not met because of ineptitude or lack of caring  Im not going to like it. but taste is what it is. I am a very picky eater  and I wish I wasn t. my point is that I dont try to dislike these shows.
even if they could indeed fit 100 people into each of those ships together with supplies and horses for an extended journey  and it would be extended  first crossing the sea and then a probably several months long march across the land. doesnt matter  500 or 300 on the 3 surviving ships ain t exactly an army  more like an armed expedition.
with a very short call galadriel
they should look on the bright side. if the show ever drops merch they wont have to worry about it being sold out
I agree with much of the critique but I will still watch it and anyone that affects my actual reality doesnt cares whether I like to show or not so I should I be insecure well saidno I am about as insecure as everybody else and painfully self-aware at times
amazon  we value diversity and equality but not all casts are paid equally
the exceedingly huge budget of this show went into everything except the writers  actors  costume design  cgI  choreographers  consultants and directors. had they just funneled a little more money into those few  inconsequential things  the show might be good!
what s your camera setup  its flawless
melonie mac is a 10 10
melonie rocks.
good to see that bezos is treating his actors  just like his warehouse staff. underpaid and overworked.
wow.   thank you feed. you are both gorgeous and smart!
brrrrrooooo I absolutely love her needler gun from halo she s the best
I liked both silent hill movies  both!  and annoyed the hell out of my friend when we saw the first one in the theater with my fanboying. not great movies. second one especially. also gender swapped the main character in the first one  but I know why.
odyssa got paid with infinite amounts of cake. at least thats what she looks like.
they re safe to merchandise  thats only a concern when the source material has integrity in the first place.
I like the old super mario brothers movie and the final fantasy spirits within movies which most people hate  doesnt change my enjoyment of it in the least. I acknowledge all the criticisms people have of both of them and agree with the arguments. but I can still enjoy them as films nonetheless. dont need others to enjoy something
were so insecure that we want lore changed to be closer to the original... oh wait why was it changed in the first place
why are they called fans if they hate the show and do not watch it  did they change the definition of another word again
I like plenty of movies that are objectively .... not good.   but Im not going to argue with anyone who says that val kilmer s movie  spartan  is terrible.  if you think its terrible  thats fine.  I just happen to love it.  to each his own.
waitso this show cost around 60mil per episode and they dont even spend a million on the main cast...  where is all the money going  like I understand now the bad acting  if I would get paid 20k per episode  I too wouldnt care about it and how it ends up looking lol
is there any girl gamers out there anymore that doesnt constantly have their guard up when it comes to playing games ! ! like  some guys just genuinely enjoy being a asset in a friendly manner  and not every dude is trying to get in a attractive gamer girls pants!!! some of the funniest times Ive had is playing with my friend thats female and just enjoying playing games with them. thats it. is there any girls out there thats just normal ! !
the comments  critiques  and arguments over rop is more interesting and entertaining than the actual show.
they just tweet about rings of power that they do not watch it.
question. actually  several questions. what is going boom  how does one go boom  why would one go boom  when is it appropriate to go boom  more importantly  when is it not appropriate to go boom  is going boom something one does by oneself  or can one go boom with others  is going boom a group activity  is itsocially unacceptable to go boom by oneself in the privacy of one s own home  does going boom cause water retention  is going boom covered by most insurance plans  will going boom cause unsightly scarring or bruising  would yourecommend going boom near an open flame
I want to escape the modern world. and the horrors that it contains. we cant do that anymore now because of wokeness! oiy! face palm.
it goes both ways  in all honesty on both sides of the fence everyone is going on about a fictional series that has no negative or positive real life impact  its a way to escape the real world problem is people bring real world politics into a fictional series  if you find it bad stop watching it  why talk about it if you feel that it impacts you negatively unless you secretly enjoy it and dont want to admit it. leave the fans that do enjoy it and move on to something else its thatsimple.
what they dislike is that the  haters  bring up valid points about why the show is bad and they cant refute them. everyone in that village should ve died after mt. doom s eruption. the writers of this show haven t thought about things like that at all.
to sit down. you must first find a chair.
my favorite thing about youtube is finding hot based female commentators who validate my perspective.
the sea says  the rings of power is horrible the sea is always right.
knowing that morfydd is making only 20k an episode  the star of the damn show  should immediately be cause for all the virtue signalers and sjw s to turn their backs on this show....but they wont  because then they d have to admit they were wrong. they hypocrisy train stops for nothing.
I actually lament the fact that Im not braindead enough to like rings of prime... I would love to have a series of the second age. but I cant. its just awful
the budget could be the result of the new zealand dollar
there s plenty of things I enjoy that are not great  and some stuff I know is really good but I just dont enjoy that much. art is not thatsubjective  but what you like is. you liking something does not mean its good. I also criticize stuff I overall like a lot. what we re seeing with rop is the exact thing we saw with the star wars sequels. defenders bashing people for having criticisms cause real fans just love anything put out that legally belongs to the franchise.
love that tomb raider movie.
if people enjoy rop thats perfectly fine but it doesnt follow that everyone should. to this day I haven t heard a single coherent argument as to why this show is good and the points I have heard are all the same - spectacle and visuals. if people think a show is  good  purely on those criteria then it just isn t worth engaging in any meaningful discussion.
the rangs of guy-ladriel power has from the beginning and always will be an embarrassment since the showrunners think they can  improve  tolkien s  outdated work  by making it woke as hell and ignoring his loren! then the show s simps and shills attack the real tolkien fans who dont it and are critiquing it because it has actual problems! it is a fucking joke!
0 47 to paraphrase  enjoy our drivel.
what they re doing with tolkeins work is exactly what happened with halo on paramount they re tearing down old ip s  franchises  and universes with great writing  stories  and characters  and wiping their ass with it all.
i.r.s. needs to audit the show.   billion dollars my butt.
I fell sorry for when those poor rop fans  how few there may be  find out lotr is a catholic work by tolkiens own admission
rings of power fans review-bombed house of the dragon earlier this month.  personally  I found it to be so petty.at the end of the day  I sincerely desire to love all movies and tv shows.  its not unlike how agent mulder says about aliens   I want to believe  .  but itseems like some people assume I want to shit on their preferred content from the start and without provocation.  and I think thats batshit crazy   a waste of a potentially enjoyable entertainment product.
maybe it cost 900 million for the licensing
there are three factions of people in this debate  the people who think the show is utter garbage  the people who think the show is the best thing ever  and the people like myself that enjoy the show and enjoy discussing it with like-minded people but who also think the show has its problems. the thing is  people like myself are getting fed up with social media discussions because we get hate from the first group for even saying the show isn t that bad  and also getting hate from the people who think its the best thing ever for saying the show could be better in the future. thus  most of us are either discussing the show in the rare youtube channels and subreddit posts that aren t polarized or not talking about it at all. as a result  the first group is under the impression everyone loves the show unconditionally and the second group think everyone hates the show. its kinda like with politics  how social media makes everything out to be polarized but over 75  of people have the same overall views and just stay out of heated political discussion.also  how accurate is the website from which these salaries were taken  how does an indian website called hindifact get the actual salaries when nobody else in the world has them  nobody actually checks sources anymore.
I notice the kanjI Godzilla tattoo you have there....
quick question  how do you believe kids seeing themselves in video games as a bad thing ! ! if a young girl started playing tomb raider and related herself to lara croft  would you consider that to be a bad thing ! !
adjusted for inflation the jackson trilogy cost less than this first season has cost  and yet was done way better!!!!
I can imagine the the casting party...ok guys...you are going to bigger than john snow...your fame will reach heights unknown...
I knew exactly was coming. my expectations for this show was very low and when the makers of this show talked about modernising tolkiens world to fit today s world it was clear what they meant. the female characters dominating the men taking control of the narrative whilst the men just discuss . galadriel has been portrayed in exactly the manner of not just a mary sue but a karen . and ilsildur is basically a very minor character which is ridiculous and elrond and celebrimbor just engage in camp discussions . this is not the elrond from peter jacksons correct portrayal   strong   decisive and full of wisdom.  you will see the crap storm when we eventually see sauron
Im pretty sure those  salaries  are fake af
I have heard they are spending  60m per episode  and Im just sitting here asking myself   60m...on what ! !  there s nothing here...they literally just walk from fucking lindonto moria without any horses  carriages  supplies  etc...
gotta love when a show completely ignores the morality of the creator and makes the characters say things they would never say in tolkien s actual work. tolkien didn t believe in doing bad things  even if it was for some short term gain. thats kind of the point. only good can defeat evil. not sort of good. not mostly good but occasionally evil. only good defeats bad.
this tweet reminds me of the bit in the onion s  sony s new piece of shit that doesnt do the Goddamn thing its supposed to  video. guys like  I ll pretty much buy anything I see in an ad  lmao. gonna go die now.
anybody that disagrees with me doesnt like something I like is insecure my opinion is that rings of power is average at best  when thinking the source material behind it almost created the whole fantasy genre and the budget is basically limitless they should ve been able to do better  huge disappointment. difficult not to compare it to the jackson trilogy or the recent house of dragons series.
rings of power has fans
was that an organized thing  thats hilarious..
in fairness  jackson took the wisest elf in middle-earth and turned him into a grumpy old coot who distrusts men and wont let his daughter do what she wants. some fans might not want to admit it but the jackson movies did plenty of damage themselves.
@lodatz  I agree with parts of what you said but elrond had a reason to be grumpy he was betrayed by ilsildur who failed to destroy the ring at mount doom.  and by this time what he said was right   the world of men from that time onwards was leaderless and broken . he didn t trust men anymore   but he was brought back to some hope when he brought ilsildurs broken sword reforged  to aragorn to take his position as the next king of gondor . thought that was quite well portrayed in the trilogy
@spartan300  elrond wasn t betrayed by isildur  though. isildur in the canon is a great hero and a paragon of men. far from some shameful legacy  aragorn carries immense pride at being the heir of isildur and in fact arwen herself falls in love with him because of how much aragorn embodies the greatness of westernesse and how alike he is to his ancient forebears. this is another point that jackson s movies got wrong  and indeed elrond is defined in the lore by how much he is the elf who still trusts in the strength and valor of men. and why shouldn t he  after all  the entire line of numenorean kings  isildur included  are descended from elrond s brother elros  and he loves aragorn as a cherished son. the whole  weakness of men  crap was invented by the movies to justify arwen s role as aragorn s advisor  teaching him to be  better  than the supposedly bad men of the past. its vapid garbage.
@lodatz  I have read the Lord of the rings books several times you know that once the kings of men took the rings sauron made   the world of men fell into chaos as the whole purpose of these rings was to divide and conquer   manipulating men against each other .you know what happened to the numenorians and  you know who the black numenorians are and the origins of the easterlings. and you probably know thatseveral of the nazgul or ring wraiths were black numenorians . are youreally saying the world of men was not leaderless and divided by the time the events of Lord of the rings started   that was the whole point of the kings taking the rings in that they were tricked knowing they had lust for power  and then  eventually  falling  into darkness . why is it the elven kings didnt wear the rings     what you are referring to mainly is the history of the second age we are now referring to the third age . peter jacksons movie was very close to the lore of the Lord of the rings books  the hobbit movies deviated a lot .
@spartan300   I have read the Lord of the rings books several times then you should understand and agree that elrond was not portrayed within the book the way he was erroneously portrayed in jackson s movies. in the book  elrond is the wisest elf in middle-earth  with a deep affection for men and of course a kinship with the line of numenor. he loves aragorn as a son  and toils for years in preparation for the war of the ring which will make or break isildur s line once and for all. he is not against aragorn s wedding of arwen in any sense other than it will result in losing his daughter when he leaves middle-earth for aman  and thus he sets the price of her hand at no less than the realized king of men. in the movies he is a grumpy old coot who distrusts men on a racial level  and who wont let his daughter do as she wants.  are youreally saying the world of men was not leaderless and divided doesnt matter if it was  because tolkien s version of elrond didn t distrust men and didn t see them as hopeless  regardless of how leaderless and divided they were  and certainly didn t need gandalf lecturing him to make him believe in the quality of aragorn  whom was raised by elrond as a son.  that was the whole point of the kings taking the rings in that they were tricked knowing they had lust for power says who  there is no suggestion from the books that men were seduced by a lust for power  any more than the dwarves were seduced by greed. what happened is that the elves became aware of sauron s plan to rule them through rings of power  hid the three from him and tried to destroy the rest. sauron captured the other rings and gave them out himself to seven Lords among the dwarves and nine kings among men  who of course had no idea what the rings were actually designed to do. the only reason he didn t give any more to the elves is because they knew what he was up to. again  youre inserting stuff created by jackson in order to justify jackson s choices. this does not come from tolkien himself. peter jacksons movie was very close to the lore of the Lord of the rings books not anywhere near as much as itshould have been  and certainly not in the case of the portrayal of elrond  aragorn  and the legacy of isildur. all of that was changed by fran and phillipa to suit their expansion of arwen. I say again  the jackson movies did plenty of damage themselves  even if some fans wont admit it.
honestly it wishes it was average.... the only thing thats even remotely acceptable is the production values  anything the writing touches has already turned to ash.
the first tomb raider movie was not bad. a bit campy and corny  but thats part of the charm of those older movies.
Im probably in the minority here but I dont think rings of power is as much of a dumpster fire as its made out to be. there s alot left to be desired  sure  but I dont think its writing is as bad as she-hulk  for instance. I also didn t follow any of the marketing for the show  so I didn t know it was being pitched as some kind of  woke  property or whatever. it just seems like an almost average story written in the lotr universe  with very few  epic  moments. there are a couple cool scenes  but the original lotr trilogy was just so so so much better. thatsaid  people who dont like are certainly free to voice their concerns and problems with the show  because honestly  thats the only way that things get better. if people dont like a movie  or a show  or a game  shutting up about it is the worst thing you can do because then you cant expect that property to ever improve in quality.
that pay cant be real
the 90s live action Lord of the rings show was objectively bad  but its proust compared to the amazon show. fans were never considered toxic back in the 20th century  everyone accepted the fact that films are generally imperfect and a lot of them miss the mark. please watch greystoke  the legend of tarzan featuring bo derek and then tell me Im trolling when I critique it. every aspect of a movie has to be done flawlessly to make it a great work and a lot of productions struggle with the synergy of accomplishing that. in this new show they have an amateur cast  re-used sets from got  teen writers and forgettable music. the fight choreography is terrible. the costumes look like they re from an episode of star trek next generation. the budget apparently went to nose candy and executive hotel bills  including the minI bar and x-rated movies  plus they ate the toblerone
I liked the aj tomb raider movies but I liked the green lantern   ryan reynolds movie so Im a bad critic.
I love the show!!!!
my wife and I are both huge tokien fans  I think she put it well.  the show has no heart.   when yourealize that the fate of the world rested in the hands of not great warriors and wizards  but in a hobbit.    the return of the 4 hobbits to the shire also hit me so hard and deep.  nothing in this series effects me at all and I dont see a reason to care for any of the characters at all.   the elves appear to just be humans with pointy ears  not the mythical beings portrayed in the novels or movies.
where the hell is all that money going   it damned sure isn t the cgi.
this is highly disingenuous.  pay doesnt mean they are getting paid less  the main characters generally get merchandising royalties too . which would also mean the black dwarf would be mass-produced as will guyladriael. the rest of the cast usually dont get many merchandising royalties.
exactly people like it then why do other people need to like  I get knocked on for not liking a few things  but thats something I just dont get.
one side says  I dont like the show. . the other side says  I dont like the people that dont like the show. . nobody said  I dont like the people that like the show. . there was a response of  I dont like the people that dont like the people that dont like the show.   but that was because the second demographic began to insult the first.admitedly  there might have been a little  I dont like the people that made the show  because they did something disrespectful towards something that I love and the reason for the badness of the show are actions taken for reasons other than making the show good. . but I dont think that is enough for the amount of the second category  which is the more toxic in my oppinion.
also.. if this series would reflect their view of the modern world they really must hate the irish.
me- white  brown hair  bookworm. who is my favorite disney princess  mulan. but she isn t a physical representation of me
Im just tired of people dismissing legitimate criticism by calling anyone who doesnt like something racist sexist etc
ahh  the smell of freshly laundered money.
I read watchmen and I loved it  I watched the movie and I actually liked the movie more. one thing though is they kept true to the core characters and the general arc. no gender swapping  no race baiting bs. just a change to the ending which I actually prefer to the graphic novels  that was an adaptation well done. the rings of power on the other hand  is taking the Bible and making Jesus a black wahmen  matthew and mark and having a gay affair and the devil the good guy. plus lets also add in some extra characters and just mix old testament with the new testament. now I dont like the Bible but its still an original ip and every single ip should stay as it were as the characters etc are there for a specific reason. its not a subway where you build your own sandwich from the selection of ingredients  its a gourmet meal that is already prepared..
these days everyone thinks they know everything about the show they didn t  supposedly  didn t like after one episode lolI love how people call shows a series before the first season is even over lol to make a series you need multiple seasons before its a series which no show reaches past 2 or 3 seasons lol they are shows
10 58 - maybe those ships carry men and horses like my inventory in gta5.
angelina s tomb raider was better than the remake thatshouldn t have ever been made
so much more equal pay
this is true but the problem with this argument is that the people who need to hear it are narcissists who cant tell the difference. if you experience extreme pandering in your favor as an environment of oppression against you  there s already zero self awareness.
you love how you dont know what a series is.
the Lord of the rings is the second best selling book series in history behind the Bible. world. wide. it is currently in print in 38 languages  and has been printed in as many as 70... and thats as tolkien wrote ityeah  the only people who  need to see themselves  are 30  year old twitter  activists  who think their  identity  is a substitute for the personality they gave up on.... everybody else seems to have no problem identifying with the characters and the world tolkien createdand anybody who needs to tell you how much they dont care about how many people hate what they claim to like.... cares deeply. I unshamedly love the 1980 s flash gordon movie  in no small part because of how shamelessly terrible it is.... I dont need to tell the world their opinion doesnt bother me.
insipid. thats a pretty good description of trop. its just lacking anything remotely resembling an interest in the source material. its like a cup of tim horton s coffe. totally lacking anything resembling flavour.youre welcome.
this show has to be a tax scam or something similar.
george lucas is on record for saying  special effects without a story is a pretty boring thing . well... the amount of work generated in this show is impressive. but  ultimately  the show is still boring.
they know the show is trash.. which is why they need other people to reinforce they re psychosis.one of my favorite movies is grease 2. I dont care what other people say or the bad the reviews.. I love it. Im telling you they know the show is bad  but denial is mufuka.
I simply cant watch a show that twists the lore  especially lotr. I ll focus on hot d.
the cartoon network adaptation of firebreather is objectively bad. the adaptation ignores the key part of the ip. the cg is marginal. I still love it and watch it from time to time...
how are there  fans  of this show  when it is brand new liking a show 5 episodes in  doesnt make somebody a  fan.
Ive always loved the dwarves in any incarnayion of a middle-earth story  and the dwarves in rings of power are no different. arondir is probably the only elf in the entire series that I actually care to watch. also  halbrand  elendil and isildur are the only humans I dont want to see thriwn to a balrog.
looks like it is money laundering
despite the bad reviews from lor fans I wanted to like this series. I was craving a fantasy setting show and I had prime so I gave it a shot. I watched the first 2 episodes and it was so fricken boring I went to bed and never looked back. I have limited time to enjoy tv  streaming or otherwise  I refuse to waste it on crap. if you cant hook my interest by the second episode at the very latest Im out.
at least thanks to this show I know how to kill an orc now. stab  twist  gut!! seriously this show is so bad it wouldn t surprise me if it doesnt become a cult classic at some point.
this show... has happy fans
it means so much coming on a woman s mouth. rop is what happens when  to quote a wise guy somewhere on youtube  the show is written by an activist disguised as a writer instead of hiring an actual writer.if amazon truly cares about quality they would ve put the best showrunner on top of it. here they put the no-namers.
amazon executives  cackling    let s do  diversity casting  - we ll be able to pay them less! bwahaha
its not even narcissisms they re breeding by saying that kids  need  to see themselves in stories...its breeding racism in kids and adults. adults see race in everything  adults teach kids to see race in everything. Im far from latin american and as a kid one of my favourite things were the aztecs...pretty certain there was a point where I wanted to be a jaguar warrior. now I do actually support the idea of giving people equal representation in the film and television industries but not for the bullshit reasons these assholes come up with  I want to see firstly fair representation which means equal but Im not pretending its for  the children  realistically without fair representation there s allot of great actors that would otherwise miss out. thatsaid  children do not see race like adults until we teach them to  having  representation  isn t for them they aren t little racists like the adults training them  in one of the world s many paradoxes children are more mature than adults in that way.
I wonder if they are including the amount the spend on the rights to the show as part of their  budget   idk how show budgets are calculated and whether thats normal  but if thats the case  its a little disingenuous  because the amount they spent on getting the rights to the show is insane  so its possible that most of the budget went there and very little would have gone to the show itself. if thats the case  then they at least have an excuse for this piece of crap  but idk. need someone smarter than I to look and find out xd
sometimes to have 50k subscribers  you have to have everyone unsubscribe.
the funniest thing about them calling critics of rings of power  incels   is that they support a show that thinks the only way a woman can be strong is if she s like a man. if your  strong  independent woman  has to be dressed in ironclad armor  wielding a great sword  and slaying men left  right and centre  then I can only assume that they are sexist.
seriously  where did the budget for this go  I dont see 60m per episode here. someone s lining their pockets with an ingenious money laundering scheme in my opinion.
indigenous
@mungeparty  poor form.
sorry to be so politically incorrect about this but  no youre not getting it. its got way more to do with negativity being so ever-present that its actually impinging on us who like it. it comes up in news feeds  even ones that aren t entertainment-related. it gets annoying after awhile when its in one s face unless one actively avoids it.-an anonymous nerd
flat out  the rop is not a lotr series. its just generic  poorly written fantasy wearing its skin. tolkien could power the entire planet with how fast he s spinning in his grave right now.
someone non stop talking about how bad it is -  how dare these people like it   this your take ! !  lololololol
I like rwby. its a terrible train wreck of a show. I watch videos deriding every aspect of it and very offended-ly agree with everything they say.
rings of power fans aren t real lotr fans...
11 15 dead on. not one of those ships can carry a hundred men with no horses or supplies. sure  sure  you could pack 100 men in there and the ship wouldn t sink  but they would not have any place to sleep  for example. ok  its a warship  so I guess they make do. sleep in shifts  deal with it  we re going to war.but where do they put the horses and supplies   when you look at the episode from 9 29  itshows the interior cabin with men sleeping in hammocks and some just on the floor  no space in there for more than 30 or 40 men as a generous guess  then a guy goes outside and galadriel s first comment is  aren t all soldiers supposed to be sleeping   no you stupid elf  there s not enough room for us to all sleep! then the guy goes into the stable on the ship where we see horses in normal stable stalls. this ship doesnt have two cabins. where are those stalls   now add food and water for the men and their horses for a voyage we know to be at least 3-4 weeks and stow their armor and weapons  plus additional food and supplies to sustain them in their military campaign so they dont start starving on day one. where is it all   finally  they have so much extra food that one of the main characters throws a perfectly good mostly-uneaten apple overboard for no reason at all. thats something nobody would do if they re struggling on limited rations due to limited storage space. these are tardis ships. obviously.
the problem with people who like this show and also say they like tolkien s work  is the amount of mental gymnastics they have to do in order to correlate outright breakage of lore.I will not say that people who like it are dumb  but  they are being strung along by nice music and vistas. other than that there is no substance to this show. is a corporate soulless cash grab - and its failing at that even.
thanx  4 the gfuel code !
there s no Lord of the rings series here. just a dungeon and dragons ripoff with middle-earth decorations..and  you know  the star wars prequel trilogy dialogue doesnt seem so bad anymore... ..anyway  speaking of the actors  Im not really blaming them  especially considering what they have to work with. Imean  they re dealing with people who honestly believe they can write better than tolkien... is there a medical term for that condition
I wonder if there s something else going on like money laundering or evading taxes going on. cause the cast isn t getting paid  the cgI isn t  the armorers aren t  where is the money going !
my feelings on the show are indifference. why would anyone ever watch the history of middle earth told by people who dont possess the rights to the silmarillion  its just thatsimple  you dont have the right to tell me this story.
there is nothing I identify with in  soul.  yet I enjoyed it. representation is a lie.
I would rather watch blazing saddles. fans    there was one
I suspected early on that the majority of the budget was going towards the rights to the tolken estate.  what Ive been trying to get my head around is  why pay all that money for the rights then write a story that is unrecognizable to the lore. youre not even using what you have paid for.
angelina tomb raiders are great guilty pleasures  the best tr movies period.
how arrogant does this series have to be to think they can add something by making changes to literally the most influential and beloved work of modern fiction. tolkien s body of work literally wrote the rulebook for modern fantasy. also for a tv actor  10 000 per episode is complete fucking shit pay.
the thing about people  hating  on these ip s that the corporations know but cannot admit is this...none of these  haters  want to do this.  people who love star wars want to say new star wars shows are awesome.  marvel fans want to gush about marvel movies and shows. lotr fans who all dressed up like characters back in the day to see the lotr s movies want to love a new lotr movie.for people who are total fans of your product to dump all over it is an indictment of the people putting it out  not the  fans .  you basically blew a lay up.  all you had to do was not make it all woke and political and they all would have made you billions. but nope  could not just give the fans what they wanted  they had to impose the new 2022 agenda on this stuff and insult everyone.  then they act all offended that people do not like it   like no one told them not to do this   yeah  people told them  they did not care because their agenda was more important to them. they just hoped you would take it and accept it.
bad reboot trashes tolkien  just let people enjoy things..... okay  how about I come over to your place  squat on your front lawn  and take a steamer while sayin  just let people enjoy things  ..... ah  no! heyllllll  nooooo.
this series is the anti-tolkien.valinor  the land of good  now has envy and bullying.galadriel  the wisest and most beautiful lady  is now a foolish pseudo-warrior.the good that we must do every day is now the evil that we need to know in order to find the good.virtuous men are now weak and cowardly.mythology for the united kingdom. now its a mythology of the world.respect for tradition ends. now welcome to modernism.honestly  anyone who is a fan of tolkien and doesnt reject this series  is because they were never a fan of tolkien. the series denies everything tolkien wrote.
think amazon is promising goods to the fans that defend the show  wouldn t surprise me.
cause they wanted to propaganda the message.they dont care about tolkein lore or anytrhing. I never saw it and never will. I love the peter jackson movies and tolkeins books.
they paid solely for the name.
well  tweeting about that you like it while everyone hates it  doesnt really scream for validation  but instead of just putting his own opinion out there regardless of what others think.  the first tweet Imean  I could say that your video itself is screaming for validation because you are looking for validation of your own opinion by putting it out in the internet. its not really a good argument to just invalidate someone s opinion because it is different than your own and calling them unaware of themselves.just stick to the material and mock that  there is plenty to mock. but dont have a go at the fans  or as a fan dont have a go at the critics.
avengers  endgame has its haters and none of the fans care enough about it to try  owning  them. why  because it was a massive success and there is nothing to defend.I love the 2003 hulk movie. it got shit on for many years  and then just forgotten  after the mcu started. was that annoying  yes  because itsucks to be the odd person out sometimes.rop  fans  are what I would be right now if I was still pissed about 2003 hulk  eating sour grapes. they know the show already has a shit legacy  they disagree with it  and they re mad.they re going to get even angrier when halbrand is revealed as sauron. lol
those salaries are pathetic. no wonder amazon couldn t get decent actors
this is nothing in the same level of writing talent as tolkien. not even on the same scale.  to compare this writing of rings of power to tolkien s as a continuation of tolkien is highly offensive. its like george lucas writing the original star wars  and then someone decades later tries to say space balls is a continuation of lucas s fine and artful work.  its a joke. hope they lose enough money to go away forever.
I watch micheal bay transformers for fun  are they the best  no. do others hate them  oh yeah. doesnt ruin it for me
if you like this show  thats awesome  I wish I liked it too! I get no joy disliking this awful show. but to say its tolkiens best work- or its faithful to his books ect. is absolute bullshit.
I .. well ... 80  agree.taste does not equal quality! thats a fact.however  youre argument can be turned around 180 .if you enjoy a show and so called fans  even before the show started  do everything to make the show stop you have to act. you have to defend what you like from selfentitled people who consider themself and their opinion more important then the joy time of other people. if you dont like something  dont watch it. I really liked john wick. saw the second movie and though its complete garbade so I didn t watched the thrid and sure as hell are not going to watch the 4th.I dont watch she-hulk nor any new star wars nor rings of power as well.on the other hand if you dont speak up against so called fans  they will soon dictate what show will run and how and when and what should be in the show.no thanks.looking back the best thing that happened in the comic scene was a new generation of writers who completely turned everything upside down. no one would give a shit about wolverine if not for frank miller. same goes for Christopher clairmont  todd macfarelane  len wein and so many others who renewed the old material. people complain about zack snyders superman  I love it. sometimes they screw up  sure. get over it!this goes especially for so called  tolkien aka Lord of the rings  fans that are not even completely delusional about the said work but in most cases lack knowledge to evaluate the work properly and therfore simple voice their taste which they understand as quality. the matter to the fact is  the Lord of the rings is objectively bad ..... very bad. its not a good book. it doesnt even bring much new content or ideas to the table since tolkien took 60-70  of what the Lord of the rings is from various sources of european mythology and history .... and no  he was not inspired by it he did copy-and-paste the material.so in conclusion tolkien himself did what so called fans complain about in the rings of power show.personally  I dont give a fuck about any of this. I stick to what I like and I dont care what tag is put on that and if I dont ike something it can wear my most beloved franchise tag of all time I will still not like it. I guess thats probably the difference between a fan and obsession.
there s no way those salary numbers are even remotely accurate. then again  this show shouldn t even exist either...
the fact the only thing I know about the series is there s a lot of people I see hating on it and the people defending it are more or less just being youre just a sjw hater. thats all I need to know to know its bad. nothing at all about what the storyline is. same with she hulk. I want to like it  but forcing telling you to accept a woman is badass and likable simply because men suck is just ..no. do it right and its a non issue. look at someone like gina carano in the mandalorian. it all comes organically
I like the three stooges. I like the Lord of the rings.  I dont want to see the three of them mixed and if you mix them thats the rings of power.
rings of power is a lotr series mac  thats not really up for debateits literally in the title  set in middle earth a bunch of the characters and lore and locations etc
you dont need validation that you dislike the show....  I think you neglect to realize that your reasoning works both ways...  if you dont like it  you can stop watching it and move along.  d
facts
you dont see the nfl saying  take that  betas
you dont do the  like   subscribe  stuff at the beginning of your video. it makes me physically ill hearing that over and over again on youtube.I liked and subscribed because of that and good stuff.
@meloniemac not only you...but a bunch of other youtubers r on this hate train algorithm on rop....but there s alot worse shows...like ms marvel  star trek discovery....but Im going to make a prediction...that you will probably make a video in the future saying picard s3 actually looks good...but u should hate on dcs naomI cw show instead Im just saying
can you point to the spot in the darkness where the light touched you eeewww ...amazon creeperboom
people can like whatever they want. Im never going to say that they cant. but people also like keeping up with the kardashians  jersey shore  and ghost busters 2016  theoretically anyway . sometimes youre enjoyment isn t an indication of the entertainment s quality  its just a reflection of your poor taste and low standards.
I enjoy  the hobbit trilogy and I know there not great by any means
ringdom hearts re chain of power
I liked 2003 hulk too. art is subjective and a project isn t for everyone. for example  I have no desire to watch another fast and furious movie but it makes a ton of money. it has a fan base and I am not in that camp. rop isn t resonating with most of its core  built in  fan base and that is a problem.
@ron crudup  yeah  when something continues to be viable  you cant really expect to be listened to when you feel some type of way about it. when it fails miserably  only a true narcissist is going to deny that you have a point.
your 100  right . no way is this better than tolkein or faithful at all. I will never even hate watch this trash.
its not up for debate at all.  its most definitely not.  it has nothing to do with tolkien.  isn t based on tolkien in any way and no matter how you label a pile of crap  its still a pile of crap.
nah. they just  borrowed  the names.
in name onlynothing that actually happens in the show has anything even remotely to do with the established lore of tolkien s world. its a slurry of generic fantasy tropes layered over a dumb-as-a-tree-stump plot that is moving as a pace most glaciers are laughing at.
thats definitely what most people are doing.. lol
@mungeparty  not really  each week they are back complaining how much they hate the show like bezos himself came to their house and forced them to watch it. who would have thought a show that is based on the apendixes of lotr that legally  cannot directly use anything from the silmarillion would not be tolkien enough for people  its almost like they warned everyone before hand with the limited material the tolkien estate allowed them to use.I think it would make more sense if people were angry at the tolkien estate for not allowing people to adapt the silmarillion.
@subculturenz  nothing you said is proof that the average person is coming back to watch it week by week.and believe me  nobody s mad that amazon isn t butchering the silmilarillion to this extent. the only saving grace of this show is that its so divorced from actual Lord of the rings it can  and will  be happily forgotten as soon as its cancelled  without any lasting damage done to the source material.
@subculturenz  the spectacle of wasting a billion dollars on a production fans dont like and then antagonizing them is obviously going to draw a crowd  that has nothing to do with the poor quality of the show. Im interested in ongoing reviews and updates because at this point its unclear just how unhinged the fans and showrunners and corporations behind this abomination are gonna get  every week they clown themselves more and more digging deeper. cant blame the  haters  if the clown show surrounding the series is more interesting than the show. maybe if people want to be left alone they should stop lashing out and making a ridiculous spectacle of themselves.
@petrie w  there is enough proof of the average person on youtube making complain a lot of videos while crying how bad it is and still watching and then saying it didn t happen like this in the silmarillion... well guess what  its because no one will ever get the rights to the silmarillion. tolkien estate even hates peter jacksons adaptation of lotr and this is what most of these people also trying set standards to when even the tolkien and his family found itsacrilege. why are you still watching it  petrie
killer klownz from outer space. its bad  but Ive watched   enjoyed it every halloween for over 20 years
I liked the mario movie. yeah  I said it.
when did 6 10 become bad  I agree tomb raider is a 6 10 but thats slightly above average not bad lol
1. angry teenaged galadriel is gonna get super smashed by halbrand  sauron 2. young gandalf is gonna come out of his dmt trip to let that dipsht lenny henry know harfoots arw actually hobbits3. adar  maglor  gonna tell us that not only do the rocks and roads no longer believe them but he found out the sky and clouds dont either...
consume product and get excited for next product.
this show literally has to be money laundering  the actors aren t even getting paid that much
jeff bezos really needs to audit thatseries cause he has been ripped off. there s no way that a show that bad should have cost a billion dollars. some put money in there pocket or over charged on a lot of stuff and bunch of people pocketed money. I could of made a better Lords of the rings show for a billion dollars and I dont even know how to make shows but with billion dollars I d find those who did.
I think the people who defend this are not going to rewatch this over and over again.  this is like the last jedI cope.  oh they were doing something different... that ppl watched only once.
rings of boredom
the fans are actually aware the show is shit. you cantell because they spend zero time defending it  they never elaborate on exactly what they enjoy about it  about what the show is doing right. they have no list. they just disagree. the haters meanwhile have a gymongous list of wtf the show is doing wrong.and  60 million an episode! where is the money going
as for where all the money went  well all those fake reviews and  super-fans  dont come cheap.
there was a movie called the pest starring john leguizamo. its fucking terrible. and I love it. do these jeans make my ass look fat   no. your fat ass makes your ass look fat.
melonie I beg you  watch episode 6 of rings of power. please take one for the team
100  some money laundering happened here
I love lotr  books and movies  and I like the show  it isn t for everyone and thats ok  but I find it weird to shit on people for liking something lol
they are paying guyladriel too much imo. a potted plant could do better.  d
heresy eventually perishes after its lies are made naked and clear upon the sight of those it hopes to blind!
Im tired too....
fyI starship troopers is the greatest film ever made.
how the fukk is the star of this show not the highest paid  her agent should be fired
its definitely not good but I liked it too haha
fiiiine
@melonie mac go boom  may God have mercy on your sanity....
I liked it.
oh really  I haven t noticed.
I think most of the budget goes for marketing and cgi. nothing feels natural in the show  most of it is green screen
if they want to watch a stunning and brave movie  then watch frankenhooker.
@meloniemac what s weird is all this hate for rop which is an ok entertaining show with some corny scenes at time   but what show 1st season doesnt ...you know what s woke and really bad  msmarvel   picard
when the show sucks  and they know it  but the message is all-important  this happens.
step 1  get drunk.step 2  take a thought you think is really profound and write it down.step 3  get sober.step 4  re-read the  profound  statement you wrote while drunk.step 5  realize how stupid you are.it ll change your life.
12 31 dog!
like how I dont need validation for liking ralph bakshI s animated Lord of the rings feel free to roast me for that  btw.
they shouldn t be ashamed to like it  Imean twilight was huge and everyone agreed itsucked
I almost exclusively like bad sci-fI shows.
what the fuck  I am betting on my liver and spine that they spent at least 50  on the marketing alone and another 30  on cgI  that would explain why they got so little money. in my country they put posters in public toilets  you cant be more desperate than that
you have not seen what she has seen.
lol
if you like something you should just enjoy it.  ye dinna  need to justify yerself or convince others.
is the attraction between male and female normal
fans of this show   there is no real fanbase  just a few shills. no flood of videos  reactions  gathering  fanfic etc. as there is for truly popular shows  not even normies like thatshow.
people are calling your valid criticisms of topics  hit pieces   thought you d get a laugh from that
and thats why I ll never watch this show ever.sounds as if there very insecure about themselves.if all they have to do is hurl insults at people if they dont like your opinion.
wow!!  20k an episode for galadriel  surely they could have found a way better actress  with more than one scowling face  for that money!!!!
Im not gonna lie   I like she hulk.but  at the same time I agree  that its bad lol
yup
well  there is a simple reason why they must defend a show they like  the show will get cancelled.so its quite logic. what s illogical is looking this garbage in the first place
based
slagged off kingdom hearts. thats an automatic like
its a show mainly for helen keller.
hey sister  miss your talks on scripture.  what happened
there are a few recent movies that find highly enjoyable  yet I know that most people hate them  and guess what     it doesnt affect my enjoyment of these films at all!  I dont understand why so many people need the gratification of other people in order to feel good about liking something...btw  here are some of those movies that I like  and know most people hate...the mummy 2017  king arthor  legend of the swordwarcrafthansel   gretel  witch hunters
atbd I read that exact review. many times. it is a bot review.
so based on what guyladriel said if I dont like the show she ll stop doing it. deal.
have u realized that all the  good  there behavior is evil  and those who should be the bad guys r more likely
we re all scientists and scholars  apparently. even the people that watch only rom coms all day and never read a comic have valid opinions in sci-fI or fantasy.  s
rop fans this show has fans
lmfao
this show has fans
its like so insane how low pay those actors are and yet how budget this dumb show looks for 1 billion dollars.  how is this possible
yeah  still waiting for a  Lord of the rings  series...  even by the series s own standards  it isn t actually Lord of the rings. u.u
50k
name of outro song
if that first guy really didn t care about the negative reviews etc he wouldn t even bother to post that poor attempt of a meme.the mere fact he posts that on twatter shows it pisses him off a lot and he actually knows the show sux.
what they get depends on they re demanding from previous work. robert downy jr only got  500 000 for iron man.
these are people paid to make accounts and post this stuff.  I guess we see where the 500m went because it did not go to cgI  writing or the story.
just...
these lotr fake fans are suffering from gdd  grandiose delusional disorder
looking at those salaries  where was the equality of outcome there  that no matter what they got paid it all sucked anyway
fan s
12 57 puppy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111
where is your butter
these people cant even meme so the fact they think they  own  fans is hilarious.
itseems bezos saved a lot of     on unknown actors wages  costumes  cgI   below amateur level writers which begs the question... wt actual f did they spend their billion dollar budget on    its literally the worst televion show ever created!
its not about being insecure for the company. fans  sure. in business  it doesnt work like that. you never accept defeat. you need to make strategies like what amazon is doing. telling people to ignore the critics  that they can enjoy the show if they ignore crazy fans of lotr  and that will work on some people. its like propaganda. its called bad business and you are trying to save it with drastic measures.
where did that budget go  it didn t go into the writing  the casting  the direction. show me the money.
no one takes responsibility anymore for what the create being a failure. instead they blame it on the fans or men or both. they name call people and say if you dont like the show or movie then ur a bigot or hate woman or both plus a lot of other buzzwords. in order to create amazing and great shows or movies and interesting character you need to have imagination and that is something ur not allowed to have when ur apart of the cult ideology. when you have to tow the line and agree 100  or else ull be called a bunch of buzzword names and cancelled or have ur life destroyed there is no room for imagination. you have to be able to freely think and explore to have imagination and the cult ideology doesnt allow for that at all cause then people might think for themselves and realize the ideology they ve been pushing and forcing on everyone is wrong and hateful.
you know  with all of these big production companies spending so much money on failing shows and movies and other forms of entertainment  what if... and this is just speculation with no evidence or idea about how production finance economics works but... what if these are money laundering schemes .. dump all your money into  assets  to produce a worthless product that way your money is off the books... someone with more knowledge background experience on these concepts should chime in.
hey  you wanna do some gaming with me ! ! just so you know  I understand if you did  that doesnt mean you like me or youre flirting with me    I need some more gaming friends
rop fans just want everyone to leave their feminist manifesto alone.
youre so pretty.
in this era where the color of the casts flesh can affect the score of the flick  reviews mean absolutely dog shit to me.
yes I liked female ghostbusters.... it was terrible compared to og... and pretyy stupid. but it was funy to me  and the glowing cgI looked insanely good on oled tv. I get the hate but I liked it
my dislike of a show shouldn t effect someone liking the show.  I dont care if you like it  so why should you care if I dont like it
marva is sauron
insecure   narcissistic
yes. yes. yes. but all we feminists want to do is give the source material a nice updated trim. especially in the pp.
its such an awful show and I really think people only pretend to like it because they think they have to send a msg by watching it. its so bad
it really is a terrible show. if they had kept galadriel a magic user it would be more believable as a tolkien story.
honestly trop is trash but if someone is legitimately sitting down and enjoying the show while literally ignoring everything online then good for them  but if you have to tell someone youre ignoring them and act like its an own  then youre not ignoring them and you actually playing yourself
said it before and I ll say it again  when this series clearly stated they were not adhering to this especially beloved canon  and went out of their way to alter said canon  and also fired their lore officer once he started doing his job and immediately slapped him with a nda  I knew I d never watch this thing. oh  and hey! if amazon is so woke  why is morfydd clark making  10k less than the actor playing fake elrond ! so much for  wage equality   eh  I couldn t have cared less about black people playing dwarves and elves...if it were an original series. morfydd clark being really pretty is about the only positive thing I can say about  rings of power  so far.
30k per episode is really good  thats 240k for the lot you think these actors are worth more than that  they re not even a listers
I find it hilarious that the most inclusive show. which reflects our world in tolkiens.  that there is a gender pay gap.  no equality behind the scenes. hahaha
they could had an aI write better material. this show is completely hollow when compared to tolkien s imagination.
thatstupid tweet in the beginning says it all... all virtue signaling  no arguments based on facts about the show they chill for.its only  I dont care about facts  I dont care about content  I dont care about lore... I just care about hating fans with opinions I dont share and put out my statement that I dont care about anything but chilling for propaganda.
sheeesh
if you need validation for liking something then maybe you should reconsider your taste in shows. when you have to tell the world that you dont care what anyone thinks about something you do in your own private time then your should learn to stop telling on yourself.
she make 10k less than elrond    were are the feminist    haha
if the woke weirdos liked something I liked  I would have to question what I am watching.
rop is not a Lord of the rings series!!! it is uses   abuses elements of the silmarillion which are external to the Lord of the rings and occur thousands of years before.
seen or commented on any good shows like cyberpunk  or this is just another channel hating on shows regularly instead of just not wanting it...
its all shine and no substance. like junk food. it tastes good on the service but makes you feel like crap afterward. thats modern entertainment. thats rings of power.
yeah
geez  these people are hilarious. say you dont care about the review or complaints but put in the effort to spill your guts on twitter  right. like what you like whatever  good for you. remember no one invite you to this  party . this is the equivalent of you letting yourself into a party and now yelling loudly for attention.
are you guys sick of her shoe horning tomb raider into everything yet I dont presume jeremy s audience are big tr fans
everyone got paid a good amount
I want to like it but its just so boring.  after 5 episodes I should be invested in the main characters but im not.
the whole show is just. . . a disappointment. lotr should be an amazing thing that rakes in the fans and money. but so far this show they  have created is just sad and pathetic.
me watching the Lord of the rings show..  its not a Lord of the rings show! tolkien never would or could write such trash as is the rings of power  total and utter faeces.
your money-concerning questions are nonsensical in this big money laundering case.
morfydd clark only getting 20k kinda pisses me off. pretentious virtue signaling  but still have an unfair wage. at least its consistent with amazon.
she hulk is bad but more entertaining than rings of power  as cringe as she hulk is  I still watch...I watch rings  but its more like being fascinated by a car crash on the highway...like I freaking love the outpost  but I know its a cheesey low budget fantasy show shot in some weird eastern european country... but I dont care it has action and hot women and bad cgI demons
I always find it quite pathetic when people feel like they need validation for something they enjoy.I like a lot of media that perhaps most do not  like dune 1984   but its really no bother. who cares if people disagree  grow up a bit.
hey! Im insecure and I dont like rings of shit. quit insulting my kind.
angelina jolie was a good looking laura croft its just the writing sucked
ring of power is a bs show  deal with it.
are you serious  you think 6 outta 10 means a bad movie  what a harsh rating system you have. 6 10 has always meant  above average . bad is really 5 and under and you are giving the 1st tomb raider film a 6. thats odd.
if what youre watching aint that great if you need to clown the ppl who dont like it  what does thatsay about the ppl  you  who are clowning the ppl clowning the ppl who are clowning the show
all three tomb raider movies were good and I watch she hulk who cares what the cry babies think.
bottom line is the show has terrible writing.
were all rassists
what about the representation  wont anyone think of the racist children !
I never read the books so no clue how badly they re getting butchered but the show is not very good. its watchable but boring with crappy characters and shit choreography. wtf did they spend so much money on  I think the budget is my biggest problem. if this was a cheap show I would complain less but they had a ton of money and still fumbled it. and jc why must they play that epic sweeping music every 5 minutes. its uncalled for and over done. I get why. the music tells me I should feel something but I just dont and the music just points it out.
lolz  are those srrsly their actuall sallerys    what the actuall fuck    and they talked about wanting to be the next game of thrones  xd hahahahahahawant like sansa-and aria earing like 200 k episode not to mention that the dwarf and kit-earned close to like 1-million episode    it really makes you wonder where the actuall fuck all that money went if not to the actors  xd  its in all honesty pretty disgusting   imagine your future self telling the story of beeing a head lead in the most expensive tv-series ever  and when the kidds ask how much one made you are like ehhh  20k episode  meanwhile every other big series at the time had their actors sitting on 100 k episode hahahhaha  like wtf.
lol the white strong female get paid less than the migrant or the poc weight challenge actrice from the uk
let me guess  we re intimidated by mary sues and frightened of actors of colour and we need to brought to heel
agree!
dont break your back reaching like that lol
it tells me you ve been watching too much ring of power if youre starting to speaking in this level on convoluted nonsense just because you hope is sounds deep to people who dont bother actually reading what you just said....
I think everyone can agree that trailer park boys is objectively bad. terrible acting  cheap sets and locations  definitely ugly actors... still makes me laugh  and I could care less about other people s opinions on it. why is thatso hard for the twatterati
I would like to like it but its too boring.
the show is bad and I dont like it and I still watch but not to enjoy it. I watch it just to pinpoint areas of shitty ideas and performances.
34 days til  halloween
rings of power is just a bad  bad  terribly written show. doesnt matter what your politics are the thing is just bad.
so no white person or black person can watch squid game because we cant see ourselves on thatshow or wait didn t everyone watch squid game so they  thats bullshit.
yes you have the right to like something or not like something Im not going to go out of my way to mouth someone off for liking something that I dont. but there is no debate about them bastardizing someone else s work the rings of power is not the original creators creation this is their own agenda twisting tolkien s work. to me its vandalism if you want to create your own tv show books ect to show your beliefs your agenda then do so dont twist someone else s to suit your shit its thatsimple. people wouldn t like their car keyed right  and most people dont want someone to put graffitI up on their buildings so why would this situation be any different. and dont get me started on the acting and the sword fights good grief for a billion dollar show wtf Im sorry but there s nothing in the show thatshows me its worth billions of dollars.
Imean. the fans of she hulk and rings of power. arent actually fans to say the least. first of they cant me tolkien or even peter jackson adaptation fan either since the entire franchise contradicts everything and theres nothing to compare with. when the comes to the newer whos never sean lotr nor ever knew or read anything tolkien finds the series boring. the same goes for she hulk.  the only fans that remains are the political ideologists which ironically has nothing to do with these two series in the first place. likelyhood the fans are only being fans because it is something people dont like. basically the karens of the world and dare I say some just want to watch the world burn and have a hardon about it.
first off you look so uncomfortable  we really need to get you a new chair. I dont think I would watch if it was free.
insecure and bad at memes
people who dont like this crappy tv show are racists  say the makers of this crappy tv show. how can hating this show be racist if most people s least favorite character is the white blonde with blue eyes  lol. make it make sense.
anyone defending this show is beyond reasonable.  there nothing good on show  characters and story are terrible.  this show has zero to do with Lord of rings series.
its just plain boring  writing is amateurish  direction poor  nothing really happening and the list goes on. bottom line its horrible....nice job mel  best wishes.
rings of power is hot garbage. I watched the first two episodes dont think ill be watching the rest.
this show is so bad idk why amazon still waste money on this crap  the boys is infinite times better
its not anywhere as good as peter jackson s. some bad writing. some feminist stuff. not near as bad as the culture warriors say  and objectively less woke than hotd. and after the actors change in hotd I like rop more
enjoy what!!! I tried  but there is nothing to enjoy in this waste of money... its terrible and an insult to anyone watching... forget tolkien  as a stand alone show its pathetic  I  have seen better writing in the rugrats
nobody cares if somebody likes this trash heap of a show but they cant then turn around and attack actual tolkein fans for calling out what a pos show it is and how far it is from anything tolkien. its objectively awful on every level even if it wasn t supposed to be tolkein and just some generic fantasy. its worse than cw level writing. if people want to like garbage because they attached their personal identity to it rather than it actually being good to thats their problem.
rop suuuuuucks so bad
objectively bad is a product of societal conditioning saying your biases make something good legit apply to everything  just cause theres often a status que doesnt mean these are any less valid tomb raider might be a 10 nothing is objective in art
oh and galadriel is for sure the worst
no  objectively bad is a thing  like when you produce a series with dailogue thats utter nonsense around a plot thats frankly moronic and characters who wish they had a single dimension to cling to.there is objectivity in art. the ideas being presented by it may be subjective  but you can objectively fuck everything up in the presentation with cheap costuming  piss poor casting  and writing so bad it boggles the mind that this thing even got produced in the first placethe argument that there is no objectivity in art is the last fall back of those who know they cant defend the quality of the thing they re defending for some stupid reason  usually completely unconnected to the actual work itself.
empty socjus jargon gibberish. like biting into a mouthful of water  no taste or substance. nobody s buying it.
