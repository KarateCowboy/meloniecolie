I hate how being fat and ugly is supposed to represent feminist empowerment. it is actually very demeaning to tell women to look up to that. for men we are pushed to be jacked and attractive like chris hemsworth and Im 100  fine with that.
I like how people are defending the statue  saying that its okay because its only  40. call me crazy  but if Im spending that much money on merchandise then at bare minimum it needs to look accurate.
well of course they made her ugly. cant have a smart  attractive and strong female characters in 2022 that would be  problematic .
they didn t make lara look like the girl next door  they made her look like the guy next door.
lara croft  looks more like larry croft.
lara became a threat to  the message  the day her pointy polygons first graced the playstation. they ve only become more empowered in the last decade and more so in the last few years.
agreed. with chun-lI  we think about the legs  the hairbuns  the piercing eyes. with samus  its her statuesque height  the sharp  stoic look. every enduring character design came from building a signature that people found so appealing they instantly associate it with the character over time  and for lara croft  thatsignature is in contrast with today s trend of making female characters appear more  ordinary . when I saw the 2013 lara  2018 movie lara  and now this  my first impression was the same   she seems like another person dressed like lara .
holy cow. it doesnt even look female. that face is pure dude. lxrx crxft the non-binary tombraider.
thats horrific.  I never felt bad because lara croft was depicted as a beautiful woman. she was an inspiration to me as a child because of how strong and cool she was. and yeah  she was sexy  but that never made me feel bad about the way I looked. lara is a badass. poor thing.
thatstatue looks more like larry croft than lara croft.
let s make a figurine of one of the hottest  strongest video game characters ever.  ok  give her a derpy face and bushy eyebrows...oh  and fuzzy uggs
I agree with you on every thing. if only I had the money and studied film making a long time ago  I would have put the effort to get rights for this franchise. never ever going to give up on this idea
she s supposed to be kicking butt and taking names. not asking for the manager.
youre right on this one. she is not pretty. it looks like a more feminine ruby rose  take that as you will.Im also just as upset as you at what they ve done to lara. she is one of the most important characters in my world of gaming as well  and I have grown so frustrated over the years at the character they ve turned her into. unrecognizable. and the only answer I can really come up with as to why is  some new-age feminist-activist got their hands on her. my guess being someone at eidos-montr al  for reasons that have nothing at all to do with my reprehensible disdain for trudeauians  aye.  wink give her back!   we shout.
they ve been making lara ugly for ages.she was target number one for these people.
ahh  let the haters hate and like you said we dont have to like every rendition of our favorite characters if we dont want to. we dont have to eat whatever is fed to us just because its the latest thing. this is the difference between real fans and fake.
you gave some good points. definitely with the toy models. especially the lara croft 1 4 scale with the two raptors by weta  the final product was not of the same as the picture shown. they doing lara wrong and cheated us out of our money. and definitely too with the reboots  thats sara broft not lara croft. it took mods  turning point  for the tr 2013 to make her look like herself. I hope they get it right for the next installment.
I appreciate your videos so much and seeing someone who actually makes sense. I just got into an internet argument with some liberal princess who told me that her features are exaggerated because nobody who is fit looks like her in real life. I have friends and family that look like her  Ive seen people who look like her  my own mother looks like her  a lot of girls in my childhood looked like her and some of which didn t even have to actually work out  be fit or anything. you can just simply google her body type to get people who look like her in real life. so I have no idea where in this God forsaken earth she gets the idea that nobody looks like her in real life. and even if its true that nobody looks like her  nobody has a t-rex mantle in their house in real life either. lara fights with t-rexs  fights with atlantian Gods  fights with shapeshifting dragons  fights with giant man eating humanoid mutant spider-like creatures  and eats lions  tigers  and bears for breakfast. so its not supposed to be real life in the first place. there s a good reason it is called fiction which again  is because it is not real life. to me itseems like the liberal leftist princesses who complain about it not being realistic are only complaining because it unrealistic only  for them . and I find it funny how this is never heard of or talked about when it comes to men even when we have characters such as the incredible hulk who is so jacked out of his mind  not even steroids on steroids could ever help a man to look like that. and looking at all the other characters with exaggerated features such as batman  superman  zangief from street fighter  brolly from dragon ball z  etc. compared to all of them  lara croft is as realistic as fictional fantasy can get. Imiss the days when feminism actually made sense when women just wanted to be equal to men abd have the same rights as men. thats the reason we got wonder woman and her features in justice league are every bit as exaggerated as the men in thatshow. but nowadays  feminism is more about coddling the feelings of women who cant stand the sight of other women who are more powerful and have more sex appeal than themselves. I told her to go watch the justice and get back to me only after she has the same complaints about all the men in thatshow as she does lara croft. otherwise  she is just being an insecure hypocrite. please continue talking about this  your work is greatly appreciated.
oh no  why   what have lara done to be hated so much thatshe deserves a statue like that !  there is no statue or action figure out there which is affordable and looks good. Imean she s not like some game protagonist  she s  as melonie said  an icon. she deserves fkn better than this!  thanks  melonie for creating new content. love it!
of course they made her ugly  likely to combat the...uh   male gaze.
I hate how its socially acceptable to tell smokers that its bad for their health  but we cant say the same to overweight people.
@view bot  same!
@view bot  100  agree
@view bot  yep thats true  I never saw or heard this weirdos talk about something so important like that medical experts treat morbid obesity as a disease  these ignorant characters aren t disclosing that much-needed data information.
@view bot  give it a few years and they ll say  its my right to smoke a pack a day into my son s face.
why do you care whats socially acceptable. nothing is stopping you from calling fat people unhealthy. and why would you even want to do that  if people want to live an unhealthy life and rather make excuses than trying to change it thats their own problem and not yours.
true I got quite a few cheap original harley quinn models and the face looks like harley and not a melted wax work of bruce campbell
and  40 isn t that cheap for a figurine or statue. this is something you d expect for  5 at some cheap dollar store poundland type store.
those people defending it probably look like rocky dennis
you can get figures at the dollar store thatstill look attractive.
movements need symbols that advertise and promote them. an ugly  unhealthy self destructive movement would naturally want a symbol that communicates these qualities.
aim for chris hemsworth  and if you get to 50  of what he has then you should be really satisfied. just letting you know that he uses peds  like testosterone  etc  to get his insane physique. he obviously works very hard  just dont be disappointed if you dont get to his level even after many years of work. also genetics play a massive role. there s a study where a person in the resistance exercise group even lost muscle after doing a controlled regimented workout plan that everyone followed while other people built crazy amounts of muscle in the same period of time. again your mileage may vary  I just dont want you to be disappointed. certainly aim to be the healthiest you can be though!
not every woman has an hourglass body type  but that isn t an excuse to be overweight. there are different types of bodies  ectomorphic  etsomorphic  and endomorphic. but each one of these body types has a more  fit and healthier version  of them  people who have endomorphic body types are known for being big boned  but even they have ideal body standerds of minimal fat and defined muscles.there is a healthy level of fat within the body that is required  but for some reason that isn t being promoted at all in media more frequently.
agreed
so trueit makes my eyes roll every time
further proving that  woke  is the true  misogynistic
have you seen  the princess  movie  a perfect example of how ugly and unappealing they make female protagonists in this day and age.
agreed. everyone nowadays are so easily offended. its incredibly pathetic. now pretty is the new ugly. so freaking stupid.
@martin bryant  also many traits that are universally considered attractive also are tied to interdictors of health among other things like not being over or under weight  sexual maturity etc
@mr. sinjin-smyth  she doesnt look that bad
guessing all the surprised people in the comments still haven t heard the news about the currently in development tomb raider game  lara will be a middle aged lesbian that relies on a squad of tomb raiders. so basically tomb raider will now just be woke gears.
@spr1ggan -  they just cant avoid corrupting everything canthey thats clearly a bad fetish fanfic idea
robskalas!lmaooo! hehe!!hahaha!!! hahahaha!!!!
ngl  that made me chuckle
larry  the transgenda  croft
but  hello you !
@martin bryant  yes  Imuch prefer that people prioritize interacting with real women  which I do. I also do illustration  so Im just sharing some observations from having to think through what makes for effective character design from time to time.
@martin bryant  no problem  it happens. thanks.
@martin bryant  yep. but how good  what after interacting with women we can relieve stress and headache in video games
@martin bryant  dude  just because we re discussing a video game woman doesnt mean we dont interact with real women. projecting much  you do know what they say about assumptions  right
thats  jessica yaniv  cosplaying as lara croft.
@psycho drummer  loool
trans
I disagree. that looks far less feminine than even ruby rose does.
very well said
melanie your just an utter legend you always put a smile on my face as I have crippling anxiety so thank you xxx
melonie really defensive of lara haha  I agree with her its just adorable. I like how passionate she is about the character. thats how I am with mk. I agree her face looks manly or something.
she looks absolutely horrible here... oh my God. how  why  this is unacceptable. they re literally destroying her. thank you melonie for talking about this. we wont let this happen. my dear lara  Im so sorry!
do you ever play the fan-made levels  on trcustoms for example  whilst the majority are naff you will find some real gems  sabatu s remake of the original game being a real highlight! its like her true adventures can continue on for years to come.
omg another huge lara stan ! Im so excited! lol I love lara. she s been my hero since I was 13 and first played tr1. Ive been watching them destroy her for years. in my head cannon  underworld was the last game.
also lara is a character whose never been so hyper unrealistic many most women could achieve a similar look if they put a bit of effort  maybe not in everyway but simply being fit cantypically up a person s looks a fair amount like in the movies they had done with a body that was extremely close to the game character in looks
it looks like a dude cosplaying as lara croft took the words right out of my mouth.that thing looks hideous.
honestly this is about as surprising as biden threatening someone.
5 00 those are exactly my words. desecrated. they desecrated her image and who she is.
I was never really a fan of lara croft  I just wasn t that interested   but given that they do this all the time with other video games  like mortal kombat  and movies  I feel your pain. like  Jesus Christ  thatstatue looks more like a skinny man with long hair.
the problem with a lot of statutes is the face sculpt. there are so many statutes out there that have had perfect bodies on them  then I pan up to see the face that looks like the plastic spent too much time in the sun and has melted partially as a result. also ugh those boots....what where they thinking!  there are way better statutes that you can find out there. yes  they are also much more expensive but if you are gonna take the dive on a statue to put in your room to admire from time to time might as well go all in on the investment. az from hawt toys has some real great places to look for statutes of pristine quality.
that model has an aura of  its ma am  surrounding it.
this is from weta s own live stream and they seemed proud of it.  hopefully they ll fix it cause they re getting blasted on twitter.
lara croft   who is she meant to be  whatever the fuck that is meant to be   did you just assume my gender ! reeeee!!!
yep I told this to people when they were mocking people angry at tifa shrunk chest in the final fantasy 7 remake  its a small change now but they will keep going until the character is unrecognizable  first they shrunk lara chest in one game then shrunk her hips in another then made her slightly more butch now they have outright turned here into a man wearing girl cloths nushera style.
@melonie mac  og lara was such an icon it is still recognized worldwide even by non gamers and still loved by fans so many years later. im on holiday in france and noticed a family by the pool with 2 classic lara beach towels  with lara on her side with red glasses etc  im sure you now wich one  I was immidiately hyped thinking you can buy one but no  these towels were sold by eidos as merchandise back in the 90s. and yet you can see families using them 25 years later she s such an icon. you just cant make up a new lara and force people the idea thatshe s the icon now. it just happens organnicaly. oh well just my thoughts. hope we ll see more of classic lara someday
we went from gorgeous lara  to  girl next door  lara and now we have larry croft
lara croft is my favorite video game character! I hate what they ve done to her appearance over the years. Im shocked they haven t made her fat or obese blue hair lez yet.
probably did that to make it cheaper and mass producible but a huge mistake for them due to the quality drop. maybe they thought people would be tricked by the stock images before ordering and getting something different than what they expected.
in an ideal world  they would copy melonie s face for lara...but then melonie would have lara s face tattooed on her arm  but then lara s face would now be melonie s face  meaning melonie would then have to get a tattoo of her own face.

hbo max already took out mk
@c j  mk isn t on there anymore  they had them the other day lol they had everything mk on there. going to check. I have them all on dvd and blu ray but of they did that then thatsucks
@mkf30  the original mk movies are so amazing now compared to the new one. not sure why they had to bring that new dude in.
@c j  I enjoyed the new one more than annihilation but I love the first the best of the 3 as far as the live films are concerned. scorpions revenge was awesome and battle for the realms was fun. Im looking forward to mk 2 will have johnny cage and a new writer on board.
@mkf30  I used to hate annihilation  but over the years I enjoyed the cheesiness and craziness of it. I hope they do johnny cage well.
@c j  yeah mka is a good laugh honestly but man story wise they butchered it lol. noob coming out of ermacs chest I was like wtf  lol but I did love the subzero vs scorpion fight that was the bomb. same some fans want mistle or whatever his name is some wrestler or john cents to be cage lol Im like what  no lol
Im so sorry but lmaoooooooooooo thats hilarious at this point
yes I loooove trle levels
trle s are excellent for most of them.templar s secret is one of my favorites.but what do you think about tomb raider the dagger of xian  the in progress remake made by a french fan named nicobass.
the modding community  had a picnic  with tifa long after the remake came out  twitter was d mpsterfire as a massive number of players downloaded the mods to use them.
the remake is literally kingdom hearts fan shipper bullshit
to be honest  I thought the  girl next door  lara was good too. I liked that version and the original version. but they re going too far now  in my opinion.
@lenio barcelos  they should have kept the  lara  out and create a new franchise.
the girl next door lara is still so pretty but very different from og lara but this figure is just straight up ugly
but melonie could get a tattoo of lara with a tattoo of lara with a tattoo of lara.
6 08 woah thats the very same statue Ive had for over twenty years. always sits over my tv no matter where Imove to or how flat my screen has gotten.
it literally looks like drake bell cosplaying laura croft.
lara has the skills that kill and the looks that killthree cheers from female embodiment!
I want like a tomb raider and indiana jones crossover where they meet up and they think they are enemies but then have to work together to solve an archeological mystery!
mel you would make a good lara croft at a convention you have a similar appearance to our favourite lara look
this is so true. she looks like a dude. I cant keep looking at it  its creeping me out. lara should be that untenable woman that women want to be and men want to be with. Imiss classic lara croft. and thatsecond set of pictures of comparison  the pic s on the right dont look like lara croft. and yes angelina jolie did such a good job as lara. I need to rewatch those movies.
so many franchises are being destroyed lately. for that reason  I have been buying retro games more often lately  at both thrift stores and online stores like amazon and ebay. I am realizing that we were previously in the the golden ages of gaming now thatso many game companies have gone crazy. I recently payed over one hundred dollars on ebay for silent hill 3  because it is the only game in the series that I haven t played yet. I think the latest tomb raider games are alright  but the last one that I thought was really good is tomb raider anniversary  from 2007 .
thats just embarrassing lol  you can make a lara croft statue that looks like lara croft even for  40 lol.
this is a longer comment  but I cannot help it when I feel urged to speak from the heart. I just feel like the world I have grown up with has just fallen into intellectual anarchy  because I would love to hear how it is not  especially when twitter has a huge presence whether people wants to see the connection or not. let s not forget that people have freaking  done horrible things to themselves and died because of their harassment. if I could have  even with my own inner demons I have carried for years  I ignore my own pain  my animosities towards some aspects of the world and whatever else so that others dont have to. my own father that is a disabled army vet from a botched surgery thatshouldn t have happened and feel nothing but resentment towards the people who have approved it I am aware that youre a strong Christian melonie  but please do understand that regardless of how you and anyone else feels about what my perspectives are  imagine watching your own father turn from a happy jokey man  into a semI bitter stoic man  just trying to handle the pain where my own mother was worried about him for months. one day I wrote to the president  in hopes that he would put the va s feet to the fire and it did pay off. I am still in a position where I absolutely distrust them not to drag their feet  considering certain people in charge.if anyone ever asks me on why I would wish to be famous and wealthy  I would use that money  to help my family  my girlfriend and her family  mediatech institute in katy  roughly the houston location  which if I have to take it in my own hands to greatly improve that location myself  I will if the dallas  the main mediatech hq  location wont. Imight be only five days older than you  but if I feel compelled to do good for others if the people and or organizations fail to do so themselves. beyond that  I can only wish to inspire strength in people  especially when most try so hard to sell their snake oils to people hoping for a better life.
with 3d printing becoming more commonplace now fans should be able to use the some of the good 3d models of lara available online in order to print 3d figures of her that are accurate  detailed and quite cheap .. the warhammer 40k community has become quite accustomed to printing their own 3d models of the the warhammer 40k figures because games workshop  the company that owns the franchise  really overprices the figures used in the tabletop game  which players need to have dozens and dozens of for big battles .so maybe if somebody from the wh40k community is here they can give us some useful input on what it takes to turn some of the good 3d models of lara available online into printed 3d figures.
can we just talk about how big the white puffs are on her boots
this whole generic movement is exactly why I love eastern games and shows. Im so tired of western media showcasing masculine women as  powerful woman  when a true powerful woman would be both powerful and feminine. its like they genuinely think you cannot be both at the same time
dude this makes me think of the how Imet your mother episode where the group goes to the gym and ted  lily  and barney joke about how robin looks sweaty without makeup with barney even saying  oh hey dude .
I think there was a medieval device invented that could hurl items  such as cursed objects like that. however  if catapults were invented today  would they be called yeet-o-matics
I d pay for a life size melonie mac statue. and I d pay extra for a melonie mac dressed as lara croft one!
this is leah thomas s year. all the swimming medals  named woman of the year  and now made into a lara croft figure
its so funny  it literally looks like drake bell  speaking of mobile game  I think not using the original lara render as the mascot is a really big missed opportunity! I hate chibI lara
this is why I stick with the old lara croft content merchandise.
I am not a toy collector  but that original action figure would stay in the box.
Im not sure that its not an accident. these series of figure is intended to be a caricature of the character with exaggerated traits  I wonder what physical trait could be exaggerated with lara croft     . I think that it was intended to be a caricature of reboot lara and it ended up ugly.
wished they modeled her after melanie  those big eyes are so dope and pretty Imean she s really pretty period ...Im not simping only saying she has killua eyes cat eyes.... iunno honestly dont know how this channel isn t more popular when all she does is see the truth
because the remakes sucked
capcom did the same thing with jill valentine from the og re3. they remade her to look more masculine  thicker  and edited her outfit. now  it was always 100  clear that jill was wearing a mini-skirt... you have people fighting that it was always short-shorts despite all of the photos  etc. I ll stick with my og characters from the golden years of gaming.
its ok you didn t do a verses of the day. there s always next time. besides  this one would have gotten me all bumfuzzled too.
the disrespect for one of the most iconic video game characters of all time. Ive seen better looking custom statues than this garbage.
still better than her first toy biz figure
its not ugly  its just character accurate since she s british. lol
she looks like she d be from some hallmark movie where you d take the grumpy british maid and give her a huge makeover  but at the beginning where no one really wants to look at her.
holy crap  that guybrush threepwood statue looks great...
when they said lara croft I think they thought marty krofft.
poor melonie..she loves lara so much and they just keep doing her dirty haha
Imiss the 90s. remember the top cow tomb raider comics  and crossovers with witchblade  it was a good time to be 16.
I remember rhona mitra who was the live action model of lara croft before angelia jolie. she has the eyes as well.
lara is only really intimidating if youre looking at her on the game cover or something. if youre experiencing her as intended  i.e  playing one of her games  youre not intimidated by her because  functionally  you are her. she s an almighty badass  but you make her so - its you who makes her jump and flip and climb and blow the holy hell out of dinosaurs. thats not intimidating  its exhilarating - and outside of that  well  yeah  she s a sexy  dangerous  impossibly cool woman. this is a bad thing  I dont get some people.
oh my gosh...that is hideous. I wouldn t take that even if it were free! they want people to fork over money for that! the collector in me says  save my cash for something else.
oh God...so glad I have the older stuff...they at least tried   w now bishoujo lara statue from kotobukiya  gimmie  gimmie  money in a bank!  0w0
its from a lost quantum leap spin-off where he jumps into the body of someone from an alternative universe  this being the tomb raider universe.
so is this the lara croft thats still a rookie or is this an older lara croft with some city miles on her    - fans yes.   - weta
Ive always wanted a ben shapiro action figure.
today s lara lara croft  its ma am! its ma am!!
well  this is peak square enix tomb raider  lara croft with the face of squall leonhart. and the statue doesnt even have chibI proportions. its just... mok-kos  but lara croft.
Im glad you liked the comparison pic lol. Im just so tired of people bend over backwards to make excuses for the people in charge of tomb raider. lara croft looks unrecognisable  oh its cause of realism. lara croft figure is ugly  oh its stylised how dare you complain  you wanted merch  here it is  eat up anything they give you as long as it has  tomb raider  or  lara croft  on it. I hate the whole toxic positivity within the fanbase which is essentially fans of the survivor rebranding saying  get over it . no  no og fans are looking for this. the current fans would feel the same if the franchise started with survivor lara then switched to og lara probably  because these characters are two different people  not to mention how the games are different. essentially the survivor era fans want more of the same  so they want the og fans to get over it  meanwhile if the new version of lara gets criticised its suddenly  nolaraleftbehind   whilst og fans are left with  notraceoflaraleftbehind . the differences between og lara and current lara are so clear as day to anyone  but the survivor trilogy fans will make any excuse as to why this is acceptable  and that to point it out is just being a troll or being negative essentially  wtf. for people so focused on positivity they dont seem to care much about someone s fave video game character being left bodysnatched and with a lobotomy  what s positive about that happening. anyway  big long rant sorry  all this to say thank you for calling out the bs  the hypocrisy  the excuses and all the annoying crap with the total rebranding of tomb raider  I will always appreciate it  because not enough people do call it out
solid burn lol...
outstanding
I thought it looks like patrick warburton or brendan fraser
honestly  an actual ben shapiro action figure would be hilarious and amazing.and it would totally not care about anyone s feelings.
girl nextdoor me - bro  can I borrow your saw laura - its ma am!
it looks like the guy from ctrl alt delete crossplaging as lara.  is this loss   funny thing was one of the first crossplays I remember was when you cosplayed as psycho mantis!
I wouldn t call it ugly... I think it looks very handsome!
I just found your channel  and I am so so impressed!! a beautiful and intelligent woman and your a Christian!! wow!! plus a tomb raider fan!! I dont know what else to say! other then  God bless you!! and keep sharing the Lords word!  p.s. I have a pretty large tomb raider collector of my own and I think it looks ugly as well!!
it looks as if there was a surplus of ken doll heads that the barbie franchise couldn t sell so they bought those and popped long hair on em.
I think you hit the nail on the head. that is a statue of a dude cosplaying as lara croft.
thats about on par with the  monkey face leia  from the old power of the force star wars fig like from the 90s.edit  and who is calling this chibI  they clearly do not know what chibImeans...
melonie I think you could play laura croft part very well.
here is what should ve happened square enix should ve sold crystal dynamics but they should ve bought tomb raider off of them and handed lara croft over to one of their japanese divisions cuz if you take a look at all of the sqex related crossovers she s in then you can see that they use her classic look over her survivor look cuz they know that that version of lara croft is much more loved and they could ve made a tomb raider game that was a puzzle rpg that had the feel of the classic games and they probably would ve wanted a more stylized classic version of lara croft for this figure than whatever cd approved.
new game laura sort of looks like the character  anja  creede from the dime store novels known as rogue angel
the girl next door  more like the girl at the end of the street we dont talk about. whyyyy did they make her look like that. its a cursed image at this point.
I hate how female characters are designed these days as if they re worried about protecting the insecurity of some imagined woman in the real world who will feel bad because she cant live up to an idealized beauty. plus  there s an element of sticking it to men who find an attractive woman attractive  as if thats something inherently evil.
there is no way I am paying  40 for dude raider.
I hope its met with the resounding sound of empty tills no comforting kaching! for you.this something that is spreading through everything especially super hero properties. I want to see impossibly fit people in these projects. thats not just the women  I want jason momoa s aqua man shirtless walking in slow motion through the waves! I despair.I still have those playmates figures   the angelina jolie dolls. whatever you thought of the movies you cant argue with jolie s appearance.
not everyone is a drop dead gorgeous as you are. with such a meticulously perfect boom-boom. where s the elvis review
it looks like patrick bateman cosplaying as lara croft
thats some great value shit right there
you know  for a moment  I thought that was a statue of. . . .a man dressed up as lara croft. . . .Imean  dat face doe. . . .!edit  oh wait  you already said that - thatstatue looks like . . yeah  I ll leave it at that. . .
I get mcfarlane 24 dollar 1 8 scale aka 6 to 7 inch digs of dc and walking dead 5 inch figures. the 22.99 dc mcfarlane multiverse figures are amazing and the smaller walking dead figures from 6 plus years ago are screen actor accuracy.  as well as the black series star wars figures.  a 40 dollar figure isn t a cheaby there the 1 step up from the 25 points of articulation deluxe figures the cheaply figures are not made in molds and put on the same displays as good looking figures like they tried itseems with larry croft here
normies needs to feel reflected by the characters they watch. they want to project themselves into her and this is what you get.
lara
lara croft wearing a Christian bale latex mask
it looks like one of those old action figures made for kids with a sheer rubber head meant for chewing. also  what s with the santa boots
it looks like they hired nick cage to play lara croft. then he refused  so they hired a lookalike.
you know how creepy guys like to sneak nasty stuff into casual conversation on the internet. and then laugh it off as if they re above it.that is what they re doing  its all about being nasty in front of innocent wholesome people. this transgender barbie doll is just another example of it.
if you want statues of good looking women then get a prime1studios statue  look at their red sonja  new vampirella or the statues Im getting their 2 gantz statues.
she looks like a damn action man villain lol
crystal dynamics exec 1   you know what I liked to play for a long time  cde2   tomb raider  cde1   no  no  skyrim. cde2   ah! we should make a game like that maybe  cde1   no  thatsounds hard. Imean think about it  first we d have to come up with that character-creation engine  and youremember how well that worked... cde2   ...every character I tried to make  literally looked like ass. cde1   right  even the elves looked like ugly aliens. and bethesda was really trying hard to get that engine right  but the results were just painful. cde2   hm  I wonder if we could make lara croft in the skyrim character creation engine  cde1   oh God  that would be...!  chokes laughing  that would be hideous! ..... six months later!! ...  weta artist receives plans
when the youtuber is more lara croft than the actual figurine
they really just modeled tom cruises face onto laura croft........ lmfao   im dying lol
this is what happens when the alphabet community gets involved in anything...  sad but not entirely unexpected.
that is not a girl next door  its a drag queen cosplay.  there is no thirst for beauty and truth in these creators anymore.  but here s a observation   companies are now judging  or scamming  how well their product s  are being perceived by social media engagement.  they will show how many times a hashtag is used and claim that is success.  prime example of this pro wrestling  where ratings are at an all time low yet social media engagement is high.  so the question is   does using tools of the algorithm  even to critique content  feed the beast
God damn I wasn t ready for that outfit you got in
thats not lara croft. I dont care what name they plaster on the package. lara has an instantly recognizable face and figure  and this isn t even close.the best  worst   part is that they will blame poor sales on lack of fan interest instead of the fact that they tried to substitute a deliberately ugly imposter for the most iconic female character in video game history.
looks more like a henry than a lara... might be the lack of butter

ah old laura  how Imiss you...
I would love a melonie mac lara croft movie
I really liked the 2013 lara.
at this point  I dont even want a new game or a remake. they should just add the original ps1 games to the new playstation classics catalog to I can play them on my ps5. I already own them physically and digital via psn. just let me play them with out booting up my old ps3. haha. fingers crossed and praying.
this new lara looks like the chad meme with a wig. it reminds me of an action figure I had from morph that you could disattach and reattach some x-men s heads on it.yeah  sadly this looks like subversion alright... a  rebel without a cause  type of subversion. fans should not buy any new crap from chad croft.
yeah thats just a straightup dude
she isn t ugly  she is simply male
not surprised. thats why I dont have much faith in the next tr game. just look at what happened with saint s row.
check out anna thatstar was girl s cosplay  calendar ... that is a beautiful legit lara croft. that is all. I am sure you have seen already  mel
why as a straight male would I want to play as or obtain a figure of a fantasy girl as ugly  I like pretty girls  not ugly ones. which is why Im subbed to this channel lol
I was hoping it was just the influence of square forcing lara to wear outfits made of wool rugs in shadow of the tomb raider.looks like thats not the case. if this  un-glamourizing  of lara croft comes directly from crystal dynamics then the franchise is just dead.
oh yeah  I agree with you this time. lara looks like the female version of ash from the evil dead.
how dare you put down lara croft for her looks. I believe she s stunning and brave for the fact how forgettable she is. I hope they next time add her to have blue hair and have many scenes where she translate ancient aztec writings  where she describes the sacrificed victims were offended their pronouns were not used right before they were cannavalized.  my God they will just make dirty money off such fine entertainment.
I kinda think it looks like nathan drake cosplaying lara.  bloody hell...
they ve destroyed so many classic characters and franchises already. I said it when the reboot came out  no one wanted to believe me back then. this ain t lara  chief. its actually so not lara its the opposite of lara.
bro this is so fkn weird. they are doing this across the board with literally all new games! all the women in new games are made to look more androgynous  masculine or ugly. look at women in tlou 1 and then to the women in tlou2. look at the remake of tlou1. look at that korean chick from bf2042. irl she is incredibly pretty. in the game they gave her cheekbones so high and big it makes her look like a mutant hamster with too many chromosomes. and many games that have female protagonists intentionally make them look like older soccer moms  grammas  or stereotypical lesbians  this is due to the influence of people like sarkeesian. who screamed that attractive women in any game where purely eye candy for men so it was never ok for women to ve attractive in games. druckman loves anita and followed her advice to a t  which is why tlou 2 ended up the way it did. why abby has gorilla arms. why every woman in the game looks androgynous or masculine.
0 58 lmaooo melonie you rule !!ugh why cant a lara be sexy again   look at tr 5 s opera dress  she was pure badass and sexy
the huge majority of lara croft fans are going to reject this. the only ones that are going to buy it are the woke ones and there aren t enough of them to make a profit.
the face is lara s cousin  lars.and the boots and looks like they were for a space marine look at how thick the socks are.
the facrt its cheap isnb t an excuse for it to look like crap. the good smile company pop up parade was designed to be affordable  at 20 quid and theylook amazing. this has agenda winall verit
dont worry folks  the next tr game may as well feature transgender lesbian asian lara  now identifying herself  sorry  himself  sorry  itself as alex   suffering from getting overweight  hair loss and lower-limbs paralysis  but her adoptive trio of lgbtq..  ..abcd whatever  but mostly gay parents  of african  jewish   muslim heritage  living in an eskymo ice-hut  will support her  via tiktok videos  in her quest to find the courage to get into a wheelchair and use it to pursue the goal of finding happiness and inner balance - also thanks to her  medically-assisted   intercourse-avoided  pregnancy  presented as a shocking twist to the story . after this 2 hour introductory cinematographic piece finishes  you ll play as either lara  sorry  alex  or one of her  sorry  his  sorry its  npc or live - in a multiplayer mode  friends  with the gameplay  up to 6 hours  if you decide to uncover all secrets  focused on tasks providing emotional support for volunteered mastectomy for lara  sorry  alex. naturally  that will require some discussions   feedback  so do expect the thrill of being able to chat with your co-players all the time  in written and or verbal form - depending on the game mode selected. the last chapter is going to be visiting a hospital to lara s  sorry  alex s  gynecologist to get the baby delivered  as well as to get the papers  so that these - after brief  30 min cinematics celebrating new life -  can be delivered to lara s  sorry  alex s new urologist. ending cinematics are going to show lara s  sorry  alex s claustrophobia  which our beloved protagonist will use to tell her friends  and breaking the 4th wall  to us  the gaming community   thatshe  sorry  he  sorry  it would never-ever raid anything  because - and this d be the very last entry  a deep thought of hers  sorry  his  sorry  it -  I got a baby and nobody had to raid my womb  so why would I raid a tomb to get something out of there  it would just feel so wrong and unjust!  - while lifting her  sorry  his  sorry its smiling baby into the sunshine of her  sorry  his  sorry  its modestly sized and sparsely furnished apartment.once you beat the game  you ll have the option to switch lara s condition  the choices could be lower limbs paralysis  upper limbs paralysis  incontinence  permanent diarrhea  unspecified brain damage  a few social phobias  schizophrenia or sympathies for communism  and outfit  inherited  donated or second-hand shop stock-removed goods . all that to increase the variety of the cinematics  sorry  in the gameplay  as well as to prepare the gamer for the ultimate challenge any really innovative  tr game could possibly offer - time trial. yeah!be honest - could any of youresist playing such a wonderfully politically correct woke gem of a conscious  educating  real life-reflecting and responsibility-teaching game --sadly  being completely serious   honest but brief - I think new lara sucks completely  and that both in her character portrayal  as well as in her looks - she has been castrated as a badass and de-feminized as a woman  that new lara-pretender looks like a brother I never had . the results are devastating and should be evident to anyone knowing the classical games.--lbnl roughly @9 25 lara on the left looks as if she was modelled after an angry lara flynn boyle in her mid-twenties  while the one on the right looks as if brian austin green  at around similar age  underwent gender-alteration surgery and tried to emulate miss boyle s face.
at least we know what tom cruise would look like if he ever got the role...
thatstatue is going to financially backfire on whoever it was who thought it was a good idea to make her look that way. somebody over there is probably lose their job  both the sculptor and whoever the hell gave final approval for mass production.thatseriously looks like a male cosplaying as lara  that doesnt even look to me like an unattractive female face.
dont you think you ve seen enough   yes I have and Im sick of this shit.
youre another hater not when you come to laura kraft youre somebody that I actually care and love the character
underworld is peak lara for me  the first tomb raider 2013 was the worst and I think the next gen remaster of that and the subsequent 2 sequels are better than that at least.
oh my gosh  they made lara a short train
last week I got a rare tomb raider model in box for around  60   the one w lara croft holding twin uzI s akimbo against the area51 backdrop  at comic con that was 1000 times worth the price than this flat chested  ugly abomination that has shame to call itself tomb raider.
what s up mel!! lol let s go here comes the laura croft rant
main reason why Im making my own games nows is because of this woke sjwism feminist activism in the video game industry and american culture.should really be thankful to these idiots for pushing me towards doing things I never would have seen myself doing. things like programing and design.
this is ridiculous  an absolute eyesore. Im so burnt out with all this woke crap. I want lara back!
apparently mgm just lost the film rights and alicia has exited the role
its aloy all over again. she was beautiful in the first game  and is ugly in forbidden west.
you haven t seen the the labyrinth david bowie. they are their own design. ludo is fantastic sarah not so much.
even guys look better cosplaying as lara! I would spend my 40 bucks on a prettier lara.
the minI epics line is a stylization of the characters in it. they re always going to look anime like. its what makes the line fun and great. some of y all are looking for hate in things when there isn t.
I cant look at her face without thinking of drake bell  I cant unsee it.
the only things about the  old  lara I truly miss are the braid and dual pistols. Im really glad she finally looks like a real human. the lau era was the worst... especially underworld. the gianormous hands and feet  ridiculously thin arms and neck. cartoonish monstrosity...
I think she is still very beautifull    even more real.  3
wow  we re upset over a face now  bond has had quite a handful of different  faces  over half a century and he seems to have done alright.
she looks like anne hathaway in princesses diary but before the make over.
does anyone else think it looks like handsome squidward cosplaying as laura croft.
that cant be lara croft... this is larry croft lmao...
thatstatue looks like robbie rotten from lazy town with lara s costume on
they made luke crotch not lara croft
the face make it look more like larry croft than laura.
apparently you didn t watch the video as this was addressed multiple times lol
@melonie mac go boom  I actually did. Im telling you your outrage on this is incorrect. all minI epics are done in this style and most collectors I know love it. maybe youre new to this line or maybe you just need clicks for some fake outrage I dont know.
@josh long  no  she is correct. its not the minI epic styling  its the shape of the characters head face and features. googled minI epics for the first time  found minI epic sarah  she does not have man face. lara croft does not have man face in the games or angelina jolie. this new tr one could pull of minI epic aragon before it could pull off minI epic arwen.
@d  Im gonna trust my experience and knowledge with these products if you dont mind. if you need to feel this way to be outraged at whatever then you do you.
@josh long  you dont need experience or knowledge on a figure to visually describe it. Im going to trust my eyes if you dont mind. not that I care if you do. not sure why youre outraged at people s observations. do you though.
I think old lara is best. by far.
yeah but none of them where delibratly ugly.even the new bond movie didnt do that even with a geuine old man as bond.
@wilma gregg  what is  ugly  to you
when a human actor takes over a role  you cannot help them having a different face  just try and find an actor who resembles bond.with a plastic figurine  you can make them look how you want. theres no excuse for her having a mans face in this figurine  at all.
@tizerist  I had more problem s with princess peach s face in recent games.
@backup368  thatstatue is ugly. dont play that  beauty is subjective  garbage. the vast majority of people would come to a consensus on what features are and aren t ugly in a person. making lara croftlook manly and dull makes her ugly  even more so because she s supposed to be attractive.
@pete saguy  then dont buy it. wow  dont buy it what a novel concept.
@backup368   dont like it  dont buy it  is literally the laziest marketing argument in history. and its only used by lazy  woke marketers. a similar argument could have easily  ie  lazily   been made when the first sonic the hedgehog trailer dropped. but the director liked sonic  liked the fans  and  most importantly from a marketing standpoint  liked money. their job is to persuade us to buy  not just demand our acceptance and buy anyway.
@backup368  a face or body having features that delibratly stand out as not fitting the rest of the body at glance.in this case the boyish jaw and face on a womans body.a incrediply feminine face on a incrediply masculine body would be just as ugly.or a andorngenous person with the lower body of a masculine body builder etc etc.
@before movies sucked!  that movie had a budget of  90 million. I laughed at the notion of sonic s appearance in the movie  too. how can it bother that many adults  this action figure probably has a budget of less than  1000   they ll only make as many as there would be a demand.
@wilma gregg  I guess the funko pop lara crofts are also the same way  they all have the same face as the other funkos.
obvious troll is obvious.
@backup368  no they dont funko pops arnt made to be realistic proportions they are made to be bobblehead like aka tiny body big head.this is not tiny body big head or cartoonish proportions this is normal human body with horrible unfitting porportions.
@wilma gregg  so that means that you cant give her bigger lips or a curvier body or a head that doesnt look like a mashed potato  because they made exceptions before. this is normal human body with horrible unfitting porportions. nobody even mentioned that the figure could just be a mockup. figures go through multiple phases in the creation process   I dont see a link where you can pre-order the figure yet.
@backup368  fair enough about the princess peach thing but its not comparable  peach is a cartoon while croft is based on an actual woman
@tizerist  exactty like a course a cartoon would look horrfying if you brought it into realism.Imean thats literally a major meme people like meat canyon do all the time.
@backup368  the weirdest part about this  there are thousands of women in reality that cosplay and look like the original curvy  full lipped lara croft. what is the studios issue with reality and the original character  why are any changes  besides graphic quality updates being made to the characters appearance  why are they so phobic of the original lara design
@tizerist  what  lara croft was not meant to be cartoony
@d  its probably going to end up being a huge overreaction. did you have a problem with the fortnite skins or the brawlhalla character
@backup368  I dont have issues with characters from games lol  I question why others do. someone looked at the original character  hated itso much they invested time   money in changing it. Im only curious as to why.
@backup368  in 1994 s gaming scene  a typical video game  protagonist was sonic or ryu. compared to those  she was not cartoony. same with the first virtua fighter characters. back then  ps1 models  were as realistic as they got.
@d  yeah  somebody at the workshop just went  I want to piss my potential customers off .
@tizerist  if I compared her to characters in siphon filter  fade to black  star wars  sote or turok  she looks more caartoony as do other characters in tomb raider.
thats woody from toy story. lol
who wants a figure of someone cosplaying lara croft
thatstatue looks like robbie rotten from lazy town with a lara s costume on
yup  its totally not lara anymore at all. both looks and characteristic gone! in re2 claire may have been changed by looks but the character is still the same  the current lara croft is totally not lara at all  just a woke character with lara in name only.
thats not lara croft...thats drake bell in tomb raider cosplay...
bringoldlaracroftback
the statue s face reminds me of the older brother on icarly.
holy crap man. that looks like peter gallagher and adam scott had a child.
lara croft   I think they made lance croft.
weta using the mr frodo mold for lara s face....
thats  lars croft . not lara croft.
larry croft with kung-fu action grip
Im fairly certain that the face model is charles bronson from death wish. lmao.
thats not lara croft  thats a man baby! - austin powers
oh my God! thats why she looked familiar! thats harland williams!
ok  now that I watched the video   I feel about galadriel in lotr what you do about lara.  they gave her armor and cheap elf ears in rings of power. she is not the ethereal  thousands years old being I  .    notmygaladriel
hilarious...    sadge...  dude is right. lara is packing and it ain t her pistols.  notourlara  bringbackcroft
the statue looks like martin short in transition
you have to download the picture of laura  open it and then you can zoom in. just in case you want to do it in the future.
a tom cruise face with giant man feet. maybe they re going for a greek mythology version.
this cant be official...
thatstatue looks like a female version of drake bell
I get it.  it is a doll you want to rip the head off of.
in shadow they made her look like a middle school social studies teacher
holly what kind of abomination  did they make out of our beloved lara
looks more like  larry croft ! maybe its some kind of future spin-off
I wouldn t even take it for free
hImelonie I know Im late as always I agree with u about company s messing up games like hers yet again.takecare melonie
I think her face in shadow of the tomb raider is kinda ugly! I think she was absolutely gorgeous in the 2013 teaser trailer. and she just went down hill slower and slower each game.
real women are ugly ! twitter user 2022
I wouldn t pay  10 for that mess
I was referring to the original lara!
thatstatue s face is giving sheldon cooper in a wig.
Ive seen that face on a deck of old maid playing cards.
2 12 she actually looks just like the lara
the  tomb raider reloaded  lara looks really familiar. I wonder who.....
look at what they did to my girl -- melonie mac every other stream.this is the same reason people dont buy comic books anymore.
omg thats so sad  40  bucks  maybe  3.99  mel the look on your face is priceless. great job as always.
my eyes!  please tell me embracer didn t approve this atrocity.  that thing s more terrifying than baby eminem sauron.  or abby.  why do western companies so hate the feminine form   melonie  as a huge tomb raider fan and collector  would you have this in your collection
crystal dynamics just needs to bring melonie in on all things lara at this point. let her make the decisions since she cares more about it than they do. thatsaid  eat moar butter and go to the gym!!!
remember when lara croft was fearless
where to begin. itseems like they change lara s model for every game. I agree that the picture you showed looks like male face. the pony tail is wrong too. but those boots! they are way too big.
holy crap!! I just now realized  this lara has the face and head  of one of those male puppets from that old thunderbirds marionette show! i
like the iconic character ms. swan  madtv  said  ooo  she lookah like-kah man
the names lara... lara bond.
it looks like larry croft  mid transition.
she looks like action man with a wig
that lara croft statue looks like Christian bale with long hair.
lara croft  testosterone raider
the comparisons I can see how new nu lara just isn t the same as classic lara up to legend. but if the new one is the  girl next door  to you  I d like to know your address meanwhile  the statue is the girl next door  the girl next door to me. you see why I d want to know your address

the face looks like young jerry o connell   for the gen z watching this  he is a male actor
dont assume leo croft s gender  please.
gg! lara looks like drake bell. drakebell
I guess they ve cast charlie sheen to play lara croft now
well looks like you ll have another lara croft topic with the movie rights lapsing and studios are now going after it  https   youtu.be lnnwwjrx6pw
looks like she says  bruh  in a deep voice.
my naive ass is hoping they pull a sonic and release something horrendous before the real thing hits.
she kinda looks like corey feldman
why are they so afraid to embrace lara s femininity !
she looks like bob odenkirk in a wig.

lara croft is suppose to be super hot... like its not hard  how canthey fuck that up
I think its missing a soul patch.
definately deliberately done. really obvious at this point.
w t  workshop is not cheap or budget its expensive really really really expensive. not sure where you live but this statue is 700  where I live no matter the site
it looks like they took a leftover male doll and put her clothes on it.
they need to fix it
hey  ugly statues need loving too.
its larry croft.
also  what is up with those enormous boots!   they make her look even goofier.
it doesnt just look like a dude  it looks like a derpy dude.
thats lara s sister  karen
looks like they stuck jerry o connell s face on her. dafuq
unbelievable.
why lara croft lookin like drake bell
looks like they have recycled the face and boots of an action men figure
I have two questions. what the hell is  chibI  and what the hell is with those boots
the new lara croft henceforth shall be known as lara daft.
she almost looks like a female tom cruise.
she has sesame street bert s eyebrows.
they cant help but destroy everything
this statue is 100 . they usually make expensive statues  but these specific ones were made with the intent of being affordable.
thats larry croft
they gave lara croft a manly ass face...melonie  you look great as always though!
laurasoft ...they even call her laura  lore ah  in the new  trs ...clearly lara has been replaced. Im not confident we ll ever get her back. Im just waiting for tony sparkles  he s poor  he s gay.....he s... cardboard man.
why is ross from the tv-series friends lara playing croft
thankfully your pc didn t want to zoom in on the... whatever that thing was. unfortinately I can see the face on my phone perfectly fine.
she looks like ross from friends....
looks like a melted wax work of bruce campbell
her face looks like mark wahlberg from ted.
lets make lara girl next door.more like crossdresser next door.
well  the symbols that they have appropriated need to represent them  and their values. so of course  it needs to be ugly.
I guess they dont want to make any money
looks like one of the cast from the show sliders either jerry o connell or the guy who plays the brother   .   what no verse of the day or reading of previous   lol thats still cool  and God bless everyone.
Im a dude  he s a dude  she s a dude  cause we re all dudes.
cant stop laugthing
oh boy oh boy... thats supposed to be lara croft  yikes!
the title
its larry croft
example  72951 in the ongoing series  why we cant have nice things.
you sound sad  itsucks when they destroy the things you love.
she looks like a  robert.
the statue s face looks like it belongs on a male figure...which at this point was likely done on purpose.
this is a nathen croft  or lara drake damn it leave lara alone.
looks like larry croft
why does she look like ross from friends
thats lard croft....
face looks like a young bruce campbell .circa evil dead   evil dead 2
they made lara croft as a man.
thats brendan fraser from the mummy.
lc is supposed to be a 10 10 beautiful women. deal yo!
thatstatue definitely has a man s face  but maybe that is really meant to be a man s head from another one of their products  except they stuck this wrong head onto lara croft s body.
the boots of that figure look two or three sizes too large  like she s about trip over herself when she runs.
I was just about to say they made lara a trans woman then you said she looks like a dude lol
Imiss those days when female characters were sexy...Im flat myself but I dont care that women in games are beautiful than myself. and what we get now  Im glad that we have still handsome male characters in games...for now
next version lark croft  postop version
her face looks like janeway from stv
Im getting austin powers mike meyers vibes. lol yeah baby
yo do you actually eat butter by the stick  or is that a meme
thats not lara thats a guy in a wig
she looks like someone  who was called larry six months ago and stalks lesbians on dating apps.
getting cardI b oh my God what is that vibes with thatstatue
ps why do her boots look like she s stood in wet cement which dried around her

my inner child is screaming  thats not lara! thats laura!!! I hate laura!!!!!   notmylara!

the face looks kind of like richard harmon lol
lmfaoooo!!  isn t that will ferrell s face from night at the roxbury    xddd look it up
I just cant even look at that... repaint!  bust out the bondo and resculpt  because paint isn t going to fix that. I vote melonie mac for the next tomb raider.
she identified and she her or he him
is that abby from tlou
fuggles need games too
laura is now a handsome woman and look at those feet! ack ack
looks like brendan fraser..  tomb fraser
well melonie is it the male gaze or to make women happy
lara croft if he she were trans. thats a man cosplaying as the tomb raider.
looks like Christian bale
cartoony laura has your eyes
not people defending them making lara nonbinary because the statue is cheap. lemme remind you that there were hundreds of cheap statues of lara in the late 90s and early 2000s and she was never flat chested and or with a masculine face.
well lara croft is a he  so yeah
good smile company makes statues called pop up parades for  40 and their woman look great  I have a few of them. go check the one of elizabeth from seven deadly sins. so saying that this is just affordable is total garbage.
what tribe is your heritage from melonie
yeah...calling it cheap doesnt mean the sculpt has to be lame.
larry croft
I cant put my finger on it.. but that looks like a male actor.
unless the person  repainting  this...thing is Jesus Christ  I doubt they have the skill to fix this.
she looks like barbie boyfriend
I think what could be going on here and please do forgive me if I am wrong about this. but maybe crystal dynamics are trying to pander to the unfortunate ones that are actually ugly through no real fault of their own  to some people  but not all  spiders or other insects are ugly  but they are simply the way that they are. but maybe for some people who are unfortunately ugly  may simply hate seeing beautiful people always being portrayed. or it could be because of how some  but certainly not all. how some pretty people react to seeing ugly people  which is an issue of itself. or it could be both factors at work  either way  you are right melonie  companies movies and now even games are trying to push their own or certain agendas into things that have already been made preestablished  just so that they can appeal as you say to the people who are woke. Im surprised that they haven t tried to make lara croft a coloured person yet and I want to make it perfectly clear that I have no problem at all with coloured people. but I do feel that a lot of people would simply not accept a black lara croft  but not because she s black  but simply because  lara croft is white and that is not to offend anyone. lara croft was made white  it is as plain and as simple as that. Im all for coloured characters  but we really should not have diversity just for the sake of diversity  that would be like someone trying to make lara croft trans  stating thatshe once used to be a man  just to appeal to trans people  which I also have nothing against those kind of people. but a trans characteer needs to be so  by their origins and not by gender swapped or coloured swapped. if any character is going to be gay  bI  trans or coloured  they should be so  by their origins and not as a means to replace someone that was already made a certain way.
I have a really nice little rock candy lara croft figure that looks 100  better than this and its cheaper lol
there is nothing chibI about thatthats 100  a dude in a padded bra
looks like she went from angelina jolie to sandra bullock.
trans raider  it is mam! edition
the body design ain t even chibi
does this come with a strap-on
is  lara  going to start to use the name  larry   looks like a bloke!!
I am just surprised it doesnt have a bulge in the groin area.
what s with the clodhoppers
when did they make her ugly before
laura croft  looks more like larry croft..
bruh this looks like a dude from the 60s with big sideburns. what were they thinking
yeah they also make good car models too  like they make a model of the gunsmith cats shelby  one of the few really that captures the look of the car properly  and its 1 43 scale and not a trillion dollars neither.
ironically  sandra bullock was the leading contender to play lara before angelina jolie. of course  that was 1998 sandra...
@before movies sucked!  she is way too thin now and the pretty face she had is long gone.look at the proposal to see what Imean
trans lara croft
bruh looks like drake from drake and josh
I dont know why youre complaining. larry croft looks great. lol
one look at the face of the weta lara statuette.in the immortal words of magog of morskar   that...is a maaaaaaan. what s happened to weta recently  the rop design work is lazy and cheap  their lara statuette needs to come with a 1 6th-scale paper bag...
me who actually played tomb raider   you do realize lara croft is a sexy  smart  strong  independent woman right  feminist   reeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!
yes this is bad ive seen some good face morphs on daz 3d of lara and some less that good ones too but way back it was much better when tomb raider was in british hands oh core design....
why does lara croft look like peter pan on a budget  the disrespect.
that thing looks like a dollar store  made-in-china knockoff called lauren kraft.
she looks like michael dukakis
tom cruise
things aren t beautiful because they re beautiful. things are beautiful because society. so we have to make things ugly so ugly is beautiful. and if something is beautiful itshould be smashed
so this is the lesbian soccer player version of lara croft
there is only one word for this prop  crap  and to say  40 is okay is bs its worth is zero.
Ive seen lego custom tomb raider minifigures that look better than that .and lego is a hard medium to translate to .
looks like drake bell
wait... nathan drake is trans now
even the neck is too thick. its a dudes neck.
boom
Ive seen hasbro make better looking star wars sequel trilogy toys
I thought she was wearing a fedora trying to look like an old man  but thats her hair lol why do they need to uglify everything!  fictional female characters aren t allowed to be objectively beautiful anymore
why did they make lara look like justin trudeau
I dont really get how she looks ugly. its not a traditionally feminine face  but she s still a female  so...what s the issue  im also seeing comments about her being fat. her legs are thick  but thats really about it. I dont see an issue.
do men like it   yeah  do women like it   yeah  but do men like it though   ...yes  yeah  thats sexist  - feminists
looks like dirty harry
1994 hugh grant
looks like scott bakula  quantum leap  in drag .
man face lara    why     a trans-lara       does she have sideburns    ok so if an artist makes this as their final version and presents it to what I assume will be a committee of at least 3 to 5 people who is at fault here   the artist for making something bad and genuinly ugly   well kinda ...but the real villains here are the group that approved this monstrosity ! who are these people
is she wearing uggs

I understand that conventional beauty is stupid but making lara look more masculine isn t helping.
transcroft.
she s not ugly  she s trans. look at that jaw!
she has a chiseled face.
what the actual fuck did they do  its obviously lara from the neck down  but with the face of ted mosby.
yikes dude
my eyes my eyes
thats not a girl next door. that is a man!
just make lara croft look like melonie mac.....problem solved
omg!
is this the new trans lara line
I dont have lara s trademark full lips  she s gotta have that!
@melonie mac go boom  I still think you d make a perfect lara croft
isn t it hilarious how being fat and ugly is representative of all women but if a man has a single flaw like a  50 000 income he s considered inadequate
I dont know what s  the obsession with lara and the dinosaurs !  like  .. where are the mummy s   the atlantean monsters  the fiamma nera   the ninjas  from tr iv ..  looks like they only know dinosaurs
yeah  all thatstatue is missing is a tom selleck mustache.  it looks like a statue of a dude cosplaying lara.  Im sure the 2nd option they had was lara with a stupid hair cut and some neon highlighter color in it.  yeah  this statue looks like a larry to me.  larry croft.  hard pass for me on this one.
the face looks like charlie sheen.  this just makes me sick!   also  those boots look a bit too big compared to her legs.
they made her a plain jane college feminist.
that is adam scott in drag
thats the head of a man.
let me guess  thatstatue was created by one of those people who dont know what a woman is and because of that  created this abomination.
rise best
thats not lara its a man  baby yeah lol
when r u going 2b live on twitch again its been a wile
so lara s a bloke in drag now
I said it looks like a dude  the second I saw it.
thats not lara croft. its tom cruise in a crap wig
larry croft
she has really huge boots  its horrible.
I hate how they keep making her face look like a guy instead of a female character its weird af.
is that fucking aaron hanson from game grumps
they made lara trans
lara looks like drake bell in that picture. gross.
right!!!
they give her a man face
what the heck !
is this a mcfarlane toy  if this is todd s  work Im gonna be super disappointed .
its a man  baby!
so looks like they repurposed a pile of cowboy beebop  spike  action figures for the abomination above. I can hear the marketing team conversation  damn that woke garbage cowboy beebop show flopped  didn t see that coming    yeah  wtf are we gonna do with all these spike figurines. thought they d sell like hot cakes. .  weeeellll  those tomb raider fans are suckers right  mod the bod and we ll make  em lara for the next lgbtqaI - xyz  pnis  edition
curious how you feel about horizon zero dawn forbidden west uglification of alloy. it is like she has the head of a 300lb plus woman that doesnt match up with her body. it is so obvious it is intentional. it is hard to want to play the game with such an ugly character. maybe I am sexist and shallow .
I didn t buy shadow of the tomb raider they gave it away on epic games store and thank God because they lost me. people need to stop buying this crap or it wont stop.
mmmh  would be prettier with a beard!
the next lara croft is going to be trans. they re just getting everyone used to the idea by this.
the guy next door
reeeeee male gaze reeeeeeee
horrible lara statue .but . kinda accurate drake bell  at least from that front profile
crossdresser lara
your verse of the day.  john 11 35.  Jesus wept.  there  how hard was that
even rock candy figures look better than this  so anyone saying that is part of the problem.
heresy in the eyes of the God emperor.
is that a transgender lara croft at 0 27 if you look at the image while thinking of a man  and if you ignore the body  lara croft doesnt look so bad as a dude.
lara croft was the epitome of womanhood... and they turned her into a man.
this looks like a guy trying to cross dress as lara croft  even if its  40  put some effort into it. Ive seen dolls for cheaper that are way more beautiful!
crystal dynamics dont deserve lara.
hahahahaha omg  this shit cant be real. thats a fake right ... right !
lara croft  she look a like a man edition.
lara looks like a man!
did they make lara a dude
aty least they didn t make her trans....yet.
ya  nah. got the face of the emotional damage guy. big fan of that guy but I never wanted to see him with long hair and breasts.
thats  am I incorrect in thinking that looks like a transgender aladdin  frag it  Im just going to come out with it and say thats a transgender lara  I suspect they plan on making her transgender  she has the hips of a man as well as the face.
thats a man  baby!
I hate those shoes   since legend lara have her shoes much higher I dont know why but its annoying for me and it looks so stupid. I wish lara would be again full of sexapeal big breast confident  pretty and unstopable. and acctually she was a lot like human in original games she climbed slow  realistic not jumping like spiderman she was also sleeping in game in some cutscenes..... I love that melonie acctually speak out about her apperance . new lara is terrible terrible terrible I still didnt finish shadow of tomb raider becouse I cant stand this new lara...... and believe me im one of biggest fans...
she needs to look like a man to do all those mannish things she does
bruh  she doesnt look like a woman no more.
couldn t they just do their sh tty reboot lara  stop ruining classic lara. ever leave her dead and do thatsurvival garbage or do the original good as it is suppose to be.
its the trans lara   .they cant define a woman so how are they meant to emulate one
thats a man  baby.
surprise! lara croft has actually been a transwoman all along!
wtaf is that
maybe you should put a mustache on that poor excuse of an action figure
I dont think its an attack against lara tho its just these people that make the toys dont give a fuck the entire sculpt is just trash have you seen the state of  collectibles  now  especially at low price tags.
thats a man.
thatstatue looks like a crossdresser.  and I bet that was on purpose.
thats a man  baby!
looks like a dude for sure.  pisses me off as I am old enough to say I played the first one when it came out.  lol
that not chibI    save your money  and buy better merch
looks like a woke lgbt whatever version of lara .... here s pat  snl
lara crapt
is the girl next door a dude
its trans 100
wtf is that thing   it looks like a knock off.
thats a man
larry croft.its gotta be a dude because where are the signature breastesses  those are chest muscles. I think they are going after any and everything thatsymbolizes femininity and masculinity.
ewwwww...
its a statue of trans larry
that face....why transgender croft
its predictable as always.getting boring now cultists.
she looka like a man. miss swann.
so lara croft looks like a grizzled post office vet  obI won kenobI is now bi-sexual and gta vI will be racially sensitive. I dont even know why Im remotely surprised.you know what the kicker is  if people dont watch queer star wars we wont get any star wars. if we dont buy new tomb raider or gta games they will shelve the series  for a decade  and take the older games off virtual shelves. we re almost at the point where people who sell their ip will need to put  these characters cannot have their sexuality changed in any form of media  these character traits must be upheld  the character may only be killed off through old age  these characters may not be race swapped in any type of media.  itseems absolutely outlandish  but these self loathing bigots have the creativity of rocks and racism that would make clansmen and black panthers alike say  whoah  now thats taking it too far.  if artists dont want their creations absolutely shredded for a hundred or so upvotes on twitter  they are going to need to start adding clauses like this. pretty sad  but nothing compared to the gaping empty hole in the personalities of the people responsible for this type of nonsense.
at this point why dont they just have lara to transition to be a man since the woke considers sexy feminine women to be haram.
its a man s face with a wig. maybe ran out of female parts.....lol
she ain t ugly she s trans how dare you bigot!!
thats a man.
looks like bootleg copy from china
literally looks like a man...
yeah  thatstatue looks butt ugly.
all the pieces in that line are intentionally ugly. its the intentional stylization for the line of figures. please go check the rest out so you can see. it is in fact ugly but its not ugly because of wokeness in this case. please check out the other statues so you can confirm. the line is called minI epics.
that looks like a dude.
this is desecration   I will speak with my money  and everyone else should too  I wont be buying  this crap
it totally looks like a guy. and what s with the boots
thats beyond ugly  it hurts my eyes!
it looks like a guy. it just looks like a guy dressed in women s clothing.
is this part of the cancel culture woke thing  or is just bad art her face looks like a man though...
I hope no one goes out and buy this because the next is she ll be transgender. its nostalgic  so any deviation will ruin that nostalgia.
notice how the face looks vaguely masculine  itseems very much not a girl  but some cross-dresser in a costume... also yes eww.. btw I am a guy and I find that... revolting... make it better dude  I know you can hope you have a great day   safe travels!
it looks like a dude
looks like a dude
how on earth did that design get through all the greenlighting process s to go to production without anybody noticing it looks like a dude!wtf!
looks like a  dude
looks like a dude
who designed this  its so bland! are we sure thats not a repurposed model  its so bad!
its such a shame that youve just ended up having to rely on  controversial opinions  to get clicks. you ve become such a negative shell.
