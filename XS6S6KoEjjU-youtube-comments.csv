knowing netflix s impeccable track record with anime to live-action Im sure it ll be fine.
I watched the one scene they published as a teaser for the netflix movie. all itshowed was that they fundamentally did not understand the characters  their dynamics or the themes of the story. all in one scene meant to get people excited for it.light being given the death note  egged on by ryuk to use it to kill classmates.. so light didn t randomly pick it up and begin killing people on his own accord  ryuk is an a five agent instead of a non-partisan onlooker  and its about the plot device instead of philosophical questions like  what determines justice .. so much butchering of the ip in three minutes.
you cant ruin something thatstill exists in all its glory. go watch read death note  pretend this doesnt exist.
glad to know you saved us melonie!
I didn t even realise that there was a live action adaptation of death note other than the japanese one until very recently.I thought that was the one people were hating on  and it confused me  as the japanese live action is not all that horrible.
for every castlevania  and  debateably  the witcher  there s a cowboy bebop or death note to negate the good work. cowboy bebop live action was... a fantastic trainwreck that I wish never existed. never cared for death note so I never saw the movie  but heard a lot of negatives around it. I really hope the upcoming cyberpunk anime they commissioned is going to hit  judging from the trailers itshould but you never know.
the first 2 japanese live action adaptations are really good. I actually like the way they ended them better than the anime ending. also lol at writing netflix in the notebook.
they literally ruined light. but if they actually actually follow the story and cast a japanese person for light I will be happy. hopefully they learned their lesson.
I kinda liked the netflix deathnote movie but I didn t even find out it was anime manga until well after I d seen it and Ive never read the source material  plus Im a total normie when it comes to pretty much anything in the anime genre . thatsaid  Imiss when finding out netflix was doing something was exciting. they had a decent run for a little while.
how many times do we need to teach you this lesson  old man
I remember first discovering the death note anime series. I was hooked. it was so good!
e r suffered through the netflix movie so we didn t have to. he tore it to shreds lol you gotta watch those videos  mel!
I just want to watch death note clips on youtube  why do I have to constantly be reminded that netflix is making another death note live action movie  !!!
if the duffer brothers are behind it it might not so bad. they re the ones behind the stranger things show which is pretty good imo.
for what it is worth  I suspect someone wrote  netflix stock  in their death note....
in all fairness dont blame netflix for these adaptations as most are being made by japanese studios who in turn license them to netflix for worldwide distribution. example being the new live fullmetal alchemist movie.
honestly Im so terrified for one piece  the cast looks great and seem passionate for the story  the sets actually look pretty great imo but that death note movie broke me. I dont know how you can fuck up an adaptation thats in a realistic setting so badly and yet they expect us to believe they can do something as ridiculous and cartoonish like one piece. alita battle angel to my knowledge is probably the only good  adaptation we ve had. in recent years anyway.
I knew this was coming as soon as I saw the twitter post you made about it. I say let em keep making their garbage netflix originals and hopefully they will eventually go broke as a result seeming practically all of their originals perform horribly.
hello  mel. Imust be honest  one of the good things I love about netflix is that its america s new home to the  power rangers.  of course  Im not judging you or anyone else. keep up the good work!
you dont even have to write their name in the death note.just look up their stock price rn.
I agree.
hell the japanese live action series is really good. all 3 movies
just keep everything the anime did and only ryuk from the movie then it ll be fine by me.
its doesnt need to be a japanese person to be playing light as long they put on the characteristics and attitude in the anime to the live action it would be no problem but they failed in the long run with bad writing and attempting to change the original story inorder to look original which is a huge bs
@silentjazz lightÂ  I only like race swapping if they find someone perfect like nicks fury.
I believe that the differ brothers can do a good job on this. they are probably also somewhat a fan of anime and probably likes death note if they wanna do an adaptation of it. why do I think that they would want to make a good adaptation od death note  well that is because their insperation for stranger things is the movie akira so in that way we allready know that they somewhat like anime and why would they make a death note adaptation if they did not like it  they probably want to do the series justice by making a good adaptation so people who dont like anime would get to experience thatstory
to be fair their live action movie was pretty good  so there s hope for the series
when I saw the announcement it reinforced why I will never watch netflix again.
I kinda liked the netflix one! its really not that bad.
like I do with all netflix live action adaptions of books   anime  Im going to pretend it doesnt exist. I dont even have netflix anymore thankfully.
they didn t learn their lesson the first time huh  netflix really needs to leave anime adaptations alone. deathnote wasn t my favorite anime  but I thought it was very good especially the suspense  it can make a great movie if the writers would take itseriously.
death note has so much potential. well we cant do anything so Imma just wait and see. btw I didn t know death note was your favorite series  youreally should check out one piece.
how canthey ruin something so big  dont understand how they can destroy a classic manga. cant you just watch something and tell its trash  good way to lose membership s being half assed. also  yes you need to watch stranger things. great show!
my gosh. Ive been following you for the sole reason that I suspected you had one of the death notes. and now that its been confirmed. please dont write my name in it. I agree 100 . Im not gonna waste my time on the live action series. the only thing that looks appealing to me is the talisman. I love stranger things but I dont have a lot of faith they ll get a spin off right or whatever they re doing with it.
dang  I just re-subbed on netflix because they were starting to clean up their act.
even ryuk was bad  they made him to push light to using the book and even get angry when he refuses.
gosh  youre so freaking adorable melonie.
melonie put some disclaimers on here over that death note.
I hadn t watched death note in any shape or form  but the anime looked way superior to more or less all the live-action adaptations. very much in the same way that hollywood tarnished street fighter. to be clear  the true warrior can be found entering the arena with all of his powers in the anime!by the way  look up psalm 55 22 - always one I go back to when needing to find comfort in times of distress  Imiss your Bible verse of the day segments. . . . .but  its your channel  you can do whatever the heck you want. keep going boom  melonie!
netflix is determined to make subpar anime adaptations
thats so awesome lol tomorrow headlines are going to be filled with news about how netflix studios started to mysteriously go up in flames as the local fire department could only watch in awe as the fire hoses only seemed to add to the size of the fires
I am not a big anime fan. but I watched a few and death note was among them. really enjoyed the show. but I think for some anime its better not to be adopted as a live action show or movie.same goes for games.for some it might work with the right people behind it but for the most part it wont work.
netflix is going to destroy itself.
Im not sure hmif there has ever been a decent live action adaptation
if you have any hope that they might redeem themselves
lmao. why would yourecommend one piece to someone who likes death note
netflix has a favorite hobby of ruining old animes.
@c j
simple...shiteflix are in blackrock s over sagging pocket.
dunno if you play dbd but I would love to hear about the nurse backstory and david king sexual orientation situations!
just wait till you take a look at the re-imagination of trigun... I am dead inside now...
learning is definitely not in netflix s vocabulary.
netflix exec 1   hey  we garnered some semblance of respect back for stranger things s4  how can we destroy this very fragile trust  netflix exec 2   Ive got it!  lets make live action death note! netflix exec 1   didn t we already do that  and really poorly  netflix exec 2   exactly! netflix exec 1   nice... let s get it greenlit asap.
oof! you done messed up now netflix. I knew melonie would handle it now we dont have to worry about them ruining our favorite anime anymore! rip too those we lost along the way.. you were gone too soon
Imiss the  what is up my boomers!   and the daily verse. go boom videos just feel off without those bookends.
am I the only one who thinks that no adaptation can ruin the original  its a different thing. even if its the worst thing ever recorded  the original is still there. whether its worth watching or a waste of time however is another thing  but Im open to dipping my toe in and seeing what they do. but its their risk alot of the time these adaptations will probably flop and be a huge waste of money.
Im pretty sure there is a page in there with crystal dynamics  name written on it too  right
we already have a great live action death note series...in japan. all 3 movies
I wouldn t be surprised if they ruined the darkness and witchblade and make them bad netflix movie adaptations
short and sweet  and I noticed that u dropped the verse of the day segment melo
stranger thing is worth getting back into  s3 was weak but 4 ended out very strong
meanwhile the netflix headquarters just collapsed. melonie! xd
idk when are these people gonna learn anime fans hate their live action portrayal. I personally never seen death note but my nephew is a massive fan
now to monetize on their failure and make some
go boom .  love it.
not sure what its gonna take for them to give up on the anime adaptations. death note  bebop  one piece is gonna be trash Im sure. wouldn t it just be easier and more profitable to re-air the anime   also  called todays topic  when melonie tweeted about this  lol .
who knew it was possible to kill a show by writing a name  lol
death note is the holy grail of anime for me  andnetflix already ruined it once. this is blasphemy heresy I say. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
I dont have to worry about netflix.  I got rid of my account after the  cuties  bs.
Imade a video about the david king thing here on my channel
does she not do it anymore  she took a long time away from this channel  like 3 months   and I dont have twitter. is she officially not doing it anymore
@anthony harrichanÂ  lately  no  not really.
they should make original cartoons anime  not by woke losers  and call it a day. but its easier to use an established ip then take a chance and make something that can potentially be good.
same!!! even though I wanted to watch sailor eternal and spy racers  both were released after cuties blasphemy  but I d rather wait until they d get sold somewhere
@seahawkerinoÂ  the only thing I was keeping it around for was  castlevania  before the whole  cuties  controversy.  but even that went to crap  thanks to season 3.
@jonathan herbertÂ  I wish heartstopper and spy racers were available anywhere other thatshitflix
its so stupid how hollywood wants more diverse shows movies  yet for live action anime its unacceptable. whenever its anime  the entertainment industry believes it has to be americanized in order for it to work. but thats all wrong! its just another example of hollywood being out of touch when it comes to geek or weeb culture. instead of being faithful  they use the brand name as a cash grab.
ok heres thing  I do believe death note is one of the few animes that could work in live action. death note is a mystery and crime anime and its rules are mostly grounded in reality. unlike something like dragonball which would just look stupid in live action.its just a shame that the westernized version of death note was so poorly written. so  yes I do want to see a reattempt of death note. it just needs competent writing.
melonie  check out the japanese live action movies  they decent. just steer clear of the live action series they did. steaming pile  sadly. even they can mess up.
melonie mac is the third kira  l knew all along.
every time they say its a live-action movie or show  its not a live-action movie or show. especially from hollywood! they made it clear they dont give a crap about the fans or the source material. this news wont make any difference. besides  they can false advertise in trailers just to trick you into seeing it. so why bother
netflix couldn t make a worthy death note live action motion picture... and couldn t make a worthy cowboy bebop live action series. so what makes them think this time will work  nothing outside of creating an entire new death note  like the actual notebook itself  will have a chance of working. heck  to go a bit further  the only way a live action death note series can actually work is if they do it true detective style... with a new author and new shinigamI in each season.but honestly  that makes too much sense for it to happen. so I ll just keep the originals of these two animes as the only legit ones in my head canon.
who actually wants this  please add the following to your death note book -disney-amazon-electronic arts-paramount-crystal dynamics
I like netflix watching sailor moon right now.
they should go back to altered carbon  which admittedly  deviated from the books but was still good  and marco polo. I cant say I am a fan of death note in any form  but even I could appreciate how badly they fucked that one up.
loved the video melonie
I liked death note anime first half was better then second for sure though
netflix and disney are just the graveyard of anything fun and cool. at first I didn t see it was an adidas shirt  I thought it was dallas cowboys. for a splitsecond I thought those years of living in texas had rubbed off and you had become a cowboys fan. my opinion of you is already high but as a cowboys fan it would have gone off the scale if I thought you had joined the legion of the blue and sliver. oh well  you cant get everything you want.
why are they trying to turn anime into live action shows
we already have a well-animated adaptation of the manga. nobody wants a live-action version
remember attack on titan live action  some things are never meant to be made.
nope. any anime adaptation  no. only reboot I want us katsuhiro otomo to produce an anime series faithfully adapting his manga series  akira.
netflix s death note is good in a void where original death note doesnt exist. when looked at as an adaptation  it is pretty bad  unfortunately    it would have done much better if it was its own ip and not pretending to be death note  which felt like what it was trying to do for some reason.
I really hope it is netflix cowboy bebop bad.
netflix trashing something beloved again not surprising to me while the dubbed will always be superior to live adaptations while  I ll take a chip and eat it
3 25 lmao! I hope yt doesnt take down your video.
better than the netflix version. the japanese live action actually have thought and plan by both light and l. unlike the netflix it hilarious make no sense.
protego sanctus causa!
the human who uses this note can neither go to heaven nor hell. that was a hellraiser-level mistake  melo!sidenote I did really enjoy a couple of the japanese live-action death notes.. not all of them though they all had their moments.. I think there s at least 5 jp live-actions out there
lmao netflix too desperate noe
I am old enough to have been alive back in the 00 s  and I remember that back then we used to think that the anime series was sub-par  because it had cut key aspects off when compared to the manga. what netflix is doing now is just dancing on its grave. I feel nothing towards this.
to ask this question I have to admit to being a bad fanboy...bad!!! I only watch the vids that have a topic I think might interest me. anyway the question  when did her your intro change. this one you said something about it being a nerdy channel. you used to call it a social commentary channel  when did that change
it will be even worse now  since netflix has gotten even more woke since the original terrible adaptation released.
Im not a big anime person at all  but I have watched the original death note. it was great! leave it alone
the japanese live action tv series  not movie series  is way better than the live action movies but I haven t finished them.
Im not even religious but I gotta say I do miss the Bible verse of the day and your comments on them.
did they not learn from the movie or recently fake cowboy bebop.
death note anime is one of my fave anime to watch love the thrilling mystery keep anime out of live action please
they did an excellent job with cowboy bebop. Im sure their rendition of death note will be spectacular.
no  no  no. bad netflix  we said drop it!
you made a good decision to avoid watching it mel  and yes willem dafoe as ryuk was the only good thing about the entire movie.
for the algorithm!
honestly melonie  Im not a death note fan much.the closest thing to me would be castlevania judgement as takashI obata did the art for that game and people despise it for making simon belmont look like light yagami.I heard the original japanese live action death note was pretty good.but anime movies should be made by someone who gets what makes it great. not some cash grab live action adaptation like cowboy bebop got.I really hope they dont do flcl
they ruined bastard!!  anything an american company tries to adapt from japan recently is ruined.  the original dub back in the 90s was sooooo much better.  I loved the early parts of the manga  but it changed to cliche shojo after awhile and it just lost its dark  adult  and unique style.
netflix must be destroid
melonie  have you seen the chosen
Imissed your face in these type of videos.  adidas
soo you like 20 something
@I oÂ  lol
to netflix  https   youtu.be svxj016xb4q
what happened to the verse of the day
netflix......thank you for stranger things really thank you but you need to keep your dirty hands off anime okay
God damn not again...
mac  babe  if you thought the netflix gig was terrible  do not watch the japanese l a flicks from the 00s.
bastard! and edgerunners is going to be fire.
I think you created this video just to show us that you have the power to end anyone we your death note. netflix Im so sorry
what about panty and stocking
why  they made a movie the death note anime and manga have been completed for years in fact the authors new manga is already in full swing and has a completed anime
maybe they might learn from their mistakes
it might work better if you put a sheet over you   cry over   over  leave death note alone
damn they didnt even do anything but say they wanted to work on it. at least wait till theres a trailer to start dog piling it. im sure the duffers will do it the justice it deserves.
netflix will never learn from their flops. Im very afraid about the tomb raider anime thats supposed to come out next year.
william dafoe was the only good thing about that movie and I didn t even know that was william dafoe.
talisman book was good.. but they ll ruin it!
love ya
Im not the biggest fan of death note  but they need to stop trying to ruin itso much
they never learn.
the story is done death note doesnt need a remake or a revisioning Im tired of it happening
Im one of the weirdos who liked the netflix death note movie. but Im not a huge fan of the anime manga. dont hate it  just haven t seen it.
dont jinx tomb raider
netflix will find some way to fuck that up
@makavelI shepardÂ  literally
tomb raider anime.. lol
I wish I didn t know this. the character development in the death note anime cannot be matched. the movie was stupid for thinking it could compete against it. I was so upset with my murder mystery fan coworker when she watched the movie. I told her not to! watch the anime first I said! but no... she ruined it for herself.
hey melonie I just want to say that why do netflix have to mess with a great and good anime show like death note for and destroy it  anyway I think that if netflix want to mess anything up on netflix then netflix needs to find a show that they can mess up and destroy on netflix  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to say that please netflix please just leave death note alone please netflix. anyway thanks netflix. have a great evening at home with your pets melonie and have a good night too melonie.
I liked dark crystal  so they canceled that but trash like she-ra gets multiple seasons.
death note  really  Imean I enjoyed it a lot  but I think its time to let that one silently fade away.
what is on the table on your left behind you it looks shaggy sort of  this is my comment to help fight the algorithm.
netflix ruining another anime as usual.
they are ruining anime in general melonie
netflix  please stop. get some help.
this time with trans l!
oh please...dont ruin this anymore than you already have netflix...
they need to stop making these revolting live action adaptations   leave anime the hell alone!!!!
maybe we need to start boycotting trash
they ruin everything they touch. they just physically can not make good content anymore.
the first half of death note was great but the second half was kind of crap.
I watched 5 minutes of the live action and then immediately turned it off.
it takes a superpower to ruin death note   good grief
hey melonie  aren t you supposed to write how netflix dies  instead of just the name
to be honest death note is already a perfect anime. its story wouldn t be any better in live-action.were you disappointed with the netflix adaptation  watch this instead https   youtu.be ecspsmd84je
light will be a gay black man and l will be an assexual trans.
how tf did you guys not see this coming  I canceled after watching my favorite franchise  the witcher  become incoherent woke nonsense.
I think it would be better if netflix got the right to bring the live action movies from japan  and dub them with good actors. like the others they have done. most us audiences dont want to read a movie. squid game is a good example of a good dub. also alice in boarder land. I dont have the time to watch a movie and read it at the same time. one reason they remake movies for the usa. its going to happen  if you like it or not.
you dont have to write cause of death. it ll just be heart attack unless you specify
@melonie mac go boomÂ  thats the thing  it doesnt have a heart.
I thought netflix was taboo after they released the disgusting cuties show..
the only good adaptations were the rurounI kenshin ones because they were done by asians. westerners are just going to ruin these animes tbh.
the west must not interfere with asian media. the best films come from asia  western films are generic money making slop that you forget in a heartbeat. I will say independent cinema though are excellent and some very brilliant people from the west create them but for the most part the gritty realistic depiction of reality is best from foreign language films. sorry folks the west isn t as good as you thought it was get your head our your ass and experience culture.
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
first
deathnote is overrated garbage
death note sucked  not worried about that.
