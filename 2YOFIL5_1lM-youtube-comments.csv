galadrial was a being of awe-inspiring grace and beauty. her power wasn t in strength of arms. this ain t it.
we dont share that anatomy  is the greatest answer anyone could have given to why that looks so ridiculous. unfortunately we have the left who says  women  can have the same anatomy as men nowadays. glad there are more people speaking out against things like this. keep it up!
she s a mage! you just cant reroll warrior.  this is terrible. did they even read the silmarillion    respect the source material!!
its like giving superman a machine gun just because he ll look cooler or something.
warrior manspreading galadriel  and the accompanying photo is hilarious. look at how serious and cool she s trying to look  everyone. like a 12-year-old edgeLord you see in old internet photos.
well  its happened.  peter jackson s legolas is now officially more feminine than amazon s galadriel.
she s an elf  she s female  she s a noble  she s super feminine... yeah  drop that detroit thug pose  just perfect  ...  what
that pose just goes to prove that they are making female characters into men  and to go further male characters into women. except it is the most negative stereotypes. female characters are now confrontational  rude  none emotional  and some how able to take out men 3 times their size. meanwhile the male characters are emotional  weak  crying all the damn time  constantly getting their asses kicked  groveling. its like all the accusations of male and female characters and yet they think just switching them instead of addressing them  even though those accusations were way over blown  magically fixes the problem. no it doesnt  in fact it makes this uncanny valley that tells people thatsomething is off and makes these worlds unbelievable. there is nothing wrong with masculine and feminine traits  but you cant just switch them around and expect the audience to not notice.
galadriel wasn t a warrior  she didn t wear armor or use a sword and fight in the field of battle  she was more like a mage style character that uses magic  she had one of the rings of power . I just dont understand how they can get the lore so wrong. they clearly dont understand fantasy at all.
remember  frodo and sam weren t the warriors of the story  yet they re heroes. these people seems to not understand knowing how to fight doesnt nescessarily mean youre the most important. in rpg games  there s always optimal to have at least 1 healer in the party  1. you can have all the warriors you want but 1 healer is enough to keep all of them alive  are you sure is the warrior that is bad ass
remember when galadriel was a mystical  magical  regal  dignified  and beautiful queen of the elves  who did not need to do anything to command loyalty because people just instantly and permanently loved her   yeah  those were good times.  good times indeed.
love your videos meloniemac!  I especially appreciate the verse of the day and how you are bold to talk about your faith. keep doing what youre doing.
could you imagine cate blanchett manspreading in her robes   me neither.
most of the tomboys I canthink of that are done right dont come from western media. tifa lockhardt from ff7  chie from persona 4  samus aran  not sure if she counts as tomboy but she is a legitimate bad ass female   natsuno from 13 sentinels  and though actually western in origin  lara croft is one that is done very much well. Im sure there are others that just escape me but eastern media has tons of them
love the colossians verse you shared! reminds me of the set of aims and values for a gospel choir I was once part of - and they were based on similar verses from the same letter  specifically chapter 3 verses 12-14. its such a wonderful reminder that God chose us to holy and dearly loved  and how thatshould be demonstrated in our relations to other people  particularly within the church.thanks so much  melonie!
hip adductor abductor machines. the abductor muscles spread your thighs apart  the adductor muscles pull your thighs together. you also have rotator muscles to twist your thigh in the hip socket.Im just a mechanic  but I believe that your body s joints contain flexors to bend the joints  extensor muscles to straighten the joint  rotator muscles to pivot the joint  adductors to swing the joint inwards fingers and thighs   and abductors to splay the joints outwards.if youre using machines for leg exercises  its important to do adductor abductor exercises so that those muscles can handle the extra strength of your legs. if youre doing squats  deadlifts  or other free weight full muscle group exercises  the entire muscle group will grow proportionally and you wont need focused adductor abductor exercises.
just cant imagine a battle hardened dogged face warrior would suddenly embrace ultimate feminity and just bury away all the masculine behavior.... it just doesnt make sense..
galadriel is supposed to be this wise all powerful angel like figure not this man-spreading warrior.
I remember growing up in the 1980s and 90s when a photo from a film or television program was the highlight of the day! now  I dont think anyone at all is sitting with bated breath for anything to do with films or tv.
I have a theory. amazon doesnt own the rights to the second age. I think they are pulling a 180 on the characters to avoid getting sued into oblivion. if they made the characters true to the literature  there would be a slid case for the owners of the second age books and stories.
the lesser-known character mansprealadriel otoh...
@harbl99  lol
@harbl99  sounds like cheap bootleg.
so youre saying she cant be a strong woman
@george chapman  magic ungabunga
@george chapman  she is already a strong woman.
@queen beruthiel  but surely manspreading and armour wearing are the only ways a female character can be strong   no one thinks a white mage can be a badass
I get that mostly man do a  manspread  but I seen enuf guys sit with there leggs over one another to know that a manspread or a woman legg over is not limited to the sexes I seen some woman do a manspread and I seen some men do the woman legg thing if we are for equality of men and woman then why are we not allowing men or woman to set however they want this conversation seems rather detremental to equality of choice.
@the veggster good day  a girl can sit with her legs spread  but this is just so exaggerated and redilculous.
this is fanfic
@visitor  its really not. tolkien fans know better.
she did a skill re-spec for the third age.
@visitor  its woke political activism.
of course they didn t read the source material  that would be too restricting for them to tell the story they want to tell. why be accurate when its easier to just shit all over it instead

they also dont have the licensing for that  they only have the licensing for the hobbit and the original trilogy.
only if you have a larval tear.
@visitor  hate fiction
they aren t able to use stuff from the silmarillion for the show.  there is only certain materials they are allowed to use like the lotr movies and hobbit movies
wb is going to hire you so fast with merch ideas like that. every little kid will want the new kryptonian compressed-air gatling-gun toy.
she s a great type-b female character . she can do no wrong
does thst mean she becomes a paladin then   like a warrior and mage or no   im not sure what s happening
now is dual-class  first levels  warrior....
bro  the way these waaamen hero s try to act tough us so laughable.  as tough as ripley was  she never had that  fake-tough  persona.  and how about liv tyler in lotr    she was a powerful character but moved with grace.  detaching from their femininity makes women look weak   not strong.
its ma am xd
hahahaha
well  it was orlando bloom.  there was never that big a difference  even in the jackson films.
elvish gang tats as well or nah
yep
omg read books
she s the whole party!!!
cate blanchett has more class in her pinky finger than everyone involved in this dumpster fire.
trying not to but now I cant unthink it
@visitor  same
its because us who are eastern cultures  asia  southeastern and eastern europe  etc  value strength of character rather then physical strength when it comes to women. strong women is one who is smart  resourceful and has conviction  not one who can lift in gym. anyone can bulk up and get physically strong  but it takes lot more conviction and willpower to be mentally strong. with strong mind usually comes strong body as well.
I d agree with you if it weren t for the 180 thats been pulled on marvel  dc  star wars characters at the same time.
amazon owns the hobbit  the Lord of the rings  but not the silmarillion. there is other source material they may may not own. after chris tolkien died the estate sold out  this is to the best of my knowledge.
yesterday was leg day and Im still feelin it. I did the murph on monday and Im walking like a granny today  three days later.but it was totally worth it.
after the last patch  I d love to swap my mage to warrior...but you cant do that in wow either
at the risk of sounding like a puritan.... a woman spreading her legs for a photographer does not make me think  oooh a tough warrior.   it just makes me think she got lost looking for a maxim photoshoot.
all of galadriel s learnings from yavanna herself  just for to pose like a badass man.  thanks   amazon
what s also sad is this character could be good  or at least interesting  if this wasn t lotr or galadriel.
I dont know how a young galadriel was meant to be  but  young elfs are rebellious  belligerents  energetics. wisdom and peace of mind comes to them with years. so  I imagine galadriel didn t born that way but was acquired from experience.
you know what makes tomboy girls really cute and endearing  especially in anime  when the toughness gives way to soft femininity. its so adorable and sweet.
haven t watched a video from you in a while and my God you put on so much lean muscle. congrats whatever you are doing its working
its breathtaking hearing someone talk about the scriptures as its meant to be. ultimately we live by the guidelines to be good people  and not misinterpret the easy to understand instructions. ultimately its there to instruct us to not be an asshole  and yet so many fail to understand. keep doing what your doing mel  youre doing Gods work.
they could have created their own crappy product  but instead they chose to subvert tolkien. dunking on the rings of power is gonna be hilarious for the foreseeable future.
our thoughts are louder and more powerful than we realize.  if we understood just how loud and powerful they were  we would most certainly guard them more carefully.  while also being more conscious of them
at least being a hard working like that is better than being lazy. I bow my head in shame.
galadriel was one of the more big league characters in lotr. making her a xena knockoff is taking the character down a couple steps.
who the hell puts a white mage as a knight
when you said praying in your head was viable  it tickled me. I do this mostly before sleeping at night. I try to keep it about asking help for others. Im pretty sure I read  that is what is good.
galadriel  the only way to be power is to become a manly warrior! y stola  far be it for me to challenge your fragile masculinity.
hollywood either doesnt know how to make strong believable female characters anymore or they dont care and its becoming insufferable. apparently the new generation never saw alien or terminator  thats how you make strong female leads who are believable. they overcame a lot of adversity and by the time the sequels came out I believed thatsarah connor could rip my face apart in between doing sets of pull ups.
elrond wouldn t be caught dead sitting like that
I was sceptical trying gfuel at first.  now  its my go to when I need a drink.  also  those empire covers for lotr  the rings of power are all cringe !
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.  jrr tolkien
now I have to clean up the mess where I spit my drink out... lol...
yeah  this is typical  model pose number  xx  not  warrior pose . I trained both martial arts and buhurt  medieval fighting   you wouldn t even be able to get into that pose with actual armor. its not really the most flexible pair of pants.
empire went from reviewing films to opinion pieces on race  feminism  trump  brexit  whatever new thing they are meant to be mad with the right about  like 5 years ago.
what s in g-fuel exactly
that pose she is in says    my libido is high and my morals are low .   edit   I should also add the character s name should be changed from  galadriel  to  ga-laid-riel.
I think she wanted to have briana from game of thrones. that must be it 100   since they wanted their got show. problem is this is not how it is done!
anyone with half a brain already knows that galadriel is a beautiful and  powerful elf. I dont know who the character on that magazine is though.
hey melonie I just want to say that I think that this new series of ring of power is going to be awful and bad and I think that it will have a very bad reviews on this new movie or tv series and so I just want to tell you that and say that warrior galadriel is not good fit for this new show series or movie of ring of power  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that you are doing just a great job with this new video streaming and I really like your Bible verses that you preach and read to us every day. anyway keep it up and I am so happy for you too melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie. anyway God bless you melonie.
galadriel is one of the most powerful characters in middle earth.she doesnt need armor or a sword.I like how the actress looks and I think she would make great galadriel.but whoever wrote her for this show ruined it.
its okay. the rings of power is set in a different universe with the silver timeline.
what they ve done to galadriel is enough to get me to skip amazon s fanfic. nevermind that don lemon hairstyle elf garbledygook.
not sure the silmarillion ever talked about the noldor in plate armor.
in the past year  Ive been booted from groups for  star wars  star trek  babylon 5  dc marvel  playstation  and Lord of the rings this morning  and I couldn t be happier.
I suppose if you played the blade of galadriel  it would make sense  if the character was a woman possessed by a male wraith.
God  I wish I had time to teach this but in a nutshell when able  we should always pray out loud. our authority in the earth is only exercised when we speak. praying in your mind is nice and when casting your cares on the Lord is perfectly fine  but when you want to take authority over a situation  your voice has to be heard.
gotta love a train wreck!!!
is galadriel using a chamber pot
they hate men but they think everything about them is great  - disparu  critical drinker after hours
so powerful
in their world there is not difference in the anatomy  its just power-pose  so she must do it
she looks super adolescent for 5000 years old
so I was thinking about what you said and that person suggested  and I started to pray every day and out loud... I like it! youre supposed sing praise to the heavens for God almighty  aren t you  pray out loud! melonie  I wish you could meet my mom. she is a scholar in the Bible s teaching without being too weird about it. I aspire to be like her in a lot of ways. she doesnt preach too much  she s just like well this is what it is  and thats where I stated the body is the temple thing with you. it wasn t to crap on you. it was just this is what it is lol    believe me I am a sinner myself  and I do so many things wrong.
when I see a woman sitting like that  I expect to hear her speak like robin  cobie smulders  how Imet your mother
I guess its some modern weirdo interpretation that having important female warriors in fantasy often being magical instead of physical fighters is  sexist  even though in most of the universes where this trope plays out  female magical fighters are equal to or often greater than their male physical fighter counterparts in terms of raw power.
well  galadriel did sleep with frodo in the unfilmed john boorman lotr script from the 1970s....no  thats not a joke. it actually happened. and its even dumber in context.
@reid mason      maybe it is just as well he only did zardoz and excalibur.
@reid mason  was he going to cut it together weird like excalibur too   sounds more like he thought he was filming bored of the rings...
@joseph fisher  the script is 178 pages long  so a ton of stuff was cut out. what s left of the story is very rushed. as far as weird editing goes  the only spot that might qualify is a moment where an insanely jealous gimlI accidentally nicks himself while sharpening his axe  and his pained grunts are intercut with frodo s sex noises. yes  youread that correctly. and no  it isn t any better in context. other stuff in the boorman script includes - arwen as a perpetual 13-year old  paving the way for eowyn to hook up with aragorn- aragorn healing the wounded eowyn on the battlefield by having sex with her on the spot  the scene reads like  strokin  the love muffin  from the naked gun movies - the backstory of the one ring being told at the council of elrond via a kabukI rock opera circus performance  featuring a mick jagger-like sauron and a femme fatale version of saruman- lembas bread tasting like whatever you imagine at any given moment...which leads to a really gross scene where a horny merry imagines it tasting like galadriel- almost all of the fellowship angling to score with galadriel  legolas  dressed in feathers and leaves  doing a bird-like mating dance  boromir baring his muscles and trying to make out with her  it doesnt go well   sam telling her she s  a very pretty flower that badly needs watering   gimil doing axe tricks and calling her  a mighty piece of stone for a dwarvish tool to carve ...and complaining about how unfair it is that frodo scores with her instead- the real saruman and gandalf having a pointless  who s on first -style verbal battle that even saruman realizes is stupid- scenes of the heroes getting trashed on magic mushrooms and magic whiskey- gandalf verbally and physically abusing gimlI in order to awaken his ancestral memories to get the password to moria- no fell beasts or any flying creatures  the nazgul use a skinless  bloody undead horse insteadthe script s hosted on reddits r lotr forum  if you want to look it up. but be warned  its not going to make any sense.
@reid mason  I was thinking of the excalibur sex scene that was filmed in two pieces  one side parading boorman s hot then-wife s top half and the other being arthur s dad pretending to hump a pillow while wearing full armor.thatsounds way more than completely out of control and why he did bother turning it in to a studio  were there people who thought thatstuff like the dirty cinderella movie was going to become a norm
@joseph fisher  boorman had a deal with united artists at the time  he d pitched an early version of excalibur to them  so they thought he could handle lotr as well. they were not prepared for how incoherent and insane the script was  however.thatsaid  it could have been worse still. boorman s co-writer rospo pallenberg wanted to have a scene where frodo visited a magical whorehouse  but that got nixed early on. there s enough crazy in this script as is.
@reid mason   so exactly bored of the rings  then  disclosure  I have only read approximately the first three pages . I am getting the impression that they needed to cut way back on their consumption of porn. or consume more and work it all out. one or the other.
what happened with b5
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   I wasn t a big fan of the remake appearing on the cw. Im a dc fan  so I spoke from experience of felicity and friends  and  we are the flash
@ancestor empire      do you mean the new version jms is creating
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   yep. and jms ain t the same jms of old. he makes mark hamill looks sane.
@ancestor empire      okay  thanks.  I never watched his show sense8  but based on what I have heard about it I do not think I would have cared to.   hope for the best and expect the worst.  that way you will never be disappointed.
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   that quote just reeks of nihilism.
@ancestor empire      seems like a good general life philosophy to me...
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   then youre actually lowering your standards for living.
@ancestor empire      it is 2022  and I am 61 years old.   nuff said...
regarding the thing about someone saying demons aren t telepathic  eh its like they probably are. like with  intrusive thoughts  and so many trolls sounding the same  and demonic possession oppression  it would seem to indicate they d have some access to human minds. they would be fallen angels  the same kind of beings physiologically whatever that would be  so probably angels also would have the same basic abilities. either way though  despite however powerful such creatures are  they fear God and are limited in their set of actions by him. so  whether praying internally or externally  it doesnt matter who s eavesdropping.
the rangs oof pawa  behold the ideal woman... a man.
bezos wanted his game of thrones without watching the damn thing  because warrior women were few and far between in the show.
can guarantee grimes is salivating over that cover lol
galadriel was the only real powerful female character and I cant believe they wrecked her.
tomboys are great. the explanation btw why galadriel is like a tough boyish hyper emotional teen girl is thatshe is  only  2000 . she isn t 8000 yet. so that means she is a teenager  cause of course that is how it works.
ah yes  warrior galadriel  student of tulkas. oh wait  thats not right!
in all the shots  she s wearing the star of f anor. she despised f anor. she would never in a million years wear his emblem  the symbol of his house.
I wrote this show off the moment they said they weren t following the source material.
well  actually the most irritating thing about that cover for me  isn t the fact thatshes sitting like that. I ll be honest - sit how ever you like. simple as that.now does it fit the character  I have no idea. is it exactly  lady like   no. I think most people can agree to that. but do Imind nowadays  given the situation is appropriate  ofc I dont. why would I but the simple reality is  that there are women out there proclaiming that its somehow  sexist  or offending for men to sit like that. and while magazines are trying to enforce some kind of fictional narrative for the  strong and empowered  modern age women   they also show this on their cover.which only shows  that apparently no one has any kind of idea  what this  modern age  empowered woman is supposed to be or behave...
I have read through the main books at least 13 times and have read through the silmarillion and unfinished tales  and never  ever  has galadriel appeared as such a character in these works. she has always been a sorceress mage  who is fair  wise  and powerful. this doesnt look or feel like galadriel  it feels like a dollar general knock off.
at this point I think they pull woke shit because it guarantees hate-views from people who want to see how bad it actually is and from youtube reviewers.
youre right  there are many types of people in this world who call themselves Christians who neither behave as one or sound like one in their speech. Im not talking about those of us that lose our temper or stumble off the path despite our good faith efforts. Im talking about those who use the label of  Christian  to carry out evil deeds in God s name. melonie is right  those people are not Christians and there fore it is not our job to defend those people. melonie have you seen matt walsh s new documentary what is a woman  shocking evil in that movie. people who call themselves  moral  and commit unspeakable evil to small children and act as if they re righteous.
they re destroying every single franchise nowadays
hey  mel! the og galadriel was beautiful and surreal! this..... thing  is just abominable.
as someone only experience lotr though the middle earth games  why cant galadriel learn martial arts  are the elves balance
that armor looks like a baggy sweatshirt with yoga pants.
that much spread is uncomfortable for even a guy. its like maybe 25-50  of that is what guys will chill into sometimes. manspreading was exaggerated to create a stawman to get triggered about. I dont believe anybody ever encountered the examples that are shown.
galadriel   how do you do fellow dudes.
my main issue with the rings of power is that none of the elves look... elven. even the dudes. they just look like regular people with pointy ears  there s nothing ethereal about them  nothing immortally graceful. even during the siege of helm s deep with elves getting skewered and hacked up by uruk-haI they somehow managed to evoke a sense of magic and grace  when they died it gave the impression thatsomething rare and ancient was being snuffed out. how is it that they seemed so special in tlotr but they just look like fucking schlubs in rop  warrior galadriel just looks like some generic white chick fantasy protagonist  I do not get the sense of unfathomable wisdom and subtle but undeniable authority and power from her. she doesnt have the regal bearing necessary for the character  she s no cate blanchett but you dont need to be  you just need the right hair  make-up  costume design and direction. you cant just slap some prosthetic ears on a woman and expect her to look like what is essentially an angel.I will say the orcs look pretty good though  at least they re not cgi.
she s a teenager oh no no no. thats simply not true. not even close.
oh no in the second  age she  wold be  somwthing like 5000 6000 years old  more or less  the same age erlod  was  in the Lord  of the ring
sad yavanna  a le and melian noises
check unfinished tales again.  galadriel s mother named her  man-maiden   nerwen  in aman.  tolkien wrote thatshe was a match for the athletes of the eldar  as well as the loremasters   thatshe was an  amazon  who would tie up her hair.  most importantly here  she personally  fought fiercely  against her noldorin kin in defense of her telerin kin in the 1st kinslaying at alqualond . that gives the show s writers lots to work with.
@patrick   she was also named artanis  noble woman  by her father.
Ive wondered before about the significance of demons listening to our prayers  but I concluded it didn t matter. even if demons could stand to be nearby when we commune with Jesus  what are they gonna do  they literally have no power next to Jesus. you either mean what you say to and ask of Jesus or you dont. you either have faith or you dont.melonie  I found this channel a few months ago for the tomb raider commentary  but I stayed for the biblical commentary.  keep doing what youre doing.
re the manspreading  maybe she just tried a yoga meditation crosslegged in full plate armor  and gave up trying to get there halfway...  more seriously  I suspect this is meant to be visual code for  she s bI now.
Ive said it from day one. galadriel is a mage. why are they having her run around wielding a sword and wearing armor  she s not a warrior. they have proven they dont give a damn about lore or the fandom that actually give a damn. this is just another vehicle to push their wokeness ideology and destroy a beloved series while they are at it.
she s so strong she forged a ring just to abort little baby girl elves
I find myself praying in my thoughts more then with my words. Im a thinker and I often think about God. I try to pray out loud  but it never comes out right. Im not a great speaker.  Im a visionary. Im good at watching. Im good at thinking. but Im terrible at speaking. I cant trust my mouth. Ive been speaking to God with my heart for so long  its just as natural as breathing for me. I have social anxiety disorder. I dont like the sound of my own voice. my thoughts race faster in my head. so  when speak it  it doesnt come out clear. it comes out a jumbled mess. when I speak  I want my words to be genuine. Im not fake. I dont want to mimic what I think a Christian should sound like. I grew up in the church and itseemed like people who claimed to be Christian were putting on a show  when they prayed out loud. my father was one of those people and he was not a good person. I cant stand that. I dont want to be like that. I dont want to draw attention to myself.  I think God speaks about this in the Bible.  I believe my relationship with God is personal and he speaks to us in a personal way. some of us are the eyes  the ears  the mouth  the hands  that feet.  God speaks to me through my eyes  my mind and my heart. God may speak through others through their words  their actions or what they can make with their hands.
the manspread isn t about anatomy  its about dominance. pay attn to the men who sit that way and also note how many men do not.
so... where are the elf parts ! no elven sword... no elven leaf-armour... no elven detailing of any kind... so  is this the best you could do  amazon  !!!
if you fuzzed out the face and asked me to guess which cast member of the northman this was  I would probably go with eric skarsgaard before he got ripped for filming.  kind of true blood-era eric skarsgaard.  what I would not say is that this is galadriel  fuzzed face or no fuzzed face.  galadriel is not and never was a tomboy  she was a powerful  intelligent lady who knew who she was and was confident in that power.  that is not galadriel.  end of sentence.  you want galadriel  go watch some peter jackson Lord of the rings.
I saw that image and just peter dinklage barfing clip .
if someone doesnt want people to read the Bible to them  maybe it just means they dont want the Bible read to them. most of the time  it doesnt have anything to do with demons. they re probably not interested in religion in general
disney gave us jake skywalker. amazon s giving us georgedriel.  what s next  transgender blue faries whengeppetto wishes upon a star  ...oh  never mind
women can be a strong female character without acting like a man but they seem not to know that
a woman can be feminine and be strong. this just looks dumb. plus gladriel doesnt need armor and sword to be badass. she uses skill and intelligence and whoop ass spell knowledge.
bro be posing like she about to drop the next call of duty
everyone s pointing out the manspreading  the very unelven armor  but no one is pointing out the ridiculous length of the handle on thatsword - its far too long for gaint of a man much less a she-elf
in the new series galadriel rides a horse as if she were a man. I always thought that the correct way for such a feminine and strong elven woman to ride would be to wear a long dress and with both legs on one side of the horse  just like mexican charro women do when they perform very dangerous maneuvers on their horses https   www.youtube.com watch v y2hhgbla-sw
galadriel is obviously posed like that to sell wrangler jeans and g fuel to cowboys and motocross fans.
galadriel was a wise  powerful  feminine  dangerous  and respected leader in her own right. so let s make her a warrior man instead. because wahmen  patriarchy  toxic masculinity  or something like that.
why  why  why are they doing this to Lord of the rings
what makes galadriel powerful is her use of words  knowlegde and wisdom . not weapons of war
haha! in the middle of fangor forrest there s a disposal for all the aborted little keebler elves and dwareves.
shhhh. its a cosplay.
progress demands sacrifice.
money
lol read books
in response to adamthegameboy I would say this is a helpful verse when placed in those situations matthew 10 12-2212 and when ye come into a house  salute it 13 and if the house be worthy  let your peace come upon it  but if it be not worthy  let your peace return to you.14 and whosoever shall not receive you  nor hear your words  when ye depart out of that house or city  shake off the dust of your feet.15 verily I say unto you  itshall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.16  behold  I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.17 but beware of men  for they will deliver you up to the councils  and they will scourge you in their synagogues 18 and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake  for a testimony against them and the gentiles.19 but when they deliver you up  take no thought how or what ye shall speak  for itshall be given you in thatsame hour what ye shall speak.20 for it is not ye thatspeak  but the spirit of your father who speaketh in you.21 and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death  and the father the child  and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.22 and ye shall be hated by all men for my name s sake  but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. additionally if you feel guilt for what s said to you and examine yourself and make the changes where necessary if the spirit presses it upon you. but also know people will deflect and accuse you or have no intention of listening to what you and what the Lord has to say through you  then in those moments  dust off your feet  even Jesus who was perfect faced these sort of things by the pharisees being accused of doing the devils work and breaking mosaic law. so if you doing God s work and spreading his message your past sin is irrelevant as the gospel of Jesus Christ is that you are forgiven.  let he who is without sin cast the first stone  we are called to forgive one another.  for if you forgive other people when they sin against you  your heavenly father will also forgive you.
11 40 that guy doesnt know what he s talking about! lol
momma says praying to God makes the devil cry!ok she didn t say that but  keeping your focus on heavenly things takes you away from the worldly devil that can only try to trip you up. put bluntly  I think its silly to let your faith  falter in even the most minute way by thinking  a demon will hear my worries and hurt me with them . no. your prayer is your armor. you split your attention to God by trying to keep one eye on the devil while you pray. I think Imade a point. this feels rambly lol. rambly  thats a word.....
should call it woke of the rings.
the only reason God allowed satan to do all those things to job was because God knew job would never turn against him like satan thought he would.  thats why God not only gave job things back  he gave him more because he was very happy with job.  personally  I just try my hardest  and if I screw up  I ask God to forgive me.  that keeps me in relationship with God  which is the most important thing.
praying out loud can easily lead to  heaping up phrases  as gentiles do .I dont remember where  so I could totally be wrong  but I thought someone asked Jesus how they should pray. what about the pharasies and the sadducies    those who pray out loud or ostentatiously show how holy they are... they have already received their rewards. I can pray out loud when Im alone  but Im very self-conscious around others.
amen sister.
do you think that churches are not talking in depth enough about how someone is truly a Christian I find it really sad that most people dont know what means to be a true Christian in general with society but sadly even in lots of church. people think that going to church on sunday  read the Bible sometimes and  saying  Jesus is God son makes someone a Christian. when in actuality they could easily not be saved. being saved is believing that Jesus is the son of God and also having a spiritual connection with God. I know there a lot of  Christians  people who dont know the difference and its incredible scary and I some a lot of the blame is that church aren t diving into what it means to be true Christian at all. lots of church are teaching the Bible at the surface level and because of that people who think they are saved aren t at all  they are what I call scholars of the Bible. I hope this is discussed more within church so more people will come to the realization that they aren t truly save yet and turn to God to be his true child.  they saying being a child of God is a narrow road but its more narrow then what people think it is.
this thing should be renamed to   ring around the toilet .
hahahahaha! the milksops developing the show are ridiculous. why do they feel the need to nerf galadriel  I guess their pea-brains cant grasp how powerful she is according to the way professor tolkien wrote her. amazon spent all that money for sjw-level fan fiction!
manly fighters are far below the level of leadership and power that galadriel had. she was more powerful than some kings.she was a being that manly men gave their lives for.  such a disappointment.
Im not antI  but I lost faith after my brother s death.
idk I think God wants us as we are  our minds running at a million miles an hour is truly us  idk you do you.
I can smell the tuna from here
in the original trilogy by peter jackson galadriel was a mysterious and graceful powerful elf.  we knew she was powerful  but we didn t know how powerful  and that adds a lot to the character.  when frodo offered her the ring galadriel went off the rails a bit and said she could rule the world and thatshe would be feared  but then she composed herself and she said thatshe  passed the test .  the left cant understand that a woman performing her role  whether its as an elf queen witch thing  stay at home mom or whatever can be empowering.  they think women have to do exactly what men do even if the woman cant do it.
we dont share that anatomy.   whaaaat ! !  the pic is toooooooootally based off the books!!  galadriel was born a man and transitioned into a woman.  it is known!!  the show takes place when was much younger and she still had her dangly bits.  its the same for the dwarf woman.  she does not have a beard because the show takes place before the time when dwarf women collectively decided to become men through hormone injections!!  you can read about it in the appendices.  how about you all try reading tolkien s books instead of getting all your info from peter jackson s movies. lol
you know how ya fix this get the ultimate Lord of rings fan involved  stephencolbert  ---
tolkien modeled galadriel after the blessed virgin mary. amazon to ignore the catholicity from tolkien s work is folly! instead of being humble to tolkien  amazon think they can do better. arrogance and hubris! in sacred art  not post-modern pop culture art   when the blessed mother was depicted as  warrior  crushing the head of the snake  artists never portrayed her looking like st. joan of arc. and the sitting posture is a disgrace! what a disaster! from 320 to mrs ruth austin 25 january 1971 tolkien wrote    it is true that I owe much of this character  galadriel   to Christian and catholic teaching and imagination about mary .  the letter spoke of galadriel being a  penitent  for being a  leader  in the rebellion against the valar. she refused to accept forgiveness but eventually redeemed when she rejected evil.
how dare you manslpain a manspread.
satan wont give a dime for what he can get for a nickel. he doesnt need to turn Christians into athiests  or satanists   he s fine with turning a Christian into a timid   ineffectual believer.thanks for your great commentary.
that verse you mentioned was regarding praying out loud in front of others in a show-off way  not alone. thats not a comparable thing.
@melonie mac go boom  precisely  as I explained.
she still is mate  this is bad fan fic
I can0t stop laughing everytime  I read the part she scolds celeborn xd
I believe the covenant between God and his children is protected  demons cannot hear. they know only what you allow them to know.
galadriel wasn t meant to be galahad-riel...
just an fyI Im pretty sure young galadriel being a warrior is actually valid. thats not the part that bothers me. Im scared its going to be sexual and that they will 1000  ignore tolkien. but galadriel wearing armor is not the issue.
make men like women and women like men  is the unfortunate ideas they are pushing.
notmygaladriel
hey melonie did you see the destroy all humans 2 trailer it looks good and has a sexy russian agent that is not censored
this bandwagon hate of rings of power sure is giving dividends. we even have grils siding with us.
Imean a masc acting girl really doesnt bother me at all.. if that character was set to be like that. retconning characters and story is not it and it comes off forced and odd. then they get defensive when fans tell them they dont like it  lmfao a joke
forgot to add  that I dont really mind the man spread  Imean she looks badass buuuuuut  is it necessary   ummm no.  one just has to wonder.. why
thank you
you do know the films are pj not tolkien. she s of the line finwe. who opposed melkor. during a time of all out war against the elves who seen most of her family destroyed. you dont she ll pick up a sword
heroine in book by very conservative professor written seventy years ago--  I am no man heroine from  progressive  tv show in 2022--  deez nuts. which does right by women  take a wild guess!
rings of reeee
commenting to feed the algorithm
boom!! boom!! boom!!
wow.... just.... smh
not to worry it barely is Lord of the rings to begin with.
dont judge. maybe she s packin .
guys have nuts. thats why we sit that way. so stupid...
anunexpectedrewatch2022let s hit them where it hurts.  not watching a show hits much harder than a bad review.  let s show them that we wont accept a defiled version of middle earth.  on the 2nd of september let s flood the internet with pictures of the original trilogy or a picture of a tolkien book and drown out the shambles that amazon is trying to sell us.    anunexpectedrewatch2022
a long time ago  my father was playing with a oujia board as a young boy  and he asked it who he was going to marry and itspelled the name. he ended up marrying her many years later. make of that what you will.
but she doesnt wear armor. they ve already ignored tolkien in every aspect of this show.
she wasn t a warrior.
@adam  Imean tolkien did mention thatshe had the build of an amazon and even mentions her taking part in athletic feats. kinda sounds warriorish to me. enough to wear amazon can say this is where they got the inspiration. Im worried the show will be shit but she isn t the reason yet.
@aprille r  I do believe you will be correct. as soon as bezo s said he wanted a Lord of the rings like game of throne show I lost faith. just saying her wearing armor is at least possible with how tolkien described young galadriel. even with that I still think amazon will botch it.
@jolt mann  so they just make up their own shit ftom that
yeah  browsing through comments  it doesnt seem like anyone has ever read a word of tolkien  but just relies on peter jackson s depictions.  I guess they dont even know that pj made all kinds of changes to tolkien s work  including galadriel for whom pj invented brand new lines that tolkien didn t write.  tolkien wrote a great deal about galadriel over the decades and the character changed over time. but among the things we have in tolkien s own words are that  1  her mother named her  man-maiden   nerwen  in aman   2  thatshe was a match for the athletes of the eldar  as well as the loremasters    3  thatshe was an  amazon  who would tie up her hair.  and  most importantly here   4  she personally  fought fiercely  against her noldorin kin in defense of her telerin kin in the 1st kinslaying at alqualond . that gives the show s writers lots to work with  and the final work product should be judged on its merits  not on a few marketing snippets.
@patrick  very true. I will say the comments from the people making the show bother me compared to peter jackson s movie. that and jeff bezo s comment about making a Lord of the rings game of thrones style show. I am still very worried about the show but I will  give it an honest chance .kinda like halo. sadly I was bored of thatshow after 3 episode with that.
link me.
they should cut their loses and not say this has anything to do with Lord of the rings. just make it a generic fantasy movie.
I think she has a hidden  down there. is she supposed too be trans
forget the fact that this is a terrible look for galadriel. this is a terrible look for anyone! that costume is horrible!ps. melonie  youre looking more like lara croft every video!
I cannot say this enough.do not watch.  they will only care if they get no veiws
as a woman wtf is this  she would still look a hundred times cooler with her legs crossed just sayin.
bruh
I hate this so much.galadriel as a warrior  dwarf women without beard  hobbits in the second age  not going to watch this at all.
she s portrayed as a  toxic  man but her power really lies in her femininity. she looks nothing like galadriel. her hair isn t glowing  she s not feminine at all  no mysterious beauty  I feel no power when I look at her.. just a meh character from a mainstream modern series.
play Christian rock out loud.. demons  people or God doesnt want to be around that.
dudette  she is just seating  I would imagine is difficult to sit crosslegged with an armour on. she looks like a woman  in armour. still super feminine.
I get that mostly man do a  manspread  but I seen enuf guys sit with there leggs over one another to know that a manspread or a woman legg over legg is not limited to the sexes I seen some woman do a manspread and I seen some men do the woman legg thing if we are for equality of men and woman then why are we not allowing men or woman to set however they want this conversation seems rather detremental to equality of choice.am not a fan of men doing the leg over leg itseems rather painfull to the balls but he if some men want to do that let them and of some woman like the spread the leggs let them why are you bashing there choice of how they want to sit  I get that the series as I understood it from people is making galadriel look bad and maybe its fair but dont bash how people choose to sit maybe youre channel can do some possative stuf rather then always bashing things and maybe how men and woman sit had been diffirent in the past  maybe in the past woman  have sat more like men we dont know that I dont think there is annything wrong with how she sits on that cover realy sounds like youre just looking for stuf to bash realy.there is a fine line between fair critisism and just picking targets to get content out Imean are people realy making video s in 2022 talking trash about how people choose to sit
amazon s lotr already pissed everyone off a fucking cliff this show will be shit and disrespectful to the lore and will be getting roasted for it
amazon s lotr is an abomination! I refuse to accept it is part of the legendarium or canon! it doesnt exist. its nothing more than a high school drama play put together by students! but even most high school drama plays are better than this!
Im a sexist  a fascist  racist blah blah blah blah. oh well!
why would I wanna watch a wannabe strider
haha yall think demons are real. lmao
subed
remember when women were feminine  its nice mel at least does  seems amazon forgot.

I ll be honest with you. I stoped watching your video when you said that you are not so familiar with the books and you know more from the movies. which is very very good  everyone should start from something and I am encouraging you to read the books  far more beautiful than the movies. but its not good when youre taking the  movie lore  to prove that another  tv lore  is wrong. not saying that you are false  or trying to ride the wave of   attacking amazon   in order to get some views. I see you are in good intentions. but for me  you are not reliable source. and I say it with the best way possible  trying to be as honest and polite I can be in the same time. have a nice time and be well.
nice capcom reference!  fun game!
@ford prefect     it was awesome on the genesis.  I also liked him in the marvel vs. capcom series.
yeah  when was that  the 50s
more woke trash.  I will not be watching.  ever!
as the left have been leftsplaining to me lately  the only people that doesnt totally love everything about new kick ass galadriel are sexiest  misogynist  cuck  toxic  gate keepers
you lost me halfway through the video. why are you preaching religion on a lotr video
you look ridiculous   galadriel is great.
femininity is a gift. it is beautiful  masterful  unique.  why not embrace these gifts instead of trading those traits for male attributes
an excellent question
