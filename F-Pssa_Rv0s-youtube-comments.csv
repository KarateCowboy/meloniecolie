hollywood needs more people like andrew garfield and sir ian mckellen speaking out.
I agree 100 . isn t that one of the benefits of acting sjws keep wanting representation  but dont want prominent straight actors to play lgbt roles and characters and its ridiculous. people forgot that jared leto played a transwoman and got an academy award for it. other stars should be able to explore these roles.
its the way  acting   used to be before hollywood lost its spine and went woke.
its very simple  if youre straight you can only play straight. if you gay  or anything other than straight   you can do whatever you want. if youre white  you can only play white. if youre not white  you can do whatever you want. if youre a man  you can only play a man. if youre not  you can do whatever you want. these are the current rules for casting in hollywood. they re probably not written down anywhere  but we all know it. you can have all the nuanced conversations you like  but ultimately if the above rules are violated there will be backlash.
respect  10 for andrew then..
empathetic imagination   wow.  I like this.  he is saying that actors become their characters empathetically.  they re acting becomes the character.  hopefully this is too complex for the wokies to understand.
I agree that a good actor or actress can and should be able to play any role   with one exception  when its unbelievable and it takes you out of the story. for  example  when a person of one race is playing a character of another race. you  can get away with this in animations and on the stage  where things are already  more abstract because of the sets  but in film or tv it doesnt work.
acting is the most minor of gifts and not a very high-class way to make a living. after all  shirley temple could do it at the age of 4  acting is the perfect idiot s profession  acting is a nice  childish profession  pretending youre someone else while at the same time selling yourself       -katherine hepburn
they do the same thing in american animation  they dont let white people voice black characters anymore  also I first found you on chrissie mayr s stream and it was a surprise when I came to your channel to find out your a Christian  its great to see more outspoken Christians in our community God bless
love the verse of the day.  I like how when people speak out they cant just say yes or no.
I completely agree and I ll even go one step further.  not only should people be  allowed  to portray those of differing sexual orientations  but also different genders  different races  different privileges  different political leanings  different everything.  nothing is inherently wrong or  disrespectful   it depends entirely on how its done.  one of the most glaring examples of this is blackface.  it can absolutely be used to disparage and mock  but thats far from its only use.  two of my favourite episodes in two of my favourite shows  always sunny and community  both had blackface episodes  and both only mocked the person in the blackface and its perception by others.  in fact  most would argue that both were tacitly against blackface and its use  it just used blackface to show that perspective  and I think it was extremely hilarious and poignant.  one also cant help but point out how outraged everyone is over any hint of white actors playing non-white roles  but how celebrated and encouraged it is for black actors to play non-black  specifically white  roles.  when all of this is taken into account  it becomes quite clear its not about morals and ethics  its about replacing whites.  I say this as a minority who is neither white nor black.  we re stuck arguing about rules that they ve never once played by.
I always thought a cool thing about acting was the challenge the actor was put to to act well and learn the person from their role to do that  and since you do that either way  why reduce the pool of qualified talent for roles when unneeded
this reminds me of the argument the woketivists posited years ago  concerning voice acting and them being offended at black animated characters being played by white vas  and vice versa. the best  most ironic form of racism that continues to be perpetuated by these people--trying to make everyone stay in their labeled box. samuraI jack was a japanese character voiced by a black va and the voice was perfect  would there be a problem now
who is is more appalled thatsir ian mckellen isn t an actual wizard
andrew garfield is everything. I said it.
I have never tried that gfuel stuff before  but I did place an order to let them know who should win. I got two shaker cups with random assortment of flavors  and the only one that didn t make me want to hurl was something like gummy worms  or gummy fish  I cant remember  it was red. I have never heard of any of these people  except pewdiepie  and his flavor was...ok. maybe I should try the hydration stuff  Im such a boomer.anyway  if anyone has some suggestions on flavors that wont make my teeth hurt  I d appreciate it. and mel  when you win  I will have no choice but to buy a third shaker cup.
love you mel! gotta thank you for introducing me to neffex from your outro  Ive been listening to him all week and loving it! not even sure if youreally listen to him  but thanks for having 1 of his songs at the end of your vids! love your content  youre awesome! thank you for all your hard work  and game on!!
its funny how they attack straight actors who refuse to kiss dudes in movies but at the same time have a problem with straight guys willingly playing gay roles in movies.
he s not wrong. also he said he likes to play roles with characters who have a different world view than him.
its acting. unless its an actual historical figure there should be an attempt to find someone who personally fits the role. otherwise itshouldnt matter.
for sure
absolutely
and youtube needs more people like melonie mac!
they going to black list them both.
not just a benefit  but one would normally conclude the entire point of acting is to convince the viewer one is someone different than oneself.
this reminds me of al pacino. he did a scene once on a trackfield with a method actor  cant remember who  though . before the scene started  the method actor ran a few laps. pacino asked him why he did that and the guy said  so I look tired in the scene . pacino replied  Im an actor  I just act tired .
community removing that episode was so dumb.  that ep was great.  and he was dressed up as an elf not just a black person
@daniel n  and it was such a throwaway joke in the episode as a whole  too.  like 2  of it was chang the night elf and shirley calling it a hate crime.  the rest of it was an amazing story about suicide and struggle and how the very act of overcoming obstacles is what makes us stronger.  sadly almost everything new I see has enough  wokeness  to pull me out of it and ruin any sense of fantasy and enjoyment Imight have had.  Ive more or less resigned myself to watching my old favourites  and thanking my younger self for downloading and storing every episode of every show I loved.
@electricutie  ye I had to get my brother and his gf another copy cos they were watching community for the first time. and yea it was a good ep with the whoke fat neil a d guilt thing
exactly. and there is more than one case where a black man voiced non black characters. phil lamar voiced a number of characters in his career  including vamp from the mgs series. kratos from the gow series was played by two black men  one tc carson  the other Christopher judge. and shredder from the late 80s early 90s turtles cartoon series was voiced by james avery  aka. uncle phil from fresh prince of bel air.unlike in live action where physical appearance does matter depending on the context of the movie or show  voice acting is just your voice. no one cantell the color of your skin or who you choose to sleep with through your voice. if we even have to  stay in our lane  for voice acting  just about everyone would not have a job dubbing anime.  p
black is higher on the privilege stack than japanese  so no.they already answered that.
like with someone who s trans the ones who have had surgery unless they have a nude scene reflecting that I dont think itshould matter.
neil patrick harris as barney in himym and voiced dickgrayson nightwing. two of the most straight characters ever. enough said.
I strive to be wise as ian. he s my role model!
if gay people can play straight roles why cant straight people play gay roles  I think this is why a lot of artists and actors have been  coming out  as bi.
I love ian mckellan. glad he is stating the obvious  that acting is literally pretending to be something that you are not.
Imean I agree with the whole acting part buuuut when it comes to playing certain scenes that go over the actors bound like stuff that go against their orientation  I feel like there s a point it could go so far when it comes to playing a different role that is against the person s orientation  so I kinda agree but at the same time I disagree with it
I need to go see jujitsu kaiser s movie trying to wait untill it comes out on funimation in dub. also I love your family  haven t been following your channel for very long but the videos I have seen shows how close you all are.
its great to see g fuel creating a contest where people have to accomplish something and then their work is judged on creativity!  not wokeness!  they re keeping politics out of it  bravo.
what we need is more film studio that are made away from hollywood. one of the best street fighter film I seen was made by indie called street fighter assassin s fist. one of the best fan film I seen. better than hollywood can ever made. seeing a live action goutetsu vs goukI  akuma  was an awesome live action battle. witnessing how goukI finally breaks his limit turning to a demon called akuma. melonie I dont know if you ever seen thatseries on youtube. but you should check it out. it respect the street fighter lore better than hollywood.
love you melonie! can you make the text of the Bible verses larger onscreen   I like to read and think about them before getting your view.    thank you for being wholesome and awesome!
exactly. wokeness has all but killed western entertainment industry at this point  though...
hopefully you win
does that mean robin williams shouldn t have been cast as a lead in the birdcage  I despise the fact that disney is making the dwarves cgI in their remake of snow white  to keep from offending dwarves. the next thing you know  hollyweird will  reimagine  female dwarves in a tolkien story as clean shaven. oh. wait. -boom
my favorite actor.
actors are paid to act. they re pretending to be something they re not. so  the sexual orientation of the actor shouldn t matter. the only thing thatshould matter is if the actor can pretend well enough to be in that role. if we pushed limitations on who can act what type of character then we probably wouldn t have movies like broke back mountain  texas players club or to wong foo  thanks for everything! julie newmar.
Ive gotten multiple warnings for fb posts from years ago. they ve added up and I cant monitize or go live for like years now. if they demanded I take the post down I wouldn t even know how to find it years ago on my time line. its so weird.
I would suggest taking the jussie smollett courtroom walk out to the prison. photoshop yourself over it and when he raises his your hand in the black power sign have your new shaker cup with the gfuel logo predominantly in your hand.
love that top! great content once again.
I believe neil patrick harris talked about this as well.
why growing up in the 90s were the best  funny skits like men on films with two straight men playing gay guys was funny af. patrick swayze in to wong foo with wesley snipes and john leguizamo acting as drag queens was good...plus patrick looked amazing same with john. actors back then studied what they were playing and the reasons why I love angelina jolie  that woman studies and do her own stuff.
by this logic neil patrick harris shouldn t have played barney on how Imet your mother.
they dont even have to use the bI one they can just use the gender fluid card and say they are not opposed to dating a guy if its a guy actor or girl if its a girl actor.
Ive never seen a gay man play a straight role. sorry try again
if birdcage was made today and robin williams was alive he would get cancelled for playing a gay role
@kingslayer  exactly.
I was born in 1984  the 90s were the best.
good luck with the g-fuel.  I remember the gamestop incident since the quartering covered it and thats how a came here.
totally random and unrelated to the video  but have you ever considered purchasing firearms  I was building an ar recently and for some reason I feel like thatsomething you would enjoy. plus  if you ever got into firearms their are quite a bit of sponsorships available. reliable sponsors too  as they can only really advertise with people who tend to be targets of the woke mob. with talks of war and such  perhaps some firearm education is needed in the general community and you can share your journey with your fans.just something that came to mind while I watched your videos. enjoy things right now since a smaller channel can experiment more freely. oh  and congrats with the top 4 placement with g-fuel!
I  mean gay for pay has been a thing for...decades now lol
commenting for more than feeding the algorithm.   this time  100  agree with andrew garfield!
do you think we should get Godzilla vs pacific rim
you like drawing  youre a legit gamer  and a Christian   its like youre a shorter  brown-haired  brown-eyed  female version of me  almost.  next thing you ll tell me is that you find tall  blonde-haired blue-eyed guys attractive and have some patience with a physique and financial state that may be an early work-in-progress.  Im reaching for a girl thats way out of my league  aren t i
in euphoria zaydana plays a junkie....why couldn t we get a real junkie
I remember he said he wanted mj to be a gay guy back when he was spider-man.if he wants to be openly gay  just....do it lol.
uh oh  she read  twatter  out loud. wrong pronunciation but still. looool.I really really want you to win the g-fuel competition though  considering what you do on this channel. its important to me.
no need to explain youre a busy gal go have fun!
if we keep dividing people based on differences... segregation will never end. actors are acting. thats the point. ... talented people can do whatever they suit..and opportunity ought to be fair for them all.
only wizards can play wizards. if you cant shoot spells therefore you cant act as a wizard
twitter needs to disappear already
on the sucject of actors playing outside of their race sexuality other  does anyone remember the time robert downey jr played a white guy who played a black guy and did a great job  I feel like thats a thing that gets forgotten  p
hey melonie I just want to say that I am so proud and happy for andrew garfield for speaking up and other hollywood speaking up too. anyway i think that hollywood stars should have a right to play gay parts in movie  ok melonie. anyway it is their job to play the gay part of the movie for acting job  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say that bout this topic  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great safe trip to see your family and have a great evening and a good night too  ok melonie.
when people talk about this topic  all I hear them say is  the gays play the gays  and  the blacks play the blacks  and it just makes me think we are an inch away from separate water fountains. and I wonder what exactly it is that progressives want us to progress towards.
its like united artists are thinking about casting james bond as a woman however ian fleming the creator of the books never had bond as a woman so why does the film studio get the right to decide that ian fleming is suddenly wrong that he should have a woman as 007 and considering most of the audiences that go to bond movies are males.the film studio has been worn by critics that it could even kill the bond franchise. good old pc4pc sake it could be the first time a bond movie really bombs at the box office just like the ghostbusters movie that bombed at the box office and the patriarchy was blamed for it even though I didn t care if it was an all female cast it was just poorly acted and it made everyone look stupid in the movie it was more bad directing and acting that killed that movie than anything else. adrian movies are just purely entertainment and should never be made a commentary on society.
great anime melonie s1 is epic
if an actor auditioned for the role and they re the best of the best for that character than they should get the role! itshouldn t matter if its a straight person playing a gay  or lgbt   person or a gay person playing a straight person. its acting! people cry for  inclusivity  and that a gay person should only play a gay person  but answer me this... are their acting skills as good or on par with the straight actor who went out for the role  the strongest actor should get the role so the movie has the best chance of being good! same with the race of an actor. if a black actor tries out for a white role and is the best of the best  sign them to the dang role!
make sure to put boomer on one side of the cup!!!!

@                         not sure what you mean by that emojI series  but okay
I still need to rewatch tropic thunder. I watched that movie a few times as a kid and have very fond memories of it  but in recent years...Ive heard some stuff  and I cant fukin wait
@psyphonyx audio  I just remember the jelly bean jokes  the guy who was forced to do a play or something and the  I will fuck you up  line
@t00nyboy  ...acting.. exactly
@psyphonyx audio  also  Imust outline the hilarity that I have this exchange with you after I recently sorted out some catastrophic audio problems
I agree with you for the most part but  I think a black person playing a pre-established black character or original character is the best fit. I dont like the idea of race swapping pre-existing characters like a black clark kent  superman  or a race swapped blade from the blade movies comics. I dont want a black geralt of rivia  the witcher   black ragnar lothbrok  viking  just as much as I dont want a white t challa  black panther    white storm  marvel x-men .the race topic in hollywood is a whole nother realm because a lot of the best characters should be represented like the source material they come from.  games books comicbooks
@stealthkillz311  true! I didn t think of pre established characters while writing my comment. I agree with you! I was think more along the lines of brand new characters that we haven t seen.
garfield says its partly about equality of opportunity  but I dont think thats true  at least I have never heard anyone make an argument from thatstandpoint. and I dont think that would be a valid concern to have. does anyone care if gay actors play straight characters
with how gay the entertainment industry is  I dont quite buy it. garfield might be bicurious. there was this story involving producers or directors of true blood trying to breech a Christian man s contract by turning his character gay and forcing him to get in bed with men. also the industry seems to like to traumatize its key players like the chick from the original blade runner or the kid from the exorcist. hollywood hating straight white guys I d think they d be all about giving garfield what he wants in the worst most degenerate way imaginable.
zero downvotes  too.  thats weird.  apparently you dont have as many haters as you should.
as part of the lgbt community  I really dont see a issue with straight people playing a gay character  as long they play it respectfully
I cant believe youre 35  I literally would guess you were 20. you still have to show I d
God bless john trent from bounding. also  how about this  a black dude shouldn t play a viking  unless its the football team of course  and a white dude shouldn t play a zulu. as long as the actor looks like the character then thats cool. make believe away.
people need to really really read the Bible. I hate when they mention this just hold hand and accept everything bs  I am speaking specifically from scripture  so please if you have an issue  take it up with the Bible. yahuah does not mention accept everything  he has specific things that he will not forgive if you do not repent for and this topic is one of them. you cannot rewrite it  you cannot interpret it with common day ideals. the book is the book  itsays what itsays  follow it or dont. I blame the churches as they are just cult tools to control people using the word of the Lord. they will read you matthew in one place  mark in another  luke at your church and john and the next... they all have their own interpretations of any one story. so there s just one deceptive thing they do there  you know the one thing they do not encourage enough  telling you to read the Bible yourself. this is not a faith for the weak and trust me even the most strict person still sins  but its on you to realize it is a sin and repent. trying to fit common day ideals into your faith will be the quickest ticket to that fire pit.   you can now try to attack me as if I am the one who wrote the book  or!!! read it !!. nice video melonie
I disagree entirely. I feel like when ppl are playing a role  as in make believe that they should identify as close to the person that is being portrayed as possible. Imean this is no fake shit..this is acting...wait just a minute
Im glad you are hanging out with brittany. tell her paganism and astrology are whack.
I saw your asmr video! you completely lost it  I thought you had been zombified!!
can people with living parents play orphans   who is qualified to play an alien  from another planet    do you need a background is espionage to play a spy   what about gay actors taking straight roles good Lord  finding a decent actor in the first place is hard enough.  now you need to find a left handed trans pagan orphan bi-racial at least 5 9  tall   oh  and they need to be able to sing  too.
I clicked on this vid to drop a comment about your saint patrick day vid  the one with the pinch me shirt  and that video got me subbing and I clicked the bell. comments arent allowed on that vid  for some reason  so here I am!!
I personally dont care who people have sex with  what people identify as   the color of ones skin  just hire the best person for the role. if the best actress for jean grey is zendaya then I d be down for it. if the best actor for tony stark recast is chiwetel ejiofor then I d still be down for it.....
Imean  michael c. hall played a gay character in six feet under  and Im pretty sure he s straight  right  I didn t see anything bad about that. but then  that was in the 2000 s.
I was actually wondering at the amount of people who passed judgement on you how many of them are in a religion I thought God can only pass judgement and isn t that a breach of one of the ten commandments esp if they are Christian. or some of these people does weekend Christians.
day 19 prt 2 of commenting on your video until g-fuel sponsors me.its called acting. idk why this is hard all of a sudden
any actor should be able to play any role. otherwise  whats the point of  acting
well someone lowkey came out lol. bruh maybe Im old school. no straight male is going to complain to do a gay role  that boy sweet  but no hate do you brother.
dont tell the wokies about the gay porn industry  they will flip.
for real  I have zero issue with gay people playing straight parts  so itshouldn t be an issue when the roles are reversed.
assuming I understand you correctly  I would say that its both  because it comes down to the talent of the role. good straight actors should have no obstruction to gay roles  and vice versa  but let s say I was advertising for a role and I got 50  applications. when making a list of say  5 auditions  I would likely be interested in the actors who say they re gay on the form or whatever  because you would expect that they fit the character better  but this isn t always the case  so you dont want to establish it as a rule  more like a personal guideline so to speak
cant see anyone wanting to
hmmm garfield looking seriously sus...
they re not playig!
Im gay and full  1000  support straight actors playing gay roles. otherwise 1  you wouldnt be able to allow gay actors to play straight roles  and 2  the gay men at least attracted to the acting profession seem to be all cut from the same cloth  and very effeminate so if we didn t let straight actors play gay we d literally never see a masculine gay character again  and 3  if yourestrict the talent pool  then by sheer statistics you ll most often have less talented actors playing gay roles. activists  do not speak for us all!!!!
but we already have straight playing gay  and gay playing straight.no one cantell me neal patrick harris is gay  not even his husband.
who gives a  as long as the portrayal and story are convincing and not revised garbage on repeat.at least a few of em  know its just pretend.I care more about living up to the actual source material than who s in someone s bed or anything not having to do with the role played  respect to those who keep fiction seperate from reality.
boom boom boom
your killing it with subs  Im trying for 2k
the whole idea of acting is to be acting. this nonsense has to stop.
cool
I normally simply comment  comment for the algorithm.  but that is when I dont really have anything to say but I still wanna help a youtuber with the algorithm  I do like this channel though so I dont just wanna do my normal thing but I cant think of anything to say so in lieu of a comment this comment will be my comment.
only superheroes with super powers should play super heroes.......wait what  doesnt really work for a lot of things in movies. better yet  let s make a concentration camp survivor play a hostage in a concentration camp for a movie. they can relive their trauma  it will be great......its called acting for a reason.
thats not even supposed to be an issue. they are actors  aren t they  what are actors supposed to do  play roles in which they are characters they aren t in real life. this bs is so tiresome.
29.5k as of 20 30 est.
regarding monetisation speak to gary from nerdrotic
aren t people that are trying to gatekeep gay roles essentially saying that gay people cant act  thats quite the take if you ask me.
Im a gay man and I believe straight actors can play gay roles. watch skam france season 3 and tell me straight guys cant play gay roles after watching it.
andrew is gay playing straight. quuuueeeeen!
do you know of aoa1
this is probably me just looking into things to much but I notice when its a gay actor playing a gay role or a gay director for a movie they play the characters stereotypical. vs when its a straight actor or a non lgbtq director the characters are just like anyone else.
its acting so... act. bob bergan would agree and he is gay.
Im lgbt and this identity politics are out of hand lol.. who cares
they are probably fine with gays playing straight roles though. that makes their argument flawed.
remember when there was a gay cowboy movie played by 2 straight white men   that couldn t be made today.  think about that for a sec.
only gay people should play gay roles.only old people should play old people roles.only nordic people should play norse mythology roles.only spaceship fighter pilots should play spaceship fighter roles.only dead people should play ghost roles.or  you know  actors could act and portray completely different characters. its what they re good at. they ve only been doing it for thousands of years.
so in real life  a man can literally be a woman. but in la la land  a straight man cant even pretend to be a gay dude. got it.
sounds like he s a lil ... bI curiooous
hello
only gay actors playing gay roles is so dumb. lots of gay people play straight actors. that means gay actors should only play gay which would mean they wouldn t get much gigs
yuck!  why would they even want those roles.  why would they want to spread thatsocial cancer
hollyweird needs to stop being woke
sus...never take the mark of the antiChrist beast!
first!!!
