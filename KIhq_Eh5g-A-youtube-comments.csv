you nailed it  there was never any franchise fatigue  it is  the message  fatigue. I was chomping at the bit for the next marvel movie and each one of phase bore was just worse and preachier  shoving woke-ness down our throats. my goodwill is exhausted  disney is more concerned with grooming children and pushing political ideologies than they are about entertainment!
franchise fatigue  is just another term corporate media use to say  its not our fault people aren t watching our stuff
the same can be said for star wars as well. back during the prequel days we got a star wars movie every three years now we get a new star wars show every three months.
I agree  there s no such thing as  franchise fatigue  if you continue to put out good stuff you ll never get tired of it. and me and my father both agree that the mcu spider-man peter parker relied too much on ironman  s intelligence when peter parker is smart in his own right. the irony of even saying that is spider-man s the flagship character from marvel comics whereas iron man up until 2008 was a b-list superhero at best. course correct disney thats all I got to say.
Im not gonna hold my breath. marvel and disney have a lot of work to do to earn back any good will at this point.
nope. as a die hard fan of the mcu from 2008-2009 who religiously followed all things marvel  I can safely say they spent every bit of my good will in phase bore in favour of the agenda. even if they begin honouring the source material  legacy characters and true fans it will take a long time before I sit myself back in the cinema to reward disney mcu with my hard earned money  if ever.
speaking of the 90s spider-man cartoon  the raimI films drew a lot of inspiration from the show  especially with regards to certain character arcs and storylines. the 90s spider-man and x-men series was hugely influential and played a key role in introducing several of the most iconic marvel characters to a new generation.
dig the mention of the spider-man animated series .my niece and I were talking about how cartoons used to have a completely different feel to them thatstill holds up today. Ive now gotten her into spider-man  gargoyles  batman the animated series  and 90 s x-men and she loves them all. she s also gotten into classic thundercats  gI joe  and the flintstones  what can I say the girl has good taste lol.
thanks! melonie youre bringing some terrific energy on a dreary monday.   the spider-man 90 s cartoon is next level awesomeness.    most people like tom holland but hate iron spider-boy Im with you on that point.
a new video from melonie is a great way to start the week! her beautiful smile always brightens my day.
quality over quantity of money losing movies  they may be on to something. love this content and the creator s charisma. thanks for the info and entertainment ms. boom!
yeah I completely agree. the m-she-u spiderman up until the new one wasn t great. you do a good job pronounsing some of these difficult names. .  Im just getting tired of all this bullcrap. great video melonie. you look really good. take care.
you are spot on. the secret wars was one of my favorite storylines  but with everything so far  it isn t looking good. interested in hearing your thoughts on transformers rise of the beast wars. returning to the background.
I just can never get my hopes up when I know disney is involved. Im afraid that now that they re woke  they will always be woke. the only way the mcu will ever be great again is if its taken over by someone who actually likes the material. until then I think fans just have to continue to be disappointed  sadly. keep up the great content! always love watching your videos!
having people like melonie mac  and gary  and the drinker  and the literature devil and nina infinity   etc. creating content makes me feel better about the universe.
more melonie pronouncing names.  my absolute favorite.
back in the early and mid 2000 s people were so hyped for x-men  spider man  fantastic 4 and the hulk movies ever since we ve watched the 90 s animated series.
I just dont trust them anymore. even if they make changes  how long does that last  probably just be a bait and switch anyway.
yes!!! new!!!! video!!!!! great to so you melonie
the  dream sequence  do-over schtick goes all the way back to the early 80s with the old  dallas  show.  Im going on memory here so everyone be kind.  the guy who played bobby ewing  patrick duffy  wanted off the show and they killed him off.  he changed his mind when he realized it was a mistake and wanted back on.how they did it was his wife gf whoever went in the bathroom at the end of an episode wondering who was in the shower.  wouldn t you guess  good old bobby was back.  it was explained as his entire death being a  dream .   thats my memory of the dream sequence.  a  false death  plot device with a twist of flashback.......maybe.its been the butt of jokes here and there in hollywood and tv since.  and one of the greatest cop-outs for poor writing or contract disputes.  I just never thought the evil mouse would actually stoop that low.  that or use the  different universe  angle like a cheap alibi.
I was never fatigued with any marvel movie  I love them  I even rewatch some of them basicly every year  more than once sometimes  and I would love more of them  but all this woke shit makes me dont want to see any movie  before I know if it has any of that bs  so yea  youre 100  right.
Ive been reading comics for 30 years  I think. I dont feel any fatigue. I watched a lot of movies and series  almost all the mcu  except the eternals  and the only fatigue is exactly that   the force-fed preaching... I dont mind a little but its too much  badly executed and redundant  because its not only marvel but every new revisited ip . you can now predict some scenes or  character  arcs based on that and it takes so much space that the writing lacks substance for the rest  and I dont even demand masterpieces for every script.plus  Im respectful and Im not the target. I dont need to be  educated  and I dont think its an efficient way.
some of those early marvel movies were bangers. it got lame. most things do...
sayit louder for the execs in the back.
dude exactly  thus why people have kept coming back for what  like 15 years now  they started leaving when they realized the story had no overall direction or even consistency between films  and that all marvel was concerned with doing was pushing division politics. cus thats what this gender and race ideology ends up being. people fighting with each other. when we should be trying to head into an era where we re all truly just seen and seeing each other as just humans. thats how we get over racism  when we stop treating each other like we re fucking different because of skin color  and realize we re all in the same fucking boat.
exactly. its unusual how fatigues sets in right when quality walks out  that makes me too mad when people cant diagnose or they overcomplicate why a film fails or a franchise begins to struggle or sink. its almost always write out the gate  bad dialogue  jokes that dont land  spotty cg and poorly thought out character direction. far from home was just 9.9 10 man. endgame as well. infinity war as well. everything else has been a didappointment even if they were pretty good. love and thunder and multiverse were fine and maybe even a good movie. but waaaay underperformed quality wise compared to the potential. I dont think they were bad  but a one and done. I should ve wanted to watch both of them 5 times though
you said it better than anything I could add  here  I think. thats 100  true. the woke message is all thatseems to matter in the new mcu movies  and Ive had plenty of woke troll types get all disingenuous with me about  whatever are you talking about  what message do you mean   in an effort at starting fights with me to prove me right.  I just ignore them  I refuse to give disney my money until they shape up and can it with this woke garbage and go back to making fun movies for all to enjoy that actually stay true to canon.
thank bob capek. oh wait.... he was just shyt canned. back to the glory days we come!
people are tired of repetitive and predictable things that all.
@gloria thomas  thats true there s not much elasticity with superhero movies  its the same formula over and over  superhero  villain  save the world  rinse and repeat.
@zernohd  I see what you mean  there. its possible to challenge stereotypes without being preachy and overwrought  but the woke left and marvel disney dont seem to grok that notion. its got to be all in your face all the time for them  and then over the top from there  and thats what people in general cant stand. which is understandable. I still refuse to give them my money because of that.
and they aren t good  I loved rouge one and is probably my favorite star wars film. not the  best . just my favorite. I loved that droid man. that humor kist did it for me and I like the grit. didn t like andor  I hated obI won and that was so anticipated for me. what a historic ball drop
exactly. I didn t even bother seeing the last movie as I really had no interest in what happens to any of the characters.
tobey maguires spider-man is the true spider-man
really it wont be that hard cause marvel is dominating cinema
thats a lie  if marvel starts dropping awesome movies again and ppl get excited again you will totally jump on the hype train. like you said you were a die hard fan  so if marvel starts putting out good movies you ll change your tone. and thats ok  I will too. it will just take more then one movie to rebuild trust.
@cory82  we shall see  . that is if they completely shift back to sane   entertaining content . I doubt it
its not just about honouring the source material  mcu and dcu oversaturated the entertainment market with superhero movies series  superhero movies can only go so far  its the same formula over and over again.
@cory82  wrong. they ve ruined my favourite character in thor and disgraced themselves with awful movie after awful movie. you cannot make a judgement call that I will ever reward them with my money again. even if I do get back into the mcu  Im very much someone who will happily stream it free online to not reward the mcu after their deliberate agenda push and throwing their own ip down the drain in favour of the woke over the fans.
@j 1283  thats fine  but the fact that your streaming it and still going to watch itstill makes you a fan!! just because your not going to the theatres doesnt mean you wont watch and enjoy the film. thats my point  if you truly hated marvel you would watch it at all. you still care enough to streaming and watch it  why  cuz of the high demand for entertainment. thank you for proving my point.
@john thomas  thank you for stating the obvious  with arguments like that  you could have been a lawyer.
@cory82  ah  I see. yes  thats right  I would happily return to enjoying the movies  I wont deny myself entertainment. yes  if I truly hated marvel  I wouldn t care enough to comment  but its the fact I used to  and still love the old movies  love it until they chucked good storytelling and characterisation out of the window. cheers.
@unknown slayer  I hope so  I think they will....eventually. when push comes to shove all studios will drop woke nonsense and go back to trying to make money. I think no studio wanted to be the first one  now the warner bros dc has switched gears  the rest will follow. we wont notice a difference for a couple more years  cuz thats how long it take to make a movie.
@j 1283  exactly  if your still upset that they are making garbage  then you care! thats ok  I care. Imiss good storytelling  but Im not going to hold a grudge and boycott them if they start producing good stuff!!! marvel disney start making awesome movies but no one goes to watch it and it totally bombs in the box office what s the motivation to continue to make awesome movies  how many years have you complained about wanting good movies and if they start making good movies youre not going to support it
@cory82  they need to start making awesome movies first to even give the fans a chance to decide whether or not to watch it. right now with the trash they re bringing out  there s no option but to skip it and let the financial decline  e.g. thor 3 to 4  speak for you.
@cory82  you are kidding yourself if you think disney marvel will stop catering to the woke agenda.
@j 1283  I absolutely agree. one awesome movie wont make a difference. three awesome movies in a row will have lots of people talking and people to start getting optimistic about the future  five awesome movies and all the fans are back and phase 4 will be a warning to all studios to stay away from identity politics in the woke propaganda. warner brothers and dc have jumped off the woke band wagon  once they start making money again disney will follow. phase 5 is the perfect excuse to end the identity politics and woke propaganda. I really hope I really miss good awesome disney movies  awesome superhero movies  and good star wars movies. and if youre uncertain about the movies quality dint go opening weekend  let the youtube reviewers go opening weekend and they will let you know if the movies worth spending money  that way there you dont waste your money on the shitty movie and disney will make on good movies so they keep making it. just dont give up hope  disney will change because they are losing so much money the shareholders are pissed. kathleen kennedy is out once indiana jones 5 comes out  which gives hope for star wars  that alone tells me disney is starting to make big changes. the best thing about woke hollywood  Ive discovered so many amazing british shows. they are not as popular but thousand times better. I recommend  the capture  and  line of duty  amazing cop shows. check them out  their on prime if you have it.
I feel the same way. the lost me as a fan. Im no longer interested in mcu.
@cory82  yeah  absolutely  I was thinking about it and I d definitely consider paying the price of admission for one reason only  to endorse content that was antI absent of woke. if the mcu returned to form  I d look to help contribute simply so that they got the message  keep the agenda out and we ll give you our money. yes  I ll have a look thanks mate  british tv  when it gets it right  is some of the best content out there.

nah  thatshow was way too kid friendly.  all those net missiles  laser guns in place of bullet-shooting guns  morbius  hunger for  plasma  and sucking it through his hand  no punches... it was ridiculous.  the x-men and batman cartoons were way better.
none of these movies lost money
pronouncing
you look really good
@elden wolf Lord  actually I remember something like this happen nerds getting jumped by a bunch of jocks at school but I was 10 at the time but I never gotten jumped  lucky me.
@ninten70  I was a jock but had to keep to myself the fact I loved stuff like Lord of the rings. star wars. blades. or the tobey maguire spidey trilogy. it wasnt until a bit after iron man came out that itstarted to become something that cool kids watched.
in 2015-2019 marvel did its best work  an animated guardians of the galaxy series in three seasons  79 episodes. I recommend it  its funny. its good entertainment  like itshould be. after that the galaxy has seen a dearth of good marvel works.
never get too comfortable with success and become complicit. no matter how high up you get  you can always fall back down. seems marvel might be realizing this.
90 s era marvel comics in general  had the best storylines. fall of the mutants was one of the best story arcs in x-men  not to mention all the crossovers. all this source material  is amazing! why not go back to some of those stories.
more than likely marvel took a good look at the strange world box office and said   yeah  we re not gonna get to that point.
guardians is usually a sure thing  people seem to be raving about the holiday special. its still not enough to make me visit my friend that has disney  .
almost to 100k. ya love to see it! you hit the nail on the head with one  of many  problems with current mcu films  there are no high stakes because the multiverse exists. that makes these films just slugfests with crappy writing. who can get excited for a boring film the other major problem is  of course  all of the woke shit. personally  I refuse to see any marvel film that isn t gotg  and if I catch the slightest hint that they ve effed up that franchise too  I ll write that one off.
the mighty morphin power rangers  that episode youre referring to yeah I remember that one - it was a one-part episode  and it involved a troll doll that trinI s mother    gave her which became possessed - and that was more or less a dream sequence  and it was done without any multiverse afterthought
my thoughts on this are  I think they have been pushing these movie out too much and forgetting there own movies like  big hero 6  atlantis  and  treasure planet   I been waiting for year for the second movie for big hero 6 to drop. but if they were to go back to working on their own stories for a bit and take a break from marvel  and star wars  they may be able to give us good marvel movies again.
I wonder about the potential of machine learning to aid in the creation of cgi.  if the program could be taught basic principles of mechanics and optics  perhaps the artist could just sketch out the basic scene and describe colors and such and let the program generate the fine details  saving a lot of time and effort.
the 90s spiderman animated series was one of the best cartoons ever  if not the best
phase four is over so its only for phase 5. Im optimistic that this will be good because its james gunn! he made the other two well and the better version of the suicide squad so we ll have to see how it ends for our characters
missing our melonie mac
we ll have to see what all these  changes  will bring  but Im not holding my breath.
I love hearing your point of view. thanks  melonie.
I just want a great moon knight movie.
I think that maybe  just maybe  studio execs are beginning to finally realize that woke doesnt sell. they are pushing these things out like they are on an assembly line and the quality just goes down with each one. maybe they are beginning to finally see the light.
I can imagine a movie where they send back someone in time to the end game gem collection phase or something.. so they can scrap all the m-she-u movies with that
for me  Im not one of those   it ll take years for marvel to earn back my trust  people because something like this was bound to happen. the momentum was bound to slow down but as long as you stick with it and realize that not every movie is bound to be a hit  and in some cases turn out to become flops  you ll see that this is just 1 out of 4 phases that haven t been up to quality with the phases before. the mcu will be just as great as it was at the start  this is the beginning of that  and I ll be proud to say I stuck through all of the highs and lows of the mcu.
as many others have pointed out  it isn t fatigue of comic book projects movies  it is fatigue of how dull this phase has been -- with the exception of the nostalgia blast that was no way home. the new guardians trailer is the first trailer since spiderman to make me actually want to go to the theater. thatsaid even if marvel steps it up with quality again  I dont think Im as eager to go back to it  as now they have a continuity issue with all that was phase bore  which sucks as the fantastic four are my favorite marvel property  and with the mcu I had hopes of them being done right  but I guess it wasn t meant to be lol.
spider-man movies from now on will feel like a soft reboot.
I think phase 4 should be called the multiverse of madness  not just one movie.
to me  its already too late. I just dont care anymore. its a shame  up until endgame I got so excited with each movie!
gotg is the last marvel fan I actually wanna see and still have my doubts
nobody likes dream sequences  they are almost equivalent to multiverse. things happen for a reason. 90 s era is the best of everything! I remember a slight feeling of dread underneath all the awesome of the 90 s. which was the thought  canthings continue to keep getting more awesome
I totally agree that it has changed so much throughout the years but I think that they need to change it back to old classic cartoons that we kids grow up with when we were young back in the days and they have to go with the old classic cartoon movies and stay with it instead of making new movies that we didn t grow up with from our childhood days  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and make a comment on this video for today. anyway I hope you understand what I am meaning to say bout this video  ok melonie. anyway I hope you are doing well with yourself and hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
the only way they could ever explain the isolated stories despite them meaning to be parts of a big puzzle  is if they confirmed that all of these shows and movies that aren t tied to previous entries like eternals  ms marvel  etc were in their own separate universes and then had something cooked up for all of them in phase 5 and 6 for the big showdown of merging realities n stuff.
spider man was soo cool on 90 s and first years of 2000. that ps1 game was an exemple how cool spidey was. rock songs  action  stan lee  welcome true believers!
I do agree with you that we are not going to totally win the culture war. people like me have stopped going to these movies I dont care anymore because they ve done it to me. bad business is being in business and a project lose 100 million dollars. longevity wise there is no future in that type of business. if its not broke dont fix it  is what they should have stuck to. movies like toy story classic still better than the crap they put out now
I have no hope from this article. disney said they might be taking a bigger part in the msheu for phases 5 and 6 to.. improve graphics. disney having a bigger hand in it means even more woke narratives  imo  and better graphics wont fix that. looks like I tapped out from marvel movies right around the right time.  I never made it through the thanos era  but infinite wars looked pretty good.  hard pass on any marvel properties until if when disney drops them.
she came she saw  and she yet again dropped the facts  melonie is a legend bro  I want this beautiful lady to reach 100 000 subs let s make it happen she deserves it for sure  getting close though
dolph lundgren s punisher and blade are the best marvel movies
melonie! youre speakin  my language! 90s spider-man cartoon was so good! no way home was really good  but yes the multi-verse is a little too star-wars-nobody-ever-dies reset button cop out. love your videos!
they keep saying this..but with disney its always  bait and switch   if they fire kathleen kennedy and kevin feige then I ll reconsider giving them a chance.
I actually enjoyed the new spider-man movies  and my only real complaint was the changes to mj.  otherwise I was very pleased with them.  as for phase 4 I enjoyed shang-chI  tony leung   michelle yeoh were just awesome to see  and I didn t completely hate doctor strange  but thats my love of sam raimI clouding my judgement  Im sure .  the only d  show that Ive enjoyed was moon knight.  otherwise phase 4 could be termed phase bore.  this garbage has to stop!  even the things Ive enjoyed have had many things that they could have done better.  thanks for the video  yet another great take that is much needed!
Im new to your content and may I say thank you for challenging this bullshit opposed to catering to it! 90 s kids represent!
just remember the media tried this narrative already  after thor  dark world.  how did that  fatigue  turn out for the infinity saga
hoping for a good non woke moon knight season 2!
remember when you would be excited about a new marvel movie coming out nope
I stopped thinking marvel anymore.  I think disney.  the mouse is frustrated.  what s more frustrating to disney is the copyright for the earliest version of mickey mouse and many more of its beloved characters will expire in 2024 and will enter public domain.  I can imagine some pretty rude t-shirts of those characters.
wouldn t it be cool if disney did something different and focus on the formation on a group of super villains like masters of evil or so
fiege never said phases after phase 3 were going to go exactly like how phases  1-3 went. and why would you want it to be setup the same  talk about boring and predictable. you clowns I tell ya.
@elden wolf Lord  yes  because insulting is a good way to produce fruitful conversations and make valid points. thank you for letting me know I d be wasting my time with you.
he chucks a knife at this geisha crime boss s forehead.  and its a special effects puppet when the knife hits her   winner right there. the dolph punisher
if they fire them at the sun I will watch again.
@elden wolf Lord  did I hurt your fe fes
@jeremy kirkham  who are you  learn english composition and how to  read the room .
@elden wolf Lord  your comment means nothing.
@elden wolf Lord  you absolutely were talking to me. you specifically tagged me in your comments. you look like a wally.
ikr make mj mary jane again
I ll give y all 2 instances where it was all a dream work s and where it doesnt.  works  american psycho  with Christian bale  doesnt work  twilight  the fight in the snow covered field at the end of the last movie.  two examples of how to do  or not do something.  peace and love y all
I think the best thing they can do at this point is say everything post endgame wasn t canonical  essentially publicly admitting they screwed up with this phase  and just start over from that point. but good this time.
notifications go boom always look forward to your takes!
I enjoyed the late 1960s spider-man cartoons.  they were fun.
woke  its not about money  its about sending a message    see the world burn joker  yooo wtf!!
they were too intimidated to include the snap and blip in movies after endgame  thats why they resorted to the multiverse. I loved agents of shield while it was strongly connected to the movies  but when they ignored the snap and blip in season 6  they died for me. wish there were more movies still intertwined like before
imagine that.. we might actually get a male hero someday
would be epic if they just made captain america have a bad dream as phase 4 then continue on
thanks for the shout out again  thought I d suggest something potentially positive!
never doubt kevin fiege.
yeah  its amazing. I have 0 movies I am looking forward to. the issue is that marvel sort of killed a bunch of other movies so nothing else really came out  maybe once in a while . so now there s zero interesting marvel movies and almost nothing else either. have to go delve into the indie pile... but its super hard to actually sort out which movies are good.
it used to be when marvel made a misstep they made an effort to correct it. nowadays they double down.
they couldn t handle the heat of their own fallout
most fans are at a point where we dont care anymore... for me personally she-hulk was the last straw because they dared to green-light thatshit
disney   marvel  what did we do wrong fans  go woke go broke. disney   marvel  but  what did we do wrong. fans  ... you went woke. disney   marvel  no  really  what did we do wrong fans  I give up.
I haven t seen much  just spiderman movies  past endgame because it was one hell of an  ending  and set the bar very high for anything coming after. when the next phase came out it was turd after turd so you could imagine any interest was lost. a good chunk of the problem is the message being written in  followed by the writers f cking around  or rather ignoring  with the original source material  making whites black  men into women  and anyone else totally useless. I wonder how cumberbatch honestly felt when he noticed his dr. strange character would ve been taking a backseat in his own movie...
they say they are going for quality over quantity but disney has assured everyone that they are going to continue pushing their regressive identity politics  so I have no hope that phase 5 will be any better.  the next guardians movie has me a little hopeful but after that gunn is gone  so it may be a rare gem amongst the crud and not to be repeated.
they need to redo phase 4. Im not gonna know what s going on in phase 5 because Im didn t watch everything in phase 4.
its not a good sign that james gunn is leaving for dc after the next guardians of the galaxy. I honestly think the damage has been done. its a giant hole to dig themselves out of.with spider-man  I still hate what they ve done with mj. I need my first crush  the ginger mj  back
I think there definitely is superhero fatigue......

even dc is getting too much  how many times can batman really say  Im batman   now with voice changer included   if you look at every superhero film they all start blending into one aswell  even without marvel and dc being woke.
I agree  thats not my mary jane. Im a black male and I grew up reading and collecting spiderman and the mj in the current mcu  isn t my mj  she s just a diversity hire  mj isn t black  she s white. why would you change a major character s race
Im wondering how much things will change with bob paychek now out the door and iger back in thatseat. shit  might  go back to phase 1-3 levels  but who really knows. feige could have gotten wokewashed himself. but to be fair  these special presentations might end up being a good thing. werewolf by night was perfect  and that guardians holiday show was actually decent. could be a good way to get stories rolling prior to a movie without enduring a tv series.
its never to late to put out good content because there will always be a high demand for good entertainment. one movie wont change the reputation marvel disney has acquired just like one bad movie didn t change the marvel reputation during phase 2-3. marvel disney cantotally rebuild there reputation with consistent good quality movies focusing of storytelling!!
the the guardian of the galaxy is my favorite movies that I like watching a lot and I seen guardians of the galaxy holiday special  its good and funny.
there may be hope after they bring in mutants or even the ff. the truth is the avengers dont have a lot of good characters to chose from. they have second captain marvel and hercules and not many more a left to replace the big names they have lost. and I think they already screwed up hiring a tv level actress to pay photon  second captain marvel  or whatever her name is going to be.
fingers crossed but I reverse my doubts.
I dont think phase 4 is horrible. its just thatsince marvel is putting out a lot more content there seems to be more mediocrity than usual. if you compare it with the good stuff its actually on par with phase 1   2.
marvel really messed things up with phase 4 between the poor quality content and the sheer amount of it. apathy has set in with audiences  especially the most important ones  the kids who would have refreshed the ranks   and they re moving on to other things as hollywood is already churning out their next obsession  video game adaptations. can superheroes make a comeback  sure  but it will take a long time to build that goodwill back up
this topic hit home bruh.
I know this is off topic. yet  I would rather have a melonie mac host rather than a frosk every day of the week.
disney and marvel are in a death spiral from which there is no recovery.
pushing the message was and is the biggest problem I have with the mcu. dont share the hate of the multiversal stuff since that will come to a head eventually with a secret wars movie or trilogy I am sure  which will affect the mcu we know and the other universes we ve clashed with  meaning its canon and has an affect on the canon. but thats information I have from old cartoons and comics  and I hope it does well. the pushing of the message has made itso I have skipped most of the recent stuff  dont feel entertainment needs to push the moral high ground as it were to be fun or enjoyable  heck in most places it hurts them. appreciate the video melonie!
the quality isn t improving because around 15 years ago the studios started making exorbitant amount of money off of the movies  so they decide  well  we re good with that for now  where can we make more now   and so the new tech and techniques were utilized to speed everything up  make more faster easier quicker cheaper  because if we had a movie now that took as much work as the Lord of the rings or original the matrix  I can assure you it would be polished  but time is a resource studios have least difficulty turning into money and deem anything  we could do it in a month well or in a week meh or ok  it will still sell  a good enough reason to cut on time and maximize profit vs costs ratio. improving the quality would extend the time required to produce the project which is a cost studios management aren t willing to pay  period.
Imissed out on the power rangers. I was in my 20s in the 90s.
mcu is done for me.  good points thou  mel
hopefully this is more then just pr and marvel has actually noticed their mistakes and try to correct.
melonie diet and exercise routine is working one of the fittest female youtubers damn
I hope phase 4 was just the bad bump that every series franchise and that has and can get better. will be ghard to do but would like to be excited for mcu releases again.
I like the first 2 sony fantastic 4 movies
if cgI quality hasn t increased over the past decade   then they should be cheaper and movies should cost less.
change  I dont think so. for things to change  first they would have to ignore orders from their overLords  second they would have to fire all the writers directors etc. who hate the source material fans  third they would have to admit the first two were actually a thing and needed to be changed! only when those things happen will I believe things will truly change and not the fake changes to fool you into thinking things are different but are really not! these people only change when they have no choice!
the key word there is consistent. judging by how badly the andor series did  its entirely possible to burn your fans enough that they wont pay attention to just one good movie show.at least for me  the first 5 episodes of she-hulk were bad enough to completely destroy whatever enthusiasm I had left for the mcu  and they ll need to make something really good to bring me back.
@healed1337  absolutely  one good movie wont change shit  but second good movie ppl are talking  third good movie in a row ppl will get optimistic about marvels future  by 5th good movie will be back the way they should have been. as long as there isn t 3 woke movies between the good marvel will recover cuz of its high demand for good entertainment. I really hope marvel... no disney changes their ways cuz Imiss good movies and shows.
youre not wrong but once the figurative ship gets off course its not that easy getting itsteered back in the right direction.  and if it was just one or two bad offerings their reputation wouldn t take a hit.  but we ve recently suffered through a whole string of subpar to outright bad movies and d  shows.  for many long time fans of both marvel and star wars like myself the trust that new material will be good has dissipated into nothing.  they have a long way to go to regain that trust.  and with the way they love to blame fans instead of looking in the mirror I wont believe in these supposed big changes until we see them.
@cory82  but unfortunately disney owns marvel so I wouldn t get ur hopes up
@sega nerd 1991  I know  that why I said  marvel disney . disney will have to change because the shareholders are super pissed that they re losing money. when disney changes it will trickle down to marvel  lucas films etc... kathleen kennedy is gone after indiana jones  thats a step forward  disney has already put out a statement admitting defeat for the woke agenda  thats another step forward. it takes a couple years to make a movie so you probably wont notice the change right away but they will change. disney will not go bankrupt over identity politics and making progressives happy. you are completely na ve if thats what you think. when push comes to shove people are still greedy. and now that this shareholders are aware of what s going on there is a lot of pressure on disney to start making money again.
@cory82  cause the fact is they will never change Im tired of people having stockholm syndrome when it comes to hollywood its really sad
and maybe  maybe the superhero-era is slowly fading out anyway. phase iv with the awful scripts and all did only speed up that process  imo. franchise fatigue  thats a new expression there and maybe just the right one to describe that the consumers are getting tired of all these superhero stuff that has poured out of disney like rain in a thunder storm. maybe the era is simply almost over. well... they always have starwars to put down to rest for good next... they are almost there. I am almost to believe that they already ruined the biggest cash-cow franchise in movie-history. well done disney  good job  no one else could have done itso fast so thoroughly. damn disney... you are really good at this.
they re making changes because the movies are getting way expensive and becoming less profitable  especially when budgets are pushing on  300 million. changes are always a response to financial performance.personally speaking I want too see an end to comic book films not because woke  politics nor anything like that but rather due the fact they choking out good movies from being made add the fact they re all but repetitive.
you gotta do better disney... you gotta do better what if at the end of the marvels.. all of them go on a mission... suddenly rogue come and  steal her power... camera move behind we see mystique is behind her.. end credit close
phase 4 is the pandemic phase. it 100  gets a free pass. the movie industry as a whole has been trash since 2020 started.  there has been less than a handful of movies outside marvel ones that have even been amazing. that is really saying something about the pandemic affect at large. so much so I think top gun maverick was the one truly great film released since then.
do you mean save phase 5 and 6
Im more fascinated by how fast you can ruin a decade s worth of story telling in just 2 years.
until the people making the decisions that have led us here are fired  no  nothing will change.in fact  all signs indicate things will actually get worse for the mcu with the recently re-hired bob iger stating that disney will triple-down on their current course of identity politics.
yay melonie !
can honestly say the whole superhero genre has lost its spark  not just mcu  dc aswell and not just because almost everyone is complaining about everything woke its more to do with the fact that watching superhero movies over and over and over again without breaks is the same as the fbI  cia or some black ops american agency putting you in a room blasting death metal over again just to torture you.
kevin feesh. I love that.
the last mcu movie I saw and wanted to see was black widow. scarlett is a great actress and natasha was a great character. I refuse to willingly give money to a company that pushes the skittle people agenda. they think they have the right to teach my kids about sex and I refuse to support them.
I ll believe it when I see it  but in order for me to believe it I need to see all the woke executives packed up and shipped out.
that power rangers episode messed me up as a kid lol!
marvel has lost its core audience  marvel fans  were all to eager to spend their money on all things marvel but with the hollywood agenda being focused on so heavily  poor casting choices and lackluster special effects vfx. it has very clearly lost its value. sure there are many that enjoy some of the latest movies and comics and that is fine  good for you  but the rest of us are mostly just feeling the fatigue.  but still enjoy going back to the comics and movies from 10-15 years ago and beyond
the reason the avenger s worked was they had classic heroes. they did not force a message of inclusion. the marvel universe is already full of diverse characters. the heavy-handed approach to swapping characters to be inclusive is insulting. we cheered ripley in aliens  was thatshe was a woman she was and heroic at the same time. she did not have to gain muscles or be toxic to men. even with terminator sarah connors was a woman   but her change was a character growth to defend against something stronger than her  and yes she bulked up and the reason was clear.  the captain america staying with carter after was dropping off the gem was out of his character  everything up to that moment was cap.
I think there s a different and pertinent question to ask. does disney deserve success at this point  itseems petulant I know but honestly  if they were to change course it would only be because they have to make some money. the people who pushed the socio-political messaging will still be there  just muted for the moment. at the first opportunity they will go back to their inclusivity orgy and make things awful. I believe the answer is no. I dont demand anyone follow this example but I d love to see more people do so. hold disney accountable for what they ve done and starve them out. be honest  most of what they produce is awful anyway. just let them go.
I like it when you go boom!
I thought the tom holland spiderman movies were pretty good. then  I went back and watched the sam raimI spiderman trilogy. wow  so much better. still corny and cringe in places  but far superior  imo. spiderman 2 is a good example of why I like superhero movies. also watched amazing spiderman  again not nearly as good as sam raimI s.
remove the core issue  the special k  both of them
nah the boys is great and invincible
@they call me mr plenty  the boys dont really fall into the superhero or super villain  category  thats more super powered super soldiers with psychological  daddy and mommy issues  along with bad drinking habits and drug addiction.
doesnt matter what you do with the fantastic four themselves  the movie s going to fail unless they get doom right.
I thought the fantastic four 2000 s movies were awesome dont understand the hate
going woke and going broke... who knew
1  yes  agreed2  your tattoos are lovely  just like you
they can afford good writers. but they will hire inexperienced  woke writers and pay them 3 cents.
anyone who thinks that disney marvel will change their approach in phase 5 6 are sorely mistaken. if you have seen any footage or bob iger s commentary during his first big meeting  its clear he is trying to play both sides of the fence but he has no real intention of stopping the woke train.train is a good analogy I like to use for the disney marvel woke movement. it is full speed ahead now and it wont just stop. they ve gone so far in on it how could they  they have race gender swapped so many characters and changed so much  its too late. can you imagine what the internal disney employee weirdos or the woke mob would do if marvel suddenly cancelled plans for the iron heart show  thatshow alone has already casted a trans and a drag queen. marvel would be burned to the ground for cancelling this crap they have slated.the bottom line is  they dont want to. bob iger said himself  they value the inclusion and do not feel they are doing wrong  they are simply  telling a story  with their movies. the typical approach  its not them..they re just telling a story  its us...we re weird and racist etc.
you all dont remember the classic spiderman and his amazing friends cartoon. and the masterpiece that was the 80 s hulk cartoon  especially when he fought quasimodo. hulk wasn t a twitter gimp back then. he looked mean and pissed as fuck.
I think marvel disney can garner back most of what was lost if they stick to the characters as they were intended   bring back quality of story   vfx... maybe slow down production of mediocre at best disney  shows for God s sake. alas  that will most certainly not happen. they ve ruined a lot for most everyone who isn t an activist nutter who doesnt buy the product anyway.
only a retcon can save them now. the state of the overall plot is completely shattered because of endgame  lokI  wandavision  no way home  and multiverse of madness. there cant be stakes anymore. people can just get powers by being near another person with powers. characters are irreversibly damaged at their core.the well is poisoned. nobody wants to drink from it anymore with a major excavation to fix the problem. the only  and Imean only  good thing that came out of phase 4 was spider man s position at the end of the movie. its a shame  but that would have to go too.
we will never again see something on the level of the winter soldier. not from marvel.
sad to watch them ruin daredevil. probably end up ruining punisher as well. sucks! I ll just buy the netflix versions and watch them over and over lol
phase 4 was so bad that I nearly didn t watch the third spiderman film. only the rumors of the spidey cameos won me over. otherwise  the announcement of anything mcu  tv series or movies  now makes me want to tune out. as said by many  superhero fatigue is not the issue. it is bad entertainment fatigue that is the issue.
why can marvel not make a decent   let alone good  fantastic four movie but pixar did two
too late now. they sidelined  wokified  or destroyed all their remaining heavy hitters  sam wilson  bucky  daredevil  luke cage  iron fist  punisher  ghost rider  blade  doctor strange  thor  lokI  antman  wanda  vision  and captain marvel  in favor of wasting resources and time on trying to force feed the audience garbage they weren t interested in. the only things disney has not made toxic and been able to milk to stay afloat is the mandalorian and spiderman. knock on wood for both.
Im excited for a marvel movie. and by marvel movie Imean a movie using marvel characters  not an mcu film. its spider-verse 2
in my eyes they ve done too much damage. the characters I love d  are so warped and twisted with these token versions and woke agendas that they re unrecognizable. this includes the comics. I havent read an american comic in over 3 years. mind you  Im 35. Ive been reading the books since I could read. perhaps if a normal company purchased the rights from disney  but thats a pipe dream.
I stopped watching them after thanos killed everybody. it was a perfect ending and something they could go back two years down the line. now they re meaningless and overdone  Ive always wanted to see a gambit movie and I dont know why they ve never done a cyclops movie  if they have Imust have missed them since I quit watching
yeah  I think it can git gud again. Im certainly not about to hold my breath  but I do think it is possible.
aside from obviously spider-man  shang chI  moon knight and hawkeye  phase 4 for me was marvel s filler phase. and a lot of it was pointless. also  dr. strange multiverse of madness was an overhyped disappointment. y all got cameos from mr fantastic  black bolt  and professor x. and yet they have wanda kill all of them with ease. and the whole plot completely falls flat once yourealize america chavez was an unneeded plot device.
the cgI  graphics quality  is widely known to smart people due to thr fact the cgI workers are being over worked. there is not enough people innthe industry to take on the non stop onslaught of so many more mcu properties. plus other movies. like avatar and such. hence the reduction in cgI quality. and that is the last thing I am worried about when it comes to me enjoying a movie.
man  I was actually a little disappointed with the mid credits scene in nwh when tom hardy disappeared  really hoped to see a venom spidey reboot cuz I hated the spiderman 3 venom

yeah  that multi-verse crap has got to go.  honestly  I wish they had just used the tobey spider-man in the mcu and that the andrew movies were never made.  I also wish that...- mantis had her scanty outfit and fighting skills from the comics  instead of those weird powers and getting covered up from head to toe- adam warlock had been introduced prior to the infinity saga  since he s supposed to be kind of important to that- black widow s origin story movie was better and released at a more appropriate time- t challa was re-cast  since chadwick and his family all wanted that  and they did that to jim rhodes  even though his first actor is still alive  or that chadwick didn t die - betty ross wasn t written out- she-hulk had a competent writing team  who did her character justice  pardonthe expression  - and that the first guardians movie used the original hooked on a feeling song  by b.j. thomas  instead of thatstupid cover.
fire the activists that are making them lose money along with the delusional visionaries like kk and woke washed kf. ask jon favreau to be the mcu lead and bring back the russo brothers. axe some of the d  shows. also keep self indulgent over stylistic directors like taika and gunn away. sure gotg 3 looks good  but he tends to go over the top with wackiness.
please change the title. phase 4 is over. its 5 6. edit  thank you
multiverse stuff is a lazy way of excusing inconsistencies by simply switching plotlines and characters whenever convenient rather than writing a coherent script.
nope. nothing is gonna make me ho back unless they thanos snap all the woke stuff from canon.
this charlie brown ain t gonna take a run at that ball again  mc-lucy-u. black widow - pointless  kind of annoying  why give olga kuryenko only 20 seconds of face time     eternals - just mystifying  I kept waiting for the tone to rise above a long tv show with cheap costumes  and anyone notice how underpowered and trivial the weapons are    shang-chI - wasted opportunity to bring some real style  beauty and grace into the mcu  but seriously why have ben kingsley and the creature with head up ass in the pointless subplot about being captured by the 10 rings    dr strange - made me confused  where is dr strange  what  is this a scarlet witch movie   then angry  this is a scarlet witch movie  wtf     then just bored an numb. none of the tv shows worked for me  wandavision had a couple of interesting ideas and then I realized it was a plot carousel just to spin people out to various follow-ups. the rest were dull  vapid  trival  trite and in some cases irritating  she-hulk  which left me wondering whether a tv series of creature with head up ass would be better .
the thing with marvel forming their own inhouse vfx studio is laughable.... one of the reasons why cgI is so bad and inconsistent for a lot of their recent movies is because people dont want to work for them and the companies that do partner up with them dont want to do it ever again because disney treats them badly with un-realistic demands and other things.if the cgI is bad and inconsistent  that is pretty much due to whatever talent they can scrape from the bottom of the recruitment pool...oh  and activists. you might know fuck all about animation but if you support the message then youre pretty much hired.marvel saying they are forming their own inhouse vfx studio wont change a thing unless the culture within disney marvel changes and that aint gonna happen any time soon.
one of their plans should include not making garbage like she-hulk
the mcu phase bore has been soulless. not sure why I was supposed to support an obnoxious protagonist like she-hulk.
personally  I feel its too late. Im only interested guardians of the galaxy vol. 3. but I know that is going to be a sad story. and the last of the gotg franchise.
its not just quality. nearly all the movies now are pretty much cookie cutter. the mcu is completely detached from any of the original work much like the new comics. the writing is poor  the cgI sucks  the plot line sucks  and the focus is primarily on  the message.  once I realized disney was no longer interested in making movies that were good I washed my hands of everything disney. I no longer am interested in getting invested in a movie series that is guaranteed to be a mixture of crap one liners mixed with wokeist preaching. it would take them producing and releasing a full series without the b.s. before I would even attempt to watch any of it. the preach wokisim here and in other countries release versions without the b.s. they shoot movies in china near slave camps  yet through their movies tell us how we should act and think. hypocrites.
melonie  I know a lot of the marvel content hasn t been to the level itshould  but if you haven t watched them  wakanda forever and werewolf by night are genuinely great pieces of content that feel like classic marvel.  I agree a lot of the more recent content has been subpar to say the least  looking at you thor  ms. marvel  she hulk   but you should give the two Imentioned a genuine shot  I think you ll enjoy them a lot!
just look up  incredible hulk. when monsters meet  hulk vs quasimodo. the 80 s hulk cartoon. do it.
hollywoke
press  marvel is reportedly refocusing on quality over quantity for phases 5 and 6.me  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...  brief but quick inhale  ...hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... ahh  ah. hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. ahh  oh  ah whew!  deep inhale  slow exhale yeah! right! you mean disney isn t giving you enough money to make so many movies.
iron heart let it go
welcome back to youtube!
to save mcu gog wont save them but drop the wokeness
love the thumbnail you look in loves with chris pratt hahahahha
hey melonie have you ever played the wolfenstein games they are fun
guardians is gunna hit just cus goofy shit is their thing
subtitles please  deaf dude here.
let s take a look at all these superhero movies. we have a hero who goes through some hardships. there is an evil villain who we are lead to believe the hero s cannot defeat. the hero fights the villain and loses. he then does some shallow soul searching and discovers the key to defeating the villain is within him herself. hero then defeats the villain. Imean how many times can you make the same movie and just interchange the characters  couple that with the creators taking source material and trashing it and people are just not watching. you know what s going to happen and we ve seen all the wow cgI and it all looks the same now. stories  people! stories!
I think they would rather double down on bad.  look at kathleen kennedy.   she s not changing anything.  she retconned indiana jones out of existence.   thats not a studio that wants to get better.  why would another disney studio not follow that example
once you fuck something  you cant unfuck it. so no  it is not possible to fix the crap they produced in phase 4.I ll admit mcu spidey grew on me. still looking forward to future spidey movies and gotg  thats about it.
star wars  star trek  doctor who  marvel  rings of power  wheel of time  willow  terminator  ghostbusters indiana jones is next they are doing a speed run of bastardizing intellectual properties that were once beloved.
yes  I do. thats the thing. it was only four years ago. they destroyed the biggest  most successful franchise in history in less than four years.
phase 4 is already over. it ended with black panther wakanda forever
maybe by  quality  they mean more diversity   representation for modern audiences.
its gotten to the point where if I hear that disney or marvel is involved  Im skipping it.  at least I can save a lot of time and put it toward entertainment that is actually good.  apparently now  they are actively working on destroying indian jones.  they are killing indy off and replacing him with some annoying actress.
they just need to stop listening to the clowns
sorry  disney. I try not to give my money to people who hate everything about who I am as a person. Im out.
no. marvel studios is completely woke now
why does the title say  save 4   5  shouldn t itsay 5   6   lol
mel  merry early Christmas
the last marvel related movie I wanted to watch was logan. everything since hasn t appealed to me.
I hate to say it but  phase 4  is almost synonymous with  stage 4  where marvel is concerned.
too little too late for marvel
yes the last good marvel movie was infinity wars
oops youre right
@melonie mac go boom  its ok. we all fail once in a while.for instance  im gonna try not to simp for ya and fail miserably..
not if the actors named chris leave. robert is already gone  and without c.p. and c.h. I have much doubt. just look at what they have done so far  not encouraging.
I was wondering where the hell you got to lil ladyI was missing that accent
love coming to your videos to see which name you mispronounce. feige- feegscorsese- score seeslove itfeige- fI gee. g as in goosescorsese- score say seetrying to help you out melanie.  but still love your videos.
video game people effects and all on the big budget games are overworked too.
waiting on the big rrrreeeeeee to come from the woke  should be soon
Ive skipped every movie for this phase .  even before the wokeness I found the movies boring. course that might be my un diagnosed add.
they need to cancel echo  agatha and iron heart  nobody asked for those garbage..
love you
corporate fatigue would be a more correct expression.
you should keep your hair that way for a while
Im out after guardians 3. no one I care about will be left
if they gonna retcon phase bore and straightened things out and respect the source material to some extent maybe  and stop the virtue signaling.
doubt it
franchise fatigue  my ass more like political agenda fatigue.
too little too late marvel.
analytics
how many old fans actually want it to get better after the insults and poor content
marry meeeeeeee!!!!!!
I dont know. just saw the guardians of the galaxy holiday special and it was super woke garbage. Im amazed they even allow that on disney anything for the matter.
I was sitting here thinking  like  realistically I d be fine if they kept all the heros they introduced  poorly  the captian marvel  the eternals  like I am totally fine with them adding some color and boobies to the roster lmao  like just actually make the shit the boobies and the color are in actually good shows lmao. like make she hulk and captain marvel etc. actually likeable characters. make their stories actually make sense. and for the love of God stop making the actors race gender and sexuality the selling point of the fucking product lmao. also dont come at me like Im racist or sexist for saying it lmao  Im just pointing out the reality that these woke people seem to consistently think about others in that fashion. strictly what color are you  what sex gender are you
@meloniemacgoboom
I dont care about the multiverse as much as I do that the story telling is trash.studios will reboot their properties whether there s a multiverse or not.this is just studio executives having the guts to admit thats what they are doing.
it wont matter either way now. because the simple fact is 4 existed and so anything after it will always have all this dogshit precede and tie into for continuity s sake. there s no fixing it now.
marvel 4 is done and ruined. I dont know what kind of changes could go back in time 6 years ago and fix it from the blueprints
if you guys dont want disney to do marvel stuff then why not just find a way to revive it. they did to harvey comics so why cant you
you lost me at  m  she  u ...
the marvel universe is long dead to me. there is nothing they can do to save it.
south park was kinda right
I was never really excited for a mcu movie because they were never that good begin with.
honestly I think they should go away from super hero movies for a while and try other things.  they are ruining them and we have all seen batman  superman  spider-man restart over and over eat too often.
multiverses  along with wokeness  needs to be dropped.
hImel my name is mike I just want to let you know that I subscribed to your melanie plays gaming channel ps I think youre cute
the roses are dead
phase 4  more like phase bore.
no  the answer is no.
fi-gee
no......
I haven t been excited since dr strange 2. thor I knew it wasn t gonna be better than ragnarok.  mcu is trash rn and I say that as a huge fan. she hulk killed disney plus mcu shows for me. no faith  in the shows rn
too late  Im done with the mcu already.
its bullcrap fatigue 100 . spiderman was made for the fans and made bank as a result. this isn t hard
the multiverse is just such a waste because of the implementation.  any concept of a multiverse has to have severe limitations and difficulties or its just some easy peasy deus ex machina to solve any issues created by awful script writing.  its bs and the mcu ended with endgame.
spiderman is owned by sonythat is why spiderman movies are better.
I dont really get excited about movies as of late. they all seem to suck.
good morning  not wokie
no. once the original actors and those playing the popular characters move on  we ll just have a bunch of karens  race baiters and rainbow flag wavers.
I no longer get excited or care at all about the mcu.
I wish I still enjoyed marvel movies. disney doesnt make marvel movies. they make agenda movies. I am truly and utterly disappointed.
I dont think marvel will be able to make another good movie  I think they and other big usa movie companies have lost the plot  they try too hard to be funny  keep doing remakes  b grade horror  and disaster movies that are ridiculous.
man youre beautiful
bullcrap fatigue
yeah  I would only watch simply to id the woke garbage and laugh at how hard disney is trying to force it on their demographicsI still remember my dad and I nearly coming in our pants when iron man first hit theaters...for shits sake  all the movie writers have to do is read the fucking comic books for the plot.  stan lee must be rolling over in his grave...rip to a legend of comics
Im sorry I love your content but imo you should watch the movies before you make a comment on them. dont just go off of what you hear from the internet. in all honesty yes phase 4 isn t perfect but its not a complete shitshow. I feel like people just love to complain for complaining sake instead of trying to find some enjoyment out of the flaws.
no its dead and have my baby
the fact that they call it  re-focusing  means they knew they were letting it go to sh-.  lmao.  f-- disney marvel lucasfilm starwars willow indiana jones.  I dont even care about guardians of the galaxy 3 and it looks like it might be decent.  dont even care about cant man 3.  I ll wait for reviews on deadpool 3 before even checking it out.  they think we owe them money to watch their garbage.  then if you dont like it youre an  insert whatever _ist.  now suddenly they re surprised not too many liked it and  oh no we gotta re-focus on quality.   someone signed off on all the sh-- shows that were released and Im pretty sure it wasn t the marvel studios disney janitor.
it doesnt matter if they make changes.  those franchises are dead.  marvel s m-she-u is dead  star wars is dead  they are killing willow right now  not like that was ever a franchise .  not to mention all the live-action  remakes  of the old classics  and the remakes are horrible too ..   basically everything coming out of disney is better not watching at all.  because its all guaranteed to be woke trash.
btw my bday js in dec 11 this sunday
no
hI beautiful
disney marvel is truly dead!  the only way out is if disney sells marvel to someone who gives a shit about the franchise  then that person trashes all the current disney marvel crap and starts over with the fantastic four.  we dont need disney marvel  there is all the infinity marvel movies that were made before disney  you can just skip capt. marvel and the series runs just fine .
the woke started making movies and personally I have not liked a lot of new releases at all quickly made and poorly done and bad bad acting
disney marvel is dead
the mcu was never good
look everyone its a movie about a comicbook character. like they say comic movies have killed the movie star. no one goes for the actor  but the character they play no more or less. samuel l jackson I hate to say it has lost all his badass character ability when I saw jack furry get his ass kicked by a dumb cat  and theats why he doesnt have an eye. anyone can be the comicbook character its not hard their whole life can be read before you even step infront of a camera. so the actors job is already done all they have to do is read the stupid script. so ya actors are dead and over paid for their non-work. been on many sets and yes the actors do non-work.
4 starters phase 4 has no quality the 1st 3 phases of the mcu was great phase 4 is dog crap I call bs on disney making quality phase 5 and 6 and now they want to be create a new team thats not fixing crap marvel needs to delete phase 4 and start it from the begging b4 talking about phase 5 and 6
I grew up in the 70s and I still keep up with spawn but marvel lost me with all the multiverse bull shit. these movies just suck the last spider-man was the last I went to see. I ll never go to the movies to see anymore marvel movies. and why would anyone else just let it bomb and buy the cheap ass dvd. and if they bomb bad enough it ll be on netflix or some other service instantly.
stop supporting wokism. make the sacrifice. or else youre not doing any good. just talking and complaining so what  stop watching movies get rid of your pay subscriptions and find other things to do in life.
nah... marvel is dead to me.
eternals was boring as hell
what  y all either have no taste or are just easily manipulated. marvel has 4 maybe 5 good movies at best the rest are subpar and out of 25  movies that is a very bad ratio. phase 4 is actually the first time they break the mold and its just as successful as the other phases. the only movie to earn under 400 000 000 in box office was black widow and thats basically because it came out on disney  the same time and its actually more successful captain america the first avenger which has the lowest box office of marvel film it must be because its horrible woke trash right
I stopped caring about marvel movies. they re boring and preachy
