gurl bye  the backstory they created for him was incredibly powerful
she complains about how they pronounced namor but then she calls him the  sub-mareener.
anytime Im feeling down I always remember Im not following accounts like this and it makes everything better
they changed it to talocan because they wanted to set themselves apart from dc  aquaman already holds atlantis in people s minds . and tenoch huerta is also relatively new  so getting a multi-movie deal with him as namor is probably going to be cheaper than someone like rdj or benedict cumberbatch. I also think namor s new mayan design looks way cooler than comic namor  whose design can literally be boiled down to  man in swimsuit . there s a bit more complexity to namor now  there s a story in his design.
they didn t  ruin  him. they actually did a pretty good job.
I dont think they  ruined   namor . marvel did a great job with him in the movie. never judge a book by its cover.
who s here after namor stole the show and automatically became an s tier character lmaooo
I loved how they gave meaning to the name namor by calling him sin amor  without love  so very well done there
that awkward moment when namor was one of the best characters of a movie full of great characters
although this may not seem like it to you  what they did in the movie for his character was actually pretty amazing. knowing this is a true story from a different culture would make people want to explore more about it. so when you actually think about it  they introduced a culture that not many people knew about but would like to find out about
I quite liked how they portrayed namor and his people. nice meso american adaptation. and the visuals were splendid  so was his backstory and his acolytes   army.
if anyone has seen the movie  and thinks namor isn t a good character and they  ruined  him.. youre wrong
she did not just say   peruvian or something
how is changing his name bad now  I didn t hear anyone complain when they made ghost a woman  when ultron was created by iron man instead of ant man like his comic origin  when fury changed into a black guy  when valkyrie was changed into a black woman  when ego became star Lord s father  when they completely changed the origin of quicksilver and scarlet witch  when they completely changed vultur s origin  when they didn t make zemo a nazI  when mj became just a whole different character  when they changed thanos s motivation for infinity war  when they made marv-ell an old woman  when they changed everything about klaw   what Im trying to make clear is that everyone should at least wait and stfu until the movie is out. if you would complain about every change in the origin of characters then you would have to complain about every other movie.
watched the movie  not everything has to be comic accurate  and the way they presented namor in this movie is perfect in my opinion. I found that they have a good reason to change the namor to aztec  its related to the whole theme
wont lie I loved the change. namor looked straight up bad ass
something to note  changing the story and lore of a character for a movie adaptation does not ruin him. they didn t really change his origin  they just readapted him for modern times. I think that changing his story to make his culture fit into a maya origin actually makes more sense for him being in wakanda. namor to be honest was sort of basic  very 1940s boring superhero. maybe look at it from a different perspective with it being from the mcu  especially given the fact that there is almost no maya rep in movies at all. not to mention tenoch did an absolutely fantastic job with being an intimidating antagonist.
Imissed the part where they  ruined  him
I remember a while back seeing an article thatsaid they discovered underwater pyramids by the caribbean or gulf of mexico which were being linked to possibly being  atlantis . its an interesting take on the character  they have to do something to differentiate namor and aquaman
as a hispanic woman  I couldnt be more excited on how they presented namor into marvel. it was moving   it was beautfiul and it was just so spot on. I loved the movie its a def must watch
thank you  and right ! because he s still  atlantian   but just a more in depth perspective behind who he and his people are. this develops a more derivative and ancient connection from indigenous people to the  atlantian  mythos. or how do you see it I like how the country of wakanda has a very regal royal place in marvel s earth history.

who cares. the movies sucked and the characters sucked.mispronouncing all the sea lingo in world wont change that.
@j jones  your opinion on the quality of the movie is irrelevant. she complained the changing of the namor origin from the source material and the pronunciation of his name  but not even saying  sub-mariner  correctly is a clear sign thatshe is full of crap on caring about source material accuracy.
@joshua avelar  this
@joshua avelar  thank you!!
@j jones  found the simp
@joshua avelar  awesome explanation lol
@j jones  you care bro lol plus dont be a sheep following everyone online just because she hates it dont mean nothing  like who is she our God
@joshua avelar  this
sub mareener is correct
@joshua avelar  we found the woke king
@j jones
1 42 is why she can be criticized for that lol and its just the point thatshe obviously doesnt know or follow this character to she s literally just grifting.
right lmfaoooooo
and then she proceeds to say they made him  peruvian.  when its actually aztec  she s lost in so many ways
cant even pronounce the actors name
@cigamz  judging by your name youre apart of the inclusion problem...
@destrudo  you are brave behind the scenes coward
@cigamz  the channel is open. sound alike someone who wishes he was white. damn shame you kids these days. appreciate your ethnicity an race. lol
@joshua avelar exactly!!! thank you!!!!!
she puts raisins in her potato salad.
it fits so perfectly into native indigenous american culture! its so cool and the main reason why I paid 8 more tickets to take my entire family with me! lmao!  from kulkulkan  the history of how they became blue  talokan and how its artistry with advanced architecture were all connected! I loved it!    she s ignorant af and itshows.
marvel had it what it had been for years and years in the comics for a reason if that was the case they would ve changed it long ago your just chattin and might be a dc fan I personally dont like when movies flip comics and mangas what Ive read to be cannon is changed to ppl who ve never heard of these hero s and characters
I agree  seeing another aquaman look a like  or even reminiscent of it would be so boring. extremely happy with how marvel continues to set themselves apart from the other companies!
Im kind of tired of this weak reasoning. aquaman and namor the sub-mariner have been the same characters in competition for decades. but all of sudden   now  it matters to  separate  them when they were quite different to begin with. stop the cap.
@memory drain  then go make your own namor content. its too bad you cant see what makes this namor special  specially to the people it represents.
@yasmeen w  whatever you say  miss. I find the reasoning  separating themselves from dc  to be weak. I didn t say anything else.
@memory drain  cool  youre allowed to have your opinion.
@miliano zu iga-de anda     my wife and I just got back from mexico. a lot of what we learned about mayans was in the movie. that was an awesome feeling
I agree   I was so into that character
he s trash in the movie hunny bun
they even changed his name
agreed  tenoch huerta did a fantastic job betraying a menacing villain. gorr was a less threatening villian and he s a God butcher!!.
yeah I enjoyed his character. and he s an anti-hero  yielding I think sets up his character for next movies. definitely not ruined  loved every scene with him lol though I feel he s pretty powerful and thought it was funny they dried him up.
welcome to youtube. this was brought to you purely for clicks and relevance
@davyzoombo  no he didn t  he played him like he was in a poorly acted mexican soap opera.
they did ruin him  you shill.
agreed!
ehhh they kinda did wanna equality is the dumbest way
I loved his dad bod. love handles on the side  and just barely shy of looking fat. definitely super hero antI hero material. they should have cast leslie jones or whoopI goldberg to take the role of female black panther. would have been awesome and inspiring to overweight girls everywhere.
have youread namor   no you haven t.  so you wouldn t know.
@john doe  yup exactly.  cheech in a low rider would have been the best namor!
@john doe  dude. for reals   my comment was for the other guy.  smh.
@sonofthebigguy enemyofcornpop  ah  my bad. its late and saw two replies. my brain read them both as responses to me. my apologies. I gotta get some sleep.
@john doe  all good bro
dude  ghost  you dont know what you are talking about .  there are thousands of fans that do not love a latino version of namor.  and the movie underperformed.  that also is proof.   him  is not him.  namor was an atlantean and white.  this movie version  is not anything like the white  proud ruler of atlantis and he did not come from the mayans.
@luke yznaga  get over it .
@memory drain  they really haven t been in competition marvel barely uses namor where as aquaman is  a key staple for dc. also  live action  movies are different  medium in ppls minds aquaman is king of atlantis cause he debut in screen first
@yasmeen w  nah talocan sounds better than atlantis
@jxckthxripper  no youre wrong.  atlantis is better.
@memory drain  thats because comic fans will know the defense but the majority of the movie watchers aren t comic fans. when namor was first rumored to be the antagonist people were all over twitter and here saying he is a aquaman copy cat despite namor being first. the change was a good thing. maybe they could ve kept the name atlantis but we dont know what big screen trade marks dc made behind the scenes with certain names and titles
@miliano zu iga-de anda     I can see that you never read the comics haha
@yasmeen w  the real namor from the comics is wayy better than aquaman
@mac spazzz   nolan didn t follow the comics and his trilogy is still the greatest comic book movies of all time I think your argument is shattered by this fact
@mac spazzz  Imean good thing they changed him I grew up and been familiar with aquaman my whole life I would of jst seen him as aquaman 2.0 despite knowing namor came first
no they ruined him
@the destroyer2alltrolls  I disagree but I see no point in arguing
agreed!
@j.network3232  no
@j.network3232  no he was not hunny bun you need to sit down somewhere
facts
I honestly didnt like rirI williams  I think they could done better for her. namor I thought was solid. I understand it they did appropriate it into the movie it was shaky with the mayan aztec origins but it was ok. Imuch rather this than making characters cough cough female characters strong just for the sake of being female. and I think they couldnt use atlantis because of dc and aquaman.
he is better than the comic version imo.
@comeonbunny  hell no!
isn t namor.  its cool if you like it. its an entirely different character just with the same name.  the submariner is one of my favourite characters of all time.  the anti-hero.  a selfish dickhead who sometimes has to do the right thing.  basically vegita
pretty good job with what  he s a new character just using the namor name.
nah they ruined him
she s right....they ruined namor.
@rickiedees nutz  they made him better!
they totally ruined a character thats been around since the 60s. maybe only little girls named angel or angela...whatever ....will like this version.
if you actually read the comics and aren t just a marvel movie you would know  they ruined namor !
right
they ruined him  he looked chubby and  didn t look menacing at all. they should have had him more built if he is strong as hulk and thor. rirI williams was beyond annoying in this movie  and it was a try hard with her character. having her make that machine as a college experiment in 2 months and building something at 3 years old  lastly the way her character yelled modern teenager attitude was annoying. I liked the movie but definitely was some things that could have been much better
@cant get anymore disappointed  too many marvel shills.
the change was great  a lot of things are changed  m baku was changed killmonger was changed and its all great
naw.. ruined
@nershon kamara  thats pretty much what it is. she s doing the research in real time with the mindset thatshe doesnt like the new backstory.
@j.network3232  he s not really  hunny bun  he was actually a really good actor in the movie tf u talking about
@the destroyer2alltrolls  I disagree with your comment he was actually really good dont see how they  ruined  him
@rickiedees nutz  dude  he s been around since the 30s. get your facts straight.
@joviesha carty  because you ve never read even a single comic book with namor the submariner in it.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  still tho he s not ruined in the movie thats my opinion done talking
fr  I didn t know namor was mexican in the comics thxs for letting me know
@the destroyer2alltrolls  consider me straightened out.
they took a nobody character that only incels who wish they were chads like and made it an actual character.
pretty good  is not good enough for a character like namor.
@j.network3232  no he wasn t hunny
@the destroyer2alltrolls  no they didn t hun
@dr. spidey wartz  no
@j.network3232  what movie are you in hater
the movie was amazing haters!
@narendra dev  awww dont
@the destroyer2alltrolls   hater!
@cigamz  dont want
@joviesha carty  lol
@dominic faison  like literally
an amazing job  on the first mutant. top3 mutant performance we ve seen from marvel   hollywood. some waited 30  years for this  her opinion is
@javier valenzuela  he s not an actual character in the movie  he is just cannon fodder in it.
@luke yznaga  so what if he isn t white  he wouldn t even call himself white in the comics  he doesnt like the surface world. they changed his skin color and backstory  but he s still namor  we were shown the characteristics of the same character. he is the proud ruler of his land and will do anything to protect it  get over it lol.
@mfdanilol  you are not being logical.   ..but he s still...  just because you say that and wish it doesnt make it true.  I didn t say he called himself white in comics.  but he was never a mayan.
@luke yznaga  facts.  these rubes dont even know that namors last name is mckenzie.
all over the internet.  all over many chat rooms and fan pages...where are these people you say that thinks marvel did a great job with him  prove it.  show me  money and fans and stats and diagrams.... but it is just your opinion.  strange.  never heard of you in critic circles.
@luke yznaga  thats why I refuse to call him namor.ramon fits better.this is a whole new character using the name that was originate and created from the comics.
I agree with you kamal
he was terrible. terrible acting and terrible writing for the character thatshould of been much more villainous to carry a movie feeling the absence of its star character.
he s mexican atlantean
@comeonbunny  yeah if a mexican reads the comic
@rickiedees nutz  he s wife called him amor
tacos wont taste the same after watching that movie
right
no they dont  it was an abomination
@akeem porter   I own most of the 60s line and read them incessantly as a child. it was pure cheesy pulp fiction. are we really mourning namor mckenzie   the atlantis that looked like sea monkeys lived their  now I will say the modern namor is a badass especially after civil war.  all the upgrades translate just fine to the mcu version and are improvements. I would love a phoenix force version of mcu namor!
Ive always felt that the changes the mcu made to characters made sense but this is one of the few times I disagree.
@lee b  exactly
@zachary harris  y all severely overestimate how interesting anamorphic was in the comics everything that needed to be portrayed by his character is present just not in the overtop campy comic book sense. in a lot of the runs anamorphic isn t even really a character he s a damn plot device. he s still selfishly devoted to his kingdom everything he does is for them and his rule. his pride isn t as deep because he s actually being a smart villain and king by playing the long game. y all just regurgitating hate and its sad.
@qballa    I apologize for the long winded response. I respect your opinion. as I respect what they tried to do with the character. there s no need to say its sad or hateful.  a difference in opinion in regards to movies is normal.  I just personally found his original back story to be more compelling and iconic.  I generally dont like any character s back stories being changed  unless it is done substantially better or as well. I think the actor did what he could. and I think it is a bit much to say they  ruined  his character.  I just dont think it was a compelling enough portrayal.  if he was as compelling as tom hiddleston as lokI or thanos it would be different.  if something is done well it can be forgiven. even though those portrayals are not 1 for 1 comic accurate we forgive them because of how good they were. maybe he will grow on us as he continews but in this outing it was not enough for me personally. namor is really like a force of nature similar to thor. while he was imposing I did not get the same  weight . I would really recommend the new namor the submariner 2022 run and or his outing in the early avengers run when he fought the hulk.  just to be clear I thought namor was  fine . he was one of the better parts of the film. however  he did not fulfill me as a life long fan of the character.  also while namor the submariner may seem like a goofy character he one of the 1st marvel superheroes and interesting to those who are fans of him.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  agreed  he sounds like any deported la dude  woth pocho cholo bravado and all of that
yeah this is click bait. he was the best character and pretty damn accurate
true
im mexican and this character is obvious woke pandering. I did think was cool visually but his origin was stupid af and would rather they keep the characters as they were originally
@boss media  the original character namor mckenziegiant forehead green speedios pointed earslives in the same atlantis as the sea monkeys vskulkulkan the feathered serpent God this is clearly an improvement.
@lee b  no its stupid. and im mexican. I dont need hollywood to ruin characters just to pander.
@boss media  so your argument is namor mckenzie with the big ass forhead in green underwear is better than namor serpent king you dont have to be mexicanto see the original was corny  and I say that as a fan and collector. post civil war he gets a lot better but visually and lore wise the comic character is inferior to the mcu revision but these are opinions you are entitled to yours  and Im entitled to mine.
@boss media  pandering is when you put one black guy in the movie named tyrone and he dies in the first ten minutes. clearly the world building her was done with an expert in mesoamerican history and culture. you may dislike it I can imagine millions of latinos that watch this movie will be excited to see people that look like them sound like them on the big screen characters of depth and not just a drug dealer or other stereotypical portrayal of latinos in films
@lee b  what s wrong have having pointed ears  and doesnt he still have pointed ears in the movie  the original namor is cool and badass. you people keep using thatsame stupid excuse   speedo  green underwear spock.
@boss media   lol dude has gone full incelkeep at my boy one day you will get a date.
@boss media   they could have made subtle changes so long as they kept him white just spit it out. you simp for whiteness thats ok just be honest.
they did great
@lee b  just because people criticize a character its automatically racist. such a tired stupid argument. in my opinion  they should just create a new character if its going to be so far removed from the original. for the record  I am a minority or  person of color  in woke speak.
@j.network3232  nope
peruvian  thats as far as I am going to go watching this video  this girl is only speaking for speaking s sake  too bad I had to comment  this opinion means nothing
normally I hate when they do this  but in namor s case I liked it because you can differentiate him from aqua man now. they re virtually the same character except namor can fly for some reason.
ruin him
@the destroyer2alltrolls
nope
exaaaccccttttlyy
@big mon
@j.a.g.  they did horrible.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  must not have watched the same movie
@narendra dev  the pronaunciation...that is different
@ivan ca edo  yeah it changes the entire name.
@the destroyer2alltrolls oh yeah definitely canon fodder  not like cannon fodder would take out the queen of wakanda  absolutely shit on the wakandan forces  clobbered the main character multiple times  and he could only be defeated by exploiting his weakness and blowing up an entire ship  which he survives . youre the speaker of truth in this comment section filled with sheep
@hingle mccringleberry  although I agree with you about people who criticize namur aren t all racist  I gotta disagree with everything else. if the character s race truly doesnt matter to what they represent then its not a big deal who plays them as long as they keep the character s core aspects  unless they were characters specifically made to represent minorities to empower them  i.e black panther  and the movie did just that. plus they had to change namor for the general audience so they wont think he s aquaman 2.0. ryan and his team made good use of the changes though  providing us with a unique under city and people thats different from the usual advanced lost underwater city trope where its also used as a plot device.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  hater!
@the destroyer2alltrolls  sit down pinky
@boss media  real talk.  namor was a bastardization of the character.  its a shame.
@cigamz  cry me a river.
@lee b  clearly its not.  go read the comics and try again.
@the destroyer2alltrolls   the invaders capnamorbuckytorchtorounion jack cap britianww2 fought against  hitler the nazis and red skull and the axis of evilu-boat was a cool villain to namorlol
@rickiedees nutz  I think namor is older not sure.
@cant get anymore disappointed  namor   comic books   is built and is strong and handsome and arrogant at times.
@jesse seonza  ummm . okay
dont lie
word. why would they make another aquaman  this was better
thank you... couldn t agree more!!!
@j.network3232  like you
facts
in your opinion  I think his character was horrible.
@charissa  why
@justin sidious  well most people dont give a crap about namor. normal people read aquaman if they want to root for an underwater character. the namor in this movie is great. perfect character to take liberties with. im sick of marvel taking liberties with important characters. do what you want with c list characters like namor. they gave a great back story
so youre saying instead of just making her original character for the mexican people or even the mayan people  if you want to get technical with their history  their culture  even the mythology to make it original to you. you rather they take a character already existed. ariana history has nothing to do with the mexican culture and stuff like that and slap your people on them. like how people think taco bell is a mexican dish. I even made my own original character based off the mayans history. its a female superhero. the whole bases around her is around the mexican culture  mexican people  the history  the lifestyle that we live in the us and Im black. how can a black man do a better job of taking the history of a mexican culture and make it original  superhero for them but disney that has thousands of employees working for them not one single individual can do it.
@sergy casimir  hard to make sense out of that.
they did ruin him. its a completely different character
they didn t ruin him by changing his name or ethnicity. they just made him an idiot.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  gotta bring race. typical  this is the target audience she shoots for and itshows
@pb42189  yup
no they didn t
the only reason I liked the movie
@jo do  he was awsome stop being a sour hater
terrible. they should have cast diego luna instead or keanu reeves.
no they didn t. stop capping
