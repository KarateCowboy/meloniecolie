I played through tomb raider 2013 four times and never once got the impression that lara and sam were romantic or flirty with each other.  they were clearly written as friends.  also  lara wanting to save her best friend from having her mind and body taken over and dieing in a rather painful way is what good people do.  narcissistic and horrible people only see this as  must be lesbians
two female characters have a sisterly bond as friends  slacktivists   le o.m.g. lesbianz!  the sheer toxicity coming from these passive progressive slacktivists is honestly jawdropping at this point.
well we took away lara s feminity  her curves and character. the only thing next is to make her a lesbian.  - gaming urnalists probably.
I find it concerning that a growing amount of people are obsessed with a fictional characters sexuality to the point that it becomes the bedrock of how they relate to them. to be frank  youreally only see this kind of behavior widespread in the lgbt community. Im willing to wager if you ask someone who s straight why they may like a character they ll likely never bring up that its because the character is a heterosexual. what s worse is that this way of thinking is prevalent in the real world and is shown with how this culture has become so overly obsessed with sexuality that its also become the bedrock to many people s core identity. Imay be wrong...but maybe the so called  puritans  that warned about the dangers of the so called  sexual liberation  were right about something.
I got attacked on twitter last year for pointing out this very topic! there s a difference between suggestion and implementation. turning lara gay failed. it never became a thing. its not canon. a lot of gamers gay or straight seem to project themselves onto lara in the most disturbing ways. as if lara is theirs. like they own lara.  Im gay so lara must be gay as well.  its ridiculous. this article made me want to punch my tv.
any time a girl has tendencies like  or is  a tomboy  they always go   she s a lesbian.  kinda like how that one immature high schooler we ve all seen would be like   you like x  what are you gay   but because its all for wokeness  its okay.
Im a game dev  and regarding remasters  they are  updates  to a game in my opinion. you update the graphics  the controls  the camera  add voice acting  if there was none before   but you keep the feel  the story  the characters as they were back in the original. the only thing that Imay consider to add story-wise  is plugging plot holes  but the storyline must remain intact. you dont update the story with the flavor of the month politics or agenda  you stay true to the original work. a remaster is not a remake.
the fact that there can be no platonic same-sex friendships anymore is infuriating. all relationships are essentially reduced to sexual connections  and its disgusting. people just cant stand not to project themselves onto the world and characters. this kind of thing is why I despise the culture of relationship  shipping  in fan communities. just let the story and characters be.
Im so tired of good characters stories being changed to be more woke. it wouldn t surprise me if they did this to lara at this point. I think I agree with shadiversity on why this is happening  the new writers think they are smarter than the original writers and can  improve  the story with their changes  but they aren t. also  imo the good you do by being genuine and expressing yourself outweighs the haters that get angry because you disagree with them. whether by inspiring people to take better care of themselves and go to the gym or by sharing God s word  you are having a positive impact.
2010s  every woman character should be a strong independent woman and need no man.2020s  every woman character should be a lesbian.
I def think you should be a lara croft consultant for the devs  someone needs to preserve her og attitude and aesthetics  not change her for the  times  we live in
game journos do this to every prominent female video game character. you cant have platonic relationships or even good friendships anymore. its important because it pushes the narrative.
they re hardly even journos in gaming anymore. just wannabe activists.
these activists dont care about the characters  they re just keeping score on how many characters they can claim.
if some bright-minded people want to change something about a character  know this that they dont care about the character but only care about its ip  value. for us the characters we play  we read  we see are real. we know who they are at their core. we get to see their inner selves. and if a character has different iterations  it exists to tell new adventures not to say it changed its sexuality  skin tone  nationality or religion. we care about them because we feel what they feel no matter who they are  we have something called empathy and we only value their personality and how good of a person they are or not and thanks to our love and care they have their value in the first place. you can make a female gandalf  a bixesual luke  a dude ripley  a white blade or anything but the majority of people wont care about the  new  version. you cant have a new version of somebody and if you want to have that  it means you value everything else except the character s personality. then you probably do this in real world too and thats why human race is more divided than ever without even fighting the great wars like we did before.people keep lying about how they want to have rich culture and representation but they were ready yesterday to change the others and dictate their own image. hypocracy at its highest.
I really enjoyed the classic games because it really made you feel like you were alone. lara didn t have radios  buddies at her side or relationships to build with that drama. I remember triI s beginning  it was my intro to the series  just leaving you at the great wall  the music kicks in and you get this sense of being all alone and it was eerie yet calming at the same time. lara was cold  calculating  fascinating  a badass and you knew there was nothing she couldn t handle  until she comes across the t-rex lol . she had an alluring personality that pulled you in and made you want her to succeed even when she did something wrong. a lesbian relationship  let alone any relationship for lara is just retarded.
I actually cant picture lara croft in a romantic relationship with someone.
I encountered someone on redditsaying thatshe was a lesbian in their head cannon  to which I encountered with lara giving alex a kiss on the cheek when he sacrifices himself in tomb raider 2013  because she knew he had a crush on her. I know it wasn t intimate  but still. also  in the same game  its mentioned in one of the documents journal entries you can find that her and sam went to the club and she talked about guys checking her out and how she wasn t interested in dating. its been a few years  so this could be a bit off. also  I think they specified that her and sam were best friends. it can be so annoying when people try to add stuff to a character that isn t there.
lara doesnt really show any romantic attachment to anyone in any game  even the reboot games if I remember right. she has friends and people she cares about  but never a relationship. she knows she s attractive and uses it to get what she wants  but its strictly business.lara s sexuality doesnt matter because it is one of the last things relevant to the story.making lara s sexuality a focal point is like making a kaiju movie and thinking viewers want to see more scenes only involving the human characters. no one is there for that.
when your life is so difficult you get to question a fictional characters sexuality you might need to go touch grass or talk to a normal person. they went this route with the last of us2 and it played out well .oh wait. it killed the franchise. I am sick of this nonsense. they need to create their own characters if they want to normalize this. side note  easter is next week.
true. in this iteration of lara croft I only perceived sam as lara s bestie. why does everything have to be gay now  as if sexuality should solely define the sum of a person s existence  it does not. people scream  inclusion  but its become so ridiculous it has evolved into social regression.
old lara flirted with everyone though  similar to james bond. charming  in control  confident  and unimaginably desirable to the point that they re almost flirting with us mere mortals when they talk to us.
@special edy  bond isn t into men.
the  they saved their life therefore they want to bang them  argument makes me honestly question if these people have ever had a genuine friend in their entire lives. you d have to be really terrible to not care if one of your close friends was going to die and you had the power to save them.
@jonathan watson  pretty sure they dont.
shaz modeus well  none of those people ever had a friend  so they have no fucking clue whatsoever about how a friendship really is.
I saw sam as a little sister kind of friend.
same. same and lara are awesome friends.  this proves this statement alot bout what society thinks   a girl does something nice for another girl cause they are friendssociety   oh mah gawd  they are lesbians!
its like the derangement that leads people to being obsessed over frodo and sam being gay  instead of two close friends who walked into hell together to save their home and friends.the twisted desire to sexualize everything  including friendship  speaks volumes about these people and their depraved souls.
the 90 s called  they want their drunken fratboys back.
good thing parks and rec already ended  they would have totally pushed anne and leslie.
@joshua h  that is the real issue  nowadays everything has to be sexualized. the instant a pairing has a strong bond  be it fictional or even in real life  people assume there must be physical attraction involved. because of this other important bonds like brother sister  parent child  or simply being best friends suffer because of thatstigma.
@tkdboy1889  that man and woman are friendly.  they gonna bang.those women are friendly. they gonna bang.those men are friendly. they gonna bang. dean   they do know we re brothers right  sam   doesnt seem to matter. supernatural s4e18
yup.
@zippity zop  yeah  you probably need to watch skyfall again  bruh.
they didn t. square enix looked at the previous game sales and said  something s not working .
@backup368  never underestimate the power of coward and stupid people in video game companies.
woke fatigue is real
with an extra 40 lbs and blue hair.
and then  when she has become such a boring character and no one will like her as a character anymore   they will say the fans are anti-lgbt and blame them !  woke  people  logic 101
nope the only thing left is to make  her  trans
@kingslayer  shhh dont give them ideas
I wouldn t mind a lesbian lara  as long as she still feminine
everything has to be gay  gay  gay
youre not wrong on one point  most straight people dont need to bring up their favourite characters being hetro because... thats generally considered the default. Im all for challenging that default.I dont see that many people obsessed with characters sexuality any more than straight people are  but queer audiences are pretty attuned to having to do the whole queer reading thing because for so long those sexualities have only existed in those grey spaces. it does lead to a bit of a weird dissonance in over-reading into stories sometimes  however. but who cares
so far everything they predicted is coming true.
slippery slopes are  it turns out  slippery. hoo da thunkit
its not the sexual orientation thats important. fleshing out a character with personal traits makes their journey more immersive. their life matters more if there is depth to them  causing the player to care more about the character and by extension  the experience of the journey.
@sanguinaryblade   I d argue its fairly normal and acceptable for them to consider it the default because being straight by definition is the norm  they are and will always be the majority. as for  who cares   the person who wrote this article seems to  on top of the various shipping fandoms out there that cling and demand lgbt relationships. and I d say when companies start trying to virtue signal by using sexuality  its reasonable for people to speak out because its another form of manipulation and using marginalized people for capital and societal gains. not to mention they often use established characters to try and push that agenda  which hasn t ended well.
one of the many reasons I was disillusioned with  the gay community  in the past was their absolute obsession with talking about being gay. it was soooooo boring and stupid  and I hated every minute of it. I ducked out in the mid-90s  when Imoved to the east village in nyc and was horrified at the conformity and constant  gay gay gay  talk... there were many other valid reasons  but that was the most annoying thing. everyone kind of morphed into one of the three or four expected stereotypes as they entered  the community . the psychodynamics of the obsession with  turning  straight characters is another conversation altogether  but the basic obsession with  gayness  is typical  tbh.
@desert wolfskin  couldn t agree more.
thats a product of society more than anything. we ve allowed people to think that they re these characters represent them when they dont. the media has made it that much worse with the whole shipping culture of characters. because sometimes the studios act on it and single handedly destroy their own characters for brownie points.
dude  dont punch your tv  punch a pillow or the couch. dont hurt the innocent tv. lol.
@joseph michaels  the adventurous joe    maybe the tv keeps giving the evil eye and deserves it !
how s your hand little man
@joseph michaels  the adventurous joe   yeah   at least wait  til melanie gets off the screen before you punch it.
@backup368  this isn t true. square enix considered all 3 reboot tr games  failures.  because they didn t meet expectations. the square enix president even left because 2013 did that bad to them. never trust what they would say  something isn t working . square enix has ridiculous standards in terms of sales
@backup368  also before the reboot  tomb raider has held the record of best selling video game franchise with a female lead since the late 90 s. so tomb raider always does fine with sales.
@ladylaracroft96  really  what sales figures are you looking at
@mrbust  zzzzzzzzz
@backup368  well  technically  something was working  but corporate wasn t seeing what they wanted to see. tomb raider wasn t the hip  edgy series anymore that would sell without changing the basic formula much. all games go through this. all media in general goes through this. I for one dont think the rebranding was necessary  though.
@backup368  look up guinness book of world records! tomb raider holds the record their  it was last updated on october 2021  since then tomb raider is now up to 88 million units world record! this is incredibly simple to find as the numbers are always been released for fans to see   ! hope this helps
@backup368  also in terms of reboot numbers  each game coast either 100 or 100  million to make the profit for the reboot games is basically no existent so they ultimately had to sell tomb raider to embracer group since from square enix s charts the reboots were failures. the reason why the older games were considered success was because the budget was no where near that insane.
@ladylaracroft96  even if tr  2013  sold for just  15 right at the start  the game still would have generated more than double its budget. you d think that if the budget were a problem then square enix would umm...I dunno...lower it  you dont know what youre talking about.
@ladylaracroft96  no  Im talking about the cartoonish iteration that youre implying is more successful than the newer iteration.
@desert wolfskin  a majority at this point in time  sure  but I dont think thats always gonna be the case. its pretty impossible to judge sexuality in a vacuum  but I d not at all be surprised if some degree of bisexuality would be the most common completely removed from most societial pressures. but  maybe thats just my bias and bias is impossible to remove entirely.but yeah  rainbow capitalism sucks just as much as all other forms of capitalism.however in this case  its using an established character who s sexuality has never been a focus  so... yeah. sure. Im fine with lara being a lesbian.that being said  I d rather none of her sexuality become a thing be of any importance in the games  and I think even any sort of reference to it would detract from what most people like most about the fundamentals of lara croft.
it was never about equality  it was all about power and control.
@sanguinaryblade  because alphabet people are the minority
@sanguinaryblade  how about this leave fan fiction out of the games. Im not cool with any devs confirming lara croft being a lesbian at all because it would prove nothing but woke status point to an already a franchise that has been slowly taken over by people pushing their idealology into every aspect of tomb raider. let s leave lara croft to her tomb raiding and doing what she loves most
@graveraider  I agree  lara having any romantic interests detracts from the heart of the story. I personally tend to think of her as aromantic anyway  since she s never shown any inclination besides a mildly playful flirty line here or there.
@sanguinaryblade  she just doesnt need any talk around her sexuality at all because thats not what makes lara croft her.
@the virgin marty  maybe you want to be playing rpgs  dude. tomb raider has over time incorporated more story  but thats only the result of pushing the franchise beyond its original scope in order to keep driving sales. the original few tr games had scant story  by design.
@thom ervin  the original games were limited by weak technology. the audio was so compressed that the dialogue on the disc sounded like crap.they couldn t implement modern stories on those old consoles.we re seeing a trend in modern games where cut scenes blend with gameplay instead of interrupting it.
queer representation isn t  wokeness
wishing for a remaster of the original tomb raider games  keeping the difficulty levels intact - you mentioned camera angles   controls   I bet it d be brutal to go back and play many of the older games for those two things alone!
@wayward l80  yes  what we call the  3cs   character  camera  controls  were often atrocious  at worst  or awkward  at best  back in the late 90s early 2000s.
remember the Lord of the rings with sam and frodo  one of the best examples of friendship and fellowship in the history of storytelling. if the trilogy came out today  the movies would get soooo much flak
there was a cs lewis quote about this. it was something like if you can only see sex in a relationship  you ve never had real friend.
@lark88   those who cannot conceive friendship as a substantive love but only as a disguise or elaboration of eros betray the fact that they have never had a friend.
@thatharvguy  thats the one  thanks.
its why I decided to write my own story. I ll tell you creating new is very difficult.
I dont even consider the reboots to be the real lara croft tomb raider  since they were just woke androgynous blueprints to get the masses on their site and to make sure transistion shock wasnt to big. cause sadly in 2012 13 they received a lot of support from the masses who didnt regconized the thread they posed  thought gamers were weird  cause gaming wasnt mainstream back than   hell even a lot of gamers supported them. in the hope thatsacreficing lara croft tomb raider they wouldnt go after other ip s   and it had the opposite effect. its wa the franchise they used to establish a beach head in gaming  and also gave them the confidence to push it further. I remember how even they were surprised how easy the masses and a lot of gamers turned onto the lara croft tomb raider fan community. I dont even if you witnessed it  but I thought it was so surreal how all that went down.
I feel this is very obvious. these ppl ego are way over inflated. they want the story to be theirs. so when you say their name in the credits  its their lara croft. all ppl have to do  is not buy it day one. no matter the good or bad. just wait. wait for reviews from a few sources. I wait for at minimum 2k reviews on steam  and gameplay videos before I buy. this way I do not fuel this mess.
@irritatingtruth  funny Ive stopped preordering games no matter which title or dev. saved a lot of money from buying full priced betas.
Im not against lgbt even though Im literally a straight person. but imagine you were force to accept the changes of something you hold deary and known for a long time. like  what s the problem if Im straight  you offended by my preferences and should just accept your opinions   like bruh  if you want to be a gay or lesb I dont mind do whatever you want just dont think you gonna change my mindset to your own. if lara was already set fixed from her original characteristic thats just the way she is  a badass archaeologist and not some disturbing lovemaking 18  stuff. if the lgbt want their own lara then  thye should make their own new character from ground up and not using the same name.for example  mcdonalds were famous with their chicken mcnugget and cheeseburger but suddenly someone woke changed the food menu into chicken drumsticks or spaghettI like...arrrghh it just doesnt make any sense. sorry for my bad english.
dont you worry  crystal dynamics recently announced tomb raider 4 on unreal engine 5. they dont have a single concept art or gameplay just yet  but Im betting all my savings the first thing they announce is lara s new gay relationship with whoever.
2030s  every woman character should be able to breed with other woman.
@benice108  2040s  earth women are going extinct because men moved to mars.  and we took the non-woke  intelligent women with us
@vladimir chernikov  sadly its men going extinct realistically.
@jubeI yagami  nonsense
seeing all of media s track record this past decade  I think they actively hire people who aren t fans of x product to make said product. they prefer making something thats nothing like the source material  halo  wheel of time  than let it come out as too fan service-ish. ...then again the mandalorian is too fan service ish  and thatstill sucks. but I think for shows like it  they just go through a list of things that make people go   remember x    shallow fan service  while keeping the bad writing.
funny thing is  you cant seem have a stable marriage in stories either. if there is a stable marriage  someone s gonna die.
thats journalists everywhere now itseems.
thank you! I example  what if your friend in real life swapped names with somebody and that new person took over their life. they wouldn t be the same person  but youre expected to treat them as such  thats what they re doing with characters. just selling us the name and general theme. its heartbreaking.
yes  exactly. the originals made you feel isolated and alone  and it was great. very little music  very little story.
the old school comics were pushing the romantic relationship thing and was cringe. in fact  most times when the comics fleshed out her character it was cringe. I dont think she should be fleshed out. she s a video game character in a game about exploration  puzzle-solving  and shooting shit. tomb raider isn t an rpg.
the only boyfriend option for her I see is kurtis trent but romance does not fit lara croft tomb raider
I would actually say them killing joel and then having to play as his killer killed the franchise. ellie being gay wasn t even a thing in the first game till the dlc dropped that no one played except for the hardcore fans.
@vampireslayer83  it was easy to overlook the ellie angle bc she at least had character development. this issue was they went so hard in on abby a character no one cared for and that killed the franchise imo.
@mr30below  Im honestly not the person you should be having a conversation about character development with on thatseries. I hate joel as a character and found ellie annoying more than endearing most of the time. Im only pointing out the fact that they didn t make her a lesbian till the dlc came out.
I actually enjoyed abby s part of the game more than ellie s. I really dont get all hate towards her.joel left a boatload of bodies wherever he went. then ellie did the same thing.someone was bound to come after joel sooner or later. dude was a freakin killing machine.as for the lesbian stuff. it was literally unnecessary  and mostly felt like it was only added for some extra drama bs.
@glitch  youre a rarity. most people hated abby. abby would have been fine had they not made her out to be the villian right away and then attempted to make her sympathetic with her own story. its like you were playing two different games. plus the ending wasn t very satisfying. ellie should have killed her. otherwise  what was the point of the whole journey. she should have told tommy she wasn t interested when he visited. it was dumb.
@glitch  they sacrificed an entire incredible story to push a boring woke narrative. everything that made the last of us amazing was ripped out of the game in the first few hours and replaced by a transgender character no one cared for or asked for.
@glitch  joel left a boatload of dead people doing the right thing  survival and to protect the one person he really cared about since his daughter sarah  died at the hands of a cruel world. in a more cruel world  wouldnt you think he would fight harder for someone he loves like his own daughter
@vampireslayer83  Imean the her being gay was character development and explains the knife she has. did you know she killed riley with that knife when she turned  inspecting the knife has dried blood  unrealistically. but the blood belongs to riley.
@mr30below  I wonder if thats why people hate abby so much  they think druckmann spit in fans faces by having a transgender kill joel  I personally dont believe she was trans  since lily lev already was . but yeah  knowing druckmann it d be hard to believe he would pass up the opportunity to not make her trans too.
Im convinced most people didn t even read the dark horse comics that tie each game to each other  sam and lara dont even talk anymore. and even if they did  I dont understand why characters have to be tied down by their sexuality  as if its a core personality trait.
Ive read the in-between comics. lara leaves sam to rot in a mental health institution  because she s still partially possessed by the sun queen. totally something you would do to someone youre romantically attracted to. if lara was really attracted to sam  then why does she barely come up in the sequel games  I think lara talks to jonah once about sam and thats it.
thanks for being a positive voice in the video game space. too many seem to just find and point out the negative.and  sharing a verse  with personal commentary  at the end of your videos is so welcome. happy to see people share their faith openly and regularly.
the friendship of sam and lara was actually continue in the comic and fell apart from the trumatic experience of the first events. sam is arrested for assault  but   like her earlier episodes   she cant remember anything about the incident  and due to her violent behavior while being arrested  her bail is denied. she refuses to speak to lara in prison after lara admits thatshe might be going away  screaming at her to go.
classic lara always struck me as the type who wouldn t be satisfied in a relationship.she s happiest at death s door with sharp teeth whooshing past her face and tinnitus ringing in her ears. I can maybe imagine her going basic instinct  but can youreally picture her lying back and thinking of england
perfectly summed up my feelings. seriously. at 37 now  when I was a kid I was the target demographic for tomb raider. it was the very first ps1 game I ever played  fell in love with it and played every single game in the series after that  major games  I never played the gba spin-offs . yes  I grumbled about the pointlessness of chronicles and the clumsy handling of aod  but I still enjoyed them. I even initially loved the reboot! I played it through three times  guiltily enjoying how uncharted had influenced the gameplay.but I have never finished rise  despite over thirty hours of trying repeatedly. Ive never even started shadow despite owning it in its entirety on xbox and pc  those holiday sales  what can you do  .this lara simply is not lara croft. you are the only person I have heard who looks at lara exactly as I did  she s an anti-hero. she s suave  cocky  self-assured  violent  narcissistic and fun. she s not someone to be idolized or romanticized  but to be taken as an 80 s action movie character  so you can enjoy her exploits. she kills lions and tigers and bears on the way to collecting jewels and trinkets for pete s sake. she killed other hunters like luke and pierre who got in her way.this new lara is a soggy muffin. she s extraordinarily dull. og lara had a personality. nathan drake  since they wanted to ape so much of uncharted  had a personality. new lara has tears and a worn-out  dull-eyed expression of grim determination. there is no joy in playing through her stories. I honestly do not care if they make her a lesbian. she s not lara croft  she s lara croft at home. she s a non-fat  gluten-free  health conscious granola alternative with all the life and joy and flavor sucked out of it.
raz rfist@raz0rfist jun 10  2019 all I hope is that they announce lara croft is gay. -actual quote from a  journalist  on the gamespot e3 stream just nowyeah  precious.thatseems infinitely more important than showing new games at a show thats had nothing but dlc and dev updates thus far.
she shouldn t be pursuing sexual interests anyways  its weak and grounded  which lara is neither. she s too far above the level of us mere mortal men and women. not getting romantically or sexually entangled only makes her more attractive as well  and it makes her motivations nuanced and interesting.the second tomb raider movie toyed with the idea of her being in a relationship with gerard butler s character  and everyone hated it. the first tomb raider movie had lara emphatic and cool enough to lightly flirt with daniel craig  but she was too good for even the man who d become james bond to get involved.
I always found that the lara croft comics  there were a lot of male writers putting some male self inserts to fantasise about being in a relationship with her and them being overly flirtatious. now its just the same thing but on the other side. I always found it weird because I always saw lara as unobtainable too.
honestly this is just more proof they want everyone to be gay.there are so many gay characters in video games these days but because another popular character is being talked about  suddenly that character also has to be gay.never mind all the others  nothing can be straight or even just not discussed.it all has to be gay.
I love your content  melonie! it took courage to start speaking your mind publicly even though doing so could have alienated your established followers. I also really love the daily scripture verses. keep it up
I definitely agree thatshe is largely focused on her adventures.  flirty and brazen. relationships would only hold her down
lara always struck me as a character who has been there and done that  and found it to be less thrilling than her actual job. she isn t a milksop or a whiny woman. she doesnt spend 10 hours of every day on twitter  or insta. she isn t trying to pine over a lost love  or making excuses for terrible behavior in relationships. she s an adult  through and through. so much so thatshe is an ideal version of an adult strong woman.a girlfriend is fucking fanfiction. it is there simply to be subversive. this is a terrible idea  but that wont stop the woke morons. it never does.
I picture lara croft as a young woman who is very happily single  loves going on adventures  working out  loves her alone time  etc. she is by far one of the most independent characters out there  she doesnt need a romance. she is perfect the way she is. as a sidenote  lara would be childfree her whole life too. lara would never ever want any kids. I know one of the lead staff members at crystal dynamics mentioned in an interview years ago the possibility of lara having kids in a future game  and I definitely do not like that idea at all. lara having kid s  wouldn t go over well for the fan base and would not make sense for the franchise to go in that direction. I love lara being her independent  adventurous self.
I just finished my replay of the 2013 reboot. if sam and lara were a couple  then why did alex think he had a shot with lara
I feel like the loonies would try to bypass not care justify the  damsel in distress  thing purely because its a woman rescuing a woman  because  screw men they re horrible  but its fine if we do it  kind of logic.loving this channel btw
love the content! recently subscribed and it makes me happy to see another sensible gamer!!
I actually went back and played the legend trilogy  to be honest  I really like that lara  she s snarky  powerful  beautiful and competent  but also has her own emotional struggles  even if not completely relatable to normal people. she feels complete  and although the games  in my opinion  dont feel as fun as the original ones  anniversary is definitely up there in my list. underworld just feels and plays weird  its where lara started feeling  heavy  and the jumps  man... the way the game corrects the jumps is so  so weird...either way  I long for a world where aod was good and got its deserved trilogy  would buy in an instant.
the same people who misconstrue lara and sam s friendship are the same people that misconstrue boys playing with dolls as wanting to be trans.
well  no  people generally dont read the comics.
exactly. she s like bayonetta  unapologetically daring and sexy  but still charming and lovable. she s playful around men  banters with them  and maybe even shows vulnerability around them  but she s not some misandrist man-hater. they re both characters that have full agency of their femininity and sexuality.
being sexually interested in another human being is  weak   like wut  lol.
@shiny slappy people  its simple and basic  normal people are driven by love  lust  and romantic sexual desire  but lara is not supposed to be normal.barret xill in the comment above used a good word  vulnerable. romantic or sexual interests would make lara vulnerable  but she is very much the opposite of vulnerable.
@special edy  yeah uh that is the dumbest  neo puritan  antI sex  antI human  and craziest take ever. impressive  I guess.
@shiny slappy people   I think its like making superman vulnerable to bullets. not hating on human  just that the main attractiveness of lara is thatshe is the bayonetta type of character that doesnt need to be in a relationship. if she does get to a relationship  her partner need to be on a the same level of design and development to her to make it work. which is near impossible.
I just watched luca over the weekend and the crazies on the left insisted that luca and alberto had to be gay. all I saw in the movie was two boys who became best friends because of a shared love of vespa scooters and wanting to see the world. it is a real head scratcher as to why same sex friendships just cant be a thing at all anymore in their eyes.
Ive often considered lara to be asexual as well. its rather ironic that this article goes out of their way to try to force in lgbtqa  representation when they already have it. and in a type of person that often gets little representation anyway.
2 woman stand near each othergame journos  look at those lesbians!!!!!!
the only instance we ever got of lara s  love life  was in the og tomb raider from 1996 and that was an arranged marriage and the plane crashed and her fianc  died  basically lara croft doesnt want to marry or have those types of relationships cuz she wants to solely focus on archaeology and her real live is in digging up the past and also in a cut ending for shadow of the tomb raider which you can still access if you delete the day one patch update itshows that lara received a letter from natla and plus as of now sam is in a mental institution after the events that happened on the island.
next week is easter weekend
I love the journo sagas. keep dunking  mac
lara croft is one of the most defining heroines in gaming history  so imagine the impact she would have by coming out as lesbian. this is grooming.
its grooming on the larger scale.  our response to this type of stuff just needs to be  ok groomer.
as a gay person  I dont want lara to be a lesbian and the reasons for why this writer wants lara to be queer are completely selfish and stupid. I dont think of relationships when I think of lara. no romance whatsoever please. I am okay with people shipping and fan fiction  thats totally fine and thats where itshould stay at. also I agree with what you said about tall women. lady dimitrescu is a recent example of how much people love tall women.
I dont care if she likes girls too  but damn  dont crush the dreams of 90 s boys everywhere ya loons! I really hate forced lore changes to iconic characters  fictional or not! thanks melonie  keep up the good work!!
I am seriously scared now...I dont want these psychos to destroy lara. she is my favorite character .besides  they are such hypocrites. cant lara have a friend  in these journous words   cant a woman be written as having a friend  does she always have to be involved in romantic relationships  I dont play tr for the drama. one of the reasons why I enjoyed this series so much  especially the original games   was the fact that there are no romantic relationships whatsoever. its just an adventure for the sake of being an adventure.
always great to get a good  old fashioned  tomb raider rant from you  melonie! yeah  Im with you in that Im no fan of the character revisionism going on these days. people are taking other artist s and writer s work and trying to jam new character traits into them for the purpose of being woke and  in the process  making the character completely unrecognizable. why not just make a new character  I already know the answer  because that new character doesnt have an already established fan base willing to pay them for new content  plus they wont be able to call us sexist  racist  homophobic  or whatever for wanting the characters we love to be who they were originally designed to be!like you  I have no problem with characters of any race or sexual orientation  and like you said  its insulting that people think that new characters that aren t straight or white cant possibly stand on their own. they think the only way people will accept diverse characters is if they make already beloved straight or white characters diverse. obviously they dont think very highly of their audience.also I agree with you 100  about not liking the first two recent spider-man movies  but really liking the new one.thank you  also  for the encouraging verse of the day and your thoughts on it. I was feeling down because someone didn t want to be my friend because Im a Christian  but you bringing up that verse  and talking about our calling as Christians  helped.   and youre right about original lara being selfish. Imean  who else but lara would lock her own butler in a freezer  Imean  seriously!
lets normalize platonic love again. not everything has to be romantic.
never change the ending song it fits you perfectly
the gaming journos will never quit...
yeah the reboot was pretty weird in the sense that lara just got done massacring dozens of soldiers  then breaks down and cries  then proceeds to raid a tomb and kill more soldiers  rinse repeat. I did like those games for what they were though  the tombs were some of the best puzzles and the atmosphere of them were all spectacular.
I dont know if this is the writer s purpose  but I think turning lara gay would be used as a way to exclude men from the fandom. it would be like  lara s gay now! you  men  cant have her anymore!  it would also be used as a weapon by telling men that if they dont like gay lara  they re homophobic. its all stupid ways of thinking  but I can see that coming. side note  turning all strong women gay  also reinforces so many stupid stereotypes.
I never thought about it  but I like the idea that lara croft doesnt have a love interest. a lot of male heroes did not have a love interest. this ranges from classic martial arts movies to sci-fImovies to video games. they never get the girl. so its nice to not force a love interest on a woman  especially since its not the focal point of the game.
I swear if she s in any type of romantic relationship Im not playing this game. for those who want a relationship to happen I seriously think thats all you guys care about.
literal conversion to characters who cant fight back. and  I could be wrong  but wasn t this series  the reboot lara  a separate timeline thing oh  yes  the multimillionaire heiress is going to settle down in a tiny little cottage  as though she would know what to do with herself stuck in the house with... sam  right.
and I will be sunning in palm springs on my first vacation in my 50 years of life.
palm sunday is tomorrow april 10th
...nah its really not.
@sanguinaryblade  the stated goal is to use her popularity to influence people.
@mitch ryan  thats not what grooming is.
technically that kinda is grooming.
@princeofqrow  how so  I really dont see the connection between seeing a lesbian character and grooming a child towards anything sexual.
@sanguinaryblade  teenagers.
my reply to sanguine keeps getting deleted.
@mitch ryan  he must not have any strong case against grooming.
@princeofqrow  so by your own definition every hetrosexuak character is grooming then
@second form paul  no.
spot on.
nathan drake settling down with elena fisher and still going on adventures makes sense. lara croft doing this just seems wrong  I liked how they made her death more brutal in the reboot  but she is definitely not who was originally. the movie was even less based on the game  so it continued to feel less  tomb raider  than angelina jolie did.
gaming journalist are the absolute worst. lara was never into having a relationship with anyone but I did love the teamwork between her and kurtis trent in aod.
there is also a book set after  the frist reboot game where sam ends there friendship after the events of yamatI and laura accepts this. as she is so focused on uncovering the truth about trinity
is it just me  or did these articles from journalist see more like threats to the developer of how they should make their games instead of just merely being an opinion piece
nothing can be just a plain old good story anymore  gotta wokeify every thing. sad world we live in
I d like to see the new tomb raider go back to the lonely exploration of exotic locations and maybe iterate on the hub and interaction aspects of angel of darkness. I honestly quitshadow of the tomb raider because at one point there was a puzzle where lara would ask jonah for a hint  and when I got it wrong  she d ask again  and again. it got so grating  I couldn t focus on how to actually solve the thing.I guess my point would be to have tombs and interactions be mutually exclusive. no time for talking  only raiding.
to me the character works best without romance in-game. so agree with you there. not necessary for any fictional lead character to be in a romantic situation - thats a very hollywood american presumption in fiction. always tended to be a formula in hollywood for commercial reasons  and that influence has run deep in entertainment for many decades. Im also not keen on  realism  in story-based games - games are at their best when they re just crazy fun  beyond realism  such as tr1-3 on ps1  to be in an interactive world unlike ours with a larger-than-life character
to be honest I d like to see a compilation of the old and new trilogy to sum it all up in one big package
the people writing these articles wouldn t be able to hold a fraction of the conversation or understanding you can about this character. its a shame studios dont have the guts to just make new ip instead of jimmy rigging their ideologies into the success of already defined characters. we re seeing it everywhere and its such a lame move.
here s a lore deep cut from someone who s actually played these specific tomb raider games  I distinctly remember that there was a collectable in the second tomb raider game thatstated thatsam was so traumatized by the events of the first game  because who wouldn t be if they were in her position   thatshe was put into a mental hospital. pretty sure I am remembering that correctly.
lara croft is a lesbian.  projection
at the time it never mattered to me. now that I think about it a bit itstill doesnt matter to me in the way these people think it matters. now if I were to  give  an intrested I d be ok with bysexual intrested since the thrill us what she actually wants. nothing serious either. these types of people tend to stay single with a few partners from time to time.
this is what happens when you hand the reins to toxic shipper activists. probably because they re missing that connection from their own love life  so they project that onto fictional characters as a self-insert proxy.
is anyone really shocked about this sort of thing anymore they wont stop till everything is ruined
to quote frodo in the return of the king   the shadow that bred them can only mock  it cannot make  not real new things of its own. the author stated in the article  imagine if this well established character came out was turned into a  insert minority group   they cant come up with good characters nor stories  so they turn to existing characters just so they can leach off their names. its not like you cant have a game staring an adventurous lesbian  but every time they do this it comes out as shoddy and lazy  for the sake of  representation   which is also questionable because do youreally need all that representation for what is statically a small portion of the population  but thats another tangent...
make lara croft great again
Ive got this amazing idea. why doesnt someone come up with an original character who is gay. write up a well thought out back story showing their strengths  weaknesses and desires. oh right. of course. you need talent to do that
I completely forgot about joanna dark until that comment came up - when she burst on the scene back in 1998  she was perfect as she was! all thanks to rare - back when they were good!by the way  I love your Bible verse of the day segments! who says your faith has to be limited to what you do on a sunday
we all know exactly who we want lara croft to chase -- a giant freakin  t-rex.  d
despite future the outcome  for crystal dynamics  new tomb raider  unreal engine 5 presents a perfect opportunity. indie devs will have a chance to compete against aaa on an engine that is free for anyone to use. we can now show crystal what we fans think lara should be. all we need is a game programmer and maybe someone who can get mel to do some motion capture recording and someone to do the voice acting  no offense mel  I bruise easy  jokes aside I think this is absolutely achievable  and this is coming from an independent 3d artist.
I always imagined lara being asexual.she is in love with travelling  relics   history !
yes  the comics cover it
actually  its more like assertion  one of six tools of pr   g nda - along with repetition  emphasis  and lying  if I remember my studies of animal farm
I was waiting for this topic. youre awsome melonie.
people  shipped  lara and sam for years after game back in 2013 came out. I know cause I was on tumblr around that time. but I agree they were just close friends.
the journos are at it again   deep sigh
I like hearing about your passion towards lara croft it reminds me when I talk about final fantasy
hell   if it means we ll get a hot girl-on-girl sex scene   Im all for it!
tomb raider talk starts at 0 00 - thanks melonie
what is this weird obsession with lara being ordinary! she isn t an ordinary woman who should never settle for an ordinary life. its the worse thing they could do with her character. anyone who wants her to settle down  have kids and be a housewife doesnt understand the character at all!!! the thought makes my stomach churn. smh
tomb raider needs to hurt up and give lara croft a girlfriend already  its titles like these that lose me immediately.
when woke lara isn t woke enough.
lara croft is asexual  no  definitely not. make no mistake  I think we can all agree that lara is a fiercely independent woman  and thatshe is neither sentimental  nor actively seeking romance  and that this part of her personal life is probably beyond the scope of the series. but none of this indicates asexuality.core s lara very much enjoyed being a woman when she had the opportunity. she was playful  even sensuous  while remaining classy. she flirted with and subtly teased a few people with whom she obviously would never have a tryst  like larson  von croy  and even the player. in aod  lara is also obviously attracted to kurtis  even though the story ends before we can find out if their attraction will ever go anywhere. I enjoyed this  since it made her more human to me. so she was at least capable of entertaining such thoughts in her imagination. one thing she was not was a frigid  asexual academic ice queen.even angelina jolie understood this. the films were mediocre  of course  but they at least got the tone of lara s character right. the relationships in those films were more or less what I imagined she would have had. both tomb raider movies and the comics involved lara in plots in which she had to work with and against former lovers of hers who now lusted after the same artifacts she pursued  and while none of these were canonical to the games  none of it would have been out of character for core s lara.crystals  lara seems too frigid and self-obsessed for me  and reboot lara seems to fit the stereotype of an overly serious academic type who cant learn to have fun. both have been re-imagined as hermione granger agent scully types obsessed with the  quest for truth  rather than the  thrill of the adventure  as per classic lara. either of them could very well be asexual  but lara is now being written into a time where everyone is too obsessed with identity politics for any thought of sex or romance not to explode over the fandom like an unwelcome warhead over d.c.the literary and cinematic inspirations for lara croft--conan the cimmerian  jules de grandin  buck rogers  doc savage  james bond  and indiana jones--all got laid pretty often. all of them undoubtedly broke hearts every now and then. all of them were  mad  bad  and dangerous to know . lara croft is very much a part of this grand pulp hero tradition  except she is female. sex and romance were as much a part of the pulp adventures as danger  mystery  and exoticism  even if only subliminally. core seemed to understand this in ways that crystal and cd did not.and its interesting that one should mention lara s immaturity  because I think thats an important factor  too. michael moorcock  in his criticism of robert e. howard s characters  described them as essentially  children . what I think he meant by this is that escapist characters more or less represent an adolescent s idea of what adulthood should be like  namely the first part of maturation  where you decide to live for yourself  think for yourself  and take big risks.the second part of maturation  which factors far less into these pulp heroes  is figuring out how to meaningfully integrate yourself into the world  maintaining your legacy  and finding some balance with the establishment that works for you. conan eventually took responsibility and became the king of aquilonia. indiana jones eventually found contentment in being a university professor and married his long-time sweetheart. clint eastwood s william munny  while not the man with no name  is at least the same character in spirit  but somber with regret and contemplation. there is always something a little sad and shameful about an aging hero without vision  who is trying to re-live his glory days  reverting to his old ways when he feels he has nothing to live for  or acting like a horny teenager into his middle years.we never saw what this phase of lara s life would look like  but aod hinted at a possible direction  however tentatively. I think core understood that lara would not be able to  tomb raid  indefinitely. of course  the other two game continuities would never allow lara to reach this point  because they are plainly terrified of letting her  grow up .so who is this  grown-up  lara who doesnt inhabit the eternal loop of pop culture valhalla  forever the adventurer  but grounded in fidelity and happiness  having discovered some part of herself she never knew was missing  reconciled  in some way or another  with her estranged parents  we may never know.
you know things have gone to the point of no return when  journalists  are obsessed with the sexuality of video game characters. Im sure they are already creating narratives about yoshi.
I feel like my world has been shattered and I live a lie ..  society is so harsh and cruel  glad Im not at fault...  the world is twisting everything.... anyways glad you still posting...
melonie mac is doing God s and Jesus  work - and the tomb raider Gods  work. horus  seth  natla  qualopec  tihocan  atlas  neptune  damocles  and thor  are all smiling down on you and praying your words will bring back their classic queen of raiding.
I never seen lara in a relationship period. not even the classic. because the game had nothing to do in who you are sleeping with. it is about an adventure exploring tombs  alone. these people are insane.
love your content
since last of us proved that original characters can be created with those kind of attributes.   then there s no need to muck up the origins of well established characters.  Im just tired of all the changing just to fit a narrative.  they need to start actually being creative and move things forward that way.  may your day be blessed and I went boom.
they aren t writing lara croft anymore  we really should stop calling this character that  because they clearly wrote up a new character and just slapped lara s name on her.the amount of changes they make to characters is really starting to make my head spin. Im seriously wondering just how interchangeable character traits are  for other people. so far  they can change absolutely everything about a character but the name  and people still buy into it.just imagine your friend swapping names with somebody  and that new person taking your friend s place in their life. thats how jarring this crap is to me  I care more about the characters than I do plot. I wouldn t mind new characters  inspired by   because then at least it wouldn t be a blatant lie.
ok  I ll be the one to say it    if they make lara a fan of the ladies  does she get to be a chaotic-neutral hottie again   boom!
malonie pls make a petition for the game devs to see! we will all sign it for tomb raider! petition for them to bring classic lara s fierce personality back and bring back her femininity. use the woke talking points against these people  give them a taste of their own medicine. tell them that they are degrading lara by covering her up and not letting her wear shorts and prove to then they are being more sexist! girl do it!!! we can get 1 000s of signatures!!!
so just bare with me. so if I was hypothetically a  self inserted character  in thatsequel  it be through actions that build lara up to be the edgy badass that leads to the version you know her best that you discovered her as if they are going with a  re-boot  of course my character would die but not before leaving enough of an inspiration to change her perspective where she fears the unknown to becoming fearless and create her own future where she s fighting t-rexes and stuff on her own without an ounce of hesitation. there would be no  love interest  between my character and lara just to be clear.I also would picture that my  self-insert  character would be in the clouds saying  oh man  I so wish I wouldn t have died  because I would have loved to fight that! lara doesnt need a love interest  she needs people that know how to write her into being a fearless badass that can walk her talk which most of those conversations she does have are really loud is with a lot of bullets.
what a superb write up. you deserve many more likes on this comment!sadly I can only give you one  but I throughly enjoyed reading your comment!
thank you! I should probably just start my own channel at this point  as Ive had these thoughts swirling around in my head for a long time.
@thagomizer  please do  I ll sub just in case!
the gaming industry has wanted to aspire to being hollywood.  that  was  a good thing.
once again  rather than create their own from the ground up  they want to ret-con something already established.
well  they ve literally stripped all of the original joy from the franchise... might as well throw in woke  non-erotic  non-porn-worthy lesbianism at this point...  also  dont think we haven t noticed that we re three theatrical films in and that lara has dropped cup-sizes with each successive installment and has never fought a dinosaur. at least the first movie had a fun-loving  adventurous  and appropriately buxom lara who loved gunplay. very well-played by angelina jolie  who  unlike alicia vikander  is not a charisma-free ironing board. worth a rewatch!
my disappointment is immeasurable  and my weekend is ruined.
why I play tomb raider  to see beautiful  exotic and remote locations I cannot go to in real life because they either dont exist or I cannot realistically pay to go there because I am a blue collar. it never had anything to do with the exploration of sexuality. I dont care about a person s sexuality  I care about the the adventure  the journey.
I will genuinely be extremely angry if they make lara a lesbian  she is the singular figure that is a strong woman who is also straight  literally every other one is gay and as a straight woman who is more tough than dainty  it makes me feel like who I am is automatically unattractive to men. just let her be straight  its not a crime to be straight. istg I hate this so muchhhh
imo  lara wouldn t want to be chained to someone who s going to slow her down or otherwise become a liability.  if she has a sexuality she would deal with it pragmatically. she d maybe hook up to blow off steam once in a while  but never attach herself to anyone. or she d just deal with it herself. either way it isn t something that has a place in the games.
looks up from looking at rule34 of lara you mean she s not already
one or two tomb raider games later... isn t it time for lara to come out as trans
can we just get a normal lara croft game.
tomb raider and crop tops its almost a theme. keep it going mel I enjoy your content. when does my guy jeremy get his referral bonus
laura needed another dad who had abandoned her
having read the graphic novels.... they are just friends...and lara mentions in rise of the tomb raider thatshe lost touch with sam after yamati.
she had both a girl and boyfriend in the womb raider spinoff.
melonie  easter is on the 18 of april. spiderman in the 60 s cartoons was the same as in the 90 s. his personality was pretty much the same.
melonie mac s back!  after being  spoiled with basically a video a day  I almost panicked when there was none yesterday!  but you do you  melonie  take a day off if you need it!  just please always come back!p.s. found a really great Bible verse this morning   Lord God of israel  there is no God in heaven or on earth like you  who keep your covenant and mercy with your servants who walk before you with all their hearts.   2 chronicles  chapter 6 verse 14
omg  it turns out every single established character in fiction was gay the whole time!!!! its all so tiresome.
I totality get where you coming at with tomb raider. I spent a better half or a decade being heavily immersed in wow warcraft lore. once the new writing team came in it really went downhill. I returned to it for the legion expansion and the devs bait and switched the end boss of the expansion. they refused to let the players take out one of the most iconic villains. I guess if was ever to do a channel l would do that too lol.
Imean  didn t every girl have a small crush on her  especially angelina s portrayal  lol... but if they keep turning her into a tomboy  she s having the opposite effect.
in older games we never cared because the story and puzzle were the focus
take a look at the game sales and you d be surprised.
the last tomb raider had horrible casting.
God bless you melonie. have a good easter!
me  holding on to kurtis trent  no
honestly  I just finished playing shadow of the tomb raider  and thought she and unuratu were gonna have a romance
we shouldn t know what she is  all that matters to us is her next quest  also if anything lara croft should be straight
melonie  youre my favorite lesbian of all. oh wait  youre a tomboy. that doesnt make you a lesbian. you could say the same thing about lara.
with everything else they have done to lara why not this too...it only solidifies that this current incarnation is not the lara we grow up with and admired.
these people read into things too much  goodbye being friends  one sign of anything its all about shipping to them together or that they are meant to be  I hate that idea and mentality  why canthey just be friends  no matter if it is male or female  let friends be friends  okay
I know that its an old video but have you thought about bringing back the verse of the day  anyway  Ive been having doubts about my path since my grandfather s passing in january  21  and dealing with the grief of not having him around anymore and trying to figure out what God wants me to do with my life next and its sometimes depressing for trying to think what I should do next.
yea let s make every old character from every franchise raceswap and genderswap! instead of making a new game! thats how we get sales! game flops those racist and sexist bigots! why didn t they buy our game ! edit  I forgot to mention to make them lgbtq  . I dont hate the lgbt  community at all  Im in full support. but stop making everything about who s gay or lesbian  instead try to make a great story first. then add whatever you want.
I just want another tomb raider with fun puzzles and action.I dont think a relationship of any kind is needed to be in a tomb raider game just tomb raiding.am I asking for too much I dont think so but Im just some random  person online so maybe Im wrong lol
I agree with the idea thatsam  as a character  was pretty unimaginative.  I dont miss her.  if they wanted to  they could have just made her a lesbian and have repressed love for lara.  that wouldn t affect who lara  herself  is.  Im sure there are lots of people out there that want her more than she wants them.  in fact  thats the point.  she s unattainable.  I could maybe see lara as part of the hookup scene to get those needs met by someone she ll never see again  but she s not going to fall in love.
so this is what happens if some random people have sexual fantasies yet decide to get drunk and make a post.
how about we just have lara be into herself and the thrill of exploration. why does she need a romantic relationship to hold the gaming fun down  Im so tired of this  -ship  generation.
I wouldn t buy it if they did this to her.
Im playing through shadow of the tomb raider after taking a 2 year break from the game.
man  I completely forgot sam even existed.
lara will always remain a mystery to me and thats how I like it...but plss dont give lara a love interest  let s just get back to raiding tombs
sounds more like people that only care about shipping and not letting characters have close friendships be displayed in media.
when lara was in the sub base  she had a hetero interaction with the char dillinger
I played the first one of the reboot trilogy on release  but I was so bummed down that I didn t even bother to try the rest of the trilogy. even after epic games gave the trilogy for free  I still dont feel like trying it. if we cant have classic lara  give us at least underworld.
@sheila consuelo dawkins  you didn t get the joke. sorry it went over your head.also  Im not your bro.
lara doesnt need a sidekick ... this article confuses me
itsounds dumb  but makes sense in my head... can she be tombsexual . I hope I dont offend anyone
and I want a 300.000 cash  beautiful house by the sea  there is no need to be one of these fancy one - one store  kitchen with a living room  bathroom bedroom and a garage with a cute little mitsubishI in it   a baby tiger for a pet  yes you have reading this right   a boat and a fishing rod   I like fishing - it is relaxing  and autograph from love of my youth - monica belucchi......wait....why I dont have any of this ! triggered   sprouting profanities
classic lara croft in this day and age  forget it
I always seen lara as a loner. not every character needs a partner. besides their argument is having a same sex friend equals gey
she never really was sexual to me Imean she s very beautiful and all but she s like a mountain very beautiful to look at but cold to anyone who goes near her  imo.
the game will contain scenes that would make the movie blue is the warmest color look pg rated.
its frustrating that gaming updates in graphics and other miscellany always has to come paired with a downgrade in good storylines and character building. there s so much potential wasted with these flippant insertions of identity politics.
samus aran is similar with cant be her  cant be with her  unattainable bad ass.
Im waiting for the game that names every primary antagonist after a game journo  and lower-level antagonists after woke game devs.  their mission is to destroy gaming. playable characters will be anyone who has appeared on friday night tights.  bosses will be the most wokesoaked journos like jade  etc.
hey melonie I just want to say that I think thatshe does not have any time for relationships with other girls or guys  ok melonie. anyway also she is fine with being by herself and going on adventures and gathering up treasures by herself instead of being with someone for relationships  ok melonie. anyway also I want to say that laura looks fine as being not gay and fine with being straight normal young lady too  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say bout this topic  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok melonie.
really  mr. homophobic wizard. it is possible for women to hold hands and not be gay. friends can hold hands.  - finch to the stiffmeister  american pie 2. someone should culture this projectionist urinalist. this jade ain t no emerald.
Ive listened to you a lot about tomb raider  everything I know about tomb raider I know because of you. you talk about her being a sexual and unattainable. maybe they did that because back in the 90 s a lesbian in a video game was unheard of. a girl main character was as well. they broke the mold. but they couldn t make her a lesbian.. but here we are in 2022 and its widely more accepted. I dont think its about validating  ourselves  with lara... I think it would just be hot as hell if she was a lesbian hahahahahaha  p
yo. lara dont got time for that. she s not the tied down type.
I guess these guys read the witchblade tomb raider crossovers from the nineties.  those were full of steamy innuendo  too.
I grew up with tomb raider  she is the reason I became a gamer if they are gonna make her lesibian Im gonna quit gaming forever probably
dont worry about being offensive  the only person who can offend you is yourself. lots of the offended today are offended cause they want to be.
remasters of legend trilogy would be great actually. they re like cult classics at this point.
yes. if the croft bloodline has to end at least make her asexual.
hey  Ive got a radical idea!how about gamers  finally  get some  representation  in the  gaming journalists  ! its a crazy idea  I know.
why cant she just be a tomb raider
this game  journalist  just doesnt like that lara is appealing to male gamers. the headcanon never stops with these clowns.
I think there is enough nsfw content out there especially in the rule34 sites and its variants to satisfy this urge
it is that constant men and women cant be friends or trust each other if not in a relationship for some reason with these people.
as someone that has played all three of the newest games  I can safely say that they never had any romantic notions between the characters ever  especially sam and lara. it was like it was never a thought to begin with. I always viewed them as friends who were extremely close. it never once crossed my mind that lara was a lesbo. its almost like the genshin community assuming that all the female characters are lesbian for some reason when every trailer has the female characters fawning over the male mc  never the female one. this weird fascination with turning everyone gay or black is virtue signaling at its finest. because even the people advocating for it dont care that much. they just want to ruin something that already exists to attempt to make way for something they created. look at the new superman  they killed off clark kent and put his gay son in. they ve not sold very well from what I know. I would say if they made a good story around john kent instead of making him gay people would have been more receptive. instead they made him a gay activist and focused on that the whole time. how exciting....the reason they use established franchises and characters and turn them gay is because no one will buy the product if they dont. if they create something new and original  no one will buy it. if they use an established character  some people will buy it. let s be honest  none of the original stuff that these activists have created has ever pulled in money. because its terrible. companies let them destroy their characters which makes them even worse. I would argue the tlou is pretty much the only successful gay character with ellie  but the first game was all about joel and it wasn t even hinted at that ellie was gay till they made dlc for it. the second game was such a train wreck that I dont think anyone cared thatshe was gay or not.if you want an example of a good gay character in a game  andrea rodea from ffviI remake. he fits the settings. its not destroying the story or the mc in any way. he s not trying to go after the mc later once he s reintroduced. thats how you make a gay character for general audience consumption. make them fun. make them interesting. make them original. dont focus on the fact that they re gay and who they like to sleep with. willow from buffy the vampire slayer is probably the most successful gay character. they did a few episodes throughout the series on it. however  it was never a main focus  nor did it ever destroy the story. she was just a person in the world that happened to be gay. granted she was very straight till the college season and it never once entered her mind till someone else that was introduced was into her. again  it didn t over power the story ever is the point.
as az would say   fookin scissoring .  leave lara s sexuality alone.
even if they do make her a lesbian  we need to ask them this question. is lara being gay actually gonna help develop her character  is it gonna be integral to the plot  not that a character s sexuality should be imo but whatever or are you just wanting her to be gay just for the hell of it
change sam to jonah and you can make the exact same point. they just want to push the skittle people onto everyone.
well  she already is on the hub  so not sure what the problem is.
lara is married to her job as a tomb raider  and thats fine. she doesnt need romantic interests  regardless of them being male or female.
what about the comic she had a male love interest there too
game journos have a strange fetish of forcing either two dudes who are bros to the end to be in a gay sexual relationship or two women  like the mentioned sam and lara  who are the best of friends to be lesbians. cantwo dudes or two chicks just not be friends in their mind  considering the track record of  shippers  and articles out there  I think not. sorry dudes  have a best bro  you gotta screw him now. sorry ladies  have a bestie that you ve known since childhood  gotta pull out the double-ended marital aid and get to it.
same sex characters can never be just friends now a days.....even I was ok with ellie  from tlou  being gay since she is an original character. but instead she is villainized and is replaced by a ma ma....
hopefully its just a phase and she will grow out of it. lol
I will never understand this constant push for  shipping  characters in every single franchise  story  game  whatever. like  not every character needs to be in a relationship! it detracts   it distracts from what might otherwise be decent stories.
has she ever had a romance in the games  I dont think any Ive played.
female characters are typically depicted as sexless  emotionless idols who are so innocent that they never need sex and never need men.  from comic books  to video games  to 90 s sitcoms  to dan abnett s warhammer 40k books.
melonie mac  psalm 39 14 is all about living your best life and celebrating God in all things.also melonie mac  is today easter  I dunno...
I hate love interests in general
so the journo wants to make laura  in the words of critical drinker   strong female character . laura doesnt need to be a left wing stereotype  she s a great character as is. making aspects of her character more stereotypical just waters her down
I thought lara was asexual.
go back and re watch the crab people episode of south park from about 10  11  12 years ago  whenever that episode was  and see how thats what s happening now  except for the literal crab people . you ll know what Imean.
many of those teenagers who wrote cringe fanfiction on tumblr grew up and became game journalists.
its lara
you dont even get a say when you cant type the leading characters name correctly.
you are a blessing from God
pretty sure porn has us covered on this front.
I know they never really confirmed what her sexuality is  although I think in the movies with angelina jolie she had romantic interest in men  but the fact of the matter is  if they decided to confirm her sexuality  no one will care if she s straight  but if they make her lesbian  its gonna upset alot of people  not because  they against lesbians  but because of the woke agenda  I doubt even women would like it because not only is she is a strong female character  alot of women look up to her  and wish they could be like her. and I doubt they would like her being a lesbian  and most women arnt...we had lara croft around for almost 30 years  and I think people got it in their mind she is straight  but I think we also aware she doesnt really have much romantic interest in others becuase she loves her work which is why they never really explored thatside of her.there are plenty of opportunities to create new lesbian strong characters for a new franchises.... just dont do it with lara croft..... cause it will cause many problems with the tomb raider franchise  it just wouldent make sense to risk it...
so ground  much breaking  wow
the only reason I would support this girlfriend version for is 2 person co-op. because gameplay and fun   story for me. but I doubt that would be implemented so I dont want whatever this version is suppose to be.
honestly im mostly indifferent about it  since I dont consider the rebooted androgynous blueprints to be lara croft. so for me they couldnt ruin her and the franchise more than they already have done. though their obnoxious whinning as always is is annoying   disturbing. its ironic considering they always moan about the sexualization of characters  while they want whatever lqbt character to literally  get it on  in every ip they hijacked. not to mention the amount  highly sexual  inappropriate and weird things they let their characters say  in comics its even worse  also shows how hypocrite these woke fundamentalist are.
aren t female friends like that  how lara and sam were ....normal best friends...   im confused
you might have thought for all these years that an independent  never tied down  adventuring lara would be the feminist ideal. but a lara whose  feminist credentials have been parasitised by the demands of other groups would sadly be all too reflective of where feminism is these days  so maybe its fitting picard face palm
rule 34   the fuck am I !
this person just really wants something to use as an imagination. if a guy wrote this then they would be shut down called a perv.
and I dont know if this connection is at all relevant  but Ive noticed this strange tendency for lgbtq fanbases to project themselves onto whichever misfit characters they happen to like  until they are somehow convinced that these characters have to be somewhere on the lgbtq spectrum themselves. consider frozen  the petition to give elsa a girlfriend in the sequel   vasquez from  aliens   whom many lgbtq fans assumed was gay  despite the movie implying she and drake were an item   velma from scooby dooo  who is apparently written this way in the newer series  I suppose because every bookish and less traditionally feminine lady must be gay   and any heterosexual-only romance option from the dragon age series. in the only movie we have about the pioneering lady paleontologist mary anning  there is even a lesbian love story shoehorned in  despite the complete lack of evidence that mary anning was gay  and some counter-evidence thatshe was not. it really does seem like the lgbtq community is still desperate for representation.
omg cant anything be just platonic anymore  why does everything have to around a sexual relationship between two people of the same sex  I really think these crazy journos need to stop projecting their niche lifestyles on to others. just because your gay  bI or lesbian doesnt mean that everyone has to adopt your lifestyle choices sexually. Im a heterosexual Christian male and dare wouldn t pressure my hetero Christian lifestyle on to a person opposite of me.they have to find that within themselves and finding God to do so.
if 2 male characters were good friends  they d think they were gay. these fools believe people have to be gay if people of the same gender are friends. its hilarious and absurd at the same time.
no  no girlfried. no boyfriend either  I dont want thatshit in my games.
the original lara croft of the 90s is a strong forthright duel gun wielding agile femme fatale adventure globe spinning counterpart indiana jones and thats the way itshould always be. not some reality tv flat chested emo imposter clone who screeches n complains like some freak air-raid siren that wont shut off every time shit hits the fan in comparison the original lara croft who d just serve up a platter of 9mm bullets adopting her cool maniacal smile while blasting would-be grave robbers and mercs after the same relic that lara croft.
yeah  because shadow  and in many ways the recent reboot trilogy as a whole didn t drive off enough people.always remember that these people benefit more if tomb raider fails.
it is called  tomb raider   not  womb raider.    thatsaid  I would not at all be surprised if there was already a  rule 34  porn version with that name...
what is this obsession with thinking a  strong woman  also has to be a lesbian   seriously!  its like deep meaningful friendships between two women or two men cant exist.  so the only way to  be  the woman she s  you ve  always wanted to be  is to embrace homosexuality
no for f cks sake.. what is wrong with those people.I knew they wanted to make a ellie 2.0 out of her when she was a original before..
dont get discouraged  people are behind you. as you know there will always be haters. just like you said  there aren t many out here who are brave enough to speak the truth. make no mistake  you are speaking truth. in these times we re in  what seem to be dark times  I do believe you are a blessing. God bless.
so in general to be a man.
exactly. every single other female character that is a woman and is strong is immediately turned into a lesbian. as if the only possible way a woman could be strong is if she s a stereotypical manly lesbian. so annoying
outside of that being some teenage boys fantasy  as long as he joins... lara craft is similar to hear or aphrodite they are untouchables by mere mortals and with lara it wasn t supposed to be skin deep. thought to be honest in the new stuff she s below average in personality and above average looks.
Im so glad I play mostly japanese and indie games nowadays. these aaa western games are becoming like modern day disney marvel movies with garbage writing and clear forced agenda s. oh and before anyone tries calling me an ist or phob  I have a brother whom is gay
Im digging the tattoos you have - who s the lady on your left arm
saying lara croft is lesbian is like saying james bond loves puppies and rainbows  or batman collects polka-dotted bowties - even if its true  its irrelevant. it doesnt matter who or what lara likes to have sex with  she s not going to do it while raiding tombs or shooting bad guys  so why the hell should we care
so they need lara with a girlfriend.  I need these journos to become garbage collectors or maybe sewer workers. until now I had no idea how much I need that
on another note  as someone who has been playing the games  reading the og comics etc  since day one  I disagree a bit on your assignment of her personality. but its not a big deal  just glad your a huge fan.
why do they insist on forcing the sex-uality of characters from video games  you hit it on the head that they want to feel validated ....through a video game  the same people who probably haven t played a majority of the lc games as it is. maybe they can just hire you and a few other experts that have played the game to craft her design and her upcoming story. you know a story that actually involves original lara and a great  challenging game.
I was rooting for lara and sam  pity
make your own characters with this characteristic  to begin with. stop taking older ips and projecting your worldview onto them because youre afraid your original ip might flop.
ada wong is my lara croft
seriously!  I grew up liking the lara croft character in tomb raider. I like the fact thatshe s hot  fictional  and if she existed  thatshe would be way outta my league. why cant us straight guys have any characters we like be hot  sexy  and attractive I am sick and effing tired of these woke idiots thinking that everything has to adhere to their worldview. seriously  we riot if this becomes canon -- because Im not letting tomb raider become the archaeology version of last of us 2.
I pretty much agree with you on lara s in game relationship status being neutral or canonically unobtainable because catering to the alphabet mafia s demands will never please them.  if they make lara a lesbian  they ll want her scissoring whatever love interest they give her or banging everything with legs or turn it into a porn game or movie starring lara croft  which is pointless because source film maker  blender and the various content creators of the internet are already a thing that can make better scenes than anything they ll give. its best to leave it to the imagination instead of validating small section of the fandom that may not be satisfied with whatever is given.  some probably imagine that lara is there girlfriend or imagine one more fitting for her.  plus if she s chooses to not be in a relationship there s already some lewd perils thatsection of the fandom can already envision.  unless they make this new game like a mass-effect-like game where she can make choices that influence the story and you can make lara swing for whichever team you want her to swing for  which would be good if they actually made the choices matter unlike the vast majority of the choices in the mass effect franchise.
melonie dont tell me you ve never fantasized about other women b4
lara croft does not have to be a lesbian. her love life   sexuality have no baring on the game story  or the plot  or game play and doesnt hold any relevance. she cant stop mid-tomb raid do a bit of scissoring just to keep the reeeeing  she has to be queer gay  wokier-than-thou mob happy. the fact thatshe was far more interested in the thrill of adventure   exploration with her  damn the torpedoes  attitude made her a much more interesting character.  this is just more of the  I need a fictional character to validate my life choices  .  lara needs to be lara croft.  not bent.
better plan   give lara a boyfriend to really trigger the twitter tumbler activists.
gaming journos literally want any female protagonist to be a lesbian all for the sake of pathetic validation. its the reason why ellie s character was destroyed in lou2. nobody gave a shit about her sexuality we just wanted to see her continue her father and daughter bond with joel but of course cuckmen had to false market the whole game just to get people hyped for the game.
08 10 why does it have to be lara croft rather than a new  great character  tolkien  as always   evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made. .
itsounds like this article is just her fan fiction.
I told you so  the original plan for the reboot was to make lara a lesbian and save damsel in destress sam... Im so glad they didn t do that. no surprise though that in the lara croft comics she s a lesbian coz naturally the comic industry has been taken over by the political zealots that are obsessed by id diversity politics.
rewriting history like normal I guess  lol.
yeah it was just unnecessary and the fact the beginning of the game they had whole scenes about how others were reacting to her being gay  there s just no need for it
honestly  I d prefer an asexual lara. it would make far more sense for what we ve seen from her so far. giving her any kind of  love interest  wouldn t really be that complimentary to her character
so....they want her to be womb raider.journos and perpetually online people have no idea what real friendships are like  so everyone that get along in a space must be romantically interested in each other.gigan is still better than Godzilla.
before they make laura croft lesbian  they should make themselves eunichs. I really hope I got the proper punctuation here.  by God I didn t graduate from high school so I could look uneducated on the internet.
firstly  and respectfully  as a somewhat casual fan of the original tomb raider games  I have to disagree with the notion of lara being totally asexual. there absolutely was a hypersexual aspect to her that played to guys fantasies  but I also totally agree thatshe was fully and wholly obsessed with adventure and adrenaline  which again  is a form of unattainable escapist fantasy.  thatsaid  I have yet to play through all the new games  but while I do enjoy them  Imiss the old tomb raider games. as an aside  Ive long held that the only possible match for lara in a romantic sense was duke nukem. yes  duke. he and lara are both polar opposite hyper-exaggerations of their respective genders. it only makes sense.  anywho  I ll finally add that I respect the hell out of you for having the backbone to be a voice of reason in a world being pushed deeper and deeper into insanity  and wholeheartedly appreciate and applaud your including Bible verses. pure class
technically they were going that way in the remake  but it didn t work. lara in the top 5 waifus
ellie from the last of us is a straight character  and if you dont like it  then apparently you just want to kill and oppress straight people because canon doesnt matter  and besides which  we can easily change it any time we want to suit our agenda. doesnt sound any smarter or any more convincing when you flip it.
the lara sam  will they wont they  dynamic is exactly the same as the leon ada or chris jill  will they wont they  dynamic in resident evil  the reason you spitheads dont think anything of the latter is because its a hetero dynamic.
it can be seen in their chemistry   I thought it was normal for straight girls women to kiss and fuck around lol
there s nothing wrong with people creating their own lesbian themed games but leave the established franchises alone  it ruins the continuity when you feel like you no longer know the character youre been invested in for years. its like they re afraid of making a game of their own and not being able to blame their failure entirely on homophobes and misogynists.
of course they do
basicly  as a fan of the classic lara  I like the other reboot games  but they dont have thatsame magic as the original games  I love tomb raider 2 as this one is my favorite  tr 3 whas kinda great but I lost interest with tr4  I did like legend but also had my issues with it  rise and shadow are lots of fun to play  but story of shadow whas my least favorite  having said that as much as I would like a new tr game  I know allready that we as the fans sinds the original will not be supported in any way  now it will all be about the virtue signaling  sadly
cant say Im surprised  in the new reboot just look at lara s evolution from 2013  to rise  then shadow. her face got nerfed each time. if they listen to the woketard journos I dont want any part of it  I ll be happy to save my money.
also jason from afar cry 3 was friends with guys and he wasn t gay.
shouldn t a sapphic woman just be happy with the fact that lara s a sexy well-built woman  like straight men have been since 1996  if lara s good enough for the male gaze  she should be good enough for the female gays. btw  congrats on finding an excuse to put the word  lesbian  in a video title. everyone on youtube is professionally jealous of you today.
btw you hair with curls is winning.
I like the new games but I hate how they stripped away lara s femininity and figure. you know  two of the things she was popular for back in the day
I know its petty  but now I wish someone would turn a gay character straight  just to see how triggered the woke folks would get from it. they think no one should bat an eye when turning a straight character gay  but you know it would enrage them if a gay character was changed to being straight.
Im with you  I didn t like mcu spider-man  I prefer sam raimI s toby maguire spider-man by a planet size. as eric d july says  he s ironman s spiderboy
am I the only one that tried to kill sam  what an annoying liability that nothing character was.
I want her to be normal
yeah her bff and then itseemed jonah and then no.maybe her cell phone will become her love interest next game lol!. propaganda and subliminal messaging.
@nick  lol.
personally I dont count any of the crystal dynamics games as canon. the whole appeal of og lara for me was thatshe didn t need anyone.
it it just me or do these game  journalists  act like they didn t have toys as kids  now that they re adults  allegedly   they re all hyper focused on taking our toys away and breaking them so we cant enjoy them anymore.
these activists dont understand friendship  they dont have friends. only allies.
dont buy the game day one and this fixes this mess pretty quickly. unless the publishers find a way to make a game free  without using manpower  wahmenpower  people power  whatever.
people trying to turn tomb raider into life is strange.
to be honest as utterly stupid as this is its the least of our concerns with a new tomb raider game. I d be more worried about the 300 pounds of muscle   side shaved head  and ridiculous amount of facial piercings they re most likely going to give lara croft in the new game. the wokies really have a massive hard on for thatside shaved head look and a face full of metal for some reason. you think lara croft was unrecognisable in the reboot trilogy  just wait for this new game. I dont even want to think what lara is going to look like in this new game. maybe they ll even go so far as to race swap her. thatseems to be  in style  with the wokies today. I have zero confidence that this new tomb raider game wont be a massive sjw pandering agenda pushing identity politics filled excuse of a game. and thats on top of the live service bullcrap they re most likely going to force into game as well.
if they make lara lesbian just to score some points I ll skip the next game. I am all for representation but taking existing characters and forcing it onto them to appease a certain group is just lazy writing and uncreative in my opinion. same with race and gender swaps. instead  I feel they should create new and exciting characters to represent people from different backgrounds whether it be race  gender  sexuality  and so on.
social journalist warriors -  nobody can be straight!
why is it for there to be a strong women these days they need to be lesbians  dont get me wrong  I like lesbians  but strength is more than being attracted to the same sex. characters like ellen ripley  sarah connor  samus aren  bayonetta  and clementine  are all strong not due to their sexuality  but their willpower to keep on pushing ahead despite what challenges they face. in my opinion  willpower is what makes a character strong. not muscle mass  gender  sexuality  or anything else.
she cant be lesbian  her hair isn t blue  green  or half-shaven.
this is nothing more than fan fiction but done horribly by the game journos for woke points.back in 2005  I would have enjoyed a lara croft x female damsel in any game.but because of woke culture  I believe thatsome things deserve to only exist in fan fiction when things can be sexy as hell without the political correctness.
all the ingredients are there to make woke trash - I dont have high hopes for a good story. it ll be a gorgeous game for sure - the story will be a dumpster fire
square enix will have the final say and they want to sell the new tomb raider as many places as posable. what do you think will say  no lara is not g  ay  we wnat to sell to china .
gotta be honest  I imagined classic lara was bi-ish not only because she s the type of character who could realistically have whomever she wanted  since she s supposed to be that unattainable power fantasy character that everyone would want to be or be with. but head-canon aside  I think keeping her sexuality vague is the smart thing to do because the moment you hard choose anything  let s say she is lesbian as these game  journalists  want  it rips off another bit of that unattainable aura about the character and grounds her to much. but thats just my opinion.
I thought lara was tombsexual  Imean  she has a thing for tombs  dont you think
the gamer is definitely the worst gaming site. they make polygon and kotaku look like trump supporters. I read an article from them the other day about how kratos should be black in the tv show because he is black in the games. lol what  all their points made no sense. first kratos isn t black  he is greek. he had olive oil tan skin. there is more to be being black then having darker skin. they obviously never played any of the older games. just look at kratos mother  father and brother and tell me if he is black. kratos doesnt have any black features. his beard and facial features just are not black. then they went on about the black voice actors playing him. nadine actress was white does that now makes the character white  not to mention his son. which they claimed was made white to make him marketable lol. these people are nuts.
what is it with today s generation being overtly obsessed with making every character both legacy and newcomer either gay or any other form of  not straight   I get that representation matters and stuff  but how many more lgbtq  characters do they need before they are finally satisfied  I just dont understand it
if they just look up lara croft r34 sfm  they ll see her being a lesbian and also everything else you could possibly imagine.
first time  I partially agree with her. lara shouldn t be gay or straight. her sex life shouldn t be a thing.
why do they want her to be a lesbian  she s been written in books thatshes straight. even her sexuality is a weapon as she admits in one of the games.
the answer is the same  when someone asked jp morgan how much money was enough   just a little bit more...  never give in to the woke... its never enough
why does anyone care what these people think  all they do is project their own desires onto popular characters  and of course any objective opinions make you some sort of pseudo-phobia buzzword. only a complete imbecile would think the lgbt is underrepresented.mel hit the nail on the head when she referred to it as a fan-fic.
its the sense of entitlement that irritates me. crystal dynamics doesnt need to make lara a lesbian in the same way that they dont need to have her dress up in a sexy maid costume because I say they should. they should because she d look amazing  but Im not going to hold my breath.
haha. after your last video I was going to comment that they ll make lara gay. and black. and identifying as a man.how can lara be canon lesbian if we ve gone through multiple games and movies without any suggestion of her being gay  she s strong and independent and doesnt need a relationship.hands off our lara.
I just want to know who plays tomb raider and thinks romance and sex. some games are not rpgs and that is fine  some games dont have our protagonist having romance in his her life and that is also fine. we dont play games to talk about who bangs who  for that there is a special market of games made just for that. I think basing a character and their worth in the medium on them being gay is an insult to gay people and women as a whole. same way we dont look at master chief  arthur morgan or any other amazing character and base their value on the fact they are straight. as we know  people dont like characters that are characters just for being a different race and or sexuality.
rule34 says no.
I could see lara as lesbian.she comes off as the type of woman who wouldn t be interested in men. I dont see the movie lara as the same lara from the games.sexual orientation is a part of being human and knowing whether lara is lesbian  bI  heterosexual or asexual provides additional depth to her character. being a human character  at some point one would expect lara to feel lonely.I think stripping away personal traits of a character breaks the immersion because it reminds you that youre controlling a video game character instead of following the events of a person s journey.
plot twist  lara is asexual and really more interested in tomb raiding than bedroom play...and thats okay.
many questioned the in the firts game ending the player could make the choice if they want elleI to be a lesbian or not and in the second that choice is remove  they chould make option that respect the player choices
there s a reason as to why I dont take video game activist seriously anymore. all they do is preach about politics rather than caring about the storytelling involved. which is why I play video games to begin with. I dont need to see myself on screen to identify with a character. lol
if they follow through with this  I wont play the game.  and I have played all the tomb raiders.
as much as I like the reboot trilogy because they re really well made uncharted clones and games in general  messing with all those franchises is getting really tired. tomb raider  especially dagger of xian  is one of those games that practically made me a lifelong gamer. nothing is sacred enough to these heretics to not cram as much unwanted politics into it as possible.not once in my life did I even ponder the question who lara croft might want to get in bed with. lara was lara and it was perfect.I understand humanizing your protagonists to create more compelling narratives goes a long way but sacrificing the very essence of a beloved character is simply just insulting and cheap parlor tricks. Im getting too old for this crap.yeah  I think Im going to replay tomb raider 2 this weekend and cry myself to sleep  dreaming of the sheer wonder and fascination gaming used to be.
do you guys in the comments have more or less confidence with the new tomb raider now that jeff ross who worked on days gone is working on it.
easter weekend is next weekend  my friend.
make her bI so people of every type can have their fantasies.  people have enjoyed romance in every entertainment medium ever produced so its not strange that people enjoy romance in their games.I get youre not a fan of the new games but plenty of people are  this is just the new lara until she s rebooted again and then the new fans will be angry with yet another interpretation.
as far as lara croft being unattainable and whatnot... im pretty sure rhona mitra was the original body model.
isn t lara catholic  yeah  Im pretty sure she would never be a lesbian.
did lara even have a boyfriend  like I rather she wasn t in any relationship at all because I always enjoy just playing tomb raider games for the adventure.
well... Ive seen lara with plenty of futas...
just make her bisexual because she still like men
Im not even surprised
no she wasn t. she was the second model to promote the games  lara was not modeled after any real person.
@melonie mac go boom  word. I just know rhona mitra did model as lara  and all things considered she looked like she could pull it off just fine.
it would be just like these fools to make the classic gaming sex symbol gay.  they think any emotional connection is sex based
if I was elon musk I would just be buying up ip s to prevent them from being abused.
of course they do
Im just waiting for  abraham lincoln versus zombies  and they make the titular character secretly gay.
tomb raider  legend sold decently.
could they just stop please make them stop Lord!
in all honesty who cares a characters personality  actions  and story and journey define who they are not their sexual preference or gender. write a good character and anyone can identify with them
I wish they remade the original tr games just update the graphics and the controls and I would be happy.
tomb raider  the temple of si-sor
easter is just round the corner!  d  d  d
laura croft isn t a lesbian  if she wasn t going on adventures she d be a cat lady. now you probably hate me.
your amazing
leave lara alone
square enix already owns the  fear effect  franchise and ever since the ps1 games  the main protagonist  hana tsu-vachel  was depicted as a sexy seductive lesbian.just use her instead of making lara croft a lesbian. oh wait  the recent fear effect game  sedna  sold poorly and they canceled the fear effect movie..... rip .
great sunday message
there are web pages that host stuff like this... all the web pages have lots of xs in the urls.
they allready have ellie
they did make lara more manly  that last movie was shyte and the role was given to that alleged woman..... so rebooting it from the boy to whoever they will now will make no difference lara is dead
noooooooo say it ain t lesbo!
its all so tiring.
fans have been saying that for years of many things now and it gets ignored
ever notice how a lot of female comic book characters have a lesbian phase at some point  especially villains.
gaming journos want every character in every game to be gay
cara loft fake lara
next laura will be a transgender person of color
she never wanted to get married
tombraiderdead
dear gaming journalists...straight people exist  deal with it!!!
which angry lesbian wants that fine lara croft
I dont really care. if you ask me  I d make her bi. she can get hit on by both men and women  but she would play it cool and not be in to committed relationships. she is an action game character  not a dating sim
melonie I am catholic and  gamer lara croft and max payne and nathan drake are my favorite game character
nowadays offending ppl is like breathing. too many snowflakes!
it makes no sense if she s a lesbian she would then be bisexual because she was with chase carver and there was chemistry with alex whitman and kurtis in the comics and games anyway I dont really care and why are people so obsessed with characters sexuality also I always think of sam as a bestie
how about no! you crazy haired gaming journos.
lol   boom!
so they want a grave robber to be gay not the best representation they could ask for... I say let them have it.
gaming journos really be out there hornyposting on main. like just go read some fanfiction if its that important to you.
they should have just made a different name up  thats not lara croft and doesnt look or act like og lara.
boom is back!  hiiiiiiii
really nothing new...ever since the games were rebooted this outcome has been pushed by some however I doubt sqenix will allow this to happen for branding reasons.
no she doesnt need to be a lesbian she needs to be unobtainable no love interests light flirting I wouldn t care either way but no outright love interests
if the game devs really wanted to make news they would have a big old heterosexual sex scene in the next game. leave no doubt.  that would be more newsworthy than just another lesbian game character.
I dont get why they need to put sexuality into everythink. cant we just have a game about lara raiding tombs and being bad fing ass
make lara a peepee the misadventures of larry croft    and he she will have lgbtqxyz friend
if Im not sure having played almost every tomb raider she s been hyper obsessed with adventure and has not shown any romantic development so why not leave it there. I guess everyone has to be gay
I thought we aren t supposed to sexualize women in video games anymore..
what s next nathan drake gay
the fact that people care about whome a game character has sex with is friggin weird.... who.... the..... hell...... cares......
melonie great work of course they do they will want to make max payne a antI toxic masculine guy game journalist are terrible
to be frank  I would like for lara to be a lesbian too...giggity!
ever notice how the supposed  allies  sound like the villains in some  80s teen comedy oh  you two are  good friends  huh   you just wanna  spend some time together    I dunno... sound kinda gay to me!  hyuk  hyuk!  yeah  good one johnny!
what fresh degenerate hell be this
why should she  she has two guys that not enough
lara croft doesnt do sex and romance!! she s a fukin tomb raider not girl chaser
these sick people that care only about sexual orientation and gender identity need to be locked up.
I can agree with you she should be asexual
these people would ship david and johnathan from the Bible even though the Bible constantly forbids any same-sex relations beyond friendship.
they only see legitimacy in established characters especially white characters. these game journos are like tumblr they ll sit there and try to ship their fanfic anyway they can and consider it canon. its quite disturbing and they need God...oh yeah they hate Christians I forgot. but I hope crystal dynamics dont appease to these weirdos although square enix ethics department has been actin dumb lately so I dont know.
oh hell naw -_-
I am wondering. do straight girls not wanna have a playable hero who is cool  badass  good looking an straight to identify with
howdy melonie
I expect the screeching from the game journos would be epic.
why not make an all new character in an all new game and announce thatshe s so gay and make that the main theme. see how successful it becomes.dont take an established character and change her! thats weak!
wasn t the main character in fear effect lesbian  another crystal dynamics title.
melonie do you have an odysee account
I called it
f that whole article. 100  mary s ue imp ing.king needs to go write a fanfic and get it out of their system.
why just make a lesbian character instead of changing these icons character sexuality imagine kratos being a gay
b
gaming journalist are not talking about game play  graphics and replay features. they rant about what a game supposed to be. word from the wise  create your own!
every time their is a strong female character  she must be gay!
if I want to see lara croft being a lesbian  I ll look up some r34.
what noooo
palm sunday weekend
fucking journos
how about  no. these people need to stop gayifying every character.
of course they do ! Im surprised thay havn t demanded that lara transitions to a male but still likes men of course so she s then a trans man who s gay that covers the most ground I think
no just no stop messing up amazing classic characters who are legends smh
what is with these people  what s up with them obsessing over inserting sexual agendas into every ip  can we just have some basic entertainment without the extra baggage please
the damage these people do with their crappy fanfic.
Im so sick of this       they want turn my boy tim drake aka robin gay  then they want sonic and tails to be gay  now they want my favourite girls lara croft   wonder women to be gay. Im sick of this small group messing with existing characters  whether its sexuality  race or gender  create new ones  stop changing existing ones. straight women should be furious that they want to turn all the awesome  strong female characters gay  suggesting that if you are straight you are weak.
one of the people making the comics who wasn t a writer  ......... yeah we noticed that !! . .. would you like to be more vague
eidos title
@charming peasant  ah  never played it  but I saw trailers.
haha and now the creator co-writer of the tomb raider games has confirmed she s a lesbian and they ve wanted her to be one
Imean dont we all want that lol hell I d just settle for her being real or being fun again
game journalists already got the trilogy of flat-chested crying simulators they ve apparently always wanted. now they want to gaywash lara. wont be long until we get an article like  lara croft is actually canonically trans and you need to accept it  you bigots.
no. hell no
man  this is so ridicilous. I dont have any problem with lesbians but why  why the hell does lara have to be lesbian now  this is outrageous. if you want strong  lesbian characters  sure  no problem. create a game with this kind of character. create a movie or whatever. but dont change existing characters.its the same with the plan  to make a superman movie with a black superman. -_-much love for your video here  even if I dont agree with all of your Bible stuff. xd
why make her a lesbian    why not go all out and say she was originally a man and transitioned into a woman at the tender age of 10 or 11!!!!
when feeling discouraged  read john 7 6-7 6. so Jesus said to them   my time is not yet here  but the time is always right for you.7. the world cannot hate you  but it hates me  because I testify to it that its works are evil.
let me cringe through this article  -  nailed it.  more woke garbage.
I d rather have gay people exist than not have them exist  but if they make duke nukem gay.... well  it wont improve the franchise or character  I cantell you that much.
of course they want every videogame character to be gay. nothing new here.tomb raider is  or at least was  a pure action exploration franchise. it doesnt need any kind of romance.
why  just why  why cant we just play a game with a fictional character  why do they have to drag in who they sleep with  its a fictional character  I dont care  its not real. besides she s binary.
lara croft cant be a lesbian because  when you look at  unified  lara   she  now looks more like a trans-male.  so  if  she  wants to be a  he   then being with a woman makes them a straight couple!  then  again  maybe lara is a female  transitioning to a male who identifies as female!  smh  only in 2022 could my post be something people actually would promote  rather than a ridiculous exaggeration I intend it to be.
stop gaying everything
yeah  gays and all that. when are you going to buy and shoot a springfield hellcat on this channel
the only lara croft I know is from rise of the tomb raider and never seen the movies they should keep lara as badass female gun fighter and not put thatsjw woke crap in
gaming journos need to actually learn how to play games rather than spew their rancid ideology onto games   gamers!
lmao u can do what ever u want with that fake lara leave the real one out o this bull shit
she doesnt have a love interest in any of the games. male or female
why do all the main female protags have to be lesbian   no. lara croft ain t gay or bi. at least the og lara wasn t. if there was one way to not bring fans together for the new tomb raider it would pushing this just to win some points for a minority that doesnt play the game!
I have come to realize  indians jones cant keep a woman. this clearly means he s homosexual and his truth  his nature  needs to come out so he can finally be happy and free to be himself.
the reboot games and comic story  not the real lara croft lol
@melonie mac go boom   not the real lara croft  that is still lara in a different universe so there s no difference lmao idk why people are so against her being queer
first they get you to say there isn t anything wrong with x  then they go along and do x. rinse and repeat.
if lara croft ends up being lesbian  good. let the new game flop so hard thatsquare-enix will think twice of listening to some urinalist who spends all day on twitter making slash fiction.
blah blah blah blah  until melonie turns the video into a rant about laura croft. boom wait a second...
sam and frodo were gay I saw that boat scene your my best friend. we all knew what he was saying lol
thats not correct  nonsense!
you have gotta be kidding making lara croft lesbian why not make her non binary lesbian and transgender all-in-one well they call that oh yeah a mutant I say once again stop the planet I want off. its a pity that core and edos dont exist anymore if they did they should get the game back and make it the way they did originally bring back classic lara please just remember lara croft was the very first woman main character in a game at the time tomb raider came out before it was all male characters why she was so successful as she was a strong independent very selfish woman which everybody loved thats why it was the best selling game in 1996.
I think she should be bI and they should make a live action movie starring scarlette johansson and doja cat.
no  for fuck s sake leave lara alone. why do these people keep demanding this kind of shit in every medium  here s a better idea  make a lesbian character like lara in her own game and leave lara alone. stop changing characters. actually create something new for fuck s sake.
cant she just be asexual like she used to be in the classics  lara never really showed any romantic or sexual interest towards neither man or a woman in the past because that kind of stuff drags her down in distraction. I dont know  lara was never that interesting when love interests get entangled in her life. lara was more interesting when she breaks the status quo of unnecessary romantic entanglements. she always struck me as a more untamed and unobtainable character married to her uncharted adventure and that makes her far more interesting than getting dragged into some pointless romantic subplot.and  by the way  when fear effect 2 came out  everybody in the media criticized and complained about the explicit bi-lesbian relationship between hana and rain in the game because of   muh misogyny    and now they want to change lara s gender identity for sake of pandering. I dont remember anyone praising fear effect 2 when it comes to representation and that game came out like 21 years ago. what a bunch of hypocrites...
this is all to show that your progressive  but in reality its forcing a agenda  we are seeing this slowly creep into all games .
als things good will be destroyed by the minority of trans   gay   woke crowd.im sick of it.
if they re going to make her a lesbian  then we d better see her go all the way!   seriously  there d better be a  hardcore  cheat code for that game  if they want me to play it.   p
this political sniveling need to stop its pethetic.she s a fictional comic characters.
laura is not a domestic.who could she be with  bruce wayne similar circles   the kingpin big badboys   kate mckinnon makes her laugh   l a seydoux makes her hot .get a poll going!
she s not   I thought they confirmed it with the reboot.  wait  you want lara croft to be a narcissist   a deranged self-loving psychopath    uh...  ok...
yes. for you western Christians  today is holy saturday. go to church!
jeaze. enuf of this crap. its so old to fit the charater to 10  of trolls fantasys.
