how difficult can it be to just create a good story thats loyal to the source material. plus I agree that mental illness needs to stop being celebrated and start being treated.
Im really sick of female characters that are  what if its this male character everyone loves...  but with boobs !   I love a strong female lead  but when the basic premise has her set up as a disadvantaged version of someone else  she can never attain that.  we need more badass women like lara croft and samus aran.
giving something a chance doesnt make one a fool. honestly  her swiping right on every guy was legit funny. at least we get the rippaverse next week
watch it crash and burn  and then watch them blame men for it.   melonie  I imagine that you will be able to reuse thatstatement over and over again  not just for marvel  but across every form of entertainment.  remember that comment.
you didn t make a fool of yourself. you were trying to see it for what it could be  and that is laudable  not something to feel down about. keep being what you are  positive and hopeful. its why we like you.
I knew subscribing to you would pay dividends.between the opening tic toc and the honest reviews  you are already proving worth following.
I loved your skit at the beginning of this video! Im super sad to hear the she hulk show is going to be bad... she s great in the comics. also  I do miss your verse of the day segments. I always got something out of it  and so did other members of the prayer group. edit  the tyra banks clip was great  too. edit again  yeah  I hate it when writers feel like they have to call attention to women being strong instead of just letting their strength stand out for itself.
I feel for you because you seemed excited for the show to not be trash and then... this. thats rough.
I understand the desire to want to be positive  and not jump and point at everything and scream woke. and I can fully recognize that I am hypersensitive to media now  and that even a hint of wokeness hits me like an uppercut to the gut. but I wasn t always that way   current-year  entertainment and media made me that way.it will all be woke  cw-level  expectation-subverting  whedon-esque humor with a heaping helping of low-quality cgi. why  because that is what disney wants  and that is what disney has told us it will be. so why would we ever expect anything else  only after the industry is purged of activists can we even begin to give them the opportunity to rebuild our trust. Im sorry if thatsounds blackpilled  I dont enjoy despising  or being despised by  present day entertainment. but how many last jedis and star treks and lara crofts and halos do they have to destroy  and then tell me Im the problem  before we realize that good entertainment is now the exception. if you expect woke garbage  you wont be disappointed. and then when we get a top gun  its that much more enjoyable.
the sad thing is  she hulk was made during comics foray into the feminist movement of the late 70s and throughout the 80s. she was always feminist  it was just thatshe was a product of men s pov on 2nd wave feminism. today s feminism is nothing like the feminism that created shulkie.
thank you!! I have been saying thatsociety and companies are celebrating mental illness for quite some time.
nice skit at the start lol  I hope your anti-cancelation armor is good because I can already hear the pink haired orcs coming with their pitchforks and torches!!
thats why I ll give my money to the rippaverse instead.
to be fair  mcu  or m-she-u  aren t exactly alone in taking a franchise and not doing a movie portrayal justice by not referring to source material or by failing to be inspired by it. street fighter has had a rough patch of movies and tv series  thinking of street fighter the movie with van damme or street fighter the legend of chun lI - that one has a really weird take on bison s . . . . lore
I feel for you for being so bummed out by this show. I felt the same way toward moon knight  having oscar isaac being a bumbling idiot half the time  and then the other half was just an asshole who was brow beaten by both his wife and his own other personality. I hate to think what they ll do to daredevil and kingpin when they shoehorn them in to echo.
dog  you get a like from me for eating a stick of butter  that was some method acting right there.
car rant at the start about crazy people while eating a stick of butter was hilarious  great intro to the vid
that first part of your video is why I like you and people like you. I have said this in many places way before it has gotten this worse and was laughed at. we are living in the weakest timeline mentally whatever can be salvaged is miniscule because as a whole society is lost and gone.
lara croft was pure awesome from the get-go - and she did it in her own unique way!
I ll just skip this show like I have all shows on disney .
you ve just answered your own question. I ll add lack of treatment with simply stubbornness from current generation of woke creative teams... in the history of ridiculousness thatstarted in the 2010s  these people embraced obama s  yes  we can  slogan with the upmost childish approach.
as someone with depression I hated that movie with jennifer lawrence  it felt really fake and inaccurate.
it is inspired by the source material. tatiana mentioned dan slott s and charles soule s runs as inspiration for the show. this article s headline is badly worded.
in 2022 its very hard in a woke society.
for some reason wokie wokeville has a strangle hold on entertainment. I dont know what these companies are thinking.but its like they re not really interested in making money anymore.Imean look at netflix. I think right now they re worth about half as much as they were a year ago.and the cw network was literally given away. somebody just had to agree to take on all their debt to get it.
its simple  this movies and shows are being made with spite  these people hate what others like because they cant make what they want  because they know nobody wants any of it. theres no love or passion for marvel or star wars  just activism. they dont care about the paying customer or what they would like to see its all about them and what they want.
they re postmodernist hipsters  so its impossible. good stories  three act structure  well-written characters etc these are all  outdated  gauche trash  to their sensibilities.they think art is coming in and ruining as much of an original ideas as they possibly can.
your wish is my writing command
she-hulk is not really one of those though. she s existed in the comics since the 70 s  and was actually created by stan lee. her character is very different from the original hulk and is generally more of a comedic character. I actually really like the character in the comics. nothing Ive seen or heard about this show makes me want to watch it.
@healed1337  actually she came out in the 80s
@tayvo  the cover date for savage she-hulk  1 says february 1980  but like with today  the cover date is always somewhere between 3 and 4 months after the actual release date. the actual release date was november 13  1979. savage she-hulk 2 also released in 1979  december 11
@healed1337  itstill didn t hitshelves until feburary 1980
I dont really care about the gender of a character. Imean I love lara croft  salt and samantha caine  the long kiss goodnight... kinda female bourne  as much as I love indiana jones  bourne and ethan hunt... its not the gender I care about  its storytelling. case in point  james bond  they absolutely ruined that character after pierce brosnan by first pandering to china and make a cold emotionless cardboard cut out  daniel craig  not his fault btw  its the screenwriters management  and then pandering to the woke  absolutely destroyed that character.
I agree with this 100 ! remember when black widow was first introduced  total. badass. they made her into a woke girl as soon as endgame hit and it was really saddening to me.
laurie strode  ellen ripley  the list goes on
@fractureskulldog  the list of people Ive never heard of
no we need good writers who aren t woke subhumans first...
they dont respect the source material  first off. they have to change it for  modern audiences  all the time. if you have to turn something from what it is to something totally different to make your thing  you should just make your own thing.
I will say I appreciated the fact shulkie s design was close to byrne s and the date at the end of the trailer made me laugh  although for meta reasons.
you should watch the trailer  a trailer is the selling point of any movie and itsays it all. she-hulk is gonna be garbage. how do I know  1. the cgI looks horrible  she looks like fiona from shrek. 2. feminism with female empowerment... and I dont mean the well crafted animated mulan one  Imean the modern day  women are instantaneously best at everything  bestist evaah.  coz its an agenda driven mary sue character coz of political idealism... problem with that is well  they cant have any flaws coz idealism  and a character in any story is only interesting by its flaws and weaknesses to make them seem relatable and humanized. 3. the forced cringe humor. its not only lame  but nothing is worse then a forced joke that doesnt land and you know that it was just put in there to be  funny. are you laughing yet  stupid plebs   kinda thing. 4. member berries. in modern hollywood  a shitshow always has tons of member berries to refer to its far superior predecessors and reveals the intention of the writers  by trying to get people to watch not by coming up with a good movie story  but by playing on nostalgia and trick people into watching this  coz you liked that other thing . 5. related to nostalgia  the cloning and clowning of successful characters only to gender swap. particularly a boring curse in the comic industry that gets copied by the real action series of both marvel and dc.
as long as it crashes and burns it doesnt matter who they blame in my eyes
seems like its par for the course these days when it comes to mainstream entertainment.
@dying rose  oh for sure  I basically assume things will suck until proven otherwise  but I do love having optimists like melonie around so I dont get too cynical.. otherwise I absolutely will
aye. I used to be an ally but they took it too far and became the oppressors.
never watched blade or shawshank and thought a black man  I knew they were chosen on merit and the talent to be the best for the role  now I think was that choice only made to tick a box and appease the head of diversity.
we would need to see a true revolution of thought  a shift in the matrix  or spiritual awakening  to get rid of wokeness.
you can be woke. but dont make it too blunt. have it be a natural part of story
the most frustrating part is I actually have ptsd gad due to severe trauma  and these people make me embarrassed to even admit it  lest I come off as one of them.
I can hear ian mckellans voice  reee-ing...reee-ing in the deep...they are coming.
true  the street fighter film with jcvd wasn t very accurate  but darn it if ra l julia didn t give it his all  and it was overall enjoyable. that movie about chun-lI on the other hand...I dont know what they were doing.
now they want lara to have girlfriend
atta girl
yeah  Im running into this issue with the boys. I know the boys original source material was political but many have said that the book pushed things to such a disgusting and pure punishing degree you couldn t film itand apparently people didn t like the last few issues. but unfortunately  this season 3 especially  the show is going for the incredibly obvious talking points the media loves to just glorify and make a big deal out of  it feels distracting and just out of place as well as not edgy or biting at all.
speaking of cosplaying classic lara  thatstar wars girl is doing that for 1 month of next year s calendar.
haven t watch you in a while and your hair look cute. you know a person is not a comic book fan when they call the professor  the smart hulk . she-hulk was a teenage boys comic not a comic for girls. the fact that the actress likes the hulk s actor is a big red flag for me.
even in the late 80 s early 90 s comic books were on a major decline back when I was a kid. I dont understand why comic book movies are so successful yet no one ever even read the comics.
love the she hulk  juggernaut hook up where they broke they room.
cant believe that in the entire episode every male character in it was a joke  and every female character was perfect victim. the bar restroom scene  mexico s arc  court s arc. cant believe I watched the entire episode.
one would think a show based on she-hulk  would be inspired by the comicbook she-hulk.naah! that would make too much sense!
ha ha! that opening.
I love butter  bwahahahaha. thank you for this. your insight  character  and spirit are a breath of fresh air. you  ms. mackgoboom  are bleeping fantastic
your intro is 100  spot on. we have a whole month dedicated to celebrating mental illness  Im so glad june is over...
Imean  this was probably my second least anticipated mcu tv show next to ms marvel initially  and tbf ms marvel has actually been pretty enjoyable so far . but once I saw the trailer for this I was like  ok  I feel like I could enjoy this . at the same time  we know how trailers work  sooo...I heard matt murdock dd   potentially jessica jones would be making cameos in this. Im watching this to see if they actually reintroduce jessica into the mcu  she was a badass and thatshow was pretty awesome. and obviously daredevil was great too.I just hope this show doesnt go over the top with the feminism angle as this article implies. can we just get celebs actors whoever to stop being a mouthpiece for whatever cause they re trumpeting  I feel like the world would probably be a better place.
fun fact  the she-hulk comic were she was a lawyer  only lasted 8 issues before being cancelled for not selling.
adhd is usually treated by doctors with amphetamines  even though it often is caused by mercury and lead which can be chelated with cilantro coriander. I didn t mind being prescribed dexedrine when I was a kid  it was nice to be able to focus and get things done  but not being able to afford medical insurance after my mom and stepdad couldn t use me for survivor s benefits and threw me out made life a real joy for the cold turkey ordeal of coping without the stupid drug. cilantro does seem to help somewhat with focusing again  but its still difficult to open plastic bags or use both hands at once in a coordinated manner. even worse though is how asperger s was treated when I was a kid  risperdal. -_- really having asperger s is more or less like saying  my personality type is istj intj  here s crap Imemorize fixate on  like with the tomb raider for you or train schedules for istj subtypes  etc.
nice intro lolhonestly I figured the show would be bad from the line about fear and anger from the trailer but I would ve cheered and watched if it was actually good. oh well. there s always the comics.
we should just call it what its going to be  ie ally mcshehulk  and as you note question who this is going to be for  are superhero fans really going to be interested in struggles of  single green female lawyer  as she tries to balance work  dating   being superpowered   are relationship drama fans going to interested when the melodrama is going to be tainted with sci-fI Im sure ppl will tune in for the first few episodes   then it will drop off in short order  men will be blamed for not watching it   called bigots for daring to criticise it.
I who have adhd I do not celebrate it  is something can be a pain in the ass with work and relationships but I learned to focus  for decades I needed to use medicine like ritalin then strattera to focus on the tasks  and really gave me some issues with my gf  she thought I was not interested in her but she has understand about it.now heading back about she-hulk series truly is gonna be doa when it gets out  we have seen it with bat woman  birds of prey putting an agenda over quality and a good story but shemcu is something they want so badly  once it flops there gonna blame the patriarchy and white men of not watching it.melanie  hope I wrote your name well  dont blame yourself  I too thought maybe they would do a good show but with the trailer and now this  have erased the desire to watch it.
Im glad I wasn t drinking anything when I saw the tyra banks clip.
yeah mel  they ruined she hulk already for us... I had high hopes....
I 100  agree that we should be treating mental diseases instead of celebrating them. I have bipolar and I got help over 13 months ago. with proper medication and weekly therapy  I can say that getting help was the best decision of my life. everyone  especially men who have bipolar reading this message  youre not alone  there s help and you will get better. youre in my thoughts and I believe in you. dont give up  youre important and you have worth in this world.
they re celebrating it because they want special treatment. this video was
no one who picks up a comic today gets to read a good storyline with strong character arcs we just get woke crap being preached at us with huge logical gaps. so I cant blame anyone for taking a hard pass on comics today.
punisher was also rumored to make a cameo in moon knight. that didn t go well.
@adanu191  thats why I dont have high hopes for the rumors... but I never heard that particular one about punisher. all Ive heard regarding punisher   moon knight is that they may spin off into that dark street level superhero team  name is escaping me right now. including those two  blade  ghost rider  etc.
and is now more popular as a  fortnite character
I was put on risperdal too  piled on weight  developed man boobs from it   a common side effect  now in my 30s I am working out daily and have lost maybe 60ibs but from the effects of the drug theres still my chest area that Im conscious of.
@adam  yeah  thatside effect is horrible for those in which its more pronounced. fortunately  even as a kid I d often refuse to take anything just out of defiance  reducing my dosage effectively  though for what effect it did have due to my body type  somewhere between endomorphic and mesomorphic  and not losing muscle mass even if I lose muscle tone for a time  the annoyance of manboobs for me is more like occasionally coworkers will lecture me about how  steroids are bad  even though Ive never taken any. it wouldn t surprise me though if part of putting kids with asperger s on risperdal was to lead to the whole  Imust be more like a woman  crap later  if not merely for the sake of alienation and increasing suicide rates among those deemed as subhumans by eugenicists.
oh man  I was hoping for an entire  car video!  haha
they cantry to blame me for it. my response will be  how is it my fault  did I not support it enough  was I supposed to bend over backwards to prop it up  are you saying it wasn t good enough to stand on its own  and it needed men to carry its weight  thatsounds like the stereotype of traditional gender roles. the man does all the heavy lifting and all the hard work while the woman is supposed to sit there  be pretty  and cant do anything by herself. that isn t the kind of world we live in now. if a show is going to succeed  it will do it on its own merit  I will not carry its dead weight like some 1950s trophy wife.
was she eating a stick of butter in the intro
this is a clickbait headline. what she actually said was thatshe used sophie s music to get into character. she uses music to get into every character she plays  its part of her process. the show is still inspired by the comics. she also said she read as many comics as possible in preperation for the show and even listed dan slott s and charles soule s runs as inspirations for the show in a previous interview.
am I crazy or is she eating a stick of butter it makes me sad that disney has gotten to the point where they d rather push an agenda  than entertain an audience.
just assume everything is going to be crap and you ll never be disappointed.
I wouldn t even sail the seven seas for this.
she-hulk  attorney at law sounds like a cheesy 80s show
if you look outside your window you can see a plane writing  we told you so  on the sky  original trailer was full of red flags.back on my keto days I would put butter in everything  but biting a bar like that would have made me sick
my brain short-circuited when I saw that you were eating a stick of butter like a snack
Ive never seen anyone just casually eat a stick of butter. Ive seen it in cartoons  but this was new.
Imiss the verse of the day.
she says this while eating a stick of butter like it is ice cream.   just kidding I know why.  it just struck me as funny
I feel like this would have been better handled on netflix back when they did the marvel shows. instead we ll get a barely watchable show that Im in no hurry to see.
9 27 I love that youread your own tweet and followed it up by saying  which is true . ha!
imagine thinking anything by marvel or disney is going to be decent.
people have no idea how good kerrygold butter is on carnivore. lmao.bring back the verse of the day!
I thought you were eating a stick of butter at the beginning
youre so good. love it  go boom
thatstick of butter lol
would ve been different.
yes  eating a stick of butter while complaining about other people being nuts while sitting in a car is a funny dig at all crazy car rants
omg I am a clown
@melonie mac go boom  - thats why we love ya  mel. keep being you.  -
maybe you thought that because I actually was
@melonie mac go boom  my niece does the same thing  youre both sick!  lol
holy shit  Im pretty sure that article gave away the villain. the creepy  specimen  guy is listed in the highlighted actors  jon bass
they need a sitcom where she hulk shacks up with juggernaut.  that I would watch...
eating a stick of butter for the win!  haha!
I love melonie beautiful cat eyes.
luve that intro! just casually eating a stick of butter...  nice !
I was surprised when you were positive about the trailer the new stuff coming out of marvel studios is coloured by a clear agenda. its unfortunate that they ve sacrificed good storytelling at the altar of woke  but hey  its their decision. and my decision is not to give them any money for it.btw  anyone who believes that man and women should be treated equally is a feminist  we are different  but we still deserve equal rights.the agenda we see today has nothing to do with original postulates of feminism. if you cant even define what a woman is you have no place calling yourself a feminist.
honesty I feel like Im gonna have a great time with this show.. like totally destroying it because I dont care as much about this ip as much as I did kenobi. Im gonna tear this series apart.
thank you  finally someone gets it
a while back I heard you trying to hold out hope that this show might be good and I really had to question your basic for that. I wrote off marvel after endgame and once disney showed their hand in florida I knew it was over for good. not another dime from me  wouldn t be prudent.
honestly  this doesnt surprise me. I had a feeling this show was gonna have far left messaging. even if we watch the show and it isn t that at all  I still hate that this is how they re marketing it. modern day feminism is a cancer to society now. I wanna have hope for the future of the mcu but so far phase 4 has had some underrated hits and mostly big disappointments.
saul goodman will always be the best attorney at law
that butter looked delicious
boom yes  nerdrotic coined the term...m-she-u.
its depressing to me to see what disney s done to star wars and now they re starting to do it with marvel which is a shame because of the thanos saga was incredible. now Lord of the rings is getting it. what audience are they catering to  star wars obviously isn t catering to the ot fans. hey let s take this crapped out palpatine clone so we can make anakin s sacrifice and chosen one prophecy meaningless and completely destroy the skywalker name. I dont know. I guess I need to find some new hobbies or something.
after watching this video  I find myself considering eating a stick of butter. lol
why is she eating a stick of butter in the car  also melonie your looking beautiful as always and are you going to be doing the verse of the day again
I assume by celebrate they mean   not make them feel bad that they got something that is both bad and undeserved.   of course  that goes hand-in-hand with treatment.the woke should not neither play doctor nor presume to be doctors.thatsaid  I recommend the she-hulk comics from the nineties before deadpool precisely because they re a hoot.
is no one gonna mention the fact she is eating a stick of butter the whole time she is talking
as to who buys the comics  not a lot of people.  the comics didn t really have long runs and was restarted a few times.
how is it that your personality actually keeping up with your beauty... we agree on almost everything lol
the most hilarious thing is  even though they think they are making these female characters as strong as men  they still have to make the men in these movies bumbling idiots so the female character s can win.
I dont mind if she blames me for not supporting her. I noped out after ragnarok  I could see the writing on the wall even then.
was that a stick of butter
I just had a thought at the end of the video. if they blame men for the crash and burn. itshould be an equally valid argument that women made it crash and burn because they didn t support themselves by watching it. like in the trailer  all the women wont watch it because she-hulk as a better ass. before you know it  cat fights  hair pulling and face scratching will break out like a biblical plague. all because of those nasty women.
I assumed mark ruffalo was already the female hulk
ms. mahs - lah - nee could ve steered the narrative in the opposite direction - she could ve made the claim that   after having watched the jd-ah trial  the writers were inspired to rewrite jennifer walters  she-hulk  to be more like camille vasquez   at least whenever walters is in court   during any press interviews  .  could you imagine how many more potential viewers that thatsingle statement could ve drawn but nahh  she didn t even go with that more creative  more audience-drawing route with her statement  she just went full npc instead. alternatively  marvel disney could ve had her hold off on stating any character summary  until the writers director showrunner themselves had said anything.  9 25  - btw  in your tweet that you showed  you stated lara s a heroine  but in a previous video  you stated she s not a heroine  she s an anti-heroine  rather  a  neutral  mercenary driven by treasure  whether doing good  or bad  would lead her to it  .  Im confused.  which is she - anti-heroine  or heroine also  was that an actual stick of butter margarine  or an ice cream bar made to look like one   cause.. kudos for committing to the bit  if it was an actual one.
itseems that wong is the new nick fury because they dont want to pay sam jackson to just continue being the character. wong is no fury and Im kinda sick of him  itshould ve been strange but once again played by an a list star  disney is cheap lol.
well she is a attorney in the comics but  thats not  the focus of her plot in the hqs
I prefer reading byrne s she-hulk comic omnibus series. I highly recommend to read it  you wont be disappointed. trust me on this  way more better than the disney incoming utter trash.
0 05 Im sorry is she eating butter-
there s a reason Im not paying for anything disney is crapping out. everything since endgame  with the exception of spider-man far from home and no way home  has been absolute bs. I cant wait for the entire franchise to go belly up already.
sophie died while taking a moonshot selfie from a 3-story balcony. we re supposed to draw inspiration from narcissistic lunacy
how are you just eating that butter with big ol bites   lol.  and I love good butter.
we re celebrating mental illness  actively eating a stick of butterthat being said tho  I agree that this show was a travesty
based women doesnt exist  they cant hurt youthe based women
this is from the perspective of not having seen any of your other videos on she-hulk or the comments below.I have watched the first 4 episodes so far. I am someone who will watch these regardless of their quality.  episode 1 was a real snore for me and hate the mary sue nature of she-hulk they were creating.  but as I said  I will watch regardless of the quality....so on to the next episodes.   things pick up after that but the whole  this is inspired by a transgender person s life  or the  this is a uber-femisitstory .....yeah  if that is what they were aiming for then I haven t seen it beyond subliminal messaging.  I guess  episode 4 tries to paint the whole  men are pigs  feminist belief  especially with the guy she hooks up with   when you think about it the show clearly show jen and she-hulk are the same person  not two personalities like bruce and hulk   yet despite this the show inadvertently    reveals a truth about the everyone else in that universe and the fans who watch the show.  the truth being that no matter how much bruce tries to integrate the hulk and himself or how much jen wants to claim there is no extra-personality....the reality is there is a difference between the person and the hulks.  people will  care  about one or the other...there is no middle ground.  the two are unique individuals personalities no matter how much jen  or the show  says otherwise.  sorry for the long rant....here is hoping that the relatively enjoyable show  despite the non-funny jen she-hulk  continues.  but thefact you say that there is a new director after episode 4...oh man....
questions 1  has she-hulk been released yet   I have seen the pattern of these stuios  and I recognize that the thespians are doing a dismal job in promoting the show  it would be a shame if the show was actually watchable yet had no viewers. 2   should bounding into comics be your only source   in today s media  have found in the past that the original article is the best source.  secondary and responsive articles have left out details.  which is the short version of why I dont trust the daily wire. 3  where s is the alternative   I know that they re out there  these are small studios with little press.  why doesnt someone promote them   ie  have you seen the chosen or something from john schneider studios   and the daily wire does not count! 4  this is the most important   where is the verse of the day
video got a like just for the butter intro
while on the topic of wokeness wrecking tv shows  the boys has gotten really insufferable lately. there s so much bottom tier leftist satire now that its almost funny  its like a parody even though the showrunners are 100  serious lol
hold up hold up  was she munching on a stick of butter  what
Ive only seen season 1 and 2. how is 3
@pierson md  I thought it was really great up until the finale! with the exception of a few boring scenes with todd or public events that barely qualify as satirical  it was good and had awesome story moments and great gore effects. unfortunately the finale was absolutely awful. I wont spoil it for you but suffice to say it messed up some character arcs and had no resolution whatsoever  the entire season was completely pointless because of how they ended it.
I happen to think black widow and ms. marvel are very strong female leads that need no male assistance....also wonder woman and captain marvel as well...jmo!
I still think its going to be cool. Im going to watch it. sometimes you just have to take things with a grain of salt otherwise you cant watch anything on tv  movies  or read any books.
it was the third time I watched the intro that I realized... thats a stick of butter. or a substance that looks like a stick of butter.
its disingenuous to judge this series without watching it  plain and simple.
why she s eating a stick of butter
this needs more views and likes
super garbanzo beans  nice to see a woman speak on this
I knew tatiana was bad news when she got casted for ashen hulk!
was that butter she was munching on at the beginning  I am still trying to compute
happy to be an boomer!
was that a stick of butter you were eating at the start of the video
good intro
hiyanew boomer here!glad I found ya channel!love ya style!
bro ngl sophie slaps I love her or his music hahaha
we live in a society
love to hear thoughts on eric july youngrippa59 new  rippaverse isom  1.
one thing I wanna add  the she hulk looks like shrek his wife imo
I see u munching on that butter like its a candy bar. I get it
they change the content and messaging to match the loudest voices. the loud voices are misconstrued as the target demographic and it ends up appealing only to a fringe niche. mcu should be wondering where the female audience is and how they are missing that target so badly..
good evening melonie u had donefine job saying the actresses namesbetter than I could lol.I wanted wish you to have nice relaxing weekend takecare melonie
need some bacon with that butter
I thought she was eating butter lol
are you eating a stick of butter in that opening
were you eating a stick of butter at the beginning of the video  lol
were youreally eating a stick of butter     lol
hey   were you eating a stick of butter at the beginning   I do thatsometimes.
its foolish to give marvel  or anything disney  the benefit of the doubt. when have they not spit in our faces  come on now.
disney marketing is awful. this reminds me of the early marketing for cruella  and jungle cruise. they were both not great but good
I think you enjoyed that bar lol.
law and order svu was a big hit
hey melonie I just want to say that your skit of you eating butter was lovely and cute and I really really enjoyed it melonie. anyway I just want to say thatshe-hulk tv series would not have a very very good story line for her in the series bc it would bout her being a lawyer and have discovered thatshe has the same dna powers like the male hulk and she could do same things like male hulk would do in the series  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say that bout the tv series she-hulk and I just want to say that I love and like the skit that you did of you eating the butter in the video  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets   have a great weekend too melonie.
silly me  I assumed she-hulk would have been inspired by she-hulk comics.
eating straight butter is a flex while spitting facts  but does it actually taste good
0 55 - 0 59 truth be told  so was I  mostly because of hulk and abomination.
melonie as a sexy she-hulk   anyone   I d pay for that.

8 16 thats cassandra cain batgirl my second favorite batgirl . idk what comic that image is from  but why is she standing over batman with her foot on his chest  I need context. that just seems off.
casandra ca n trained by league of assassins  bruce has even said she could defeat him. that tweet is way out of context. I swear both extremes of wokeness and non-wokeness have no idea what they re talking about when it comes to comics.
where you eating butter in the opening bit  I hard pass on all disney  I have the terminal list after all.
wait... are you eating a stick of butter     lmaoooo I have never seen that in my life wtfffff

called it!
wtf are you snacking on lmao
she is missing the muscles...
hey  love the videos but I do wanna say the reason I think we have allot of mental illness issues that weren t there before is because of allot of the pollution in the air  the bpa from plastics  all of the processed foods out there. I think we need to tackle thatstuff so future generations wont have to deal with all of this. I also blame allot on how people are these days. people are rude ass hell  make fun of others openly  gaslight  lie .
she is so based
you eat butter by itself     wtf
why are u casually eating butter in the car
whats up with the butter
cholesterol and butter are good for you
I agree. toxic people  toxic environment  toxic food.
well that doesnt help either  no. but its also based on their own worldview as well. where do we come from  why are we here  where are we going after we die  etc  etc.
marvel phase bore continues.    out of curiosity  anyone know how the horrible ms. marvel show is doing   I refuse to watch it  but I just wonder if its the powerhouse show disney hoped it would be

hey  mac  have you seen top gun maverick
Im sorry but was she eating a stick of butter at the beginning
where are the verse of the days
they are trying to turn she hulk into a feminist icon not realizing her original popularity was because she was eye candy for years to male marvel fans.
female centric
why butter
she looks pretty great for a boomer
cancelled my disney   subscription last weekend. since I was tired of funding sub par content on disney s streaming service. guess Imade the right decision  lol
butter or margarine
you didn t make yourself a fool for defending it. for you it looked interesting no on can say anything about your opinion. another thing Imiss the Bible verses and the comment section part anyways have a blessed weekend
disney have severe inferiority complex against the original marvel comics.
this makes ms marvel not woke compared to she hulk
no shot you eat a sick of butter.
butter lol
a strong green female character who is sometimes human already exist  this is princess fiona in shrek.
mmmmmmm...   butter.
no offense whatsoever  melanie  but you were so naive to believe that this wouldn t be hijacked by the message.
what was melonie nibbling on at the start of the video
yes I agree the world is celebrating mental illnesses  most of these are sin based . but what the world needs now  is the one and only true therapist  that would be Jesus Christ or savior and Lord! hang in there my sister in Christ. I hope you I are spoiling that little nephew of yours!
@melonie mac go boom       have people not learned...    no they have not. moreover  they are in no way open to learning...
es you were right
loving the content.  what not verse of the day... disappointing.
I just hate the blatant mary sue writing... they aren t even trying to hide it. just going right for the op character development out the gate...the character doesnt seem humble or genuine at all because   she can do everything better  without earning thatskill....
stop eating butter now melonie
its gonna be hilariously bad. not worth watching hilarious but almost. also  sophie  is the re-re that they wanted to change one of saturns moon s name for but literally no one cared. bro climbed a building or an antenna on a building and  fell . its gonna be so bad.
butter.
we re u eating butter
iam a m-she-u loving feminist whos looking forward to this show!!! yasssss queen! go boom!!!
you called it
kerrygold butter
@melonie mac go boom  thanks melonie. love listening to your opinions  I never miss a video. thank you for everything you do.
never
dont margarine-alize butter lovers.
@myenemy  very punny people here.
more interesting in what the snack you was eating  then another milk toast msheu show.  current run of she hulk in the comics is trashy. no wonder manga  selling more than american comics
its going to be like birds of prey they say to the male audience fuck and then blame the men for why the movie failed
I thought elon musk was going to save freedom of speech
what a shocker. I have other things that are more worthy of my time  anyway.
90s feminism is fine. nowadays bs no. show us you are a badass dont tell us.
stopped doing to scripture of the day at the end  thats too bad.
look what they did to my ginger titania. shame marvel shame!!!
ha femanism made me chuckle a little
you were actually surprised  really  hopefully you ll learn something from this about marvel.
yes
2 months later we see she hulk is the most antImale feminist rant of show possibly ever
get ready to be called a bunch of  sexists  yall
wtf r u eating butter
everybody in this comments section looks so stupid right now. the show ended up being so good.
marvel is going down hill  with movies and tv shows
bipolar disorder... adhd... eating a block of butter... feminism...
why the hell r u eating butter
the cgI looks horrible
so a skip
character is named a common american name.  actress isn t.  are any actors  actresses  directors americanthese days   we need a new clint eastwood to rise from the manure and tell all of these people  quietly  shut up and do your damned jobs.
rip dreams
poor stan lee he is suffering in his grave because of this sh   t!!!
really you just had to eat the stick of butter for content
it was always m-she-u trash.
see if parmount picture stell had marvel the people world have understood it then disney world have
glad to see a girl talking about the woke disasters nowadays. I think not one guy dislikes a strong female lead character. biggest example is ofcourse lara croft. hollywood is sick and just makes series or movies acording to their political agenda. they just aren t able to create a real good well writen female character and itshows. so what do they do  they remove all the heroes that were once a man and turn them into a woman combined with the bad writing and making fun of the man character hero. this is realy getting out of hand. like marc ruffalo looks like an idiot in this she hulk series. why do that  there is no reason to degrade him into an idiot. just create a original good well writen female character and Im fine. I realy love a good female leadcharacter but nowadays its just over the top political shit they shove into our faces.
as a 9 episode comedy series  comedy series    as a she-hulk fan myself. that really disappoints me.
aren t over 50  of lawyers in the us women.
I wish she wasn t but she is... skip this one its gonna be garbage...wait for the day when she hulk will get a good writer and do her character justice
imo marvel is over for me. and it ended with endgame for me wich was already not as good as infinity war. since then they lost my intrest. I think as of now the fans will drop every year.
oh well. more trash for writers  executives to fail upward.
why was this girl eating butter on screen like come on I dont get it its that a new trend for this new generation of kids or what for the butter I dont get it Im confused
are u eating a stick of butter in the intro to this  if so that is disgusting.
I wont be watching it  I will be reading  I will be writing  I will be doing anything but watching this crap.
do not care for this show  lol
wouldn t even pirate this crap
still sounds like a harvey birdman attorney at law knock off.but. very bad.also nerdrotic took m-she-u from fiege himself but nerdrotic uses it very condescending way lol.
eating thatstick of butter at the beginning  Imean I wont judge but yeesh that made me cringe lol.
are you eating a stick of butter  eww
why isn t the comic or standard female character showing up to help women s sports that transsexuals invade and then dominate
want to harden your arteries real quick eat a stick of butter
well not gonna watch it
oh boI really annoying af those feminist and gay people must not do scripts!!put a person who read a comic books and know how to put a great story together!
this comment may be late but for real I need to said this  a week a go I saw the serie and Im just wondering  why de producers have to do all this bllsht about female victicism  using the same excuses to make a female character an instant mary sue  is like when is about to develop a female character they stuck in the same awfull  feminism  political correct idea. this just make me hate more the series were the protagonist is a woman  just as same with   birds of pray   charlie angels  etc etc   even if I am a woman and itsuposed that I have to feel related with this kind of series it doesnt actually connect.  sorry form my bad english
m-she-u portrayal of she-hulk is an abomination. no more Bible verse  oh  I see butter I thought you want to spread the word.
why do you eat butter like that         what is wrong with you
pray they never make another tomb raider  they ll probably cast a black actress who ll return artifacts to the countries her white dad looted them from  her abusive chauvinist dad also murdered her black mom and he turns out to be the movies villain but dont worry lara kicks his ass and defeats the patriarchy.
but it is about woman power and bashing on man. you should love itsince you are a woman
I give up simple as that mcu is donefeminism and your target is 8 to 14 yr old boys   ok just try it. go ahead and see what happens
the show is not even on yet. at least see the the first two episodes then make youre opinion.
you women have a distict reason to exist...you would be best to understand that reason.
I knew this show would be dog water months ago cuz there was a crazy racist feminist as one of the writers for this show  making a big stink about white people. and south park.... of all things . by the way. is that a stick of butter   you were eating at the beginning of this video  not dissing just wondering... well maybe just a little. that is kinda funny
why did you mutilate your body with those horrible tattoos
I got bored of this mcu crap after the 2011 avengers movie. its just oversaturated  milquetoast and boring. its just action porn. no substance whatsoever imo.
marvel suck
go boom   dislike
