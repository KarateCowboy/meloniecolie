to them strength in women has to be a masculine form or its unacceptable. galadriel was badass in her own way and this just goes against everything she was created to be.
that explanation of galadriel from the show runner  4 10  just ticks me off. as someone who has studied old and middle english  both academically and independently   crowned  just means that you have something or are wearing something on your head  or that you ve placed or smote something upon another s head .  crowned with gleaming hair  just means her hair is shiny. its a descriptive epithet.if they wanted a better argument  they would point out that one of galadriel s names as a child young adult was nerwen  or  man-maiden   because she stood on par with the average male elf in height and strength. that concession aside  itstill contradicts the lore to have her as a warrior  because tolkien said as much. and as far as the world of arda is concerned  tolkien s word is the law!
calling galadriel a mage is not really correct either. the only mages were the 5 wizards  saruman  gandalf  radagast  and the 2 blue wizards. the wizards were actually demi-Gods known as maiar  as was sauron. a more accurate term for galadriel would be a loremaster  still not a warrior . the magic of the elves and dwarves was in their ability at crafting. hence the rings of power and the various magic swords  and other devices. galadriel was the keeper of the nenya  one of the elven rings of power. galadriel was also already a queen in the second age. she and celebrimbor ruled eregion before moving to lothl rien. the so called experts consulting on this show dont know jack squat about tolkien.
lotr isn t fire emblem. you cant just reclass a mage into a warrior.
us  can we get galadriel amazon  no  we have galadriel at home.galadriel at home
galadriel wasn t a warrior because she thought it was beneath her. she spent most of her time in middle earth desiring a kingdom of her own to rule. she was very full of herself. when she denied the ring she was so relieved because she d finally overcome the arrogance that led her to be forbidden return to her homeland.galadriel would have led a war  maybe  but she never would have actually fought on the lines.
my dad is a 60  black guy  since sjw s really seem to only care about skin color  who is a huge lotr fan. read all the books a few times  watched all the movies many times  including on Christmas when we watched all 3 extended editions in a row   and he was really looking forward to the series. I got around to asking him if he plans to watch it 2 days ago  and he looked at me like I offered him some dog dung ice cream lol. he s still gonna watch it  but he s on some industrial strength copium.
imagine the look on frodo and sam s faces  after getting the ring to mordor  to find out they could have re-rolled their class at any time.
galadriel was a mage  period. on top of that  yes she might be athletic  but its in a graceful dancer type way. she majestically moves about. she doesnt brute force things like a thug.
they really think that fans  that are immersed in the lore of the tolkien universe  dont know the backstory of the series  give me a break! they are just trying to ride on the coat tails of the author  and trying to convince us that they know better than us.
thank u so much  3the video in which you mentioned that galadriel would never allow an ordinary human to touch her hair  that was such an important message to grasp the character of galadriel.unfortunately  this scene is pushed out of the trailer by other criticism  but when I saw it  it was a stab in my heart  galadriel is my favorite character in the whole tolkien universe.
bounding into comics had an article where amazon admitted they only had the rights to the hobbit  fellowship of the ring  the two towers and the return of the king only. they do not have the rights to the silmarillion nor any of the 2nd age stories. so why are they trying to do stories about the 2nd age  now we know why they ve changed so much. they dont want to tell a lotr story. they want to cash off of the lotr name only. disgusting.
amazon is really gonna try to make galadriel into another daenerys targaryen from game of thrones.
Im not religious but I appreciate that you do a Bible verse in each video. props to you for being yourself and saying eff the haters! also  amazon s prime-ring is going to be hilarious. they should market it as a comedy satire and I bet it ll do amazing!
galadriel in  the rings of power  is still already 7000 years old.  elves mature in tolkien s world at around 70 in human years  so her young wild non-level-headed times are still roughly 6  millennium behind her.  not to mention she never took part in any of the earlier ages  wars because  well  elves are kinda above all of that by this point.
definitely mage! she was hotheaded in valinor! its why she left. but Im sure the march across the helcaraxe turned that fire into  cold  resolve. that being said  one thing I noticed about her in the books was her penchant for disappearing right before the shtf  no doubt due to her foresight. which annoyed me as a kid b c she never warned anyone!
beautifully made video! one of my favorite parts of the hobbit movies was when galadriel came with elrond and saruman to dol guldur. she isn t wearing armor  or even any shoes  yet she swats an orc with her magic into the next dimension as if it was a fly. this was before doing the same with sauron. that was absolutely amazing  but it also made complete sense! imagine how badass amazon could have made her  if only they stuck with her actual class. they re too blinded with being  woke  to see all of the potential in their laps.
a mage totally wears an armor and carries a sword  dont they    do you not understand how mages work !
ugh  the elves  as a whole  were not hot headed. they re effectively immortal  and think in timeframes of centuries. the exception  there are always exceptions  was glorfindel  who died in the first age  was reborn  and came back to middle-earth. goldenboy could fight balrogs on even ground.
and we all know wearing armour decreases magic ability!
powerful mage  influential person  mighty politician. seems not enough lol
read this  galadriel was not some house lady..  ... she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the noldor  she was strong of body  mind  and will  a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the eldar in the days of their youth. and ... being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the valar thought fit to give the eldar ...
@thomas k   even banishing sauron to barad-d r years prior to the fellowship s establishment isn t important enough for them.
@alexander mordekai  what that has to do with this  I showed you text where galadriel is literally described as very tall  strong and equal athlete and skilled to any eldar..
@tr1x 24  quoting ebenezer from the comments above while galadriel was described as having amazonian tendencies in her youth and competing athletically with the males of her kind  this is something that is said to have applied in her youth. elves are also described as basically changing their worldview and sentiments after they had lived a few hundred years and started feeling the burden  malice and evil in arda. the rings of power was set in the 2nd age  young galadriel was in the first age.
@tr1x 24  and yet that does not imply she had to wore full plate armour and chase the baddies wth a sword. she was strong in the same sense than luthien  who was not described as a battlemage by jrr tolkien.
it also completely misunderstands the constant underlying theme that tolkien infuses in his characters. pure power especially in physical form or combat skills is not what makes any of the good or bad characters important and impactful. even characters like aragorn ultimately change the fate of middle earth thru their non-combat based characteristics. aragorn could have never stopped sauron with his sword alone. his intelligence  honestly  integrity and love for his friends and his final acceptance of his responsibility as a leader is what helped defeat sauron...not stabbing orcs. galadriel is insanely important and powerful without even needing to wield a sword at all. slapping some armor on her and having her be a  hot headed warrior  actually undermines her influence.
people forget that men can be mages too I guess. and that mages are fucking terrifying and powerful af. I think mage galadriel is actually a lot scarier and badass than common af warrior galadriel but whatever. these people are nuts and dont understand fantasy.
galadriel s mother name is literally nerwen.  you do know that  dont you
yes! yes! and yes!
from what I remember about the youth of the elves. they mature from youth to adulthood at the age of 70  or maybe at age 50 . while galadriel was described as having amazonian tendencies in her youth and competing athletically with the males of her kind  this is something that is said to have applied in her youth. elves are also described as basically changing their worldview and sentiments after they had lived a few hundred years and started feeling the burden  malice and evil in arda. this new galadriel looks kinda young  imo. at the time she went from lindonto ost-in-edhil she was more than 2000 years old. remember  the first age was the longest and she was born in the years of the trees before the sun and moon. she still had the fire of the old days in her  and no  that doesnt mean she was a fighter or warrior at all. from the first age on she thought that fighting against morgoth was futile and she used her power to seal her people off from evil and defend her realms . she got most of her magical powers from melian in menegroth and later from nenya.I just cant see tolkien in that new amazon show. before I watch something that meddles with my memories by taking names from tolkien s books and giving them to some who just dont portray what tolkien s descriptions suggest and state  Imuch rather dont watch it.elrond with short hair  not elrond  imo. finrod with short hair and looking like he just turned 18  he was a wise king  not a fighter. while this finrod doesnt look like a fighter in the teaser which they got correct  he doesnt look like a wise king but a scared teenager. galadriel s hair is described as shining golden and silvern at the same time. even feanor wanted a strand of her beautiful hair  which she didn t give him since she didn t like him. galadriel s hair in that teaser looks just bland.to top that  amazon wants to compress the story  which will probably span from galadriel s journey from lindonto which will become ost-in-edhil  the establishment of the  kingdom  of eregion  until its destruction by sauron or maybe just until galadriel leaves eregion with celeborn  tbh. I cant tell  since I haven t heard anything from amazon about the time span  the time in which these things take place is at least 700 s.a. to 1200 s.a. they will very likely compress it to less than a human lifespan. which again takes the epicness of tolkien s stories away. again  I cant say that for sure but why would amazon care to not do it if you guys want to correct me  please do that as I will gladly go back to the source material to learn more and correct myself
plus they dont even understand what with amazon disposition tolkien meant....I am pretty sure that he didnt meant her character but her body skill set..cos I know a lot about amazon myth and legends and they were very ruthless and cold blooded they even killing their own babes without hesitation if they were male...I cant see these characteristics in galadriel I cant think that if someone argued with her she will instantly kill him just because he had different opinion...cos amazons were like that..... galadriel just wasnt like that plain and simple...so it is bullshit to say that galadriel was similar to amazons as a character...
@angel kon  very good addition  thank you I too understood it that way in the sense of her being athletic and strong of body  competing in sports with the male elves
I always read it as in her youth she was interested in exercise and well-being rather than study and lady like pastimes not thatshe was learning to be xena warrior princess
the really sad thing is that a man who held professroships in anglo-saxon and english language and literature wouldn t have been very precise and careful in his word choice.
except it doesnt. noldor are pretty tough boys if you know your tolkien a bit  and she s pretty much the oldest in the middle earth. she doesnt have to be  badass in her own way   she can be badass in all ways. old elves are op  thats all.
@bones12x2  dont talk about what you dont know. for tolkien  physical power  and  magic  are often intertwined  especially in elves. he does not snob physicall prowess at all.
@8smoker8  you completely missed my point. we re not talking about tolkien s understanding of his own ideas.  we re talking about the show runners injecting their own opinions of a powerful wahmen... aka... one that acts like a man.
@bones12x2  if such injection works with tolkien s vision  idgaf. you sound obsessed threatened.
@alexander mordekai  you cans till be a house lady and be strong.
sword fighting is feminine
yeah that is dope. not at all like the cookie cutter mindless crap elsewhere
well yes  lotr was written before the whole mage thief warrior trichotomy anyways  so its hard to fit into those categories. I d still argue she s a mage  because philosophically a mage is the insert for us nerds with lots of book learning  and the magic can be seen as the power granted to them from their knowledge. lots of mages get their magic from ancient sources  or arcane tomes.philosophy aside though  from an everyman s perspective  hobbits   all elves had innate  elven magic   so I d classify her as a mage type. remember their gift for healing  foresight  the ability to feel what is coming in the future   and the enchanting presence galadriel has. sure they had ability in crafting  but to craft magical items implies innate magical ability. yes  a loremaster might be more accurate  but itseems more like a subcategory.showrunners still got it all wrong  no matter how you look at it.
to be fair its also implied though that galadriel s powers were so weird and diverse that even saruman didn t fully understand the extent of what she could actually do. if anyone else could be compared to the true wizards  its her
galadriel is married to celeborn  whom she ruled with. celebrimbor was the ringmaker.
@captain sarina  magic in tolkiens universe is not how people think of magic in most fantasy books or games.
@minuette  Im fully aware of that. Im not talking about throwing giant fireballs
well she is one of the most uniteresing characters  because of insuficient background data  oh and she is a fuckg elf. make no mistake here.
@david po  if you play lotro  she s equivalent to a loremaster
magic in tolkien s world doesnt work like it does in other fantasy. sorry  no abracadabra  no magic wands. tolkien even says this. different beings had a certain amount of strength that was native to them. the older elves who lived under the two trees were powerful because of that  and because they lived in the presence of the valar and learned from them. galadriel s hair was even said to capture the gold and silver light of the two trees  and was perhaps the very thing which inspired f anor to craft the silmarils in the first place. f anor also was unable to destroy the silmarils as it would kill him. his name meant  spirit of fire . being the mightiest of all elves ever born  he was able to craft the mightiest objects of all elves  the silmarils  because part of himself passed into them  which is also why breaking them would kill him. it is exactly the same thing as the relationship between sauron and the one ring. the ring was imbued with sauron s spirit  which sought to dominate the wills of others. destroying the ring destroyed sauron. when gandalf fought and killed the balrog in moria  he only did it at the cost of his own life. the very act of killing the balrog destroyed him. in fact  every named character in tolkien s works who kills a balrog  dies in the effort. confronting the balrog at the door in moria also nearly destroyed gandalf. this all reads almost like an adaptation of newtonian physics. it takes an equal and opposite force to overcome something like a balrog. some of the more powerful elves could do it  but it killed them. its not really magic. its the application of what they are into what they are doing. its why the things they create are so incredible and unusual. why sam s elven rope was able to come untied when he jerked on the end of it. its why when they tell stories  you can almost see the story unfold like a spectator. its why all the things they do are so much more extraordinary than those same things done by mortals. thats their magic in tolkien s world  not fire and light shooting out of their fingers. galadriel couldn t do any of that. she had wisdom gained from thousands of years of life and even learned from the valar themselves in aman  as well as melian in menegroth. she lived under the light of the two trees and suffered many sorrows. she also didn t squander her native power in vain pursuits  but used it to preserve  council  and minister to others. thats why she s still so powerful in the third age. morgoth sewed his malice into the very fabric of arda  which caused him to diminish over time. by the end of the first age  he was diminished to the point that he was locked into corporeal form. he could not recover from injuries and was maimed by fingolfin and scarcely more powerful in his being than some of the greater maiar.

this comment made my day  thanks.
she s like a cha   int build with over 90  stats in pj s trilogy and hobbits.
lol
she s not a mage or a warrior  thats d d and wow nonsense. she s a calaquendI who was born in valinor. she beheld the light of the two trees and was mentored by melian the maia for 500 years. enough with the mage and warrior nonsense. this isn t a video game. this is a rich mythology with actual deep seeded languages and explanations. let s give the professor the respect he deserves.
@sean hartel  some people really need to make an easy explanation hard just to flaunt their brain  do they  I know who  what  and how she become what she is now - and give an example in the easiest  more normie-friendly  close-to-lore  why its out of character for her to be...that in trop  something that the even creator of trop fail to grasp and decided to screw it anyway. tell those people to respect him  not me. and btw  some video games takes inspiration from lotr lore and myth  and clearly respect their source material  so its not a nonsense. we gamers would accept  class-changes  of a character  be it in movie or a story  if there s a lore or anything that indicates that  not a  fanfic  like trop ...heck  there s a japanese ln about this  a high elf spiritsummoner who got bored and decided to spend his time learning smithing  swordmanship  cooking and more. and each of them are told close to 10  chapter each  about 10 years each in the novel   not just a passing mention. its more believable than a warrior galadriel  any mention of this  by tolkien himself or a quote passed from him
someone just suggested a battle mage. even then...
lol  I love this comment. so based. 100 percent agree!
@mimicinabox  I agree  the rings of power is total fan fiction crap. its basically cosplay and beyond the scope of adaptation. I know gaming draws inspiration from lotr  but if a company is going to spend 1 billion dollars on an  adaptation  planned for 5 season and are claiming to respect the source material  I think people should know that there s no such thing as a mage in tolkien s world. its something completely different.
@sean hartel   in mythological times they had mages n warriors that weld light magic n dark mage and she s an high elf the most royal n prestige elf in the elven hiearchy
@sean hartel  agree the ring of power is a tumblr dumpster fire
bb b b b bb you can in dragon quest
@sean hartel  well lore wise she is known as one of the strongest magic users  but your right about this class rubbish. still she wouldnt have much need for a sword. swords are of no more use here.
well Imean you could  but you d piss off the fan base and have to be crazy to- oh.
@funky town monkey pimps  well considering she had no part with the fall she shouldnt even be in the show.
@mimicinabox  bruh there s ln s about every imaginable thing. like  ghost rider in twilight! steal women from your family! esper harem in the apocalypse! arrogant young masters chat group! mutant farmer in the apocalypse! losing money to be a tycoon! these titles are... amazing.
exactly.
@mimicinabox  no  I dont think its out of character for her to be a warrior. but its out of character for her  as one among the mightiest elves  to be humiliated by someone touching her precious hair  which she refused even when f anor asked.
@sean hartel  mage is almost certainly a class in middle earth role play  dude  not just d and d..
the Lord of the rings isn t a video game at all.
ahem she multI classed lol  idk view it as non cannon and just enjoy the ride babies nothing compares to tolkeins books
even in fire emblem very few characters can do that.
galadriel s  class  is not mage nor warrior. its noldo. and she s a very high level at it. elves dont need classes  they can do it all.
gud one
I am rolling! but actually though...
she also spent a ton of time in valinor  studying from the valar. tolkien mentions her in zero battles.
@guntcheck  he mentions one instance of physical combat. galadriel is said to have fought fiercely against the feanoreans at the first kinslaying.
galadriel also crossed the helcaraxe and took part in the battle that feanor was killed in. or at least was there. tolkien describes young galadriel as having amazonian qualities so this depiction of galadriel when she was younger isn t totally against lore.
@jake ervin  tho she was 2k yrs old by then hardly yung
@jake ervin  except that in this timeline  it would have made sense if it was celeborn  her husband  rather than galadriel. so if my guess is right  galadriel would not even be married in this series nor would she have a daughter name celebrian  heck maybe even have a fling with halbrand...
@warren peace  yeah I hope not. galadriel and celeborn should be married and have had celebrain at this point. but I am pretty sure they dont have access to unfinished tales which is where all that information is given. I dont know how much about galadriel and celeborn is told in the appendices.
@tar-elenion maranwe  I am not sure if I remember correctly  but the noldor under feanor have weapons but the telerI do not  other than hunting bows... so if galadriel fought  it is highly doubtful thatshe used a sword.
@jake ervin  the rings of power is not even following the appendices  at least based on what they have said... case in point  war galdadriel and architect elrond is certainly not found in it.. I am sure that the appendices have the story between celeborn and galadriel but I am not clear as to how specifically it was told.
@warren peace  that is correct. the version with galadriel fighting is not in the silmarillion. rather it comes in late manuscripts that tolkien was working on  but that Christopher did not use  for various reasons of no import here  when editing together the silmarillion from manuscripts written over the course of 50  years by his father. what tolkien conceived of her using to fight with is not known.I imagine that an oar  or boat hook  or frying pan or rolling pin would have been readily obtainable if not a spear  tolkien noted that elf-women did not take up arms except in dire need and desperate defence.the  amazonian qualities   actually  amazon disposition  is how tolkien put it  the other person you are having a conversation with mentions  is from a letter in which tolkien notes thatshe would bind up her hair and partake in athletic feats  in her youth in valinor   and relates to that. it does not say anything about her as a warrior.
front line you are correct no she wouldn t but that doesnt mean she would sit back and let her enemies run amok her people  I  would reckon she would nuke her enemies with her magic since she was a hell of a powerful magic user
@jake ervin  no  galadriel neither took part in nor was there for the battle feanor died in.that battle took place before the other noldor made it to beleriand.
@18  hot  galadriel reached her prime age by the end of the third age. before that  she could be considered young.
@ eugene  there s a huge difference between 200 years young  and 2000 years  young . for elves childhood and adolescence ends at the 100th year. then they are fully grown  so after that they are adults. in adulthood they become consistently more and more weary of the world and burdened by its sorrows. it is possible thatshe might have had that youth like amazon disposition in what would be her young adulthood  maybe for a few hundred years  maybe even for 500-1000 years. but at 2000  with all the burdens and weariness  not likely.
@marcus  you ll have to challenge tolkien then  not me. ask him why galadriel a then one thousand and three hundred years old  at least in one of the versions  elf was eager to go into exile so she could rule a kingdom of her own. the elves didn t perceive time as we do. five hundred years were but  a little while  to legolas. why do you think another five hundred years since the exile would have made galadriel weary of the world.in the silmarillion  it is said  after the war of wrath  even though the they were  admitted again   galadriel chose to stay in middle-earth  because she wasn t  willing to forsake the hither lands  - so still not quite weary right
tell your dad to save his sanity and just ignore this series in its entirety. not my first  shitty remake rodeo  and its better if you didn t see it in the first place.
actually  they could have re-rolled their races and genders nowadays.
in the upcoming woke lotr reboot the fellowship just identifies as orcs and sues their way into mordor.
@mungeparty
I feel  thatshe was written with that in mind. she was one of the characters from whom we follow the passage of time within the story. to muck her character up is to do the same with others... and thus the whole story.you could say her character is one of the pillars of the silmarillion

emilia clarke actually looks more like an elf then the new galadriel actress  especially with her got wig
thank you  thats what Ive saying.
dude wait till varda elberet and tinuviel get in the waterfall. and the waterfall us actually yavnna. some sick action there.
danny has a reason for how she is  galadriel grew out of that thousands of years ago
@phil  would rather see that tbh
that doesnt mean she cannot fight  here from unfinished tails   ... she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the noldor  she was strong of body  mind  and will  a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the eldar in the days of their youth. and ... being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the valar thought fit to give the eldar ...
@tr1x 24  why does having a strong body mean you can fight where in the literature does she pick up a sword and strike someone with it  in a battle
@mechminded  did you even read those lines and yes she did fight   even after the merciless assault upon the telerI and the rape of their ships  though she fought fiercely against f anor in defence of her mother s kin  she did not turn back.
@tr1x 24  can fight  doesnt mean  would will  fight.  and the era of f anor  galadriel s uncle  is far before this series  and would ve placed a younger galadriel in the series  but this isn t that time period.  this is 6 900 years after that period.
@tr1x 24  did you even read my question !1 where was a sword mentioned in what you quoted
@mechminded     what you mean  that he should specifically wrote  galadriel fought fiercely with her sword  lmao..
@tr1x 24  do I think if tolkein gave a sword to one of his most notable characters that he would mention it  yes  given he names the weapons of others.does fighting fiercely require martial arts  no. she could have cast inherent magic on her foes  or fired a bow.you are stretching.
@mechminded  you are stretching    I can just as easily say that why then tolkien didn t wrote that galadriel fight with magic  do we even know that they fight with magic in valinor  galadriel is pretty much none factor in 1st and 2nd ages  theres no stories about her  so why would he give her a sword
@tr1x 24  yes you could do more stretching - but I have done none. I am not the one arguing for something that isn t in the text - but simply referring to the text and absences in the text to point out your stretch. why would he give her a sword   he didn t. so why are you supporting the idea
@mechminded  yea sure  its more logically that they fighted with swords then magic  if I remember correctly  tolkien never described any elves doing magic on battlefield neither in valinor or against morgoth.. but yea  when galadriel fights  she must use magic  because tolkien didn t specifically wrote thatshe was using sword..because he didn t wrote any story about galadriel  we only know where she was  we dont know what she was doing  why would he give her a sword if he didn t write about her  why he didn t give cirdan a sword  celebrimbor  celeborn etc. same reasons  those characters are just mentioned  they are not in stories where you need to name weapons for story purposes  does that means that those characters didn t use swords  no..
@tr1x 24  we are talking lore  not logic. what is supported in the lore  and what is not. motivated inference is what amazon has done in part  or lore-breaking adaptation in other parts.
@mechminded  well lore is full of  time holes   for certain characters we dont know what are they doing for few thousands of years  but that doesnt mean they are doing nothing.
@tr1x 24  it does not mean you get to hamfist something into that hole.
@tr1x 24  she studied with the miar and valar  they all used magic of some sort. the show is making her as the commander of the northern army which is ludicrous!
@tr1x 24   tolkien never described any elves doing magic on battlefield neither in valinor or against morgoth .  galadriel s brother dueled sauron with a song of power  otherwise known as magic  in --of beren and luthien  qs  pg. 170-171  the silmarillion. so not against morgoth per se but against his lieutenant  sauron.
@erelasinglor  I was talking  on battlefield   finrod had 1vs1 vs sauron.not saying thatsome powerful elves didn t use magic  they prob did  but it was from context where people here said that galadriel fight with magic and not sword bow in kinslaying  which doesnt has to be  it is only said thatshe fight.
@tr1x 24  I think it is a far stretch to think that even if she fought in the kinslaying  and even if it was a sword she used  that this makes accepting her as a warrior and commander of the  northern armies  in the 2nd age of amazon s show valid.  tolkien is explicit in how he treated galadriel s character  and while no doubt he had different renditions  not fully accepted in the larger works  of how she left aman and with whom  it is clear cut regarding her lack of battlefield participation in the wars of arda. her role as a superior counselor  wife  ring-bearer  mother  and queen is always the motif.  the way tolkien wrote  if he didn t state it  there is no exception to lack of inscription unless Christopher thought his father s intent otherwise.
that wasnt even hot headed like they are doing.
@brad dl  well she was before melian tempered her
she used her foresight to guide others to fulfill their destinies and usher in the next age as the time of the eldar was coming to an end. thats why she bounced before shtf. the gifts. the suttle nudges of courage   resolve. thatsaid  she didn t know what might come past a certain point in time  but she knew enough to guide them and what things  needed to take place to reach that point.
@thetinlion  that actually makes no sense - but sure. why not. but you will never convince my 12 year old self that thats what happened.
@raggmopp 3377  how does that not make sense  think about what she was doing as being akin to what dr. strange did in avengers infinity war....he took steps that put the surviving avengers on the best path to beating thanos   saving everyone.
@thetinlion  12 year old me  actually  14 by the time I got to the silmarillion  would like to remind you thatshe left doriath - which was destroyed. she left beleriand - and then it was destroyed and her dad was there. she left ost-in-edhil - a city she founded - and then it was destroyed. and to top it off  she goes to lorinand shortly before all hell broke loose and oh looky! she s now the defacto queen. and  oddly  she never  saw  her daughter s attack and wounding forcing her to leave  yeeaah. not buying it. she may have been wise  but she was also ambitious and mightily self interested. thats just my opinion.
I think they re trying to multi-class her into eldritch knight. maybe with 4 levels of rogue for the sneak attack damage and 2 levels of paladin for the saving throw bonus.
unless they re a battle mage
@pazza corone  one of those amazon types  I suppose.
to be fair  sauron is depicted wearing full armor in the opening scene and gandaf carries a sword  too.I agree  they dont understand how magic works  but wearing armor nor carrying a sword isn t a no go for a magic character
@snygg  sauron is primal spirit which was more of a warrior  rouge even  in the time he was active officer of his God. the fact that he holds mystical powers is more natural akin to dragons being able to breathe fire.as for gandalf - he was considered odd-ball by other wizards for a reason. it has to do with many things one of which is the fact that in early story he pretty much is all but confirmed to be weakest maiar out of 5 wizards  yes  radagast is stronger mage than gandalf the grey . so he more or less became sort of battle-mage to make up for what he lacked in raw power. he was also a bit of a rouge as he learned minor  tricks  for very same reason of covering his weak points. this archetype was later used in dnd in form of elminster aumar who was also versed in swordfighting and trickery. none of those however ever plated themselves in a full set of armor as it would hinder them. in other words  having a nice mystical sword is an asset and ais to a mage who knows how to use it  but encasing yourself in something that without immense physical strength would only made you a living target and might possibly mess with your magic - that is a big no no.
@dan dare  you are really deep into thatstuff  aren t you thanks for giving the background to my argument
@snygg  np and my pleasure.I certainly like to talk on this topic as battlemage in general is epic archetype  if told well  and both gandalf and elminster are pretty much my fave characters in their respective stories involving them
its almost as if you ve never heard of battle or fighter mages in fantasy novels and rpgs..
ever heard of battlemages  her noldor racial traits cover for everything she needs.
thatstill makes sense though. glorfindel  warrior    galadriel  mage     maglor  bard     legolas  archer     thranduil  king     elrond  lore-master.
imagine the scene from the movie when boromir says  one does not simply walk in-to mordor..  then glorfindel suddenly shows up..  challenge accepted!  .. kek
@lorelei  he was originally considered to be part of the fellowship of the ring  but it was ultimately decided that he wouldn t be suited for the role. glorfindel was the epitome of  morgoth f-d around and found out.  even death couldn t keep him out of messing with the shadow s plans.
@raggmopp 3377  that whole family.  lol
this isn t exactly true  hotheadedness was a pretty common trait among the noldor of which galadriel was part. the silmarillion says galadriel willingly took part in the f anor s rebellion against the valar because she wanted to see the wild lands of middle earth and find a domain of her own to rule. so she had some kind of adventurous hotheaded prideful streak in her  whatever you want to call it. but this doesnt justify making her a warrior princess of course.
@a person  yeah - feanor pretty much told melkor to get off his lawn and slammed the door in his face.  snicker
the noldor were quite hot headed.
right! I learned that from runescape
robert e. howad s conan novels taught me that the magic is most effective when wearing nothing at all...
galadriel had been a pupil of aul  and yavanna in valinor. and later she spent basically whole first age with melian in doriath who mentors her. melian who is well know for her enchanting songs  you know.what do amazon think they had teached her  sword wielding  we know for a fact who s her teachers was during the years of the trees and first age and what exactly they specialized  and how she was portrayed in the third age. not a hard logical conclusion to make to fill the gap.concerning galadriel brothers   they all died in 455 fa and 465 fa respectively. its more than one hundred years have passed already  125 to be precise  at the begining of second age. and now she is mad all of a sudden and want revenge  to whom I dare to ask  morgoth was defeated and sauron have fled without trace.and  by the way  galadriel never took part in any battles of the first age. what exactly multiple attack does she survive  what the hell they a talking about and please  explain me one more thing. elves are immortal. their spirits immortal. they are bound to arda. they all returning in the halls of mandos and after that can be reincarnated or resurected exept the bad ones  like feanor. soon after she return to valinor she will meet her brothers and she know it. so  whats the point in rage and revenge  its humans feelings  it doesnt apply to elves. they might be saddend for sure because of a long separation  but rage and revenge  what for  amazon stripped tolkiens elves race from their unique culture  their hair and their philosophy  diminished it to some modern dudes from starbucks. what a noncence.
one of the things I love about God of war 4 is how natural the changes felt from norse mythology. it felt organic and not forced. every change they are making here just feels like they are disrespecting tolkien and are just trying to check certain boxes.
describing an approximately 3000 year old  demI God   as someone else described elves on a different video  in tolkien s world who was born in the years of the trees and who lived through the wars of the first age  actual wars with Gods and the changing of the world then a couple of thousand years of the second age as  young and hot-headed  is so insane it has to be a joke.
great video! I really kinda feel like hurin  a man that got trapped on a mountain by morgoth  overseeing the realms of men  so hurin had to watch morgoth destroy the entire realm of men. in this case  the realm of men is tolkiens lore and amazon is morgoth
ign has a new article where a  lore expert  claims that tolkien never wrote that female dwarves had beards.  people started posting this  in the war of the jewels   the later quenta silmarillion  of the naugrim and the edain   written  1951   tolkien wrote that  ...no man nor elf has ever seen a beardless dwarf - unless he were shaven in mockery  and would then be more like to die of shame... for the naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives  male and female alike... lol
the  hot-headed  galadriel might have worked if there series was set in the early days of the first age of the sun and before even that  i.e during the the rebellion of the noldor when she was the  only female to stand tall in those days .  but between then and the second age she has spend nearly 600 years in doriath  where it is my understanding thatshe learnt sorcery from melian and statesmanship from thingol.  and by the time of the forging of the rings of power she is around 5 000 years old  so hardly young and  hot headed  by anyone s standard.  meanwhile legolas was a mere 2 931 years old  according to the one source I could find  at the time of the fellowship of the ring.also in all the amazon clips there is no mention of her husband  celeborn  or her daughter  celebrain.  where I cannot find a year of birth for celebrain  all that I can find is thatshe was born sometime in the second age   she was old enough to marry elrond in the year 109 of the third age  with their sons elladan and elrohir being born in 130  and her daughter arwen in 241.  this means that arwen was 2 778 years old when she married aragorn.  if celebain was a similar age  say 2500 when she married elrond  this would put her birth around the year 1 200 of the second age  give or take a couple of hundred years   making her a mere 300 when work starts on the rings of power  and 400 when the one ring is forged.  galadriel does not strike me as the type of person who would leave her  young  daughter to go off adventuring.  note that I acknowledge that these numbers could be out by hundreds of years.as for the armour and weapons  for me a galadriel of the second age would not use such items  not because she cannot  but more because she does not need them.  never mind that for anyone who knows how historical armour works  the armour she is shown wearing is that bad it looks like cheap fancy dress armour.
galadriel was born in the 1364 in the years of the trees  the age that preceded the first age. all the lore  such as the kinslaying a civil war between elves   this is where they get the warrior princess idea because it is said thatshe fought fiercely in defense of her kin . the crossing  the helcarax  by fingolfin and his followers including galadriel all happened at this time. a full 750 years before the events of the second age even began and 2100 years before the forging of the rings  which happened in 1500 s.a. by this time she was over 2000 years old and quite weary having seen all her brothers killed in battle through the ages  she was much like the person we see in the fellowship by this time  not a young and brash warrior but an old soul full wisdom  grief and regret.
they took one quote where tolkien described her as athletic and used that to turn the most powerful woman in me into xena the warrior princess.
agreed. from what ive seen  the jack of all trades  master of none is very foundational principle to rpgs  fantasy and quest stories. to specialize and work around ones limitations is a key part of storytelling. when there are no tradeoffs  it can hamper the audiences ability to appreciate their struggle.
good to see actual fans of lotr and tolkien drop b-52 truth bombs on this amazon fan fiction alternate universe. its absurd to believe they could adopt a 5 season series from 150 pages of appendices. it ll be fun to not watch this billion dollar failure.
really like your energy and your opinions. I also like that you aren t afraid to say you are Christian. I hope your channel grows to be huge ! I see good things here and look at the engagement not quite 20k subs and right now I see almost 450 comments thats a damn sight better than a lost of bigger channels. keep pluggin away and I know you ll do well.  regarding the series there s no freakin way I will watch this revisionist tolkien stuff.  and besides I haven t given bezos a dime of my money so Im not starting nowps  after looking at the pics of warrior galadriel its really given me a renewed appreciation for peter jackson and cate blanchetts vision of galadriel
Im not quite sure if its the same in english  but in german being compared to an amazon warrior usually means looking like one  not being a fierce fighter. and this seems to align with galadriel as she is described as man-maiden because she is tall and athletic  not because she s constantly fighting someone.
in my readings of lotr  and the silmarillion... I dont remember galadriel being mage  or warrior. I suppose I will be looking back through them again. a leader  an elven lady with one of the three rings of power thatsauron meant to use in enslaving elves to his will. she used it to enchant lothlorien  to give her people a safe forest to remain in  until it would no longer be possible  or there was no need for it anymore. like the pool she let frodo look into  and the gift she gave him which stored the star light to aid him  she definitely had some ability as a seer perhaps  but mostly used artifacts thatstored elven magic.
question  is galadriel ever described as wearing armor in tolkien  s lore  and two  is she ever described as leading an army into battle  thats all I want to know.
its really dumb. making galadriel into a warrior makes her less powerful than being a mage.think of the two towers and when aragorn  legolas and gimlI were hunting for the orcs who kidnapped merry and pippin. they had an encounter with a  white wizard  in. thinking it was saruman  they tried to make ready for a battle against a mage  and they were all visibly intimidated by the prospect.and when all three tried to coordinate an attack  gandalf the white just negated all of their efforts with a gesture.if a wizard can easily just swat aside the attacks from top tier human  elven and dwarf warriors like that  its pretty clear that mages are more powerful than any warriors of the setting.
according to the encyclopedia of arda  galadriel met her future husband celeborn before the war of wrath at the end of the first age. so unless all these scenes of galadriel without celeborn were flashbacks from the first age  it appears the show s writers paid no respect to canon. and it is important to maintain the canon for galadriel  for she was one of the two greatest of the eldar  the other being faenor. and this makes her one of the most important and most respected leaders of middle earth.
I didn t like much of what was show about this fanfic  I liked n menor and durin iv   but I have to say warrior galadriel is one of the smallest problems about it  because that letter from tolkien and a passage in the silmarillion opened a breach  in that passage it is stated that  she fought fiercely in defence of her motherkin against feanor   we dont know if she literally fought or just argued against it  its unclear but oppened the breach.
considering the fact galadriel was born in the yt 79  year of the tree  and the point in the 2nd age amazon is dealing with  she is over 2 000 years old. galadriel was an accomplished mage long before the 2nd age. but since amazon is already compressing the timeline why not have a  teenage  galadriel posing as  zena  the warrior princess !
I believe the misunderstanding that young galadriel might have been a warrior is the descriptions made of her during the first age. in the encyclopedia of arda  it was mentioned that  because of her stature and her strength of will  her mother earwen gave her another name  nerwen  meaning  man-maiden  . but why did the writers and producers want to visualize a  man-maiden  as someone who needed to have an armor. are they trying to portray galadriel as their image of joan of arc  why cant a  man-maiden  be more like grace o malley  a mother-queen who had more the disposition of a wife and mother than an armored warrior. but she has been known to easily dispatch any male warrior if properly motivated. a strong female that is an equal of any warrior male does not need muscles nor armor.
galaldriel could take the one ring from frodo  walk into mordor  kick sauron into the void  and rule middle-earth without picking up a sword  because magic. but she had a test to pass and all  and didn t want to be evil. and elrond as an architect  really !
you cant just say elves lack human emotions and tendencies while also bringing up faenor and his kin.  edit  I agree with you for the most part. its just that one discrepancy.
@alex durain  well  feanor wasn t rage about finw  death. his death was sad  of course  but thats not the reason. feanor s rage was about his stolen creation  silmarils. something  he would never able recreate. oath was about silmarils.
@dumbcyanide  Im reading the silmarillion right now. faenor loved the silmaril  but the book makes it clear that he loved his father most. lets say Im wrong though. are greed  rage  and vengeance not human traits
@alex durain  of course he loved his father. but the oath was not about him  but about silmarils only. Im talking about causation. for elves and for galadriel specifically be vengeful about finrod s death was meaningles. because elve s f a are immortal and bound to arda. elves perception of death differently from humans. for human being vengeful for fallen comrades more common trait. same with fingolfin btw. he did t go full rage mode on only because of death of his comrades  but because he lost hope and felt despair  because everything was in vain. you see  its sometimes looks like human traits  but with different premise to it. you can felt more what Im trying to say if youread  athrabeth finrod ah andreth  from morgoth s ring.
@dumbcyanide  I ll check it out. thx for the recommendation
another dumb comment referring to elves as demiGods when a whole monarchy of Gods existed in valinor and answered to a one God.  this is pretty blasphemous  especially to how tolkien described his characters and was quite religious.
@be1mont  I didn t refer to elves as demiGods. I quoted someone else calling them demiGods  the point being to highlight how even people discussing or arguing the subject on youtube perceive their gravitas. yes  I know there is a whole backstory of Gods  I have read the silmarillion countless times.
@be1mont  an immortal and magical being  various elves have power and abilities  able to be reincarnated.  demi-God is certainly an understandable description.
@johnnyzenith  I find it very funny thatso many people are angry about bastardizing lore and this dude is making it up as he goes.
I wanted to know if middle earth female dwarfs had beards yesterday. it took me maybe 5 min of googling to find that quote.who does zero research before denying something publicly
@donovan jarvis  research is battle of helm s deep-hard for them.
@donovan jarvis  professional liars
when I came to think of it  in my own imagination  beards were not found among hobbits  as stated in the text   nor among the eldar  not stated . all male dwarves had them.   the nature of middle earth  italics present in the original text thatseems to imply that at least some female dwarves didn t have beards. you know  tolkien kept rewriting his stories and contradicting himself until the very end of his life. he even said at some point that there were no female dwarves. for many things you can find arguments for both sides. there just isn t one single universal truth.
@tombomthefreemason  I know tolkien said other races believed that no female dwarfs existed  thats where the myth that dwarfs were born from stone came from. never saw anything about them not existing beyond that. Im no lotr expert though. I found implications about the beards both ways while researching  thats why I didn t stop until I found evidence one way. that guy considers himself a lotr expert though. shouldn t he have read all the books and known  I find it hard to imagine you d forget a big detail like a race with bearded women.
@donovan jarvis I agree  its a little weird that he forgot about that  but then again  the quote that everyone is referring to is a very small passage from a pretty obscure book  while the one that I cited comes from a fairly recent book  so he probably read that one not long ago and got the idea that female dwarves definitely didn t have beards. again  he s wrong about that  but there s no definite answer  so the people saying the opposite are as wrong as him.I dont pretend to be a tolkien expert myself  but Im just saying we should keep in mind that the legendarium was in constant evolution and that tolkien never arrived with a  finished  version.
@tombomthefreemason  its understandable that people make mistakes. just seems like a self proclaimed expert should be held to a certain standard. there is one definite answer though. I didn t find any passage saying female dwarfs were beardless. implications are not direct contradictions.
@donovan jarvis I never said all female dwarves were beardless  I said that the passage from nome strongly implies that at least some of them were. why would tolkien make the words male dwarves italics if all female dwarves had beards and I wouldn t call corey olsen  self-proclaimed   he s a very well known tolkien scholar. but to be fair what he said about the beards was a mistake and should have been at the very least worded differently.
@tombomthefreemason  right  and I said an implication does not contradict fact.  for the naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives  male and female alike... maybe there was further context to explain why he specified male dwarfs  if I say  all men have body hair  that does not mean women do not. men might just be the topic. apologies if Imisunderstood.you said there was no definite answer to bearded females right there is confirmation  quote above .if you are discrediting that then I assumed you had proof denying bearded females.otherwise how is that not definite
@donovan jarvis  I do not consider it a definite answer because that passage originates from a draft that tolkien never finished  let alone published. plus the quote is told from the perspective of an elf who was told something about the dwarves  which could or could not be reliable. knowing those things  whether you consider it proof enough to be a definite answer is up to you.as for the passage I quoted  I ll let youread it for yourself  but there isn t much more context   https   imgur.com a 7npvxul  . the footnote is the part I quoted. as stated at the top of the image  it come from a letter written by tolkien not even a year before his death  so after pretty much everything else he has written. itseems pretty clear to me that he implied at least some female dwarves didn t have beards  but again  its my own interpretation  so I do not call it a definite answer either.
@tombomthefreemason  yeah  that is oddly specific.like you said  lore progression. maybe he first cemented the importance of their beards with  all male dwarfs  then later decided on females as well  it wouldn t contradict but oddly colors the original quote.I feel like even third-person narrators are unreliable. that aside  when a first-person narrator describes visual cues itseems like intentional worldbuilding for the reader. why else write it in the end  we both agree he was wrong in his claim and I now understand your stance.
@tombomthefreemason  yes  if you want female dwarves have no beards  you cantake it to mean as such. it is a stretch though because of the reality that male and female dwarves look indistinguishable from one another and one gender having no beard is quite an obvious giveaway... and this description is from the lotr series  stated by gimlI himself  which is the definitive text in which all canon is derived....
his claim to fame as a  lore expert  probably comes from watching the directors cut of the trilogy back to back a few times a day for an entire month
@roseofhizaki corey olsen is actually a very well known tolkien scholar. he did make a mistake in that video  but tbf in later writings tolkien heavily implies that at least not all female dwarves had beards.
@tombomthefreemason  corey olsen did made multiple mistakes in that video. also  the book referencing that female dwarves have beards is edited by the person who knew j. r. r. tolkien best  and his name is Christopher.... the ones in the nature of middle earth  which came out last year  were excerpts that Christopher tolkien did not include in the books that he edited and published.and if we are talking about implication  female dwarves having beards was implied  multiple times including in the return of the king  which the definitive source of what is considered canon  which paraphrase the one in war of the jewels  which specifically mentioned that female dwarves have beards.in any case  female dwarves were not even mentioned in the passage in nature of middle earth.
Im sorry how is she even a fan she is making dnd references for a series that literally inspired dnd.  she hasn t read the fucking books.
a lot of how we see tolkein has been impacted by gaming culture through advanced d d  d d  and computer games. but  in the literature there was magic  but for the elves it was an inherent and or natural ability. overall it is a low magic setting  compared to d d - but that is an outcome of needing to set out goals and achievements in games  whereas in an epic story  that is not necessary  though is there in part by the discovery of new weapons .
@mechminded  yea still not a mage just an inspiration for alot of exaggerated abilities in a table top game.  and you wrong about the magic of elves cause you haven t actually read the books...
@be1mont  did I say she was a mage  tolkien wrote of his magic  inherent power not possessed or attainable by men as such   I think  inherent and or natural ability  is a good enough proxy to that description.
@mechminded  yes another far reaching statement to relegate the lore to better fit her video.  nice.
@be1mont  motivated reasoning I see. enjoy.
the elven  magic  that people refer to isn t really magic at all. galadriel even tells frodo this in lothlorien. elves are the firstborn children and are much more aligned to arda and are thus bound to it. they live to enrich it  to love it and live amongst it for its own sake. whereas the atanI   men  the second born  have a much different relationship with earth. they use it only as a means to benefit from it and rule and have dominion. elves are much more closely tied to nature and to creation. and since the music of the ainur is what created everything into being  this is why elves sing so much and almost weave spells of enchantment and of creation. this is in their nature and seems like magic to men  but it is much deeper than that. galadriel being a calaquendI  the elves of light  she dwelt with the Gods of arda for millennia and it is said that the light of the two trees were enmeshed in her hair. this is so crucial to understanding the power of the calaquendI and why it distinguishes her from elrond  thranduil  celeborn  and even gil-galad. tolkien goes way more into this in his other writings  mostly in the laws and customs of the eldalI  and the conversation of finrod and andreth  where we get a lot more explanation of metaphysics in regards to the elves. all this to say  I think throwing around the d d term mage or comparing this to a class you d find in wow  like a priest or druid or something like that  really cheapens it  and I dont think its appropriate at all.
@sean hartel  just because dnd has a different interpretation of magic does not mean that what the elves do in tolkien s work is not magic. magic is the various disciplines in dnd  the songs of power in tolkien s  and the will and the word of eddings . the only difference is in scale. in short  magic the  is the supernatural ability of a race or individual to control or affect there surroundings. to elves  like galadriel  they might not view it as magic because it comes as natural to them. to them it is something  normal .
no and no.
they are the trolls and goblins of the puppet master  they dont see their strings.
well yeah but its not really comparable... saruman and gandalf are istarI and maiar. not plain mages
@dimitris  galadriel is arguably more powerful than gandalf
@shameen yakubu  perhaps she does save and she s very skilled too in magic.
so happy to see your channel thriving  congrats on the youtube partner
galadriel wasn t a young bratty lass during the second age. she was already a few thousand years old by then  she had matured long  long time ago. the period of her youth where she s described as immature  athletic  and strong had long passed by the second age.
no one was under the impression that galadriel isn t a bad ass  and I personally think itsaid more about her character thatshe had all this power yet relied on a myriad of other skills to achieve her goals. just good writing.
as a misogynist cis white male  galadriel was one of my top loved characters.  Im disappointment they are changing her character to fit a character profile tolkien never wrote.  she is best left as a cursed complicated  white-witch-style  character who decided the outcome of the third age and the eleven race.  a scrappy hot-headed warrior girl is not galadriel.  what a bunch of morons.  so annoying.  I would say  write a better character  but they shouldn t!  they should keep the actual galadriel that was already written by a genius.
galadriel also did not take part in the war of jewels  war of wrath  she was east of the misty mts in lorien at the time  or the war of the ring  beyond her council with the fellowship . she was the most fair and mighty elf that remained in me at the time of the wotring  but her might was in her magics and use of the elven ring of power. she was not mighty with a sword. there was also more wise elves in me such as her husband celeborn as well as elrond who was far more of an actual warrior than galadriel. I also think that glorfindel was more than likely the most powerful warrior overall in me if you combine martial skills with lore knowledge. but he was written out of the movies.
that is a real good viewpoint as I never thought of the characters as d d type classes.  and yeah  this whole series is sacrificed on the altar of diversity
fingolfin and f anor were both kind of spellswords not pure warriors  and galadriel is the same being a noldor elf born in valinor  luthien though is half maiar half sindar elf and relied purely on magic.
Im so glad I got to enjoy the hype and buzz for the lotr trilogy 20 years ago as a teen. it was magical. this amazon stuff is depressing.
I heard they were making galadriel some sort of war leader.  Im like  well  thats not ridiculous at all  she among the most powerful beings alive  she more than most elves had overwhelming ambition  etc  -- I saw the armor and I was like  oh  okay  youre sticking her in battle  thats kinda dumb  -- now its all about her being the whole  fierce warrior  more than someone who just marches around with an army ah  yeah  thats just an abomination of the character.
do you think you  lydon hall  renfeil  geeks and gamers  nerdrotic and a couple of others  could hop on a live stream and discuss this travesty  maybe everyone comes up with their own talking points and topics  and just pull the fandom in together for open discourse. could even have guest questions or topics from the community. I think it would be a hit.
Im actually kinda glad Imet my wife at the end of my army career. I spent the last 3 years of a 15.5 year career in the national guard. my daughters are young 6 1 2 years and 9 months and my step kids are 23  18 and 15. I did 3 combat tours during my active duty years. I did love living at ft polk  ft lewis and ft riley stateside...
keep up the good work! glad someone is still out here speaking from feelings!
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.  - j. r. r. tolkien
lol now Im actually trying to imagine bow slinging legolas as a bard legolas  wanna know how I got so good at picking this bow string  well let me tell you about my bard days.
your viewers are happy to support you. we re like a good bra or jock strap. we ll keep you comfortable when youre in a tough spot or when you just wanna show off the goods. how long before we see you on friday night tights    you d get a great amount of exposure with them and a new audience for your channel and gary said he d be happy to have you on a few weeks ago. it d be great to see another connection made between the nerd world and gaming galaxy
they talk about a young galadriel as if she was 20 or something during second age. she was freaking awesome as she was. she was daughter of finarfin. she was born in valinor before the first age of middle earth. she was undescribable ancient. they just cant get it!!!
great video! longtime tolkien fan here sad to see what is going on with this upcoming series. also  loved the verse of the day. keep it up!
tell me you ve never read a word of tolkien without saying you ve never read a word of tolkien. hello  amazon.
just got back from a beautiful walk around the arboretum here and taking some photos with my camera. my mom read me the hobbit as a young child. Im scared to even tell her what amazon is doing to a series I grew up with. we went to every single movie for the lotr and hobbit. I even played the snes game with my sister that had awful controls and you needed the instruction book for the maps!
imagine gandalf re-rolling class from wizard to warrior lmao
I love how you described yourself
actually music is such a huge part of the tolkien lore  that I d be surprised if he didn t know how to play an instrument.  songs even had magical capabilities and strength to them ie finrod on the isle of wizards against sauron.  this is just more ill informed information from a youtuber who doesnt know what she is talking about.. but she wants those likes.
gimlI said it best when he called her an elf  witch
in middle-earth role playing  merp   she is listed as a  mage seer  mystic .  I dont think she needs a sword. she just needs to say a word and use magic. way more advanced than swinging a sword.
I guess they think she was portrayed as weak. they dont think at all.. she is extremely powerful yet she feared temptation of the ring. their idea is a character cant have flaws and has to be unlikable and brash.
galadriel is ethereal  powerful and intense. you dont need to put armor on her to portray that. this new series sets fire to the tolkien canon and relishes in watching it burn.
fantasy nerd 101.  thank you! so many new takes on this stuff goes out of their way to alter characters to fit their needs instead allowing a character to help shape the story.
gaslight us into thinking this is what tolkien would have wanted    exactly  nailed the attempt to manipulate. they ve sunk too much money to scrap the footage and re-shoot  so they re trying to throw it at us and guilt us into feeling like its how it  should  be.
my dad was enlisted we only moved like two times when I was born his career was ending.he kinda fought in the gulf. I say kinda because he barley saw any action the infantry didn t really have a huge role in that war and he was fine with that.
I always come back to this channel for the melonie s wink thumbnail
well the thing is they did have tolkien scholars on their team  where tom shippey was one of them. after Christopher tolkien passed away they saw their opportunity and booted tom shippey and went their own way. that tells us how much they care about tolkien s works.
its not that they dont understand  its that they dont care because they re doing it on purpose
glad your channel is growing!!! still dont like how they re handling this lotr adaptation!! but I will still watch it with a bucket next to me in case I barf!!
the lesson of the scene where galadriel spoke to frodo of the one ring was that nobody was beyond the influence of the ring. but  we know the truth...nobody  except for samwise gamgee.
her power is evolved from her inner strength and wisdom.  they  dont want to work with fans  they want to show us we are wrong and push their agenda.
yes the galadriel coveting the ring scene is scary but its nowhere near shelob  because she s a spider
actually I always thought of galadriel as a priestess because she can heal resurrect protect shield and destroy with light.
Im gonna be super serious that not even sauron would want a conquer things as it is now. the really ironic thing is thatsauron wouldn t have to deceive them to conquerupdate   I was just a baby at the time but I was actually there when the berlin wall was torn apart sadly we couldn t even keep like a small piece as a trophy
overly manly men   thats toxic masculinity overly manly woman   wow  thats a strong woman
I thought Ive seen an article of them having one of the top lore guys of the books and writings and movies on the team but they fired him   most likely because he wasn t agreeing with the producers and directors .  I ll try and find the article .
legolas the bard had me howling
the time of man has fallen the time of the pronoun has come
well he wont need to conquer... if they keep making things woke they will eat themselves sauron wins by staying home sipping cocoa
@neil peart   haha I know right
@neil peart   another thing once I know how to do 3-d animation  do you mind if I actually do thatscenario  of course I am fully willing to give you credit for that idea.
@m3tr01d86  lol go ahead itseems the obvious outcome in my eyes woke on woke crimes seem to happen alot atm
id be interested in seeing that. now I gotta hop in the google lore machine  thanks.
Ive seen this happen with the witcher season 2. I love the books and they completely avoided most of the material from them. this will be the same
great take on it all.  easy to listen to.  keep it coming.
she s a red mage sub warrior if anything. Ive come for mithradir.  I will leave with here with him.  if you try to stop me  I will destroy you. all this said before she slaps an orc so hard it is turned to dust and afterwards bench presses gandalf down a flight of stairs bare foot. it easily follows that if cate blanchett s fading decrepit galadriel could do all this then she could easily take out a snow troll 3500 years earlier in her prime. she surely could throw one armored numinorian so hard as to change the other four s momentum. elves contended with melkor himself.
amazon is never stops making things worse. they are destroying so much ugh also melonie mac go boom. you definitely are becoming more big and soon you will get to 20k   keep at it
galadriel resembles the archetype of athena  the wise feminine that is the source of power and inspiration for the greatest warriors.. she also defines and demarcs the fatherland which can only be done in wisdom... her power and true power comes from her wisdom and influence and from what great warriors do with her encouragement. we saw how terribly powerful she can be when she was tempted by the ring. people dont understand that in the middle earth  power is not measured by blunt force  but rather by influence  beauty  goodness and wisdom... all of these things are what measure galadriels true hold on middle earth. without her  there is no definition of goodness or beauty  and no inspiration for others.
hey mel. wow you made some amazing points here. this is moose from. twitter by the way. great point with the legolas being a bard . I would have never thought to word it that way for what they are doing. that made perfect sense I wish I actually thought of it thats why you get the big bucks. seriously great video great points I have been a fan since you got me to work out and get healthy. I because of that I ll always be your fan. o yea I hope everything s is ok with your aunt sending good wishes.
while she is standing after a war that almost burned middle earth to the ground   wait what  now I know they didn t bother to do their research so allow me to correct them. the war they re referencing is the war of wrath in which galadriel  never participated in  she didn t participate in any of the wars of the first age except getting involved in protecting her people during one of the eleven kin slayings by feanor s sons  who are basically wildcards nobody liked in this time period . after this war was over  the entire continent of beleriand  a giant continent that use to exist to the west of the blue mountains of eriador  was so heavily damaged by chaos and destruction it took to defeat morgoth that tribes of the men of the edain moved further east to eriador and beyond or went west to numenor. the dwarves went east to their mountain holds in the blue mountains and eventually went further east until they migrated into khaza-dum  what later became moria  and created smaller settlements on the way. the elves either went further east to establish the kingdom of lindon with gil-galad or to join the smiths of eregion with celebrimbor  feanor s grandson . however  some sailed back to the valinor in the west.galadriel never fought morgoth. morgoth required maiar sent to lead the valar s armies in order to capture this asshole. he was only able to be defeated because by the time of the end of the war he had infused the world with so much of his evil power that his physical spiritual form was severely weakened. his hubris to corrupt the world led to his downfall. it is said thatsauron at his strongest was only equal to morgoth at the end of the first age. sauron is terrifying because of his power to manipulate others and his unnatural patience and desire for wars of attrition. morgoth was the incarnation of pure destructive  evil power. he was the strongest of all the ainur  spirits made by eru iluvatar due to his song of creation. they would later divide themselves as the higher level valar and lower level maiar . only one elven king ever dueled him and he was only able to injure this evil being s leg. he was later crushed by his massive hammer grond.
did tolkien really put his characters into boxes such as  mage    warrior    bard    itseems like everyone is their own unique class really. for example gandalf can cast spells but still does a lot of physical fighting.
gadriel is essentially an elf Goddess  she doesnt need armor or weapons.
galadriel desired the ring  as we saw in peter jackson s series no  we didn t  thatscene was  galadriel is given a test to see if she can resist the ring  and she does  which allows her to finally move on to the gray havens. that brief moment of temptation was less than we see for  say  boromir  or bilbo  even. it was a moment of  the ring is trying to control me  having been brought to my sanctified land  and it tries to do what it does  because it is afraid of frodo actually completing his task.
because I never had a twitter  facebook or other socials  only yt   I think im way more happy. and I saw it all from the start. im online since 1998 every day  I feel more that Imade the right choice.  because I like speaking my mind and if I did do that on those woke   cancel platforms   they would have banned me probably in 1 week. loland not the least ...all the stress I saved myself.channels like this make me smile more.  thanks melonie greets from the netherlands.
so lets get their idea straight..galadriel  one of the most powerful magicians in middle earth  when engulfed in rage  she turns to a sword and armor. riiiiiiightalso galadriel  who has lived for maaany millennia already when the rings are forged  is supposed to be  young and hot headed . riiiiiiightgaslighting at its finest.
bilbo scared me more than galadriel did. that face he made gave me nightmares
legolas singing to the fellowship is actually much closer to canon than hotheaded battlemaiden galadriel. first of all  galadriel was already very old... but secondly I would muuuuuch rather see a mage in a gorgeous gown felling men with her light and beautiful power.
finrod used magic but also used armor and fought with a sword  just read the silmarillion. he fought alone against sauron himself using chants of power  yet also fought at the first 4 battles of beleriand. you are analysing tolkien s work through fantasy traditions that did not exist at the time he wrote his work. she can be a mage-warrior without issue  the true issue is her being the commander of the northern armies since it is clearly stated thatshe ruled harlindon at the beginning of the sa before going away to create eregion.
saying that galadriel wasn t a warrior is gaslighting considering the fact that tolkien literally wrote galadriel as a warrior.
I always thought galadriel was mostly a magic user not a warrior.
like in some games  galadriel just changed her skill tree to a warrior
well  I would think that an immortal being  a practitioner of powerful magic  who s already 5000 years old at the time of this stage of the history of middle earth would have lived enough to already be the galadriel that we know from lotr.......
agree. galadriel was a powerful  terrible  and beautiful sorceress. I cant believe they slapped armor on her lol. hilarious.
she literally says has greatly desired the ring.  you are wrong.
this is the best comment yet cause ya know...he read the books.
galadriel was in the battle at alqualond   but in what capacity the silmarillion doesnt say. she s magically powerful because she s noldor from the lands of valinor  although it was noted thatshe was strong and athletic. in my mind I seem to recall thatshe learnt magic from one of the valar  but Im hazy on that. so could she be a warrior  sure  but she s not noted as being one.
its almost like they didn t see the hobbit  as you saw her fighting with her magic.
I like how they say its thousand of years back.. so they are going to make her a hot head but even if you make it a thousand years back she is still 5000 years old during this time period. dont make her into a mad pissed off teenager
I have this sneaky suspension they are trying to avoid a lawsuit because they dont have the rights to the 2nd age. if they make the characters completely different  the rights owners for the 2a stuff cant bring ligation.
what gets me is they call her young and hot headed but she is hundreds of years old when this show takes place.
happy to help out by giving you likes and I really enjoy your energy you put into your content its very enjoyable thank you very much
she got to level 2 and multi-classed. like they had a terrible dm  and the story was all over the show  and when a better dm took over  the story picked up.
also  galadriel was already an old bitty by the time the rings were crafted. she was born in valinor in the first age.
2 40 me playing final fantasy 14 where you switch classes  jobs  by simply equipping a different job stone  well  ackshulley...that is the final fantasy setting though  in this case I completely agree that changing galadriel from mage to warrior is insanity and an insult to the legacy of lotr. as mentioned  you do not need to have a sword axe bow to appear  powerful . galadriel s flare-up when frodo offered her the ring was indeed quite terrifying  we all know how much destruction mages are capable of. 3 25 same game  bard is actually the upgraded archer  using a weapon that is a bow and harp combo
thats just sad  and takes away from how insanely powerful a mage can be.
athletic is not a synonym for warrior. she is one of the oldest elves  and if I herd right  she s a noldor  one of the most powerful being to walk middle earth  it is postulated that even sauron could not withstand her power  hint it wasn t with a weapon like a sword. many have even speculated because of her being touched by both the two tree thatshe was imbued to poses light power from those trees. simply put  she didn t need a sword.
your video just popped up  in my feed  and Im glad that it did! especially liked how you finished with some scripture. youre a class act!
Im sorry but how do you think galadriel can be a mage when she doesnt have a ring          Imean this is second age we are talking about and not third. maybe when the rings are crafted she will gain those mage powers  anyway great video  like your opinion!
the more I hear about this series the more Im afraid to be buried under a ton of sh t
the fact that they dont even know she didn t claim the title of  queen  is also telling. ugh
her being hot headed isn t even accurate.  she was passionate about not being complacent.  but that is because of the kinslaying of the telerI by faenor and his sons.  she was also very cautious of trusting humans due to the betrayal of the numenoreans.  but she wasn t killing orcs like a warrior.  she was more a statesman.  especially because  out of all the noldor elves  only she was welcomed pretty much by all elves.  also  the older elves get  the more powerful and ethereal.  by the time this series takes place she is tens of thousands  if not hundreds of thousands of years old.  or at least thats how I remember it.  she was born before the elves returned to middle earth so she ancient beyond belief.  she should effectively be unchanged between this series and the movies as it is a tiny fraction of her total life.
evil is not capable of creating anything new  it can only distort and destroy what has been invented or made by the forces of good.    j.r.r. tolkien
Im new to your channel this is my first video of yours that I seen it kind of blew me away there at the end with you quoting the Bible verses that is absolutely amazing thank you so much give me a joy joy feeling in my heart that is awesome. you have a new subscriber and me thank you
the picture of legolas with the lute caught me off guard. that was ridiculously funny lol.
I guess we ll end up seeing hot-headed warrior galadriel show up in battle scenes of the last alliance. ugh!
bless
lol do you think she needs a ring to do magic ever heard of melian or luthien
@shameen yakubu  ok but still
Im happy you enjoyed that
galadriel in the 1st age was taken under the wing of melian she taught her how to make lambus bread and other magic.
I know some social media content creators want to avoid getting political but you never seemed happier and more inspired than right now with your new content. this seems to have been your calling. taking risks can be scary but if you aren t true to yourself and your beliefs you will never find true happiness.
one does not simply reclass from a mage into a warrior.........
not a hint of galadriel ever even touching a sword in all of the ages lol
so when they say that galadriel is young and hot headed. do they realize thatshe was 5000 years old in the second age   how much more maturing is a 5000 year old even capable of
the sindarin name galadriel was about her hair of gold and silver sheen  not about having braided hair.
love seeing your channel increase a few hundred subs a day! keep it up!
he s a bard now   he s a bard now!
its amazing how hard some work to make a fake depiction actually accurate when it is a whole lot easier to stick with the original content.
thank you melonie for another wonderful topic on your chanel.Ive haveenjoyed the original lor movies.thanksto you continuing to bring this out in the open.I still have no interest on seeing amazons version. see you tomorrow takecare melonie enjoy your weekend
forget galadriel - that lady in armor doesnt even look like an elf.we ve had decades of amazing artwork of elven women in armor. they re slender  sharp  agile  organic. they look lighter than air. they look like they could balance on a blade of grass. but I guess amazon missed all of that  and we got stuck with generic blonde lady of power.
commenting to feed the algorithm .  and adding a bit more this time.they should have just explained it d d style.  gladriel started as a warrior class  but later decided to multi-class into wizard.  she discovered liked wizard more and respected her warrior levels to wizard.
crowned with a braid  is such an eye-roller that its hysterical!
nice to see you  melonie! congratulations on the new channel
finally someone brought it up!!!! thank you.
in lore galadriel was never hot headed her powers was calm and more
even if it is the younger version of galadriel she would still be a thousand years old in this setting. xd so technically they re telling us she had learned nothing of her long existence and remained a brash hot head during this time
she s a warrior now because as the critical drinker would say   the message.
thatseries was filmed here in new zealand and the next season will be filmed in the uk and the media here didn t rate the show very well.
I think gimlI as a bard is a pretty good comparison
also because tolkien describes her as a warrior in the shibboleth of f anor.
@ryan cruz  I read the lotr and the hobbitseveral times. I read some other tolkien works such as farner giles of ham great story by the way . I dont remember reading anywhere thatshe was a warrior. Im sure the show s creators didn t bother to read tolkien s work.
Imean  they were probably right when they said   this is what tolkien would ve wanted.  I bet he would ve loved seeing his fans stand up against this disgrace.
this is one thing I didn t like about skyrim when they removed the level cap because then you could change your class with enough levels. even in kotor you would choose your class carefully especial for a second play through.
they did the exact same thing to wheel of time. in books  perrin is a shy teen  in crap tv series  he is married and snogs his wife kills wife in first episode. wtf.
brand new to your channel and I love that you end with a Bible passage!
I have a feeling they are replacing glorfindel with galadriel and its honestly tilting to me because he was removed in the movies which Im not mad about because what peter jackson did with arwen was great and his role was so minor to begin with. I just absolutely love glorfindel because the man killed one of the most powerful balrogs and died but was able to come back to continue his work and live in middle earth. Im wanting to watch this Im not worried about giving different races Im just disappointed that they cant seem to do anything right atm. I can only hope for the best and hope that it does okay. I think galadriel as a warrior could be fun and maybe seeing elrond becoming the man we saw fight in the war against sauron. Im wanting to be hopeful but being hopeful has burnt me in the past
there is a ton of galadriel in shadow of war. from that alone I know more than amazon haha. great video
I guess galadriel is the first character to be nurfed because of a woke movement. galadriel spent time with the vala and melian  this is before the second age. she is  in the second age  the most powerful character other then ainur.
did anyone else think thatscary galadriel was terrifying but hot  Imean like the bard be like  this is a bad idea but totally worth it.
it has not released yet but I can already see the shock wave of how big of a bomb this is going to be.
so  they have failed to explain in a 50 second teaser from a 10 hour long season  in a television show that nobody has seen yet  great logic.
so basically we have an angry ray from star wars but blonde with a genetic fantasy story plopped in the mythology of Lord of the rings... as opposed to a mysterious  magical elf woman who is carefully woven into that mythology over millennia. part of what makes galadriel so cool was thatshe was mysterious. tolkien kept most of his magical characters under a certain level of mystery because it makes them feel more mythical and powerful. he didn t go deep into filling out every technical detail of how they did things. tolkien did this on purpose because he was mirroring how norse mythology was written. this show wont respect that at all and will take all the mystery and intrigue from the elves  dwarves  and n men reans and make them all seem like woke americans with overly explained abilities. it hurts my heart.
haha it was so funny seeing her dog walk out of the room when she starts the video!
every proper d d  dweller knows that you simply cant change a warrior into a mage and vice versa...
subscribed! Im so mad on what they are doing. but hey at least they are open now and not hiding it anymore.
awhhh yeees its been years since Ive seen your content! been following your content  since 2013 when you were still talking about horizon zero dawn alpha footage and your love for tomb raider    awesome to hear youre on the same page on tolkiens work
go boom  reminds me of one of gammamon s favorite catch phrases.
galadriel paid  24.99 for a class respec token and redistributed all her existing points into the warrior skill tree. the hard part was raid grinding for all that epic heavy armor  because you know  the cash store gear sucks.
when I saw galadriel wearing an armor I was like  dude... she is one of  is not  the most powerful being in all middle earth... she does not need armor!
it makes 100  sense as season 2 she is addicted to old toby and has a forbidden romance with an ent.
basically galadriel is going to be like yennefer in the netflix witcher and screaming all the time
all who look upon me  and despair.
I bet she uses world buffs too in this  things of power .
I was just watching you for the lotr content until you did the verse of the day  now youre one of my favorite youtubers!!
channel is growing quick mac cuz you freakin rock!
there are no  classes  in lotr.  yes there were witches and wizards  but it wasn t like magic users never wore armor and wielded weapons  ie sauron and the witch king . tolkien never depicted galadriel as an armor wearing warrior  but she did come to middle earth as part of a massive elven army that was sent to defeat morgoth so I dont think its too far fetched to have her decked out in armor ... if this story took place in the first age.  this story takes place in the second age though  after the war with morgoth. the second age was largely a time of peace  until the very end when they fought sauron.  maybe thats why she s wearing armor  who knows. Im willing to give the show a chance  but Im more concerned about how much they re going to compress these events  which take place over the course of centuries  into a single point in time.
I love you adding verses at the end it makes my heart sing
love your channel!  youre awesome  hope youre having a great day
this feels like star wars the rise of skywalker  fans want palpatine to have a lightsaber  but kathleen kennedy wants him to be so powerful that he doesnt need one.fans dont want galadriel to have a sword because she is so powerful thatshe doesnt need one  but amazon wants her to use one.
tolkien never said she was an amazon warrior  what the letter actually says is  ...she had long hair which glistened like gold but was also shot with silver. she was then of amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats. letter 348she bound up her hair to do sports...the only physical combat she is said to have engaged in is defending her telerin kin at the first kinslaying  before leaving aman .a slight criticism  the whole mage thing is to rpg for tolkien s works.
coming from d d  meaning basic d d  to me all elves are fighter-mages.  -   its not necessarily something I have a problem with.
in the silmarilion tolkein says galadriel s own mother called her  man-maiden ...
I bet they would try to pull an ainz ooal gown if they could but ainz has a spell that lets him change his class at will. ainz is from overLord
man  I thought I was up on lore after reading the books and watching the films. still  literally none of the casting or trailers bothers me. it looks good. all these videos about how bad it looks   things like mage vs warrior make me feel like I need to go back. Imean  gandalf isn t a warrior but he fights and leads. Im not clear on why its a problem. can anyone explain
I am fortunate enough to see your channel grow from video one. you are awesome and we need more chicks like you on youtube. love your content. fuck gamestop.
okay so they gender swapped stider aragorn and made her galadrial so thatshe would fit the setting. like that makes any since. guess they needed the archetype to make the story work.
not only this but galadriel was never a hot head. she was there at the kin slaying but did not take part in it. that tells me all I need to know about the character. she was a bad ass and never needed to prove herself everyone was already aware of it.
you go girl!
good video  thanks for sharing your faith as well! God bless!
I want to know when we will see melonie on the time pool show.
I really enjoy youre content  best wishes.
amazon continues to prove the writers play 5e d d that anyone can be anything on a whim.
when they add glorfindel  he will be some bald brute... lmao
if anything make him tony hawk. some insane shield  skills
poor thing. you could assume rpg wise that legolas is a bard already as he sings the fellowship the song of nimrodel when they enter lorien...
its possible to change a character s class but not without a serious definable reason. they re excuse is muh strongk and hot-headed so she s a warrior now
galadriel just looks like some random human female warrior now
could you do one on peter jackson s  the war of the rohirrim  due out in 2024
they made all the magic go away from the story and turned it into something mundane.
its gaslighting as far as the new generation works. this generation coming in saying that   since we saw the movies when we were young  this property now belongs to us and we re gonna tell you what tolkien did and did not want to do.  they will twist whatever was actually said or intended and even go as far as to redefine words to support their narrative and agenda. this ish is cray cray yo!!!
wasn t galadrial pregnant in the beginning or middle of the second age   also I feel like there trying to replace a male character already in the books place with her lol
amazon s literally burned tolkien s books.
they should have worked with more fans  well they would have had to care about the original work even just a little. there actions are nothing short of malicious.
this should be in the second age of middle earth  isn t galadriel already thousands of years old by then
bardgolas  graduate from the college of archery. he draws back and lets loose works of art.
I do think she fought in the first and second age  but having her wearing the armor in the first pics is just a bad marketing move. she probably only wore it in battle  not just walking to arda
theory  in the quest for green energy  hollywood directors have found an untapped resource  dead creatives. tolkien is spinning in his grave right now like a neutron star. hook him up to a generator and they ll power england.
she had magic that could level castles and mountains. why is she in armor and using a sword.
galadriel is a very old noldo. she can do pretty much w e she wants and still be better at it than any man and most elves.
huh  tolkein himself said that in her youth galadriel was a great athlete who outmatched many male noldor.
archtype wise  they swapped galadriel and elrond.
legolas as a bard with the ranger abilities still there   ffxiv bardImean  he s clearly a dex cha build.
I bet none of the supershills know who characters that wasn t in the movies  like tom bombadil  is.
mages dont need armor or swords cause the can crush you with their powers  they just get in the way.
she was never hot headed  she was already 1000s of years old and wise behind her years.
honestly I would prefer to know what happen after lotr - return of the king rather than events prior to any of the books.
warrior classes are traditionally male so it doesnt surprise me that amazon wanted to give a woke treatment in every single way possible. listen nothing wrong with female warrior characters but I also think galadriel expressed her femininity through her class  specially the way blanchett played the character  which if you are doing visual media you kinda have to take her like reference
galadriel the sorceress enchanter bewitcher of men.
this backtory sounds like it was intended to serve a woke message. changing galadriel into a josn of arc.
they are basically turning galadriel into their newest marysue
wasn t galadriel around 5000-7000 years old already in the second age when she actually  fought  morgoth  how can she still be hot headed at that point  in the first age she declined to fight morgoth  because she thought him too strong. does thatsound hot headed
even battle mage or spellsword wouldn t wear metal armor its too heavy to move thats why they wear leather armor. they dont understand an elves lifespan.
I dont really care if they stay super faithful to the source honestly. just as long as its a good show!sadly we know it wont
didn t amazon just admit that they didn t get the rights to the silmarillion or any of tolkien s other writings  this show will basically be fanfiction.
remember  a tolkien scholar quit this show last year.
now Im just imagine legolas the bard trynna get freaky with smaug
legolas as a bard is probably better than anything they ve come up with tbh.
I need more info on the little doggie with the little t shirt on.
diggin  this this format. the comments interaction especially. if you ever get a negative comment  throw it in the video so we can all enjoy roasting it. also  how bout a some fitness stuff  my routines are starting to get boring  maybe a stretch or exercise of the day
amazon re-edited the trailer to show less of that ice-jump cgImess.
this fanfiction isn t ruining tolkeins work.
isn t she  like  one of the most powerful  feared  and well-respected beings in middle earth  not a fan so please correct me  and I get that this is a prequel  but I still feel like this is a downgrade for her character. like not all strong women use blades. many of my favorite manhwa heroines use cunning and intellect. all have this air of elegance meets confidence. only using head on violence as a last resort. I got the same feeling with galadriel when I first met her.
get it melonie!! congrats!
they nerfed galadriel by giving her a warrior role. her mere presence is powerful enough to drive away the enemy...not some bullshit warrior
liked for the content  subbed for the verse of the day
one shot questers
I ll have to feature her in an intro
Im new to your channel  but have come to respect your opinion. and I actually thought of a way that all the furor over this travesty could have been prevented  for me at least  and would love to get your take.consider the following title   the Lord of the rings                                                    the rings of powernow consider this change                                                    the rings of power                                   inspired by j r r tolkien s the Lord of the ringsat this point there is no fuss about lore butchering. we know its something different. and by citing tolkien and his creation  you show him respect instead of the contempt that is now evident.then all you have to do is say   the fan base has spoken!!!!!!    apologize   for example   we never intended to make a sweeping statement that all lotr fans were racially  trans  gay  lesbian or culturally phobic etc.  etc. then change the character s names and make any other necessary changes. but amazon  if you see this  dont pretend all this isn t based on money. you wanted thatsexy title line  paid a bundle to get it and were going to have it no matter what  and so here we are. and please  stop exploiting other artist s masterpieces and try creating your own! and if that fails just try showing respect and affection for the astonishing effort that brought us this beloved creation. would love your thoughts and the thoughts of any who read this. would this work for you
the fact that they referred to galadriel as  queen of lothlorien  tells me all I need to know about their knowledge of the lore. it is tolkien 101 that galadriel and celeborn dont take the titles of queen and king. they should know that. do better showrunners  or dont do this story at all!
she s mostly a magic user melonie. the idea of her being a warrior is absurd. she s known for her intense magic.
they dont care about consistency  they dont care about authenticity  they ll say whatever they want to try and construe the truth into their narrative  they are just vile at the end of the day.though take solace that they re at least seeing the actions of fans and realising that without us chattering about the series  normal average people will not watch this as its just going to be another in the long list of boring cookie cutter shows that come out in every year.
she changed her occupation class from mage to warrior is all. they stole that from final fantasy tactics  and other games. lol
for amazon  the golden goose is prime. if you dont attack prime  they wont feel it. I just dropped my prime membership. Im not on twitter  but I d love someone who is to share the tag  notprimetime to start a prime boycott over this.
yeah wow they really are out of touch. that paragraph about young galadriel being  full of piss and vinegar   and the story-line exploring how she transformed into a stateswoman doesnt sit well with me at all... before this article I was giving the screenwriters the benefit of the doubt  now I feel  they should have hired a nerd.  dont mess with the script  especially when its such an ambitious work like tolkiens books. the cynic in me suspects that transforming it into a woke story was the main point with taking on this story all along. rewriting books and history occupies lots of people.
youreally should read the shibboleth of f anor.
great video. what they are intending to do with lotr. there is no curse in elvish  entish  or the tongues of men for this treachery!
their dogma is so chaotic they dont get many things.
I do wonder why people feel the urge to change a character when the original depicts her as a really strong and independent girl woman. in the process to make it empowering they end up with the thing they set out to avoid.their own prejudgement view cloud the reading of said text  and therefor miss the authors intention and ground breaking views.
amazon s show can only be regarded as fanfiction from now on. we know its not lorebased. nothing else needed to say.
exactly  she does not need a sword or armor. she can kill people with a snap of her fingers.they really trying hard to ruin this show.
galadriel is already one of the most powerful magic users at this time. why would she bother with a sword in the first place  that would be a downgrade for her.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.
the real question should be   why do they believe they need to make her a warrior  are they mageaphobes  magists   did they see her kick the eye s arse  solo  I think not.
amazon seems to have a habit of butchering franchise stories. the recent retooling of tom clancy s without remorse novel was the same...titles and names were the same  but the characters and stories were practically unrecognizable.
y all never heard of the  fighter mage  class in various fantasy role playing games...  including merp..
when you talk crap about something to the general public you might get away with it but if that topic has nerds who know their stuff you will not get away with anything this is the perfect example we nerds know what youre doing and we are all calling bs lol
she s not even young. Im pretty sure she s like 5000 years old in the second age
I would like to see bard legolas sing toss a coin to your witcher
largely the people complaining about these things have no intention of actually playing the games  watching the movies  reading the books etc. they simply want to feel better that they made a stink online and made somebody change something. they rarely have any kind of lasting interest in the thing they just ruined.
to be fair legolas did sing to the fellowship  if im not missremembering
amazon is messing with the wrong people. thank you melonie.
the theory that random guy with galadriel is actually sauron an they bang probably worries me
each day I die more on the inside because this is not lotr  this is blasphemist
the show runner s casual reading of the text  if he read it at all  is the same kind of reading that gave us winged balrogs. its a clear failure to understand similes and metaphors. one point of nerd contention. galadriel isn t a mage or a warrior. her power is directly linked to her wisdom  which she attained by close proximity to the valar in valinor. so if youre thinking in the d d sense  she s more like a cleric.
you are almost to 20k! you go!
next they will say this is a parallel universe   a different turning of the wheel  or whatever.
I will watch it but only because I already have amazon prime. I doubt they will get any new customers because of it though
this series is about as interesting as a fart in the wind
whenever melonie compares Lord of the rings to dnd  sauron kills a hobbit.  please think of the hobbits.
amazon wants to make the new game of thrones  but its going to be a game of thrones season 8 recreation and we know how that turned out to bea massive dumpster fire
fantastic video! great verse btw!  isaiah is such a great book! even though through isaiah God tells hezekiah that he will stay sick and not recover  God shows mercy and grace by hearing hezekiah s prayers thus demonstrating God is indeed rich in mercy. isiah is awesome because you see many of Gods attributes on display. it is one of my favorite texts from the tanakh and its cool how it discusses God s coming judgement on israel while looking to the coming hope of a new covenant and the coming messiah.for Christians isaiah 53 describes the sacrifice of Christ its a beautiful chapter.
they said that themselves   it felt only natural to us that an adaptation of tolkien s work would reflect what the world actually looks like.  they are taking us to not miiddle-earth  welcome to  united states of middle-earth  if you catch what want to say by that.
let s switch legolas from archer to bard ffxiv players  I dunno....
its equals making yamcha a God in dragon ball lol
thats why youread the source materia first  or watch the movies  or just hire someone that cantell you...
okay legolas the bard actually sounds cool  but itsounds like the pitch for a new character. it def isn t something you d do to the actual character of legolas.
now I want to watch this spinoff legolas the bard
thank you! Im so excited!
tolkien letter 210.  he hated the idea of his work being purposely misinterpreted and its themes and characters being dishonored.
as a veteran d d player  I find this conflicted  elves are kind of warriors mages bit that is in d d or wow worlds I dont think tolkien intended galadriel that way.  they wont respect the lore!
I knew it would be mess but I think it will be even worst  d
love the isaiah quote and subscribed.
if the lore and world is not gonna be respected they should just do something diferent  but people like the ones in charge  lack imagination. using something established without loving it or knowing a thing about it is really stupid. I dont  want sh t from their version of  real world  being imposed  I dont comment a lot on topics like this but I think we are just tired. greetings I love your channel!
if you look at galadrial even in her young years she was never a warrior in the terms we think of when we hear the word. she is never depicted as wearing armor in any of the lore. also she was never a hot head in any lore. the race of elves were a lot different from the race of men. men were the hot-headed while the elves where mostly wise and such with the exceptions of the dark elves who in most lore the chaotic ones who got their name from the fact that they were dark of skin lived under the earth and were sensitive to the sun so they usually only came to the surface under the cover of the moon. galadrial wasn t a mage either at least not like man s version of the mage. she was an all powerful elf who was one of the leaders of the elf factions. she didn t need weapons because she had powerful magic that very few could rival. amazon can make up her early years but it goes against everything that made the surface elves unique in their own. tolkien doesnt outright say that elves were different but the character difference between elves and men are clearly stated. the elves were noble fair peaceful unchaotic thats why the villains had such a hard time turning them. you have the elvian rings of power but as soon as the elves found out they were made to enslave them they removed them where as the men were prone to greed and power and in every case the exact opposite of their human neighbors. amazon trying to  change the very thing that made the elves who they are and changing elvish characters who played a major role in the older Lord of the rings films.
legolas the bard  sounds nice I d pay this company to see legolas sing.
galadriel 2022 aka amazon version of ray from star wars.
galadriel  insted of a dark Lord you would have a multi-class warrior mage barbrian
wait  she s carrying around a broken sword  fnlol.
so you are not impressed with the new lara croft because she is not enough of a warrior  and you aren t impressed with galadriel being a warrior. sound like you just want these characters portrayed consistently and coherently. itseem like these people making these decisions are trying to tell us what we should want out of these characters.
well  youre not exactly right. galadriel is very powerful  spiritually. in fact  one of the mightiest on middle-earth in that respect. but she s not really a mage. her magic is more subtle than that.  but yes  she was not an armor clad  sword swinging warrior ever in her life.
when these clowns heard the jack and jill nursery rhyme they thought jack was literally wearing a crown.
she s the knight of the series it looks like  were they even reading the books  a melee character had armour  an archer leather  a caster cloth  they are readers  writers  magic users  not a melee fighter. makes no sense.
my name means  golden woman made of gold   should I start gold-coating my whole body for full representation of my name  lol
everyone should watch ign s interview with tolkien expert corey olsen. the trailer isn t as off as people think.
there is no curse in elvish  entish  or the tongues of men for this treachery.  amazon didn t make me happy with their  adaptation  of the wheel of time  fool me once... this trailer just screamed... Im gonna fool you twice. they are done and need to go back to dropping crap off on my front porch.
they made a video with paid influencers and called them  superfans  while the only thing they talked about is  muh representation
the backstory is inaccurate. galadriel did not get involved in the war of wrath at the end of the first age. and her brothrers survived well into the second age.
and why her armour looks like something made in numenor in 2 nd age  not like elfish one
actually she was tall  strong and match for any eldar athlete  ... she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the noldor  she was strong of body  mind  and will  a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the eldar in the days of their youth. and ... being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the valar thought fit to give the eldar ...
@tr1x 24  key word athlete... so she could keep up with traveling all over middle earth  what she was indeed doing... but nowhere was mentioned  she took up arms.it would have made so much more sense to make galadriel the ambassador to the dwarfs and elrond the leader of the elves hunting the remains of melkors horde... but that doesnt fit in todays hollywood narrative.galadriels seer power was looking into the soul of a person and then glimpse on the strength of character...
@marcel  if its not mentioned  it doesnt mean she didn t  it was so little we know of 2nd age  except main events  basically nothing.
@tr1x 24   athletic  is not synonymous with  warrior .to take up armor and sword with the intent to kill  to charge into the horrors and extreme violence of a battle field  takes a different kind of skill set and mind set than running a track or competing in a game.take your average nfl player  clearly a peak athlete  slap some armor on him  give him a sword and shield and drop him into a pitched battle anywhere in history and see how long he lasts.spoiler alert  about 30 seconds. maybe.
@tr1x 24  yes  but if it is not written  it also should not be interpreted into her character when all we know of her did not lean in that direction... dont get me wrong  I absolutely love galadriel  she is by far my favorite female in tolkiens whole work and in the top 3 of all characters with beren and samweis the other two
@marcel  nowhere is it mentioned that elrond took up arms either. therefore elrond should not be fighting for one moment in the series  like he did in jackson s adaptation in the prologue to fotr as its lore inaccurate. - your logic
@tr1x 24  if not being mentioned meant that you can shoehorn anything  then literally anything can happen. that is a slippery slope I would advice you not to use as a foundation for your argument.try to work around the lore that tolkien wove to come up with a logical conclusion. galadriel was never mentioned to carry a sword into battle  much less in heavy armor  but multiple implications did state of her abilities in wielding magic. she is derisively known as a  witch   hence why most people believe the commonly accepted narrative of her being a mage.
@warren peace  ok  so she is a mage  does that means she cant use sword or wear armor  isnt gandalf wizard and he uses sword more often then magic also  was it anywhere mentioned that on her mission against necromancer and on her attack on dol guldur with army during lotr what exactly she wear   because if not  how do you know thatshe didn t wear armor and had sword  or did she lead an army in her nightie  as she was shown in peter jackson hobbit.
@tr1x 24  again  context. gandalf uses spell and sword because he was shown in the books to wield both. in any case  have you seen gandal wear plate armor  and if I remember correctly  gandalf did not wield a sword until they found glamdring.yes  galadriel did  cleanse  the evil in dol goldur which implies she used magic  but that was after the elves of lorien commanded by her husband celeborn  as well as elves from mirkwood and rivendell  drove the orcs away from the fortress... she was not a frontline combatant  neither was it mentioned thatshe fought with sword or bow  and so  why would she wear plate armor
my name means black so Im black now tbh
considering they have the actual rights to the first age or the second age of tolkien s works  I sort of get it. they wanted to cash in  and thought the fans were stupid. they did it to marvel  and dc fans. they tried to do it with star wars. got a bit of backlash. but they forgot tolkien s works had a rich history because thats what he intended.  he tried to make a new mythology for england. that was the point. tolkien wanted anglo saxons to be remembered. its why he made the rohirrimen. to create a mythology that other contries forgot  or ignored. because he was sad  anglo saxons were forgotten. history is written by the victor s and tolkien tried to subvert that. oh. looks like he was a little better at subverting expectations. fancy that.
is it wrong that I think the joke character legolas the bard actually works.  Imean middle earth  its myth and religion all have a connection to music and song.  hell  every song in the films were not made for the films  they re in the books  and are even longer with more lines and stanzas.  music is something ingrained into the very creation of arda  so everyone taking a second class in level 1 bard would 100  make sense even when put against tolkein s text.  meanwhile  let s take a mage who s literally able  with just a jug of water and a fountain  is able to bring forth visions of the future.  this high level mage who s literally able to see visions of the future....naw  she started out as a warrior and multi-classed later after hit a few levels and realized thatshe wanted to be able to cast magic missile.   s. even jackson knew how to properly use galadriel and he broke canon.  galadriel doesnt fight...she doesnt wear armor or lead armies.  she s so powerful  she has people that do that for her  see haldir in jacksons two towers .
we already know her younger years and its not this
damn I haven t seen melonie content for almost 10 years  its good to see her lips are small again.
this article makes no sense on why they made her a warrior. they are try hards at this point
like gandalf said  swords are of no more use here
knowing how hard the tolkein foundation went after dungeons   dragons for using  hobbit  in a homage to the world  and looking at this bastardisation that was supported by the same  sad times. sad times in deed.
you can watch the video  top ten fears  from the channel  tolkien untangled   too. its a joke  what amazon ist doing here.tolkien himself would really hate this  look at his letter to zimmermann for example.peter jackson made changes  too. for example the armors  but overall  he tried zu keep the tolkien spirit in mind. amazon doesnt.and why the hell  doesnt the dwarf women have a beard
dude legolas bard ftw!! legolas the spoony bard!make gimlI a thief class.
look up wu zetian  hatshepsut  elizabeth the 1st to name three there are more. very scary women. you dont need a sword in your hand to be feared to be strong  to be a leader of men.
so good. the Bible verse is !
pretty sure I could crack a joke about  one ring ruling them all  and how amazon s ring is basically an asshole squeezing one giant poop out.
there s almost nothing canon about the description of galadriel that we see in the trailer 1- galadriel never tried to revenge any of her killed relatives in battle .one can see thatshe does that in the trailer. this is explicitly non canon.2-galadriel is portrayed with the emblem of the house of feanor  while she belongs to the house of finarfin. this is explicitly non canon.3- finrod felagund   her oldest brother is portrayed in a battle  probably the dagor bragollach  this has been confirmed by amazon representatives    the fourth of the battles of beleriand.  then this same character is shown captured in the trailer. this is explicitly non canon. finrod was nos captured in this battle. furthermore  this is described in the silmarillion  as part of the first age. amazon has rights to use only events of the second age  according to the tolkien estate. this is explicitly non canon  and could imply legal charges for ip piracy.4-her physical age shows very off with respect to what she was portrayed in the lotr movies. she is shown as a mature woman in the trilogy while she is not much older than a teenager in the trailer. but the tiem span between events is just an age   which is not much in terms of galadriels life span. you know  she is damn old as an elf. at the third age she is more than 8000 years old. in the events shown in the series she would be more than  5000 years old. she should look mature already. amazon producers got the rights from the tolkien estate to make the series as long as they did not contradict any of the events as written by jrr tolkien or as shown in the lotr movie trilogy. this is an explicit violation of that legal agreement.5-more generally she is portrayed as a warrior amazon. tolkien went far to describe she had another kind of power  not less effective than that of the best warrior. galadriels character in the books is an echo of an oldest  and even more powerful female elf. luthien   who married a mortal for the first time and stole one of the silmarills from morgoth by using spells . she was never described dressed in a heavy cuirass kicking orcs. nothing wrong with female amazon warriors. I am a fan of uma thurman in kill bill  grace jones in conan the destructor  sigourney weaver in alien   xena the princess warrior   etc because they make sense in the frework the stories are set. they are unique   and they have bad ass charisma.
galadriel was not a mage... tolkien makes a point of her saying in lotr that the elves do not rightly understand what the hobbits mean by the word  magic . magic as such is just another art or skill within arda and describing galadriel as a mage is just as wrong as describing her as a warrior. that being said galadriel did embody aspects of both  she did use  magic   some of it learnt from melian and did fight at the first kin-slaying in defense of her mother s kin
they have no respect for the original material.  they re just using it as a  skin  to tell their own stories  regardless of how tolkien s ethos clashes with it.
who wants to see legolas becoming a mumble rapper
galadriel is clearly a druid.  sorry for being contrarian.
they have to ruin everything  canon matters. keep up the great work.
legolas the bard is now cannon idgaf  how dare they do this  I hope each and everyone involved in this steps on lego
I  am sorry I got distracted by the little fuzzball rolling out your door lol
we have some great headcanon going on here
thanks for the clarification
battle mages 100  wear armor and swords.I actually dont know shit about lotr but 10 minutes on the internet reading long reddit posts made by nerds confirming thatshe in fact wore a sword and fought battles but she s more of an offensive fighter like she wouldn t go out of her way to fight battles.
what I think in the coments below is thou art awesome mate  -  carry on - good to see a fresh face in the culture war
subbed.  lotr scholar here.  you win.
I know your heart is in the right place and your are cute like a kitten  but dont map tolkien characters with d d classes -- this is messed up xdlegolas is singing in the books. everyone does -- it is the main entertainment in this time. but above all  d d has classes based on the tolkien works -- the prime source of fantasy genre. but not other way around
what they haven t explained is why she has elsa hair!
in dungeon and dragon terms gandalf is a druid fighter . not a wizard fighter
how to spot the woke fans from the nerd fans  nerd fans talk about lore  woke fans talk about tax policy
in before they respond that gandalf changed up and not knowing the difference
cant you get majors in tolkien literature  how did this show ever make it past the idea room  amazon is fighting a different beast here. they re trying to dismantle the foundation of the fantasy genre itself  it feels intentional.
darn. its a fine video but I cant think of anything to say. I was hoping for another heart. if I do get another at some point I ll probably float to the ceiling.
gala is always a mage not no dam xena
galadriel is a maiar. she existed before the world was even created. she s basically a demiGoddess.
they dont have the rights to the silmarillion yet they still wanted to make a show based in the 2nd age which most of it was told in the silmarillion smh.
mage  this is not d d. is this irony  there is more support in the lore for artanis nerwen aka galadriel not shying away from battle then arwen rushing to save frodo  sword in hand.the problem is if they characterize her as a warrior and a frontline sword wielding  plate armor wearing  brianne of tarth-joan of arc hybrid.she was both an athlete and lore master in her youth  as well as a headstrong leader. due to her bloodline and fate  she was very powerful and she participated in activities that were dominated by distinguished elven Lords as their peer  her mother called her nerwen meaning man-maiden . it makes perfectly sense thatshe could lead warriors into battle  but only if there was a dire need and no other options available. plate armor seems off tone at best. the sword as a main weapon is questionable  but not impossible I guess. a bright mail  white short dress hemmed with gold and silver and a glimmering spear I would find more likely to be her battle gear  especially in her youth.
legolas the bard sings toss a coin your wizard.
funny you talked about legolas being a bard  I was just thinking of a bard s tale. there should be a bard s tale movie. why have we never gotten a bard s tale movie yet  ridiculous.
the graceful  angelic  majestic  matriarch of all elves  blessed with wisdom and magical power near equal to the lesser Gods  becomes a hot head young warrior in human armor  this occurs after thousands of years spent under the close personal guidance of the valar  the highest of the Gods in the universe  it ll be fine!
3 lines into the article  galadriel is shown in the fellowship of the ring as a serene elf leader seriously pal  seriously
did anyone who is complaining about warrior queen galadriel actually read the silmarilion    the galadriel of the lotr was the mellow galadriel. thats not how she started. there s other things wrong with this interpretation but putting galadriel in armor is not one of them.
just imagine describing a real woman as  full of piss and vinegar . just imagine.
thank youuuu!
youre welcome.  if you d like any lotr information  I ll be happy to provide it
rofl I live my life comparing everything to d d classes and alignments. plz send help
@melonie mac go boom  lol. thanks. but I hit my head on the ceiling.
had they thrown the works of tolkien in a taffy puller they would not have been as stretched as amazon is trying to do in justifying their abomination.
they literally dont know how to make a strong female character other than giving them strong male characteristics
get tom shippey back.  nuff said.
I cant wait to see a 115lb 5 3  female warrior take on fully grown 200lb men and overpower them
with how many of these companies take an ip try to adapt it without actually reading any of the source material is appalling.. makes me worried about the upcoming riftwar saga live action being made
amazon actually fired their tolkien expert.I dont remember exactly what his replacement specialises in but I think it was a feminism diversity type subject.
6 04  I guess I was just too old when I watched this movie  but thatscene with galadriel being  tempted  by the ring  was  to me one of the cheesiest scenes in the movie.  the  glow  didn t feel intimidating or awesome  just annoying.  and that thing they did with her voice   intellectually  I get what they were trying to do  but it just looked and sounded bad to me  personally.   honestly  Im going to treat this show like the abomination that is wheel of amazon  and shun it like the plague.
amazon could mess up a wet dream
galadriel is a queen.she should not be on the battlefield to begin with.her specialty is diplomacy and manipulation. she can basically read minds  and bend the will of her enemies. and end a war cause the enemy troops would switch side the moment they would see her and being exposed to her charisma.she said herself that if she would get the one ring  she would not need an army. the people of middle earth would simply love her and despair.
03 26 - hitsong - they are taking the hobbits to isengard - legolas
amazon said that galadriel became  queen  of lothlorien  but she wasn t. the royal line of lorien died out  and galadriel and celeborn  her husband  ruled lothlorien together  but not as king and queen. they refused the royale title. this just shows how uneducated these showrunners are about the lore.
its almost like going in and ruining a franchise is just as much if not more effort then to make your vision that doesnt fit a already established ip into an original ip. crazy.
Im more of a  wheel of time  dude but it was raped in its recent show adaptation so they re related.
1- she was never  hotheaded   in fact  she was one of the few if not the only one thatsaw the darkness in feanor s heart and the dangerous ruin he would later bring. one of the things she was known for was her wisdom and more than once she avoids violence. furthermore  she is one of the oldest elves in middle earth by the tail end of the second age  which is when this feculence of a show is supposedly taking place  so there is absolutely no reason for her to be still a young  hothead .2- tolkien never described her as a warrior in any kind shape or form in any letter anywhere  the most that happens in terms of her committing violence is when she uses her power to tear down the fortress of dol guldur  like luthien tearing down sauron s fortress in the silmarillion .3- galadriel never came into confrontation with morgoth or sauron  nor suffered any attack from them whether by proxy or direct manipulation.4- the power from the ring she would get would be that of a maia spirit  sauron  and the ability to influence and control others  actions. thats the power of the ring  to control the minds of those that wear the other rings  except the elven ones  and influence weaker minds. why is this important  because what she wants is to prevent that which causes the greatest heartbreak to elves  entropy. it is one of the main sources of pain to elves  to see lands and landscapes that they love  changed  unlike valinor. it is why the power of the ring she possesses is that of stopping entropy. but that ring s power is tied to the one ring  and with both in her possession she could have her cake and eat it.  this desire of hers is directly related to what tolkien said lotr was about   but Imight say that if the tale is  about  anything  other than itself   it is not as seems widely supposed about  power.  power seeking is only the motive-power thatsets events going and is relatively unimportant  I think. it is mainly concerned with death  and immortality  and the  escapes   serial longevity  and hoarding memory.   -  from letter 211 in   the letters of j.r.r. tolkien . no wonder tom shipley left the project in unfriendly terms with these people.
holy fuck those tattoos are lit
it felt only natural to us that an adaptation of tolkien s work would reflect what the world actually looks like   says lindsey weber  ...asmon. is popular warrior streamer and nobody plays dumb arcane mages so galadriel used all her billion wow tolkens to reroll. there will be shocking reveal that for a reason gandalf being gay in real life so tolkien surely meant blue wizards to follow suit.this series well be 50  ethnical social justification                                   50  trending topics aka got twilight mosh                                   and the rest to hundred will be tolkiens legacy! im so sad and sick to see how such a mystical piece of art and imagination get twisted beyond recognition by the correctly insatiable ones.
say  how do you feel about going no makeup for the lulz  our bro at midwestly would totes get you a proper roast session
no one should pay amazon prime in september until january boycott them
Im actually impressed with your analysis of this debacle. based for someone who s working at gamestop. weird. xd
by the way did they cancel celeborn
hiya  melonie! literally downloading the original lotr while watching this video!  hobbit one is meh imo.
thing is  in the silmarilion  just like in the middle ages  women didn t go to war  period. you have very few exceptions like eowyn. but most of the time women play a different role  that doesnt mean they are not great characters. why dont use elrond  celebrimbor or gil-galad  all revered warriors  they could even shovel in glorfindel if they wanted to. hollywood is very formulatic  and today the formula is to have a princess warrior  all characters must fit in the designated box.
I just found out  Im off to cry in a corner for 45 mins.... brb
what if Lord of the rings were filmed today. aragorn would be latin  legolas dark skinned  gimlI an asian  hobbits of various colors and frodo and sam would be a couple. only boromir would be white because he dies in the fellowship of the ring.
logolas as a bard and gimlI as a thief
Im beyond angry with how they re treating galadriel. this one change from established lore contextualizes all of the others as malicious acts. they have desecrated this character and spat upon her immense power for the sake of remolding her into the only form of power they can understand. this is no longer an elf. this is an orc.
showrunners just refuse to portray what s in the text opting to give us bs instead. Ive heard the vanity fair interview states that galadriel is  brash and clever    full of piss   vinegar   commander of the northern army   etc. and they emphasize  young  galadriel! whereas the lotr appendix describing this 2nd age states a more mature persona .she s a wife married to celeborn  is a mother raising a daughter  celebrian  and the family spends time living in 4-5 locations before settling down in lothlorien. she gives wise counsel to elven Lords and is trusted as a secret keeper of one of the elven rings - all of this in the first 1700yrs of the second age. in the next 1700 yrs of the 3400  timeline the appendix doesnt state anything about her that I can recall. she and celeborn eventually become the lady   Lord of lothlorien after the death of the earlier regent. but I would assume an elven wife  mother  and trusted advisor  strong willed  prideful  capable of seeing into the minds of others would not turn to frontline military engagement  attacking orcs  donning armor  etc. the showrunners are taking a liberty thinking the audience wants to see this portrayal. they just will not write the  adult  version thats in the appendix because they think the show needs a character arc for galadriel to get to where she s portrayed in the late 3rd age  peter jackson movies.  once again thinking they know better than what tolkien wrote. sheeesh!
exactly no wonder this might be a failure the party is unbalanced.
I am going to disagree with the  character class  argument because tolkien predates the entire concept. if we were to try to apply such a system to gandalf he would cleary be a wizard... except that he is quite proficient with his sword glamdring. feanor was the greatest elven smith of all time... and also a warrior and powerful  mage . yes  many tolkien characters can be fit into such systems. however  that has more to do with those classes being based on tolkien s work  and the same archetypes he drew from  than the other way around. indeed  aragorn was the direct source for the original ad d ranger class... right down to their otherwise inexplicable bonuses for using crystal balls  aka  palantirI  .however  the general reaction is correct. galadriel s  nerwen  days  which were almost entirely as an athlete - not a  warrior   were in valinor. yes  she was  full of piss and vinegar  when she was one of the leaders of the noldor  revolt  against the valar and march on middle-earth. however  when that resulted in the kinslaying  i.e. the noldor slaughtering other elves to steal their ships  she had a radical change of heart... all of which was more than two thousand years before the forging of the rings of power. after thatshe became a student of queen melian of doriath  a maia   had been married to celeborn for more than 1600 years  had been a mother for more than a thousand years  etc...yep  galadriel was different in her youth... but that was a long long time before the events of the story they are supposedly trying to tell.
lotr the rings of power  ya man Lord of the rings the panda rings...
if jackson were worried about woke  he would have changed orlando bloom s character name to legless the double amputee elf. of course jackson was not woke with his movies.these people with amazon might do such a bad job that jackson might finally get the rights to the silmarillion.
someone tell patrick mckay that  no  the rumbling he s feeling wasn t an earthquake - melonie mac d and dropped the boom on his upcoming rings of power dumpster fire. I know it may be hard to tell the difference in la so here s a handy guide for him  if the thunderous shaking occurs soon after you ve opened your mouth to further degrade a beloved property  check youtube before you check with the us geological survey.
yea  say what you want showrunner  but that ain t my galadriel.
you would think it would take a lifetime to learn the magics necessary to throw saron across middle earth.  being a mage or warrior at a whim nah not buying it.
@melonie mac youreally should use the proper title  the wrongs of power ...
God these people sound insane. the creators sound like children coming up with an excuse of why they didn t do their homework. interesting take with the gaming angle. oh  and they consulted with the finest of tolkien academics after firing the original tolkien academics who probably called them out on this.
galadriel is a witch. she is literally called the witch-queen of lorien. she is a genuinely powerful  hot woman that needs her man  because men and women were created for each other.
they didn t get this wrong out of ignorance. they just didn t care.
artistic liberties - an exuse for the mangling of something where it no longer resembles the orignal piece that it was based on. common in flim making and books when the author or director changes the story line  characters  setting etc. to try and draw in more viewers readers. a derogative term in all senses.
what came out they have no rights to a lot of the original stuff so they couldn t do it the right way even if they wanted to  so they should never made the series to begin with or they should have bought rights to full lotor
if you go down the rabbit hole on tiktok its a completely different response to the series than what we are seeing on yt. its quite cringy.
castlevania show did the job of a warrior-mage very very well.amazon just fails and produces a woke shit fest that will make everyone angry that actually likes lotr lore.
haha  they made her into an amazon warrior. how  befitting   -
hey  what if we adapt the silmarillion   but we dont own the rights.  so what  we have the appendices. we can make it all up and write  some of the best stories tolkien ever came up with.   but he did write those stories  you know   shut up and back me up on this. also  I think tolkien was a misogynist  so it would be revolutionary to put a strong female character in the lead. how about lady galadriel  but in armor   but lady galadriel is already a strong female character. and she has no need for armor because...  oh! and young and impulsive too  like daenerys. because  you know  she is thousands of years younger in the second age.  but she was already a mature elf by then.  shut up. do you want to do it or not   well yes. but what if we better consult with tom shippey   no  that guy doesnt give me much confidence. let s fire him and hire someone whoo support us. the lore must be like a rainbow.  rainbow  like saruman s robes   exactly. hey  wasn t saruman one of the bad guys   are you sure you actually want to adapt tolkien s work   of course! dumb question!  you want to make a lot of changes.  thats only because tolkien is for everyone. by the way  have you ever heard  he was a racist
hope your new channel takes
if the show wants to alter the lore that much why not just create a new show entirely   all the beloved classic lore is walking around like a bunch of hybrid creatures from the isle of dr. moreau.   what s next   aslan from narnia is reimagined as a satanic antelope
this girl is too young to be an rpg gamer worth listening to.
you have an illuminated face and wonderful eyes    thanks for your video.
amazon basically does not care about the property that they bought  just the name.  they know that normies will watch because of the connection to the movies.  plus the costuming looks like straight to video c grade quality for the most part.   warrior galadriel s  breastplate looks like some cheap party city plastic halloween costume.
because that armor is looks like from the the witcher universe
dont disagree with you  but would like to point out that many games  starting with d d  have characters that can multi-class  with elves commonly being warrior-mages...as they are immortal  she could have been a warrior for a decade and then focused more on elven magic for the next 1000 years. point is that it is not unreasonable in a fantasy world.  did the writers developers of this show consider this    doubtful and agree that they did it just for their own reasons and their rationale is crap.
I understand the fury of many lovers of tolkien s works  however why does whosoever buy the rights to use intelectual work   asks fans opinion  Imean would be definitely nice and a way to connect with the consumer  but they dont have to if they want.
they made her look like  joan of arc....tolkien would be turning in his grave
it comes all down to this  amazon does not have the rights to the silmarillion  unfinished tales  the history of middle-earth  or any of those other books. they only have the rights to the fellowship of the ring  the two towers  the return of the king  the appendices  and the hobbit. meaning they have to make it all up because they are not allowed to use anything else.  had they made a series about the riders of rohan  or the dwarves  whitin the limits of those stories  they would have been ok. but no  they had to make shit up  didn t follow the lore and make it all woke. its a 1 billion dollar second rate shitshow!!!
morgoth  a God
so essentially nothing in rings of power is lotr.  got it.  hard pass.
galadriel s desire to explore the wild lands of beleriand in the 1st age should not be confused with a personality of  hot headedness  or  piss and vinegar .  in fact  tolkien characterizes her as wise beyond her years and avoiding combat  even going so far as to leave the wars behind with her husband and travel over the mountains into eregion to live in peace.  here s a quote which amazon would find very much in contrast to their betrayal of tolkien s character    she was proud  strong  and self-willed  as were all the descendants of finw  save finarfin  and like her brother finrod  of all her kin the nearest to her heart  she had dreams of far lands and dominions that might be her own to order as she would without tutelage. yet deeper still there dwelt in her the noble and generous spirit of the vanyar  and a reverence for the valar thatshe could not forget. from her earliest years she had a marvellous gift of insight into the minds of others  but judged them with mercy and understanding  and she withheld her goodwill from none save only f anor. in him she perceived a darkness thatshe hated and feared  though she did not perceive that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the noldor  and upon her own. --unfinished tales  part 2  ch. 4  the history of galadriel and celeborn   the only time she comes close to combat is in the third age when she casts down dol guldur  cleansing the forest  after the forces of thranduil and celeborn fight sauron s forces.
yes he is.
just makes me so bloody angry what current day entertainment is doing to the things we all grew up with  love and are still passionate about. enough is enough  honestly. I ll stick to the books and peter jackson s trilogy.
next season  she paints her face red and starts wearing a fake goatee.
Im 35 years old
tolkien    ...  indeed she with celeborn fought heroically in defence of alqualonde against the assault of the noldor  and celeborn s ship was saved from them. galadriel  despairing now of valinor and horrified by the violence and cruelty of f anor  set sail into the darkness without waiting for manw  s leave  which would undoubtedly have been withheld in that hour  however legitimate her desire in itself.    also lammoth and the  cruel hills of ice   which all happen in the first age of endor ...
@bart allen  thanks for the quote  I love that unfinished rendition! two different depictions  both contradicting each other regarding her flight from aman.  did she cross the helcarax  or take a boat with celeborn   was celeborn a telerI or a sindar of doriath  did they meet in aman or in doriath...these are questions posed by using this rendition as canon.  Christopher chose to not accept the quoted rendition that tolkien did not complete due to it restructuring the published silmarillion and changing its story as a result.  either way  she was not a warrior due to defending her mother s people  just the same as you would defend your own home. that makes her a heroine.
@erelasinglor  exactly  _  but  true  though you stated thatshe avoided combat and that the closest she came to combat was during the ta  which isn t exactly correct  dare I say   but yeah  tolkien was uncertain whether he was a telerI or of doriath but regardless either version has her partaking in the encounter in aman -- if I do recall there s around four mentions of this in tolkien s legendarium  regarding galadriel  that is   but youre right that makes her a heroine  but her partaking in the battle of lammoth and the defence of eregion when sauron invades  fun fact  the blue wizards being sent by manwe and orome to rhun and harad delays this by almost 90 years
@bart allen  I would be remiss if I were to say she did not come  close  to combat  that is in proximity if one were to translate it as such.  I should remark by this that Imean she did not partake on the battle lines in the wars of arda in so much as elf women were not want to  in tolkien s world he is specific who  like eowyn  are the exceptions to this  elven women folk were not depicted as warriors but rather their men folk as was tolkien s intent.  to not make mention of galadriel fighting on the front lines would entail that this was not his intent for her  he was far thinking for his day and would no doubt include this should he have wished it.  that being said  both the references made to lammoth  and eregion do not mention galadriel partaking of combat  and while her high position would no doubt lend credence to the thought thatshe along with her family members and husband would direct the armies  even tolkien in the 3rd age states that it was celeborn that led the forces of lorien against dol guldur.
@erelasinglor  I totally do understand what you mean though logically she would have partook in the events at lammoth  and eregion she is mentioned with her husband in its defence
the issue is nerds do not gatekeep.  they memorize 30 000 pages of lore and want to tell you about that one named spider in the 12 dungeon on the 3 level.  now there are these so called nerds that have showed up. they have watch a cliff notes on 6 anime  read part of a Lord of the rings book  watched some movies and now call themselves  nerds . they have a degree in fictional lit or gender studies  and want to help those backwards people learn what the story should be like. the problem they are running into is they finally go around to the huge properties in nerd culture  and there are people who speak the freaking made up languages better then they do their own language. these people know lore better then real work history  and these so called nerds are getting push back from the real nerds who have made things like lotr their literal lives.
before the king. before the fellowship. there was the message. the one message to rule them all. I hope Im wrong  but I expect this will be a horrid perversion of tolkien s work. looks like jar jar abrams made it.
I cancelled everything amazon a long time ago
galadriel was a warrior commander  not a warrior. to simply put galadriel was a politician more than a jedI swordsman piling up bodies on a battle field. even then this is all over looking the biggest detail of all. she was described as a warrior commander during the 1st age.the rings of power to place during the 2nd age. she had already established a kingdom playing the well established political character she is during the 2nd age.anyone who wants to make the argument thatshe was a warrior princess and critique someone else on lore knowledge seems to always forget this massive detail. she was never a warrior in the second age  when is when the rings of power took place.
here suggested by the quartering. like the channel.
first  just wanna say  not bad  I like your attitude towards this  and glad you understand why tolkien fans are pissed. you earned my subscription  dear. when I saw critical drinker s take on the rings of power  I was like  yeah  why dont they make a series about what happened in the east of middle earth   and for my future review of the series  I wrote an improvement scenario that does just like that  what they could ve done if they wanted diversity. basically  its about an haradrim oliphaunt trainer who meets a rebel easterling  rhun and could be a female warrior  who reveals to him the true evils of melkor and sauron  who use their dark influence to have man fight each other  instead of uniting. this introduces the two blue wizards  who were trying their best to unite the men of the east and south  having limited successes  but thanks to the main characters they manage to rise an army while fighting various servants of sauron  like orcs  evil shamans  etc.  and the local wildlife. when the final battle begins  the evil Lord herumor uses everything to his disposal to protect and keep the city of umbar  and when the first wave of his plan fails  he uses a balrog he kept beneath the city  because if this city and country cant be his  it belongs to no one. though the blue wizards  who feared fighting a balrog  had to muster up their courage and protect the bystanders from the balrog  and this I imagine a brutal battle scene takes place  with one wizard being defensive and the other offensive  until they manage to slay the monster by drowning it and stabbing it with a lightning blade through the heart  and nearly died saving everyone. though at the end of the series  after years of restoring umbar  and building a better relationship between the west and east  the two wizards  leave for valar  like gandalf and the other immortals  saying their tearful good byes to all the friends they made. this whole series  would take place at the exact same time as jackson s Lord of the rings trilogy  with the first episode starting at night  and meant to sync up with the first 20 minutes after frodo s introduction. and yes  I had to check out a lot of wikI pages for this story. so thoughts
ah  the supposedly hot-headed and brash galadriel who wore her hair in a braid around her head so she could fight easier sure had plenty opportunity in the first age  like in the 2nd  3rd  4th and 5th battles... only  she didn t fight in any of them. huh. it also would have been nice to have warrior queen galadriel around for that match up against sauron on the slopes of mount doom... fricking cirdan was even around for that  somehow  but not galadriel.these people need to just stop because they aren t fooling anyone. galadriel is going to kick some ass because that is the only way you know how to write strength and heroism and magic is expensive to show and sword is cheap. pretty simple. the damn lore has nothing to do with it.
people should stand up and stop this craziness
Imay add... women like pretty men too. a lot of women like pretty men and pretty women. western games dont have men that are beautiful like japanese and korean games do... the male viera in ff14 are very popular and lots of girls love them for example! women also like women that are beautiful. women tend to like things that are pretty! who knew!  western games dont cater to women at all in this regard. making shit ugly is sure to turn a lot of girls away. the men in lost ark also seem to have very beautiful face options. western games just dont know how to create beauty.
they cant kill it because we will ignore the show just like star wars.
these people clearly just dont understand nuance. not even looking at the books for a minute  even jackson s trilogy made itsuper clear that galadriel was a being of immense power and we didn t have to see her kill a single orc. her power is mystical and cant be easily measured  but it is innate. you can be overwhelmed by it just by standing in her presence. no elf or mortal would have to grab her hair and check her ears to know she is one of the great among the eldar who carries the light of the aman in her eyes.the showrunners really think they re making her  stronger   but they ve just turned her into some chick with a sword.
the writers and producers at amazon are dumber than a back of hammers  and this show is going to be an epic fail of similar magnitude to gallum falling into the cracks of doom.
they thought it would be cool and sunglasses and a cigarette and loosely from her lips would be out of place.
its so nice to see a woman lotr fan actually calling out amazon for their woke garbage that is the rings of power!!
she didnt like her talent tree...so she paied some gold and respecced...
you think galadriel needs armor and an army   take a look at this  https   www.youtube.com watch v lqaslj09neq  that is galadriel not some dull soldier.
excellent vod  mel! galadriel has always been a mage class  never a warrior class or any other class. as far as I know she has always worn a dress  and she most def never wore armor  and tolkien s elves were never hot-headed. why must the woke always make a woman s strength  looks  and personality masculine and get rid of their femininity  beauty  and sexiness ! also  they dont own the rights to the silmarillion and unfinished tales so they cant even make a show for the 2nd age based on canon so they are making a fanfic show instead and they had the gall to say that they could do tolkien s story better than tolkien! even though they are egregiously contradicting those two books and the lore in general! their cockiness  disrespect  and hubris makes me fume! they are ruining tolkien s stories that I grew up on since I was a small child!
considering how much money they threw at this trashfire its no wonder they are starting to panic and grasp at straws.
I think its pretty obvious that the showrunners dont think a woman can be strong or independent unless she s physically kicking ass. which is disrespectful to every other profession  male and female alike.
I hate to judge a show before watching an episode  so I ll reserve final opinion until then. a fool s hope perhaps
... she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the noldor  she was strong of body  mind  and will  a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the eldar in the days of their youth. and ... being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the valar thought fit to give the eldar ...
this is wrong. tolkien clearly stated that galadriel was quite different in the first and second ages.  she fought fiercely against her motherkin against feanor. -she was an athlete-tolkien described her being of amazon disposition.-she was a traveler.-she had a fiery temperwe dont even have to go back in time. while frodo was taking the ring to mordor  lothlorien was attacked three times on march 11  15  and 22  3019. by the orcs of dol guldur. the orcs were defeated.following this celeborn and galadriel led the galadrim across the anduin and into mirkwood they attacked dol guldur.the main reason galadriel has mage like powers is because she posesses a ring of power. she didn t have one in her youth  therefore she had to slog it out like everyone else  though she was clearly talented in everything she did.I do not know why everyone seems to think galadriel always hung out in the forest in a white gown. this isn t even accurate for the lotr books let alone the silmarilion and other books.there s things to critize amazon for regarding sticking to canon  but this isn t it. just admit you dont read the books and like peter jackson s galadriel better than tolkien s.
frodo is tank class  sam is a healer  gandalf is an npc quest giver  bilbo is a rogue ... amazon is a souls boss. all characters are infected with -10 white-male-privilege status effect ... invented poc lgbtqy7h5429a hh    2@pronountwitter-likes characters have  stunning    20   brave    30 and political social shielding   10.all non-white-male characters automatically unlock reparations chest for elite nike air jordan armour and 55  sony bravia tv gear.also unlocked is the  peaceful protest  attack which allows the user to burn down a village without raising alarm or wanted level.fuck whitey dlc incoming
they got the idea of making galadriel a warrior commander because of  the  eye of the commander  in unfinished tales lol...which they dont have the rights to  plus they just purely misinterpreted what the eye of the comamander meaning . galadriel uses magic   she possessed a tremendous amount of magical powers  and was said to be the greatest of the  oldor after f anor. amazon just hasnt go a fucking clue
not to worry this series is barely Lord of the rings to begin with. hopefully it crashes and burns without leaving an impact. it looks more like a college or high school play more than a 500 mill tv series.
they have done and will continue to do the same to  robert jordans the wheel of time.
tolkien s letters mentioned that  she was then of amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats. . which most likely meant she had many of their qualities. like courage  independence  honor  the willingness to fight for what she loves and cares for. and  as mentioned in the letter  competitiveness. what it most likely doesnt mean is thatshe was a sword-wielding maverick.
here is a version of galadriel in armor - the type of armor thatshe would more likely wear than the type of armor shown in rings of power  https   youtu.be qab6z4evmue
the lack of fan input is not a big. its a feature. its done on purpose to insult and gaslight the fan base into kissing amazon s ass.
every wow nerd knows mages cant wear plate.
lotr shouldn t be fire emblem at all  ok. also you cant just change a person who has not be with the pack from the beginning to make them a warrior now for the pack  ok mel. anyway I hope you understand what I am saying to you in this comment  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day   weekend with your parents   with your aunt  ok mel. also I will be praying for you   your aunt  ok mel.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made.  -   j.  r.  r.  tolkien
wait  why would anyone with magic ever pick up a sword   magic is far more powerful.  its why every fantasy genre ever has made them physically weaker  so there d be some kind of balance  to give the fighters a fighting chance.  if they want to make her a mage in heavy armor  or a battle-mage I d be willing to consider that.  bringing a sword to a magic fight is the fantasy version of bringing a knife to a gun fight  except the gun is a flamethrower  and also a nuke  and a flaming sword  and an invisibility cloak  and literally anything else you can imagine  because magic.
amen!
they totally dont care about this character or the lore and canon. galadriel was cool and powerful without being a man in armor. why do these people think that making women men empowers women
look bros  there is no hack writer in woke hollywood that can write married women.
what they dont get is galadrial isn t human and doesnt have human emotions like they try to associate her with. elves that have lived thousands of years will not change moods like a human would. like the writers. the show will be crap.
lotr isnt an mmo  its not wow  confining tolkien character s down to  classes  doesnt do them any justice.
love your content. hot chicks with good opinions are so hard to come by.
evil cannot create anything new  it can only distort and destroy what was invented or created by the forces of good  j.r.r. tolkien
let them play any of the souls games lol.
tolkien    ...  indeed she with celeborn fought heroically in defence of alqualonde against the assault of the noldor  and celeborn s ship was saved from them. galadriel  despairing now of valinor and horrified by the violence and cruelty of f anor  set sail into the darkness without waiting for manw  s leave  which would undoubtedly have been withheld in that hour  however legitimate her desire in itself.    also lammoth and the  cruel hills of ice   which all happen in the first age of endor ... also she only starts using magic - well  the galadriel we know  I hasten to add - in the later second age and start of the ta  based on the previous teachings of melian and more so when she acquires nenya
she fought in aman during the first kingslaying  and logically  too  at lammoth ...
@bart allen  she s a mage  not a warrior. so if she had been in a battle  it d have been as a mage. like gandalf in the trilogy.
@naomI dierckx  nope  thats inaccurate  especially during the first and early second age
right ! ! !
@melonie mac go boom  tolkien    ...  indeed she with celeborn fought heroically in defence of alqualonde against the assault of the noldor  and celeborn s ship was saved from them. galadriel  despairing now of valinor and horrified by the violence and cruelty of f anor  set sail into the darkness without waiting for manw  s leave  which would undoubtedly have been withheld in that hour  however legitimate her desire in itself.
the shadow that bred them can only mock  it cannot make  not real new things of its own. I dont think it gave life to the orcs  it only ruined them and twisted them  and if they are to live at all  they have to live like other living creatures.
comparing tolkien s legendarium to a video game or a ttrpg is extremely cringey.
first of all galadriel is a very loved character.....its somthing the fans actually requested.......im very shocked that a woman is gonna sht all over anoyher womans stpry please with all the power of nenya eat      lady eat pure
these people and anyone that thinks they know what was on his mind are stupid. because if he  wanted her to be a warrior he would have made her as a warrior not a mage. so he obviously wanted her to be a mage because thats how he wrote  her. now when it comes to hot-headed characters. if there plan is to show one that is possibly scary and dangerous because they are hot-headed. common sense says you go with a mage class wich is what she is a mage. because if you have a warrior and a mage you can pissed off a warrior and dodge their  weapon. but if you piss off a mage you cant dodge something that is not a physical weapon. thats why in most video games mages are most dangerous and treated that way. because its easy enough to dodge a sword but if someone controls mystical forces. how do you avoid mystical forces thats why in games like dragon age. mages are treated like they are because they  more dangerous than any other kind of person. because if you have a army of people coming at you with swords and shields. they are  easy enough to stop at long range. but how do you handle one mage that can summon blizzard and things. from miles away they dont even need to see you to attack you. so taking a super powerful mage then making her a common everyday warrior. makes no sense in any way shape or form. because if they wanted to show her  as a strong character she was a super strong mage. they actually downgraded her when they made her  a warrior. any person on the street would agree with common sense. ask anyone who is scarier a person with a knife or a long-range weapon. magic being the  ultimate long-range weapon people would go  the person with  the long-range weapon. because you have  to be up close to stab me. but long-range you do not need to be up close to do harm.
maybe in season 2 she changes her gender and identifies as an orc.
por que tanto odio con esta serie  dejen que nos cuenten una version diferente. peter jackson  estuvo bien  pero el tambien se tomo muchas libertades creativas incluso cuando tuvo a su disposicI n 4 libros  me refiero a la trilog a del el se or de los anillos y al hobbit   donde se nos describ an sucesos de forma m s detallada de lo que sucedI  en esa edad. ademas  la segunda edad es una  poca diferente con personajes y situaciones distintos a los que ya estamos acostumbrados  por otra parte en la segunda edad solo tenemos ap ndices y descripciones de apenas una o dos p ginas lo cual  te da mucho margen para inventarte cosas no puedes hacer una serie de 5 temporadas con 2 hojas de los ap ndices es obvio que muchas cosas no van a ser canon. y sI se quejan de la inclusI n  forzada  yo creo que ya es tiempo de que el cine y la televisI n le den espacio a otras culturas y mitolog as de otras latitudes del mundo  la am rica precolombina o africa por ejemplo eso sI ser a una verdadera inclusI n. el problema es quien ver a una ser a o una pel cula de otros pueblos y pa ses  cuando estamos muy europeisados  .... mucho n rdico mucho vikingo mucho  eurocentrismo.
mages are cooler too and bards are annoying af
ugh. its just gets worse and worse. this could have been a pay pig for them too if they just followed the lore.
the Lord of the rings is not dnd.  its is extremely cringey to call galadriel  a mage .
why cant they just come up with an original idea instead of trying to rewrite existing fandoms
it is insulting to masculineize a woman to make her stong and feminineize a man. why cant galadriel be a strong feminine woman who is in a loving marriage  let elrond have his role back as a leader to gil-galad s army.
lol! galadriel is not a mage. she became  if anything  an elven seer after accepting nenya and founding calas galadhon with celeborn. she does not  wield  magic as the istarImight. her power comes from nenya and her gifts of insight foresight for preservation of elvendom in middle earth. galadriel wielding offensive magic as seen in the hobbit is complete bullshit. nothing in the canon indicates this to be credible. nothing. as to being a  warrior   thats very open to interpretation  she s thousands of years old. how do you think she survived the 20yr crossing of the helcaraxe when hundreds of her brethren were slain by beasts or perished in the cold  of course she has worn armour and wielded a sword at some point in her long  long life. where I would take issue is the notion thatshe s been some sort of field commander against morgoth.

the criticisms in the video seem to come only from the perspective of the peter jackson films  without much knowledge of all the books.   and  in case people dont remember  peter jackson s lotr was viciously attacked by purists when it came out for its deviations from the source material.  but anyway  some things legolas the bard you say   actually legolas sang a number of times in the book the lotr.galadriel isn t  a mage.   galadriel is one of the noldor  and also of the telerI through mom and the vanyar through grandma .  noldor essentially means knowledge.  they learn everything and are good at everything.  and tolkien called galadriel the greatest of the noldor  except feanor maybe.  tolkien says she was wiser than feanor and and she grew in wisdom over time.  so  yes  I would expect her to be less wise at the start of the 2nd age than at the end of the 3rd age in the lotr which is more than 6 000 years later.  as for the  warrior  stuff  the showrunners discussed in the cited article could have done a much better job.   they might start by noting how peter jackson was viciously attacked for putting a sword into the hands of arwen and having her confront the nazgul.  galadriel is a much better match for holding a sword.  reading the silmarillion and the unfinished tales gives a much fuller appreciation for galadriel. she was one of the leaders of the revolt against the valar in aman and wouldn t stop even after the kinslaying and the threat of the doom of mandos unless they turned back. she was filled with pride and a desire to rule her own kingdom.  the unfinished tales says she  fought fiercely  at the kinslaying against her own kin the noldor in defense of her other kin the teleri.  was it with her bare hands   its the idea thatshe couldn t use a sword or wear armor that contradicts canon. her mother named her man-maiden. tolkien called her an  amazon  and said she matched all the  athletes  of the eldar. again  saying she just wore pretty dresses  cast spells  and handed out gifts is what contradicts canon
a hotheaded female protagonist in a show made in 2022  no way! I have never seen that before!
when one lacks creativity then one tends to use the creation of others and adds irrelevance to it and thus ending up with a bastardised version  that bears little resemblance to the original.this is what is happening in the woke world. no wonder people prefer manga  anime  and foreign films and series like squid game  the kingdom etc.also they ruined great games such as tomb raider  battlefield series etc. all in the name of wokeness.
galadriel being a warrior is one of the many retcons done on this show. proof that these people dont care about the lore or the story  they just want to insert their diversity and politics. I came to the conclusion a while back hollywood wants to destroy our favorite franchises  the ones we grew up with and fell in love with because they hate us the fans. this show is going to crash and burn hard and everyone knows it.
welcome to the jungle. sheh nanana nee nee.
would tolkien really approve of all these dorks in 2022 who think lotr is just wow  you might hate rings of power  and yes  it looks awful  but you have to admit peter jackson s movies are just as far from tolkien s vision as this series.
gooooo boooooom!
or in the final season she changed her identity to an eagle
@jasontheking134  its so exciting
tolkien    ...  indeed she with celeborn fought heroically in defence of alqualond  against the assault of the noldor  and celeborn s ship was saved from them. galadriel  despairing now of valinor and horrified by the violence and cruelty of f anor  set sail into the darkness without waiting for manw  s leave  which would undoubtedly have been withheld in that hour  however legitimate her desire in itself.     also lammoth and the  cruel hills of ice .
the thing is  tolkien isn t the generic sword and sorcery fantasy that a lot of people seem to think it is. there are no  mages  in middle-earth throwing fireballs or shooting lasers to avoid  close combat  like one of your commenters seemed to think. the  magic  is connected to divinity and angelic beings  and the term  magic  is mostly used to simplify in the minds of lesser beings the advanced elven technology like the elven cloaks  elven rope  lembas bread  and pertinent to this topic  the phial of galadriel  which draws its power from the divinity of earendil s star.now  galadriel s  magic  abilities are not well understood  and its not clear what is intrinsic to her and what is given to her by her ring of power  which she wont have until later on in this show. but generally  her abilities include the ability to communicate telepathically  some level of foresight divination  connected to her mirror  again  elven technology   the power of preservation  and something which enabled her to  undo  the foundations of dol goldur  likely connected to trees and nature  from when she was yvanna s pupil  or possibly connected to the ring of water . none of these seem likely to be useful in battle  except possibly the mysterious dol guldur-ending power  but we dont know what that is  and itseems unlikely to be something she could just whip out mid-battle. so if she was going to be involved in a battle  she was probably going to be using a sword and armour like the rest of her people.also  almost all of the important elven leaders who were known for their  magical  abilities were also shown to be competent warriors and or commanders  like feanor  glorfindel  elrond  etc. and the most well known magical being in the story  gandalf  also didn t shy away from using a sword on the frontline. they could do both  and there s nothing to suggest that galadriel couldn t either. its never made explicit thatshe was a warrior at some point  but is thatsuch a problem  its not inconceivable  so I dont see it as being something to get angry about. to me  its a lesser evil than making arwen a warrior in the Lord of the rings movies  because that definitely was not canon and couldn t be explained.there s plenty of stuff that causes me concern about the new show  but this isn t one of them.
the focal character of a loathsome  soulless production expressed designed to inculcate normies to propoganda
hey I want to tell mario puzo there are too many italians in his book and remake that. while Im at it  I want to remake cujo with a gay chihuahua.
Im already imagining the new languages they will come up with...  the language tolkien never created...   but wanted to . they re so arrogant... they should be humble before tolkien s work.
its not  Lord  of the rings anymore  cause Lords can only be male. its rings of power now
boom boom!!!!!!okay  I need a cold shower.peace!!
apparently amazon doesnt own any rights to tolkien s work lol so they cant even make the show represent any of the lore if they wanted. which they dont. they have already said they think this fanfic trash will be better than tolkien s own work. its all such
boycott amazon
galadriel never fought in the middle earth battles.  being athletic  doesnt mean youre a warrior.
this production lost all credibility when shippey left.
amazon pay thru micro transactions to avail class change
5 50 nah bilbo in rivendell was worse  d
hmmm short vid  still great though
multiclass!!! lol
she s a stronk wahman  she can do everything better reeee !
thank you for pronouncing tolkien correctly toll keen also  I saw an ad on this video so your channel isn t new anymore
11 00  3
you are to cute and based not to succeed.
since when vanity fair is the place to discuss tolkien  but its not about tolkien at all...
galad-fake
thank you! like of the book long list of problems in the trailer galadriel  being a warrior during the 1st-2nd age isn t really an issue.  a lot of tolkien scholors and even tolkien himself considered her a warrior first  before maturing and such. she is also considered the first female leader to lead a group of rebels across the cruel hills of ice where the were attacked by morgoth where she took up the sword. like I have so many problems with this show and Im sure I wont like galadriel with how they interpret her  but just making her story warrior focused is just a small liberty in my opinion
its not lotr if you just make up your own stuff.
cancelamazonlotr
I just went boom too.
this is how things are corrupted - missrepresented one detail that isn t explained in detail 1 to 1...
why dont you just make your own lore at this point wtf  ! !
minute man missle project brat. 26 states before I was 16. some more than once.
amazon is putting out this garbage and increasing member price. ok  im done with them.
I d rather watch twilight than this show  even without the rifftrax guys talking over it.
lotr  cringe of power.
jeff bezos should have stayed in space and away from middle earth.
thats cos they want action like game of thrones..her being a warrior makes her weaker she s an ascended mage whose op..she could still have a elven sword  or a bow but use her magical powers..I can smell batwoman all over this or last jedI  its a no from me
hot headed  young  do they not know how old she is  she was born not long after the awakening of her species. by the middle of 2nd age she s 5 000 years old!!! young   hotheaded  roflmao
no one complained when she was a warrior in the hobbit. is it because they have some black characters in the series
the more they talk the worse it gets.
what they are trying to cover up is how unoriginal they are. the  warrior woman  exists in virtually every action picture by now and is a standard trope heading toward being a cliche.  they didn t even try to understand who galadriel was. all their talk is after the fact and a smokescreen to cover the fact that they just made a cookie cutter hollywood action picture .
um  why are you mixing up tolkien with ad d
I will celebrate when the rings of woke fails.
Jesus what a babe
funzies lol
dumpster
the whole trouble with this show is that they bought the rights to Lord of the rings  not any of tolkien s other works... so to do a pre-lotr show all they have are some references and the appendices. freakin  idiots bought the wrong rights.
its not the Lord of the rings what amazon s doing its the gender-neutral nobility of the cringe
young   she would be 5000 yrs old at that time. a warrior in nothing Ive read. nor brash. and elrond is not described ever as a politician.
the truth is readily apparent  a lie must be vehemently defended.also  nerds are the future.
they simply do not have the rights to all the books. they only have the rights to the lotr trilogy  the hobbit and the appendices. thats why they are writing their own bs. they cannot use any of the original material... which is a complete shitshow because they are completely hiding that this is not an adaptation
you got at 11 08 !!
yeppp! wheres her fuckin magic!!
ahhhhhh  why day do dis
Im canceling my amazon subscriptions
in the world of woketarians strong women are in fact men.  the irony.....
well these people are so narrowminded and dont get the most simplest things of things. someone was referred to as some amazon  omg get the stereotypes! we got ourselves a strong  independant woman to film! give her armor to emphasise on that! Lord of the rings  jeanne d arc - lets go!like their brains are physically incapable of comprehending that you can be amazon-like while still retaining your  class . a piece of bread would be more inventive and creative than these people
what s next  they will try to tell us that dwarves did not have beards yet   in books its clearly stated that dwarf women are barley distinguishable from men !
we dont want a hot-headed huffing and puffing and moaning and swinging a sword around galadriel. ffs. thats not the image of her in any book
they shouldn t be allowed to use the title Lord of the rings if they re making itso different and not following the story. just another lazy exploitation of established stories characters in order to get their unrelated messages out
never seen a company spend billions to get cucked by a fictional reality before.faith to source for the win.
hey tolkien estate  I recommend you never sell any lotr rights to amazon ever again. they are disrespectful clowns.
xena galadriel  the warrior princess  is an absolute downgrade. this show is the most expensive fanfic ever made... and nothing else.
they re not going to stop  just walk away. let no one watch this fake lotr series and let it fail  let amazon burn away the billion dollars its wasted on this fake series.if you want to hurt amazon even more shop online elsewhere  walmart would like to match amazon s online sales. yeah I know walmart is just as bad  but they aren t making woke versions of favorite fan franchises yet. I know no one really want to deal with china but alibaba isn t really that bad  just like walmart they aren t making woke versions of franchises either.
the way I see it with all this weird casting race changing  gender bending etc. I see it as having a turd in your food you just ordered  its not something you d even want to eat around  everything is spoilt by the presence of the turd.
threw me for a loop to here the Bible verse.. not used to hearing scripture in the nerd community.
I dont like tatts on chicks!
women cant be strong based on intelligence and faith!  how dare you!!
the amount of time they spend into killing a series and put nonsense out of their ass about the series should be spent on researching properly or better yet staying in their lane and not make anything! no one asked for this series  if it ain t true to actual lore and the original I dont want it
gotta have a strong warrior woman for sjw points duh
go boom  ok boomer
liberties . ha!
they ruined wheel of time and how their explanations for the changes were terrible. rings of power will be worse.
isnt it kind of sexist to assume that armor and a sword makes you strong .. she is one of the mightiest and wisest beings of middle earth  like an earthly Goddess  barefoot..  notarantino
they probably made her a warrior because plastic armor is cheaper than cgImagic. they are so effing lazy and cheapskate. this show isn t for tolkien fans. its for people who liked the last season of got and last jedi.
these changes are along the lines of changing the white whale of moby dick to a black whale. because... you know..... diversity
amazon believes they can create a better story better than j. r. r. tolkien. what a sad woke joke!
not even a spellblade huh... just a warrior... normis
if I play as an ugly character.  they are the ugliest character in the game.
they should have worked with real tolkien people not these woke wana bes. galadriel is already was very powerful women and I would never wanna piss her off. we see it 2 times in the movies once in the hobbitseries when they come to rescue gandalf and the second time when frodo offers her the ring. so not only is she a powerful mage but she is already a powerful warrior elf so them claiming to be making her in to one is total bullshit. she never did the things they are doing with her. hell they might as well say at Christmas  smog would fly out and scatter gold coins from the mountain horde on the towns for good little boys and girls while wishing everyone a merry Christmas
love all the gaming and movie stuff  but wish you would talk more about conspiracies and who is engineering these social issues. you need to look at the top and follow the money..
wow nerds would pay 60 bucks for a class reroll. it just costs some gold to reroll your gender now lol
this person in this video plays world of warcraft and now they think they re a tolkien expert.
I dont mind a warrior galadriel  gandalf used a sword .the writing  and acting are just so poor. I would rather watch xena without a doubt.
ohhhh boi
cant  speak ill of the tribe.
this person comments on a youtube video and now they think they re a tolkien expert
proverbs 22 28 remove not the ancient landmark  which thy fathers have set.
smells like simps in here. also   youre about it   no thanks.
I dont mean to disrespect the new actress that act in gallagriel character but she is not as beautiful as the original actress kate
at the end of the day  its all make-believe.   if you dont like it  boycott the show  milksops.
amazon sucks
how dare you criticize a strong wahmen !!!
mages are bad @ss . how cool would it be to balnket a battlefield wth flames or strip away the ground with lightning creating huge storms as the electricy homes on any one waring armor. thats awsome. warrors are boering .
is this a joke  are you saying its bad because she has different  class  which is definitely how lotr world works  Im not saying the series is any good  but your point is just rubbish.
crowned isn t a reference to braided hair blahblahblah. it just means she her head had shiny hair. crowned means upon her head. this is what they do though. they take little things  or things that are implied but not specifically described and interpret it as subjective  and distort them to fit their overall narrative. tolkien work is not subjective. none of it. everything is implies with objectivity. tolkien was an objective person. it was his moral foundation. he was freaked catholic. not modern catholic either. old school catholic. and there are no dwarf princesses or queens there are practically no female dwarves and are barely mentioned. and for good reason. its called mystery. the dwarves are the most patriarchal group in middle earth. so get fckd on the female dwarf princess.
Im not interested in watching  this. its not lotr.
Imean who cares what gamers and nerds  by that I dont mean at smart people  think. this was just bad and wrong idea  total false interpretation one of the main character of the story. you dont need opinion of gamer or nerd to explain that  you need only to be person with common sense.
wow  so bigoted to not tolerate galadriel being trans-class  s
comment!
hi
most expensive bullshit in history...
watch this trash only on pirates sites  dont give amazon your money
dot
are you trying to gender lock classes   that would have been problematic in 2012 but it 2022 its not only bad  itseems your ignoring all the progress we made in the last decade surrounding the representation of women.
the best thing we can do is not watch this woke rubbish  its completely inaccurate to tolkiens source material. I wont be wasting my time watching it.
another cringe gamer girl...
almost no one is tho to be fair lol
just more amazon woke garbage and its a flop. a lot of wasted money and time.
this is absolute trash  will be not watching this.  should probably cancel my prime subscription in protest.
