thank goodness the helpless protagonist has a strong independent woman to protect him!
I love that meme where itshows  ww3 breaks out  then next frame it has all the feminist in the kitchen smiling. Imiss society were things were based on merit and character. Imiss gender roles. Imiss comedy were there was no safe space. Imiss traditional values.
brit trolling shia leboof is one of the funniest things Ive ever seen. if you haven t watched the hwndu  he will not divide us  stuff she did  you gotta check it out you will laugh. its magical. she s a legendary troll with a sharp wit and great sense of humor.I was a moon knight and gambit kid in the 90 s. I just hope they make khonshu absolutely bonkers. I have almost no expectations though. Ive been let down so much with d  shows.
hImelonie  keep giving your thoughts  opions on many topics.Im so stoked on seeing you being sohappy with your new channel.takecare melonie
everybody seeing everyone as human beings. let s call that  the human revolution . we even have a slogan already  I never asked for this.
if you like reading books  dresden files by jim butcher is pretty good read...  its amazing how all these studios are able to create and introduce all these awesome storylines...
mk is great he s like a mix of batman punisher mysticism very fun character and eliss s run was fantastic highly recomend it.the show is solid so far I like it.on another note would you care to share some of the conspiracy theories you happen to believe I think it could be a fun video.
when we were kids  we were more concerned with playing outside with our friends. we didn t  and still shouldn t  have to listen to a teacher talk to us about things we cannot even comprehend at that age. that just seems creepy.
thank God for this channel. one of my favorites. you are amazing mel!
I was such a fanboy for midnight sons and marvel knights back in the 90s as a kid  and Imust say im pretty excited so far for moon knight  looks awesome and oscar isaac will kill it im sure  havent been too hype for any of the disney  shows lately but  this one! dude omfg constantine was so baller!!!!  being a fan of the hellblazer comic and justice league dark
Im in the same camp as you  when it comes to liking darker themed fantasy but I did grow up catholic.  when it comes to comics  spawn  ghost rider  and constantine.  I liked the constantine movie  along with shows like supernatural and lucifer.  its all interesting.  sometimes dark.  sometimes corny.
I totally agree about the feeling that the  activists  dont speak for an entire community. honestly there are entirely too many people who claim they are  activists  of some sort but they dont actually do anything of value to further their cause. all they ever do is complain on twitter or facebook and they think that equals activism. they all complain about shit but they dont actually do anything to try and create real change  like trying to pass legislation for their cause. most of these outspoken whiners are the loudest of a small minority. the majority of people just dont feel the need to push their opinion on others and would rather try to work on real change instead of just virtue signaling on twitter. and the phrase I like to use is  the vocal minority does not speak for the silent majority .
yes melonie... constantine is one of my all time favorite movies.  even before I was born again in Christ  this film resonated with me.  probably because it depicts the constant battle between good and evil so well.  the vast majority of this war is fought in the spiritual realm.  satanists  pagans  witches  warlocks  shamans  fortune tellers  tarot card readers  etc. all understand this very well but many Christians fail to see the importance of spiritual warfare.  thats why the Bible commands us to put on the armor of God in order to survive this evil world we live in.my favorite part of the movie is the scene where john constantine  keanu reeves  explains to angela dodson  rachel weisz  how the devil is the root cause of all of the evil in the world.  angela responds with the follow line angela dodson    well  this has been real educational  but... I dont believe in the devil.john constantine    you should. he believes in you.  mic drop
melonie and brittany have a 10 minute segment in the video she mentioned  where they talk about a moba. its the best. thing. ever.
just found your channel today.  wow  what a breath of fresh air from a past games journalist!  I have to agree with your view that children shouldn t be on social media.  Im the father of five boys  ranging from toddlers in diapers to one learning to drive  yeessh.....   and they are not allowed to have their own social media.  in fact  Ive been moving away from that 21st century drug myself with a few exceptions here and there.
the stream was fun to watch  too bad it ended abruptly at an interesting conversation
thats cute when melanie realized they were in a tomb   she wanted to go raid it.
I lol ed at you saying  are they in a tomb !  you seem to always have tomb raiding on the brain.   edited  also  I agree with you that kids shouldn t be taught sexuality that young  and that they should just be allowed to be kids.
love underworld and looking forward to moon knight for sure.  just hope they dont wokify it like they do with everything else.
honestly Im just never surprised with the world anymore. like I try to help others  but Ivery rarely help myself. even to my own detriment. I even try to relay to others to  help me help myself  because I know myself well enough to know I will never help do something for myself  even if I am running myself ragged and even been in a couple of accidents as a result.so when people say  seek help  my reaction is  why bother   because its like it always people expect me to do something that is almost impossible to do because of my disability  asperger s . even then I am doing good for others long before myself. I am aware people say that I am not obligated to say on what I have  but I dont speak up on that once a moon  who will
@scott mcmahon  yeah  he legit just looks confused and is trying to figure out what s going on while she s trying to get him to run. he s not being protected  she s just clearing a path for them both to go
dude the personality oscar is portraying  steven  is a character that is vulnerable  confused and cant fight to save his life. if you cant get that around your head then I dont know what to tell you.
lmfao great comment
it has been a lot of time from this moment  but what did you think of the show
@kaI levil  I didn t like it very much. it just wasn t for me.
im the same. im a catholic  but enjoy the dark mystic style if that makes any sense. I also think the moon knight suit itself is pretty cool. never heard of his character. im a marvel casual  but still its cool to look at.
I look forward to seeing you on fnt this week mel  remember that while ryan may make fun of you for being a woman  he wont make fun of you for being native american.... actually he s such a chad he d do that too lol.
ventI is a real one.  hope y all become good friends!
mel  being brits big sister. keep her safe  mel.
this was an interesting clip to watch
gotta admit  with all the garbage the world is throwing in our faces  Ive concluded that I am gonna be homeschooling my kids if I ever get to have that life changing experience.
the book of elI was another gem as well.
the hellboy comic books are some of the best experiences Ive had thus far...
as to the  activists dont speak for all of us ... there was a huge twitter push recently for disney workers to strike because of the doesnt say gay bill in florida... the media says lots of people striked  but there was only one striker in florida  all the rest were in california  and they were more striking against the idea of having to move to florida...
I enjoy most of the underworlds and a couple of the blades.
my only gripe with this  is his mask as moon knight. I really like the smooth mask from the comic. however Im still interested.
the only monster or franchise I want to see crossover with Godzilla is with gamera. thats one of my dream films that I want to see one day is a  Godzilla vs gamera  movie. dont get me wrong im a huge Godzilla fan  not only is he my favorite giant monster but his series is my personal favorite franchise of all time. but gamera is a close second and I personally think he would be a worthy rival to the king. also I think that the fight between the two would be intense  if you watched the gamera trilogy from the 90s then you know what im talking about.
hey melonie I just want to say that moon knight movie series will be awesome and great than a normal movie. anyway I just cant wait to see the series and see how it is on disney plus  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that to have a wonderful and great blessed evening and a great week and weekend with your family and have good night too  ok melonie.
to your point  yes there was stuff that happened to those communities in the past. the activists want to act like no progress has taken place or they re worse off now. anyone living in an objective reality can determine things are significantly better. more people are waking up to the reality that it has nothing to do with equality the more they push.
morning macdrop!!  fun stream last night with brittany!
I appreciate that you gave an honest opinion on this clip and that you aren t afraid to put up negative comments. I think we could all benefit from taking a pause before  jumping on the hate train. I ll wait for context before hating on this show.
I have many months of disney  content to watch...and I fully intend to get most of it from the library after its being sold on bluray etc. xdI look forward to moon knight  but yeah  probably a long wait for me to see it.
yes let kids be kids! we are making them grow up way too fast!
as a big moon knight fan  I am hoping and praying that disney doesnt ruin this.  I have read and still own every series of moon knight.  disney has pretty much screwed up just about every marvel property they put on disney .  lokI was trash.  falcon and winter soldier was woke  racist garbage.  what if  was borderline.  scarlett witch was alright.
loving your work...
first!!!
I really feel like you went into each of those shows negatively. I thought lokI s pilot sucked  but the rest of the episodes were actually fantastic. falcon and winter soldier was really good and they handled the topics of race and patriotism impressively well. scarlet witch was so good until the last couple of episodes basically ruined it. I thought hawkeye would be trash especially after watching its bad pilot episode  but then the show got better. its still probably the weakest show  though.
for sometime moonknight has been the only marvel comic I consistently read minus that unbelievably bad bendis run. but the show has me worried cause the accents seem like a really lazy way to demonstrate multiple personality disorder.
hImelonie   I just wanted to know  what are your thoughts on halloween   do you celebrate it  also Im trying out tomb raider underworld for the first time  and as challenging as it is  its pretty great.
one of my best friends is a gay man who is a very masculine male and most assume is straight. his husband is your stereotypical gay as portraited by hollywood. it is always funny to watch women s faces as they see these two walk holding hands and obviously in love  their disgust is real! they get a good laugh  as does the rest of our group.
ok just watched the trailer and yeah that looks effin cool
love your videos
Im down. oscar isaac  ethan hawke and the rest of the cast look to do a lot with the show. should be fun.also  based on that clip  does that technically make ethan hawke s character a...tomb raider  ehhhhhh  thanks  melonie.
I have a movie suggestion for you. the crow starring brandon lee. love the content  and all that you do. stay faithful  strong  and go boom!
after fnt Im sure your channel will get quite the bump
halo had 30ish percent spartans  rabbit and the sniper chick spartans were awesome characters in the books.
why is melonie so beautiful and ageless
constantine was a great movie. I ll watch any keanu movie.
happy they doing more of a true thriller with this one since black widow was a huge letdown
I love the tattoo on your left shoulder... that is all.
keep doing ehat youre doing
I want to see moon knight vs apocalypse
I wouldn t want to see a jaeger beat Godzilla either  but ultraman s another story  especially if its a more recent ultraman  like x  orb  or trigger.
I hate it when scenes are filmed in the dark so that the director doesnt have to spend money on electric lights.  it might as well be a radio play.  my other pet peeve is when they rush the action by you so fast that you dont really see what s going on.  another pet peeve is when they allow special effects to carry the movie instead of acting and storyline.  special effects have ruined movies.
100  agree social media is not good for the children of the world.
on the female halo spartans  they should call them amazons
5 36 I want to see Godzilla versus the new world order.  also maybe Godzilla versus the nephilim.
dude the bendis run still haunts me. I have the holographic foil cover though and its the only good thing of his stint. I get the feeling the show will have the shallowest take possible of multiple personality disorder. like  tumblr self-diagnosed mental issues bad.
can we let the show play out first
the crow is life! lol! have youread the graphic novel   it is darker grittier  and more brutal than the film!
@metal discipline  I have it and have read it  sadly I did not have it with me when Imet james at dragon con.
@moandain designs  oh wow  thats neat that you got to meet mr. o barr! I bought my copy 20 years ago  and still have it  its one of my absolute favorite graphic novels next to watchmen!

@dying rose  watch your mouth.
@audiogardenslave
melonie reading my comment made my day your amazing. btw Im team Godzilla hes the one true king .
what s the name of that video game restaurant ! and where is it ! itsounds awesome!
if memory serves  there were female spartans in the books
Im not that bothered by this clip. moon knight suffers from multiple personality disorder or whatever its called these days. here he s in his steven grant personality. in the comics grant is a rich businessman. in the movie he s apparently a  mild-mannered gift shop employee  that I assume is working in a museum with some sort of egyptian exhibit or wing. either way I wouldn t expect grant to be a bad ass. what I imagine will happen is that they ll get chased around by the bad guys and just when it looks like the bad guys are going to win  the marc spector  an ex-special forces mercenary  personality will emerge to deal with the situation. because cliches are a thing.
I just watch to see your face smile
I love how disney is advertising all the marvel tv shows coming to disney plus  as if they re new  as if disney didn t kill half of them throwing their classic greedy temper tantrum  and as if they re doing us a favor by adding old shows that a good portion of the fan base has all but given up on. Imean  really  when is the last time we saw something original come out of disney  rather than an acquisition or the like
you should be on fnt as a guest
are they in like a tomb   ugh oh  wait for it....  so anyways like I was saying  tomb raider...  lol
are you familiar with the work of dr. michael heiser  the unseen realm  and the naked Bible podcast   you ll appreciate the Bible s theology   ane historical background  and literary context in a better way
when does this new cw show come out
I was listening to youread a comment from a previous episode about actors playing certain roles and I had a shower thought. speaking completely out of pocket  but when elliot page  ellen  has a socio-political rant on social media  does anyone reply to him with  be quiet because the opinion of a rich  white  privileged  toxic male is invalid.
as a big moon knight fan I was turned off by the many apparent inaccuracies in the first full length trailer  but the second one explained quite a bit. Im on board.
ayooo she has an inner goth
when someone accuses another of being  homophobic   are they being accused of fearing a human in latin  or fearing the same in greek !
frizzy-haired female poc in the very first shot tells you all you need to know about the show.
as Christians  we know there s light and dark  angels and demons  fallen angels   and we know God has a plan to win in the end. plus  tolkien  and c.s. lewis to a point  wrote fiction that could be dark.
its pretty simple   moon knight  is acting confused and scared in the clip  because he s not actually  moon knight   he s not even mark spector  he s steven grant  an alter-ego. and steven is not moon knight  he s just a guy.. so  yeah  from steven s perspective  weird shitstarts happening for no apparent reason  in thatsituation anyone would be scared and confused...
go boom!!
thanks for being neutral with this clip melonie. I watched az s video from heelvsbabyface. and seeing his over reaction to this one clip that we barely even have context for  its like he was looking for something to get mad about. I dont even dislike him. but his reaction was just odd. the people saying that the girl beating on the dude who was twice her size need to take a step back and realize that this is just a comic book world. can y all not be so up in arms over something so little
right by their fruits labor  you shall know them.
I will be on friday haha
@melonie mac go boom  really hell yeah cant wait

@qqq  hahaha great movie reference! I have pissed some off when I have asked that question where they play mental gymnastics. haha
az is scarred for life after the damage from reviewing all those seasons of cws batwoman. for his outlook to be initially negative  is expected  by he does admit when he s wrong... if this show does...if. let s face it   disney does not have a good track record.  lol
@icepicjoey  yeah I know disney has been screwing up lately. book of boba fett was lackluster to most. wandavision  tfaws  and lokI haven t been that great either. black widow was just ok. eternals was a failure. but that doesnt mean that everything they ve done has been bad. hawkeye is an underrated gem imo. shang chI  regardless of what others say  is a solid film. I just think we need to be careful to not apply the  woke  label on everything we see otherwise we become no better than the politically correct mob.
I honestly dont get the problem with this. its not forced feminism or anything. the steven grant persona was never a fighter and has no idea what s going on. marc spector moon knight is the fighter. so seeing a woman that probably has some form of fight training and knows what the situation is  it makes sense.
Im a little upset that I wasn t called a boomer at the start...... oh well
my verse of always   15 in my futile life I have seen both of these  a righteous man perishing in his righteousness  and a wicked man living long in his wickedness. 16 do not be overly righteous and do not make yourself too wise. why should you destroy yourself. 17 do not be excessively wicked  and do not be a fool. why should you die before your time
indiana moon raider and the temple go boom...
1. change your phone s password2. congrats on your milestone 3. big fan of your perma-smile

and there s tomb raider.
I have a 16 year old daughter who has been brainwashed and indoctrinated since she was 10.  I try to talk to her  but it falls on deaf ears.  she is consumed with identity politics  representation   and race when it comes to tv  movies  and even comics.  I ask what that has to do with anything. I ask her why should a good story be sacrificed just to appease certain groups.  she cant give me an answer.  its like talking to a wall sometimes. she get all of her info from the internet and what she is being taught in school.  there are a lot of leftist   woke teachers at her school.
7 50 I want to see the rock playing gay hitler.
wud up go boom!!!
day 19 prt 3 of commenting on your videos until g fuel sponsors me. Im so done with marvel at this point.  its too much  . but I love how you even pick out comments that are toxic on your comments of the day just to trash  em

Imight pass on this
moon knight - mercenary gets killed  resurrected by egyptian God. has did. kills people.
I love uuu
nice
35yo masculine gay man here. youre 100  correct. we do exist. I spent six years in the military  I deployed to afghanistan twice as a 68w in an airborne unit. Im interested in cars  both import tuners  and muscle cars. I own and shoot guns. I drive a pickup truck. I listen to a lot of heavy metal music  and a ton of gangster rap. I like to play violent video games. I love dark   macabre movies  games  comic books  etc. oh  and I am also a Christian. I dont like feminine men. I would not date one. liberals love to tell me I am homophobic. I usually reply with  so  was I homophobic when I  redacted  my boyfriend  am I homophobic when I go gun shopping with my boyfriend  are we both being homophobic at the shooting range  what about when we go out to car meets and hang out with people in the street racing scene  and we are the only gay couple in thatspace  are we still homophobic   these liberal types cant seem to understand that gay men like me  and my boyfriend exist. I cant lie  its kind of a lot of fun watching them get angry that we dont fit in their little box of what gay men are suppose to be.
oh shoot I probably typed my password in front of everyone loool! thank you for the kind words
wait till she goes out on her own. she ll realize how the real world works and will hopefully change for the better.
refuse to pay for college. simple.
Im sure this sentiment is not shared but Im a bit over the hollywood live action comic book superhero adaptation... I d rather watch a quality animation of the same.
one thing to say...never take the mark of the antiChrist beast!
morning!
didn t antI sjws cancel disney
more female spartans than male   has this person ever played any of the halo games  there are 4 or 5 different female spartans. maybe look into things before posting something like that. and if you pay attention to the trailers and preview for the new halo series they showed you 2 of the female spartans.
I cant stand the lead actor s voice  he sounds like a high-schooler on the trailer I watched.
just look at this scene and this little girls beating up wave after wave of men  just rtsrded Im not sure how people can get excited for stuff like this when we all know that its just going to be used to push bs agendas and idealistically it will be mediocre at best yet you still want to pay money and support this garbage and horrible disgusting corporation. at the very most  ifmyou cant help yourself please just pirate the show  if enough of us stop mindless supporting disney and the trash they make we can make a difference . the first step is believing in ourselves  when enough people choose to that and take the respective action we can manifest changes..   	stop supporting disney   and any other corporation that hates your our existence  especially if you consider yourself a comic  game  etc. connoisseur   enthusiast  or true fan of the subculture.  why  because this corporation hates you and has destroyed these ips that we were all once huge fans of and are now weaponzing them against us in this culture war psych war we find ourselves in.  how is disney doing this    they make content designed to push agendas and indoctrinate    subvert the masses   but especially consider the fact they are going after the children   your children. they are attempting to demoralize us all  through media because they understand how important and culturally significant media is to americans especially a generation of americans who were raised by tvs. dont allow them to demoralize you  once your morale is gone  and you have no fight left is when things get worse. if you think you cant make a difference  what you do doesnt matter   and are potentially afraid to do something different  stand up for what you think etc. then the demoralization has worked because when enough us start making changes and doing this different it goes beyond just an individual effect and now a large group is making change and potentially influencing the followers   the sheep  or the people to insecure or lacking that bit of courage to do something. 	which is why it is more important than ever that creators and influencers help drive this change  contribute to the movement  speak out  and be the force for positive change or if you so wish wreaking havoc and chaos on these oppressive corporations and the establishment that is being used as a weapon against all of us    .
and   I am Christian too and I love all dark and grim wibes in games and movies. and movies like first underworld or blade are the best. this dI ney kids friendly shit is not for me.
dont have to work in a religious comment in every video....
sorry for me no matter what they try to do. marvel is dead to me and ended at end game.
this looks awful
Im not watching moon knight its going to be a bait a switch this is trash show
a woman cant throw a guy thatsize  has that dweeb never heard of judo  -boom
