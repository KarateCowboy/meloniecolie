Im a latino guy and my favorite director is akira kurosawa. you know how many latinos appeared in kurosawa films  0. none of the characters in his movies spoke the same language as me  none of them lived in the same country as me  none of them lived in the same time period as me  but I could still enjoy the films and get invested in the stories they told.I really dont understand the woke s need to see themselves represented on screen. I thought the point of entertainment was escapism  itseems like it would be very unfulfilling to limit yourself to only watching tv shows where the characters look like you.
Im a black woman and I prefer redheaded ariel. her race shouldn t matter as much as her character. also samwise does a lot more for me in terms of looking up to a character than the don lemon elf or the black lady queen. he helped frodo get to mordor and back. he was just the gardener.
the most telling sign of the representation narcissism is that the goal is for little girls to say  wow! this character is just like me! I am just like this character!  instead of  wow! this character is so cool! I wish we were friends and could hang out! .
I think its narcissism  because many people push this stroke their own egos and also racism. but they do it in a more around about way and by blaming people who notice it  which is pretty sinister.
back in the 90s  the little mermaid animated series had a mermaid who had darker skin and she also couldn t speak so she just used sign language to communicate. when you wish upon a starfish is the episode you need to see to know that disney already had a darker skin mermaid back in the 90s and they didn t go out of their way to preach it to you.
35 here too. I grew up being told to treat everyone the same  no stereo types  no praise or degrading people because of immutable aspects. now thats all they demand   treat us differently because we re different!
so happy youre speaking out. you hit all the points that needed to be said!
lol so true melonie. the show  rings of power  is so boring. I hate it when people use the  now I can see myself  line. shows like family matters  fresh prince of bel-air  I didn t need to see myself to enjoy those show. youre right about the anime part as well. lol I hope your cousin isn t like  melonie what the heck!  enjoyed the video and how much thought you put into it. you look great melonie. take it easy melonie.
the part that drives me nuts is that hollywood is erasing decades of great black entertainment and entertainers so they can condescend to everyone by pretending that they are  giving  certain groups something they didn t already have. as if minorities need a white progressive savior or benefactor in order to achieve anything. its so unbelievably racist  and yet they get away with it. I loved 80s and 90s movies. ever see the last dragon  or blade  movies like these existed long before black panther  and they were not in short supply. so sad to see hollywood erasing the collective memories of these great films so they can pretend that the crap films they put out now have any merit at all.
I am of indian origin. I relate to sansa   dany because like them I was a trapped young girl being thrown into an uncertain life. I also relate to pre netflix yennefer because I have a somewhat similar past and felt the stuff she felt  I never needed her to be my ethnicity. none of those characters look like me. hell when I watch bollywood or tollywood I dont consider the characters there as  myself  even though they have the same skin  hair and eye colour as myself.
Im an asian male and many of my favorite characters are white  regardless of gender   and many of my favorite movies primarily white. over the years  Ive developed a knack for movies between the 1930s to 1960s  though Imaintain a soft spot for the 1970s to 1990s  with only some exceptions from the 2000s onward. I also enjoy watching anime a lot. in video games  many of my favorites are also white or white-looking of either gender. in games with character creation  I always go for a blonde or ginger with blue or green eyes and very fair skin. thats just my escapism fun. the  now I can see myself  thingy is just boring and uninspiring. very shortsighted thinking and assuming that people in general just look up to figures  real or fiction  that only look like them or their kind  instead of character traits and qualities. just basically promoting racism  stereotyping and segregation.
the topic of  representation  has always felt really weird to me  because Ive never felt  represented  by any character on anything. there is a lot more to me than white skin and blond hair  so the idea of feeling in some way legitimized by a character with similar physical features to me is absurd. by that argument  when I was a kid I should have thought guille on street fighter 2 was the best  because he also has blond hair and white skin  but I was never in the military  Im not super buff  I cant move my arms so quickly as to make a projectile weapon out of breaking the sound barrier  so the differences seem greater in number and magnitude that the similarities.
imagine only liking characters because of a physical similarity instead of  you know  character traits. lmao
girl thank you so much for making this. I feel exactly the same  and I think its also arrogant and entitled to look at someone elses art and demand that they put a visual representation of you in it. art isnt about you  its about the creator and their innermost feelings  passions and culture. this is why the rop is such an egregious slap in the face  because anyone who reads the works of tolkien knows that this is the literary artwork of someone who cared. every story was personal to him and was an expression of his experiences  feelings  passions and culture. he took that and he made something beautiful. and right now  to me and a lot of fans  it feels like they want to take that away from us and preach to us about what we should be enjoying. its just sad. I really hope this whole tokenized race-swapping crusade comes to an end.I didnt like it in the hobbut movies either. at no point while watching the lotr trilogy did I think to myself  hmm  this is great but it needs more women in it for me to like it . I didnt ask for nor want a female elf in a story where there wasnt supposed to be one. and it ended up being a huge distraction to the story and what made itspecial. I just hate that people assume that the only way someone can enjoy something is if they have someone who looks like them in it.
its so funny I d just come to this conclusion earlier this week. well done! as a black kid growing up  I loved luke skywalker and han solo. I despised lando. if someone would ve told me I was  supposed  to like lando more because we looked alike  I would ve told them to get outta my face. representation is indeed narcissism.great job and thanks again!
ah a fellow halfsy! same thing with skin color here  I can get dark! in my experience its not about what I look like though  but more about the culture I grew up in. it was mixed culturally and I cant fully relate with either side of my parent s cultures  so the parts I relate to mean a lot to me. Imiss the world we grew up in where skin color didn t matter to anyone.
its really sad how stereotypes are now being twisted to woke media. I grew up playing with barbie with my autistic older sister. most of my cousins were girls and only had one male cousins. I played with stuff I had access too.
one of my favorite characters is chell from portal  she a person who never ever gives up and stays strong even in the most hopeless of scenarios. I look up cosplays and I can see quite a bit of black people who do cosplay of chell  Ive even met some and they said thatshe was like a hero that they looked up to.
galadriel from the original lotr movies still gives me chills when she does her test of will when frodo offers her the ring.
its crazy that they want people to fit in boxes  follow strict stereotypes  while pretending to do the opposite.I liked belle when I was a kid because she was curious  smart and capable  obviously it had nothing to do with how she looked liked me because she didn t  it was her personality that made me like her and identify with her.kids nowadays are told to like heroes for things that are so superficial its kinda sad.
you have great taste! kurosawa is a genius.
no shit. my favorite movie. is seven samurai!
high five. and well said.
but kurosawa films were created to represent and pander to japanese fans and audiences
this is a disingenuous argument. calling for more diversity implies that one wants to consume entertainment where everyone doesnt look the same  which implies that many characters will not be of my race.
hell yeah I love seven samurai
yeah normal people feel connect to personality but seems these people dont have any so only thing they caan relate is skin color.
or how about   oh  this person is very interesting  I d like to become like him in some aspects . not only is it possible to relate to many different kinds of people at the same time  its also possible to learn from all of them. but that kind of common knowledge seems to  progressively  get lost.
characters Ive connected with the most dont necessarily look like me. might have similar hair  or brown eyes  because thats common  but its usually more about personality. I dont pick favorite characters by their appearance or how similar said appearance is to me. thats honestly weird.
nah
@jarno brofelt  not true
@pandaman  nah
@team tundra 2  ya
@team tundra 2  it is true. found the narcissist.
@blacklives orblackvotes  truth is not  narcissistic
covert narcissism as opposed to overt narcissism. its rarely intentional  more of an automatic functioning of the defense system embedded within their psyche
@nomind  so like auto pilot
@crimzon nova  yeah I know a few people like that.    I generally dont refer to them as narcissistic just delusional. but I ain t any dr.phil or sigmund fraud.
very well said.
I know man  same here. it is so odd.
wow  gorgeous hair!
I only ever watched the a team because I saw myself in mr.t. he looks  talks  acts and shoots stuff exactly as I do. I also identify with that hologram bloke off quantum leap.
word! I watched fresh prince in my youth and saw the reruns sooo many times   and I look nothing like them and ive never cared about that.
imagine being upset that the little mermaid is now black instead of white
@josh cramer  I got no dog in this fight  but... dang  bruh. thats pretty racist against the dutch.
@josh cramer  why not  telling people that they can better relate to a character due to their skin color is very problematic.
@ninjagold  except nobody says that
@remus ventanus  I know this is a troll comment but I just want to say dutch is an ethnicity  not a race
@knowbody  probably a troll comment but hair color isn t a race
@josh cramer  why cant redheads be a race redheads are also a small minority. so  that makes it much worse to erase them.
@josh cramer  how dare you attempt to discredit the glorious dutch. sounds like a bigot to me tbh.
@knowbody  making racial jokes  ah man  white privilege over 9000
@josh cramer  I ll sell you my  white privilege  card  it hasn t done me any good.
@josh cramer  anyway  do you consider japanese  chinese  and koreans to be distinct races  or do you just consider them all to be one  asian  race
@knowbody  japanese chinese korean is a form of ethnicity.
@knowbody  its probably never stopped you from being hired at a job due to your name or hairstyle. thats a pretty good card.
@josh cramer  nobody s ever hired me for my skin color.
@josh cramer  you ve just offended japanese  chinese and koreans.
@knowbody  I dont think they can see it that way  in his mind itseems he is right and nothing we say will make him change it. or its a paid account designed to stir us up like an emotional pot  either way its sad and messed up.
@josh cramer  you tried. you failed  miserably  but you tried.
@theredheadwiththread  I dont think so  I think he is eaten up with  I wanna belong  syndrome.
@mr. stupid universe 731c  basically he s a pick-me lmao
@josh cramer  you seem to be pretty alone whit your opinions!
@jarno brofelt  I d expect that in the comment sections of a youtube channel that targets right wing people lol
there s no way I would like any hollywood movie. bc Im sasak race from indonesia. there s almost no indonesian in hollywood. even in indonesian movie my race almost had no representation. so I guess I can only enjoy local movie which is very little.
yes  which is why I dont understand why people get upset over gender and race swaps.
@ninjagold  why get upset over race swapping
@remus ventanus  mermaids have an ethnicity
@cyberpunk reader  because its low effort pandering.
@jarno brofelt  Im pretty sure all entertainment is pandering. you forget its a business
@cyberpunk reader  tell me top 3 times when people have loved race chance  great business!!
oh man I get you on that. I dont fully identify with my white heritage or my native heritage. but at the end of the day we are all just humans anyway  we dont have to be confined to a box. the days of not seeing color need to come back  it would solve a lot more problems than these stereotypes do  because most of us dont fit into a stereotype
@melonie mac go boom  Imean tbf that whole  dont see color  thing never existed. colors will always be a thing and have their own distinct cultures. and people will always prefer those like themself. thats just how it is. there s e exceptions here and there but for the most part thats how it is. thats why outside of the us most countries are homogeneous. they prefer their own  simple. and there s nothing wrong with that. its trying to act as if we can all be  equal  when in reality said ideology is spoken by people who are just envious and want to be in power over the ones who are currently in power in the world. which are white people. its jealousy  plain and simple.
I love chell. she s one of my fave game characters.
@priyana varma  Im probably old enough to remember chell s mind videos waaaay back in the past. and Im 23 now  lmao.
we have to bear in mind  its not just narcissism  its literally policy at amazon.
representation -written characters are doomed from the start because the writer of that character does not understand what draws people to characters. of course  there s nothing like a  good cause  to bring out the worst in people.
its racism.  teaching kids that the only way they should be able to enjoy a show is if there are people with their skin color in it is incredibly racist.
I used to argue that if rop really wanted to include representation while staying true to tolkien s descriptions of each nation  they could have depicted haradrim. but they already had a plan for that  basically depicting the haradrim as a bunch of bumbling white racists  though still not quite as racist as the white orcs who enslave the black elf . honestly  was it too much to ask for nuance also  these shows are not going to help girls ethnic minorities grow up with positive role models  in part because many of the protagonists are terrible people  and partly because they re so forgettable.
agreed and especially with the live action little mermaid movie cuz people pointed out in the comments that in the 90s cartoon for the disney movie they introduced a black mermaid named gabriella and that they could ve easily put her in the movie to star alongside ariel instead of race swapping her and that probably would ve gone down a lot better than race swapping a well established character in the form of ariel.
I grew up in the same generation you did.  I can attest to the fact that we were taught that what matters is more than just skin deep.  a persons character and the way they treat others is far more important than the color of their skin and what s between their legs.  I wonder sometimes why we got away from that
there s a difference between being proud of yourself  and thinking everything is about you.  I think just in general  narcissistic behavior is loosely interpreted
galadriel in the lotr trilogy was beautiful  ethereal  powerful.....but my favourite was  back then my husband  legolas. I agree  all this activism is creating narcissism. also  since when do we need to have an identical skin colour  gender etc to love and maybe even relate to a character  I tend to look at a characters personality  things they overcome etc.....not their skin colour or how modern girl boss they are. oh I feel you with hisoka! I love him so much!!!! albel from star ocean.....I do not look like either of them and yet....shock horror  I can still love them! im female and a red head with pasty freckled skin and none of my favourite characters look like me! one of my favourite female characters is tifa lockhart....I look nothing like her but  apparently thats wrong now! pfff. I was and still am a tomboy. I dress quite masculine but I am a woman  if I was a teen or younger these days  people would be trying to convince me I was trans. uh  no
so much truth melonie. I saw this exchange and almost commented on her tweet where she said nothing stops the boys from seeing themselves in the  female characters. Imean  come on  why cant girls see themselves in the male characters then  some of my favorite characters as a kid were roadblock and storm shadow. apparently Im not allowed to like them though since Im not black or asian  or the ninja turtles since Im not green looking forward to the stream tonight. kc is always fun to watch.
I agree a 100    back in the day when I was a kid we really didn t care too much of who you were. as long as you are cool thats all but really mattered.  I grew up in new york and and to us we all were different shades of colors it didn t matter. it is true that it is these narcissistic children children that live in a country where there really no problems compared to other places that have to manufacture thing thanks. these people are so miserable with their lives they they have to basically make everyone else feel bad. here s a thing about it I didn t know about your background and really its not important. Ive seen your channel couple of times and saw that you had good contact  so I started to following you. thats what matters matters. that youre a good person  you give good contact  and you have common sense. and thats what we all should be looking at everything else is window dress. please keep up the good work
keep bringing use amazing content melonie!
one of the best things about stories is getting to see the world from the perspective of someone born into very different circumstances than you -- whether that means a different world  culture  gender  race  class  etc.
as a kid my favorite character was gimmlI  you know  the guy who was used as a joke. as I grew up I started to like gandalf more and more until he became my favorite character. even though I shouldn t be able to relate to an old man. but thats not why I liked him the most anyway. I liked him the most because he was this overly kind person who was mentoring and respecting everyone despite being a maia  which could have made him feel arrogant  like everyone is an inferior creature. thats pretty much what saruman did. his compassion and wisdom while still having his funny side made me really like him. more than a person who s experience I can relate to  I loved gandalf because he was like a role model I d aspire to become like. thats also what I liked about galadriel. but rings of powers of course made sure to take away every quality from her that made her likeable to begin with. amazon needs to understand that you dont need to be the strongest  wisest and most awesome person to be the favorite character of the audience.
I ll out myself  I played with barbies too because I wanted my gI joes to have someone to come home to hahaha. narcissism is exactly what these ppl are encouraging. its absolutely terrible that they cant love things that they cant see themselves in. I cant watch anything new theses days lemme tell you. great video  keep killin  it. I even got my wife listening in going  omg girl tell it!  hahaha
sometimes melanie  you speak too intelligently  d love this. absolutely a1 on everything. its almost as if the shareholders that are all now 50 60 years of age are trying to push through agendas to make more marketing consumer segments  when  the majority of us between the 25-45 age demography have been used to so many inter-cultural identities for the past 20 years. think of the travelling people have done since the beach to go explore. so many of my friends  relatives  their friends  relatives have travelled the world  lived and worked in many countries. good people are good people  we dont need to be pushed into specific segments. we just like good people for being good people.in the same context  tv movies are good for depicting good people for being good people - not because they are of a specific background or ethnic origin and having to push political ideals. I also find that pushing these - and I completely agree - narcisstic agendas - what happened to the signorney weavers  the uma thurmans  the pam griers  helen mirren  prime suspect is brilliant   zoe saladana - can go back even further to identify strong female voices in hollywood before that  then denzel washington  sterling brown  will smith  wesley snipes  lawerence fishbourne  jamie foxx - all these characters  and just off the tip of my tongue   have almost been completely cast to the wasteland for the breakthrough work they have done.we just want stories in these tv shows movies to be actually well written and the best actor to be selected for that particular role and not just a check-box category. checking the box and having to fill out demographics  removing meritocracy is so transparently bs and actually breaks that 4th wall in a terrible way. case in point  tip of my tongue  jack reacher is 6 6  and tom cruise depicted him. it flopped and he was replaced by alan for the tv show. why  because the character and actor were two completely different entities.love your content! thanks and keep it up!!
narcissim  100  and I will never fall into that. when you see the truth of things  you gotta speak out on it. great video melonie!
Im a female  pansexual  latina  and some of my favorite characters that I related to weren t necessarily pansexual  latin  females  but I didn t care  I dont give value to a person by only their color  sexuality  and gender  I value people by their personality and character.
I was taught that too. about the seeing who they are on the inside and not judging someone superficially or categorizing them like that. exactly like you said and that we didn t need to worry about that at all. I have characters I love in comics and games that are black  hispanic  etc... I didn t like race swapping in multiple other things. I read tek war when it came out  and when I watched the show I was excited about  I was upset they made sid black  cause he was hispanic but overall just went with it. I have some esoteric comics even. to me  and what I was taught  this thing they are doing now is racist. in fact I was taught thatshowing additional favor to someone cause of their skin color  instead of treating them like I would anyone else was reverse-racism and that that was just as racist. that we should just pay attention to someone s heart. and let me tell you  these days I see a lot of ugly people...
I think an important thing to note is that this narcissism comes from insecurity. they want reassurance. they want to be seen as valid. so while everyone is trying to push how everyone is stunning and brave  it preys on their insecurities and doesnt really allow themselves to feel comfortable with themselves. praise becomes a drug that these people are dependant on. these people pat themselves on the back for being progressive any telling everyone that they re valid  not realising that their own woke movement promotes insecurity. if youre overly concerned about how characters look like  thats not empowerment  thats insecurity. compound that with how people are more dependant on technology and their social skills have been sacrificed and how they re bombarded with criticism over every little thing  there s no wonder why things are all out of whack.I do think the race gender baiting is completely unethical though. especially when it goes only one way which created friction and I think the people at the top pushing this know that.
Im in thatsame age group as you which is maybe why I find all this woke stuff ridiculous. my parents always said to  treat everyone the way you want to be treated.  skin color  gender  whatever  it didn t matter. thats what Ive always done. now people are inventing all these qualifiers and its too much. cant I just be friendly  am supposed to hold the door open for you or not  it felt good to just help people and likewise it felt good when someone helped you out. you didn t have to watch videos on youtube to have faith in humanity restored. we ve really rolled backwards down the hill and no one is even watching.
agreed.
thats partially true but I also understand that different races have somewhat different experiences. it depends of where you live of course and the culture of the different people depicted. there are aspects of chris from everybody hates chris  that I relate to particularly in that he has a strong  hard headed father who is very meticulous with spending money  and aspects that I dont relate to such as having to deal with the stigma of interratial dating  which happens to him in one episode  and having someone make fun of your race. he s s great character nonetheless.
no one is preaching that  this comment section is insanely lacking of critical thinking skills
@josias sama  lot s of people are. do you live under a rock
@chrislikescandy  no but you live in a bubble where there s obviously extremes being talked ab. calling this racist is just a defense to people affected by lack of representation calling lack of representation racist but I didn t expect you to understand that cause of the critical thinking issue
@josias sama  lack of representation is not racism or racist at all. I think your lack of thinking skills leads you to believe other people have a lack of critical thinking skills.
why do you have to bring up race can we just have fun
@arcane gg  I was pointing out that amazon had an out where they could avoid not pissing off everyone  but they didn t want to take it
@spitshinesneakers   if the season hasn t ended yet you dont really know where its going yet and somehow you led to race its mad suspect my dude
a well made show set in middle earth s harad could ve been great.  would like to see something like that.  although I still dont have much faith in modern hollywood getting their priorities in order.
@chrislikescandy   its racist for kids to be taught its okay to have representation of themselves in media  lack of representation is not racism the hypocrisy and stupidity is impressive
@josh cramer  no one is saying people s races shouldn t be seen onscreen or in other visual media  just that its lazy to give other races sloppy seconds  instead of making original characters. go off  I guess though.
@gray wolf  huh
@gray wolf  well the us is an easy place to be a traitor to when itstands for shitty things also idk if thats in the communist manifesto but imma take your word for it but Im like 90  sure its nit
@gray wolf  I didnt take your word for it  its not
@gray wolf  right wing incel insults dont really hold much weight
kind of hard to run character through a market research computer program. it has long since been observed that race and gender correlates with other factors but it is artificial stupidity to think that correlation equal causation  although humans did make such errors a few generations ago .
I have always associated with the story arcs  trials and tribulations through which the various characters are defined and grow. its always the story and never the actor that I identify with.
oh yes  they re all right up there with eowyn - the 5 invented for the show  the two irish stereotypes  the one who believes she s going to change the world by acting  the one thatshouldn t exist  and the one who doesnt care her village was destroyed   the one thatshouldn t even be queen yet  and the living embodiment of rbf
you ve got an interesting way of looking at things.  I feel like a lot of the anti-woke content I that used to enjoy has lost all sense of nuance and has delved into levels of absurdity where every sentence is filled with a wahman or reee.  never even thought of looking at the representation issue as narcissistic  but when I think about characters that I enjoy they cover all races  genders and spectrums.  I never felt like I had to identify with their looks to feel connected to them  I felt more connected to their actions or personalities - which is how I think itshould be.  kudos to you for being one of the few content creators to see this.
I will say that we grew up looking at these characters as what they were  characters. I never saw  myself  in these movies or cartoons because I understood that it was a story. people these days want to see themselves in these movies because they want to feel like they are special.
this on point. I kind of find it funny that I related mostly to darth vader as a kid and I really dont wear a helmet 24 7. still do so it truly is narcissitic to want to see yourself on screen.
critical drinker made a recent video about  fan baiting  which is pretty damn accurate. studios are doing this on purpose to create the perfect ratio of manufactured outrage to get people talking about their new movie show while looking like the  good guys . they have this down to an exact science. in their delusional minds  this strategy is a massive  win-win . they think it makes them look  progressive  and  brave  while  getting desperate validation on twitter. meanwhile  the loyal fans who voice any displeasure or concern with seeing their favorite character  story  or franchise being desecrated  are called names.not going to lie  it activates my almonds. growing up  I was lando from star wars for halloween because I loved his character. I would be absolutely furious if they replaced him with a disabled  insert race here  lesbian in a wheel chair because  muh representation .
I freaking love your takes on stuff like this! your commentary is the best!
well said. I really hate hear  look like me  narration. why they re need to see the character as same race to relate to   Im indonesian and I dont have any problem relate or sympathize with lot s of hollywood movie characters. I love wreck it ralphs for example bc I kinda relate to vennalope bc sometimes I feel  being different or weird  like her. I can relate to her lonely feeling. and Im not really relate to ralphs bc his loneliness more bc he s seen as the bad guy. but I can understand why he did what he did. I can feel his anger. man  I love those movie. in other hands  another movie that marketing as more representation or at least more close to my culture  raya  I dont like that movie. the story itself sucks. and I can see the south asian inspired in that movie  but I cant really relate to any character or empathize with them. Imean  all the shit is just happend bc they re stupid. and the stupidity is just cant be justified for any reason. how can I empathize and feel for those stupidity. it make me feel those movie just made for the sake of marketing it to south asian people. cant they fell it  its made look like you so you f buy it! you  your race just be marketing object! they respect it at all  bc if they respect it  they will make a good movie with it  they will do research of your culture and make something good with it. in little mermaid especially its clear that its just use black people as marketing object. if they really care  they will make amazing princess and frog movie. btw I love that movie  and I hate live action remake. so I kinda glad they dont make it another lifeless live action. but  if they really care  Im sure there s a way to make a good disney princess movies bc basically its human  so it can be life action someway. not like lion king  you definitely cant make a look like life action from that movie.
first time on your channel.  your take is 100  on point
you are spot on.telling the truth if you are right will often get hate. spouting nonsense will get you either ignored by all  or acclaimed by the sjw narcissists if they can use you. happy new year
Im a nigerian man and my favorite video game character is a blonde hair  blue eyed white woman  samus  . I dont need a character to be my gender  color  race or ethnicity for me to enjoy.
you are 100  right! that is all can say about this  I could not agree more. representation is good  and avoiding racial stereotypes most certainly is desirable  but to force representation of our real world into a high fantasy world is just plain stupid and childish.
I suspect the biggest challenge some of these lost sheep are having is that they have to default to identity based judgments for themselves because if you try to use character-based judgment the reality is most of them have no idea who they are or what they actually stand for so in a sense they are actually devoid of any kind of character to be judged by.
melanie  you need more subs  love your content!!
thank you melonie because only thing they re doing is segregating each other even more.my reason is live action version of a successful animation film is trash.its like having a live action lilo and stitch based off in jamaica because of  representation ...its dumb and hilarious .
I think itstarted with the custom avatars in games. you can change the hair  skin color  eyes  etc. it was cool at first  but now we have this  everyone wants to see themselves everywhere.
I think this whole identity politics stuff is perfectly lampooned in community s01e06  football  frminism  and you  when the college is trying to come up with the perfect human being mascot. I dont want characters I can relate to  I want characters I can aspire to  but itseems hollywood cant write characters with any virtue or values anymore .
the fact they would think karen sue galadriel is  a strong female role model  tells you all you need to know about them.
very well put melonie.  I cant think of a single point to argue.  thank you for putting your perspective out there.
just because someone doesnt look like them doesnt mean we cant look up to them
idk I dont even make my characters look like my uglyass but I always where a helmet or mask if possible. I spend more time making a female character and with males I just make them look averagely attractive and then I slap a helmet on them most of the game
if I really want to be  represented   it would be me on tv. just saying. but my favorite characters are nothing like me  even my own created characters are nothing like me.
Ive thought this whole thing was narcisim all along. my favorite hero growing up was spawn -- I thought he looked cool and I liked that kind of story back then. the guy looks nothing like me and I never cared nor thought about that part of it.
my favorite character of all-time was a korean  w  split personality who attempted to murder his friends on multiple occasions. another was an onion-looking creature. another was bo jackson in tecmo bowl.
I always thought people saw themselves in characters based on their actions and sacrifices  not their skin color. who knew .  though I will admit  you do kinda look like lara croft so maybe you did see yourself in one character in that fashion.
I never owned dolls but when my cousins where around I played with them I remember always turning the brunette dolls into lara croft  fun memories .
5 16  only blonde white girls are only going to relate to eowyn  points to warrior galadriel a freudian slip we can all relate to
I grew up with the ninja turtles in the late 80s early 90s.they all had green skin  but we all had a favourite! it was about character personality!
when I was little I related to Godzilla.   while my bedroom looked like he lived there   my mom s opinion  I was severely challenged by hight.  that in no way kept me from how I felt. while nowadays Imay  look more like him   more a aspect of the life I led  I no longer identify with him so much. still a fan of him though.
about black girls liking asian culture  I being a latina  I feel way more attracted to their culture than mine  in brazil ppl are too social too close  like too much parties  but in japan  ppl are more closed and less stucked together  feels just perfect to me
beautifully said melonie  .
when I was a young boy  I use to buy barbies to make fantasy character figures  now I 3d print and custom paint.  being a native apache 29yr old 6ft 4in male  I do not care about being represented  I watch and read what I like. the more these people try to  represent  different cultures  the more the we become divided  I related to characters like mulan  hercules  quasimodo  samwise  static - virgil hawkins etc.uniting as a people does not mean accepting we are all the same  it is realizing that none of us are the same  and accepting the differences and moving forward.
very well put mel  spot on!
gen x - dont judge based on color  gen z - the only thing that matters is color
people dont read anymore.  yea  Im old.  I grew up when there was only basically 3 tv channels.  I saw tv shows go from b and w to color  granted I was pretty young .  but we had to read for our  get away .  there wasn t much other choice.  sure there were movies  but growing up  that was a special occasion.  the point being we created the writers words in our heads as we read.  as such we identified with the actions  thoughts  beliefs  personality of the characters.  its a trait we carried forward even when eventually the story was portrayed visually.  it is why today  I can identify with well written characters  regardless of race or gender  even sexuality  to a point .
definitely agree and this how I grow up as well why or did the world become like this.
I had a neighbor who always came over and asked if I would play barbies with her when I was a kid. I liked hanging out with her. I think she was older than me too
first video Ive ever seen from this channel and Imust say she makes smart points. good arguments  good logic and I agree. good video!
what  youre different from those characters that you like  so youre telling me that you aren t an amoral psychopath just going around looking for a good fight like hisoka  then how can he be one of your favorite characters!  if you dont see yourself in him how can you like him so much!
I love several different characters that look nothing like me  but  they re still enjoyable regardless of what they look like. for instance  Ive been watching cardcaptor sakura and one of my favorite characters from that is kero  a demiGod type being who looks like a small teddy bear with a lion tail and wings. one of my favorite characters from dragon ball z is piccolo  a green alien who s incredibly muscular and can regrow limbs and turn into a giant. I also relate to squidward from spongebob  but   Im not a bald squid with a big nose. I look nothing like the characters Imentioned and I cant do anything they do. the point of fiction is escapism  not realism
yup this is so accurate. I was in middle school when the original lotr films were coming out and my favorite characters were aragorn and legolas..meanwhile Im neither white nor male  Im an armenian female
oops  I swear  she feels more like a discount eowyn than galadriel baha!
thank you for saying what most rational people are thinking. Im tired of this childish and entitled behavior from dummies and people being so scared to say anything
characters Ive seen myself in while watching movies  james bond  rick deckard  john creasy  thelma   louise  flik  spider-man  shaft  robert mccall  jiminy cricket  ripley  drunken master  axel foley  wall-e  funny  but it wasn t the stuff I see in the mirror that I saw in these characters on screen. I didn t see myself in their skin color or in their sex or even in their species. funny how that works.
one of my favorite characters of all time is arya stark. Im a 43 year old man  she may have been 18 when the show ended. I couldn t relate to her remotely. she was one of my favorites because she was a bad a on the highest level.
Im 27 white male growing up I love lilo and stitch as I could see myself in lilo as I was bully in school and found it hard to make friends and my home always had dogs.  I have an irish wolfhound   2 dachshund now  growing up I love watching eddie murphy movies. what I have notice is when an community make s new story people outside that community who love the story s start appreciate that community growing up racist behavior was on the way down because people where enjoy black culture with their movie  show  music and games. now hollywood is taking the european culture and replacing the characters with black people and making people and destroying to meaning behind their story s. what is now increasing racist s behavior towards black people because there taking other people culture and not respecting them. now the younger generation love anime and manga and love japans culture what is removing racist s behavior towards asian people.
my brother   I grew up with 3 female cousins around the same age and we all played with barbie s  played pretend doctor   school also watched all the princess movies ect.. but we also played with hot wheels  wwf toys with the arena marbles the list goes on. guess what  we didn t questioned our genders not once because that wasn t even a concern  we were just kids having fun.
I identify with japanese culture more than my own country culture and I look nothing like japanese  also some of my favorite characters are a cyborg guy with an exoskeleton a tall white haired psychopath with a long sword and one black wing  a green alien slug from space and a space monkey human hybrid with a tail that canturn his hair gold and transform into a giant monkey  and I dont look like neither of them  well at least I think I dont look like a monkey
keep speaking your mind its what we need in this world.
agreed. you said it very well.
Ive always been fascinated with mexican culture  especially when given how closely related to native american it is. I have yet to understand why so many people here would rather wall it off and pretend it doesnt exist.
maybe hollywood is representing their people. with she-hulk  they re adapting building her to represent what one of their fans who is crying about representation would look like.
you make a really good point. never thought about it like this.
girl  just be honest. you are a vampire.maybe a Christian vampire  but still immortal somehow!
you dropped this  queen.
you sat through three episodes ! I cant even get through the first. the first thing I said  screamed  is elves dont act like that! I think I woke my neighbor.
lol. God Im old  I had too look up what a pick me was. the next time some one calls you a pick me  just politely say  thankyou for your projection . as for barbie  ask any grown straight man to be honest as to why he liked them and 9 times out of 10  he will say  it was a good way to hang around the girl s  c mon guys admit it  I know its why I did. as to narcissism  I agree it is one of the reasons but there are others  that are just as predominant as well  social conformity  contrarianism and ignorance to name a few. still your point is a valid one.
hello fabulous melonie I always enjoy learning things from these topics.takecare melonie
when I was a kid I watched everything from fresh prince of belair to sabrina the teenage witch  from sister sister to star trek. skin colour never came into things!!2016 is when the cancer that is woke began spreading across the world.
its not just narcissism. its racism. putting people in boxes based on their color is literally marginalizing them. they do it all the time and nobody calls them on it.
when you say   my generation  and mention that youre 35  youre a millennial  like me. we were taught to buck those stereotype true  but its also our generation who is the most vocal about this whole mess  too.millennials are so confused and conflicted. we were taught that everyone is equal and capable and to not see race. but somewhere along the line  college perhaps  most of our contemporaries seem too have forgotten all of that.
one of my favorite characters in star wars is ahsoka  clone wars ahsoka   and she certainly does not look like me  lol. its about good writing. its about honoring the source material and lore. its not about  racial  appeal.
I feel like baby millennials perhaps  but most elder millennials like myself Ive ever talked to agree with me  apart from a karen here and there
yeah you need to be aware  millenials are split into 2 groups. early   pre internet  and late  internet native . so all of the criticisms of millenials  of everyone I know in my age group of a early millenials  dont fit this stereotype and its a very clear divide.
all I can really say is that I agree 100 .
just because kiryu chan might be a virgin doesnt mean that every virgin can dance  sing and fight like a dragon. you cant just see someone boxing and say   thats rad!  and than become a professional boxer just because youre a virgin just like kiryu.
this works for gaming too. cant tell you how many times Ive received insults for trying out a female character  in mass effect for instance . why do I need to see myself on screen  I play games and watch films to escape  myself  and my reality.
it use to be that the shows checked off the race list like captain planet or power rangers.  now there is a whole new list they have to check off.  it just keeps going and going.  all these people that keep going   I need someone that looks like me!  there aren t enough that look like me!   Im like melonie with most of the heroes characters I pretended to be wanted to be like were many times anime or fantasy characters.  I swear some of these people thatsay they are repressed or need to have characters of these race  if they have kids  then the last thing they tell their kids before leaving the house is   remember kids.  everyone else has more privilege then you!  everyone is out to get you and hold you back!   stop with this b.s. complaining and making it that because you possibly live in a shit neighborhood that the rest of the us is out to get you.  most of the people in the us dont care who you are and dont have enough time to  hold you back .  they have their own issue to deal with.  anyone ever notice you can never find a map showing the areas where this supposed violence  all over the us  is.  I bet if you could put dots in all the areas where some of this supposed hatred is  then you would most likely see many of the dots in the same place.  but no  the media would rather just stick with what you see all the time and say that its all over.  what a joke!also  people need to stop crying racial appropriation just because someone that isn t from a particular race maybe wears something they think looks nice or if they live in that region  then they may be trying to fit in with the people around them.  again  not everyone is out to get you  so quit being butt hurt about everything you see.  there is a difference between enjoying another culture and making fun of something or trying to stereotype something.
that enterprise meme was kinda funny tho
the closest character to me is the mutant guy in 300  and I still enjoy all kinds of entertainment media.
representation is a revival of  ism s . Imissed this indoctrination  otherwise I would have passed on ripley  sarah connor and 500 hours playing kassandra. what a shame that would have been.
my grandpa bought me a ken doll  it was because all my action figures were too short to play barbies with the girl I had a crush on
my favorite is that I cant possibly know what its like to be latino in the us despite being a man born and raised in puerto rico. my accent is as heavy as the sofrito in my rice and beans but I have white skin so it doesnt count
agreed rings of power is the definition of narcissism
half of the dudes I know construct  paint  and admire dolls to this day. amazing how none of them have ever considered swapping genders.
my favorite cartoon growing up was transformers. obviously  that must be because I  too  am a giant transforming robot from cybertron.
you know you ve won when they trot out the  pick me  line because the cant answer back with an actual logical response.
I couldn t identify with the teenage mutant ninja turtles so instead of becoming a crime-fighting ninja I became a normie with a normal job still living in the sewer.
is not just narcissism  they want superficial  representation  based on ethnicity and sxlty because they have nothing else to compare with  they have no personality  no goals  no values  no interests  bothing that can help create a correlation or bond with other characters abd people. their sense of self and values begging and end with their superficial traits.Im latin american and the characters I feel conected to aren t latinos there s solomon kane wich I like because of his intolerance for evil  there s dcau s batman and the shadow because of their take on the detective archetype  daniel jackson form sg1 because of his intelligence and interest in alternative history and comparative mythology  which Im also interested in and odo from deep space nine who literally has the same personality that I have and hes and amorphous shape shifting alien. I look nothing like them and yet I have more in common with that than with a character like  lets say america chaves from dr. strange two. as I said the only people that need someone with the same superficial traits in order to relate to them are people with no personality or personal interests.
ah  such culture  a hisoka fan. 10 10
one of your best videos..
I feel exactly the same .
I wanted to be the first black power ranger zack as a kid  Im a white half cuban lol Ive never felt the need to be represented  in fact  an italian played scarface. most people dont care that he did.
I can be a bit clingy in a relationship  mad laugh follows
thank you

Im surprised no one is complaining about ursula casting. its melissa mccarthy and personally I think it would be perfect role for a drag queen. the character was inspired by divine
some times I relate more to female chars and I am a man lol
bless you thanks for being brave.
since we both like hisoka that must mean we re sociopathic pedophiles
I agree 100 . I think every person with a healthy brain does.
thanks for the content ms. mack!
self-inserts in media by these fringe element wacko writers and showrunners in media today are one of the major things fueling these notions about representation.  when you are creating for your self instead of the general public who wants to be entertained with a good story  a wrong turn has already been taken.it was always good to have at least one barbie doll in the mix for your gI joes to save when they go on a mission.
refreshing to hear the truth
as a very longtime fan of high fantasy fiction and studies both folklore and mythology and  and one happens to be black  its sad people are labeled as being racist simply because they want things represented in their historical and cultural manner.
I haung out with girls in school and guys always tried to say I was gay because I wanted to hangout with girls lol
yay someone else thinks it
anyone else notice that this is mainly focused at girls  they ll claim that a barbie doll will cause  body image  issues in little girls  but Ive never heard of a little boy with  body image  issues because of he-man.
man  even when your hair is all messed you look good melonie xd if I ever make a tomb raider movie Im talking to you about being lara
oh  but dont you know  people cant be individuals anymore. you cant have your own opinions. people need to be represented  because it represents their community. and community is the golden egg that keeps us all... something or other...
haha your barbie comment hit home. I would play he-man action figures but put them in the barbie pink corvette!
what Imost dislike about this representation thing in media is depending of the show or movie its very immersion breaking.  if Im watching a show thats set in medieval europe or a fantasy stand in for europe I expect the people to look european unless there s a backstory of how they got there.  same if Im watching something that takes place in samuraI japan  I expect the people to look japanese.  having a multi-ethnic cast in these two scenarios just looks odd and breaks the fantasy.
representation does matter in my opinion in terms of how the represented are portrayed but not in terms of relating to the characters imo. for example  when someone mentions middle eastern  it makes most americans think of  terrorists   suicide bombers  being muslim  third world desert environments  etc. the way the media portrays certain demographics creates stereotypes. Im a black guy and some people will assume Im in a gang and dont know who my father is.
what annoys me is everyone is getting represented except me. where are all the super tough  handsome yorkshire men with fake tattoos I draw on every single day  where are all the below average intelligence highschool drop outs who chase random people around with dog turds on sticks  hollywood needs to do so better!
I dont need my own background to like a character. I like noble 6  master chief  johnny gat  revy  saeko busujima  and juliet starling because they re all badasses for instance.
holy crap youre 35  I thought you were like 25 at most. good on you.
oh they are
that is so epic
melonie sure make it hard not to simp   on an earlier vid I heard her say she a big Godzilla fan and thats pretty huge
the batman had  representation  and both actors killed it in their roles so no one gave a shit. now obviously they were side characters which makes sense. the batman is white and changing that is absurd. btw what did you think of the batman melonie  I loved it  cant wait for the sequel.
you hit the nail on the head when you mention segregation....thats the whole point of this whole agenda.
according to this stupid  you can only relate to characters that look like you  argument only trees should be able to relate to ents in Lord of the rings but I dont think trees were part of the target audience for peter jacksons lotr movies.
that makes a lot of sense actually
I grew up watching family matters  steve urkel didn t have to be white for me to relate with. he was a nerdy character who was goofy and makes mistakes just like I did as a kid. if he was a neighbor  I felt we would be easy friends. one of my favorite and most badass comic characters are black  blade and spawn. hell  in spawn  all the mortal souls suffering in the background of the hell-scape scenes looked all the same. shit  none of they disney princes look like me  a fat white dude  I dont see a chubby recasting of prince eric happening anytime soon  but can care less.
hey mel  can you sing    you d make a great mermaid!
oh yeah  that reminds me  when I was looking at the congo action figures  I wanted monroe.
another great video
I cant relate to this character anymore  I got a tan over summer.
my favorite character is the toxic avenger but how could I relate too him  I dont look like him  I didn t jump into a vat of toxic chemical waste that disfigured and mangled my body    weird... I guess we re both male so...
its not that people dont like the casting  its more that they aren t allowed by law nearly..to dislike the casting.
as some people rightfully say    the more one tries to prove they are not racist  the more they become so
no its definitely narcissism. that one lady playing the black dwarf is super full of herself. there are countless interviews where the reporters asking how does it feel to be the first black female dwarf in Lord of the rings. the amount of pride in her face is almost indescribable and disgusting.I remember watching an interview of benjamin sisko who played in star trek  I think that who it was  im not a trekky lol . somebody asked him how did it feel to be the first black captain  he said  let me stop you right there. Im an actor period who read a script that just said it was looking for a captain so I played a captain. my skin color had absolutely nothing to do with it paraphrasing but I absolutely respect that more than the first black female dwarf that doesnt have a beard lolalso growing up some of my favorite characters growing up were dinobot from beastwars  jackie chan  static shock  spiderman and wes the red time force ranger. none of them even look like me yet I love them as a kid cuz they were awesome
this girl is awesome
you are a very genuine person  and your hearts in a good place the way you speak about these topics  detached from the poison or one side of the other is the way you should be approached  but most people are not ready for that
you can only group people into ideological form  through force to ensure the strongest form of oppression.
hmm  notice that there s no red-haired lady in that picture in that tweet..  I am not sure if this is a myth but  according to my mum  who had an interest in ancient history  but she may have been mistaken  apparently  red hair originally came from the vikings.
I get that those actresses were excited to get a role in a Lord of the rings series  but their characters and roles are so forgettable. no one is gonna remember those in ten years  no one is gonna associate them with those charcters  cate blanchet will be remembered as the only movie galadriel no doubt   no one will feel inspired by them.
35 years old !  I thought she was like 21-23 woah
I looooved the batman! my second fav batman film ever  it was great
good old melvin the mop boy
true. a character s lasting power falls on both writing and performance  if either of those are bad they ll be unforgettable. unless youre anakin lol
my friends who this is supposed to pander too  hate it with a passion. they feel  along with me  that it tells them that they cant create anything new for them. that they have to go here you go x race  we changed a white character to be just like you. there are awesome black  asian  hispanic  etc. characters out there that get no attention because these self hating and pandering people want to focus on the white characters. use existing characters of that race or make new ones that are compelling. according to them  I shouldnt ever like one of my favorite comic characters because he doesnt look like me. heck I could never dress up as him because I would be accused of white washing. I remember reading luke cage back in the day and liking him as he had traits I didnt at the time and inspired me.  despite studies showing that people just like characters that are good. example being video games  the vast majority dont care about the race or gender of the characters.agree about the playing with barbies and stuff. I played with my little sister  because she was my sister. same way that two guys cant be close friends without them being labeled gay now. these people seem to be hellbent on destroying society. its pretty demonic
Im 44 and these days I dont get the  representation  garbage. if youre going up wanting fake make believe characters with your skin color  imo  something is wrong with that person. all the movies and shows Ive grown to love  I liked because of the story and character. never once thought I wish robocop was black. just enjoyed the damn movie. never once thought I wish the cast of family ties was black. just enjoyed the show. thats how it was growing up. you see something you like  you watched and hoped it was good. I guess Im the asshole for not wanting more black characters  eh  this society has become so petty these past 10 years. sad to see. I think humanity peaked late 90s-early  00s. been on a steady devolution since with the dumb shit being argued these days.
5 42 huge point!
I ll be honest  I ll be completely honest  if changing the skin color for ariel had to be a thing  they should have found an islander type girl  and put on red hair. just my take. otherwise yes this is a sense of ego feeding narcissism.
one of my favorite horror movie characters is jason voorhees. I dont identify with him at all and nobody should.
when I was growing up I loved ariel and I dont look anything like her. I honestly dont think most kids think like that. its the adults that are putting that on them. light-skinned girls should be allowed to love moana and mulan  and black girls should be allowed to like elsa and original ariel. boys should be allowed to like the princesses and girls should be allowed to like woody from toy story. I have never understood people s obsession with keeping others in a  box  that they canthen categorize them in. like  yeah  we should have visible diversity but then make new stuff. if you want kids to know representation  let them watch coco  luca and encanto--all beautiful and original films  not refurbished versions of already existing ones.
youre such a rad chick!
lol been waiting for you to comment on this one!
pretty much. when I was growing up  nobody was asking children how they felt about characters  looking  like anybody.now  parents prime their kids and then film them reacting to the little mermaid trailer and they say  she looks like me   which is irrelevant. kids loved the lion king  no humans are represented there.for rings of power  that lineup would be incredibly disheartening I think  if little girls are supposed to look up to them. bronwyn is...I dont know  lucky  shes kind of an idiot and she is the only person in her entire area wearing blue. but she does things she should not be able to as a regular herbwoman.the harfoots  their entire story is a waste of time  7 episodes in  cut them out  lose nothing.queeny. is an idiot and not a good queen  galadriel makes her look weak and foolish with constant pissing matches.isildur s sister dont know her name . her whole story is becomes an architect  doesnt like war  manipulates a dude into terrorism  what a role model.nugaladriel is just...the worst. shes an evil  narcissistic bitch who in the time we see her  tries to abandon her own people and later slags them off for only following her for 300 years when she wont even command them in a fight  leaps into the ocean which would have been suicide  yells at the numenorians  a lot  threatens the numenorians multiple times  still somehow manages to get her way despite breaking laws and the like over and over again and she threatens torture and genocide to her enemies if they are snarky to her. galadriel is evil.disa was fine  mother  leader  magic singer  overall  okay  but apparently shes super mega ambitious and tells her husband to ignore his father and his king s  words which gets his disinherited. unclear why thatshift happened.original lotr also had the real galadriel  who  was powerful as fuck and pretty damn awesome  even though we dont see much of her. she is a strong female  but shes a lot more like the ideal that little girls tend to want  shes pretty  has nice clothes  and has magic. thats the princess thing but on steroids.
but mel  didnt youread yhat news article   if we dony see the rings of powah  it may end in an economic depresion
as a girl I think having all of these tv shows having female leads is awesome. not because we need female leads but new stories and characters should be fun. unfortunately they have done such a bad job representing good female leads. they are super unlikable and uninteresting. it is such a waiste to an opportunity to bring new stories and fun characters.
heavy metal is the law!
this is activism getting completely out of hand.
on paper Im actually fine with a lot of  progressive  ideas but the problem is execution and at the root of that is motive. for representation in particular the ideal motivation would be about making space for more diverse media. this doesnt require a destruction of legacy media or has to be done at the expense of good story and characters and entertainment and even morals but reality is that the movement along with most other progressive ones are revenge based and divisive. its unfortunate because their is merit to improving or rather building on previous diverse works and expanding them. no one needs characters to look like them to enjoy them but that doesnt mean it isn t nice to have such things. representation and diversity in media isn t bad in and of itself but its current objectives  motivation and execution is.
the very idea that the people need to have any moral obligation to support this bs just show how ridiculously bad is their product..
woooooo fellow yuno fans stand up!!!
its not something you would wanna wish on a person. unless you want lefty street cred and are a-ok with treating your child as an accessory the way an heiress might treat a tiny dog.
honestly though. all bs aside. if you showed me all the the pictures amazon keeps putting out about rings of power and I didn t know they had done a Lord of the rings show. I dont know what I would think.
anyone remember wall-e  sentient trash compactor. he didn t  respresent  me or anyone else  but people could sympathize with him. a lot of people who have largely left western entertainment behind have started watching anime  and only a few percent of us look like those characters.
why do you have to feel like youre represented by characters in movies   I thought that the whole idea of movies is escapism
wow I thought was the only one who felt like the whole  representation matters  argument was low-key narcissistic and self indulgent. like why do you need characters to look like you to connect with them  I  m a black guy and to this day the character Ive always found the most relatable is a chinese woman.  mulan  like race and gender is not everything.
my daughter loves groot  and surprisingly  she s not a talking tree. my gf s favorite superhero is wolverine  and fortunately for me  she s not a short hairy dude. my favorite sw character is ahsoka tano. point is  there s no world in which this take wrong. my 5 year old daughter loves lol dolls and she knows no difference between the black ones and white ones. she loves them all. I dont teach any of that crap. not in my house.
hisoka. love that bungee gum.
while I understand that representation of your sex or race or whatever can give you a certain link to a fictional character  they have to be of high quality already. I love joshua graham from fallout new vegas because of his story and personality  and the fact he s a Christian does make me appreciate him more  but if he was badly written then it wouldn t matter. if it did  I d like  God s not dead  despite that being a really cringe movie. if these people cared about representation  they d give people well-written characters who they can genuinely appreciate rather than just showing them a characters thats the same phenotype or sexuality as them and expecting gratitude for the barest minimum.
Im half mexican and I dont look like luke skywalker at all! however he is my favorite character of all time.
I can watch movies and identify with people who are a different race or gender than myself. I think the little mermaid is getting so much heat because everyone is just sick of the cultural marxism. the little mermaid trailer is getting trolled hard on youtube. its hilarious.
why did you stop doing the verse of the day  Imiss those
Im not a tall  rich  white  orphan genius  so I guess I shouldn t be as big of a fan of batman as I am.
my all-time favourite movie is the lion king  and I love all the characters in the movie. but its not because they look like me. I am a human being  these characters are wild african animals.
its narcissism. Im a latin american guy and almost never felt the need to be represented in most media. shit  in the mcu  the most representation I got was from captain america because he s the son of 2 immigrants. and the most represented Ive felt from a movie in years was oj in nope because he s a quiet introvert that likes animals. thats it  and I never felt the need for more representation. representation is neat to have  not required. ideally we should be having characters that we aspire to be and can empathize with. not wishing that its you being the focus of the story.
is it just me or a lot of the followers this girl has is because she s objectively attractive
weeb!   . you are completely based. keep pushing back.
I liked optimus prime when I was a kid. the fact that he didn t represent my race never mattered. it only matters to antI racists who more often than not are the real racists.
your hair looks good like that!
its especially creepy when they talk about racial  representation  by saying  kids need to see superheroes  etc. that look like them .  isn t it considered racist to think all black people  brown people  etc. look alike
in my opinion the only show that did inclusive representation correct is dan harmon s community
stop playing their game. its all being done to disrupt and demoralize you.
they dont want representation. they want to complain about being a victim so people pay attention to them for once in their lives because they re trapping themselves in a room 24 7 with only the internet for friends. even if a movie had every combo of person possible in it they will still complain. its sad and pathetic.
the girl that plays her isn t even 14
fyI  this comment is kinda long winded and wordy.     anywho  hey mel  its jen..yup  100   I fully agree  that  representation activism  is narcissism .  though   in the entertainment industry activism is basically like a vampire needing blood to live.however  in the entertainment world in regards to representations  I think hollywood  entertainment is starting to notice that we aren t happy about their version of  representation   from that of gender swapping to race-swapping or as I call it   meat swapping  of  characters and stories.what I have noticed  is lately that the entertainment industry is starting to change the use of their semantics. the representation  is ironically being swapped out for the shiny new word reimagination. so  now when you hear someone in the entertainment industry  or basically anywhere say  e.g.   we are reimagining _____ novel.  - just think representation  or  we are reimagining _____ character  think representation. in conclusion  when you hear   representation   think  reimaginationl    or reversely  when you hear   reimaginationl   think  representation. laters mel and everyone!!! have a great rest of your friday and j weekend.buh-bye  jen
thank you!  d
@melonie mac go boom  of course  3
ive always wanted an 18 wheeler because of him
when you were a kid  I still love optimus prime. guy is the paragon of leadership and nobility  love him. he s a total badass.
well they could see that if hollywood actually did their research
thesis  antithesis  synthesis.
btw. I dont remember many women who grew up watching Lord of the rings in general  let alone arwen. how many girls does amazong reckon will acutally grow up watching the shitshow that is ring of powers  like  how many girls will watch it to begin with  according to the view numbers  very very few.
absolutely spot on  melonie.representation is narcissism. everything these days has to be all about skin colour or gender and even sexuality. never mind traits like one s heart or character or other traits like personal courage  honour  responsibility and the like.
people need to go outside more
woke people forget that you dont relate to the characters because you looked like them  yourelate to the characters because of their struggles and their personality that you feel attracted to or you gravitated to.
my favorite disney character is flounder but I am a fish so that is to be expected.
Ive been a massive james bond fan all my life and Ive never wanted nor needed to identify with him. same with every other white characters I never felt like I identified with them. also means as a white person according to them I cant like something like blade
one of my favorite marvel characters as a kid was war machine  and I would have been pissed if he was white in the movies. I also liked peter parker. I liked a lot of the morals he represented  but I never felt represented by peter parker.Ive played tons of video games as a character that covered a vast variety of races with no issue.Jesus  my savior  no doubtedly looked middle eastern  and im not bothered by that at all. people just want accurate movie castings. if they cant get that much right  then why should I give them my time and attention  its really thatsimple.
I like characters if they are interesting. I loved weasley snipes as  blade and most of the  best characters in the wire are black. Im  not black or from the states. its like they are saying I cant like them because Im not black  a woman or asian etc. so stupid.
anytime a black person refers to a black lead or black cast and says  this is our story   I shoot back with  so by that definition a star is born is somehow my story  by that definition Im as good looking as bradley cooper and lady gaga is my woman. when you frame it that way  you see how stupid  identity   representation   a story for my tribe  really is.
soon they wont make any more movies with minions  because they dont represent anyone.and they will also train a mouse to act in the mikey mouse movies shorts.
all my favorite characters from my childhood were males    no particular expalation why. but I absolutely didn t have any urge to be  physically  represented in any movie nI order to relate to the character. if I d relied on repsesentation of my eastern european ethnicity in american movies  I would have grown up as an ugly rude terrorist aparently.
Imean I play games like kirby an I am not a person who just eats everything. I play xeno blade and I pretty sure I did not fight God today. I play ac and I am damn sure not a millionaire in real life. I watch overLord pretty sure I am not a God tier anime character with overwhelming strength  I watch that revenge anime and it did not go far enough to me but I do have a dark side  I also watch romcoms which I lack in my life but they are chill something mindless to make me laugh. I am a 3d artist and Imake mostly female characters... pretty sure I do not see myself as a woman... one of them does resemble an ex of mine entirely by accident guess she was on my mind while making it. I am not this nor do I see myself in this  nor did I put much emotion in it because I am emotionally broken. art aka the below and the above is about freedom and escaping reality  now sjws are strangling the ever loving shit out of it.      https   mundi_umdali.artstation.com projects w6wneg
bloody hell
as a straight guy  I grew up loving a lot of the old disney princess movies  mostly mulan omg mulan is the goat and I related to her so much because I felt like I had very similiar traits and struggles. only thing I knew we didn t have in common was gender obviously  and I never felt any less of a man lol I just see a character and like them for who they are. tbh I even viewed mulan as the type of woman I want to marry with the same values and traits to me growing up she was something what I saw a woman should aim to be.
facts
unfortunately  american culture encourages narcissism. which is why our culture is so insanely myopic right now.
its about racism and narcissism. teaching kids that they can only enjoy a show movie video game comic book etc if there are ppl with their gender  hair color  body proportions  weight class  sexuality and race  is also racist  is narcissistic. character traits are what is most important for a character. its too bad that ppl have their characters have traits or a backstory first for their first step  and then the other for the second step  and then add the characters to their stories for their third step before they even actually make the character  which is supposed to be the first step . the proper way to do things is to first make the characters  second to give them character traits  third to give them a backstory  this step is not always needed because not all characters need a backstory  and then fourth to add them to the story.
as a native american I do not care about representation in fact what Ive noticed is the only people who do care are so insecure its pathetic.
I remember playing with my sister s  life sized  barbie. it was as tall as I was when I was a child. the things I did to that doll.... barbie taught me so much.
youre 35   wow  good dna.
you see it in comics now it is though how they turn around and they say all of a sudden why cant there be an obese superhero why cant they be just an average joe and jane that looks kind of ugly but could be a superhero. it totally lost the concept of the superhero which is supposed  to be a pinnacle of what people want to aspire to and they ve decided instead to drag them down and make them just average people.Im 37 when I was a kid I wanted to be darth vader spiderman and optimus prime lol I unfortunately do not look like any of those people but thats fine with me I wanted to be the character not their skin tone or model number  with optimus prime   lol but my sister who s 32 is on the representation train even though she dressed up as every disney princess when she was younger if you asked her today she said well Im glad their are other dark skinned princesses because when I was younger the only one I could feel represented me was jasmine didn t stop you from dressing up like all the others and wish you could be the others I dont know I see the whole representation thing as a poison in society and it just leads us to regular every day people in shows and movies and nobody wants to see them they re taking the super out of superhero and then they pat themselves on the back and call them niche and out of the box ideas when really its just trash
9 36 in addition to spectrums  dont forget that what is considered one race today wasn t always so. jews and italians have only recently been considered to be white. if youre a light skinned black in south africa  youre not black  whereas in the states  even the slightest bit of african in you and you are black everything else be damned. so the where and when you live is also a big component of what race you are.
the whole thing is  look at me! look at me!  narcissists become annoying after a while.
I agree mel  these people just dont understand... its not about the skin color or race  its about how the character acts and the character s personality.
omg! youre 35!  wow! im 37 and ive always thought u were like 10-15 years younger than me.
narcissistic   maybe.  superficial and racist  definitely.  by pushing  representation  one makes physical characteristics primary  and the person s character non important.  by pushing only identifying with those physical characteristics  it by definition divides us. it is giant steps backward for us as a culture.
nothing needs to be diverse  especially when it comes to fantasy where the rules can be anything. demanding diversity in fantasy means demanding fantasy to be rooted to our world  and that defeats the idea of fantasy being anything the creator wants. make it all black  all white  a mix of everything  whatever. these people should just stop whining thatsomeone else s art isn t catering to their neuroses.all of this is absolutely rooted in narcissism. I dont need a character to look like me to have a connection to them  and people should get therapy if they do. look at ms. marvel being sana amanat and the entire marketing push for the eternals was about  saving lives  through representation. it also seems vindictive and malicious  taking characters created to be one way and changing them  and acting like its such a triumph. as if changing a character s skin color isn t a hollow attempt to retain the character s popularity while trying to reel in shallow racists who wouldn t care about the character otherwise.though  the biggest issue isn t group y being on screen or whether this push for diversity is based narcissism or not  its that the idea of diversity is overtaking overall quality and storytelling as the number one concern of studios.I do not care why people are forcing diversity  and Im fine with it being organic and not blatantly shoved into everything  especially when itseems to be systematically erasing gingers   but Im ready for this trend to stop.
anyone else notice how nike has ads saying both you need representation and people like serena williams so young black girls know they can play tennis and they also have ads saying dont listen to that. be the first you. talk about playing both sides of a coin
nah  let s have more representation. listen up  disney. we will need a hispanic the little mermaid after this. and then we need an east asian the little mermaid  followed by a south asian the little mermaid. and no cgi-ing the live action actress and change their look. you must do the whole production over again for each race.and after 5 years  you need to make one for the transgender the little mermaid. gotta be inclusive. and dont forget the different race for the transgender as well  okay  mouse
Im 38 but my favorite where donald duck  spiderman  wolverine and batman none looked like a blond guy with a ginger beard
you dont understand  how can I enjoy anything if a main character is not a 6 1 250lb anxiety ridden straight white male  I cant simply identify with a characters struggles or personality  and they cant stick to source material thats bigoted. I cant think blade or spawns ba and wish I was as cool as them  or see characters with different sexualities from mine I root for  or see women that I still identify with no problem  s imo they should stick to the source because it will never be enough. if one character is a different race  its a token  if any white characters are in a heroic role  its   white saviors   so they really need to not care at all what anyone says. if she was the best actress available  great  but they dont choose actors resses on merit that often anymore  so you ll get someone inexperienced that damages the film and also will get bullied  because some people are awful and some people dont like paying money for a bad product that also tells them they re not good enough people.
also as far as this video goes. I dont think relating yourself to a character or finding similarities is narcissism. people use the word narcissist like they use the word gluten. they dont know what it is  but dont want any part of it  I find  certain similarities between people and the characters they watch  as a generally good thing.
love the hair
jujutsu kaisen  is
I am so sick of this generation of people
could not finish episode 4 of rop
they have to insert poc and women  for example this is an oscars requirement  and are looking to justify it.  thats where this stupid idea of    representation  came from.
I really thought you had some hispanic in you. native is kinda close though
I loves the little mermaid when I was a kid and im not female my favourite disney character is alladin and im not middle eastern.my favourite actor and movie this year was tom cruise and top gun and I dont know how to fly a jet. and still I related to all of them both growing up and today. this representaion bullshit is so false and everybody knows it otherwise they would have no opinion on movies or gaming overall because they would have not connected with it in the first place. people connect to characters on a depper level then skintone
how many days till halloween again.
what do they always tell us    its not for you   stereotype !    yeah  its time to turn that back around on them.  stop bending over backwards for jackasses.  I liked blade and he didn t represent me.  but I liked it anyway.  you dont have to be represented to like something.
10 02 I love being told Im not hispanic by anglo-american liberals who see my sicilian side  read  not the same thing as italian  as being too white.
I think disney sucks for rehashing stuff they have already done. aladdin is my favorite movie ever as a kid but after watching that live action remake it was horrible!! they just need to make new stories new characters they can make them whatever race they want as long as its new im tired of remakes.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that you are so absolutely right bout that melonie. anyway narcissism and racism is wrong and I think that people who does thatshould be punished for doing that  ok melonie. anyway also the old classic tv shows and old classic anime cartoon shows that are great shows to watch bc it brings back some memories from the days that you were young and growing up up to now adulthood and we need to be happy now with and not judge on what shows that we watch and what they look like on television shows and on movies  ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment on this and I just want to tell you that you are so definitely right bout this message and video that you have done for today  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and I just want to tell you that to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night melonie.
I liked  my easy bake oven.
I appreciate all perspectives but this take is poor. the reason for these swaps is simply because of underepresntion in general. no one says you cant relate to any character its just that for  seemingly obvious reasons hollywood is trying to move forward. you dont have to like it but let s not act like this is something more than what it actually is.
wow  you are 87 like me too thats explains a lot.
itstarted on twitter lol  everyone on that platform is pushing socially politcal views that are socially acceptable non stop to get brownie points. im all being for a decent human being but there comes to a point where people act like their shit dont stink it gets ridiculous
how many people try to identify with a first century carpenter from the middle east
did you upgrade your light   -
they cant use the incel disregard on women so the pick me is the best they can come up with.
narcissism is to ordinary folk what a severe case of leprosy is to an indigenous population.
they crazy
if everyone lived underwater  they d be as white as a beluga whale.
I despise when people say now my kids have someone to look up to when it comes to entertainment.  like you as the parent should be doing everything you canto be a role model not the damn screen youre using to distract the kids so you can get go to the freezer and pour your 5th vodka shot.
little girls will see themselves  is a crock of shit. the only girl who benefits is the actress  once childhood ends they wont care about you  they only care about the money your parent s will spend on their movies and product s. its all shallow. they give zero shits about ordinary people and their struggles  whatever race.
I appreciate like to annie my favorite shows hunter x hunter narto  my hero academia and carole and today cowboy-bebop on netflix vontron I do agree with you I think you should be fall in love with them
savages!!!!!!
its not actually about that. I am telling you what s happening- they need black charcters to be white charcter s part because majority of people in us dont watch black folks  movie. thats the issue here according to them. I think  part of the problem on their part is unwilling to accept that white people are majority in usa. so black people s movies wont be that popular  it actually make sense specially if it is from black people s point of view. what s a popular movie decide by that country s majority. part of the problem in usa that majority doesnt matter  multiculturalism hoorah is the main narrative which is opposite of the reality  so they dont want to accept the reality. even if multiculturalism is your political catch phrase  it wont change the reality in ground level. this is the issue that they re unwilling to look at. multiculturalism is a huge thing in usa only. other than usa  in uk and some other european countries  it is a reality of their political catch phrase but european countries are small hence political catch phrase doesnt matter much. so moot point is that multiculturalism is only possible in usa when no group of people is majority in usa. but thats not the case hence all these are just fantasy. this is why so much effort to put race swipe a white charcter thats very popular among white people.
just ignore that  pick me  crap. they will say that any time a woman has a common sense opinion that doesnt follow their narrative. these people just parrot what they hear.
same light  some days it just looks better than others for some reason lol!
@melonie mac go boom  huh. I guess that depends on the light outside then. if you upgrade or add to your setup I think a  colder  light might be awesome since you have so much reddish hues reflected from your room  -
side note  my wife would also agree with you and is about your age  born in 88 .
choctaw here!
what kids would ever watch rings of power  Imean is that what the demographic they were shooting for because that would explain alot and how bad the show is. because no adult in their right mind would watch that. 2ndly kids will never know this show... they know cartoons and playing withbtheir friends  not some drama filled show with bad acting
most normal people like other cultures an fantasy an true historic stories.. when we see this bs inclusivnes it ruins the story.
my favorite movie heroine is and will always be ellen ripley  she s a white lady  Im a dark skinned asian  guess what I dont care
in a nutshell  https   youtu.be j800sveis5i
damn! youre so cute.
I pity people who can only like people who look   act the same as them. that is not what diversity means. characters are race swapped  gender swapped  etc.  bc the writers have no talent or imagination to invent new characters. one common theme is the  strong women  we often see now are frequently assholes  like the men they hate.
very cringeI couldn t imagine being one of those dumb kids that can only relate to characters if they looked like me. I wouldn t pander to people like that  it makes them think its ok that they cant connect outside of superficial traits. I dont care about  representation  so long as they aren t race swapping characters but if your characters only selling point is skin color or the vernacular they use then you have a weak character
no disrespect but as an asian male I find western twitter very weird
little mermaid remake looks bad  but not because of the raceswap.yes that is kinda woke to just do it for that reason but if she can act then ok finebut the remake looks soulless.its just disney banking on nostalgia like with cinderella beauty and the beast  aladdin lion king and now little mermaid
no one will remember rings of blunder in 5 years... its not produced to be memorable like the classics  because millenial minds lives in a constant state of bombardment by the midia and internet. everything needs to be  skin deep   literally  and chek de left boxes to made quick money. no girl will remember these characters when they grow up  only  the message .
just more forced girl power to me. I want my feminine heroes back. like nike from the world is still beautiful and other anime I love.
35  wow  youre a full fox
lol! part native  you should call yourself something like  injun mel  just to piss off the wokey-doodle-doos!
wokism is prejudice   guilt.
so I guess this also applies to people who oppose diversity because they dont want people who dont look like them in their entertainment.
I dont have leg in this... I will saywhat s wrong with ppl liking to see themselves in mediablanketing ppl by your preference is disingenuous... speak your truth nonetheless
racial purity was alien to native americans  this is why they re so mixed these days. they married or had sexual relations  forced or willing  with trappers  raiding tribes like the comanche kidnapped white and latino women and children  seminoles in florida mingled and intermarried with escaped blacks  the cherokee kept slaves themselves  etc. one of the last apache raiding parties was lead by a blonde white man identified as charley mccomas  who was kidnapped by chato s warband when he was 6. we re talking 1920s here.
uuhm no. the pathetic truth is that no one is growing up remembering  these women . in fact in about 6 months  nobody will even know this show ever existed.
I identify as neanderthal because so many sapiens are foolish.
its ok  most of us americans find western twitter really weird too
wokies have zero concept of actual native culture
@melonie mac go boom  hell yeah  sister! it tends to be a combination of noble savage and helpless victim. Im hungarian  my people rode and raided all the way to italy and spain in the 9-10th century and I find the denial of the natives  bravery and ferociousness and skill in battle insulting.
isn t the idea that we can only relate to people that look like us  a fundamentally racist idea
what s worse melonie final fantasy 13 or phase 4 of marvel and thoughts on final fantasy 12
social justice racists cantry to push this representation argument but its hopeless  no force in the universe can separate black nerds from their love of dragonball lol
saying the actress isn t black enough is racist  there s lots of racism in black communities against people who are mixed and seen as less than. its a discussion the grifters continue to ignore for convenience.
its just more blackwashing of red headed white female characters. there is a rather extensive list anniearielhawkgirlmary janestarfiretriss merigoldand thats just the tip of the spear. they blackwashed joan of ark and king arthur too.
marone!!!!!!
wait tom boy   transgender  o boy my happly married sister need to know she is trans.
whats this accent  connecticut  fargo
calling someone a  pick me  is just another lame attempt at silencing a factual statement. its another way of saying you have  internalized misogyny  just to disregard your point of view.
I really hope no little girls are looking up to those characters.  they re all God-awful  with the exception of maybe disa....
Godzilla
fortnite is great  1
wokeness  is 100  a   - mental  disease _   I am sick of crap  like this its even on quantum leap  when dos it end . I feel that   poor writing and  the crazy  people making woke content should all be removed from earth . entirely
laborious and tedious.
man I d like to see her talk about something thatshe likes. its just all negative.
lets be honest  if a boy play with a barbie doll  its abitsuspect
although I think the little mermaid remake race swapping ariel is representation activism and it is narcissism  I think the racist response from fans simply because the actress is black is messed up. ppl are calling her a  burnt fish  and a  ghetto princess . I get that ppl dont like that disney is trying to be woke  but that doesnt mean you can let out your inner klan member
rings of power is woke  hot garbage. I hate jeff bezos so im not crying because he hire absolutely inept script-writers. its such an awful show with the world record holder of the most unlikeable character ever.
black panther wasn t very representative of whites. 99  black cast... most diverse movie ever made. tells you all you need to know about what diversity really means. nowhiteguilt  dayoftherope  wewilltakeourcountriesback
have you ever thought that maybe you never felt represented by white characters because you dont live in a nation where you never see someone that looks like you   therefore it was never a problem for you. especially in such a racist world and nation like the us  which is where most of cinema comes from
I could never get through the boredom that was ffxiiI  but even so  almost nothing is as bad as phase 4 marvel lol! ffxiI was great
@melonie mac go boom  ffxiI was great! probably my favorite old-school ff title.
@melonie mac go boom  lmao. as much as I loathe 13  I would take it over phase 4 anyday.
@melonie mac go boom 13 characters were pretty insufferable
12 was great
I love 12 a lot
I grew up all over  my accent is a mix of places Ive lived lol. not connecticut tho
Imean  I have a 13 year old channel for that  meloniemac. youre commenting on my brand new channel that centers around controversial topics  if thats not your cup of tea you should be on my other channel lol
why  its just different of what you are used to see.
totally normal  just like it was normal for me to like sports and gI joe
@adam  its messed up
its nonsense. this  representation  is a buncha bs. representation in government  good. but representation in all other aspects  aheh! look  if you need to be represented  in all things  by somebody else  then you are not enough of an actual  person to represent yourself. short version.
its crazy no white people had this opinion when they were playing ancient egyptians in hollywood film for the last 100 years. but what do I know.
if you have been representing in entertainment in a positive way for decades and have taken away opportunities like that from other communities for decades then maybe you shouldn t be talkin because youre just setting up a double standard
youre not fooling anyone there melonie. youre about this now  but in your prime I doubt you were the church going type.
disney  has 70 years of mostly white princesses  nobody bats an eyelittle mermaid is black now  representation is narcissism
daily reminder that Jesus does not exist.
Ive been a Christian almost my entire life  just a couple years I went through a rebellious stage.also Im in my prime now
