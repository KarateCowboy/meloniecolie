I literally laughed out loud when gandalf said his  Im good  line. I had always imagined  annatar sauron teaching celebrimbor some arcane magics to be used on the rings  but what we got is halbrand suggesting the most basic metallurgic principles. also  why did they need a giant forge tower  they melted the silver and gold dagger in a regular forge and then just dropped the mithril into the mix.
crappy tv shows retold by melonie  needs to be a weekly installment
at this point Im rooting for sauron.
what a deep and profound finding nemo quote
the best part of rings of power finale was when the penguin king asked guyladriel  do you yeild   to which guyladriel replied  I do not.  literally chills down my spine.
gandalf   im not sauron  Im good. the most emotional and moving line in a tolkien production.  bravo.
it hits one of the harfoots which is good  says everything about this show..
melonie popping in and out is funnier than anything in the show
I loved that part when galadriel electrocuted sauron while screaming  unlimited power!!!! . it gave me the runs!
the terrible irony is that all the changes to galadriel have not only turned her into a selfish  sociopathic meathead  but nearly everything bad that happened in the show is a direct result of her vengeance obsession. they have turned a wise and beloved character into an out-and-out moronic villain
so sauron turns evil again because galadriel rejects him and makes him an incel. great stuff  couldn t have written it better.  - the elves forge their rings first and make them out of mithril and only do it to save their own dying light. fabulous  love it. - sauron canteleport now and has access to sorcery and matrix reactions but has never chosen to use them until now. positively shwifty! - galadriel finally figures out who the baddie is. tells no one. learns nothing about her mistakes. shakespeare level writing..   if you take into account the amount of money spent to make this  the source material it comes from etc. then I think its fair to say that this is the worst show ever made.
best part of the finale is melonie reviewing it lmao
then galadriel is like   uh-oh  something doesnt add up yet.   she s got her receipts right there.  hilarious!
I love the recapp. it felt like a 90s skater bro was trying to summarize what each character was saying. the only thing missing was a bill and ted sound byte of  no way!
all those twists and surprises and mysteries... are exactly what literally everyone predicted since episode 1
melonie--your muppet voices and dialogue when recapping is way more entertaining than having to suffer through the actual show!!
shehulk and this together has been so brutal I cant even express the pain lol
melonie  your recap is so funny! its like youre playing with dolls and I can imagine hearing you voice the characters through the dolls with gestures!
all good things must come to an end... melonie  the fandom is nowhere near done with this show  I ll tell you that for nothing.
this episode felt like they ran outta time and were like  oh shit this series is called rings of power we gotta put some rings in it  after they initially planned to have a huge balrog fight for episode 8 which might have actually been cool.
not sure if the name gandalf was granted   to amazon by the tolkien estate
any take on cdpr going esg not gonna support a company thats pushing that  no matter how overrated edge runners is.
she s just jumping on the bandwagon for the incels who cant admit the show was actually okay... and you ll be watching season 2
@nox  hah! lmao evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin good forces have invented or made  j. r. r. tolkien.never watch it but did watch my extended trilogy again just recently.
yes ok is what I want to feel after watching a tv series
Im confused because whole brand sauron bloody loved creating things and he was well evil
melonie retells can be a whole channel. xd
Imust have fallen asleep.  I thought the line was  she does not know our rules.... only death is the test of it.
@vinnynj78  Im not familiar with that quote.  what is that from
@shadowphoenix82  lol the super mario bros trailer dude.  lol
the only thing worse than rings of power is this kind of comment. this shit went stale months ago.
I cant wait for this movie
@shadowphoenix82  adaptation of a line from the end of dune
Im crying
personally I think he is saruman and the horrors the harfoots inflicted on him turned him evil  thats why he went and wrecked the shire later on  as revenge.
@darren chiam  lol I like that     that would explain his disdain for the hobbits in the lotr trilogy.
@d flatt  saruman doesnt hate hobbits  he hates gandalf and him harming the hobbits is just a means for him to hurt gandalf.
@kurosh moshfegh  I dont disagree.  he does say things like this though  your love of the halfling s leaf has clearly slowed your mind. this comment means that gandalf has been dumbed down by hanging out with those idiot hobbits.  there are more quotes like that throughout the movie books.  please dont make me come up with more
@d flatt  Imean come up with more  talking about the books movies with strangers is far more enjoyable than watching this God awful show. I couldn t make it past episode two.
@kurosh moshfegh  I agree completely on that one lol.  the rop is terrible.  I wonder why they didn t just grab peter jackson. he also says  you did not think a hobbit could contend with the will of sauron. in the book he glared at frodo with hatred  could have been personal though
@kurosh moshfegh  tbh saruman seems disdainful of everyone.  dont think the hobbits received any  special  hatred from saruman.  saruman is just one of those individuals that hates everyone.
hI good Im dad
I was upset none of the harfoots got flamed
itsounds like its straight from a small children cartoon show or something.
meesa not a sith Lord  meesa good!
im not sauron . Im just drawn that way.
I am not incel. I am senpai.
@kurosh moshfegh  first of saruman never hated anyone. I suggest youread the books and even the movies established clearly he never did his action out of hatered.
@dendrien thestrange  lol no sir  my source is tolkien s thoughts on the subject out of his own mouth. saruman was extremely bitter and jealous of gandalf for having a ring and he thought itshould have been his ring. maybe you should be the one to read the books
@dendrien thestrange  in fact he s been jealous and hated gandalf since his name was curumo because he volunteered as an emissary and manwe commanded gandalf to go. seriously have you actually read the books
this line made me feel like it was written by the same person that wrote  somehow palpatine returned ...
just reaffirms that they have the best writers in the business.  reminds me phantom menace worthy dialog  its working   its working   are you an angel   Im going to stay in this cocktail   melonie makes a great point your going to let your teenage daughter just runoff with some old dude who you dont know.  watch amazon totally go down the rabbit hole and have the old man abuse the shit out of her and sell her to the sex slave trade.  thatsure sounds like empowering young women right there.
nah thats inaccurate. it was when she shot lightning and said  I am all of the sith!
@crimzon nova  wrong it was when she summoned storm breaker and throw it at sauron s chest and then said  sauron  you killed my brother  now you die
thing is in all of tolkien s writings  vengeance leads to death and suffering. turin turambar  fingolfin  thorin  gollum  etc. they all die the worst imaginable deaths because revenge destroys you from the inside out. why is it that every single non-tolkien work of middle earth has the main character do revenge and portray it as justified  the shadow of mordor games portrayed that  and now rings of power. it really feels like all these corpos use middle earth for is as a template fantasy world  ignoring the underlying themes.
@daniel jones  gollum was more possessive of the ring than vengeful. I totally agree otherwise.
@fiction theorizer  Imostly included him because of his downfall after he felt frodo betrayed him. before he almost seemed to be moving on from it because he was conflicted when he saw frodo asleep ad the ring unguarded. once he felt betrayed revenge became an element
@daniel jones  that was more a movie element as I recall. still a fairly accurate list though.
I dont mind her being this way  tolkien used the word amazonian when describing her  go look up the definition on that and get back to me. for tolkien to even reach for that word is saying something  and shes an elf and legit bloodline. I dont have an issue with her being this way in this age really  alot of people do because they seen the movies and havent read a book or claim to have to. and im not even a fan of the show lol  or the direction they overall are taking and the amount of lore there butchering. but galadriel herself  idk I think people are reaching and getting there videos in and views  but if you want the definition of an amazon  here it is.  they were a group of female warriors and hunters  who beat men in physical agility and strength  in archery  riding skills  and the arts of combat. their society was closed for men and they only raised their daughters  either killing their sons or returning them to their fathers  with whom they would only socialize briefly in order to reproduce.  its greek mythology  tolkien borrowed alot from the greeks.... take a look at the backwards leaves they wear... greeks wore them like that... theres a bunch others but there more layered and not as obvious but I can get into it if you want. so im not really mad at them for making her like a tauriel type of fighter  the faults with this show lie with other things and its pacing tbh.
@profo  you would have a point if she weren t completely incompetent in the show
@daniel jones  people act like there tolkien experts  when in reality there not  same with starwars lol I constantly have to correct people on stuff because nobody knows anything from any expanded universe book. but everyone claims to be some big big fan and yeah its all just fake  we have fake nerds nowadays. im not even kidding lol.
@profo  yet they still get more right than the cooperations that push this garbage. not that its really hard to do at this point.
@daniel jones  aside gollum  whose doom was being addicted to the ring  and fingolfin  who should be replaced by his elder half-brother feanor   youre right
@profo  tolkien was more about germanic  norse and celthics with the elves than greeks. numenor though  is mostly inspired by atlantis. you see  the problem isn t that galadriel is a good warrior in the show  but thatshe was depriven of her wisdom and her mystical strenght  which she already had in valinor and cultivated with melian the maia   and also that all the male fighters around her were made incompetent for her to look cool.
@nico krasnow  fingolfin fought a battle he knew he could not win out of vengeance since morgoth destroyed thousands of his kin. faenor is a better example  sure  but fingolfin is still a valid example.
maybe one becomes wise as a result of those things and its quite reasonable to assume that a younger galadriel was motivated and driven this way - one is never just innately wise - life lessons elicit wisdom even to elves surely -  also  not ironic at all  no irony here
@jeff turner  she is literally one of the oldest elves around...like she was one of the noldor that got banished when faenor had everyone kill the sea elves. if other elves have their crap together  why doesnt she by the end of the second age they did galadriel dirty  man
@daniel jones  still able to learn from experiencess  no matter how old  especially if life had been more beer and skittles prior to her bro dying and tolkien tells us thatshe was decieved in his writings
@jeff turner  it was most certainly not beer and skittles. she witnessed the horrors of morgoth and faced banishment by the valar for faenors sins. after all that  there is no way she would be the insecure inexperienced immature person she is in rings of power. the writers simply dont know how to write galadriel.
@jeff turner  dude  she s thousands of years old and was trained by a maia who was feared by morgoth  luthien s mother by the way   and was stated as kind and discerning even when she lived in valinor. these retcon doesnt make sense.
@jeff turner  you d have a point if galadriel was ever actually humbled or suffered consequences for any of her actions. even after sauron s reveal she keeps it a secret instead of taking responsibility for her mistake. this is not character growth  this is someone s wish fulfillment story. and the irony I was referring to was that they wanted to make galadriel an even stronger female character  because in hollywood s opinion only warriors can be strong  than she already was but instead made her a vastly inferior one.
@fiction theorizer  I agree lol  im not behind these people  in any way there ruining this guys work.
@nico krasnow  norse yeah definitly  but he also encorporated smaller other things  but ur definitly not wrong thats definitly true. and yeah im not a fan of what the show is doing  im just trying to understand why amazon wen the direction it did with her  and I think I can see what they thought  but its ofcoarse not how tolkien would of made her  but idk. but  in tolkien s world  as he shows many times that a being of lesser overall strength can overcome a being of greater strength if the being of lesser strength is combat oriented and the being of greater strength is not.an example of this is eonwe  who despite being a maia was considered greater at arms than any of the valar. he was also chosen to be manwe s herald in overthrowing morgoth.another example is tulkas who despite being weaker than the prodigious melkor morgoth was able to make melkor run away in fear due to tulkas  superior fighting capability.
@nico krasnow  I think the norse stuff correlates to the valar  more than the elves particularly but I agree.
but but  slay queen
@profo   from her earliest years  she had a marvelous gift of insight into the minds of others  but judged them with mercy and understanding  and she withheld her goodwill from none  save only feanor.   - j.r.r. tolkienthis description of the true galadriel makes amazon s pathetic version even more laughable!
@sean russell  tolkien didnt just have one depiction of her though  but I hear you. they definitly have her kind of angry for no reason at all.
a main character without a single flaw would be boring  no
galadriel in the show was a vastly more interesting character than the stay -at-home mommy many male tolkien fans seem to have turned her into.
@sean russell oh no  they updated tolkien s character to better fit a 2020s  audience!
@goblin  you mean how amazon wish galadriel is depicted  because her  singlemindedness on sauron  is depicted as a positive  not a negative.
@cy-one  in literally what was is it depicted as a positive   its by this very nature thatshe brings sauron back  something she is warned against in episode 1.did we watch the same show or do you have the comprehension of a 5 year old
@goblin  you want to try that again without calling people that disagree with you names
@cy-one  if thats your response  Im assuming you ve realized Im right.it was a pleasure opening your eyes to what was right in front of you.
@goblin  so you cant drop the needless hostility then  and instead claim an empty victory where there is none.thats about what I had assumed would happen.
@cy-one  its okay the conversation is over now  you can move on with your life. to bigger and better misinterpretations!
@goblin  Im moving on to burger and salad!
@daniel jones  not every single non tolkien work..lotro puts you firmly and unchangeably on the side of the light.
@profo  the description of galadriel as an amazon only applies to the early first age. by the second age  when this show takes place  she d given up on being a warrior. she was more involved in politics and  magic  at the time. also this description comes from an essay that amazon doesnt have the rights to.
and sauron is literally being helpful as fuck and trying to do his own thing and galadriel drags him all over middle-earth with emotional blackmail and manipulation while he is completely honest with her. ugh.
@profo  its not impossible for her character  but its not her character. amazonian is a height and physicality aspect  we know she was quite adept of body  but her primary characteristic of being a warrior is never written. its always her wisdom  her ability to cultivate  her aptitude of magics  lore  and serene beauty. mistress of magic. this is supposed to be taking place after she learned at the feet of melian  her most useful attributes should be her magic and her very keen diplomacy and influence.
@jeff turner  she has had thousands of years of experience and impactful events leading up to this point. she has learned all there was that the valar  saw fit to teach the eldar  and has spend centuries with the maiar melian. elves dont age like reverse dogs  taking untold thousands of years to be wise. ffs.
and tolkien s galadriel has lots  lots  of fans
@daniel jones  the sequel  shadow of war follows the revenge themes youre talking about. everyone obsessed with vengeance gets screwed.
be me  saurbrand.tfw no angry hamster-elf crossbreed gf. forge one ring in secret.make new nazgul bro friends.get cool new lidless eye look.feel better about things.
sauron is a manipulator and deceiver  he never did anything because of any feelings or otherwise for galadriel  it was his agenda to play her - sauron was always just pure evil and tricks the elves  dwarves and humans into making their rings.  he s playing a long game and even his mighty powers have limits  hence the deceipt game.  she doesnt tell anyone because she s partially compelled
just shows again only doesnt mean the writing will be good.
no idea where you got that from. he just thought galadriel would be useful to have as a servant - albeit a powerful servant. he never loved her  he used her.
@harbl99  hamster-elf
he was evil the whole time  not because of what galadriel did. he was trying to corrupt her to his cause.
@sgxss 2022  sauron wanted to conquor long before he met galadriel in the show. he already viewed himself as a ruler  not because galadriel pushed him to be one. he was just manipulating those around him to further his ambitions.as for the rings  their original purpose as stated in the show is to save the elves from the blight. its no surprise they only made them for the elves. lolol how is she a misogynist   never heard that one before
no  sauron doesnt turn evil because galadriel rejects him. he offered a position for her because she s strong  he was going down the evil route no matter the path she took. the lack of comprehension you show is astounding  though Ive noticed a common thread between the people who hate this show and a failure to understand most of it.
nothing what you wrote here happened in the finale.
@goblin  sure whatever you need to tell yourself to justify bad writing. I understand thatsoy can really mess up your mind.
@shayla  if youreally think sauron turned evil because he was rejected I fear you are beyond comprehensive salvation.
@goblin  exactly! these ppl are just trying to get mad at anything at this point. so much so  they ve blinded themselves to the actual plot of the show.
do you get paid by the hour or by the post  either way  amazon isn t getting their money s worth.
cant decide between rop and she-hulk
@tater  just talking about amazon is promoting amazon  whether you like it or not they re getting their money s worth
@goblin  sounds like you ve been huffing too much copium boyo.
@always has been  twitch user spotted  comment discarded.
@goblin  ah yes dismissing people based on a superficial part of their character instead of on the merit of their opinions. the height of intelligence.
@always has been  what opinion  you didn t vocalise one for me to respond to.seems like youre the one who s been huffing.
@goblin  I was more responding to the general sentiment of your response which still holds validity bruh.
@always has been  but you specifically mentioned me calling you a twitch user instead of responding to an opinion you didn t voice. the height of intelligence.
@goblin  I spoke in a generality as you dismissing me for being a twitch user shows a certain mentality that I can observe and comment on. I know its a bit abstract for your little brain but try to understand
@always has been  I dont think you quite understand  I know spending extensive periods of time on twitch can rot the brain but Im sure you can get this.there was literally nothing else in your statement for me to comment on.
@goblin  and yet again. I didn t say that there was but the fact that your reason for dismissing me is a personal attack on something completely unrelated lol.
@goblin  repeating your same moot point doesnt make you seem smarter.
in the lore  galadriel immediately distrusts annatar  as she was able to pierce his disguise. celebrimbor was blinded and ignored her warnings. thats why she flees.
thats not what happened.  he was always evil and tried to use her  as an ally instead of an enemy and she said no. its  not hard to follow
he spent the entire time trying to not go back to that life  and every step of the way galadriel drug him into it against his wishes. legitimately  they made galadriel the villain of everything.what a mess.
@alex chalifour  the plot of the show is that none of this would have happened without galadriel screwing everything up at every turn  and plot armor protecting every stupid thing she does.have we all forgotten that he was stranded in the middle of the ocean on a raft about to die are we just going to play this  he has magic   game as a way to explain it away   because you know  that didn t help when isildur cut his fingers off of his hand with a broken sword.whatever plot these writers and producers are trying to create  they are failing miserably.you people find this crap believable because youre gullible  and because you want to believe it.  there s lots of us out here that aren t married to the show or its success  so we re not driven to ignore the obvious problems that we see.
@always has been   youre and unfortunately I have to keep repeating my point because itstill hasn t got through your  unusually thick  skull. but if you haven t got it by now I dont think you ever will  our education system really is failing us. its a shame.
@decwow   you people find this crap believable because youre gullible  is an insane response to a fantasy show.
@goblin  thats fucking hilarious! ahahaha you tried to do a youre correction but you were wrong
@always has been  my bad I responded at 6am  you win
@always has been  what other part of your comment did you want me to respond to  the only content within your comment to respond to was your use of twitch chat terminology.not that I d expect a twitch user to have a single solid thought  youre basically a hivemind.although  with the number of responses you ve given me I d say you ve realized some truth in what Im saying. seems Ive really gotten under your skin. living in your head rent free.
@goblin  I didn t. it was a meme and a lighthearted jab that you took oh so seriously and decided to be condescending. could have laughed it off and fired back a similarly lighthearted jab but you lived up to your name aha.ah yes  generalising an entire group of people. the height of intellect .dont flatter yourself buddy  you couldn t get under my skin if you tried . I keep responding because sometimes its fun to observe the missing link to see how they differ from homo sapiens
@always has been  did you not think being called a twitch user was a light-hearted jab  was that a little too much for you     Im sorry for being so mean    I thought you could handle it   my bad bro  I wouldn t have said it if I knew it would hurt your feelings
@goblin   hurt my feelings  funny because I barely even use twitch nowadays. I actually got that phrase from youtube. that wasn t the point though. it was your superior attitude and dismissal of a group of people. the funniest thing is that you must have a level of engagement with twitch to even attribute the meme to it . twitch user spotted
@always has been  the only times Ive seen it used is in the replies of twitch related tweets  and you know what youre right I shouldn t have generalised the twitch community they go through a lot as a community and I think we should have more respect for them  they re heroes really
@goblin  I think that you probably shouldn t generalise any group of people. its the same sentiment people used to enslave africans
@always has been  did you actually just compare insulting twitch users to slavery you are unhinged
@goblin  I knoe your brain struggles to handle the comparison of sentiments. it was not a comparison of severity but of mentality. generalising groups of people when pushed to its logical extremes leads to that kind of discrimination. which is why I try to steer clear of it. did I lay it out for you enough
@always has been  its okay if you think one day we will live in a society in which twitch users are enslaved  really interesting thought process from you actually!
@goblin  this is just amusing now. you should really stop punching thatstrawman dude. what did he ever do to you
@always has been  yet again you fail to make any kind of point or argument then try to blame me for not getting it  youre embarrassing yourself buddy.
@goblin  I thought I never made any points
@decwow  calm down buddy its not thatserious  one day you ll be able to enjoy a good series without your head exploding going over all the theoretical physics behind the show. I believe in you!
@goblin  did you know that there is a buy one get one free offer on rope on atm
@always has been  didn t make any that made sense  itseemed from my perspective that youreally racked your brain trying to come up with one or two. unfortunately  all that came out was nonsense and  copium .
@goblin  another galaxy brain insult here. Imake a bait-and-switch joke about your narcissistic tendencies and you are like  huh huh yo momma . you are just too witty for me bro. I am nothing before your wordsmithing.
@always has been  wow the mom joke really got under your skin there didn t it
@goblin  well  when I see a good series you ll be the first one I recommend it to.  unfortunately  all we have for now is this self-insert wankfest.
@goblin  youre trying really hard to think that I am mad when all I feel is pity
@always has been  dont have to think about it at all  youre tears are obvious for anyone to see
@goblin  your
@always has been  now your grasping at straws! clearly realised your wrong if you have devolved to this!
@always has been  ha! nice try but its pretty obvious your backtracking now  trying to pretend you weren t the one who s been raging this whole time
@goblin  right because my snarky tone and constant use of laughing faces paints the very picture of rage
@always has been  the writing between the lines is plain as day youre shameful attempt at hiding it wont work! its obvious you silly goose!
@goblin  wow  youre so intelligent to be able to know exactly what I am feeling buddy
@always has been  doesnt take much emotional intelligence to be able to do that! its very obvious
@goblin  or a deadly concoction of narcissism and delusion
@always has been  keep telling yourself that  you might start to believe it!
@goblin  yawn youre really invested in me being angry lol
@always has been  not invested just pointing out the obvious
crash the turtle has long been one of the foremost tolkien experts.  and remember my dudes  the story of lotr is fundamentality Christian in sentiment  indirectly at first  but explicitly so in later revisions.
where s razor fist and critical drinker when you need them
@fiction theorizer  razor fist is reviewing rings of power too
@joseph bassey  not that I  m aware. he often uses the bill and ted video clip though.
since the cast was announced.
@rosumparat  since the first teaser trailer came out
@rosumparat  you must be using sorcery at that point. maybe you are the real sauron
and just think  we had to trash all of tolkien s lore and meticulously crafted history  just so we can get some more jj abram s style mystery box.   hey y all!  its lost all over again!!!
@nathan morgan  yeah yeahlost reboot as Lord of the rings is tight
@joseph bassey  how will galadriel survive swimming an entire ocean with no supplies or boat or anything  well  it ll be super easy  barely an inconvenience!
@nathan morgan  its cuz galadriel is tightImeanyou know  figuratively not  you know
@joseph bassey  wow wow wow wow...  on that note  we should  ship   galadriel and that halraun guy.  I think that would be super tight!
now I wish she wrote the scriptsa lot of  dude  n  cool  n  common bro  would be all over it n Im cool with thatas a matter of fact  thats the kind of dialogue I need from season 2. if the want to vandalize tolkien  take it all the way
thats not saying much
hell yea dude ..   wolfenstein young blood vibe  xd
though no one cares about shehulk but a lot of people cares about Lord of the rings so its more painful.
I just wonder  why do people hate watch this anyway  just let it fail on its own  instead of watching the whole thing and complain itsucks.
@guisilva84  content
@guisilva84  exactly. its like punching yourself repeatedly in the balls all the while complaining about the pain.  whack! ow  this hurts! whack! why is this happening! whack!
@v his64  there a lot of fans of the  she-hulk  comics. they care a lot about the destruction of something they like  in the same way fans of lotr do in relation to  the rings of power.
season finales so weak the trailers already gave away the twists.
shehulk is like a parady tho you can laugh at its badness. rop is supposed to be serious so it feels so wierd when you find yourself giggling at the pathetic writing and acting. they are both giga trash tho
@v his64  bcuz they curious after what happen on next ep..and still complaining
season 2 of rop galadriel gonna jump to the writers room and complain about the lore and her character and fix the show!
I feel that. it felt drawn out for the 1st 3 4  and then sped up in the last episode. hopefully they figure out the pacing and cohesion for season 2
@alex chalifour  its going to need a lot more than pacing and cohesion from what ive seen. a new experienced showrunner might save it. no bad reboot and jar jar abrams influence will help too.
@icepicjoey  yeah  I agree it ll take a lot. its possible though and I think we should all give constructive criticism so that the show has the highest possible chance of becoming something spectacular instead of a car crash.
she-hulk and rings of power is a new era of tv shows that your happy to get spoiled on. its like a  we re laughing at you  not with you  type genre now.
just found your channel the other day and this video is absolutely hilarious! the way you gave them all whiney voices had me lmao. also I love all the inclusion of God and verses and such.  new to the journey and love finding people who inspire me like you.
when the heart-foot got stabbed and then you screamed  thank you ! lmao freakin dead.
I couldn t stop replaying the scene where galdriel suplexed tom bombadil unconscious for offering to help her down from her horse. I finally felt up to date with modern times.
the best thing about the show is that all of middle earth could have been sparred sauron if galadriel just drowned like she should have in the ocean after jumping off the boat back in episode one. such contrivance.
please just end these harfoots! two seconds later... thank you!! gold
01 10 the barking of your dogs  and possible back stories  is more  deep and profound  than the entire rop season 1
I thought the same thing when norI s parents were like  no  please  go off with thatstranger man. what kind of parents are you
hail to the king! halbrand   of mordor! hilariously  galadriel is the one who became convinced he was the king of the southlands while he honestly said  yeah I just found it off a dead man s body.
what is it about modern day show and movies where they just absolutely suck  they re suppose to be fiction and not represent reality. hollywood has instilled in us the concept of watching these things as an escape from reality - now thats all they care about  reality. its gonna so bad that Ive had to go back to watching movies from the early 2000 s to stimulate my mind with quality.
here s a simple formula  in order to have a hero  you need a villain for them to oppose. sometimes that villain s the environment  but its usually a bad person or group. the reason everyone hates the harfoots  and rightfully so  is that in order to make elanor brandyfoot the good guy  which isn t a bad idea  she should be a plucky  likable heroine  I d want to watch   the writers pitted her against her own people  a group we re just being introduced to in the series  the harfoot proto-hobbits. that means  the more the writers demonstrate the virtues of the heroine harfoot  the more the other harfoots become villainized. this does not seem like a good strategy in an epic world where the harfoots are already going to be desperate  sneaky and overlook-able just to survive.
your delivery is gold. constantly bring a smile on my face.you would tell a great story to little kids.
I think I can finally watch this series with you as an interpreter. thank you.
lmao!  even the dogs are shook about it. just the splitsecond response time was amazing! so perfect and unexpected!
thanks for recap  you and nerdratic are amazing for helping me avoid this failure
more commentary like this. as bad as the show was your rendition of it made it palatable  lolalso he isn t gandalf he is ga-gao-go-good
melonie - so pleased that the dagger took out one of the harfoots . iv e said it before  .. I absolutely would prefer if they had an additional audio track on the series that was just her narrative.
that tv show had no  wow moments  at all compared to hotd every episodes there s memorable moment
yo mel  the narration from 4 00 onwards should be its own podcast  I would easily sub.
melonie  all good things must come to an endme  I know where youre going with this and rings of powah is the opposite but this is like morphine on a burned body  beyond relief

Im not quite sure what part of rings of power you think represents reality.
thank you
we gave a shoutout to nerdrotic in our first installment  join us for our counter rop series. mae g ovannen! now the evidence is clear  and none can deny that  rop  is not of tolkien. take heart for our  exsurge tolkien that makes robustly clear the heresy of tolkien s canon displayed out of the showrunner s mouths and hearts. they probably know nothing of tolkien s masterpiece  as evident from their interview in the vanity fair article. for  they who proclaim to loveth tolkien  yet understandeth  not his world view can neither hope to create a new film  show  or series of his secondary world.   auta I l me!  and  aur  entuluva!
your impression of the characters was the best part
I wonder if something like your narration with story boards was how the writers presented it to the producers.and the producers were like  thatsounds amazing! let s run it!
your narration of the final episode probably has more likes than the actual show.
mm ... your version of the rop finale actually made the show entertaining as heck! if you do the re-write voice over s of season 1  it actually might be salvageable  although  we might find the re-do in the comedy section.
you breaking down a story is like listening to dark helmet playing with this dolls again in space balls. I love it.
oh that moment galadriel sported the stache told the others to leave the room and shouted to her generals  das war ein befehl! der angriff steiner war ein befehl! oh literal chills  deserves an oscar!
my favorite part of rings of power was when galadriel shot sauron several times after reciting ezekiel 25 17  because sauron failed to heed her warnings about saying  what  one more gd time.
and thats how rings of power will be remembered  creating a new golden age for youtube and pushing everybody capable of holding a pen in their hand to become a writer.after seeing how amazon pick its writers  guess everybody with an opposable thumb is not fully entitled to give it a shot in becoming the next tolkien.oh right  almost forgot  we learned that pebbles and pine cones are deadly to demiGods and capable of doing what gandalf cant.
that was the funniest breakdown Ive seen so far.
I swear  the spectacular voice performance you demonstrated was far more entertaining  than whatever in God s name we witnessed in amazon s atrocity of a show. xd ...right!! it was so weird and downright awkward how guyladriel and her...  brother  spoke the way they did  or at least the way the latter did. thank God that celeborn  the legit galadriel s husband  wasn t present in the show  which was a blessing in disguise  when you think about it.
great recap melonie. especially with those voices  lol. your videos always get me laughing. thanks for suffering through this show for us and finding a way to make it entertaining
love the Godzilla shirt! even the dog dont like this show. this show is very predictable  youre right. your commentary of this show... lmbo! the tick spoon!!!!! youre the best melonie.
omg this is too funny. there s a fine line between comedy genius and a mental breakdown.
you have done us all a great service  melonie  suffering through this entire season to the great enjoyment of many. you ve been my favorite rop reviewer  and thats saying a lot. hear hear!
this is the best episode synopsis Ive ever heard! I want one of these for every episode!
in the silmarillion  sauron takes on the appearance of a handsome elf to convince everyone that he s good  and so plots to destroy the kingdoms of the time. he did not change his appearance to hide who he was but was simply so persuasive and charming that everyone knew who he was but listened anyway. either the writers ignored this or misunderstood  having sauron disguise himself so that everyone is wondering  where s sauron  who is he  which of these characters is secretly sauron  its not a mystery novel! sauron was tolkien s satan  so charming and corrupting that he convinced the numenorean nation to destroy themselves when they knew full well who he was.also  the whole mistaking gandalf for sauron is ridiculous. gandalf  and the rest of the wizards  would have arrived fresh from the land of the Gods  sauron has fallen to corruption for thousands of years. anyone with even a whiff of magic could tell them apart  especially if they re supposed to be sauron worshippers
mel  do you know netflix have released a  eat to rich  the gamestop gaga  limited series  I haven t watched it yet  but its on my list of things to watch
amazingly her voice over is better than the 60 mil an episode writing dialogue of the show.
the real tragedy will be that it will take at least a decade to clear the air to get the opportunity for a proper tolkien adaptation again. that is how bad amazon has screwed this up.
didn t watch the show because screw that  but after watching this recap  I feel like I did. I also feel like the recap was way better than the actual show. and thats what I d call a boom.
its better than the actual show.
@moritz fischer  nahhhh
this is by far one of my favorite @meloniemac go boom videos
the writers are idiots  and they didn t care  it was the worst of both worlds.  I wouldn t actually call them  writers .
what the writers did is exactly in line with your opening point and mirrors the silmarillion .  he s not hiding as halbrand  but using his halbrand persona to deceive and manipulate.  wtf are you talking about.
sauron was tolkien s satan... false  thats melkor.
no sauron did actually hide who he was in order to get the rings forged. he called himself annatar  the  Lord of gifts  the elves did not know who he was. later sauron allowed himself to be captured by the numernorians  still in his pleasant guise  he lost that when numenor sank below the ways and the valar stripped him of his ability to hide himself. see this show know nothing of the lore and instead of looking into it and making the show into some sort of semblance of respecting the lore  we get xena warrior karen  galadriel  wrapped up in the twilight saga. there is no saving this hot pile of garbage.
@jeff turner  there was no halbrand in the books.
@silver scorpio   halbrand would not have been mentioned in either book because the show is a prequel to both
@simon m   bet prime is looking for new writers for season 2 if you think you can do better...
@grubnuz  hence the writer s allusion with halbrand s  gift  of advice to celebrimbor .... so I agree with the first point  but it rather negates your second argument.  then again  I loved xena growing up and the twilight books. forgive these writers for trying to entertain old and new generations of fans - I for one found it refreshing to see a diverse cast with equal female parts vs. another sausage fest of white protagonists killing enslaved black orcsp.s. y all hated it  but watched every second...dare you not to watch season 2
@britt jeffrey  the fuck you mean  prequel to both   this story is based on the silmarillion.
what does  eat to rich  even mean
@britt jeffrey  I ll bet prime is looking for writers as well after the garbage show the previous writers created. any fan could do a better job or really any one who knows anything about the source material.
@silver scorpio  no  its not. they do not have the rights to the silmarillion. its based on the lotr appendices  they are extremely limited in what they can legally use.
@mrarrow54  if you can write 5 seasons using only the lotr appendices without taking creative liberties  I d be extremely impressed.
@goblin  after how low the bar is set with this I would have zero concerns about delivering a superior product. it wouldn t be good compared to the source material but I could easily crush this shows writing. a toddler probably understands what ppl want to see more then these writers.
I dont think you ever read silmarillion  yet pose as a tolkien expert to spread your own agenda.
@mrarrow54  prove it then  until you do that youre just another stranger on the internet playing pretend.out of interest if a toddler understand what people want to see more than these writers  I d be interested to hear your ideas on what we want to see
@britt jeffrey  no they aren t  season 2 has already begun filming!  if you have someone s number I can call please share it
@grubnuz  to be fair  thats insulting to xena.
@goblin   yes  it is. the appendices and the silmarillion take place in the same time period and places in the overall lore. it is in the appendices that the wizards didn t come to middle-earth until the third age  on a boat  not in the fucking meteor . it is in the appendices that galadriel was happily married to celeborn throughout the second age. elrond was a warrior  not a limp-dicked politician. elendil was a great leader and devout follower of the valar. he never had a daughter. and the harfoots didn t exist in the second age and weren t migratory psychopaths. I dont care what amazon has the rights to and what they can and cant use  what they did have access to they made into an entirely different story anyway  and treated the actual lore like easter eggs.
@silver scorpio  Im sorry but Im not reading all that  quick google search will tell you they dont have the rights to the silmarillion.
@goblin  yeah I cantell you dont read. what s the matter  dont get paid enough
@goblin  youre my hero. spitting facts and roasting these dudes
@silver scorpio  they re just pointing out you were wrong in saying it was based off of the silmarillion  when they dont have the rights to the silmarillion. they re just spitting facts
@silver scorpio  its really not my job to educate you  you can do that yourself. I dont value my time particularly highly but I do value it enough to not waste it reading your think piece.
@goblin  I am educated. I read the books. youre the one who s willingly not reading the facts I laid out of what they got wrong from the appendices.
@silver scorpio  I literally never claimed they didn t change things  I said they didn t have the rights to the silmarillion which they do not. youre getting yourself confused.
@goblin  no Im not. youre refusing to read again. and not just my post  you dont know how the legal terms of intellectual properties work either.
@silver scorpio  a single google search  what is the rings of power based on  will tell you it is based on the appendices  not the silmarillion which they do not have the rights to.youre a broken record at this point so I wont be replying again  I really hope you find inner peace.
@goblin  amazon really doesnt hire the brightest bulbs  do they.
@goblin  but if they dont have the rights  why then do something they have no control to begin with ! is such a stupid moves thatshows how little they cares about the product. because if they truly cared for rop they would ve bought all the rights in order to make a perfect adaptation of the simmarillion  and maibe adding some of their ideas without being too oppressive. you know  like jackson did with the original trilogy  in which he paid half of  the expenses for the movies in order to have 3 parts instead of just one  doing the impossible in order to make his dream come true and produce a faithful adaptation of the lotr books. yet those people said  who  we have so little rights at the moment.... anyway let s start filming   proof of how passionles and greedy they truly are  alongside how little they cared about tolkien s lore  since is totally possible to write good original things that aren t lore breaking  but only if you truly care about the original product to begin with  and have the skills to do so . the writers have none of that  they just cared about the project either for the money that will come from it  and also as excuse to jump themselves into bigger projects just like d d did with got.
@mattia silva  they did pay half of the expenses just for the rights they ve got. 500 million of the 1b went to the tolkien estate for the rights. amazon has a lot of money to play around with but there s a limit on how much they re going to pay. like with anyone.I truly hope one day you become capable of enjoying something for what it is. it must be a dark confusing world to live in when youre so cynical. also please structure your walls of text better that was horrible to read.
@mattia silva  stop. feeding. it.
melonie s commentary actually make this show entertaining.
never change  your videos are fire melonie! xd
mel told the story better than the actual show lol!
galadriel  finds out halbrand is sauron  finally   and that he wants to make something out of the mithril for some nefarious purpose.she scares him off  then decides to... make something out of the mithril just like halbrand sauron wanted this makes no sense.
mel s impressions
after the fall of gandalf  the fellowship find themselves in the presence of elves and lady galadriel. she offers them advice  and tools for them to use on their perilous journey.samwise-  I appreciate this rope your majesty  but  did you run out of those shiny daggers  galadriel-  I did have one more dagger a long time ago  but it was used to forge rings of power  after I saved  motivated  helped  and inspired the dark Lord sauron to rise to power in mordor. samwise and the rest of the fellowship-  what the actual fuck !  why  how did you not !  are you mental !
Ive already forgotten the names of the characters in this show.  before this mess I could tell you not just the name of a character but the name of the weapon they carried.  helps that I didn t finish this show  I couldn t.
at least there s no spoilers because nothing could spoil thatshow.
love the commentary and had quite a few laughs but youreally had me at the tick reference lol. still my favorite superhero. spoon!!!
celebrimbor - legendary craftsman for thousands of years  only below feanor.sauron   yo you know about alloys  celebrimbor  mind blown
please describe more things.  I loved it.
you commentary and silly voices are entertaining. I keep smiling throughout the video.
I didnt see the finale and I dont care to but I will watch the hell out of a funny review like this.
the timeline is all screwed over in this series  the rings were created before doom exploded  and the 16 rings for dwarves and humans were created first and the 3 elven rings created afterwards     and really just how they show how far you cantravel in seemingly mere days is like amazeballs
never seen this show before but I dont think it would make sense for that one wizard to be gandalf if this takes place super early in the timeline. I cant remember if there was a maiar above saruman but it would make the most sense for him to be that guy if Im remembering characters right.
hooray more norI in season two.rabid warg attack and messy ending in season 2 strangely enough there was a trailer for the rop finale at the end of this video. wherein either gil-galad or celebrimbor say   this dark knowledge will be ours.  it would be anathema to ghe elves they dont actually discuss it do they
but gil-galad and elrond doubted him and his fair seeming and would not admit him to that land.  so it was guyladriel who actually sniffed out his shenanigans.  good thing she s there. those silly elves.
seventy internet points for animated tick references.  absolutely.
elrond -  how is it you are here  galadriel -  how is it you are here   elrond -  ah  I live here.
I have no context for any of this  but...galadriel   how is it you are here  my mind s response   I walked here.
melonie  halbrand  not sauron  is hot.@starwarsgirl  Im thirsty for henry cavill.
its almost fast travel from a video game.
this was a great series
the moment your just like okay to your dog barking.  both talked about shows were complete trash. interesting how they still dont realize to stop this horror. you crack me up  with your reenactment. you need to do this with an open world video game.
your review was more entertainment than the episode itself
anyone else get the feeling nothing happened this series apart from - galadriel goes to numenor and back  elrond talks to a dwarf and has a few dinners with him  harfoots go from a to b
apparently the show runner is on record for saying we ll give fans what they want in season two. I call bs on that.
I cant wait till next season...just kidding  although I did enjoy your voice acting - you should re-dub videos! very entertaining!
melonie s recap is way more entertaining than the show itself.
could not disagree more! I thought the finale was awesome!
they should ve pumped that budget into the wheel of time it was head and shoulder above this even after suffering major set backs and lack of support from amazon
yeah that brother sister scene was creepy. it didn t help she was smiling back.
wow  so the old man is gandalf and halbrand is sauron. the entire internet definitely didn t already know that after 2 episodes. good job writers!
helbrandt was lanced 6 days ago when the numenorians sailed to numenor. so it officially takes 6 days to sail from middle earth to numenor. also the bird call scene was silly. do they hate owls enough to go chasing them like wtf
then they throw some knives  and they hit one of the harfoots  thank goodness!  lmao!
please do a review of  legend of the seeker . this is a much better fantasy show than  rings of power . just a fun review as a change of pace
yes!!! the tick rocked sorry had to say that. lol youre  totally right thatscene reminded me of that too. they should just call this Lord of the money laundering rings scamazon edition.
I love your analysis and voice over!
Ive read the silmarillion and also listened to the audio version. Ive read the Lord of the rings twice and listened to the audio version once. Ive read the hobbit once. Ive listened to or read all of Christopher tolkien s recent published works including  the children of hurin   and  the fall of gondolin.   the audio version of the  children of hurin  was narrated by Christopher lee and was truly amazing and of course sad. rings of power season 1 was a total failure for me. as a disclaimer I quite part way through episode 5 because I found myself fast forwarding through all the annoying parts  like harfoot  singing  and then I realized I wasn t enjoying the show at all. I found the show boring along with terrible writing  acting  and I didn t like any of the characters. I found myself hoping for their demise. I also didn t appreciate the showrunners calling me a racist right winger for giving the show a 1 star rating. I also dont appreciate you tube recommending all sorts of right wing propaganda now since I watched many videos with negative opinions of the show. oh well  I guess thats the labeling world we live in. tolkien would hate today s society. anyways  I hope most of you commenting on these videos stopped watching it too or stopped along the way. even if you hate the show  you watching it gives amazon the ammo they need to show huge streaming numbers and justify this garbage. please dont let curiosity take you like a shiny gold ring.
all bad things come to an end rings of problems
quality show. queen of voice acting  o
is it just me or was that goodbye scene with the harfoots the longest goodbye in the history of film   if it means we dont have to deal with harfoots anymore  its fine. lol
I doubt it  that d be an admission they haven t given fans what they wanted in series one.
thatshit was in the trailers. lol
youreally think that the writers tried to write a good story  it has  Lord of the rings  in it. isnt that enough
Im a big tolkien fan and I enjoyed rop. I think people take things too seriously. it was never going to be an exact copy of the source material because they wanted to introduce an element of mystery to keep people guessing. its easily amazon s most streamed show and they re currently filming season 2 in the uk. its fine you didn t like it btw  but hopefully you ll realise you ll be happier not watching it rather than moaning about it instead.
@paul2377  I appreciate your reply but I didn t mention anything about it needing to be a copy of the source material. I guess Im too picky when it comes to quality in terms of writing  acting  and creating a story that keeps me engaged. I honestly didn t care for a single character  especially galadriel and the harfoots. it was terribly boring. for a supposed billion dollar venture  they certainly hit way below the mark in my opinion. Ive never seen an episode of got or hod so Im not comparing it to those. also  I d like to say that I dont care anything about race or beards or any of that other nonsense.  -peace
the implication is that norI is the only one who will stick around as a main character going forward.
I like where galadirel threw mankind  off hell in a cell
I have to admit I prefer the episode with your own dialogues and you own actress skills  it gives a kind of rick and morty vibes with   dude you have to wear the crown   Im not sure dude   galadriel I have to explain why youre so great because the writers are not doing a good job  of course without all the insults usually used in rick and morty you should redub some part of the episode for fun
this is the only way I want to watch this show! amazing!!
I think I know its going to suck  but Ive forced myself to watch itso far and its too late to quit
this was the best re-cap of the show ever  1000  more entertaining than the actual show
so basically this is a billion dollar fan fiction shipping guyladrial and sauran
love the voices and reenactment. I felt like I was there
you know I give the showrunners credit for playing everyone all this time the show was about making wamons the bad guys.Im joking I dont think they planed for it to be taken the way its playing out  Imean there is only one why you can read this arc galadriel is on and its not making her look wise or noble
so they throw a dagger and it hits one of the harfoots thank goodness!!!!!!!!!  had me rolling on the floor laughing thank goodness I didn t spend 1 minute of my time watching this dumpster fire.
haven t seen the show but I heard the best part is when gandalf flies into a nuclear missile and says  Im superman .
the way you said thank you floored me
its underwhelming because anakin skywalker turning evil and hanging out on a lava land has already been done.
how did you not catch the harfoot that got stabbed  suddenly didnt have any wounds or bloods for the next three scenes hes in  and all of a sudden hes like  oh shit im out
bahahahahahha  I find your spin on their lines hilarious! when the show first came out I thought sauron was that eminem rip off chick and I thought that chick was a dude. please continue to suffer for our entertainment when season 2 comes out! also laughing about the dogs barking through the video.
melonie your revised dialogue is so much better than the actual dialogue! also so glad we finally learned sauron s true motivation for conquering middle earth was he was an incel who couldn t win the stunning and brave sociopathic fair maiden.
guyladriel logic  a super powerful being that can invade my memories is trapping me within my own mind. to discover if Im back in reality  let me ask this person in front of me about a memory of mine to prove he is who he is.
so I watched first and  final episode of that masterpiece melonie  what did Imiss   nothing I hear u say  d
even the dogs didn t like it 1 12
I think the stranger is one of the blue wizards. I bet the series will end with them introducing gandalf in the series finale  if this dumpster fire were to run as long as they would like it to.
you know this is why I am giving up with modern shows nowadays. but there is one show that has my heart. one show I will never hesitate to watch. transformers animated. I recommend to watch it. looks like a kids show. but later in the show it picks off the part of the kids part of it.
well considering people keep watching and talking about it they ll keep making it lol
thank you for the brief summary. you saved me 45 minutesedit  great dubbing btw
you continue to look great melonie! you have such a positive upbeat attitude as well!!
deep and profound finding nemo quote. ima use that one.
watching critiques like this exceeds the entertainment value of the original series. funny as hell and far more informative....
finale was great! I get people are making videos to attract viewers and make a quick buck but dont smash a great show!
then the heartfoots    are like  ha ha!    made me chuckle.  have you done voicework before
come on dude  such tolkienian language  I love it  still better than the rop dialogue at any rate  you should dub the whole show over  p
I need to watch this show and the she-hulk show through the mac filter
I love this series
I thoroughly enjoyed the dude-bro language in your review
yeah  I just recently rewatched the Lord of the rings trilogy and the hobbit  but I will not give even 2 seconds of my time to rings of power on principal alone  just from the recaps Ive seen  yours included  and itshows Ive made good decisions not to
I d rather just watch melanie do the replay like a kid w  toys than the actual terrible show
you know that the gandalf dude could very well be saruman who was originally played by Christopher lee
as an englishman Im sorry that you had to endure lenny henry in this show. he s about as entertaining as cramp.
recap was better than watching the actual show.
melonie you are hilarious....love your review......lol
and yet your synopsis is better than the actual episode...
all good things must come to an end  but the terrible things last forever.and guyladriel is the bestest worstest evar. good job  amazon  good job.
thought the series got stronger  enjoyed the finale.
I just watch these bc I think the  go boom  part is cute
I really wished they d put in a scene where the high king sees galadriel is back and he looks at her and says  this bitch  shakes his head and walks out of the room  lol
lol love the impressions during the recap
Im not gandolf ... Im goodolf. genius!!
@1 11 haha the dogs tried warning you  that was great
ugh  men! -literally every show in 2022
youre a trooper for actually watching this garbage for us. ty
ok so I watched a few episodes and she convinced him he was the southern king.  it was a whole thing and they forgot about in just for another bad story line.
I liked the voices you did for the characters  lol
it was a great episode  looking forward to season 2.
melonie my dude got jokes
when that one guy said you  you have to call me nighthawk!  it was epic! but then the other guy says   you have to call me dragon.
lol your recap of the episode is really funny hahahaha
the reference to the the tick was so good.
the rings of power series is nice and the sauron parts are good
every time I watch this show I cant stop thinking of those old fruit of the loom underwear ads.
I prefer melonie s version of the story.  come on dude.
I think I finally got it. we are seeing middle earth through the pov of sauron. he ll be the hero in season 2.
so gandalf is gandalf and sauron is sauron. didn t seen that coming...
you do the  Im too stupid to breathe on my own  voice really well. did you grow up in california
well  you made it entertaining!
agreed! I fully understand not everyone will like it and thats fine. what I dont get are why melonie and - judging by the comments - 99  of her audience kept watching the whole thing if they hated itso much.
this is by far your best video.
I cant wait for sauron s redemption arc
and it hits one of the harfoots thank goodness  lol
bro did they create the rings on a whim  like  hal brand just casually was walking though the lobby of the house and was like . nice rocks bruh  should totally build some magic rings just for fun. heh. anyway  Im outy thanks for healing me. dont look into my history or nothing thanks for healing me. again  just saying you guys should totally make some rings though for real. we can get the forge together and get this figured out and finished by tonight my dude s. did the writers of this show give the creation of the rings the tech-bro treatment! !  like it was just a whim that they decided to try out and it ended up either being the best or worst  but it didn t matter cuz  move fast and break things  you know like e .holmes did
he s gandalf but most likely will not use the name in the show
galadriel really needed to loose her dagger anyways.. she tried to stab close to every person she met.
our daughter is going on an adventure with this old wizard. what could possible go wrong they could film it and put it on a prime video streaming service.
what happened to the balrog   it was the pic preview for ep lol. did they forget about it.
I liked it when the facehugger came out of halbrand and shot john conner.
omg your commentary is hilarious!!
alright Ive been looking  forward to this. thank for enduring this awful show for us melonie
great finale.
throws a dagger and hits one of the harfoots thank goodness  lolllll
it was more fun watching your review than watching the show. very cool young lady.
when they put the mithril in the gold  it looks like the eye of sauron. Im sure they thought that was clever.
the concept to have some romantic tension between galadriel and sauron in his handsome mortal form  while he still had it  isn t so horrible  even if it is not in tolkien s lore. the execution of this concept was awful  however. in order to have done it right  there are some things thatshould have been done very differently - sauron should have been a truly charming  yet malevolent seducer and manipulator  capable to affect even galadriel with his powers to convince and persuade. he would have almost succeeded in turning her to his side.- celeborn should have been introduced in the very first episode and they should have said his body was never found  but is believed by everyone to be dead. this way galadriel has a far stronger motivation to seek revenge and keep fighting  both in her brother and her husband s memory.- this way there would be a meaningful story arc for galadriel  as we see how  after struggling a lot both internally and externally  and having successfully stood the test against sauron s attempts of seduction  she becomes wiser  less rash  more careful and more responsible towards wielding great power. this would then have given her the needed gravitas to be a bearer of one of the rings of power.I know it would still be completely noncanonical and pure fan fiction  but it would still have been a hundred times better than what we got.
I hope we see more chrisopher fuck as the mayor in season 2  assuming season 2 is actually released. this has such strong female doctor who energy it may actually be responsible for destroying prime video.
Im going to call them muse valkyries but I thought they were well designed they were creepy. they look like they got lost on their way to model for a fashion show
sauron is just some hippie looking dude in a hoodie walking thousands of miles to mordor I laughed my ass of at that final scene
all good things must come to an end.unfortunately this show isnt one of them.
aw shucks  thank you
@melonie mac go boom  youre welcome
melanie s voices are spot on
many actually believe the good wizard is either alatar or pallando  one of the blue wizards  which would make more sense since gandalf did not arrive until the 3rd age.  however  it is amazon so does lore really matter
even her dogs think itsucks  there like  turn thatshit off! turn that disrespectful garbage off now!
imagining Lord celebrimbor  grandson of feanor and greatest smith of his time  saying to elrond and others  yo  this isn t working out  my guy   was more entertaining than the whole of this misbegotten abomination of a show haha
end these harfoots! Im ded.
galadriel   oops  my bad!  I ll pretend nothing is wrong  that Im not a total moron who saved sauron and helped him with his evil plans! I ll lie to celebrimbor and say we need 3 rings  um...for balance  that way I ll get 1 and go and hide in some nice safe woods  lothlorien perhaps  and just wait as all the terrible things I set in motion play out and everyone else dies. when I get another invitation to valinor  Im outta here!  tolkien made the real galadriel the wisest of all beings  she knew sauron s mind immediately  long before anyone else even suspected  yet sauron could not touch galadriel s mind  so how does sauron take over galadriel s mind in rop! galadriel is so powerful that when orcs attacked lothlorien she realized sauron was behind it and destroyed the whole of dol guldur  also known as the hill of dark sorcery  sauron s stronghold and base of operations in mirkwood  with her magic.  think of it as a smaller barad-d r and mount doom . the show-runners actually think that by turning the wisest being into an idiot with a sword they ve empowered her  which means they re idiots. rop is character assassination.
I cant wait for the rushed season 2  its gonna be glorious. not that Im gonna watch it  just only reviews like this one lol.
thank you for watching this shitshow so I didnt have too oh and nice 1960 s Godzilla shirt.
even the dogs didn t like the lame finding nemo quote lmao  d  that was great.
your recap reminded me so much of luis from ant-man
your version of the episode is way better than the real thing.
so they turned her into the speaker of the house. I haven t seen any of it yet  so itsounds like I haven t missed anything
loved frakerzog from the tick. favorite villain
this is what happens when the showrunners think they know better than the author of a long standing book franchise and completely piss all over his legacy as well as his grave. Im not shocked. lol
as a tolkien fan I feel like I needed a shower after every episode of this farce.
what if the old man isn t gandalf  but saurmon  didn t he used to be a good guy until he was corrupted by sauron  I haven t read the books all the way through  and I dont know the lore  so I could obviously be wrong.
what s your take on cdpr going esg not gonna support a company thats pushing that no matter how overrated edge runners is.
gandalf the homeless now speaks!
first off  I need to thank you for watching this for me. your sacrifice will be remembered for ages to come. I was unable to make it past episode 2.
he could be one of the blue wizards.
always follow your nose! he s 100  gandalf.
thatsummary was way better than the actual show!
I love how guyladriel screwed up all.her face when she realized about halbrand   sauron s plan.greetings from costa rica.pura vida.
we re in the matrix  its all a game  a thought experiment.  -erin valentI  utah tech ceo with no history of mental illness  found dead in backseat of own california rental car  days after going missing calling her parents   ------ 33yrs old  2019 october     she was researching computer-brain interface systems
awesome something to fall asleep on later
Im just baffled at how they  the followers  mistake gandalf for sauron  wtf.
how does an elven blacksmith who s been doing blacksmithing for eons does not know how to fuse metals   it took a blacksmith from the southlands to teach and elf how to make alloys.and why does guyladriel all of a sudden not trust halbrand just because celebrimbor said  power over skin . so that was the only vibe that made guyladreil distrust halbrand. nothing sus for the last 6-7 episodes. nothing until this one comment.
galadriel  from rop  has about as much chemistry as the noble gases.
melonie said  grab my staff  and all I heard was  pull my finger
your narration and voiceovers we re definitely the treat of this video.
he s still a thousand years too early
I like melanies version of this episode sooooo much better. amazon should just hire her to do dubbed voiceovers for all the characters in all the episodes. atleast then this billion dollar crapshow would be entertaining
melkor himself couldn t have corrupted a tolkein story more than this if he tried.
love the Godzilla shirt.  gandalf  looks like gary!!
sauron gave galadriel the grond!
how is it you are here   how is it you are here  imagine replacing and rewriting tolkien s work with this crap.thanks bezos
I love your Godzilla shirt melonie.
never let people forget that rop made guyladriel the ultimate evil. greater then morgoth and definitely greater then sauron  for the evil that middle earth will face in the third age and the creation of the rings in Lord of the rings  and sauron s return  all of these was the evil emotional manipulation and blackmail of the ultimate evil  guyladriel.
1 13 even they cant stand this show
Im sensing a pattern here. she-hulk has a garbage finale and then rings of powers has a garbage finale. there is a correlation that I think we are all starting to see in these shows. the same kind of people that ruined she-hulk have also ruined Lord of the rings.
hold up. so its not even sauron as annatar that convinces them to make the rings   what the actual hell is going on with this show. this is on some percy jackson s  t at this point.
and then  even though she knows what his plan is...she wants to make the rings anyway!
@simon m  exactly and like a mary sue just walked away without face any kind of punishment for her mistakes  not even a talk with her only friend about it  c mon youre kidding me.
bahaha
melkor actually respects lore  he wouldn t even touch tolkein
the last shot of hallbrand sauron looking at mount doom plotting to make the one ring looked badass to me  tbh.
he s not gandalf  he s one of the two blue wizards  gandalf level .
her recap is top notch
Im more interested in what your parents dogs were barking at than who is sauron
I think the funniest comment on nerdrotic was that they are going to make the show unesco heritage site because its the only dumpster fire that can be seen from the moon.
quoting the tick makes you the best ever. thanks for the vid
thats like the best paraphrase Ive ever heard
your version should have been the script  like literally word by word of what you said at least it could have been funny
pupper cameo!
worse than we feared.
the only way they can redeem this is if season 2 drops everyone else and is solely about the adventures of tom bombadill. I would forgive them  then.
yourecapping was a better production than the aired one.
I have a pretty good attention span  ring of power challenges that
they ve accomplished one thing this season. they ve made everyone hate hobbits.
season finale  guyladriel attempts to cancel halbrand
what is amazing is the harfoot storyline has zero relevance to anything else in the series. if you cut it out  nothing would change.its also fucking hilarious galadriel knows without a doubt who sauron is and tells nobody. and so everyone keeps using his ideas about ring making. it really comes off as if galadriel is actually evil. she rejects sauron because she hates sharing.why an architect isildur s sister  is brought in to do sketches of a person is really strange to me too.
im heartbroken I never watched a single episode and lack an amazon prime account and just instead enjoyed all the trainwreck lolcow milking reviews.
they dont have the rights to gandalf  so it could be saruman or another wizard  gandalf is not the only one.  dunno if they have the rights to saruman
Im falling in love with your dismissive tone  lol
best recap .....  ever.
he is not not gandalf.
we need melonie as a regular on fnt or tnme!
sauron  galadriel  Ive got something big to tell you....   Im sauron!!!!galadriel  surprised pikachu faceaudience  called it from word go.
turns into the creepy version of feminem
watching amazon torch a billion dollars with gasoline might have been more amusing for the sheer hubris of it than this show. then again their sheer bleeping hubris believed they could write a better story than tolkien.
me  how s it goin sauron  2 10
meanwhile perrin and faile s adventures in edmonds field in chapter 43 of  the wheel of time book 4  the shadow rising  has been a joy to read. go read those books and stop watching bad shows people.
dunking on it has been infinitely more entertaining than the show  its great amazon invested billions of dollars so youtubers can get so much good content out of it!
you good   Im good.
note to everyone who are reading this  stop letting screeching hell harpies be ceo of anything
halbrond was salmon! ! !  who could have guessed
and he came against them with open war  demanding that all the rings be delivered to him  since the elven smiths could not have attained to their making without his lore and counsel. his lore and counsel amounting to what exactly    could make some rings outta that  and   do it gently   ! ! ffs.
its funny how they made the creation of the 3 rings a matter of great importance that had to be completed on a short time table...and they still took the time to make the rings ornate   fancy instead of simple bands. makes about as much sense as the rest of this show.
pretty sure the only people watching this show at this point are youtubers that watch it to review it
nice! that was fun.
this is hilarious lol
I liked the whole season
the problem is amazon and their bastardization of the work. j.r.r. tolkien tried to get the the book published but the publisher said no. Christopher  respected his fathers works and defended it to the very end. it is only now after his death that things have changed.amazon does not even have access to the original works. only the appendices.
you know how they could fix it  by saying  yeet!  every few seconds.
why did galadriel believe thatsome random ass stranger who pulled her out the sea was actually the heir to the southlands  the guy literally had no proof except a sigil. what was halbrand sauron doing mucking around in numenor for so long I really dont understand
might be time for the tolkien estate to pull the plug on this.
I think they didn t name gandalf because of the issues with the rights  but saur---  amazon  acquired some more of them so they might be able to name him next season  unfortunately.the writers not having galadriel warn people about sauron because it would make her look bad just shows what rotten people they are  since they cant write a good and wise and charitable person as anything but someone working an angle  and cant imagine someone doing the right thing even at cost to themselves. its a bit like in tolkien how the villains cant correctly anticipate the good guys since they imagine their plans as being like their own  in the end nothing but quests for power. if anything what they ve created is not a non galadriel character  but an actively anti-galadriel character and they still think she s good. this is how you cantell these writers are patently evil.one note for the lore is that all the rings were forged by and for the elves  first various minor rings and then sixteen proper rings of power  not sure if sauron helped with the lesser ones but his hand helped in forging the greater rings in his guise as annatar  the giver of gifts . the three rings for the elves were forged by celebrimbor in secret after he stopped trusting annatar who had no direct hand in their creation  but because they re based on his craft the one ring still can still influence them. this is partly how the elves kept those three from him  and they always kept their locations secret.
amazon could ve adapted raymond e. feist s riftwar cycle  a popular  naturally diverse  epic high fantasy saga written by a hispanic author  real name  raymond e. gonzales iiI  for peanuts. as we say in hungary  they need to suffer like Christ on the cross for this.
Im so dead!!!
they really just threw out the lore entirely at this point didn t they  I could write an entire book about why this is all wrong from this video alone.
okay your review with the dogs barking in the background is so much better than the show. cheers
but I thought sauron didn t have anything to do with the forging of the three. I thought the 7 and 9 were crafted first. I thought they made many lesser rings that were  trifles  and  essays in the craft  before forging the great rings. I cannot be the only one utterly disgusted by this show
then il vatar spoke  and he said   mighty are the ainur  and mightiest among them is melkor  but that he may know  and all the ainur  that I am il vatar  those things that ye have sung  I will show them forth  that ye may see what ye have done. and thou  melkor  shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me  nor can any alter the music in my despite. for he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful  which he himself hath not imagined.   the silmarillion
yo galadriel  you have a man who treats you like a queen  want to marry you  give you the world  create a business together that will last forever and youreject him for the people that throw you out and treated you like you were crazy. I just dont get it....... he should have stay single in numenor  s
men having fun!   how dare they!  galadriel  the 1st feminist.- let that harfoot be forever remembered as  that guy that got thrown the dagger on. - now Im no tolkien  superfan   but I could ve sworn thatsauron used an elf-like appearance when he charmed the elves into forging the rings.  I ain t seeing an  elf-like appearance   here. anyway  thanks for watching this and giving us the play by play  so that we dont have to watch it... which I never had plans to anyway.  I ll stick with my expanded editions of  the Lord of the rings  trilogy dvd sets  thank you very much.  I will never get rid of those.
so  not gandalf  banished susan saran wrap  michelle pfeiffer and cher to where
mr krabs would be crying blood at the amount of money wasted!
the best moment of the series is when poopy the harfoot started crying .. at least she wasn t singing
thanks for watching this so I dont have to.  God bless your heart
lol great reactions. your summary was better than the whole show.
haha I was gonna start it once the last episode came out. now um I kinda dont wanna waste my time
tell me its not hilarious when she wants to dunk on the sauron reveal and instead gets lost in his eyes.
I was screaming at my tv during the harfoot gal leaving the group with gandolf.  it was so drawn out and lame  making a frodo sam of the opposite sex thatseemed like it was half the episode
light magic makes him saruman.
Im still cringing from that terrible dialogue between the harfoots and knock-off gandalf at the end. it was trying sooo hard and fell so flat. some of the worst writing in a tv show I have ever seen  I was yelling  please stop  please end  please be over!  at my tv. I cannot do another season
man  bezos  son is going to be ticked.
well gandolf doesnt come to middle earth until 1000 third age. unless they blatantly break lore which is entirely possible now that the estate is under the control of people who want tons of free money. Imean just because something wasn t written in the past doesnt mean you cant add to it in the future. it happens all the time. but I dont remember any mention of a gandolf being around in physical form during the creation of the rings. I do remember a elrond telling a gandolf that he was there 5 000 years ago for epic battle etc etc etc. so since we are about 5 000 years from the lotr movies in this show  its safe to say its a renta gandolf just like the hobbit girl is renta frudo and the renta sam is sooooo going to tail renta frudo until caught. oh look guys! renta sam is here too!!!!! you gotta hit all the marks for those money shots baby  we paid a billion dollars for this! gonna throw in renta legolas  renta gondor sights  and renta rohan helmets to boot. Im not a huge fan I dont know the lore in and out  but these are my observations of yet another movie show hitting you hard with the member berries because they lack all capability to imagine and create content without ripping off what we ve already seen. at least they had no choice but to create the dwarve content almost from scratch.
with how terrible the rest of the episodes have been  the finale never could have been good or even decent.
normally  I hate spoilers for movies and show. however for this series  I dont really care as I dont have plans to watch it any time soon and not at all invested in this  fan  fiction. I still have the lotr and even the hobbit movies.
of course it did. I didn t even need to watch the first episode to foresee that.
your recaps are much more entertaining than the actual show.
hello melonie I wanted wish u to havea wonderful relaxing weekend I  your emotions seeing the Lord of rings series finale.takecare melonie
refusing to watch the show because how bad it is. will tune in next season though. please give us episodes 1-7 the same dubbed treatment as you did on this episode. this is so much more entertaining than the first. 2 episodes I watched   I legit fell asleep on episode 2
I love your hair
was that gandalf or saruman
this elrond I wont trust with 10 soldiers rather than a realm . he will leave his armies on gates of moria just to meet his friend for 3 days .
careful  they be strong with that dmca.
Im cheering for the orcs to win. who else would join Lord father
why is norI even leaving with the meteor man
is that a needler
I can def sense her frustration toward the end watching this vid.. but I just cant stop laughing at her narration bits. .. thanks  I feel like I watched it effectively- by not watching it.. but still feel bad you had to.
me   my familia shop at amazon all the timeyeah  we shop there  get the things we want   asked for  ignore amazon prime   got the hell out of dodge
I refuse to watch the show  but I cracked up laughing watching this
the show was just sad. Imean its a billion dollar disaster a train wreck.  you know if I had a billion dollars to work with for a show first of all I would leave tolkien s work alone but let s just say I am going to do something based on Lord of the rings   first I would stick to the source material or I would place it in an alternate time line . either way I would do it where it makes sense and not confuse the audience.  it would be more of a dungeons and dragons type of thing.
imagine my shock
I doubt it is that big of a failure because they are making a season 2  Imean in their definition of failure.  cause all they care about is the money.  best part of this video though is your tshit  thats some quality Godzilla merch.
why does galadriel always look like she rolled out of bed
because the plot needs her to.
@moritz fischer  ahhh... another  for convenience s sake  like jumping into a middle-of-nowhere ocean to be rescued twice!!!
@thomasc  okay  jokes aside  norI is a very adventurous  curious woman  not like the other haarfoots. she wants to see the world and what is out there. she mentioned that in the first few episodes. the meteor man was her call of adventure. however that doesnt explain what she will do when the meteor man found what he was looking for. and galadriel...yes that was the textbook definition of plot convenience. but she is super-woman  so why not.
@moritz fischer  hobots were so annoying after two episodes  I fast-forwarded whenever the show switched to them  I have no idea norI s personality. when bilbo cosby was dying  I wanted to see the rest of them just leave that creepy old fart  to be left behind  just like others he left behind.
this review is far more entertaining  you have barking celebrimbor
well  the people dont call it the most expensive fan-fiction  and one of the worst  for nothing. if at least the story was actually good  interesting and fun... at least we make our own fun with it. good and funny video  you should make videos like this more often.
no it didn t  it was good
elrond   when we met I was a poor  wee orphan! galadriel   yes. I remember. you are my friend elrond half-elven. wait  didn t your twin brother  elros tar-minyatur  who chose to be a mortal man  die after he  and  therefore  you also  had lived five hundred years  do immortal beings over five hundred often lament their being an orphan  and was your immortal parents  e rendil and elwing  really dead at the time of our first meeting  elrond   enough of me. how ve you been
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt   ruin what good forces have invented or made.                                        j.r.r. tolkien this is exactly what jennifer salke   her merry band of malicious animals are doing
the estate needs to take back the rights before its permanently damaged if its not already to far gone this could of been amazing.
I dont say this to exaggerate  but I dont think they could destroy so much of the lore without intentionally trying to do wrong by all of the characters and stories of tolkien. like complain about the race and gender politics all you want  but all of that is honestly the least of the story s problems  they ve just gone through and methodically butchered every character and every fantasy element  it feels like we are being straight gaslit to pretend like this wasn t intentional destruction.
pretty sure the wizard is saruman maybe...its a dumb idea  but its rings of power...so...
I dont understand  why is finn from adventure time a cultist of morgoth now  this show make brane hurt.
thanks for watching rings of power so I dont have to.
I know nothing of the lore and Ive only seen the original trilogy of lotr once so I went into this show viewing it as a standalone thing with that being said the show was very iffy to me but I enjoyed the finale and its payoffs. however I dont like the fact they used false promotion to make us think sauron would be a big part of this season. he never even showed up besides a flashback. thats why I hate trailers and companies who use them to manipulate viewers into watching their show. pretty salty I didn t see sauron  just some dude eluding to being him. either way it was a 5 10 from a casual viewers viewpoint. also great video as always  keep pumping them out!
this was far more entertaining than the real thing. they could have saved a lot of money and just made an audio book with a slide and still gotten the essentials out of it.
wow! at 1 10  its like it is confirmed that rings of power is so bad that your pet cats and dogs are crying out for it . . . . . to end
the show s subreddit is hilariously delusional.
they should have spent that 1 billion of hiring peter jackson to make a new Lord of the rings movie  instead of the boring show.
I was more invested in the mystery of the loud and sudden barking than in anything this show had
a high school drama class could have made a better production than this over-hyped  over priced  broken misrepresentation of tolkien. hard pass to even watch this  thanks melonie and the rest of youreviewers for helping me avoid this garbage.
who s really evil now  amazon
my favorite part is when gandalf said  its wizarding time  and wizarding all over those nazguls
boromir dies in fellowship of the ring  damn thatsucks  lennie henry dies in rings of power  yes! finally!
90  of quotes in youtube comments are fake.    benjamin franklin
I think the shows awesome. I also think for myself and dont jump on hate trains. all the book nerds complaining about this show are pathetic but everyone s entitled to their own opinions
stop it  rings of power was amazing and everyone knows it.
so the gandalf character said  I am groot!
imagine spending so much time covering and bringing attention to something you hate. such logic.
I arthur!!! I love the tick!!!!
the part when chuck norris proposes to galadriel after she swims back the whole ocean and survives a volcanic eruption. so inspiring and brave... of him.

lol dude perfect break down!
1200 years too early for gandalf. God. the smith guy is sauron. shocker. yawnsauron is annatar. he s named   he s not named halbrand. gandalf is not in this part of the story. hamfisted and he s not really here. sudden and inevitable betrayal. yawn.  this is not a shock.almost never hear a good tick reference. elrond knew  who sauron was.   the elves forged the three rings secretly after the  seven and the nine were made. for a story about the rings of power there is only one episode about the actual forging of the rings and they seemed to have missed on some details
hey there are people who like this show. I saw one of them.I think I saw one of them... maybe I did  it might have been an exhaustion dream.
the final was so awesome  it was so non-tolkien  yet it was tolkien if he d written in depth about the second age. I love lotr and have a limited set from each of the last four decades. I dont worship or breathe tolkien but enjoyed his tales. I guess next season will cover the dwarves  the third  men and then the war begins for the final season. I give the finale an a and the overall season a 3 5
I actually liked this show. yes  a lot of filler and maybe not the greatest execution on some stuff  but this is meant to be an introduction leading up to the Lord of the rings. I honestly think seasons 2 and up are going to be significantly better now that the show is going with sauron s reveal.
see no evil Lord hear no evil Lord.
thank you for doing the commentary  now I dont have to watch this garbage show. I stoped after episode 4 lmao. thank you for going through a boring show and making it entertaining lol.
dark helmet playing with his dolls
Imean  I totally get sending norI with gandalf... as haarfoots have only women in their tribe  except noris father the dead leader and one or two more... its a good choice to send her with any man... haarfoots know how to survive - other than women  letting the only fertile women in the whole southlands have only one kid... ready to extinct...
I thought it was great! the first few episodes of the season were slow going but I thought it really picked up in the latter half. I dont much care about the lore  it was never meant to be an exact retelling of source material because that would take all the mystery out of it. besides  amazon worked with tolkien s estate so they were clearly fine with the changes. also I dont understand the woke accusations. omg they made a female elf that fights. and  omg some of the cast weren t white. and  its a literal fictional world. no one was non binary or gay  to my knowledge  but the way some of the fandom is acting you d think every second character was.
great video  but you may want to touch up the audio or have someone look into for you. thanks!
Ive seen better written stuff done in crayon by a small child in a fever delusion.  no surprises  no intelligence  nothing good enough to be an elementary school play.  everything blindingly obvious and completely stupid from the get go.  the essence of everything of supposed value in this entire series could be shown in a ten minute infomercial.  the three witches were the best thing in the show  mainly because they didn t do much other than provide an ominous presence which was cool  and they had next to zero dialogue which only improves characters in this show since the more people talk the dumber and more worthless they become.
its cool that you watched the tick.
oh honey...
found jeff bezos
@jeremiah  haha. I wish I had his money!
the writing gets the most criticism as well itshould but outside of galadriel I think how terrible the acting is gets overlooked. its universally laughable save one or two exceptions
this shows budget makes waterwater look award winning compared to this turkey of a show.
lol I dont even need to watch the show because I can just watch your version plus on the upside Im sure your version of it is actually way better
let s be honest here  in this au fanfiction  if it wasn t for galdriel s incessant nagging  sauron would be happy and chill  doing blacksmith work in numenor  drinking with the locals. well gee  thanks galadriel!
in german we call the way yourecap   biteing sarcasm
witch-king in the books  slaughters kings  crushes armies  conquers cities and kingdoms and then summons evil spirits to haunt the ruins. witch-king in the show  starts a few fires and hits a leprechaun with a batarang.
I cant watch the fake hobbitscenes. I just wanted to watch to see if sauron was sauron  Imean fake halbrand .  and they even messed that up. sauron was not scary  no threat  and the actor played him too nice. plus  it would have been cool if his voice or face changed to his true form... but no  sauron remained as a male model. plus  instead of gandalf  they should have made him saruman instead  now that would have been cool. I give it 2 out of 5. bad writing  average acting  and ok special effects.
she loves the series she keeps watching it   lol    is because of Lord sauron   lol
dear Lord! I know I shouldn t comment but I notice all your videos lately are about you complaining about stuff you dont like! the fact you watch all episodes of both rings of power and she-hulk knowing you dont like what they did with the series is just weird! girl is there anything you like these days are do you only know how to complain  hahaps  I do agree with the video you did about tomb raider and I do share your apinion on that!but I dont understand why you dont post about games series movies that you do like! you spent somuch time making videos just to complain and it wont change a thing
did he actually tell them  Im good     please tell me that was an edit and not the real show
the scene where the gandalf adjacent is facing eminem and his posse is just another scene where the writers rip-off peter jackson s movies. desperately going for the scene where gandalf tells balrog to  go back to the shadow .
no  it didn t suck  it was epic finale. I love it!  3
4 50 I dont feel so good mr. stark
so much hate this series gets  I honestly believe fanboys are impossible to please. of course  everyone has the right to do so  but yeah I enjoyed it. I would advise people who hate something  to not go and see the rest. why would you do that to yourself  unless you enjoy the constant talking sh.. about something you despise.I somehow manage to get through the she hulk series  it wasn t amazing  but the finale was so bad  for me. but then to go on the internet and week after week share the same sh.. about a series I think was bad  got better things to do.now I get it  you like the original books  the movies  and this isn t in line with it. for you this was bad  for me it wasn t  and the world still continues!
omg u are hilarious!!  the old hard foot looks like a bill cosby hobbit!!
Im going to disagree sis.. I enjoyed it
pls tell me where you got that Godzilla shirt
she can shake hands with kristen stewart.
not to argue  but I really liked it.  Im ok with the liberties taken.  I still enjoyed it.
melonie  I noticed you watching I pirated version of the show   you are so based to be honest. I did the same thing  except I downloaded because I have slow wifi
not true at all. sauron wanted to conquor middle earth long before he ever met galadriel. he tried it once before when he served morgoth. the dude was even alive before the creation of middle earth  and was the assistant to the God of the forge. he d never be content just chilling in numenor.anyone who is pushing this  sauron is evil because galadriel  idea has lost the plot.
I am sorry  these words were spoken by the stranger in this show.
finally someone using his brain here still dont know why people try so hard to make jokes around the show while  you can enjoy it and believe me even the story is different from the books and im a fan of  lore but I accepted it and im enjoying watching the series and we cant blame amazon for not following the whole source material just because tolkien estate refused to  sell the copyrights for amazon  netflix and hbo and someone from netflix in an interview said that they tried to make a lotr series but its so hard to make a deal with tlokien estate they make things impossible but this youtuber is doing tyhis  just for her content but its not a honest review
hope this show doesnt get another season I dont know what s worse this or she hulk
Ive had many names. -lucifer
the entire show quite bad to be honest. at the start  around ep2  I had hope thatsome kind of plot would start to reveal itself  but instead we got a series of things happening and not a  plot . just all around confusing how this script got that kind of budget. it feels like either something written by an aI  or the doodles of junior high drama-cub students on a napkin when they try to brainstorm ideas for their play and they then tried to fashion one story out of all of them.
its ringing time
omg you love the tick! I rarely find people irl who do.
dumpster fire.....what about this reaction
I am still confused how three rings well save all elfs   they all need the light didn t they say that  this show is  the reason im balding
melonie. what a girl like you think  how you handle it  being pretty. are you use it without second thought  do you ever thinking about those without it
what is more entertaining than rings of power   content creators talking about rings of power.
...watched the show and it was a solid 7. but the money is in the grifting.
Im disappointed that it wasn t feminem.
what happened to the other 16 rings! ! they rushed that process so fast!!! it took one afternoon to forge the 3 most powerful rings in middleearth!   notmymiddleearth
air bending and earth bending.
they should donate billion to people in need instead spending it for these mess of the show
sara-on.
I know she s a fictional character  but her behavior is so illogical and unbelievable. or maybe it was just horrible writing.
heelsvsbabyface called the witches  nasgals
any time the harfoots appear  its an automatic skip. they kill the pacing every time   their scenes are dragged out way too long. the finale was like 75  harfoots. season 2 needs way less of them.
1 12 the series is so bad that for a moment I thought the dogs were a series editing error
give me the meat..and give it to me raw.
the problem is the fact that they changed the lore to begin with. the three rings do in fact prevent the major elven lands from fading  lindon  eregion  and lorien   but the show implies the elves will lose their immortality and they need to be exposed in close proximity to mythril to prevent that from happening  which is not the case at all originally.
@david conway jr.  what about all the mythril they needed to mine  did that end up happening  itseems like they just put the small chunk they had in the rings and whoosh! all better!
your tats are awesome  by the way.
Im so glad I didn t watch this.
hey melanie  check out tom macdonald s music video  sheeple
how is it you are here  I took the bus.oh  its why are you here  ummm  the bus brought me.
how does she know there siegel but didn t know that the south lands haven t had a king fort a thousand years even the south landers where like our king is here no one was like do we have a king Imean the elf s been there for a while they never was like is there a proper king we can install
the dogs barking were more entertaining than this show
lol  she wasnt there just drawing him because thats what she wanted to do  I guess you dont know what visage means. the other numenorian leader dude was like yo.. im picking the 10 best of you to draw his face for his tomb  or memorial grave whatever  so use ur time wisely. thats essentially what he said summed up lol. he said capture his visage  wich would mean capture his face in this scenario  it can also be used to describe a drawing depiction of a town or a landscape setting.
house of the dragon is really good! you should be watching that instead.
amazon should pay you to do the commentary.
s e h r a u n
please just end these harfoots  dagger thrown  - thank you!
I love the tick
12 38 lmfaooooooo
you didn t mention the ridiculous song at the end credits
the tv show was so bad that I couldn t even watch this video because it plays in the background
Imust ve missed the  what happened last week  when the blinded queen was at the bow of the boat  Imust ve fallen asleep    watching  where she was going or the scenery ! I want to know why the trio of seers or sauron fannies could find this dude within all of middle earth but they didn t know he wasn t sauron  !! !  are you kidding me!!what a pile of trash this finale and the only thing good was it was the last one for the season  and for me the end of the series .
melanie should recap every bad show and movie from now on
02 45 hey  watch with the objectification!
it wasn t that bad  c mon now.
oh nooo  my eyes! im blind! im blind!
I guess that makes sense as to why conveniently isildur s faux sister just happened to be with the king so he could give her the warning. but still  why was it her of all characters who he ended up giving the warning to  its just plot contrivance so she has something to do.
it was such a hard watch that I stopped the video player the instant I saw credits  so I didn t even hear the song
all im watching is. ...hmmm...okay....that noise  maybe toilken   scrambling in his grave
I so unhappy that jeff bezos ruined lotr.
ugh. men.  lol
Imean. the entire series has nothing to do with tolkien or even lotr franchise. its basically their own alternative spin off that isnt related to middle earth. it is probably why the series is named rings of power even thou the entire season 1 isnt related to the rings.
it absolutely sucked! they tried too hard with galadriel  didnt try at all with celebrimbor and they twisted the character of sauron into something he s not.

throw 1 billion dollars into a dumpster  pour gasoline  light it up... results  a spectacular dumpster fire!
anyone who says women cant be funny needs to watch ths video.
spoooon!
and nothing of value was lost.
this show is written by 12 year olds.  its abysmal
the worse parts in the whole show were galadriel and the hobbits  neither of then connected with the audience at all.
Im glad youre watching this bs so I dont have to.
sauron is pretty hot. glad Im not the only one to think so!
because netflix did it now everyone makes seasons 10 episodes long best way to stand out from your competition  copy them exactly.
actors have no spirit and talent for this tv series. thats a shame. age of movie its all past. r. .p
sweet shirt
it was a dumpster fire with tolkien s name on it.
1 billion well spent
they did it. they are succesful. watch it the elf sh treesome  s now ava lable on stream. hold the l ne  ts tottaly garbage dude.
what are you doing to those dogs
1 10 -
all this talk about  precious  makes me wish this was focused on golem instead of galadriel.
it didn t  but okay.
he is gandalf but they dont have the rights to his name so he s the stranger. nazgals really  we all knew hallbrand was sauron and they ripped the speech off from the fellowship. they made 3 elf rings in 3 minutes. show sucked to high hell.
men having fun ! how dare they !
its over finally
thats why I prefer house of the dragon  the witcher n the wheel of time
the girl spent her hour drawing because thats what all the artist had was 1 hour. I dunno I get it the show isn t as good as the movies but its not that bad  I dont know why ppl are hating on it  I think its just a trend at this point to hate on it  Imean its a decent show  I d have liked to see less woke stuff but its not that bad  if you know the source material they are following it fairly close I guess. I wasn t gonna watch the show due to youtubers hating on it  my dad was watching itso I decided to watch and its been ok.
amazon should have stuck with selling shit on the internet
17 days til       halloween
just keep swimming swimming swimming
spoon!
oh the writing is so bad in this show! it amazes me really.
Ive seen so many people praise it on tiktok I suppose I shouldn t be surprised given the usual content on tiktok
men having fun !   how dare they.   lmao
Im not sauron  Im good . ah yes....just how tolkien would have written it.most pathetic tv show ever produced.
why do I watch this crap show when your review is better.
romance kat
love you
how dare these pieces of crap try to show  nazgul !  nazgul were the ancient kings of men  not chicka chicka slim lady !!!also  how the hell did muriel know where to walk and stand without and verbal queues whenever she is totally blind !
the acting by the dwellers was next level bad  the leader acted like they were in a lady gaga music video
I think he s saruman and not gandalf
still better than she-hulk
I was so excited for this show  and about 90  of it was trash. so disappointing
pet brawl
I know now why you cry they ruined ghostbusters - meh the originals were great but not really to the point of being untouchable if we re being honest with ourselvesthey ruined star wars - that kind of hurts but did you see the prequels  star wars was already well and truly dead they just horribly failed to revive it rather than killing itthey ruined marvel - Imean what can even be said about phase 4 now this... who was so disconnected from reality that they greenlit this  who the hell read these scripts and said   yeah this ll be awesome!  no one  nobody actually thought to quality check anything but the visuals did they
I guess you have to do something to justify all these subscriptions. may as well make reviews of how horrible they are. I got hbo max but mainly my parents watch my subscription more than I do. titans is pretty decent  but outside of that these shows are .
wow Ive never seen so many people crying like babies for the amazon series gandalf appeared in the 2nd age on another name before he was known in the 3rd age
she-hulk and trop have to be trying to make women look like idiots. there s no other explanation.
wait  that eminen dude was a woman  bouhahahahaha !!!
I knew who sauron was without watching a minute of this series. thats how terrible this show is. lol
man  just cancel the show already
just dont watch it if u dont lije the show fr..I start dropping she hulk on ep 3 fr
why is everyone whispering in this show  if I actually did watch this show   I d probably have to watch it with closed captions  talking so no one can hear you does not make it more artistic.
how is it that you are here
so both she hulk and cringe of power are over   good riddance
its not only poorly written. its poorly acted as well. dont even get me started on the cgI and the laughable sword play.
I watched episode 1  and it was one of the worst things I have ever seen. no exaggeration.I cant imagine how much worse the following episodes are.
so glad its over..
you want a better story that this but it actually talks about me he the origin story of the rings  shadow of middle earth and shadow of war  both good games  kinda batman arkham asylum and knighy styled in both games. damn its a better story than this shit amazon put out
sorry  but I cant even watch a minute of this show even to make fun of it.
you expect to trust your review when you made the decision to have those unsightly tattoos  no thanks
what a cluster flop  maybe it will get canceled before next season. nice job mel.
being an amazon subscriber... this shit is so disappointing.
dude the fucking slow scene with a man almost crying telling the woman character just how amazing and how they saved them and made them better.. makes me fucking puke. there is a time and place for that  and its not every 3rd scene my guy.also has there been a single woman having one of those scenes towards a man  of course not.
tax scam
I am glad I will never see this blasphemy.
what is with all of the whispering in this crap  dont they want people to understand the dialogue
great the rei-lo idiots probably all fainting over a possible souron and guyladriel love fest
first sadly my flight is boarding and I cant watch yet
the magic sound effects where dumb that whistle sound was the dumbest sound effects Ive ever heard and it was out of place.
so... this is the thing  according to the contract rights amazon cant contradict the lore of the others ip  but because there s ringwraits before the creation of the one ring this means the nazgul have now a different history also propouse thus the contract has been violated... yeez I wonder what the ones  protecting  the rights will do now...
waitso it was a womans fault hahahahahahaha  if not for galadriel sauron would probably be dead and aaaaaaaaall those people that died in aaaaaaaall those years sauron was alive was the fault of the  feminist star  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
it really sucks!
started watching her because she is hot  but I kinda stayed for the commentary  a bit right wingy  american patriotic for me but still very fun to hear.
do you hate everything
also all the  defenders  claim  noooo  thats no nazgul...
sauron is some pretty boy and not an 8 foot tall boss lame. fanfic trash
just so disappointed what a waste of my time!
I hope u know  if u criticise the rings of power ur a far right mysogynist!
gees  this is sooo horrible....  Im good ...
even the acting is terrible. no redeeming qualities what so ever.
damn girl  nothing makes u happy or leaves you satisfies.  I would hate to be your man boyfriend. wait I feel I should also say girl girlfriend or u might get all inclusive on me
I hope they cancel the second season  this is a piece of shite
dont be so afraid  little girl.
Im glad I didn t watch it. looks boring.
get a job
this crap so bad having lotr film fest just got the ten second opening line from cate wow ten seconds with no visuals at all better then all eight hours of this horse crap amazon made
if you dont like the rings of power then you are an ankle-head!
your acting is better than in this show so....be afraid for casting!this show is disgrace and nothing to even compare to middle-earth.
why was poppy russian  your   review  was like listening to nails on a chalkboard....dont like it  dont watch it
this recap was more annoying than the she hulk finale
this show is so subpar and substanceless  that makes your complete substanceless review of it almost poetically ironic.still thumbs down on both
I think you need to stop crying. I thought it was decent. everyone has an opinion thought and me personally  think youre all cry babies. get over it
worst reviw ever if you dont like the show dont watch it easy but  you choose to make jokes around the series just to make a content and trying to complain wbout everything while you should learn how to enjoy a show even its different from the book am a fan of the books but im enjoying the show and I hate many things but still im enjoying my time but many people like you trying to complaing about everything and you as a youtiber you just try to make jokes for your content and thats not good reviwing should be honest
