Im so excited for this movie I love westerns and gina carano is amazing.
run  hide  fight  was excellent and was daily wire studios first movie. I have not seen  shut in  yet their second film but it has a 98  on rotten tomatoes from audience and so far perfect rating from critics even. their third film that will be released this spring looks hilarious  it is a spoof of super hero and disney films. this western looks great with gina. amazing how good a quality of movies you can make when you just try to make something entertaining rather than shoving ideology into everything in a movie. love westerns  glad they are making a comeback with stuff like yellowstone and 1883.
carano is  by some miracle fluke  a legit fighter  movie star gorgeous  and a decent actress. she has the potential to be on par with action leads like vin diesel  dwayne johnson  jason statham  etc. she could play gritty and gutsy and kickass in a believable way that very few actresses could. a rare talent that comes along once in a generation. its a disgrace that the industry turned on her like it did.  I wish her the best for the upcoming movie.
Im an old school westerns fan  my fave western is the rifleman  and I will be watching this. never knew who she was until disney effed up  but Im definitely hyped for her.
gina rocks! and what the daily wire is doing is very important.bringing reason and sanity back into entertainment!
let s go gina!!! cant wait for june 9th.
queen gina s return ! I cant wait until we get more main stream movies produced by new non-woke studios.
I didn t hear about this movie until today. I cant wait to see it. gina is awesome. donald cowboy cerrone is in this movie too.
cant wait to see this! gina is awesome!
the people involved are awesome and it looks very good. very gritty. production quality looks great  writing should be great as well. looking forward to it!
it looked really cool. sure  im used to tarantino westerns  and it doesnt reavh that level. but it was close. cant wait to see it. also  tdw should just buy the terminator franchise. make a terminator movie with gina being the terminator villain. it would blow the mids of the sjws because they think we hated dark fate because it had women in it when that is not true. so them seeing us praise a female terminator  and it being gina  being the bad ass thatshe is  it would not only skyrocket  but blow the minds of people who wanted terminator to be woke. it has female empowerment  without actually making men worthless and taking the femininity away from the women.
not a big western fan  but gonna have to check this out regardless on principle. really  hope this does great. keep up the awesomeness.
it looks good! cant wait to see it!
awesome! gina carano is amazing. love this trailer and cant wait to see this movie too.
loved nick searcy in justified. exited to see him and gina in action.
after seeing shut in and this trailer  I d want the daily wire to adapt any of my novels into a movie. my first book is written  and Im working on editing it. Im also writing my second book now  but it would be awesome to see them adapt one of my books or stories.  dailywire  thedailywire  benshapiro
I dont know if anyone s posted this before but I really wish melanie would get in to voice acting.she s got a super unique voice that I feel would go really well with anime and video game characters. could literally listen to her all day.
I got chills! the trailer looks great!
lets gooooo! Im looking forward to seeing how this will go. I want to give these new places a chance and hey worst case  I dont like it but I highly doubt that will be the case.
if you like the female empowerment  you should check out the daily wire s other two films  run fight hide and shut in.
I grew up on johnny cash and sergio leone. I love this trailer so much just for the general vibes I get from it. reminds me a lot of unforgiven.
I love a good western  they have a timeless quality to them  really looking forward to this too!
let s not forget about rust
shut in was awesome!!
@joe kaz  indie films are killing it!
though 1883 is very woke-cringey house on the prairie revisionist crap.
nice  gotta check em out.
@cordy one  the most recent episode of 1883 sucked bad the february 6th one  first few I thought were great. I saw nothing woke until the last episode really and I have a very low tolerance for woke.
yep..shut in is about a battered women getting abused and now this gina carono western about a battered raped woman..yeah dailywire seems to have a pattern here lol... the super hero spoof looks good from the trailer but its probably going to be trash writing and hey maybe they might include a battered beaten women in it
and unlike dwayne johnson  she has a spine.
@mike carson  nice revision of history there  carano wasn t a legitimate fighter because she badly lost a match. as far as Im aware  she participated in eight official ufc bouts. she may not go down in history for her fighting prowess  but she wasn t playing around either. these were real fights  getting slaughtered in the ring only proves she took real risks with her body.also  its yet to be decided if she ruined her career by expressing opinions counter to the woke orthodoxy. even so  some things are more important than career. if she sees a problem with left-think and goes along with it anyway  pronouns in bio  nod and smile  etc - she s compromised her integrity. her success would be hollow and bitter to her. I believe she ll ultimately be rewarded for her courage and forthrightness.
@nubbinthemonkey  actually gina carono was expressing  maga woke culture or  maga woke orthodoxy like you like to say.   and real fighters go out on there shield not curl up in a ball after 12 seconds from fighting another woman.    her reward  ..go ask rosanne what was her reward for being  maga woke    what she did was courage  ..courage would have been swallowing your pride and admit you made a mistake comparing your life to jews in nazI germany   what was next comparing her life to black slaves in the 1800 s     and she made a lot of other ugly tweets.  she was literally begging to come back to disney   so dont think this depressing western or disney   she would chose  this...to play a battered rape victim in a depressing western that I almost feel asleep watching the trailer of. lol  yep..this is a big step up.
@mike carson  your posts get more and more inaccurate.   comparing your life to jews in nazI germany  - that is not at all the message of the meme she shared that you are referring to. where did you get the idea she ever begged to come back to disney  itseems pretty clear that disney was shaken by the backlashed and were begging her to come back.  the put her action figures back on the shelf  reinstated her bear grylls episode and even promoted her for an emmy.  she may come back to star wars because they have clearly left the door opened.... but if you follow her at all you d know she is having a blast making her latest movies and may not want to come back if lucasfilm continues to be the dysfunctional weirdo company it is.
@jim72068  o.k yep youre right I just re-watch the fight and it was worse then I thought. she got maul  other then cyborg lifting gina up twice from a take are those the knock downs you are talking about   then sir you are liar.   7 fights was her whole career from people I never even heard and if it talks like a trump supporter and say the same ignorant stuff as a trump supporter then she is a trump supporter.   gina was never taken serious as a fighter like I said.
watch some of her mma fights from the the 2000 s. she was a world champion.
@mr. joe dirt  I should get back into mma  I only watched the ufc for a few years  way back when forest griffin and gsp were in   Imiss watching it.
@mike carson  you cant even name the  head guy  and and I cant looks it up because you seem to be making it up.  why would anything else you post be taken seriously   believe me the daily wire is being run by very smart people who understand the metrics involved.  they will not lose money on movies they invest in making.  the trailer give no details on the plot ... only very basic info.  you have no idea what her character will be doing.... to make assumptions based on a 1 minute trailer is beyond ignorant.. and you clearly dont have the mental capacity to figure out what the message of the meme she shared actually meant but thats ok everyone else has.  d  fired her and lost subscribers. dw hired and and gained subscribers. gc will be in some very good movies soon.  gina won. the daily wire won. disney lost... and they know it.
....nobody is going to watch this movie. another depressing western lol.. but I guess gina carono playing a abused and raped frontier woman is better then her playing a high level bounty hunter woman on disney     ..nope.  its not.
@eyes of ascension  wtf   turning children into transgender   thatsome paranoid stuff wow...I ll put money on nobody wanting to watch another depressing western  hell they got another billy the kid western coming out right now.  just got to say its a long fall for gina carano from not getting to star in her own series playing a kick ass bounty hunter hero to now playing a abused rape victim in another depressing western movie. lol  I almost feel asleep watching the trailer haha!!!
@eyes of ascension  the mandalorian had several episodes without gina and was still great. odd huh   and its not like gina was this great actress with a lot of range. she is literally replaceable.  ask your kid or any kid if they had a choice would they want to see this boring depressing western or a disney   series lol..
@mike carson  like the quality of the role depends on the fictionals characters status on the  who beats who  scale. dont you see that what makes a good role is more about the quality of the character as personality  backstory  how good is the script in general  if there is a good story to tell... really  nothing
daily wire is now putting out a new movie just about every quarter this year.

will do  thank you!  d
it looks so cinematic  and ginas so beautiful and elegant  like an real movie star. looks awesome
wow that looks like a suspenseful western  and gina carano is awesome  I said roughly the same thing on drunk 3po s video as well and I stand behind my statement.
gina is awesome! love her! Im excited for this movie!
your energy is contagious.  also. love gina!
I love your figurine collection in the background!  I cant wait to see the movie.
I got goosebumps!cant wait to see that movie
very much looking forward to terror on the prairie. gina is awesome. my 23 and 6 year old daughters love gina!!!
you need to go watch the other movies by the daily wire. both are awesome! there is run  hide  fight and the newest which just premiered a couple days ago called shut in. both star strong female leads and are definitely worth the watch! enjoying your content! keep the vids coming!
right on melonmac! we need to support each other as alternatives to evil  woke  culture. every dollar we give to people who hate us  is stupid. oh  and I enjoyed  shut in . its a good film. I cant wait for  terror on the prairie  -- also  hyperions  looks rad.
looks awesome! obviously theres a lot of love for gina but there s also a based nyc comedian named tyler fischer in this movie and I highly recommend his self named youtube channel. you can also find an interview of him with chrissie mayr  another based nyc comedian  on her self named yt.
I love gina and I will watch anything she is in
the color and cinematography looks beautful and that trailer looks intense. if I liked that type of movie I d be excited to see it. its too bad all of daily wire s movies so far are scary movies. I get enough just from the news.
gina is so awesome! super excited for this film. Im sure the ideological types will try and say its a  colonizers film
Im soooo looking forward to this film!
gina is going to blow any other woke movie this summer.  hollyweird is going to get big mad!!!
its good to see a believable strong female character in an original screenplay. I see absolutely nothing objectionable with this. I plan on watching this  and Im sure my wife will love it as well. I cannot wait to see what the wokie crowd has to say about this. thanks for all of the content!  if God can be before us  who shall be against us
this does look really good. a lot of westerns lately have been horrible. plus the story seems worth the watch.
she was in another western themed movie but it was post apocalyptic. it was pretty good.
gina is amazing and her will to fight against the hate is inspiring. I am not a huge western fan but my dad is and we will likely end up watching this if only because its gina. that being said  since you didn t end with a scripture let me toss one in here   d. 2 tim 3 12  therefore  do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you  as though something strange were happening to you.  but rejoice insofar as you share Christ s sufferings  that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.  if you are insulted for the name of Christ  you are blessed  because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you one other that I think fits well. we are told in john 15 19   if you were of the world  the world would love you as its own  but because you are not of the world  but I chose you out of the world  therefore the world hates you.
I love gina carano  cant wait to see this movie.

yesss!
ooh what was it called  I love westerns! will watch!
damn that actually looks like a really good western! this is a real dark western I like it  unlike the last big western movie recently  wow I almost fell asleep watching that one..
I cant wait to watch it.
yes melonie has another video twicein 1 day awesome.her movie looks tobe really good I ll see it.thank you for sharing this your awesome melonie
the ending gave me chills
this channel s really getting some traction. good going mel
came here from the quartering s video. praying you have all the success in the world with your channel. also  gina is great too!
woman power is awesome.. when its within the realm of possibility  and makes sense. this makes sense. women who lived in the west were strong  badasses who had to hold down the fort while their husbands were away rounding up their cattle or working the land. they had to protect their family when the man wasn t around. this makes sense and looks amazinf
I am stoked for this movie
Im not a movie watcher  but this interests me and Im interested in supporting alternatives to wokeywood.
this is what s going to finish off hollywood
just seeing that blue mountain vista you can see the quality cinematography. I like the movie trailers that dont spoil and give good atmosphere.
this looks like a comeback story
I hear what youre saying and agree with supporting projects like this but in my opinion we aren t the outcasts they just want us to believe we are
alright gina!  she s pure grit  exactly the woman for the role. the movie is absolutely brilliant looking
much love   for gina carano
I like gina and the characters she play. she is a really good actress.this movie looks like it will be good.just hope it gets released on a streaming service I already pay for at some point. not looking to subscribe to the daily wire news streaming service just to watch one movie.if they release it on a blu-ray before some other streaming service then Imy just buy it that way to see it.
I like the short vids- each video should be length dictated by what its about - this was perfect - keep it up melonie- God bless
I love westerns and gina.  looking forward to this movie.
literally they are just making human-focused low cg films  which is such a breath of fresh air. and in the thriller genre  which is always welcome.
I hope this movie and gina does well  then they can make more independent movies  bypassing hollywood
yup! we gotta stop supporting hollywood s wokie crap and put our money on the good stuff like this instead
reminds me a little of the vibe of  old man henry  which was a solid 7-8 10 gritty western  obviously I hope this is as good. lets go gina and truck frudou.
she s such a good actor.
I am sure this filming of the movies is well done. this feels like a western horror  movie. where allot of people are going to get bloody up and bad thing happening. not my kind of movie but I am sure allot of people are going to love this flick!
looks like a movie clint eastwood might have done late in his career  same vibe as something like unforgiven. should be worth a watch at the very least.
that looks awesome. gina is amazing
looks cool.  like a good old fashioned western.
looks so awesome  let s go gino.
hopefully in the future  we will see a blossoming film industry outside of california.
gina is amazing. congrats to her and the daily wire. I came over because of t.he quartering. not disappointed mm
the name terror on the prairie  sounds kinda hilarious. but I will watch this movie to see her annihilate the baddies!
gotta watch more of these daily wire movies.
I watched this on the quartering s live stream  it looks good. this one seems shorter  maybe Im wrong. edit  no  its the same trailer.
watching this reminds me of the  angelina s savage secret  scene from romancing the stone.
this might be my new favorite gina movie next to haywire.
yes.  ur reaction made me happy.
this looks really good
I said   let s gooo!  the same time you did. get out of my head melonie.
looks like a good flick.
I hope its good  been a while since Ive seen a western.
love gina
you are very very funny!
heard it is real gritty co-producer was the producer of bone tomahawk with kurt russell
bahaha great minds think alike!
@melonie mac go boom  we sure do. lol.
we gotta start carry on judging with our wallets. if its woke garbage  ignore it and use your hard earned money on content  movies and series and games etc  that put more passion into their craft and less woke agenda virtue signaling. gina carano is  imo  one of the best actresses of the current  generation  of actresses and frankly having that talent shoved under a rug because of her own personal beliefs is b.s plain and simple. this looks damn good and me and my family will be enjoying it when it releases!
I would have preferred to see her in a martial arts film  as it means she can showcase her fighting talent. but a western works fine.
real talk  Im definitely interested.
daily wire low key puts out bangers.
wow trailer looked great
let s make gina the biggest superstar in the usa. let s goooo!!
happy to see gina working  but Im more stoked to see cowboy cerone.
heard about you from jeremy. subbed. love your content.
I haven t seen a movie in a theater since the original star wars movie came out.  there s a lot of crap movies out there.  people seem to have forgotten how to tell stories.  most people  if you took away their computerized special effects  there wouldn t be a reason for them to make a movie.  thats one thing that makes westerns so special because its about how we interact with each other.  this is going to be a good movie.
looks dope
yeah - that looks dope
love ya for standing and not kneeling to the mob. God bless you.
oooooh yea! two videos in one day  Im spoiled.
look great  you should do a critique on the various tomb raider movies.
ginacaranoistherealdeal
looks like a good one to me. I would spend money on that.
speaking of podcasts  a bunch of people have been shouting you out to elijah shaffer and sydney watson to get you on their show
I searched for gina carabo trailer and you showed up quite high in the result... you look like her too!!
what an amazing woman. gina is pretty good also.
I liked her in c c red alert 3
ahhh that is so exciting! the algorithm likes me!
gina is a Goddess. there  I said it.as tim pool puts it  this is how you win the culture war  you produce the culture that represents you.
for the budget they will of had to work with  it looks good.
3 13 I just notice you have a lot of lara croft action figures on your table back there
howdy dropped in via suggestion from the quartering s channel to check out your content and I decided I ll stick around because your content seems cool keep it up!
iike youre chanel and the content you do keep up the good work and you will reach 50k subs in no time.
I d like to see melonie mac join forces with geeks   gamers
crankin out these videos I cant keep up
I dont like westerns but the quality of that looked really really good.
that looks
brining back westerns!! and gina!Im sold
will not simp... will not simp... dang melonie is amazing!... nooooo!
still better gun safety on set then rust too soon
go  gina!
I was expecting some production of a level of ben shapiro s show  with him narrating parts of it. but no. they make real movies  regardless of what we think of them  they just make movies they want to make  like itshould be done
love gina carano
while I think gina could ve been more tactful with what she said  itshould not have cost her her job  a simple apology would ve sufficed.if you didn t realize when it happened thatshe was fired for her political views and not for a tweet  itshould be abundantly clear after whoopie goldberg got a slap on the wrist for her objectively worse comment.
this one turned out waaaaaaay better than rust.
watch  shut in  just came out also from dailywire
non-agenda driven content. its refreshing.
wokewashrd!! I love that!
thank you so much  I cant wait
will do!
big fan of period films and gina! how strange the idiots at disney would fire a lady who embodies the very qualities they supposedly espouse for women
excited myself. we dont get good westerns that often and a strong non woke female lead.
I love your long vids
it does look good.
omg two uploads ! !
it looks sick
two uploads! melonie mac go boom boom!
checking out your channel after the quartering shouted you out.
I bet gina didn t  accidentally  shoot two people on set.
based melonie  3
here from he who should not be named to send love from the other side subbed
independent media ftw
I like the shorties. quick vids are good...
here to support free speech. hope youre well
if you like this watch 1883. not bad.
has that hateful eight wide screen look
here from the quartering supporting you  -
melonie that picture of you on your new youtube channel you should make that into a tee shirt or poster or mug
hey melonie I am a silent subscriber for years  I dont watch your content constantly but I do like your openness  be free and dont give into the woke crowd do you girl  and dnk more people should be like that  or like asmongold zack   he doesnt give a fuck.btw I love tomb raider too
terror on the prairie    is that code for something ..
yesss
gotta love westerns that dont take the traditional path.
jeremy sent me

what you loss  has gained you more....
love
gina could be ginny bond. the right moves  sex appeal  bad assesery and sveltness to pull of a female bond archetype.
jeremy brought me here.

marrrrrrrry meeeeee
20-30 minutes does not a  really long video  make.at least for people who follow slightly offensive  timcast irl or jocko willink s podcasts. lol.
Im happy for gina carano back to do her acting stuff. but  much like joe rogan  anything to do with the daily wire is a hard pass for me. sorry.
woman power   lol...
if a woke person hollywood likes made this movie it d be at the 2023 oscar s its a strong woman period piece kicking male ass this would be gobbled up by hollywood
I hate to be debbie downer  but this didn t look different than anything in hollywood.  same with the movie with carey elwes  and it is trying to be classic disney.  they scream nihilism.
gina carano embodies white power more like
this looks terrible.
join the best gina carano group on facebook  its called we love cara dune
