they simply couldn t use the new lara for the logo cause she wouldn t be as recognizable translated to a simple linear drawing like that  people would associate it with katnis from hunger games or kate bishop or someone else with a bow. which is very telling of how much they tarnished lara s identity and recognizability.
see  even as someone that prefers a slimmer body type  I actually agree with mel that lara needs to be lara. it ain t about my taste. lara has a fanbase that her creators need to stay loyal to. not some sjws that want her to look  more realistic . she had a look that fit her story in her universe. it was never broke. never needed  fixing . let lara be lara.
its definitely a bait. I honestly cant trust crystal dynamics but I ll be surprised if she ll look great in the next game.
classic lara and reboot laura  yes  laura  are two different characters  not just in looks but also in personality. no amount of unifying is gonna make anyone believe weeping laura becomes classic lara at any point. thats reason enough to drop the  unified lara
you are passionate about lara croft  not obsessed.also you only get a few great passions in your life  so definitely  fight  for your passion
loving the look of both melonie and lara in this video. I think this will be the best format going forward for your vids. glad to see you back!
I like thatshe is dual wielding desert eagles which btw are hand cannons.
great to see an unscripted video from you again. would love to see you cover the classic games  or really any topic that gets you this animated.
yes please review the classic trs! I wish cd would go back and re do the angel of darkness trilogy that never happened  or atleast go back to the classic lara look and gameplay style .
I would love it if you did new reviews of all the tomb raider games. I love here what you have to say.
in the next game in the series  I think it would be cool if they introduced a path to take either the bow or dual pistols. pleasing both old and newer players. also the next game I think should take place in egypt  lots of curses and mythology  but most importantly a setting to wear those shorts!
lara croft even has some sprites in final fantasy brave exvius and if you wanna see her in a more anime style she also did a collaboration with war of the visions  ffbe and the art for her in that game is really good.
thats a good look on you lol also I like this style better than the other simply because you can put more of your personality in your delivery. good to see you back mel
yeah! I d defo love to see game reviews retrospectives with balanced views on everything. would be cool
hey mel  I would love to see you do a review of lara croft and tomb raider through the ages. all the media. from the games  to movies to comics. I think you d do an amazing job. esp in what makes lara as iconic as she is.
mike s art looks awesome.  melonie  speaking of mikes  did you ever buy any of the topcow tomb raider comics  drawn by the late michael turner. such a cool dude  gone too soon. loved the cross overs with witchblade. he and j. scott campbell are some of my favorite artists  j.scott is pretty based too. thanks for sharing this info.
a tomb raider retrospective review would be great. btw glad that your back!
consider me carefully excited. I love classic lara  she was such a badass!
would love to see in-depth reviews from you on all the games!
I d love to see reviews of the classic games. maybe even some of the later ones as well.
good point!
this in a nutshell. not only would a silhuette of nu-lara not be recognizable as lara croft  I think it would be more likely to be misidentified as natahan drake or chris redfield.
Imean look at the sales of the last 3 tomb raider games and then look at the sales of bayonetta.
indeed
there s no way that it isn t bait  they will only double down. because thats all they ever do is double down.
I actually dont trust most game companies anymore  anyway.
count me in here guys. I will only believe it when the actual game is released  wont even belive in pre-release content  this is how much I trust them!btw. my interest in the next tomb raider game has been watered-down so much by crystals over those years that I honestly dont get even excited that much when I hear anything regarding new game... hell I d probably be extremely happy if we could get at least legend anniversary lara model in the next game but considering cdynamics  and the world we live in just now  even those expectations are at the miracle level
there s also legend lara whose backstory contradicts classic lara s
...she s obsessed. lol
thank you so much  rai
well I cantell you  pistols are definitely more useful than a bow when dinosaurs are charging.
please not egypt again. its a great location for a tomb raider game but its been featured in two games already.
@onsokumaru  I like how in the first tomb raider movie lara address not wanting to go to egypt again. since she was their twice already in tr1 and 4
most ppl will never be pleased  so its good to think outside the box
@onsokumaru  yeah I think spain would ve been great instead of egypt
have 3 variant covers of the crossover signed by michael. miss him so much.
@Lord flashheart  so cool  Im sad I never got  to meet michael  though I did meet j.scott back in the mid 90 s.
@chad crypto  wicked. love his style!
no offense but I never liked lara croft comics. at first it was great to have a comic with a great heroine but looking back all of the arstyles  and that ugly af blonde guy from the comics are just... eh. sad to say because I  3 comics but tr games better to me
@seahawkerino  hey  art is subjective. its all good!
@seahawkerino  the comics went into more detail with lara and also gave her dual pistols a meaningful backstory. I do respect your opinion though you aren t a fan but they did in my opinion do a good job bringing more to the character
@ladylaracroft96  what I didn t like about comics aside from the artstyles is those romances kisses  the fact how they made mlle carvier bitter in this  aod comic dilogy   the comic version is simplified aod and lara meets kurtis probably    I dont remember  from the start  plus its funny how people say that kurtis from aod is ugly yet chase from the comics looks so off but maybe its just an artstyle thing.edit  oh wait  chase used lara s money and was a p--n consumer just to lose it all in a casino plus his leg proportions in the bed scene  lmao what is this. not a good idea but yeah  kurtis is apparently the worst one  ob my God
@chad crypto  it was just illogical as the fact that chase was literally cheating and using lara at times and overly being inredeemable   no redemption arc d help him  yet for some bizzare reasons the comic lara was still with him spoilerbut when he dies lara suddenly feels sad ! and people still say kurtis is the worst  total nonsense
would love to see individual reviews for the classic tr games!
yes! we need classic lara back!
I think their best shot at lara s body design was with legend. legend lara looks more like a modern take on classic lara. anything after this just went downhill. Im sorry but underworld lara s proportions just looked off to me  I got a sense that they were trying to model her after a real person which imo didn t fit the character of lara.
the fact you cantell its lara just by the shadow  says they did the design good and right.
hey melonie welcome back. Imiss watching your videos every day and hope you had a wonderful and great weekend with your brother and with your nephew. anyway I just want to say that I can not wait to see what laura croft looks like in this new video game from crystal dynamics company. anyway I really hope she looks like the old game laura croft and not new laura croft from 2013 video game era. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to tell you that it was great to see you back in this new melonie mac go boom video for today and I hope to watch more of your videos in coming weeks and weekends ahead  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
and they got gex and soul reaver in there. maybe this ll get them on the right track. also  welcome back  mel!
classic looked like she had the muscle tone to do what she was portrayed as doing thats just my assessment plus a soul reaver was awesome
I would absolutely love for you to do in-depth reviews and play throughs of the tr games!
so happy to see you back!! Imiss watching you every day!
I would definitely love to see youreview the series
this feels like marketing research. gauging the potential sales of a redone classic lara.
it could be for possible remastered collections  I can see thq nordic doing that first  especially with gex and legacy of kain. same for lara  this might have more to do with some legacy collection than next game.
from the 30th anniversary logo compared to the fan art it looks like that lara s back is turned and its more of an over the shoulder type of pose.
tks mel  for this news its a pleasure to see your videos you do a fantastic works I hope the next tomb will be true when you smile your eyes show your heart
heck yeah! nice to see raziel in there! been a fan of tomb raider and legacy of kain for over 20 years.
what s your opinion on the legend timeline lara then  in the community many people seem to think underworld would be a  perfect blend  of classic and new lara.
here s the reason I canthink of. she has a recognizable outline like mario kirby sailor moon. the newer design wh not so much. love your look
I d watch more lara reviews!
Im playing tomb raider anniversary on pc. great game. a great representation of the original classic. would enjoy watching a playthrough of it by you. hear your thoughts
I would enjoy seeing a playthrough of the classic tomb raiders games!
I addressed this in my last video you left a comment on  perhaps you missed that part
@melonie mac go boom  what if they combine the classic lara croft with the modern lara find a middle ground to make everyone happy
Imentioned in my other video before this  anniversary is like playskool tomb raider. babied down for the casuals lol
@melonie mac go boom  ha! yes  I see in tomb raider legend lara can kick. thats hard-core. next game after I go through preschool with anniversary
I do prefer the reboots over the older games  main reason being that they feel closer to being like the uncharted games and I like uncharted more than tomb raider. was never huge on the older tomb raider games although I did play them occasionally. I also like the reboot lara croft but not for any woke reasons. I do believe  however  that changing characters because of woke reasons is wrong. too many games are being changed or censored because of the woke crowd and companies catering to their bs. I play a lot of anime games and some of my favorite fighters are doa and tekken and even those have been either censored or had stuff completely removed.
I hope it is a teaser for classic lara to comeback
it d be cool to see you stream the tomb raider games. go for it.
its a good sign at the very least. they could ve just used their reboot model with the bow but instead went for this more classic look. nice.
I love lara croft  but Im more interested in finally getting a gex sequel after  gex 3  deep cover gecko  in 1999... although gex was hilariously anti-pc back in the day  so I have no idea if crystal dynamics can still make a good version 23 years later.
yes! please do go over tomb raider  I picked up a ps1 a few months ago to play it all over again over og hardware. cant wait to finally dive in again!
if you watched any of my videos where I talk about laura croft...  so that narrows it down to about 90  of the videos.
classic lara definitely has some marilyn monroe inspired proportions. nothing wrong with looking like that and being a kick-ass and powerful woman.
hey! funny if you know perrI nemiroff. she s also a tomboy  has a cat that looks like yours  enjoys kickass female characters  and male ones too  and is willing to be friends with ppl with different points of view. she herself is on the left tho. just noticing the similarities
thank you for the update mel!!!
all of lara s thighs and hip are going to chun-lI in sf6 lolI get what youre saying  they are giving her a sort of heroin chic hip... cd is intentionally screwing with lara s design  as  she cant be  thicc  if she s not fat  or  she can be pleasing to the eye but she has to be as androgynous as possible ... that must be their rationale.
these days  with literally anything  I ll only believe it when I see it. from games to movies to whatever.
hImelonie welcome back! good to see you on your channel  I know you ve made the round on other channels.
old school laura never skipped leg day
I wouldn t be surprised if this was a bait and switch. if they come out with a lara croft thats more or less androgynous and anti-female then I doubt the response from gamers will be positive. if this is accurate then its a step in the right direction considering how the gaming industry has been trending. personally I would have given her speedskater quads because I think women with muscular quads look hot.
reviews of the classic tomb raider games sounds great!
Im still waiting for netflix to drop the announced lara croft series  it was long time ago and I haven t heard anything about itsince.. I think they said itshould come out in 2022
lara was the whole package. looks  smarts and attitude.
potential tomb raider remasters or remakes hinted at  same for gex an soul reaver
I have to agree with those saying this is bait. I think even if cd want to go back to classic lara  they wont because of the backlash. cd are in too deep with all this woke bs. I will be really really surprised if they prove me wrong infact I hope they do. as for the classic tr reviews  do it. I d love to see that.
mmhm.
I think we ll at least see some ports for the switch  but remasters would be nice.
@dying rose  embracer will likely have one of its studios port over those ps3 enhanced ports for tomb raider aniversary  tomb raider legend and tomb raider underworld to newer systems. they were pretty good enhanced ports bar fps in a few sections. hopefully underworld will include the dlc that 360 got.
sadly. legend lara wasn t even like classic lara  she searched artifacts for her parents  abused excalibur power in bolivia redux level  let s be real  classic lara was just doing what she wants and never used artifact power like that  and in-game she was talking with zip and alister nonstop  God I hated that england level
I only the played the first couple tomb raiders but loved them. never got into the later tomb raider stuff cause it didn t seem like tomb raider. if they bring classic lara back Im in  if nothing else just for the nostalgia.
melonie  Ive fallen in love with you from simpcast     . know zero about video games   but I guess my knowledge will increase watching you. cheers!
with the barbie doll  there isn t a problem to give her a shorts  bigger lips  fuller breast  higher heels  tight clothes or whatever. even the jlo doll got bigger thighs and bottom  so...most of the dolls are for children  smaller kids. some of the dolls are for adult collectors  but we can only try to imagine how many of them will be a part of children s collection after. meaning that I really dont know where is the problem about proportions and clothes of lara croft  the game is for older people  or even for adults and why there are that ridiculous things  like a sexualism  seriously  really  I think that lara could be a great character for a cartoon movie  for a real action  for a more mature game  or a game for children  or even as a series of a toys like an adventurer in a type of disney character. we got revisioned  there were a few different sides of lara  but everytime she was matches with her style  heritage  her style of life  and she is elastic  but she is herself  definitely the same. and look at warrior mulan  who took the bath as nude with her compans  she had a weapons and whatever what she wore  she was herself as well. let to lara to be herself too  with her true foundation  classic legacy  like the many other characters  kratos  nathan drake  joel  esteban with his team from the mysterious city of gold or mickey mouse. lara can developing  or will getting a fuller character  she can wear many of styles  but she is enough adult and complete to know how she is  what she likes and what describes her and even if she will change her point of view it will be a next part of her life  but it will be still about her  not about alternative variation of someone similar to her.
the silhouette reminds me of a lara croft render done by kat unsworth.
hoping its not bait. I think the art is great regardless...so much better than the unification statue
Im moreso waiting for the remasters of the earlier games on switch. unfortunately I sold my xbox so I likely wont be getting the new game any time soon. but hopefully the game turns out to be good. the franchise needs a win to move forward.
I like the new one though literally  my favorite version
it would never happened because its crystal dynamics but imagine gina as lara s model
when the hell are we going back to egypt and also hearing her say  aha  every time I pick up a relic
will it be a reboot of the laracroft game like the temple of fire fire but with gex and kain and you be able to take control of other charactuers from this games like enemies and bosses
I do! do all the games!as someone that takes fitness seriously the more you workout your legs  if done correctly  your bum bum will get a shape.
received notification....oh..another lara croft video....
raziel or more retro lara  Im here for either of them. hopefully both. never cared about gex.
not holding my breath to be honest... great video!
omg its its gex. gex is the official mascot of crystal dynamics. look it may not look much but gex sequel and fallowing sequel had large maps to explore unlike crash on the ps1. to this day itstill bothers me why they stop making gex. no the game did not flop. maybe if they make gex 4. they have him in one stage like a tomb  as gex dress as indiana jones  or dress as lara croft on a gex game stage. Im glad crystal dynamic show the trinity. those three games are the brand that made them. I think it was wrong of them to put legacy of kain in a back seat. specially gex. gex is the mascot.
you are an american paradox honey.  I love the ribbon in your hair!
its a commission I bet  the ue5 demo by epic already showed us the new lara.
they definitely sound like they didn t pay that artist   thats so fucked if its the case
hair looks great with that bow!!
hImel absolutely love your hair girl! my the Lord bless you and keep you!
lol that wasn t lara
hey melonie is back!
I doubt they re trying to hint at a new more classic lara. I think they just know if they had put reboot lara s silhouette it would not have had any character or been recognizable. classic lara is more iconic always and they know it. in my opinion  thats all I think they re doing.
looking really nice
its surprising that they gave her the original physique no matter how  sexist  it is these days according to them... hope the graphic artist doesnt get fired.
well that was good  she s more attractive than ever. also  lara s okay too. thats how you do that gents.
crystal dynamics introducing the world s first transwoman tomb raider   lawrence larra croft!
am I the only one who wants classic lara look  uncharted jumping climbing and max payne 3 shooting mechanics
lol have you internet historians story storymode video on the reboot game  I think you d love it lol
if this does turn out to be the next lara design  I will say that at least its a step in the right direction rather than more dumpy reboot lara.
I hope we get a classic tomb raider collection some day especially on the switch. its my favorite game series next to zelda so its a dream to play them on the switch. btw  new subscriber and I like your content and just recently followed you on instagram.
Imiss the verse of the day.
wait  is that a soul reaver character to the left !
I think lara s thighs may have been thickest in anniversary. when she knocked larson out with a roundhouse kick itseemed very believable as a result.
do the reviews!
looks like across between chun lI and camay from street fighter in block form holding the tomb raider pose  I wouldn t trust it.
Imust say your work is paying off. your looking beautiful and healthy!!
you should see chun lI from street fighter
Im looking forward to the tomb raider gamebut damn  that logo is baiting me for a new gex and legacy of kain title.
I dont trust cd anymore. they just use classic lara in posters and concepts. nothing more. I am.against this unified tineline and they need to just forget the reboot and go back to the roots of the game.
yeesssssssss please review all the games!
I think you need to refresh your memory. her legs were very thin in anniversary lol. not as strong as in the older games  or guardian of light.
@melonie mac go boom  on the intro trailer she had a lot of muscle definition. less so in the game itself  though.
lara s eyes are still wrong. what I remember most about classic lara are those sexy eyes.
melonie  happy belated independence day!
cant think of lara crofr without having angelina jolie prime on my mind. anything else is a knockoff wanna beedit   and the man did the character justice. amazing artwork and got her looks on point and very inspired from the original
I could not care less if she has huge breasts  shape is more important than suze to me   but yeah having more mass in her lower body and a  stronger  look is probably a good thing.
I dont think we are never going back to old school lara... this is a bait for sure...
maybe we re finally pushing through the influence of heroin chic. personally  I like strong women with healthy curves. one of the reasons I like to watch the uswnt  in addition to being phenomenal athletes and the best in the world at their game  is eye candy.
youre having a good hair day  I see.  d
still love your voice
I am now switched to open world games. cd only does croft as closed world linear.closed world linear is no longer in my interest group.
keep em  comin   mel
they should make the next tomb raider more open ended like fallout 4   skyrim.
lara croft will be played by billy porter.
they should give next lara a semi-realistic design  making her curvy  quite feminine  but not taking it to the extremes.also restore lara s bustiness. I hate how game developers now view busty women as if they re inferior or something. thats actual body shaming.
we can only hope laura will look as feminine as her silloete.
well  thats something. I still have hopes that they will bring classica lara back and hope they would not combine reboot lara and the classic
there s nothing wrong with wanting game characters to look good  they re not real and this is all escapism.guys always love big muscular characters and you dont see anyone telling devs that they need to be toned down lol.doom slayer  master chief  kratos etc. are all examples of big characters  and every one of them have actually gotten bigger over the years as oppose to getting smaller.its just strange to me that devs think that it is offensive for a character to look good if they re female  can women not have good looking characters to look up to as well
yes rate them!!!!
the only time I care about how characters in video games look is when I play on my playstation  when I play games on my pc I dont care because I can customize the games by downloading fan made skins and textures and thus find the characters I like  download them  install them and play with those. when I played tomb raider on my pc I just downloaded a good looking lara croft and played the game using that  and the game was stable  I think it only crashed once or twice.
even fortnite has classic lara in the shorts.
I dont always agree with everything you say  especially about the tomb raider franchise overall  but I do always find your content entertaining  so thank you for that.
could be.. woudn t be surprised.
heroin chic was never in video gamewtf are you talking about
@andrea corrales  perhaps learn to think more broadly. and its not necessary to shout.
@bear  xd
and you dont keep coming
no  itshould be more level based like in the classic games. having open worlds just means that the pacing will be all over the place  tr4 is good example of why open ended level design is bad and shouldn t ever be bought back again.
I dont know. calling thatsilhouette  curvy  seems like a bit of an exaggeration to me. cd had her look about right with underworld lara.thatsaid  thanks for the update. until there is a new game that definitely fails to deliver power fantasy lara  there s still hope of having a proper tomb raider.
hImelonie I know Im late with mycomment anyway.I just wanted say uhad done another fabulous video.takecare melonie
one thing I did like about the rebooted lara croft was that her breasts weren t gigantic. it just looked silly. no way she d be raiding tombs for long when those back problems kick in. lol
so I take it the recent film wasn t to your taste
I just hope they disregard the canon of the recent reboot games. I just...disliked everything about them from a visual and lore perspective. no longer was lara raiding tombs for fun  knowledge and profit  but she was a rather whiny college student who seemed to resent her own wealth and nobility.  I d also much prefer going back to the original look. so as much as the piece of art was really well done  I want them to disregard all aspects of reboot lara  even visually. even the necklace would be too much for me. honestly I d be more than happy with the look from tomb raider anniversary  given a fresh coat of paint.
they d sell more games if they made lara curvy and thick  sadly they d rather promote some social justice message instead and made her genderless with no real womanly qualities.
classic tr games reviews from mel   where can I sign up
they always use classic lara look in their logos. they not fooling me again
its going to be woke.
Im predicting a fort nite style look. I they re gonna go full zoomie cartoon mode
no verse of the day
that certainly looks now more like lara croft. is it bait  maybe. . . speaking of bait. . . .someone - or something - tried to spam reply comment. . . . .
she brought the thicc.
thick thighs save lives.
melonie
tomb raider has passed from hand to hand and that always hurts because they want to do other things  I really liked that lara of that time but that time has passed we are in 2022 where everything is more real and serious I really like the new lara there are things that I did not like that they did not give it much action and more deadly traps and suspense but it was already good in a very beautiful design what they had done and what they still need is to correct and add their things that made it great and famous but not restarting that cock every time I feel offended as a fan of the saga itseems disrespectful!
there s no way. feel like they re just using an asset from the top down games.
and the situation isn t only about lara. for example one the classic and regular disney character has never gotten the tittle of the official princess even if she is the princess as well. its about kida  and arguments are really cheap. someone said thatshe is overseuxual  even if pocahontas and moana also have a very incomplete costumes  and to dont talking about ariel  who has only her bra when she is in the mermaid form. also was argument tha the movie atlantis was a big flop  but sleeping beauty was a flop too at the first. another argument that kida is the queen  not princess anymore  but elsa from frozen is the queen too and she is among the princess more or less official. so if you dont like somebody  then probably you always find an argument  and maybe with lara is the same  maybe someone really dont like her or has never liked and try to change her to fix to a canon. so someone can fit to the canon of the official princess like mulan  who were never a princess and has never become in any versions of the animations and she can be in a man s outfit  take a bath as a nude girl  be a fighting warrior  and stays always as chinese  not africanamerica version of herself. but another person like kida doesnt have that big space and she doesnt fit to the princess canon. if lara didn t fit to imagination of someone with his subiective vision of her  better was to change lara  right  and next to add to her all the arguments...
she carries  boulders.
hello melonie  someone is posing as you to scam
I hear you  but to be honest  tomb raider ain t exactly built on realism.
cant agree more!
I actually really liked the first one of the new trilogy  but the other two didnt go in a direction I liked gameplay storywise. she should have progressed to the lara we know  got her dual pistols etc
well we all know how the activists want the common folk to feel about rich people.. supposedly they re all thieves. now in lara croft s case  that happens to be somewhat true due to her profession. but thats the point. she isn t supposed to be this all-benevolent figure. we re not playing tomb raider because lara is a philanthropist! lol
@sephy980  thats totally fair  and I think most people were willing to give it a chance  Imean lara rebelling against her upbringing wasn t a bad start so long as progression was handled well  and the annoying side characters were bearable for a game. but itseemed like the following games just kept the same tone  which really put a dagger in the heart of the interest of classic fans. Imean lets be honest  would they have continued using classic lara for say  those twinstick shooters and the mobile games if they felt reboot lara was working out  she just didn t have the appeal.
@dying rose  exactly.
I d say the odds are 70  full blown woke   20  slightly woke   10  no woke for the fans   franchise
then I d be done  lol.
where s my Bible verse ! lol
the artist has some problems with the anatomy. the arm from the left doesnt look normal. there should be an angle  between arm and forearm.
where you been girl !
I would say the jaw is a little off .
raziel
no more Bible verse of the day
every single franchise trying to appeal to 2 different audiences is failing  and or already done. halo  cod  gears of war  star wars  mortal kombat  assassins creed  battlefield  etc.if they try to put a smidge of reboot lara in a new game they d already be wasting everyones time and money.
if they make lara croft ugly then Im not buying it. I dont care if thats shallow  Im just tired of sjws demonizing beauty because they re ass ugly and want everything to be as disgusting to look at as they are.
I smell somethin . I smell subterfuge
true americans are cool happy red white blue month
where s the Bible verse
second
first
u need to worry bout having kids and raising a family instead of larry crofts  having hips  too damn old
but didn t crystal sell lara and the ip off  so they dont have the rights to lara anymore
I just got an email from supposedly melonie saying that I have been selected for a prize . I am not sure that I buy that I do not frequent this channel . I have watched some of her videos and I love them but I do not watch them often enough to win a prize . I am not saying that I do not want a prize I am just saying that I do not buy it. so if anyone knows anything about this please let me know what you come up with . I got the email saying to email her back on telegram but when I type in the address on telegram there is nobody named melonie mac go boom . there is a melonie mak .
took a break to refocus on content direction and recoup from burnout  but I am back
no  square did. so the new people that own lara are the new bosses for crystal. if that makes sense  correct me if Im wrong
square enix sold crystal dynamics  eidos montreal  and their ip s off to embracer group. new publisher  same devs
@melonie mac go boom  ah okay!
@ee-co  makes sense
I do not email people about giveaways. unless I announce it on my main channels it is not really me
yeah its a fake melonie mac. got it too. used melonie mac logo and all....scammer...
