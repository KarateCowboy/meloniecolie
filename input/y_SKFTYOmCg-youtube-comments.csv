as a conservative Imust say that I absolutely adore my libertarian brothers and sisters.  my prayers go out to aunt norma.
thoughts and prayers to your aunt.
as a proud gun-toting libertarian  I can gladly say that our memes are the dankest
let me educate you.  no words have brought more irrational urges to do violence than this.
wishing your aunt a smooth recovery! good vibes for you and your fam!
Ive needed a good laugh at stupidity today this was greatly appreciated. prayers to your family and aunt. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
my prayers go to your aunt norma  and the entire family  during this difficult time.  healingmercies
I came initially because jeremy pointed me here.  the man s got your back   I stayed because you are immensely entertaining. completely grounded   speak a lot of sense..but youre live reactions are utterly priceless... plus youre part irish.. which is always a bonus.so...  erin go bragh thoughts are with your aunt..
its called the  motte and bailey  fallacy. the motte is the bait  the bailey is what they really want to push. ex.  motte   safe spaces for people of color  bailey  actual segregation. they love to use a noble shield to hide behind so whenever you criticize them  they can make you look like an absolute hitler.  why are you against bipoc only safe spaces  you racist  check your white privilege!  if anything sounds horrible if you put  jew    black  or  trans  instead of  white  and  male   then its racist and or sexist. period. there s no 2 ways to go about it. either its or isn t  its an absolute. the fact that  wokies  cant see that while they virtue signal in the same breath is astonishing. thats why I also yote my ass out of any  social justice  label and activism  its pure  unadulterated hypocrisy. keep going  mel. youre doing good.
you ve mentioned several times how these people cant stand others having different opinions and it drives them mad. the original  classical definition of  bigotry  is  an obstinate or intolerant devotion to one s own beliefs or opinions . they re just bigots  and we should point that out loudly and often so as to discredit them in the eyes of their followers and the public at large.also  subscribed to your rumble. look forward to watching.
I ll be praying for your aunt! my aunt also is going through some cancer problems so I get it. a thought I had about the far leftovers  is they re so diverse they have no real unity. I hope we can reach their common sense soon. there s a lot of nice people with good intentions over there.
my thoughts and prayers to your aunt too  melonie.  I hope her prognosis is good and that her doctors caught it early.  best to you  your aunt and your family.
praying for you and yours  especially your aunt!
melonie  I will be sending some good vibes her way! as someone who was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2016  and 2 surgeries later  I am here in 2022 despite the median amount of time you have left being 12-18 months. that diagnosis changes everything. especially for people like me in the early 30s of my life. I have turned it into a positive by creating a podcast to share everything Ive learned and reaching out to people  volunteering with the american brain tumor association where I will be speaking at an event on march 5th  and being active in brain cancer support groups all over! looking at me now  you would never even know because my hair covers the scar and everything. also  more memes.
mel  your day ones love you. we re always going to be here for you. we know you are  we love who you are.
oh man  the condescension and fake concern are the most annoying bullying tactics. sorry to hear about your aunt. hope she gets better and your family is comforted during this time.
I have been your friend for many years  melonie. I have never told you to be silent about anything. I have always supported you through everything including before you got married and even after your divorce  I have always told you like I have told all my friends. speak up  dont just sit there and say nothing. opinions are like ass holes  everyone has one. if someone dont like how youreally are  then  tell them to move along cause there are those of us out there willing to accept you no matter what  without fear of judgement for what you have to say.also  I am keep you  your aunt and the rest of your family in my thoughts and prayers. hopefully all will turn out well. you probably wont ever read this on air. but  that is okay. I just wanted to let you know to take care of yourself  my old friend and always remember that no matter what you do or say  I will always be your friend and I will always have your back.  may God s love  wisdom and guidance be with you on all your journeys  always.
this was fun! hope you do more different variety of things like this in the future
I hope everything goes well with your aunt.  cancer is a terrible thing. I lost my mom to cancet in september.  it has been the worst experience in my life not having my mom anymore.  not hearing her voice on the other end of the phone is heartbreaking.   or getting to see her.
I am over joyed at how far you have come! God bless you melonie!
bless you
libertarian is another name for conservative. because libertarian views are always conservative.
@thearchmystical  not always. see abortion.
@thearchmystical  monetary polices are very similar  otherwise no.
@thearchmystical  yeah but we aren t as gay as conservatives.
I d like to add my own thoughts and prayers to yours. so now its doubled.
I still die laughing from the boogaloo side quest memes.
buuutt who s gon build da roads  bruh!!
facts
what he said
jdb libertarians are not far left or democrat im a libertarianim not far left or even democrat.
thats kinda creepy and cringy
in retrospect  putting those two  entirely separate  thoughts in one post may sound disingenuous. not my intent.
she hasn t mentioned her irl relationships on this channel  at least  and may not want that kind of stuff publicized.
thoughts and prayers for your aunt. my sister recently had surgery and stuff for boob cancer and its fortunately looking good  hopefully aunt mac has positive results too
never been a huge hopes and prayers person but I hope the best for your aunt.
the real ones gotta stick together  real recognizes real and at this point there are so much fakes that its easy to find and stay with a real one like yourself. prayers out to you  your aunt  and your family    psalm 55 22
my sincere condolences. I hope you and yours pull through as best as possible.
thoughts and prayers to your aunt  hope she makes a full recovery.
this is a long one...I can relate to your experiance when it comes to not having friends anymore. or at least finding out they were not really your friends to begin with. sinds april 2020 I knew when the whole c-o-v-i-d stuff began I knew it was bogus   because I do my research  and from that time I was loud and gave my friends on fb every fact or study I could give them to give them the change to inform themselfs. in 2 years I went from 206 to 141 friends.  most of them went quietly  no fuss no remarks. even family members ditched me  ignored me and called me a little child  Im a grown ass female of 43...not even close to a child. I stand with my  opinions and believes  but it is hard knowing the truth and being treated like an outcast. my last living grandmother died last year and I didn t go bc of the damn face diapers that I refuse to ware. but a niece of mine told that my grandfather   her late husband  had to hide in ww iI otherwise he would be send to german workcamps. nobody of my family knew that and that made me more determined to speak up. he didn t hide so that I would give up my freedoms. I owe him my life  if he didn t hide I probebly wouldn t be here. so I try to keep faith and pray  but I dont have the energy anymore for people that turned their back on me  they made their choice. that was my rant...I will pray for your aunt and wil light a candle for her and may God help her recover this.
this was awesome! you should do more of this kind of thing  -  I thought it actually helped lighten the mood.
can I just comment on how pleasant your laugh is  melonie
petition for melonie to make a  go boom  subreddit  good spot to suggest articles stories and she does regular videos of her reacting to memes talking back to her fans.yes its just like pewds  but the format is solid and melonie can easily make it her own.
love the outfit  melonie mac go boom. awwww sorry about that  melonie mac. also yes be positive and praying for your aunt
I hope your aunt gets to feeling better.and keep the spicy memes coming!!!
got you girl prayers going to you family. may she have a full recovery.
praying for your aunt.I can see why trudeau did the emergency act. those bouncy houses can be dangerous in the summer time just think about them in the winter time when snow and ice can make them slippery.
prayers going out to your aunt and the rest of your family
sorry to hear about your aunt darlin. hopin for the best  stay strong  big hugs  love ya
I hope your aunt pulls through and dont worry you have a lot of friends out here
youre my favorite new youtube channel. thank you for being a breath of fresh air on here. I never miss a video.
thoughts and prayers for your aunt.
just subscribed but Im already in love with your channel! praying for your aunt!
melonie mac go uh uuh uuuhhh uhhhhh boooooom goes the dynamite. I hope your aunt is okay. both my parents were diagnosed with different cancers in the same year in 2018  and thankfully they were both able to have them dealt with fairly cleanly  though my dad had to have a kidney removed. I started growing my hair out to donate to cancer wigs so its crazy long and down to my waist now! was meant to donate it in 2020 but covid... so its literally an extra 2 years of growth on top of the length it got to already by then. everyone always gushed over how strong and thick and soft my hair was  so I hope it makes someone or someones some very nice wigs. Im thinking of donating to child cancer wigs  as they can make more with it then  but still waiting for the  weather to warm up a bit first. Im not a religious person but I ll send positive thoughts.
keep at it melonie  we have your back  and best wishes for your aunt.
I hope everything goes well for your aunt!on one of the comments shown in the video  Im a little confused about the aloy being a mary sue thing.  hzd is my favorite game probably  disclaimer  but if she s a mary sue then she is.Im just a little puzzled on how she falls into that category because I went through the campaign in my head  and the only thing that I can see she qualifies is because she s the playable character so she has to be able to beat everything.she s essentially a clone of sobek as a failsafe if shit hits the fan so that the hardware can be accessed  so I didn t think it was that.is it because the story writers didn t really give her anything thatshe has to lose so that its clear she s not invincible or something  basically something to happen thatshe cant stop   which that in and of itself shouldn t be a requirement for something to not be overpowered.Im wondering what your view of the game is that makes her a mary sue because there might be something Im forgetting thats staring me in the face. lol
prayers for your aunt norma while these memes are awesome  and hilariously funny.  I cant find you on rumble or I d definitely follow you there
bring all things to him and wait for pan answer if you want to succeed. I found that the more time I spend focusing on him the better of my life is in general
my thoughts and prayers are with your aunt norma

I have placed your aunt norma in a prayer army so thatshe may be healed and soon in recovery.  thank you for being so positive.
seeing youreact to these is a joy
Ive survived cancer twice so anything is possible. stay positive and my prayers go with you and your family.
the person that questions what you would wear has a dark issue inside them.my condolences for your departed.
love what youre doing here. hopefully you are part of the catalyst of a great movement. america has turned there eyes from God and I do believe the only way through this is to turn to God and realize where real strength and help comes from.
I will be praying for your aunt. God bless you  melonie.
mac  your laugh is infectious!
praying for a full recovery for your aunt norma.
praying for your aunt and hope she gets better
I hope the best for your aunt norma. I bet she one tough cookie.
finding out who your friends are is like an enema. not very pleasant but it does clear all the crap out of your life
my mom was also recently diagnosed with cervical cancer while recovering from a surgery. luckily they say its contained and they seem to expect a positive outcome but we can all use some prayers! prayers to your aunt and my mom!
Im sorry to hear that melonieGod watch over you and your family
maybe Im a meme snob  but a screenshot of a tweet thread isn t really a meme. thatsaid  they re still funny to watch you crack up reading  _   all the best to your aunt and your family in this trying time!
back to back going in!prayers for your aunt norma.
thoughts and prayers for  your aunt.
you dont have to explain yourself and why outfits aren t changed etc.  you do you and take care of the real world.
I like this segment. you should make it a regular
I used to watch you a lot back when I was heavily into gaming. then I got real busy. nice to see your name pop up when I was watching one of the quartering s videos! see you ve went the same way as me -- pushed out by all the woke shitheads. I left what I was doing because I refused to teach   mentor people bullshit. I just refuse to do that!interestingly enough  my entire business is in crypto now  and I ll say wholeheartedly that crypto is almost impenetrable by wokey s. mainly because its funds   investments  and its so much harder to convince someone to do something or act in a certain way when its their own money. I could also get behind the idea that it was started by government  but then I doubt they understood the positive impact it would have long term.crypto is pure ownership. people cant say we ll stop paying you if you dont spread our lies. it just doesnt work like that!
thoughts and prayers to your aunt norma.
prayers for your aunt. take care.
mel  you can sleep soundly at night knowing we got your 6. I ll hit up the other socials as well  no way Im letting someone in my good content gang slip away and not reach me.
it is refreshing to see God working in so many lives lately. someone I have been friends with for over 20 years is getting baptized this sunday  and I am loving it. I will be praying for your aunt.
these libertarians are frickin  hilarious with those memes  yet made me think.  great meme showcase here.
not religious but best wishes to your aunt from all of us in our household. never give up
1  you must know that people do in fact beat cancer on a regular basis  its not all doom and gloom. stay positive and seek ways to aid your loved ones  sometimes just being around them when they need you is all you have to do.2  some of those burns were so sick I could smell bacon from my monitor.
I hope your aunt gets better.
God bless you  your aunt and your family.
I believe that your aunt is already healed and moving around.  Im a person of faith and I used to be for war until I realized it wasn t getting me what I wanted.  I learned about neville Goddard and sammy ingram . they showed me creation is finished   what I visualize   affirm or imagine hearing is already done . I have a lot of success from what they teach. I show people very easily how to live by faith . with these questions  what do you want or who do want to be  its true to the first answer   so now what do you see   hear or imagine yourself saying   are you thankful   feeling that its already done   who or what are you or who or what do you have  then persistently assume it .
most people dont even realize they re libertarian. once you tell them exactly what it means  they re pretty much on board. edit to say  thats the problem with all the labeling and tribalism- you get caught up in labels based on one issue situation  so you oppose those who probably agree with you on more stuff than whatever tribe sucked you in.
Im not  religious but I  wish all the best for your  aunt
those memes were hilarious! Im following that account now.
I am not a praying man  but positive vibes going your way.
many are the plans in a person s heart  but it is the Lord s purpose that prevails.proverbs 19 21 niv. keep up the great work mel
just realized I wasn t subscribed yet while this channel has been a new daily of mine since jeremy shouted you out  so yeah  just subbed. not a religious one so it wont be a prayer but all my thoughts go to your aunt in the hope thatshe recovers.
any friend of jeremy is a friend of ours  he s a pretty decent judge of character  he s friends with bearing and dankula after all  in fact you should try dropping by his little podcast for some shenanigans.
first  I hope your aunt recovers. also  I was libertarian  before I knew it was a political party  so when I found out  I was like  ahh yes  so thats my party . at first  I was just weird  but nope  turns out Im libertarian  who dont give a fuck about other people s issues  so as long as freedom reigns over america! and do not tread on me! so these memes get me.
positive waves for your and and family  3
Im a quartering follower and I do have your back. really glad I found you.
God bless you  melonie.
right on  lady. good stuff.
Im praying for her  c
praying for your aunt.
oh melonie  I remember watching some of your videos 10 years ago but never subed. then all the sudden jermie tips your channel and now I watch every video you make.stay cool girl
may the Lord be with you and your family in this time of need.
!00  accurate on the crypto.  you will eat bugs. you will live in a pod. you will own nothing  and you will love it.   crypto is literally nothing. be a commodities chad  own something. great show melonie.
prayers to your family
what up chicky!!!! hope your aunt gets better.
light and blessings for your aunt  3333
waking up from woke. sounds like a good book title.
Im praying for your aunt with dealing with cancer.my best friend lost his momfew years ago from cancer she was likea 2nd mother to me so Im praying  for you your family.takecare melonie
yesterday s conspiracy  tomorrow s truth
une prI re pour ta tante
this is one of the funniest videos I have seen in a long time melonie!  trollololol  p.s. - how do you play video games being a woman who s also partially a minority   mind blown  now I know everything about you. I bet I can beat you at barbie super model for the snes tho
absolutely I will pray. God can heal her I totally believe it!
Im a libertarian too . awesome.
praying for your aunt
im glad you found your path....go boom!
my moms name is norma  I ll be praying for your aunt! my family is also going through cancer with my father.
some of those libertarian memes are just savage!!! xd xd xd
11 51 -  let me educate you!  lol
my friend s father just died from cancer sat. night. I dont necessarily pray or anything but Im sending some good energy or whatever to your family. also I think its crazy that 15  years ago I was deriding fox for being so biased partisan in their reporting and now I feel like they re more impartial than cnn or msnbc these days. I dont trust any mainstream news  but it is something to think about.
I just assumed you had a never ending amount of black shirts and pants
immediately starts of with a reason why she s wearing the same outfit twice. girl gunna girl.most of your viewers are male. our typical rotation consists of 2 pairs of jeans and a couple shirts. we aren t judging your wardrobe. also  its a nondescript flat black tank. no one knows if its the same one or not. we would just assume its your  uniform  and that you have tons of them lol.
the g.i. joe episode youre referring to is called  money to burn .as I predicted the new currency is called  cobra currency.
regarding channel growth and alt tech. I bet she still has only 2 followers on rumble meanwhile from yesterday afternoon to late this morning she s gained about 1000 subs.
I am from europe  so no idea who or what these librarians are  but my thoughts go out to your aunt s recovery!
you just got monetised on this channel melonie! dont say that about who runs things  its a question youtube doesnt like! lmao
I started listening to you while I played total war warhammer 3. now every time I hear you I think of that game. yeeeetttt
12 03  now thats the fire of the holy spirit blazing.
8 45 Im putting my money into gold prospecting equipment.  I spend a lot of time searching for spanish treasure in the mysterious and deadly superstition mountains with lara croft.  make sure that youread the mysterious and deadly part in a deep announcer voice with plenty of reverb.
I will pray for your aunt.
I found your channel because of support from the quartering  which is ironic considering jeremy leans towards the agnostic mindset. God uses all things for the greater good. last  so many of these woke people are going to discover that ideology is a lonely road later in life. cheers keep it up.
praying . God bless you malonie
the main issue with growth I see is she doesnt share a rumble link.... only  melonie mac  ref I could find via search on rumble was thequartering s shout out
love these memes.
9 51 they see themselves as moral superiorety
these are fire!!
commenting to feed the algorithm ...  and I ll say a prayer for your aunt.
us greek Gods will pray for your aunt hail the living mortals   !  keep strong
you should add your alt tech accounts to your linktree.
I had three aunts on my dad s side irma  norma  and dora.
my experience with the wokity-woke on twitter exposed me to how much you dont matter to them when you dont support every single thing that they support.  me being afro-american has led to me being seen as hating my own people because I rather authentic character diversity over raceswaps  even though I reject musa s raceswap in netflix s winx and shades  raceswap in netflix s  luke cage   he was afro-latino turned euro-middle eastern descent  .somebody called me  disingenuous  for saying  most diverse superpowered teams take on main villains played by white actors   while talking about netflix s raising dion  all the bad people are white males  .  so  apparently  I should have said most villains are played by non-white actors  and lie to myself to appease them.  they want us to be sloppy like them   all inclusion is smart inclusion  even while execution of inclusion disregards lore and merit of roots.  they say they want bookoo diversity in fantasy worlds but they dont look at wakanda  agrabah nor the avatar korra world.  they re all fictional  they can justify any additional inclusion with  issa fantasy   but they only focused on the euro-centric world of middle earth because they see the most validation in whiteness.   look  we can be in white worlds too ...  or  simply make new worlds and expand on other cultures  folklore.  no   not valid enough   m kay.  I wouldn t change anything about any monoracial world  I love them as is dont care to  I also rather focus on the original fantasy sci-fI world Ive been developing   but if I had to  I wouldn t simply pick middle earth to  reflect the diverse audience .  it was made to represent some of european heritage  just as avatar korra does for asian inuit heritage.  meanwhile  netflix s avatar show is not so diverse but  according to the woke tribe  shouldn t that be a failure
prayers to aunt may
that is simply a lovely Bible verse.
youre the bomb diggity yo!
thatsounds less like them feigning concern and more like that bs move your mom does when she doesnt like something you say or do so she thinks of the worse possible outcome and says she hopes that doesnt happen in the fakest sounding concerning voice.
one of my coworkers bought a  white privilege  card. its a white plastic card thatsays  the white privilege card trumps everything. this card grants its bearer happiness and success because its the color of your skin and not the choices you make that determine your abilities to be successful.
to that mortgage debt meme
just so you know  I looked you up on rumble and its showing that you have no videos. that may be your problem! I d look into your settings to see what the issue is if I were you. I enjoy your content  keep up the good work!
the 0 prepping one is the
they always blame others what they are doing themself
yep trust in God and things always work out   we ll go through hard times and struggle but that makes us stronger   like the good book says   God doesnt help those that dont help themselves or others first.  spread the love f the haters ignore them and things get so less stressful but dont want to toot my own horn but being smart is painful when you see the obvious and others dont but there s a reason why what will happen will happen . Im rambling now just live life lol.
bless you  pray for you
Im an old school conservative myself but I have some libertarian leanings. I want the government out of the lives of the people as much as possible and I believe that the government should submit to the people  not the other way around. a lot of people that believe in traditional conservatism or liberalism hold that as sacred. but today we have this group of radicals who view freedom and individual liberty as some form of fascism and that must be stopped at all costs. their twisted ideas are the very dictionary definition of fascism.
this is why I hesitate getting too deeply involved with politics  religion or other groupings in general. its so black and white to everyone. sounds like youre just trying to stay logical and fair. I do think some people go overboard and are too antI  woke  to the point where they obsess over it. I agree with your take on lotr and  after googling  shades too. he was cringe in thatshow anyway. Im all for diversity and inclusion as long as it makes sense. they could include minority races in shows where it makes sense but they choose the wrong characters for their agenda. I think one great example is spider-man into the spiderverse. they implemented racial changes but itstill makes sense overall. anyway keep doing what youre doing   Im glad there are outliers like you that think for themselves
@darth hylian  exactly.  and thank you.  Im also glad to find others who are logical.
psalm 103 2-3bless the Lord  o my soul and forget none of his benefits who pardons all your iniquities who heals all your diseases praying for you aunt norma
will pray for your aunt
so do not fear  for I am with you  do not be dismayed  for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.    isaiah 41 10 prayer for your aunt. my mother is going through lung cancer for a second time as well so I will pray for your aunt when I pray for my mother    .
I love the daily verses o
micheal knowles says conspiracy theories show that people are thinking. they find connections to two seemingly unrelated things. sure sometimes what they build the theory on is speculation and assumptions and ultimately unknowable at the moment but the connection cant be ruled out. sometimes there are people who are conspiring.
I constantly pray your dearly beloved aunt.
God is always first. also I searched for you on rumble and just got the quartering video on you.
I always find comfort in the Lord  because even though the wims of the world leaders are ever changing. the Lord is the same today as he was yesterday.
for your aunt
best wishes to you and yours  mel.while I found the rest of the memes pretty clever  especially the one about the emergencies act   the one about senator sanders and student debt doesnt work for me as I feel its a misunderstanding of his position. as itstands right now  yes  college is considered a luxury and a privilege due to the monetary incentives involved. however  the senator advocates for education as a right  which is why he pushes for not only student debt relief but also making public colleges tuition free. most people forget  or never knew  such an education used to be free  up until the 1960s. in addition  its important to note sanders does in fact advocate for national rent control  community land trust and untethered housing assistance. this would directly combat the mortgage issue  as a preventative measure to stop a repeat of the sub-prime mortgage and housing crises of 2008-2009.this has nothing to do with a particular political party. like bernie  I am independent. this is also not an uncritical endorsement of the man. I have grown disappointed with him over the last two years or so and wish for him to retire. his ideas will carry on without him  and probably should . regardless  if anyone here has not seen heard it  I highly recommend bernie s appearance on the joe rogan experience  episode 1330. in addition to being an insightful interview  it clears up a lot of misconceptions about him and his positions. thanks for coming to my ted talk.
the thin about cryptocurrency is its being tracked by the government. so you may be more right about the government creating cryptocurrency to create a digital and paperless currency.
my condolences
gold and crypto for me. I only hold enough cash for the basic day to day. everything else is mainly metals and assets  and some crytpo. fiat currency is the only  asset  gauranteed to lose value especially long term. short term its whatever  but short term trading is for people who want gray hair by the time they hit thirty.
there are two sides  their side and everyone else s.
I love anarchical  libertarianism but its pretty much just the best and ideal utopia in that in that it will never happen on a large scale but I still love libertarian community its one of the best!
you picked the weakest memes. Imiss the height of the meme war  when liberty memes mattered. its too hard to find dank memes now.
I felt like that last year to. at times still do. gym work gym shower supper bed repeat. keep myself busy.
crypto is part of the beast system   if you look into it block chain and aI are one and the same.  blockchain is the network through which aI communicates.
thought with you and family and hope yout aunt is getting getter. just a thought might be worth talking to rumble as there is two accounts with your name and a fake account   Ive subscribed you your one
hell yea libertarians!  screw the lp
I swear. I have a little bit of crypto bags but I have still been sus about it for a while now  it could be a psyop
yep I consider myself a libertarian   anarchist  the true meaning and a socialist the moral version which is helping others if you can .
your channel is cool though.
delight yourself in the Lord  and he will give you the desires of your heart.  psalm 37 4while I agree  I do believe that there are desires planted in our hearts by God  Ive always read that as more of a cause and effect statement rather than a promise to give us what we re wanting  so to speak. if we delight ourselves in the Lord  then his desires for us become our desires for ourselves. therefore  granting us the desires of our hearts is not so much God giving us our desires as much as it is us coming into alignment with the purpose and fulfillment that God has predestined for us.
melonie  there are two channels on rumble with your name.
putting God first is to establish an anchor point in your life. putting yourself first  the international church of me  is nice for today  but 10 years from now you will be a different person with different goals  wants  desires. putting others first  staying in line with the most popular social trends  is the worst of all. this can change daily. you have to check the social  weather  every morning to see what your goals  wants  desires should be. God or some other long-term established system of doing good  doesnt change all that much in your lifetime. you can build on a foundation of doing good without worrying that what  good  means will change from day to day.
prayers  for sure!
girl its a black tank top and black pants. you could have 20 different outfits that look identical if they re a black tank top and black pants.
