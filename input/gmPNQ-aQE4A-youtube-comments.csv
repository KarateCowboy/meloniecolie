they say the perfect woman doesnt exist  and they are right.  she doesnt really exist.  she s a video game character.
my issue w  the  unified  lara croft is thatshe looks like a cosplayer. she s the protag  the legend  the face of the franchise  she shouldn t look like a  regular  person. as you mentioned in a previous video  she s a power fantasy. if everyone or anyone can be lara croft  then there s no point in being lara croft.
this is what Ive been saying for years  the fact that lara croft was never trying to be realistic. to me  she was always a cartoonish character! tanktops  shorts  dual guns  lots of bullets lots of adventure and a boatload of charisma. lara croft has an attitude  she s smart  sexy and she knows it!
Im not going to apologize for liking the fact that lara croft is attractive. her sex appeal was part of the character and if these people hate that  as far as Im concerned  thats their problem.
I wish the amount of fan backlash that is currently happening in the lotr community would ve been something we would ve seen in the tr community years ago. the problem now is thatso few people were vocal about how far removed the current lara is from original lara  that the devs seem to just think its okay to continue on in the same way  making the same bad design choices. lara doesnt need a  unification   she needs a  restoration  to who she was originally.
lara croft is more than just a power fantasy. she is a representation of the feminine principle. she is mercurial  chaotic  you ve got a 50 50 chance of her kissing you or shooting you in the face depending on her mood and circumstances  and her look absolutely needs to reflect that.she is not a puppy but a she-wolf  not a kitten but a lioness.beautiful  sexy  fierce  passionate  defiant  intelligent  cunning  sometimes playful and always with an undercurrent of deadly potential  something not quite fully tamed just under that cultured and educated bombshell exterior. in truth if I had to name the one thing that truly scares the character lara  and Im not 100  sure  scare  is the right word here  its love.I think she has a very difficult time dealing with that kind of vulnerability.just my take.
as usual the true fans of a franchise do itso much better than any corporate hollywood executives. true fans know the source material and lore inside and out which allows them to stay true to the original vision. its always the directors or producers who want to  reimagine  a character that they have no personal interest in and they just ruin it.
am blasian  mom is from west africa  dad s pacific islander  both immigrated to usa  and I have never asked for  representation  in anything.  if you want a fair representation of me in video games or movies  then make a protagonist who s a devout Christian and isn t jaded by their faith.  I care way more about that than my skin color.
its a shame that they re trying to replace our strong  badass  charismatic and charming lara with a unrecognizable plain jane neanderthal. its sad that only the fans have to be ones who respect lara better than the developers.
you can always rely on fans to save the day  from those who have become woke and out of touch.
a big problem with  wokies  and the left in general is they dont find double standards and hypocrisy shameful.
its weird to me how warped the definition of righteousness is to these woke people. they ve convinced themselves that they can gain righteousness by screwing other people over. Ive gone through life believing that being righteous is doing my best not to screw people over   even accidentally. I dont always succeed  so I lay no claim to righteousness. but at least I am trying my best.
if people for real take time out of their day to hate on you like that  then that means youre doing something right because for whatever reason people hate it when people are doing good for themselves or are more successful than others.
Im going to be laughing at that winston in the freezer art for hours. that brings back such good memories. also  Im a mixed kid too. mexican and scandinavian primarily. you had it on the money. all my life Ive been told Im  too white  to consider my latina blood legitimate. even though I was raised with my mother s side s latin culture  Im told Im culturally appropriating mexican culture because Im a  white girl who wishes she was mexican.  its always woke people or blood purists that tell me this and it really pisses me off. telling a mixed kid to  pick a culture  or to  pick the culture that matches their skin tone  is telling them to erase part of themself.
a lot of the issues I have with devs is they seemingly love to rip on gamers but who s fault is it when it comes to  what gamers are into   gamers are into an ip because of how they are originally presented to us.
leave it to the fans of lara croft for doing a better job then the developers. lara should be smart  sexy  confident  badass and most of all feminine.
you are so right about everything.  its amazing that those thatsay they support strong female characters  do everything they canto make them look more like men. how does they support women in any way  I dont get it. never will!
I recently started working on lara croft in the sims 4 and I absolutely went with classic lara. as someone who was always taught you had to be boyish to be strong  lara really meant something to me. she s intelligent  she s strong  she s amazing... and she s beautiful  too. have you seen her house  that girl absolutely lives in luxury. she ll go to the opera dressed to the nines and tear open her dress for agility. I honestly haven t give new tomb raider a chance since the whole change just feels like performative feminism. I hope one day we ll see a classic lara revival.
from the very start lara has never been in the hands of a company that has the capacity to treat her right.back then it was eidos who just saw her as a titillating cash cow to be aggresively milked and nothing moreand now its crystal dynamics who seem to have some kind of wierd grudge against the classic iconography of character itself. idk who does deserve to own her but I know it ain t either of the above.
its nuts thatsquare enix can re-imagine tifa lockhart in current age while retaining her iconic look but refuse to bring back lara to a design thats more in line with her iconic aesthetic.
this is the truth
except anyone trying to visit and say hi.   lara is never home!   what the heck is she doing months at a time   I tried looking in a side window  fearing the worst  but all I saw was some mud caked trouser  what looked like a holster   and some wolf pelts   -l. croft s friend
@jeffy p  lol
preaching the truth
I feel that way about meI  after what I saw her go through that would break anyone that woman still as happy to be alive and she s  feminine and dorky and just a ray of sunshine. no watch rise and shine  I was amazed by her inner strength to push on.strength doesnt always mean big beefy muscles and a  tough guy attitude.  Im stick of western cults stripping women of all their feminine charm!
yesss
well that depends how far back you go...... coz the original idea was to make a man with a fedora and a wip... until they realized that they could get in trouble with copyrights of indiana jones.... then the idea was to make it a latina woman called laura cruz.... but ironically they thought that no american could pronounce laura so they went for the more british lara croft  which americans cant pronounce right . its only after tr 1 came out thatshe became an icon.... her chest btw was that big because the one who created her by accident messed up the polygon on screen and the others convinced him to keep it that way.... anyway I dont really have a problem with the reboot as it was refreshing  but I thought it would be more of an origin story working towards the lara we know.... instead they went the other direction with giving her some ridiculous half round masculine abby from tlou2 face in the last iteration... the games though were still fun and we should be glad... coz their original plan with the reboot was to go full woke and make lara a lesbian that had to safe the damsel in destress sam  then got into a relationship with each other.... thank God they didn t go that road coz that would have totally ended the franchise.
@devious   than
@devious  it isn t about what just she wants  it is about what the majority of fans want  and devs will be wise to listen.
couldn t have said it better myself. sad thing is I really like the gameplay of the new games but the protag just seems terribly watered down. and sadly I can apply thatstatement to a lot more than lara croft these days.
exactly. a protagonist is supposed to stand out. not being one of the many.
@stijnvdv2  so your opinion is be thankful for shit with sprinkles when we could of been given just shit  yeah no. yes the reboot games are fun. but they are fun games but not tomb raider games. there is so little of the og tomb raiding and puzzle solving they should of just given her a new name and made it a new ip. if I have a choice between half assed or nothing at all ill take nothing at all.
@devious  the opinion police is here to arrest melonie!
what happens if lara croft s character  journey in tomb raider game from square enix is her beginning journey! the lara croft we all know is a independent bad ass woman figure but here is the real questions  what was she like in the beginning  was she always the bad ass  what was her past like  what was her beginning story or journey to become the tomb raider to me the lara croft character from square enix is the   young  lara croft and her beginning journey story. where Im getting at is from a book I read and the author who is famous   the hero s journey by joseph campbell.  the young lara croft is starting her hero s journey to become the independent bad ass woman we all know. and maybe in the beginning lara croft was a regular person with high aspiring dreams and great ambition. and like the tomb raider game from square enix  her true hero s journey was starting when hitting thatstorm and landed on that japanese island and the other 2 sequels  and done the line her hero s journey will lead her to become   the  bad ass independent woman tomb raider!
@john cipher  we already have a  origin  story for the core designed tomb raider games. they didnt need a rewrite of her characters origins.
@memnarch129  but does her origin story of being highly confident  independent  and headstrong in the beginning make sense  did she have flaws in the beginning  did she had any doubts during her hero s journey  but I wish I could explain to you more but it will be long written essay. but here is something  if you have a character that inspires you and you look up to  do you want to know their flaws and have any doubts during their hero s journey  I do because I know that even if Imade mistakes I am human and my character is human also and she he can grow to be something more and I will be also.
@stijnvdv2  thats not an argument. since supporting any kind of tampering like this opens up the franchise for those worse case scenarios in the future.
@devious  dont body shame people because of your own insecurities. which by calling old lara  not a real person  you absolutely are  because there are  real  women who have even more exaggerated features than her.
@stijnvdv2   the original idea was to make a man with a fedora and a wip  no it wasn t. the developers themselves said that lara was always going to be a woman  that they wanted to appeal to their american audiences at first so they named her lara cruz  then they switched gears and realised that american s love everything british so renamed her lara croft. everything that you have said is myth thats been going around the internet for years but a recent interview  last year I think  with the developer himself said otherwise.
you said it perfectly. its why she can do things no human can do and survive injuries so bad the pinnacle of physical prowess and also be the pinnacle of femininity. it is like doomguy  is every soldier if any capable of fighting off hundreds of monsters and being a human bicep  no obviously  the strongest man today is a wimp compared to him. but he is the male flipside to lara.
actually  some cosplayers are amazingly good.
@peaches and cream  that depends what we mean with  originally . because in the actual original pitch for the game  there was a male character. but while toby gard was working on more characters for the game he came up with female character that he instantly fell for and wanted as the main character.
Ive heard they still want to do that in the next game unfortunately
gotta disagree with you there
basically  wokeism is syndrome  from the incredibles.
@stijnvdv2  crystal dynamics doesnt realize that there are a lot of mexican people in the us then.  lara croft is still cool  but laura cruz might have been even better.
you so fucking nailed the point jean  thank you. thats the whoooooole point of heroes and superheroes  if anyone can be one of these figures  then what s the point and what s there to aspire up to
@john cipher  she was always a bada   since she was young  this was already covered in tomb raider iiI which did go back to her origins.
@stijnvdv2  funny you mention that because the next lara croft reboot actually will have her in a lesbian relationship with an older woman. so yeah  they re going full-on woke with this next game.
word
as jean said lara croft is a power adventure fantasy for girls and women  but also a lust fantasy for boys and men. thats her point. women and girls are supposed to look at her and say I wish I could do that  I wish I was as cool and pretty as she is. while men and boys are supposed to lust after her. the devs have lost the point of this character or any video game character. we dont want to play characters that are us we want our power  adventure  and lust fantasy.
exactly. she is james bond. arnie in commando. a comic book hero. she is a power fantasy  the stereotypical  every man wanted her  every woman wanted to be her . she should never be normal or average.
we peaked at core games
they try and undermine our opinions by focusing on the  male gaze . we can like a character for multiple characteristics  sexy  strong  smart  they are not mutually exclusive.
this.
exactly!
why would you apologize for that
@jubeI yagami  some people think its disgusting liking an attractive female characters
my first crush was nell mcandrew solely because she was the face of lara for a while
@donovan jarvis    those who screech about that most  however  are raging hypocrites.  if that  male gaze  is gay  then they celebrate it like its the greatest thing ever.  at the heart of it  they just despise natural affections  and want all of them replaced with unnatural fascinations.  they want all cases of  be fruitful and multiply   or even anything which may hint of it  replaced with what amounts to being fruitless and divisive.
it makes her also more dangerous because her beauty can deceive her enemies which makes her also just more smart.
@donovan jarvis  the thing is thats not even close to all she was  but it was a part of her. new  lara  isn t even nearly as strong  confident  clever  smart  or charismatic. it might as well be a completely different character.
this!
problem is that the game was not bad in a strict sense. it was probably the most good looking game of that time. had a good gameplay  even if more suited for a war game than an exploration game. people had reasons to like it. plus in the beginning it was supposed to be a young  novice lara croft. a character that was still not hardened by experience and years of adventures. people expected in possible sequels to become more aggressive and hardened. hell  the first game even end with her gunning down the final boss with her trademark dual guns. like a foreshadowing that the lara we knew would come back.but no... woke  flat  archer lara till the end.
the new games feel more like uncharted games.
I forgot tomb raider even existed. the boring new lara is probably the reason why
@b .y. bies!!  yeah this is exactly why I love the 2013 tomb raider game so much  her development and the story kept me glued to the screen. but the two games that followed were just the same thing all over again.
most people tuned out. they thought action would speak more than words
according to her biography the only thing she s truly scared of is corgis.
I couldnt have said it better! as a german fan growing up with that powerhouse of a woman  I was so mindblown by her!.. I even drew fanarts and fancomics as a kid!
well said. also the reason why  back in the day  angelina jolie was pretty much a perfect cast for her  even though the movies were still crap .
@gwenx13 she also screams like any other damsel in distress when she takes a long drop and predicts a short stop.
its like when fans fixed the awful resident evil 3 remake. fixed nemesis  fixed jill.
never going to happen. never ever. not in a nu-western game  or nu-western film  or nu-western tv series. never ever.
Im actually working on a faith based comic book series. many of the characters are Christian. there s racial diversity. cultural diversity. religious diversity. strong female roles  they re attractive by the way . and manly men. one day you ll get your wish. the dream is to make it into a video game series. but one step at a time. Im still developing characters. so if you dont mind  I ll go ahead and make a blasian Christian for ya.
@samekh productions  send me the link when youre done
facts
they deserve medals
thought you said onlyfans until I read that again
boom!
and kinda rely on modders to finish the job
youre the first person you must rely on. relying on fans simps  is useless unless you want emotional worshippers.
its like when fans fixed the awful resident evil 3 remake. fixed nemesis  fixed jill
@the candorist  I really had to snap back and re read it again
only as long as you stick exactly to the ideology. all cults work the same way.
@stephan clemens  exactly. works for them when they do it but not the others.  rules for thee but not for me  energy.
I think you mean  american democratic party   which is full of moderate liberals. Im a democratic socialist  I can stand hypocrisy
@xoruam  you could add 6. always represent your group and act as exuberantly as possible
@max ramos  you can stand it  or did you mean you cant  its seems to me to be all over on the left. bernie sanders for example. so much property and wealth in his hands. marx wouldn t have been proud.
@cuttyflam  well  what I went for is more along the lines of core ideological tenets  rather than rules.its not what  you should do   but rather  this is how the world works . what you are describing kind of falls under point 2 - its just a proof of belonging to the collective. since the collective has decided to fight for x  as long as you are a member of the collective  you are also expected to be vocal about x. if yourefuse to do that  or worse yet  criticize the collective about being vocal about x  it proves that you are not a member of the collective - and considering that our collective is on the side of good and decency  if you are not a member  then you are clearly evil  and as such  you become the enemy. and again - anything done against the enemy is justified by the sole merit of being done for our cause. so as soon as you leave the collective  you can be bullied  beaten  minecrafted - because by leaving our collective  you prove that you are evil. and evil people have no rights.from what Ive noticed  the left really is kind of like a hivemind...
nailed it!
she mostly have guy haters because a lot of them wants to poke her
I feel your pain. to heck with them  they cant tell us what we are when we know the truth.
@melonie mac go boom  absolutely!
@eclipsegst94  cant agree anymore than what you have said. i
just point out that canelo alvarez is more mexicanthen them and that they should get over it.
mexican are spaniards tho not indigenous lol and the spaniards get mad when latinos  all the land we conquered  erase that part of them.
@soysauce  most mexicans are mixed with spanish blood but from a cultural standpoint they are not the same. I can see why latinos across mexico and south america wouldn t want to claim any spanish roots because that was a very  very bloody time in history and the spaniards were the ones shedding the blood. also  just because many of the latino population is mixed with spanish blood does not make them spaniards. they aren t culturally similar  most of them are not dual citizens of spain  and not every latino is mixed with spanish blood. in this day and age  hundreds of years after the conquistadors travelled across latin america  I dont understand why a modern spaniard would be offended that latinos dont always associate with their spanish bloodline. its a whole different continent  its not exactly the latin america of old  and its only natural that they not practice spanish culture when they aren t spanish and they have their own traditions that are still thriving.
Im australian with one side spanish little bit aztec and another side australian english. if I say Im australian people say Im too dark for that  if I say Im spanish people say I dont sound like it. damn people are weird
@zzodysseus zz  okay  two things  spain was part of the atlantic slave trade and what the conquistadors did in latin america absolutely counts as genocide. but that wasn t the point I was making. the point I was trying to make was that latin america and its many cultures may have been influenced by spain but that does not make them spanish. their cultures are unique and diverse across the continent. Im american so this is honestly the first Ive heard of latinos denying spanish heritage. I was more so trying to understand why  after so many years  spaniards would have a problem with latinos not considering themselves spaniards when  by nationality and culture  they re not.
square enix felt the series was getting stale after many years of the same gameplay and plot with just prettier graphics. the reboot from 2013 is actually the company s 2nd best-selling game of all time  behind ff7.as you know  their bread  butter and gravy are rpgs. unless they want to remaster old games  you typically never see an rpg story last for more than 2 games because its only a matter of time before fans get tired of the same story and want something different.
careful darth  youre trying to have your cake and eat it too. there was nothing wrong with og lara. or core design
I love lara croft. as a girl growin up she was my icon. the 90s were goated. she was as iconic as the spice girls. the new lara is bland lifeless and doesnt do anything for herself  she does it for her  father  . Ive shared the same opinion as you ever since the first reboot. I felt she was slowly changing. first with her tech enterage  which she didn t need  but the enix put the nail on the coffin
never apologize to anyone for your opinions. the simps of the twitteraty think they can bully and shame and intimidate people just to make themselves feel important. they are a very small minority of sad angry people who have no real power over you. as far as devs go  they should pay more attention to the real fans rather than the  woke  mob  who have probably never even played the games.btw  really glad to see how fast your channel has been growing. Im glad jeremy brought you to our attention. keep up the good work.
I love this! I feel the same about jill valentine. she s designed to be very feminine while she s kicking zombie behind. and as a woman  I like seeing female characters as being portrayed as beautiful  feminine regardless of what their role is in the game. I hate that gross lazy mohawk or whatever its called or when the female characters look more like men and are lacking in feminine characteristics.
I understand totally how you feel.  growing up captain america was my hero.  I wanted to be cap.  as I got older I appreciated his integrity and steadfast loyalty.  marvel comics has decided to make cap a nazi.  because america bad if course.  wokeness is ironically driving us all together against it.
when you see something you have loved for 2 3 of your life becomes a bastardized mockery of what it once was of course you are going to have some strong feelings about it. the devs are insane to think you should be okay with it.
Imust say  hearing Jesus call out ancient wokies is exhilarating!  I felt like clapping by the end of that chapter!
I think that tribal lara was my favourite. to me it represented all of lara s personality and style in one.also  irish swedish here. dont ever hold back on claiming the irish side. we love it. the irish love it.
I do miss old lara croft designs too  especially those from the legend anniversary underworld era. we need more male and female protagonists in gaming who are unabashed and unashamed power fantasies.
I never thought describing  woke  people as pharisees is absolutely the perfect description of these people. and Im surprised Ive never thought of that as a Christian but it makes complete sense because they are the modern day pharisees. also I totally agree with lara croft I absolutely loved as a kid playing her games in the early 2000 she was so cool and confident and I loved that about her. she was so iconic that I could spot her character a mile away. and funny enough the lara croft movies with angelina jolie are my favorite video game movies of all time. they aren t perfect movies but they got the character of lara croft almost perfectly. I want what id did for doom 2016 reboot  they modernize doom but respect the games and understood what the essence of the games made people love them. and doom 2016 was hugely successful and popular and I want that for lara croft but I dont know if that will ever happen with these pharisee permeating the entertainment industry now. I can only hope
I couldn t even watch the last movie. I couldn t suspend my disbelief that that was supposed to be lara croft enough to get past her first scene. angelina wasn t offended when she was asked to wear padding to more closely resemble the character  she liked the way she looked and gave them notes for the prop used in the sequel. but I guess little miss vikander was just too good for thatsort of thing.
from my experience  less is more . classic lara may have  lacked  more prevalent story story points yet... she is a video game character  the less personal stories she has  the more the player can relate to her. the last time I felt classic lara was from nicobass tomb raider 2 remake project.in term of personality and physicality I always said lara was indiana jones as much as betty page.
wow  seeing these fan-made lara designs makes me realize how badly I wish to see a lara like this in the next game!
this proves once again that the fans will always back a good story or story universe  even when their industry founders fail them.
as a fellow halfbreed tomboy  my existence tends to trigger the woke  lol. we are mythical creatures to them  lol  -p too black to be native  too native to be black  too ny queens kid from the ghetto to be nice  lol. both sides were against me since the day I was born.  -p
agreeing with you completely  melonie.the first stab in lara croft tomb raider s first stab in its gut was hollywood s inclusion of a lost father in the first movie  at least that lara remained lara in her attitude and likes and dislikes. but in the original story  both her parents were alive and well  in fact the croft s and her had antagonistic relationships. mommy and daddy-dearest wanted a proper noble lady  one they might be able to marry off to a  crown- prince to push their own family name higher up the social ladder of britain. lara being lara... well  clash.hollywood s film  needed to  bring in the pathos   and then they extended that even further in the second trilogy  the reboot trilogy  legend-anniversary-underworld  where now her father was lost on an expedition looking for her mother that was also lost on an expedition  which made the whole thing eye-roll worthy. the pathos  people! the pathos! but at least she was still lara  and was raiding tombs.and then came the second reboot   survivor  lara. itstarted out somewhat okay  but by the end of the first game she was reduced to   lara croft - daddy chaser . there is absolutely nothing to this lara croft other than the daddy chasing. she doesnt raid any tombs  except for the non-canon  side content minI tombs  and by the end of this trilogy she found saved her daddy s legacy  defeated his enemies  and oh  yeah  declared that tomb raiding was bad yo   despite not raiding any tombs  and thatshe was into tomb preserving now.of course  the same problem with the second trilogy that is with the third  once the whole reason for your  tomb raiding   the parents chasing is over  what s left to do with her  story is done. this is rather why the original lara didn t have any of that nonsense  she was raiding tombs  as she says in the first opening cinematic of the first game  for sport.  always another tomb to raid  and always more sport to be had.so tomb raider needs a reboot  back to basics a ship  a table  some folks  talking about why they re here  one talks about their family legacy  the next talks about their love for history and uncovering its lost pages  the next talks about how her mother fell off a ruin  and this is cathartic  or something  interspersed we a close up of some boots getting tied  pants getting put on  a shirt pulled on  a belt put on  a knife put in a holster  etc. and finally the group around the table  someone asks our dresser  its lara of course. and why are you here  holding red  round sunglasses lara looks behind  sees no one  jerks back  and asks surprised   what  me   yeah  you.  dont get me wrong  far be it from me to disparage all your interesting reasons to be here  but...  she puts the glasses on  peers over them at her compatriots  and said with a light smirk   Im just here for the lulz. somewhere very early on in the game  possibly the first playable section we play  is a playable flashback. the original s spark that made lara love the raiding  aircraft above mountains  storm  lara 9 10 years old and her mother on it  aircraft crashes  mother barely alive  you make a makeshift stretcher  and off you go  drag your way through some caves  figuring out puzzles to get the stretcher on  surviving on whatever you find  and of course  come across lara s first ruin tomb some ancient site. doesnt even have to be great  something understatement. youreach a village  and we end with headlines   lara croft saves mother.   little girls protects mother and uncovers lost site in the process. and we cut back to the present  where we start some actual tomb raiding. maybe the rest of the team is meticulously uncovering pottery and walls and dusting them off gently  and they find some crevice or gorge  and lara of course  doesnt wait for ropes or anything  she just starts climbing down  and we get to explore our first tomb  preparing way points for the rest of the team  interesting things to uncover and dust off... and then the bad guys arrive...also  cut out the supernatural. I kinda get why they went with it back in the first game  series   and thus got brought back in the subsequent ones  you have primitive graphics  no real way to due real ruins justice  it was in indiana jones  so  great to give the last section of the game some extra pezzas  but I rather feel the game was doing just fine without it  but today  there s plenty of awesome legendary stuff  that isn t actually supernatural  out there in mundane real history to be absolutely awesome and keep all of our attentions. there is one  no need for the supernatural  and two  the real world history makes itso much more interesting. you dont have to literally never stray at all from the real world  of course you can do something interesting and new tombs and such  blended in with real history  but to go all the way to the supernatural  I say dont bother. in fact it rather detracts from the whole concept as far as Im concerned.
revy from black lagoon reminds me so much of classic lara  such a badass. a lot of women from thatseries were so badass.
this is why this unification thing makes me nervous. I want to be excited  but I feel they are gonna mess up her design even more. these designs are just beautiful and much more representative of lara. we can only dream so let s keep classic lara alive people. love ya melonie! keep on spreading the word!
most of them are properly finger-off-trigger too.I think the confidence thing really hits it for me.  I actually enjoyed the reboot as an origins story.  it was fine  maybe expected  for her to be a bitshaky in that context.  but then they decided that the reboot was tomb raider and kept making her the same way.  they even made her a bit unlikeable in the last one.  this is probably why I loved horizon aloy so much in comparison.I also miss some of the classic gameplay.  I still remember finding the lever in venice and having to memorize and perfect the canal route to the exit.  in the new trs its  scan for interactables  determine the proper order of interaction  profit.
hImelonie.  came over from the quartering right at the start of go boom! and have been enjoying it immensely.  as far as lara goes  if you have not had a chance to read any of the top cow comics tomb raider series  early 2000 s   I would highly recommend it.  it does a great job of showing lara as both an attractive woman  and also a bad ass adventuress.  and while I am myself a pagan  I am enjoying your selections of Bible verses.  having spent a lot of time studying different theologies  I can appreciate the lessons laid down in various religious tests.  keep up the great work and Im looking forward to a lot more boom!
first time viewer. very glad to have heard your take on this.your opinions here felt genuine in a time where a lot of people creators tend to just hop on a bandwagon  on either side  in the hopes to make money off of it. often with a deep lack of understanding of the ideology or fandom they claim to represent.keep being true to yourself and I wish you the best   subbed
lara was playful  smart  unwavering confidence  took charge of her own sex appeal  she was headstrong. I cant think of any traits the new lara has.
to me. these new games tell me that in order to be taken seriously as a woman. women have to be masculine in order to be taken seriously
yesss!!!
the irish nationals usually do not love it  especially when an irish american does it. most are bigots in that regard and talk down to  foreigners  that claim irish heritage because they re not  real  irish. that is until that  foreigner  becomes president or wins a sports tournament then suddenly 1 1024th is more than enough to claim them as being representative of ireland  punching above its weight . its honestly disgusting and contributes to my hesitancy in claiming my own heritage because I dont want to associate with such toxic behavior. that being said anyone who has the heritage and wants to claim itshould just ignore such haters  they re not the arbiters of your history.
is everything alright
@criticaldrive7  as well as a hectic  stressful life can be
@jean gentry  Im so sorry to hear that. I certainly hope that things in life will be better for you soon.
@criticaldrive7  thx. I hope so as well.
whoever did these pieces of fan-art should whip up some unwoke versions of the blue check twitter mob s profile pictures lmao. anyway Imostly just lurk follow content like yours so thought I d just say thanks for being such a breath of fresh air  especially within the gaming space. never forget that you speak for the majority who seem to have lost their voice  and dont let the vocal minority break you down.
love this. I absolutely love tomb raider  but I felt more excited to play the games again watching these renditions than I have ever felt seeing the  new  laura. thats what a character design should do  make people excited to play and want to see more. I honestly dont even like the super realistic games. I would rather play something that does look stylized or unrealistic. otherwise it just feels like Im playing a movie  if the plot is good thats fine  but when the plot fails having something unique or pretty to look at is necessary.
your voice matters as much as anyone else s. especially cause youre a big fan of the franchise. opinions and criticisms from true fans is very important. and I respect the quote from the Bible as a Bible reader myself.
awe I saw you get a lil emotional in this video  girl I feel you so so much. I knew this whole time you have been holding back on your true opinions on the new games in the past. so happy you are speaking out and spitin truth. they turned lara into the opposite of so much of what she stood for.
this just goes to show the God complex modern video game developers have got  that we live in a world where they think you are not allowed to criticise them. sometimes I wish another video game industry crash would happen so that these clowns can be brought back down to earth and get a doze of reality. this mentality of  blame the players  that the industry has adopted in recent years needs to stop. if it wasn t for the players these clowns would not be as successful as they are today. these game developers are way too full of themselves  acting like they re out there curing cancer when all they re doing is essentially creating time wasters. the world will go on without video games. these developers need to stop thinking they re God s gift to the earth.
fans know how to do a character justice. you  can see it in the cosplayers and fanart.
I love your post  because I have completely the same opinion on this topic. I used to be a big fan of original games back then and actually  I am still now. people told me I would look like original lara and I feared to cosplay her but you do inspired me to do so. thank you
wow. Im pretty sure this is the 1st video of yours Ive ever seen and I am thoroughly impressed by the breadth of your knowledge. I was not expecting to go from an analysis of lara croft to Bible verses. great analysis all around and I look forward to more!
dont worry   melonie   you aren t actually getting  backlash    youre just hearing the usual small but loud crowd of sjws hating on you like they hate on everything.  its nothing personal   its just what they do   constantly searching for something to be offended by.  the vast majority of real people agree with you.
that is some badass artwork! the first four  especially  bring laura to life. that is the kind of tomb raider Ive been waiting for  for nearly 30 years!
the problem is that there is always someone who is offended for one reason or another and instead of realizing that the offended is a minority and going thanks for your input and moving on they get chandalitis and start walking like they re on egg shells and thin ice in order to appease and wind up gaining nothing and usually losing everything.
I remember thinking  when I first watched your video   wow  is that a lara croft statue   only to slowly start to see the table of other laras  and then you outright stated it.
huge respect  I feel your frustration because Im a huge fan of some characters too  motoko kusanagI  ghost in the shell . I think a lot of people feel the same way. unfortunately devs are probably in it for the money more than the actual fandom. really sad.Im not a huge fan of lara croft but dayum I cant help but absolutely respect the treatment these talented artist gave her. love it.
me  I just want lara to be hot and cool again!!wokesters   ooooo them s fightin  words  rabbit!!
I know exactly how you feel  a lot of the things I like have been changed for the worse and when I voice my opinion  respectfully   the devs couldn t care less and the mob is keen to pounce. it really sucks  but we have to keep our voices up.
6 05 is perfectits the perfect blend of classic lara and reboot lara... actually thats what I thought the reboots where going... that at the the end of the trilogy she would grow up into the lara we all know and love... I like the reboot trilogy but classic lara needs to come back!missed opportunity edit  this one specifically looks exactly like if reboot lara grew up into classic lara.
lara s personality and physique were her favorite traits. she herself  huh.she wanted to train  she did it focused  without worrying. something the new lara is not. the new lara would worry about other issues and become obsessed.the old one doesnt. she just did what she did for fun. and its this strong  focused personality that the new developers seem to get a little confused about.just because she really wants something doesnt mean she has to be toxic to get it. she s just a strong woman who wants a little more adrenaline and fun.
just found your channel today. Ive been a similar fan for decades and feel very similar to you. its really cool to hear a female gamer saying this though since Ive found myself very much in the minority about  classic vs reboot  lara and as a straight male  I sometimes feel voicing my feelings are translated as  oh  because youre a guy and thus a perv  right  .for me   classic  lara was attractive because she was larger than life  she s the closest to a female james bond  indiana jones  han solo  etc. I canthink of in fiction. she was the very definition of  needs no man   she was tough  resourceful  undefeatable  quippy and just effortlessly cool. for the most part  she did what she did because she wanted to  she was wealthy enough she could just sit around but she threw herself into danger and adventure because that was her life. she wasn t a realistic person  she wasn t  forged through trauma   boo!   she rode motorcycles firing two guns and fighting dinosaurs and mobsters.I also smiled when you explained how a huge part of  power fantasy  gaming is also about looking super attractive. do we guys want to play some aging  balding  overweight washed up guy  no matter how otherwise  badass  they are  male heroes are still usually designed like either marcus fenix or nathan drake  not  realistic  dudes. even though Im a guy  I always just assumed that most women wanted to imagine they were super hot as well as super amazing like I did in power fantasy games... yet for some reason there is a growing shaming of that.I could write pages on the subject of lara  but I hate that - as you say -  classic  lara is being erased by a new character who would otherwise be a fantastic game character... but should be her own different character. not only does thatsuggest that we cant have two big female heroes  but that  and apologies to fans of that franchise  somewhere along the line nathan drake of uncharted seemed to  steal  lara s attitude and charm  leaving us only with a grim  serious   realistic  person.incidentally  which devs gave you shit  not specifically the names   ones from the most recent reboot games presumably  just wondering if it was the ridiculous idiot who was on record saying  we dont imagine ourselves as lara  but rather that we are protecting her on her journey .
thank you for making all these videos  I really appreciate the content you put out and the much needed distraction from the day to day.
I remember playing the 2013 tomb raider and I thought it was ok at best but had no desire to play the sequels even though I got them for free on playstation. I played tomb raider underworld when I got it free with xbox games with gold and I remember really liking lara in that game compared to her 2013 portrayal. the 2013 tomb raider was my first tomb raider game I played and I wish I got into the series when it came out in 1996 with tomb raider 1. the fans portrayal of lara through various fan art is leagues better than her official art right now. love your new channel melonie!
Im just stunned why developers aren t looking and get inspired by fan made stuff. tomb raider community is full of passionate people. you can see that in their work ranging from cosplay  tr related yt channels  fan arts  up to mods  custom trle levels and whole remake projects !we want classic lara back !boom  subscribed. keep up the good work melonie !
I enjoyed the reboot games for what it is  but after the ending of the first game where she uses her two signature pistols  I had high hopes that the second game would be more on the classic side. the lara at 6 15 would have been amazing!!
im seriously glad u are starting to say fuck the mob  they dont deserve anyones energy. ive been a fan of you since u were on gamestop tv and I found on youtube during the pandemic. im also glad this channel is doing well so fast because itshows that there is people out there who want to hear ur real thoughts
Im really liking those good designs!! this channel is a daily watch and I hope people take these positive vibes outside and share with the world!
I say amen to what you say. I have high respect for most of the developers that create these lara croft games. even the new series and I loved the new series even though I feel like they changed some things for the worse. but just like you  my beef is with the decision makers that decided to change lara croft. keep doing what youre doing  you have your support from fans like me
Im part cherokee   scotch  irish  english and cherokee  I get drunk and beat the hell out of myself   I have my tribal card  one of my cousins was a tribal marshal.  it does not define me  my character and actions define me.
nostalgic over 9000!!! not a big fan of tomb rider but its part of our childhood. to see her in original but realistic style is like what we believe she look like in our head in her polygon era
howdy from a fellow texan mel  first congrats on the continued success of your channel! I just wanted to say as  one that is of english  scottish  and cherokee descent  I too get irritated when these woke loons pull that crap about one s heritage! the next time someone tries to throw shade your way about your native american heritage  just do what I do  I tell them that Im a heinz 57  and that everyone comes from all walks of life as our country is one big melting pot of culture and heritage! anyway all ranting aside  thanks for sharing your content with everyone! your geekiness  and positive and bubbly attitude make getting through the work day  much more entertaining and honestly as a proud straight male  youre quite a sight for these sore eyes!. may you have a blessed day girl! cheers from a fellow  90s kid!
as a 3d character animator   vsfx spfx I love the devotion to the original characters keep up the good work on your channel. Im canadian with irish  scot  welsh  scandinavian  french  and anglo-saxon  italian  as far as I know.  you have a good heritage too.
Im not religious and in my 20s I would have said I was atheist but now as Im getting closer to 40 Im finding that more and more of the content Im watching on youtube is from religious people because they seem to be the only people nowdays who have consistent morals
myself I love both versions of lara for different reasons.I love the classic bc it was what I grew up on and she was a badass. I love the new version bc its an origin story that humanized her more so.
hate to say this but baiken is the new lara. sexy and powerful is timeless. its never outdated.
6 22 I love that particular rendition. it looks great. also a phylactery is a little box which contained a scroll that had text from the torah written on them. they d strap them on themselves as a sign of devotion and in accordance with a command in deuteronomy. so having big ones would be like going about wearing a big cross just so others can see it and think that you must be very devout.
thank goodness fans know what we want
yep I found you on yt because you were such a long time lara croft fan with the view that a strong woman can also be beautiful at the same time and it is ok! while also providing many other intelligent insights and perspectives. glad to have found you on yt and have the chance to listen!p.s. you and alex zedra are real-life lara crofts imo.
wow! never expected to hear a good sermon on a melody mac show. youre right about how the whole corporate american Christian thing turns people away from God. their weirdness and nagging along with their blatant hypocrisy makes people run away from God.
that matthew piece hits home hard! for even we who think of ourselves as flawed will try to assert ourselves as righteous in front of others.
wow you are growing an audience fast! congratulations.
what we the true fans of fantasy entertainment female characters is attractiveness  more feminine looking  acting like women  character and charisma. and this is one of the example that a fan has done and by all means  he deserves credits.
Ive made a few lara models over the years  and I try to stick closely to the legend anniversary underworld template. I often describe her as the perfect fusion of indiana jones  bruce wayne  james bond  and t2 sarah conner. witty  fearless  smart  strong  and practical while still being sexy. I also give her the build of an olympic gymnast  because you d have to be kind of shredded to pull off the physical feats thatshe does.
preach
people need a greater morality to which they can aspire. true paragons can cleave fast to their own morality  but even then  when everything feels broken to where do we turn  if you take away religion  you dont somehow free humanity  you simply remove static and time-tested belief systems which worked for the people who created them and leave them to seek out something to fill that void. you leave them to the mercurial predations of government and propaganda.
excellent vod  mel! loved all of the art!
you are you. noone ever has a right to whine about your heritage. keep it real mel... love your views and being real... new subscriber.
I personally find the current lara model to be eeeeeeexactly my  type   but after years of seeing so many franchises push long term fans aside to appeal to new audiences  I totally get why you and others wish they had never left the original character and her design.
as a guy  ive always loved strong feminine characters in games  I always have. its not even about being sexual but its just a badass character to play as whether its lara croft  lolipop chainsaw  cassie cage in mkx  kitana etc... my 2 favorite comic book characters are x23 and batgirl because they have really good storylines where yes theyre badass killers but also they have emotions with complex character development without being wokeits crazy how were going back to the colonial days except its coming from the left
one of the things I like about some of the pictures you showed is that they show lara with small injuries like a scratch or a poorly healed scar on the biceps. things like thatshow thatshe s as badass as one can be. but she got feminine curves. a single picture shows thatshe s feminine  badass and a hard worker. is a great picture.
melonie mac go boom you always have awesome videos. keep at it too. glad you are doing amazing on this channel. I love tomb raider too. love lara croft. she is such a badass and facts. fans do it better
melanie  I hope youread this. something that I live by  and has benefited me tremendously. these people that criticized  and guilt trip you. keep this in mind.  if you try to peer pressure me  youre not my peer.  guilt triping  peer pressure  virtue signaling  is all manipulation. it only serves the person doing  not the person they re trying to influence. God bless!
I loved lara back in the psx and ps2 days  but I haven t looked at any of the new stuff. I dont know what they ve done to androgenize her  but itsounds like an absolute crime!feminine lara forever! she is one of the best examples of legendary strong female leads.
if you showed me the new lara croft I wouldn t know who it was  but I know who all the examples you just showed is!!
power fantasies are just more fun. I just heard stone cold yell  hell yeah  in my head after this sentence.
I ll admit  I didn t mind survivalist lara from the reboot  first game. never got around to playing the others . that being said  youre right thatshe is such a shift from the og 90s lara. I would love to see that lara get a proper rejuvenation  ie graphical update. give us the crazy adventures  guns blazing  femme fatale that we know and love.
keep up the great works! always entertaining and informative. have a blessed day!
I hear you on the whole mixed race thing. my mother was cajun  so french  cherokee indian  and a little irish   and my father is mexican. so genetically  Im more native americanthan anything. but occasionally I run into someone who insists Im white despite all the other races Im mixed with. there s no such thing as nuance with these people  its always one or the other...
man. I feel the same way about star wars. ive known the ot for as long as I can remember--was practically raised on it. had a lot to do with how I turned out  actually. I still hope someone will fix it  but I think thatship is sailed
melonie  I saw you in a video with chrissie mayr the other day and really liked what you had to say. you stood up for your faith and stood your ground. that won me over. coincidentally  I just finished rise of the tomb raider and have to say I enjoyed it more than I expected.
I truly love  your videos and especially the daily Bible passage  your delivery is 10 10. please keep it up. this channel is a bright light on youtube these days. praying for you aunt . ill see you in your discord.
I agree  that unified lara is sick. she looks amazing!!! love seeing a true lara come to life like that. super fun
I just found this channel  interesting video. I think a lot has to do with the  oppression  of an ideal. I think this is why its easier for prettier women to talk about this with confidence  often they ll be secure about their beauty  its benefits and they ll also not be as intimidated by an ideal. if you are far from an ideal you only have 2 options  be inspired by it and aim for it or try to destroy it. side note  I really  really thought this girl was an  adult star ... the name sounded familiar in that way... not that I would know... of course. but no  turns out she s just a normal girl and my mind must have mixed names somehow.  _   oh just found out whose name Imixed her s with haha  melody marks.
sort of related to your comment about them making lara croft more androgynous looking  removing feminine curves  Ive been noticing recently the same thing with more female action figures. a lot of the upcoming masterverse female figures look like they ve had breast and hip reductions from their previous incarnations  looking at she-ra  frosta and catra figures that were announced last week. we saw it with the revelations figures of teela  evil lynn and andra already. but its not just mattel either. hasbro s 6 inch fortnite female figures also lacking in those areas. tntina even looks like she has a uniboob. even mcfarlane toys seems to be reducing the female anatomy with some of the recent dc figures of batgirl and cat woman. its like sometime in the last couple of years there was mandate sent to all these companies telling them to make female figures less feminine looking. no more prominent boobage specifically.
honestly  I always wanted to be that girl thats dainty and a damsel and sweet that men are attracted  but I never was those things  I tried to be for years and felt like an imposter. seeing old lara and the fact she was badass and strong and powerful and a warrior and yet she was sexy and attractive and feminine. the fact that lara now is the dainty damsel  she does some parkour every now and then  but she s always being beaten up and injured and limping and looking like she  needs to be saved . they did the opposite of what they were going for and instead showed that the best version of a woman is a damsel in distress  again. let women be powerful and still be feminine women.
trinity in matrix  alice in resident evil  and selene in underworld were awesome. miss that era where these type of characters would pop up everywhere. if anything new lara is less woke than original because she is overly emotional and always needs help.
right !
all of this
its always nice to even hear ppl say her name correctly at this point.
so far my favorite to play were the tomb raider  legend trilogy.  Im curious what other people s favorite game s  is are .agreed  the fans have been designing her much better than the owners of the ip lately  which is sad.
you are gorgeous and powerful  and I love everything that you said. the longer the video went on  and the more your inner personality shined forth  the more attractive you became. enjoyed the video. I am also irish   scottish. props to you for using your voice. may all beings be happy.
you are awesome to watch and listen. Imean this with all due respect  you are ridiculously stunning and Ive  been on the same page with your takes so far. keep up the good work!
its always the fan that do a better job refining their beloved things.
people will always try to question your opinions in this age. its so easy to do behind anonimity.ignore the dumb shit  but criticism is still a useful tool to keep you grounded. the narcissists online are the ones that refuse to take any feedback at all.
lara was my favorite character growing up I didn t even understand the whole look appeal till I was old enough but I just thought she was badass
I agree with you in most of the things you say. lara croft was mainly know for being a feme fatale. I understand what was cd purpose on breaking her assets to create a new idea of beauty  and thus Im hopping the upcoming game will feature a more classic lara. however  I do believe its gonna be super hard to be back at that point  because the concept of femeninity  beauty  what a woman is  has changed. and sadly  its all about selling. this is why  even though I fully support the reboot era  lara croft and tomb raider for me are alive in the level editors. I hope and pray for some of this to be featured back but I wouldn t hold my breath.
I got into the series with anniversary  then worked my way through every single core game  excluding angel of darkness   and every single crystal dynamics game. Im a long-time fan and I consider the 1996  above all else  a master class in level design that holds up to this day by its gameplay alone.you could argue that lara croft had somewhat... juvenile origins  a decimal being out of place inflating  breasts  that could pop balloons and perhaps even be used as pickaxes to climb mountains  and you could argue that a moment here  an advertisement there maybe took things too far in terms of provocativeness  but if you are defining classic tr  it is  at its core  pun intended   long stretches of platforming  puzzle solving  and adventuring in caves  caverns  jungles  deserts and other dangerous places  there is absolutely nothing sexy about that!  unless thats your kink  I guess xd .when I think of tomb raider  I think first of the solemn music ambience  the impossibly large environments  and the sense of dread turning every corner tempered only by intrigue. if you have a problem with the sexual nature of lara croft  you have a problem with maybe 15  of what the series is about. and if you need a stronger counter-argument  its actually easier than you think!go outside!yes  go outside! without being a complete creep  think for one second... are there women with breasts that big and figures thatsmall  yes. are there women who make a choice to dress with more skin showing than clothing covering it up  yes. and do any of these women do so for anything other than the simple notion of self-expression  I could understand an argument for a small percentage doing it for attention  but not the majority. either way  the image of lara croft  1996 lara croft  is not so absurdly detached from reality that it deserves complete ridicule. and I would say crystal dynamics of all people did a decent job of modernizing it  making the breasts a little smaller than triple j  lol   making the waist a little wider than a butterknife  but ultimately they lost their way.by the time I finished shadow of the tomb raider  I didn t even recognize who lara croft was anymore... who was this white-guilt colonizer apologist intent on preserving ancient societies as some wishy-washy  dopamine-overdosed unneeded benefactor  where is the devil-may-care  steely-eyed  impossible-to-kill  true feminist adventurer of old  why did I spent 60  of a game walking around talking to npcs  and why  God damn it why  did they not fix the horrible input lag
I like what you do. I never hate. I just find people who give me an opinion that challenges me. thank you!
glad to see Im not the only one who misses the actual lara.suggestion  would you consider reacting to critical drinker s video regarding tomb raider  I think he brings some really good points regarding the series   evolution   and I would love to hear your thoughts.
lara comes from a world if our myths and legends were true  and since she s a protagonist she should definitely look the part of awesome and attractive
I grew up with lara croft  played nearly all the games since I was around 6 7 - basically tomb raider series was my entire childhood  the most memorable ones are  legend  and  underworld  I will forever remember those  because I raged over them so much and they were the only ones I played on a play station  - as I am playing more newer series I feel- off  they re making her look more   young and  innocent  and  soft   personal opinion ofc I never got that energy from lara in the earlier games- in my description she was always that one girlboss you looked up to be.my problem with the unified lara  is that well- like that one comment says- she looks like a cosplayerI am all for reboots and all that bs  but for the love of all Gods please dont make the reboot a lazy ripoff of the original. I am aware the developers being hardworking and being happy with their work - but sometimes there s a limit  .
you are correct all those pictures are great and those are lara.
dont respect someone that doesnt respect you - they obviously dont deserve it.
I loved seeing you bust out some scripture at the end of your talk here. straight fire. Im subbing for the 3rd    time  in the last 8 years   thanks for keeping at it  melonie.
thank you exactly I agree 100 . I grew up on the original stuff but what they do today not a big fan. dont worry about the woke culture  woke devs etc  keep it real because thousands etc  of people agree with you
more of these videos exposing the pharisees and their fruitless aspirations  please! God bless you  melonie!
new to the channel. cool video  and good to find something... unwoke. xd Imiss old lara  but I also miss how tomb raider was more of a fantasy focused game  ya know  dinosaurs  dragons  giant statues  excalibur  thor s hammer  mages.... Imiss more of this.
there s nothing wrong with a sexy character.its human nature to find certain types of features attractive  it transcends culture so its not learned through our society  its just nature.
thanks for the good word and it is a shame they cant make a strong female character when its been done so many times already!
I think the mob mentality nowadays with games really pushes everyone who thinks different away. Im bI  and I came out later on in life  and I growing up games and movies and shows where I could see a strong female being super hot was amazing for me  I could explore my feelings without being outed and I kinda miss that. I love that the japanese game industry is still going strong and giving me gems like nier where I can see sexy girls in sexy outfits. I like the bikinI armor  I like the badass in a tank top and shorts like lara croft. I absolutely loved the newer games  but even the paid outfits are really boring. if I wanted a full armored protagonist I d play something else. I want skin and lara being a badass while still being hot af. even when I play skyrim I dress my dovakiin in skimpy clothes  I cant help it. and there s nothing wrong with being into that.
we can count on fans for fanarts and fangames. like tr2 remake and level editor stages. you could show some of your favourite trle games  where to download them and which launcher you use.
your daily videos rock just like your detailed tattoos melonie
so here is my take as someone who has only been a fan since legends. I loved my playthrough of the legends trilogy. its was definitely campy  especially the alester and zip lines but I still laughed at the camp and had fun. of course lara is extremely confident and will hurl herself into dangerous situations because she knows she has the skills to get out fine.the recent survivor trilogy. I also had fun with  but for different reasons. I loved the survival aspect and I didn t mind the design change. that being said  I didn t mind it as much in the first one where as I wanted more of he badass confidence back for rise and shadow but it wasn t quite there. I dont know.I was wondering if there is a balance that could have been found between the sexy and the reserved. if anything the confidence alone is a sexy trait that is missing in the new one. in the new one its more portrayed as self destructive arrogance.I know there are some thatsay the new design is bland and she looks like an everyday person. funnily enough that does tap into her indiana jones routes. lucas wrote indiana as a regular guy that gets out of extraordinary situations almost completely on accident. even when he wins its after getting pretty beat up.I think there can be a balance between the vulnerable inner character conflicts and the outer confident bravado. I think characters that are inwardly scared but still do amazing stuff because they know they have to are the coolest and most human. bravery isn t the opposite of fear its getting off your ass and doing what needs to be done despite your fear.
Im against gatekeeping when it comes to keeping people out simply because they re different. Im for gatekeeping when it comes to preservation from anyone who seeks to destroy it. lotr fanbase is gatekeeping as much as they can and for good reason. they welcome anyone who wants to be a fan and learn  but they ask that you dont force the culture to change to conform to your standards. thats why star wars and star trek fans are constantly fighting amongst themselves  no one played gatekeeper enough.
I actually like the redesign  even that in the first reboot game she was pretty novice. it made the story more real  it had impact. she felt like a real person fighting for survival.having said that  the two titles that followed failed to hit the mark by being  more of the same.  they never allowed her to fully reach the bad ass status she is suppose to have. I do think the redesigned face and athletic body were good choices  but then Ive never been of fan of unreasonably large breasts irl or in media. so that could be a preference. but I did grow up playing the old tr titles  and like the first reboot game the most.
thanks for involving my works here melonie! I couldn t  agree more on what you are saying. we need badass  fierce  confident and attractive lara back!  dalso  yes  the way u pronounce my name is wrong but I actually find it really cute  so dont worry! haha
I am not sure if people ever felt lara unattractive in any iteration. personally I have loved every version for various reasons. part of why companies reimagines a character isnt always going woke  but because they want to reinvent them to better suit new techology and a more adult discerning public. I was happy with boobs lara when I was younger  but I can see now  that I know how boobs work  d   that a big breasted lara probably would have had a harder time doing all she does. impossible  no. just harder. so  itseems more likely thatshe would be more uh...proportioned out. thatsaid  she was always attractive to me  face wise. if anything  the different versions makes sure that new people discover her and see her as a heroine and an interesting character. sex appeal comes in more forms than the obvious touting of books and ass. just saying.
I love the original lara croft.  I dont care for the first two with the gantsa look. the third photo rocks!   the fourth one is great as well. five is like wow. six also looks great. seven looks good to.
it actually surprised me that the remade lara statue had holsters included considering the same people who are trying to change the character typically hates guns.
theres a difference between boycotting and cancelling.
I have been a lara croft  tomb raider fan since 1996 when the first game came out. played all of the classic games. its really sad what they did to her character in the latest games and movie.
the tribal outfit at 9 00 reminds me of rogue galaxy s lilika rhyza  one of my favorite characters from that game. she s a warrior  so she s confident and tough. she s also a beautiful woman. its possible to have both  and its what I strive for in the women characters I write about.
a buddy of mine had the perfect comment about the land o lakes situation.  he said  land o lakes removed the indian and kept the land.   I laughed for 5 minutes.
well this turned up on my recommended and its nice to see someone likes powerful  confident  attractive and sexy lara as well. the thing is when confidence is high then attractiveness can also be high as well and both feed into power. the artwork shows here like she was  confident and attractive  she looks and knows she is attractive and is confident in that fact. she also looks like she s more then willing to talk and approach you as an equal and even help bring you up to her level. she is approachable but show also shows experience. also I noticed a lot of people use laras  customised 45. pistols from the movie. just an observation.
lara croft was a inspiration to me as a kid. I was very sickly and seeing lara I wanted be like her
isnt it weird  when creators make new content with the same beloved characters they profit and gain fans.   yet when they buy existing properties and change them to their own ideals they lose the existing fans and recieve backlash.how is this possible   shut up and consume what we tell you to plebs!!!seriously we need to start talking to the investors of these companies  where the real power lies.  show them how much money they are refusing to accept because only a minority of their products actual fanbase is purchasing  when they could easily go from a fraction to a larger than 100  portion of that base.
6 06 that would be an absolute dream to have as lara s design. it hits all the right boxes for me.
yeah  growing up  my single mother and I weren t very religious  but she found religion and got fanatical  upc  with her boyfriend  now step dad  while I was in the foster system and they shoved it down my throat growing up. but it was still a small part of me  and as a grown adult and soldier  I one morning after a night on shift decided to attend my local denomination for service. I introduced myself as brother chris from  name of church and location  and people who didn t know me immediately judged me cause I was in uniform and not a regular member of the congregation  telling me I needed to stop watching those violent movies and listening to that devil music...... I immediately turned around and walked out  never to return. I only returned to my home church once after that when I took my fianc  to meet my family  took her to part of a service so she could understand my childhood and background.  we left in the middle of service.
there s a reason why people tend to hate new management.
I d love for whoever is in charge at cryssie d to wake up one day only to discover konrad s tribal outfit has replaced the original tribal outfits in shadow in a surprise update lol! they sucked all the life out of the franchise with their practical realistic vision. they ve rambled on and on about how they wanted tr and lara to be grounded relatable but what I want to ask them is... youre telling us for two games in a row reboot lara has discovered two uncontacted tribes who speak perfect english  has survived falling off mountains while planes are falling out of the sky but the situation is so serious she cant be fashionable  nah Im not buying that at all! they were so quick to trash classic lara while promoting the reboot back in 2013 without the self awareness she was the reason they were still working. they didn t have faith their in own project so they slapped tr on it to guarantee it would sell  all their harsh comments have always been easy to crush due to their hypocritical nature. then they wonder why so many fans dislike them and the reboot  we desperately need new people in charge who love and respect the original series source material.
imagine if they kept the re-imagined lara  but redefined her as lara s mom. then everything would feel authentic.
we fans have an agenda to keep things true as opposed to making things woke. thats why our work is so much better
I wonder if they would get pissed about me being greek and italian
seeing you gush over a drawing is probably my favorite moment on this channel.
there s a difference between the paragon and pinnacle  and the joe average.sure the joe average might seem more relatable and garners you more sympathy from a wider background of people.but a paragon inspires you to better yourself through excellence to match them or strive to emulate their virtues.
Imyself am pretty new to the tomb raider series. the first game I played of the series was underworld for the wiI back in 2016. I didn t get far at all but I enjoyed the little I played. sometime in 2017 I think  I had really gotten into uncharted and after finishing the 4 main games I remembered a lot of people compared lara and nate together. so since I was really into the action adventure genre after play the uncharted games I decided to play the latest tomb raider games. going through the I believe its called  the survivor timeline   I really enjoyed it but I kinda had a problem with the models with each game and a lot of the stupid decisions lara was making in the games. my favorite model of lara was in definitive and Im not gonna lie  I really like the slightly asian look to lara there but after each game lara started to look more plain. anyway after finishing those games I wanted to try out the older ones and so I decided to buying the ps2 games  anniversary  and  legend  and underworld for ps3. I haven t played them yet but I will soon. Imight hold off on the ps1 games though  Ive never really liked how human characters to looked back in those days lol. and the controls look like they ll annoy me
I have never played the older tomb raider games nor have I watched much gameplay but I have always noticed a distinct difference between the lara in those games and the lara in the newer games. the lara back then always seemed a lot more confident in who she was and her appearance. she always had sex appeal in the way she dressed and didn t care what others thought about her. the new lara always is trying not to step on toes and is berated more than once in her own games. she has very little confidence in herself. the clothing in the last two newer tomb raider games is so far from what she used to wear in the older games it is ridiculous. I know its supposed to look more practical but its a video game  for heaven s sake! when I play a video game like tomb raider  Im not going in there hoping its the most realistic game on earth because its... wait for it... a video game its fantasy. if I wanted realism  I would go outside. and being a guy  I kinda like a lara thats a little sexy and is more confident in herself. the new lara is almost pitiful when compared to the og lara. I really like the sixth image that was shown. it has the realism that the new lara model has but also has thatsexy confidence of the older lara. anyway  dont know if anyone will agree with me but this is my opinion on the matter.
gotta wonder about the future of lara croft with devs being deadset over opinion. square enix does have a huge audience to consider here  so do they stay on the  common  path or go back to the traditional style that players grew up with  nothing wrong with taking it back to the old-school  for the fans at least. also  you may be onto something about game journalists developing a hatred towards gaming -- they ve spent so much more energy trashing youtube folks like the quartering instead of  I dunno  enjoying games. keep up the great work  mel!
I need to freeze like cartman until these garbage woke times are over. classic lara ftw.
bruh  instant subscription from me for being the first yt channel Ive seen that uses Bible verses in casual pop culture analyses. I think youre cool
I finished the crystal dynamics trilogy recently  and in all 3 games lara just sounds like she s sorry for everything  all the time. guilt  guilt  guilt. oh yeah that and  revenge on trinity!  I only briefly mucked around with tr2 back in the day  but lara definitely had much more swagger then.
glad to find your channel. im a old o.g. lara fan. been with the games from the beginning. followed the topcow comics ect. lara is life. p.s. truly dig your background   collection. so awesome
very cool with the Bible verses. please keep it up.also  I used to love lara croft but kind of fell out of the loop with the games. I think Imight go back and play them again because I remember them being pretty fun  and I think I even have some in my steam library. woketards are afraid of pretty women because they themselves are ugly  inside and out. instead of working to improve themselves they are lazy and instead dedicate their time to tearing down that which they are too lazy to become.
this just proves when mainstream media fails for a franchise  the fans will pick up the pace.
they are not hiring these artists  because they probably have the wrong ideology. to these companies that  is more important than talent.
3 30 I love the blood. anyone who s been active knows thatscratches happen. it gives the image thatshe gets hit  but doesnt let itstop her.
I dream of a world where fan productions done out of love for no intention of monetary reward utterly crush the soul sucking machine that is triple a movies and games.
so awesome! keep it up they only dont like your opinions because it doesnt follow their narrative. especially because you are a young lady that makes them squirm! hehe you get a sub!
the last tomb raider game I played was the 2013 one and I personally loved it is probably my fa favorite tomb game but I can completely understand where the fans are coming from especially as a star wars fan. and on the culture gatekeeping I agree Im a member of the eastern band of cherokee indians and irish and I have people tell me all the time Im not native american even though I grew up on the reservation and have a indian card and my mother and father are native but my grandfather irish Im just like ight man whatever you say
it d break their tiny lil minds
hahaha yeah reboot lara is not real lara  just a whiny obnoxious girl.
I would ve given you a round of applause at 27 36 - that was a freaking epic reading! go boom!
the  actual dev team  probably agree with the  woke  laura
I was really sad to see aloy lost her glorious abs in forbidden west.   it doesnt make sense considering how physically powerful she is.
Ive never understood why they cant do both.  why not have outfits at different degrees of practical. personally I do prefer most of the more practical stuff but the devs really should be making stuff  to appeal to the largest demographic. also lara should develop a more badass attitude over each game  if I almost single handedly fought militarized treasure hunters  undead samuraI and immortals id feel pretty powerful.
as a dude  Ive always been attracted to cool masculine male role models from all genres even if they aren t all that realistic. batman  for example  is one of them. batman has changed over the years  but still retains roughly the same personality and appearance. let s say they changed batman into an emotionally and mentally unstable individual going to nightclubs every night rather than a brooding emotionally bottled up recluse vigilante  that would ruin the character. I feel bad for girls of recent generations. they already dont have much in the way of strong female role models simply because boys buy up more action figures and games. on top of this  the woke movement is producing some of the most superficial  empty  and uninteresting  strong  female characters in recent movies pop media. gone are the female champions like ripley from aliens  sarah from t2  princess leia  elizabeth bennet  etc. what we get now are either  can do it all  mary sues like reI and cpt. marvel or secondary characters that never got the depth they deserved. so when you change a confident  intelligent  and tortured obsessed video game icon like lara into an anxiety-ridden gymnastic super-soldier mary sue who cantake down whole squadrons of trained military mercenary groups without an ironman suit  you alienate real girls women because they just cant relate  its not in their biology. women deserve confident  intelligent  kind  and properly motivated female role models with a lot of humanity and not some action super sexy battle maiden catered to horny dudes of the dimmer variety. leave that for anime where the dudes actually buy up these sexified superwomen action figures  who are oftentimes under 16   if we keep making these characters  we ll end up with generations of lazy and uneducated women who think they can get whatever they want either by being hot or screaming at some managers  the patriarchy.  Im soo drunk so I ll end it here lol.
when I first played tomb raider  I ran up to this ledge and backflipped killing the freakin  dog thingy on the ledge then grabbing it  after the 100th attempt   from then on  I was totally hooked by the realism. society is being divided purposely.
6 05 this one right here the devs need to take notes or just copy it 1 1 because its perfect  she has the face in between old lara and reboot lara  maybe siding more reboot  but is more realistic of what you d expect lara to look like and has a better outfit. has a realistically shaped and fit body  muscles which is needed because what she does in the games is very physical and completely ruin any ordinary person. realistic proportions in the upper body area  and hopefully around her backside  not sure how to say that without sounding creepy  but she 100  is lara croft.
damn right. hit the nail on the head mel! if games urinalists had their way dark souls would have been a walking simulator. screw that.
the vest one reminds me a lot of mk9 sonya blade. then mk11 came and the only reason I remember sonya s a playable character is because who her voice actor was.
the difference between fans and developers is...... one side is dedicated to what they love.... the other side.. is just hired to do a job  with no real long term bonding or enthusiasm for it. I think its easy  to realize which side cares more.   3  its the same with everything beloved by fans. and I say that as a star trek fan since my earliest childhood  who has to see what atrocities the current people in charge are doing with it  after it got passed around to people who aren t even fans but want to change it to their liking.  lara and tomb raider never needed to be turned into what it is nowdays. because lara was already perfect as a character from the beginning. and she attracted players from all sides simply because you had a connection to her and she made sense as a character in these games. no drama  no bullshit. just straight to the point and to the fun. thats what made her as a character  and the games  so popular. because that combination worked. and it worked fantastically.  meanwhile... you have the legacy of tomb raider passed to studios and developers who have no history with her and no experience  trying to re-invent the wheel... when you could just give the fans the lara they know and love  in a modern gaming environment that is not infested by wokeness and other political crap that has already ruined so many fan favorites already on the altar of  representation . so yeah  your opinion  and the opinions of the lara fans  matter a lot.   without respect  we reject.
finally  a person who s not afraid to speak up. Im so sorry they tried to guilt-trip you  you shouldn t feel bad about it at all  they re nuts. imagine someone saying they dont like your way of seeing a character and you as a developer them freaking self send them a hate letter  like who tf does that   I dont think it was to make you in particular feel bad  they were just pushing their agenda onto other people using you as an example  which is f-d up. they decided to make lara more  realistic  - fine  its their right  but they cant expect that everyone s gonna like it  especially old fans. lara was never meant to be  realistic   thats the point and they clearly dont understand it. also  I find it hard to understand how in the world a feminine character who s comfortable with her femininity considers misogynistic while making her look like a man because  she s better this way  is not.
saw you on fnt  I like your takes and I appreciate the forthright Bible reading  which I wasn t expecting
its a mindboggling state of affairs when chloe frazer is a better lara croft than lara croft.
I like lara as a  regular person  for history purposes  like showing how her final personality is formed  but the best lara is the classic one  with the polygons .
it is sad to see thatsome people  especially the woke dev change the ip into another entity.  they should really base the character with the original format  where they behave the way they used to behave.  it is kind of like things are transitioning for the worst  and the character isn t the same anymore.  fanfic could remain fanfics  and since those are mostly stories made from a fan s pov.  however  if a character has a set of traits already in the game  the dev s should really stick it to that  rather than putting their own feelings into it.  also pretty sure that the original creator of the character would be rather appalled.  though  that is just my opinion...  what would happen if some person rewrote a queer or gay character into some conservative straight individual without much back story.  I am sure I ll hear a lot of screeching.
fans doing it better atm   shocking haha. well done to them.
Ive discovered that because of restera and twitter  many of the higher ups and game leads fear making attractive women and femme fatales because it would scare away the female audience.  combine that with a select group of employees that are zealots of a budding cult being sprinkled into the dev cycle of any aaa game at anytime and you get female characters like lara croft current year.  a hollowed out husk of a character she used to be with a body meant to not offend the fastest keyboard warrior in the western world.  Im glad that mods and people still remember the lara of the 90s-early 2000s but we need to find a way to get the idea that femme fatales   bad out of corporate s heads as fast as possible.
the newer games went for a more survivalist  visceral tone and were supposed to be about a much greener lara cutting her teeth on adventure.I d prefer the original due to it being more about fun and excitement but I see the appeal of the new stuff even if I dont necessarily like the more melodramatic direction they took.
Imight be the odd one out  but I like lara s appearance in the newer trilogy. I dont begrudge anyone that doesnt  and I do agree that her sex appeal was cut out altogether. the greater issue I have is that the games have reduced her personality to a girl boss type. she really doesnt engage with her  friends  outside of what they can offer her in advancing her goals. and dont get me started on lara as a female rambo  relentlessly killing not just hardened men survivalists but actual military units with advanced training  gear  weapons  and vehicles.
leave wokeness out of our games.
abs make feminists upset because its something you have to work to achieve.
its about the attitude  charisma  and confidence which reboot lara severely lacked.
oh no melonie this is amazing and incredible where did you find this and who made this    this is fantastic !! if shadow of the tomb raider had that outfit on reboot lara croft it would of been great and done a heck of a lot better !! even if the reboot lara croft had changed her personality to the original lara croft and had her attitude and was totally like the original lara croft  it would of killed that game    and it would of been so sassy and had her witt and was so witty just like of the original lara strutting her stuff in front of the natives it would of been so funny   nooffenceseriouslyhonestly    and it would of done a lot better !! I could genuinely see how it would of played out and acted out if this was original lara croft !!  time stamp  8 58
the late michael turner gave us the best artwork of lara croft.
I agree with you the new lara  games are not bad but just not lara croft as we know and love her. angelina jolie as lara croft is the closed you will get to a real-life version.
keep dropping relevant scripture! love it!
just found you. liked this video  I will sub for now  hope its a lot more of good commentary and opinions. and not a lot of what other females do  which is sexualize everything
honestly its always something thatsomething that cheers me up when a fan project does better than the original that was meant for some woke agenda these days but the fans make it into something so much better.like the fan remake of metroid 2 aka am2r for the anniversary of the metroid series. absolutely loved it  especially a faithful metroid queen rebooted boss fight. sadly nintendo shut it down instead of working with them so they can combine samus returns for 3ds and am2r as a combo to make something epic.
tomb raider had a big influence on me and Im an older gamer too. I played a lot of origin games on dos.  last game I was into before my life collapsed was borderlands 2.
I remember when tomb raider the reboot came out and was being positioned a prequel.  I thought hey this is neat I be happy when they get her caught up to classic laura in this art style.  sadly that doesnt appear to be the case and its unfortunate laura is now the survival adventure game character now instead of the confident action adventure character she used to be.
keep up the good work  while a Christian Im not really one for church but Ive got to say you are a good gateway into the Bible haha. I wish you many more subscribers!
amen chica! dont mind the haters! keep speaking your mind! classic lara is the only lara in my book! been playing tomb raider since the first game back in the 90 s and still replay the first three regularly. keep up the great work!
considering the first tomb raider ends with you fighting an ancient atlantean to stop her from conquering the world inside a flesh pyramid before blowing it up and escaping on a yacht  yeah  realism was optional with the game.
same happened to jill valentine in resident evil 3 remake  she used to be cute and still a badass  now she resembles  generic strong whamen number 498
personally  Im like  are they gonna put laura through hell with all the cutscenes and death animations  since that what took me out of the last trilogy they butchered her for no reason at times. since they going for the  strong  archetype now means its gonna be worse because it was bad last time.
Im thankful for the fan and modding community  without them game will be whatever dev wants
melonie mac must cosplay lara croft! I demands it!
the first pic  daayyuuummm now that looks like a strong female game character. once again the fans are so much better at this than the actual creators.
I live close to a road named after lara  which is both weird and cool. I cant remember but core may have been founded in my city  or some tie to warrant the homage. its kinda nice that the city thought to pay some small homage to a videogame character. see if you can find it on google maps.I actually kinda like the modern lara  if only in look as opposed to her whiny character. I tolerated her whining with the first  but she was supposed to grow and become the lara we knew. they had three games  she showed zero growth in her character beyond that at the end of the first game  wasted potential as much as I have a soft spot for the look of the lara I grew up with  she existed because that more stylised look was easier on older hardware than a realistic look. so to sell the idea thatshe s a femme fatale  they gave her obnoxiously large and impractical  and pointy breasts  because thats how to tell she s a woman when all you have to play with is a handful of polygons. and despite being busy shooting a dinosaur in an ancient tomb  and not even considering how itsurvived and what s its eating in there  I was always stuck on how a woman with such large breasts could be so agile and capable  wouldn t they just get in the way and unbalance her  hit her in the face  you know  be an all round nuisance. she was basically rocking a push bra in a tanktop  thats hardly appropiate attire unless she sought advice from kojima  and did so to gain tactical advantage. she could drop two cup sizes and still be very feminine  and maybe even find a sports bra that fits.today  we have more polygons so can go the realistic route. reboot lara is a fair bit younger than original lara  so her face reflects that  and she still has curves  still has an ample bossom  just not obnoxiously so. her clothes are just more natural  so dont accentuate her curves as much as hotpants and tank top. and she s not a wasp anymore. I still like the classic outfit and would like to see modern lara transition to it  but it wouldn t make much sense for a younger lara to be wearing exactly the same clothes as older more experienced lara.if we can have the old lara s attitude  and then meet in the middle for her look  she d be an excellent character again. maybe in the next game  if there will be one  we can play a lara who develops that attitude and the game ends where the journey with lara began. that ll be a good way to transition back into traditional tomb raider.
they seem to think thatstrong women in games cant be hot. Im glad there are female gamers that agree that they can and was already.
I wonder how they feel about dutch  german   scottish  and norwegian heritages.I tried that entire  I am righteous  and youre below me.  path and in the end all I got was years of regret.
Im so frustrated and discouraged because of the world we live in. I genuinely feel like an outsider. everything is just getting so rediculous. the older I get  the more I want a rustic cabin in alaska with high speed internet.
church is ultimately unnecessary. as Christ says  we can all be priests and prophets if we study the Bible and try to live a life in keeping with his teachings. so much ritual and politicking was added to the church over time  mostly as corruptive and subversive elements bought influence.
I really feel on the older you get comment.  I definitely often feel like black is white and white is black is the norm.
I know the feeling.
love it    could not agree more.
hImelonie I was huge tomb raider fan aswell.Ive never could nor be interested on seeing the reboot of the movie.I knowyour talking about the video game.I enjoyed seeing people used to play the original lara croft games.I cant play games like that for my pinch nerve wont allow me play these games.since you have made this channel.I absolutely  seeing you being you like you said you are.takecare melonie
we should make our own badass sexy female-led adventure game series. edit  speaking of femme fatales  did you watch atomic blonde  I enjoyed it.
never fear backlash from people who aren t even fans. boo to the mob!
og lara was so much more feminist than reboot lara  reboot lara took us back decades to the damsel in distress
love you honesty and sincerity !!
lol. last week  squaresoft eidos  sent me an email celebrating the tomb raiders games over the years and they were selling a bundle of fan-made arts   which Im not sure were nfts for  25. the laura croft representation in these arts were completely different from what we ve seen in the last two games- non woke.
I dont know why but I think ella balinska should play lara croft. she should have played lara in that tomb raider film we got a few years ago.
you know who would make a good lara croft  you!  I think you can completely pull off a good cosplay.
6 05 this one is top 3 my favorite  and I love how eerily similar she looks to melonie too!  at least  to me
what a concept!the croft character actually looking like a female......
melonie! talk about lara croft all you like! you let the devs and other haters win if you feel guilty and avoid speaking on your favourite topic. these toxic people hate being called out.
this is why people should really gatekeep their games and hobbies from people because we end up getting woke trash in it
classic lara was not just sexy she was classy too how do they deal with real women who have curves like this
honestly I haven t played a lora croft game in over 20 years and dont know that much about it  but the one picture where she is holding a bow looked like her if she was the main character in horizon
one of the versions of lara croft s mocap actors was really attractive and she had to do sas training to do her stunts.
12 05  just want to point out that the act of  gatekeeping  is not the issue. it is the abuse of censure. when a fandom grows up around a creation  one thing the fandom never does is deliberately destroy the core tenants of that creation. they may evolve it  add to it  grow it  but  in most cases they continue to recognize and embrace the creation as the author intended. it is the lack of gatekeeping that led to the destruction of many intellectual properties in the modern sphere. in the hopes of wider exposure  fans want to spread their joy of these properties not thinking that there would be some that would enter the fandom with the intent of transforming everything and killing the creation. instead of recognizing the early signs of invasion and resisting these ideological locusts there was the thought that it was a phase and that nothing would harm the core of the fandom s belief in the creation that they had come to know and love. until it did. then the very act  gatekeeping  that would have preserved the culture by weeding out those that in reality hated the content  sprung up backed by screaming meemees who brought abuse and censure to the original fans and material to either accept their fundamental alterations or be discriminated against and canceled out. I understand your point and frustration. just pointing out that it is the use of gatekeeping to censure  something the fandom did not do initially because all were accepted in good faith to the community  that has led us to where we are now. should there be discrimination to limit access  it matters not sex  race  or creed. it matters whether there was love for  and acceptance of  the core premise of the idea as it is. if people act in bad faith to destroy an idea then there should be resistance. if there are those that wish to usurp that idea or premise then they should make their own. not that many of these can because the principles on which they base their ideals are not timeless. they are fleeting  superficial and focus so much more on tangible  immutable  physical characteristics for identity than the merit or content of character  values  morals  world building  and stories which coalesce within the ideals of men and women the world over.
I recently saw the video of indiana jones vs nathan drake vs lara and the stunt actress who portrayed her was on point  better than the androgenous crap you ve been talking about. she looked strong and badass  and feminine.
the most attractive thing about lara for me was her french dub voice. fran oise cadol has a silky and captivating voice.
they should let you play her in the next movie!  -
I have to wonder if those who campaign for an  easy mode  in the sense that they wanted to see  ever played a classic nes game. some of those games  even on their easy mode  will have them rage quitting.also  I really hate the hate you ve been getting just for identifying as you ve chosen to  on the grounds that they see it as  offensive  - that to me is being as guilty of the same  being offensive  as they claim others to be. please continue to be yourself  melonie mac - you are amazing!
haha yea this is strange indeed  I remember being mixed no one really bothered me about it while I was growing up  but suddenly these days Ive found my self needing to be reserved im half latino white otherwise I find my self in the precense of upset people... I dont get it
lol. european  primarily french   cherokee  african mutt  representin . lol they all just jealous of our superior mix of jeans.
Imiss the old lara
classic lara  confident  badass  had control of any situation she found herself in  an entertaining personality.modern lara  whiny  doesnt feel like she can handle any situation  a personality as bland   boring as a plank of wood.
Imean who isn t  mixed  if anyone thinks they re pure  this race or that race  they re fulling themselves  people need to get off their high horses and fix their own lives before telling people what to do with theirs.... keep up the good work
I have a question about the lara from the new games  cause I didn t play the old ones. so the new games are a prequel series  showing her. origin story. is it possible thatshe doesnt seem like og lara in those games because she hasn t become that person yet   thatshe s still naive and wide eyed in those games  and hasn t become the bad ass tough as nails lara youremember  or are there other big changes that this wouldn t account for
its interesting how many of them look influenced by angelina jolie s lara croft.  she may be the ultimate actress to have played her.  loved the one at 09 30   btw  gasp! .
so nice to see people call out nulara era  just square enix so afraid to have hotter lara  everything nerfed and new her is just psycho switching between cry and killanother franchise screwed over by identity politics
I understand the principle behind it  but Im done saying let s not blame fill in the blank. if developers  actors  etc  said they would only do stuff true to the original or create a new ip we wouldn t have the problems we currently have.
super brave that youre so comfortable being out as your true  authentic attack helicopter self.
hawt dayum!  melonie mac really do go boom!haven t seen you since you were with riot ages ago. glad to see you doing well  and to find how based you are haha.
Im curious melonie  how have the tr community been treating you I get the feeling although there are lovely people in the community  I suspect wokeness is rampant - not just with the devs.
subbed because you are drop dead gorgeous and very well spoken.
personally  I liked the first reboot s lara. I haven t gotten to play the others yet  so I cant really voice a solid point of view on this.however  I always looked at these games as more of an origin story for lara and I think that they would be a lot better accepted if that was the actually reasoning for it. it would be great if at some point  they made a game thatshowed her transition from the origin lara  to the one we have known for so long.maybe at the end of that game  have it flash forward a bit to show the adult lara in the future being contacted by natla  which would segueway into the original games any remakes they may want to do with the old ip s.
speaking about really cool lara art  you should totally check tombraider4ever on deviantart  I ll send you some of his best ones on twitter   they recreate the lara from the original tomb raider games with updated graphics  and she is brimming with personality and badassery  it kinda makes itsad to see what crystal dynamics done to her.
literally all of the r34 art of lara from the reboots is hot as hell. so it can of course be done  even amateur artists pull it off without much difficulty! the entire thing is being done for an agenda.
take a tequila shot everytime melonie mac says the word woke
for me  lara croft is rhona mitra in look and personality. anything that doesnt reach that level of beauty  sensuality  and intelligence  should be seen as a subpar re-imagining.
girl you started reading straight scripture on here!    wasn t expecting that  but keep it up!
I agree with you thatshes whiny... but think about it if your boat crashed into some random island and the people on that island are trying to kill you... wouldnt you be a bitscared  I feel alot of people mistake  whiny  for  fucking terrified.
@alexcia  most of us are criticizing thatshe doesnt feel to have sufficient growth in the later games. 2013 tomb raider was understandable that a capable girl out of her depth would be horrified. but itshatters credulity for her to be actively seeking out confrontations in the sequels yet still behaves often as if she s out of her depth and wants to go home. it was her decision and she can leave at almost any point  so the incongruity with the story pushing her along while the character seems only to want to go home utterly ruins the suspension of disbelief and breaks experience of the character and story.
here s the thing   fan swas ok with the reboot tomb raider at first because the point was to see her develop into the lara we all knew and love. but that never really happened...
yes I follow them  d
@melonie mac go boom  cool  I just sent you some of my fav ones by them on twitter
sexy... just say itlara croft had a huge sexy element to her character  both visually and her personality.
what they have done to lara croft is equivalent to transmuting james bond into jason bourne.
original lara will always be best lara. she s an icon.
you should look up some of the previous models who played lara croft.look uprona mitra as lara croftnell mcandrew as lara croftlara weller as lara croftand lucy clarkson as lara croft
so glad I found you! your awesome!
what did a young boy in adolscence think in lara croft. I have played most of the series  and I love the new revamping  way more intense  but I also missed the puzle systems invovled. the wolves in teh first cavern and the music they had good jump scares into eventually some demonic realm. fun story.. adn even some urban stuff the original and the die hard triology that came out at the same time  blows my mind how muc hthey put into the game itself... when you see passion and love ina game  I woudl still  paly die hard 3  running over people in a hot dog car and or clearing nakatomI tower.I really enjoyed the music  the graphics and hte lcimbing and the problem solving and the history motif behind it was like being in ruins ot explore.. a lto of my games I liekd ot play were fast carnage games to deepsea exploration games  one I played as a kid taught me the average body floats in teh ocean at about 11 feet. lmao...she had triangle boobs so not sure... most of the game is viewing he running and he but hte whole time. she said some funny htings like  now I need to take of these wet clothes  maybe they wer esick huamsn thinking we think inthe same terms  I thought it was comical... its like okay liets see her nude  but inreality it passes  which the you jsut are playing the game...lara croft is a like teh female version of bond and indian jones crossing... in the original  perfect dark also a great story... however all these studios have their own slected and narrated system taken from the war system adn then these groups purge and propagate hatred... by utlzing the stupidity of women  so women are literally trained like moneys in soicety to kil ltheir fellow males or sons for a strange cult that controls the economcis and money of a system.. hardly peaceful ro redeeming jsut hateful... the accusaitons nad lies in soicety lol..so what is lara...lara in the dive suit... so what is lara... sex.. she is advertising fertility... lara liek any female has a limited time to breed.. and short fuse.. this formatt and women in a monetary system then abuse that and typically are products of monetary rape in soicety.. to the poitn where men physically rape women because the genes are fucked up int eh species and the balance is off.. we see this in anime fertility ranges of women... does this grab an audience I guess  but if the gameplay and story isn t there its jsut paid and not replayed... but perfect dark.. I can replay it.. and I have... what else can I replay.. lara croft  been thinking of repalying it again  but I needa better comp.. I neve bought some games out of my comps range  but  covid nad loss of income can put a damper on getitng such things..ther eis certain affinities that are attractive in society  archetectually and  other  what nots  this so called modern age is nothing but a pagan cult society taht has evicted all poepel taht htey have been in cohoots trying ot kill off  peopel building society and modern world. instead.. look at canada.. tehy extermianted al lteh kind males that did a lot of the grunt works  adn then used agenraiton of liars nd moeny to destroy them and take their works nda hten make other groups serfs in teh regions... through fuckign weird food shops... relaly a garbage planet... so yeah the new lara croft .. I realyl liked it... it took a bit of time and she did lose a bit of her spunk.. and I htought there was too muc hkilling .. and the temples were not that great  it was more like a hunger games lara croft meets dia hard lol.... the nteh bond and indiana jones style of the original character.. maybe jsut better writing.. lmoa. end rant.
I do not watch you because of your heritage  I watch you because I enjoy watching!  however  when you speak about your ancestry  I do listen  because that makes up part of who you are. I find it interesting to hear this from you  and you do not preach at me about your heritage.why would this bother anyone
great video love your new channel. sending positive vibe all the way from northern ireland.
remember back when psm  playstation magazine  ran an april fools article about the tomb raider nude code  how times have changed...edit  oh yeah  on the topic of og lara croft  check out missbriecosplay. she has a 100  game accurate lara cosplay from the ps1 era. its awesome.
I dont know which version os lara is being critiqued.  but the 2013 version from tomb raider I feel was actually amazing.  lara in that was sexy  competent  and tough.  like the very first scene with her  she falls from the ceiling and gets impaled on rebar.  and she badasses through it.
lara croft will always be a femme fatale!!! true fans come out to protect the authenticity of lara croft not this new version thats an eye sore!  no offense  Im irish and mexican!! so I call myself an american. because Im not irish enough or Im not mexican enough doesnt matter. Im proud of my heritage and Im glad you love your heritage!! labels shouldn t be put on anyone. we re all God s children!!
3 51 - browning fn hi-powerin addition to their peerless talent  the artist has excellent taste in firearms.plus  they re showing that ms. croft has good trigger discipline.
are there really that many  devs  that are crying grow some balls and take criticism.
yess thank you for understanding classic lara
I started playing shadow of the tomb raider a few days ago. I really like the reboot games. not for the story but I like the puzzlesolving and exploration. I grew up with the original tr games. I would like a remake of 1 2 in the same vain as the re remakes. just keep her looks  attitude and core gameplay intact.
love lara croft as she was made in the city I was born in.  the original lara croft.
I agree with all of this. I like her new design as a standalone thing. but as lara  she doesnt feel confident. they pack the game full of action but she doesnt feel prepared for any of it. always out of breath  yelling  on the verge of losing it. they re missing that james bond like attitude. her old look makes it all the more badass.
when the mob is bothering you. you know you are doing something right
I completely agree. I grew up playing tomb raider and what they ve done to an amazing character to virtue signal to the woke cry babies is unforgivable. save lara!
that was amazing I was just watching your video because itseemed interesting about laura croft but speaking the truth of God s word at the end about the pharisees and the hypocrites of them is beautiful God bless you Im subscribing
that was the best Bible verse for this situation. subbed
keep doing your thing chicky!!!!!
love this old spirit
naturally talented people dont work well with others thats why they can only be independent workers as to these big companies and developers only hire people who can work well wiht others and whose skill is basically to do what they are old
gatekeeping is extremely important. the problem is that the real fans were to accepting for more people get on board  and let to many posers in. now the woke  fans   fake fans who create fake outrage  who have been loud  and obnoxious in these spaces and started kicking you out. even tho your the og s your the real fans. you have to shame these people get them the fuck up out of here. reclaim what s yours  call these posers out  make them feel ashamed to even mention anything  or giving there opinions on these topics.p.s. if you think what I said is some how to harsh  then you are never getting back your fandoms. if you dont learn to cull the heard and get rid of the frauds  your always going to lose your cultures.
seems like every franchise has gone woke. I can only think its to destroy that franchise or something lara croft to me is this sexy  curvy woman whos smart and strong and a bad ass. over the years thatseems to change more and more. I feel like main stream media and the corporations live in a completley different world to the general public.
was referred to your channel by jeremy over at the quartering  just wanted to give him a shout out! happy to have found your channel  great topics!
I do agree Imiss the classic lara
6 25 I love this one a lot. she looks beautiful like in rise of the tr with more classic style outfit. lara has always been realistically curvy and beautiful. they just never showed it off.9 40 this one is perfection to me. she looks like tr 2013 lara and is once again accentuating her beauty really well in that tribal outfit. once again  the model for lara has always been like this  especially tr 2013  just that type of outfit never existed as well as the graphics being outdated compared to a concept art.these two are my favorites as a huge fan of the reboots. beautiful and practical with a realistic aura. Im indifferent to classic lara designs.
found you on twitter  dig the content!
assuming the kotor remake ever gets finished  Im looking forward to the fan mod. the release is clearly going to be a disaster if it even happens  but enough fans love the property  they ll fix it for sure.
6 55 yeah  this would have been the perfect lara for the reboot series!
hey mel I just want to say that if the people take a step back   stop talking trash bout the issues that you want to talk bout   take time out of hate on you then the people will know what you are talking bout   they will like you   love you more then disliking the stuff that you are wanting to talk bout on twitch   twitter   on your new youtube channel  ok mel. anyway that is what I want to say bout this topic of this video  ok mel. also I just want to say you are doing good things   right things bout sharing your thoughts   issues that you want to say or talk bout on social media  ok mel. anyway I got your back on any issues that you have   what you want to share or want to talk bout on social media bc it is a free state   free country to say what you want to say on social media  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day   evening   weekend at your parent s house   with your aunt  ok mel.
yeah! I love it  more Christians in the gaming sphere. subbed.
you are the perfect lara.
man youre one sweet girl. Im glad youtube finally started promoting you. I really love smart women.
devs today live in fear of offending anyone that they prefer to limit their creations to only what is acceptable under the notion of a few noisy mobs
its a shame they dropped the original look and story line from legend and underworld.
I get it now. this is like the batman fans. they cant separate freshman batman lara croft from seasoned batman lara croft. both versions are meant to show growth in the characters  mentally and physically.
tbh  uh  when I saw the reboot lara  the first thing I thought is thatshe looks less curvy but I dont think she looks ugly at all. lara is just curvy.just like you are better with the messy hair for example.
I think gaming journalists want shorter  easier games simply because they are either lazy and or they are on a tight deadline to get the review out.  honestly  I think it has more to do with laziness  though.
crazy because I just finished rise of the tomb raider for the second time last night  and how am I just hearing about this news.
I think I had only played a demo of tomb raider on galaxy of games for windows 3.1 back when I was a kid  and I thought it was an okay game back then. goldeneye for n64 and command   conquer red alert though  those helped distract me from suicidal thoughts back when my dad had died from lung cancer. either way  people should be able to like what they like regarding all these morally neutral things  and itsucks when the cancel cult swarms about looking for whom they may devour.
great vid! been meaning to check out tomb raider for a while because I love uncharted! which game do yall reccomend I start with
6 08 melonie if she cosplayed lara croft
preach itsister!
if I ever find a partner and we have a girl  I ll name her laura... her name will be laura cruz  which was the original name before they changed to lara croft.
loved the Bible verse I think people of our modern time dont understand Jesus that he was never one to mince words that he was against people who unnaturally propped themselves up as kings and wise men such as these woke people trying to tell us how we should think also I agree old laura is much better I dont really like mega boob laura but I like laura s old femme fatale look you could just tell she had seen some stuff even without the story sad this form of visual story telling is lost on most non indie games
the 6 05 one is just perfect. I would really like to see that as adult lara.
we cant have nice things mel not nowadays.
Im still amazed they didn t make sonic slow because his speed was an  inattainable standard of speed   or throw him in a wheelchair because otherwise it would be offensive to people who dont have legs or something... also they ll nerf robotnik s genius level intelligence because it would be offensive to dumb people x d its like we re living in the script of the incredibles its pathetic
Im mixed too. I was once told by a black co-worker that I cant experience racism because Im white and then a white co-worker said I wasn t really white because Im puerto rican.
you shouldn t be bullied by developers  no one should.  I think the remake of lara croft was ok but really left a massive hole for that kick ass super adventurer woman.
if you like those  you d like the comicbooks drawn by michael turner in tombraider witchblade  drawn in the 90s   in top cow comics.
the great thing about the original tomb raider games was that there was no easy mode - and no quicksave. the game started  stuff happened straight away  and you either got with the program  or the program kicked your butt. millions of people had to get good ... and they did  because gamers want to be challenged  not be fed soft food and sent to bed.
hate keeping  is healthy she s  we argee  . w what  no no no its not ok
strong scripture. itshould make us all stop and think about the things that we do. thank you for that. God bless you and your family. duane.
6 08  now that right there should be the character model for a future game
100  for the lara at 6 18
people play game characters to immerse themselves in something they couldn t achieve in reality. the new lara croft is something I could pull off in drag.
I was so disappointed with the new lara I tried to recreate her in gta and red dead 2 online. well  kinda... my gta character is korean and my red dead character is a blonde but I was still able to recreate her costume. I posted pics on my instagram and got some decent feedback from random people
God bless you meloniemac.
I just realized that the explosions on your video images are not random and are right under your head plane. like your drop n bombs. love it even more now! lol
I totally agree with you  lara is best as the curvy hot babe she s supposed to be.  but I do love playing the new games  they are very well made  sucks she s not super hot in them.
went to the arcade saw the tomb raider game   you are forever in connected to anything tomb raider for me.
have you seen that old cartoon network clip of lara croft playing a game on a tv all wild with grimacing  arm straining and drama as the camera is panning around   to show she s getting her @   beat playing pong  Imight be misremembering  but I think she rage quits by blasting the tv with her guns.
personally I will always like the lara croft style from the original square enix reboot. similar to the one at 7 13
I really do miss the old well-spoken han solo version of lara. why would they change what worked so well and solidified her popularity  I can understand a slight redesign  but making her weak and always getting hurt  why take away her strength and confidence  I thought they liked strong  female characters.it is very important to be a critical fan. the ideal fan can enjoy the game show whatever but still admit the faults and push for improvement. Im a pok mon fan and hooo boy are there a ton of things I have issues with in the current games. the limited dex  limited move pools  long intros filled with hand-holding and so many gimmicks that only show up once and then get replaced with a worse mechanic.fans know what is good. are other things also good  yes. could the whole thing still be good even if it isn t all what the fans want  sure. you gotta play to the fans to some extent  though. I would say that ghostbusters 2016 did not play to the fans much at all  for multiple reasons  and we saw it fail hard. some people still like it  yes  but not on the level as the first two movies or even afterlife.afterlife went down a path the fans liked. was it perfect  no  I have my issues with it but it was more in line with the spirit and feel of the original movies than the reboot. itshows how listening to the fans helps. look at the sonic movie reworking the character model for sonic to something more game-accurate and less cave goblin after the fans spoke up. it just got a green light for a third movie and a knuckles series.
angelina jolie is lara croft. she was perfectly cast and embodied the role
I love tomb raider. its one of my favorite video game franchises of all time. when I see people trying to force their views onto me or others I sit there and think   dude I dont care. call yourself whatever you want  believe whatever you want. just stop trying to tell me how to feel.  thats the problem with the woke they act so self-righteous but in the end are just a bunch of hypocrites in the end and you can never please them because they ll always find something to complain about.
yes me being mixed I feel you melonie! 12 40
I just love your videos they are so right on
angelina jolie best lara cause she pulls of the tough woman role without it being even slightly laughable or blatantly unbelievable cause she has a natural action hero presence.
the pictures totally give me old school tomb raider vibes
you deserve more subs
thats one of my favorite moments in the Bible. Jesus really put the scribes and pharisees on blast! if I remember correctly  wasn t this after the pharisees accused Jesus of using the power of satan to heal the blind man
the one at 6 50 is perfect for a modern laura  I served in the military with a woman who looked like that and she was played it up
good for them
a five hour game better have a five hour cost.
I know how you feel. Im 1 16 native american.  but caltre shot not be limited to skin color. my granother tried her best to tech me about it . she 1 4 natives american.
I dont get it  they remade the series and remade her look. she looks 10x better in the first remake than 2 and 3 but thats because the model they used was prettier. she at least looks realistic now
the lighting on your videos seems really clean.
never give up.
when I first played tr legend I was blown away with this beautifull badass inteligent heroine she was such confident  inspirational women that always managed to look good although she came out from fight with horrible monsters from me  she was mix of indiana jones james bond and bruce vayne and in my opinion new   lara   and I call her that losely  dosen t compare to icon og lara wasits especially sad because old lara may never return because woke game devs and critics find her problematic although as Imentioned its bullshit if you want to make your own shitty franchise go ahead but dont ruin one of most iconic fictional female characters in all of fiction and dont shame her to praise your new excuse of character
damn this looks like authentic og lara craft
im fine with the new lara croft from the trilogy  but kinda sucks she s not as busty or doesnt show as much skin from before  but that 6 20 skin wouldve been sick and cool as a main outfit. probably a mod for it now xdthe games I didnt like as much tho from the trilogy  rise and shadow felt pretty much the exact same  2013 s was the only good one  crashed and stranded on island with some friends and mentor  cool supernatural element like early uncharted s really felt like 2 s them being protectors   and a good atmosphere with good voice actors  pretty sure og teen titans cyborg and nathan drake voice was in the game as basic enemies
pretty sure the dev team is as much to blame for it as anyone else
the woke movment has gone 100 loopy and I onced had gender dysphoria in my 20s yet I was able to move on and just add the female to the male in me now Im happy as man and love masculine stuff
imo  best lara was the reworked lara that made the appearance on ps3.  the japanese adventure was dope and she was genuinely an attractive female.  that character design was a very realistic version of lara as opposed to the ps1 lara which is still awesome.
10 47-why miss croft   after all my years of service-I always tell you to bring me ice tea  not hot tea  you forced me to take drastic measures
I bet the original devs wouldn t have a problem. let s remember that tomb raider was originally created by uk developer core design but the ip is now owned by square enix and the games are developed by us based crystal dynamics.
cool youre part irish  on my mom s side Im irish  from a dalcassian sept that had been royalty for a few centuries until everything was stolen from them in 1318ad  and on my dad s side Im french mostly and a few other things. it doesnt really matter of course  but eh its still interesting to know imo.
fans do it better  because they care.
me and my sisters complained when it came out. though  we were pretty much drowned out.  like you ripped off uncharted and took all the crazy shit and stuff we liked about tomb raider and lara. her accent  her badass not give a shit attitude. she shot tigers  no fucks given  she robbed tombs  no fucks given. she was a rich badass  who had no issues breaking the law doing gravity breaking  things like pushing huge blocks to solve puzzles and etc. the new games took that away it didn t feel like tomb raider anymore. frozen butler cracked me up  we all did that.
the devs dont like that you are a female  criticism what they have done to lara.  they want to believe that what they are doing  is approved of by women.  if you were a male  they would just dismiss what you are saying.also  their hypocrisy is just crazy stupid  because they have no problem making some male characters in an unrealistic manner.
Im half honduran  you ll never guess thatsince Im white with freckles and red hair.  the only time I ever bring up being mixed race is because itsurprises people and because of the rarity of red heads being hispanic as well  otherwise my race or skin doesnt matter.  I dont focus on it  it means nothing in the long run since its an immutable characteristic.  I just want fun and interesting games with compelling or silly stories that cantake whatever it wants to make it reach those goals.  these woke gatekeepers demand only people from that group culture should make the game  what if there aren t any that want to make a game   what about the people from those groups that just love the fact someone wanted to take elements from their history and bring it to a wider audience   we know the answer  its never what the cultures races want  its about the woke mob cult demands and ideology  anyone other than them must conform and see only separation and race or be completely removed from having a voice.
videogames are just like coming books  people enjoy powerful attractive characters. you pick these mediums to escape everyday life and everyday people.
one of my friends is mexican and irish and she is one of the most beautiful women I ever met.
I dont understand why hollywood and silicon valley are shocked to find the audience they hold in such contempt is disappearing. are they really thatself-unaware
hell  even the rule 34 artists does lara croft more justice.
I find a good balance of attractive and confidence is doing a renegade femshep in mass effect. badass.
woke  is why we cant have nice things.
fantastic video  thanks a lot
the higher ups want to make lara croft more manly looking because of the male gaze
came for lara  stayed for the sermon. mom   clean your room.  me   later.  jordan peterson   clean your room bucko.  me  interesting  tell me more.
lara used to be an adrenalin junky powerful strong she knew no fear  now she is an emotional mess crying at a flip of the hat causing more deaths making utter stupid mistakes not even I would make  and Im an idiot  lol Imiss the old lara and like I said I want my 2 guns back!
about being mixed  Im with you. Im half black and half white. there have been a lot of things I found stupid. like when they reintroduced segregation at colleges in the name of progress. where would I belong in that dumb world  with the white people or the black people  do I not get a home team  same thing with  cultural appropriation   which heritage can I speak for  Imean we all know its all bs  and thats decided by my political views. but if we were to take itseriously people like us would be second class citizens  not allowed to even speak on anything  since everything is tied to race to left  even now.Ive seen the different paths  ups and downs of both races. normally  you d think people would assume I have a better perspective  since I grew up with both and taking a side unjustly would only hurt half of my family. but no  I just get the impression they see me as incomplete or corrupted by my white half because I didn t take their side. its seems to be akin to how they treat bisexuals who are in straight relationships. the  with us or against us  mentality.
pretty sure there are  classic lara  mods for the tomb raider remakes on pc. worth taking the time to try them out  fans know their stuff.I feel guilty I never got into the ps1 tomb raiders. I was a bit of a jrpg elitist at the time.
18 54 I feel like people too often conflate making a purchasing decision and cancel culture  if I decide I do not want to support a company  brand or person with my own money thats making a purchasing decision if I then demand no one else support that person  brand or company because of my own personal beliefs thats cancel culture.
keep speaking up your mind!!!
if you take a penny and scratch away at the logos on the last three tomb raider games  it reveals  uncharted  starring nathan drake s british pen pal tomb raider ended with underworld.
good job with the vid. and ignore the ones bad mouthing you.
I hate the narrative they try to spin  on us. like saying we re sexist or misogynists for having hangups with current lara. Im a gay male and Imuch prefer the original sexy bad ass and confident lara. she was honestly my hero when I was 10. I understand now she was a mary sue and that wouldn t convey well in this era. but they didn t have to completely redesign her look and personality the way they did
I like reboot laura.. she seems more realistic.. I like the immersion...
Im clueless with what s going on to be honest  can someone explain  Ive seen this blow up on twitter the past few days. I played the old games and watched the movies  but have not played the  new  trilogy. is this related to that  or some now upcoming game movie
if the mob is lighting the torches and getting the pitchforks  then you must be doing something right. stay you! boom!
fans and modders are doing better job than so-called   professional!!!
prywinko and logan cure have great digital paintings of lara.
lara of how we called her in childhood lerka   fan since kindergarden
amazing content!
apparently the devs want to  unify  the tomb raider games by connecting the new games to the old ones  but from their statements that old-school lara was  offensive and problematic   what they mean is they want to erase the old games and replace them with new  propaganda-filled versions.
@vherstinae altheiris  thanks for the response. yeah  this is dumb in my book. lara is a memorable character because of who she is and what she looks like. they may try to erase it  but it ll just backfire.
no devs directors should be shaming fans for speaking their opinion. they dont have to agree with it  but they should at least listen and respect what players have to say. it makes me sad to see how many people in this industry have forgotten that they make games for the players  and not for themselves or their investors. keep at it  just found your channel  but glad to hear other women are sick of what politics has done to so many great games and characters. especially when they act like they re doing it for us  its insulting.
dont worry  I still think your awesome.
supposedly the trilogy is suppose to be an origin story and that the next game is suppose to be time jump where she is much more confident and aggressive. not sure if they will bring back the sexy outfits though
lara croft and Jesus in one video... melonie  youre my hero.
eeek I am so used to your curly hair. love ya tho. I want my daughter to have positive role models like you.
hello peace to you Im so glad there are women out there who disagree with the bs that is modern entertainment I personally find strong feminine characters to be the most attractive arcretype because I like confidence in both men and woman because who wants to play as an inconfidant person I live that every day and entertainment used to be an escape from that I dont personally care what religion anyone is because I know what God wants from us doesnt come from our beliefs but our actions and what we do every single day we live have a blessed...whatever time youread this lol
see just listen to the real fans...I like this channel
yeah I got into quite a few heated arguments about this topic. it may sound silly  but lara helped me a lot to accept my body as a teenager young woman. she actually helped me battling internalized misogynie  if you want to call it that . the notion that big boobs   bimbo without autonomy. but you just cant make the  dont sexualize women  crowd understand  because at the heart of it they are the ones who equate a big chest with sex only. keep talking about it  people need to know  that no - the pearl clutchers dont speak for all of us.
Bible study  gamer  tats....where have you been my whole life  new subscriber!
irish and native american  now that mix is gonna make for a tough person. Im swiss and irish so Im very stubborn and quick tempered lol
13 40if you come to brasil  yeah I know the meme hahaha  nobody cares about race... sure some people talk about skin color  mostly woke people  but in reality we dont have those race wars because everyone is mixed.I live in the south  most people are light skinned but still as mixed as everybody else. I have no idea where my genes come from and I couldn t care less.a friend of mine went to the usa and told me every form she had to fill asked for race  which is not common here  and she didn t know what to write. she s too white to be latina  her face shape is not european though and it really seemed very irrelevant and personal to be something you ask people to fill in a form. next thing you know they ll be asking for your chest  waist and hip measurements.
6 33 man I wish! what I also wish for is thatshe get rid of her bow and start duel wielding guns.
I love the game that they have out but having played some of classic tomb raider I realize more and more modern lara is becoming what donte was to devil may cry compared to classic dante.
3 05 I dont know a better way to say this  but to me this image looks like if lara were mixed with vin diesel.
I do wonder something  melonie mac.  if you could own any of the guns that lara croft used in the games  movies  or other media of the tomb raider franchise  which would you have   actually I should probably get your opinion on the second amendment or the ownership of guns for the defense of yourself and those around you or even for recreational purposes.  I can understand if youre not all thatsavvy on such a subject  but it would be interesting to hear your view on said subject matter  or even what the Bible says about the ownership of weapons for the aforementioned purposes  I googled it and it came up basically saying that nowhere in the Bible does itsay anything that would prohibit that  but  then again  this is google we re talking about.so  in the hypothetical context of what your badass tomb raiding loadout be  how would melanie mac go boom in such a situation
very refreshing well done
whenever people talk about lara croft setting unrealistic body standards  I just think  do you not see the physical activities this woman carrie s our daily
genuine question here so I can fully understand. do you want the curvy lara back that also had the larger sized chest instead of what like shadow had her look like
4 28 proves why they cast angelina jolie back in the day
didn t even know martha is dead was censored on playstation. only heard about the game a few weeks ago tho.
Im aware  but lara already had an origin story long before the reboot and they didn t have to make her a completely different person for that. story was better too.
I think she was pretty clear on that. she wants the real lara back. reboot lara is a whiny annoying girl including shadow s lara.
ok  reciting Bible versus  youre the coolest chick on yt
I stopped playing lara croft the tomb raider games after 2014the last game I played was the one released in 2013 on pc.I did like it . started playing games since 1988 with nintendo.  the last console I bought was the playstation 3 .since 2010 I only play games on my pc .  yes im old..... but still freaking love playing video games.
I personally am a new fan to tomb raider and like the remakes...but I do agree that lara is suppose to be this beautiful badass woman with great confidence and knowledge. sadly  hollywood had been taking strong female characters and changing them all because they want everyone to relate to said character...but its suppose to be a fantasy. we are in a middle of a generation were sex appeal is bad  and I hate it.
nah it doesnt sound extreme just like lara has been a big part of your life spider-man has been a big part of my life.
attractiveness and confidence  can be mutually exclusive. I dont want characters like ellie and abby from  last of us . I dont like them. and I dont know anyone who does. moaning little horrors.jean luc Godard once said   every story needs  a girl and a gun.  well lara has two guns damnit! devs  classic lara  and be quick about it!
it is sad to know that we would have to wait many years for it to be acceptable to make a good tomb raider with classic lara again  without her being non-binary or an overt lesbian to compensate the sexyness  without some guilt tripping plot  and with classic level layouts.anyway  greetings from argentina!
I wasn t a  gamer  until I played tomb raider iI on playstation 1 when I was 14.
with you being so big on video games and against the wokeifying of them  have you ever reached out to geeks and gamers
you cant please the woke   and thats why I just ignore them  want nothing to do with that  its very simple  its like  dont feed the trolls   I like my peace of mind and cant be bothered with that.
these days  fans will always be able to do it better. companies have never really cared about their products but used to produce good stuff despite that because they cared about money and good products make money  but not most companies put activism as their top priority and dont care how much money they burn attempting to push their message. in the case of lura  activists dont believe a strong  competent woman could or should exist  even if they claim to want it  as what they really want is for women to be like men  just as they believe the perfect man is one that is trying to be a woman.
90s lara is the best and cant be teplaced no matter how hard they try
I think the tomb raider 2 fan remake is still available which has her good old one and only look.
I had enough of people shitting on sexy characters writhed it be official. anime or some fan artists just wanting to make a sexy character and Im glad we re mocking those haters back good
the largest chunk of my genetic makeup is lakota blackfeet  but since Im pale-ish  I dont get out in the sun much  photophobia is a bitch   Im not allowed to even imply Imight be lakota in spite of the fact that even just spending a single day outside getting decent sunlight puts me darker than your average  white  skinned person  and spending the random times during summer out in the sun makes it obvious Ive got fair rights to the claim. but when you work at night and tend to avoid the sun because ow headache  you tend to wind up on the pale side.I guess genetics mean jack squat to some people. or the fact that you could look at my grandpa and there was nooooo question. even my dad was on the darker side  and definitely looked the part a bit later in life. none of thats relevant because pale. nono  being unable to be outside without it hurting my eyes and leaving me seeing nothing but purple for  15min means nothing. all that matters is they see pale skin.!@   @   @@  some people suck .--------detomasso s sfw stuff is probably some of the closest to the classic look  for fan art . they started wayyyy back during the crappy polygon days  and have only gotten better since. there is some of the newer style  but there s some of the classic too. and even the newer style has a trend towards the classic body type.fair warning  there s some of the nsfw type too as they switched into patreon adult content too. and they take commissions  so some of its.. very nsfw and even illegal in some areas. you have been warned. keep your filters on if you try to find fanart by this artist. unless youre into that.. in which case.. good luck. you may need it.but if you can find some of the old sfw tr fanart wallpaper collection sites  some of the better 3d stuff is detomasso s.
driving all day Ive been thinking about this issue and Ive decided  if george carlin were still with us he would say something like  if classic lara s sexy polygons make you feel worthless as a woman then youre right . stop buying video games and anime and spend the money on a therapist to work through your self-esteem issues and life goals. polygons are not the problem  you are.
13 32 and 100  hot. ya  Im simping. sue me. that nicobass project is amazing. been following it for a while now.
it is not selfish for you to want to see a part of what made you who you are be respected  nor is it childish. I think you needed to read that.
Imiss the lara croft. they turned her into a 12yo boy stick figure.
I just wish angelina jolie had done a 3rd film to make it a trilogy. she was the best lara croft in my opinion.
you should do a video with youngrippa  you two would get along very well!
lara croft is realistic
hit the woke where it hurts  with your credit card. dont buy the crap until it comes out deep discount on steam or used discs. then mod up the characters on pc via nexus or lovers lab mods
I just stumbled upon this channel and the first thing that caught my eye was that jj the jet plane-esque thumbnail lmao
... just giving you some interaction on the video for the algorithm  nothing really to add. youre great  btw. moving on.
I dont mind 5 hour games but the price neeeeeeeeeds to reflect that.
u got lots of support from the dfw !
supposedly her original design was  unrealistic  despite the fact that angelina jolie  an actual woman  played her and looked identical. so I guess jolie is an unrealistic caricature of womanhood.
go boom army reporting in!!
no  youre right. lara was never intended to be realistic. she fights dinousaurs and supernatural beings while somersaulting through the air and makes swan dives from a 40 meter cliff. she s basically a low level superheroine without superpowers like black widow or elektra.
oh man  most gamers first crush. she has it all  smarts  confidence  and looks. woman can be gorgeous and kick ass at the same time and its ridiculous their reasoning for changing her. people that have a problem with a beautiful and confident lara need to understand their problem isnt with the game or the character  its their own insecurities. im no nathan drake or whatever hot male character woman like to play with  but im not put into my feelings because im not part of that insanely attractive group and want him changed to be some couch potato. the most upsetting part of this is 99  of the peeps who bitch the most dont even play games  they just have safespace within our outlet and we are desperstely needing a deep clean within the industry. great vid  keep doing you and keep thatsame energy on pushing back all the woke shit
I too often get dismissed for looking white despite being mixed myself as my dad was pakistanI afghan and my mum is polish ukrainian scottish english
lol  now imagine having viking heritage and nobody knows why you look like youre always about to kill them  even when youre smiling
winston in the freezer  Im offended! lol
the face designs in these dont even resemble the face of early lara croft  the cross armed one with glasses was cool though
boycotting is entirely different from canceling. boycotting is voting with your wallet  canceling is vindictively trying to delete a person.
damn that is so much better
since you went to ps1 to play tr  get a ps2  and play it there. if you turn on texture mapping to smooth  it will look even better on a standard tv.
awesome channel
this is a long one xd tl dr is game journalists of today are activists by nature of the job  and are disconnected from average players  so devs listening to them is why things are screwed in the industry.on that point of gane journos  cinegames have their place  especially if they are movie tie-ins  and they can be shorter. but not every game needs to be that  nor should they strive for it. game journos obviously have limited time and a bunch of games to get through  so its understandable they cant be conpletionists  and they shouldn t be for the pieces they write. the goal of a game review should be to find the critical components  gameplay  feel of game  bugs  graphics  basic storytelling  performance  etc...  and give an review founded in a mix of objective and subjective that is used to say if the game is good and which demographics of gamers would enjoy it. if the devs fail to present these matters within the first 1-3 hours of gameplay  they failed  but thatshouldn t mean that the entire game can be completed in that time.the actual consumerbase has limited time and funds to buy games  which is why open world mega adventures like skyrim are popular. they want their  40-70 to last them at least that in hours  if not more. if I have a full-time job and a family or am a unI student taking studies seriously with part time work  I dont want my game to be finishable in a week  I want it to last me at least a couple months because Im buying maybe 3-4 games a year as an average person.this catering to journos over players has led to a concerns influence on games  namely in the wokeism. because devs are listening to journos  we are seeing their agendas and opinions being implemented in games  and the majority of journos a a specific demographic because of the nature of the industry today. in todays game journalism industry  youre paid quite little from my understanding  which by default will push away average workers who need to make an income to fund a family and life in general. so who fills the spots  activists who are willing to live on less to have a platform. this is just one aspect Ive seen among many that influence the journo culture. and because these people are outliers  the fact devs listen to them is a big reason why we see games taking these negative turns. we need to find a way to rebalance the industry to be more accessible and career worthy for normal people  so we can remove agendas and the minority woke culture that has the only megaphone
Ive been curious as to why the wokies feminists that keep preaching women  equality   let s face it they just want superiority  but then they want to take a powerful female character like lara croft and make her look more like a man. thats some real good woman power there  feminists. I dont see why they have such a problem with a smart and powerful female character that can also be attractive and sexy.  probably because most modern feminists aren t attractive or sexy... I said what I said.  love the content. just found yourecently and your vids are such a breath of fresh air. keep up the great work.
those people opinions on your race dont matter. in my eyes your 100  gorgeous
love these lara s! glad the fans still know who lara truly is. square teased us with classic lara all year just to give us a dude cosplayer lara. nothing wrong with dude s cosplaying  but thats not lara croft!
they want to make lara into abbyzilla
in italy church guild trip us a lot since we born. the only way that we learn how to respond back was pushing God to do better with many imprecation to him. so fight back any time that you can
the remakes reboots completely erased the  rule of cool . no more jumping around  no more dual guns  no more achrobatics  but the worst thing  no more tomb raiding. what should have been the core of the game  became small optional side missions.and another problem was that the publishers are japanese. they are no good at dealing with a female character with an aggressive personality. they always need to give them some insecurity  some emotional fragility. and so the remake lara feel whiney and  falsely  cause she kill everyone  frightened.
r34 lara croft is one of my favortie r34.  mostly because there is a lot of sub and rape in there.  animations are great too
I can explain the confidence vs attractiveness issue. the ideology that drives a lot of wokeness is binary in a lot of ways. if attractiveness is a focus you can only be confident in bed or a victim. you can get attractive and bitchy  but they confuse bitchy with confidence.
this video is my introduction to you.  what platform were you on before
classic lara is the best uwu
maybe someone will mod the new games with more classical lara look  with or without clothes
windows  discord  adobe photo shop premier  chrome  notepad  all these things offend me. I just realized  Ive become the person my math professor pretended to be.
I love mods baby its kept my skyrim game alive for 11 years and Ive effed it up more times than I can count because I cant stop modding
to be honest.. I think you would make a better lara than the new one  melonie.  -d
I really enjoyed rise of the tomb raider I dunno if that falls in your criticism or not but I sympathize because Im a huge zelda fan and I dont get down with breath of the wild. its not the zelda I know and love and want. its trying to be something else
only change thatshould happen to a fictional character is if the change is a glowup  now a glow down.
make femme fatale great again    put that on a hat or t-shirt
thanks  I thought I was only one who thought games nowadays are not for gamers but for corps to make money ton load and still not give genuinely good game  all they pup out is sht games  thats why I play old games more. true gaming making art is lost cause corps only wanna make moneys and push agenda politics down our throat. I love modders  they are God send.
romance scene  lol
Im torn on this   I enjoyed the newer tombraider games  as well as the old ones.  but here s how I see it    old lara - looked more feminine acted more masculine.  new lara - looks less feminine   acts more feminine. I of course never cared for her old personality  she was kind of  the one dimensional   tough chick   and that  personality has always rubbed me wrong no matter what character was filling it. I think a best of both worlds would be a combination of her old looks mixed with ehr new personalty   at least some.
100 50 toof  loved that part
have you ever seen that fan film called croft
I am 1 8 iroquois  the mohawk tribe  some irish  german  english.  but mostly proud to be a born again Christian!
God damn what a smokeshow
in all honesty  the road tomb raider s been going down since the second reboot in 2013 made me kind distance myself from the series. I still occasionally play tomb raider  but I never stray from the classics  which I grew up playing. I was  for the most part  okay with lau  but the survivor timeline is where I started drawing the line. tomb raider s gone from being the one franchise everyone s trying to copy to being the one trying to copy everyone. I finished tr2013  I kind of enjoyed it  but I never finished rise and I will never play shadow. yes  I know the direction their stories go in. its part of why I dont want to play them. as for lara herself  its like you said  melonie. she s become unrecognizable. I prefer to describe her as  generic   but youre right.fans like lito  konrad  nicobass and even julian  freakraider  deserve nothing but praise and respect for their work. they know what lara s supposed to be like and what she s supposed to look like. I keep up with their work as best I can on twitter and I love it! especially julian s aod remake and konrad s take on aod lara. I love everything about it!
I am not a fan of censorship either. but I came to the conclusion that people who advocate for censorship should be subject to such rules. force them to live by their own rules. it is very selfish of us if we are going to be subjected to their rules while they are not.
does anyone know where melonie s accent comes from
its because those devs wont be laid off and blamed when there are no sales and the higher ups check their social media when they decide who too blame and fire. which is potentially illegal. but only potentially. and extremely hard too prove. inclusivity and equity both dont equate too sales and profit.
12 33 gatekeeping now is very good
I have been a tr fan since tr1. however the last tr games have lost me due to the wokeness.larra was sexy  tough  educated  in short a perfect woman.larra is james bond  mixed with indianna jones a woman with a terrific body. now she is like a boy.
it irritates me to no end when people try to conflate not supporting something with cancel culture. cancellation is a targeted campaign that aims to remove a person s ability to speak or participate in public forums. it can also include additional measures  such as interfering with an entity s ability to do business by banning them from payment platforms. not endorsing a person or company isn t the same as asking for that person or company to be disallowed from speaking or existing. its literally the free market at work. you decide to spend your time on people worth listening to and supporting. you choose to give your money to companies that align with your values  voting with your dollar. that is nothing like cancellation.
I agree with you. I was against scarlett johansson as major in ghost in the shell. they should have used a japanese actress. same aplies to lotr.black elves are not in the lore. and galadriel is a mage  advisor character.not a warrior. she never took part in any battle during second or third age.stick with the lore and the source material. thats what makes fans happy.
I didnt mind the first two  reboots they had fun gameplay and they put laura though alot I heard the 3rd tho goes in weird directions and the rumors of what they have  planned worries me..... I dont mind her regular  redesign but I always tho he would progress to duel wielding pistol laura  with much less fear  but... shes turning.... into somthing she never was and I dont get why these  men hating women want to be men..... the female form at most sizes is a beautiful and powerful thing.
hmm  one of those pictures made me wish that elizabeth hurley would have played her back when she could have  although I thought angelina jolie did a pretty good job. I also wish those movies would have been a bit better.
first time seeing your video. I appreciate the brief sermon on the pharisees. the pharisees sought to make themselves God while claiming to praise the true God. they wanted the worship of the people for themselves  not to direct the worship of the people away and towards the true God. you can see this today. klaus schwab  for example is a pharisee. most of our politicians are pharisees. they seek to show themselves as righteous and holy and correct without actually performing their duties with humility and giving due reverence to those who actually deserve it. they seek to line their own pockets while claiming to serve the people and it is because of them and people like them that the world is in the state it is today.the pharisees never died out. they simply changed and adapted with the ages but they re still sitting in their temples  worshiping all the wrong things and yet claiming to be holier than we are. they will be denied the afterlife they desire but between then and now  they will turn the earth into something a bit more like hell than like heaven. in the end though  it will make us stronger so long as we understand that they are the pharisees and everything we should seek not to be. God gave us free will  and part of that is determining our own course. do we follow in the footsteps of God or do we bathe ourselves in the vanity and carnal delights that our short time on earth provides  they say the devil is shrewd and he is cunning and he will promise everything and more and even deliver it  but he will take our souls in the end and keep us from our everlasting life after death. he will give us everything we want and desire and deny us everything we need. that is his purpose  and in this day and age  the sway and power of the devil is strong.Im actually not religious  more spiritual than anything  but I do believe in God and Ive read the Bible several times. the stories held within are important and they teach us lessons. far too many of us have never opened its covers though. even an atheist would find value in the knowledge stored inside. good video. you get a  like  from me.  d

lara should be someone like hayley atwell.
why cant she just be super confident and feminine again like she used to be
as a man there is something about the original lara that makes her so desirable  the new one is just meh.the dev team on the other hand while doing their job are agreeing to do this they should just leave.its funny how the people who bastardised her would say women can be beautiful at all shapes and sizes  then make her smaller.
phylactery  is a set of boxes with wrappings used to protect contain the scrolls of the torah.at least according to wikipedia  -
the only one I could see myself disagreeing on is ghost in the shell. while I dont think johansson was the right choice for the role  with manufactured bodies I could see kusanagI not really caring what phenotype her body happens to be. in stand alone complex she s even commented considering swapping to a male body if her current one gets destroyed. but the casting was the least of the live-action movie s problems  really.
@vherstinae altheiris  yeah good point about ghost.
I question anyone to say how they think lara croft is anything but strong or independent. she s a member of the aristocracy  loaded with money  and fit and strong and agile enough to kill a dinosaur. sorry  I dont see how she is rich when she is part of the literal 1 percent.
I dont like when everything gets infected by this woke pandemic
you know what sucks  the fact that underworld never got a squeal. after that dlc their are two lara crofts running around  and one of them has super powers! I want to see what happens with that. rise of the tomb raider was ok but that whole reboot trilogy was just terrible. I ll just play the older games.
I really like angelina jolie in the lara croft movies  but I always kinda thought that maybe elizabeth hurley could have been a better fit  problem is she s never been much of an action star in movies.
got into tombraider thanks to the reboot. love the emotional and psychological journey  love the more grounded style. love the determination  stubborness  sheer force of will of the girl. love how she grows  fails  fall and in the end ryse from the shadow... eheh  would prefer more meat on the girl.. she is seriously skinny in the upperbody department for someone who does pushups all day long  og lara is a plank of wood. has the generic badass chick personality... been there done that. booring.now trying l a u although certainly a step down in storytelling and character growth.. can understand the appeal.. although soo much more potential in the reboot. hands down. no competition..make no sense to give lara unrealistic proportions if the game tries to be photorealistic.. every og lara from I to underworld was stylized and cartoonish to a point. it was a specific choice  also due to lack of photorealistic capacity in videogames at the time  if the franchise keeps a grounded photorealistic art direction a stylized lara makes no sense..would just be uncanny valley as hell.powerful lara Im all for it. plank of wood from a personality point of view.. not so much.also no short shorts  skimpy shirts or dual wielding.goofy  impractical and dumb..dual wielding pickaxes  all for itdual wielding pistols  please no. how do youreload  how do you aim down two sights cartwheeling in gunfights  if youreally want it.. just makes you a bigger target but hey.. powerfantasy.. frankly I prefer lara in a practical tactical gear than in skimpy impractical outfits. the first makes her look badass and prepared  the latter make her look like a poor excuse for a cosplayer..or a new exclusive from brazzer...women are way sexier in tactical gear than in skimpy outfits. but Imight be biased.frankly as the biggest anti-woke-garbage person I am really confused how  modern lara  is  woke ... what because she is a complex grounded character and not the generic quippy one liner badass character because she isn t a dd and doesnt wear skimpy outfits  whut  how  where  Im really confused..og lara was iconic in part because for long she was the only famous female character.. regina was big for a time but dyno crisis failed to move forward.. and she was extremely iconic while being sassy and sensitive and smart and complex and badass.but again failed to stick the landing.tomb raider was dead before 2013.. the reboot trilogy sold as many copies as the og games.. and while the landscape of game is sooo much bigger now and tb still is no juggernaut.. it was singlehandedly saved by cd. nobody would hear of lara croft if it weren t for tb  ryse and shadow.. with all their shortcomings..Im gonna just say that if the  iconic lara  is the one captured once in a videogame series and you cant move from that.. you got a problem..just saying.duke nukem was cool and badass.. also incapable of holding a franchise.
when the first tomb raider remake came out in the early 2010s I thought it was gonna be showing the transformation from average archeologist to bad ass chick but was disappointed
fans who love  there favorite video game tv show or movie that love will bleed though fan art or content they make
exactly lara... so hot... she rejects guys even in their own dreams.
I like tomb raider also. I even like final fantasy games  assassin s creed games  ace combat 4 5 zero 6  and 7  persona games  horizon zero dawn. the one thing I do know that the story of lara croft with square enix is to me lara crofts beginning of her journey to become a tomb raider. look I read books  do any other people read books  even you  I read a book that to me is a base to all characters journeys and even our own.  the hero s journey   by joseph campbell. every character from movies  tv shows  books  video game characters  and even real people need to have the  hero s journey!  the lara croft in the game tomb raider from square enix is the beginning part of lara croft s  hero s journey   and the other 2 sequels is also part of her journey and more done the line where she becomes the bad ass lara croft we all know. but I am not trying to be rude to anybody but ever since I read joseph campbell s book it helped me to understand the characters and also finding out that there are characters that dont make sense. I understand that lara croft s personality changed but again she is the young lara croft that is going through her own hero s journey until she becomes the independent bad ass lara croft we know from the first tomb raider game and the movie.
tell the devs that this is still the u.s a. and they will just have to put up with it. never stop speaking your mind.
lara croft is such a bad ass  she should be an og rainbow operator.
you are extremely beautiful and wise. thank for doing God s work.
youreally are  two  awesome!
Im full celtic and not offended I think your very sweet and unique sister a red celt.
Im not a tr fan  Im still new to the games to see myself as one  so I dont know if some people are going to say that what I think doesnt matter because Im not a fan and I dont really care  but I really like both versions of the character  I get why many fans dont like reboot lara and its ok  honestly I feel that the devs should make a compromise with how they approach the games  like they shouldn t go full fantasy or full realism either  all of this issue could be avoided if they tried to achieved balance  like they could totally started the story just like they did with tomb raider 2013  then in rise of the tomb raider they should have develop lara in a way thatshe could become more in line with og lara and then in the third game they could have a lara that its just like her original self or at least a lara with a personality resembles better the og lara. tbh the real problem its not the design  imo its decent for a first heavy redesign but it really needed a more og lara vibe   the real problem its the characterization  if you are going to change a character you need to keep many of their original characteristics so it can be recognizable  and even if I really love reboot lara as a character the truth its thatshe doesnt share many things with og lara  and just as an example  Im a huge transformers fan so having a character being changed to the point of being someone else its something normal for me  the point is that the faces of the franchise change designs a lot and obviously that divides the fans and the only reason as to why that kind of works its because they retain their personalities! they just have a new look and sometimes they add new traits to them  but the core personality is still present  and thats the point of making new versions of a character  use what the og version gave you and improved it adding new things to them  thats all  if you want to take away some things its okay too  but like I said multiple times in this comment  the core of their personality needs to be there and if its not there  then its another character just using their name.
its cause these people are empty and miserable inside they re unhappy in life so they have to destroy others I honestly dont befriend people with a victim complex
square enix  if youre reading this  I have a challenge for you  step 1 invite anita sarkeesian to play a few tomb raider gamesstep 2 ask her for notes and suggestionsstep3 make a game based on her notesstep4 make another game doing the exact opposite of whatever anita sarkeesian saidstep5  release both games on the same day at the same locations for the same price.maybe the anita approved version will do well  maybe the other version will do well. I dont know. I already know which version I d buy  though.
I had dream they cut lara croft hair and tomb raider went full woke before tomb raider 2013
18 34 nerds are teaching normies how to code and they dont even realize it.
I think they dont hire the fans because the fans wouldn t be submissive and ruin the ips and characters when the higher ups tell them to. unlike the current devs who have long ago sold out and honestly they do not care or like games anymore. fun while they were young and started out but over time morally broken and defeated  they cant really enjoy games as a fan when they are having to also create games on a deadline  and lastly completely corrupted by the toxic sjw atmosphere in the gaming community that is extremely small however they are very annoying and loud  because they are mentally ill .
yeah  the first reboot felt natural. other than the lack of british accent and wealthy upbringing  I could see that lara becoming a badass and tearing through tigers and dinosaurs with twin pistols. then instead they duct taped the last of us to uncharted and dipped it in a washed-out filter and emo writing.
the one thing I do want to add is that during the hero s journey  the person or character s  they ll find out who they truly are and what they want to do.
omg thank you! someone who sees it as I do!  3
@alexcia  really  I am glad. and thank you. if possible can you explain  if its okay with you.
@john cipher  like you said the reboot is an origins story  a story of how lara became a tomb raider and thatshe isn t the badass we all know and love yet.
@alexcia  that is exactly what I am trying to say and thank you for saying it alexcia
@john cipher  of course    I share your opinion so I had to say something
@alexcia  ever since I read joseph campbell s book  the hero s journey   I have a different perspective on character s that really make sense and those that really dont make sense. I was wondering if known joseph campbell or any of his books  I am just wondering
@john cipher  I haven t read it no but Imight now.  Im just a fan origin stories
aod was the last shred of old lara and it was only in the models  and the way she carried herself  legend ruined all that
these pieces of fan art or lara are great and are a better representation of the character than what they attempted to do with the reboot. making obviously outlandish or stylized characters  more  realistic  or  modernized  misses the point of why many people were attracted to these characters in the first place. the arrogance and holier than thou attitude some of these western devs have is obnoxious and definitely shows in the end result. I know reboot lara has her fans  but that is not the iconic iteration of her.
I  also love this hair style as well.
whether we talk about cultural appropriation or any other topic  its easy to see the the woke types dont realy care about who they claim to defend or what they think about the subject  what they care about is to be regarded as the  hero   it doesnt matter if they actually upset or damage the cultures or people involved  the narcissistic pursuit is all that matters.
keep in mind that core design screwed up with the horrible angel of darkness  eidos had no choice but to search for a new developer. the other thing to think about is tr was failing  meaning the story was being told over and over. legend of zelda  ocarina of time beat out tr one year  then along comes uncharted which did better than tr. I have been playing tr from the beginning  and I do miss the older games  but I also understand the change  because had the industry stayed with the original formula  tr would ve died decades ago. the change was necessary for tr to continue being a huge part of the gaming elite.

kerrygold butter is the best! irish grassfed!
I am a mix of native american  I think cherokee  and mostly a cluster f ck of europe  damn near every nationality
is it just me or are all industries  gaming  cinema  sports  etc  kinda disconnected from reality and fans nowadays
you said she was a power fantasy. then I thought up all her attributes.father died...acrobat...photographic memory...uses guns... sexy cat burglar skills...detective...rich family...serious thrill seeker....she s the fucking bat family in one!
you love laura croft   lol and   look how much they look alike   look how much they look alike  but thats not narcissistic is it
Jesus wasn t the patchouli-scented hippie so many people want him to be these days  thats for certain. its refreshing to see such passion for the Lord that you have. oh  and by the way  a proselyte is a person who has converted from one opinion  religion  or party to another. God bless.
just treat the mob like insane asylum escape patience... I think you already do the way you call them mob so casually. lol!
the irish criticism is just a joke that we irish play on americans  because most americans claim they re irish  and most of the time the ties are very slim.  most of the time I d say something like  so was your cousin s aunt s dog irish  .
I will never understand american s obsession with skin color and percentage of ancestry. these do not determine who you are. its your experiences  ideals and decisions that matter.
Im customizing the action figure from years back
that is my favorite piece of scripture!that and the most powerful two words   Jesus wept .
the first one was just lara croft reborn as old-school sara connor terminator 2 level of bad ass and the others no less cool.
at this point they should just end the series and never touch it again and make something new
lara fights t rexes  greatlara has a super toned physique a gorgeous face and great curves at the same time  too unrealistic! the lara that was put into the new game is still an attractive woman  and someone I would totally be into. but she s not lara.
eidos screwed core design by not giving them enough dev time
well youre not really correct here coz fans come a broad range of areas and all have varying tastes and opinions. just because you dont like something doesnt mean other fans feel the same way. in certain cases where there s a large negative reception i.e. new star wars trilogy you d be correct but in cases like this reboot tomb raider not necessarily. the new tomb raider brought in a lot of new players and the old ones who didn t mind a different take also took no issue as well
her father didn t die in original canon  he disowned her as did her mother. but the movie and crystal dynamics ruined her backstory
@melonie mac go boom  I didn t think being exposed would be this painful.
yes!
you look so much like her though lol
I actually dont mind the lara from the new games  mainly because I prefer realism more in these style of games with characters having realistic proportions etc. the one thing that annoyed me with old lara  though she was great as well  was who goes to battle and life death situations with hardly any clothing  to me it makes her look a little stupid. her kitting up with the right gear  clothing  and looking realistic I think allows female gamers to relate to her more. it may even be good for male gamers to see a more realistic woman perform her feats. though I understand your perspective and yours is completely valid too. depending on the type of gamer you are and who lara croft is to you  a stylized version of lara may be best for many other gamers too. so why dont they allow different models to be selected at the start of the game  or even a multiverse coop game!!!
Im so tired that I thought you said  melonie back
to be fair this enitre concept as a whole is a lot more complex than most  woke folk  realize. whereas most would demonize men for  oversexualizing  lara  in reality men simply respect her character. shes beautiful  intelligent  and strong needing no help from anyone.if anything most feminists should love lara as a character  but they themselves tend to be very hypocritical and therefore are sexists themselves. hence why the try to  desexualize  her character just like many others. they only see them as sexualized characters  and dont acknowledge all the positive qualities written into the character that helps tie in their overall character in how they are meant to be portrayed and perceived.
for me it is in the eyes.
tbh tomb raider would now be considered underated im ngl I played the shit out of legend and not out of sex appeal just because shes a badass
new here  loved the vid
ma am I know this video is old but just wanted to say be your own person  you are entitled to having your own opinions  speak your mind and dont care about who thinks what of you. nobody should be denied being able to speak freely  everyone has the right to free speech.
its pretty ironic how original lara was actually a strong and confident female who dont need a man and kickz ass like the wokesters like to pretend everyone can be  and the new woker version of lara is way more emotional and acts out a stereotype of a basic female... if anything they should be pushing for more of og lara  but I guess its sexist because a man made it
carnivore girl   subbed.
the classic lara Ive always known to be fearless  witty  clever  the new one is just... boring.
just remember you cant have the wrong opinions or they ll demonetize you lolol
I wonder why the gaming industry cant just balance sex appeal. take doom eternal for example  there s no sex appeal but you gotta admit the barbarian outfit for doomguy is showing a lot of skin while accentuating the body of a man you dont wanna f  k with  or do want to  idk  be you man or woman or whatever floats your boat
unwoke sexy lara is best lara.I haven t played the newer  generation  of games but I dont really intend on doing that. I played tomb raider in its prime without the modern nonsense. I am happy.
cool. I have a brother whos part irish. we dont say cousins. we just say brother  sister  mom  dad  grandma  grandpa. we are all family. everyone else may say aunt or uncle. to us its mom and dad. even I have some irish in me and I have a beard. I love my beard. its like the irish blood skipped my grandpa  and dad. but woke back up a tiny bit just for me to have my beard compared dad and all my brothers. oh yeah noice. and if people say you dont look native. they dont know what the hell their talking about. not lying you look like my sister from the saganey side of the family from longhouse valley. truly you do. you even wave you arms like her. just a  aaaaaaaa  little big brother wazs up. heard ur havin a met t ting  long vowel.
pretty ironic that the same crowd that runs on being anti-racist would be the first one to critisize someone s native background bc that person is of the paler persuasion. I catch the jokes every once in a while  but its always put to bed when I take out a pic of my dad. also to note  your comment on not looking like the redskins logo.. there s a chart floating around of the facial structures of most native tribes  and lo and behold  the ones from the south eastern states share a lot of european features.
I click for the cute girl. stay for the good takes!
at the end of the day fuck the woke  if someone does something that isn t hurting themselves or others who gives a shit  let people enjoy the things that make them happy. enjoy life the way you want  play games that you enjoy and so what if a female character is sexy and strong and smart  just like if male characters are buff and strong and smart who cares its not real its just a game you know. story and design is what attracts people to games not wokeness or over sensitivity. sorry this was just my rant and yea  anyway great vid you game loving fun beautiful lass you. keep it up and enjoy what you enjoy
I dont understand how  they  feel a woman is more  empowered   more  empowering   a better role model for girls  being a masculinized woman.  that was the appeal of lara croft  she was powerful  rich  kick a   kicked a  and still was lady croft  female and feminine.  to me that is so much more  empowering  to me.  until they mess it up soon  james bond was the coin flipside.
one of the sexiest things about lara croft is her body parts aren t covered in tattoos.  no shade  just my opinion.
so many great points ruined by looking for answers inside a book that would have lara stoned to death.
yes.  7 26  exactly.  this right here.
tomb raider fans  I love lara croft but the people that make lara croft dont love me star wars fans  first time  ghostbusters fans  thats cute  but seriously I absolutely believe that if women want to be represented in videogames by androgenous featureless cubes or whatever  thats great. have at it. you do you. Im not paying for it  though. I recently baught one of the older tomb raider games specifically for the box art and I regret nothing. if a more recent game has dlc that makes her look and dress like angelina jolie  I will add it to my wishlist and think about it next pay. I also really like the shantae games.
lara croft with the blue dress though. sheesh...
top cow had awesome tomb raider comics. dark horse killed the comic with crap art on the last mini. randy greene made the modern artists look bad with his flashback mini
unfortunately  social divisions sell!
I just dont get why people need to make things more woke. tomb raider hasnt been a big part of my near 3 decades  but I still remember my dad playing the original games as a kid  and playing some of the mid 2000s games myself growing up  and she was amongst the niche of badass female protags alongside ellen ripley  sarah connor  arwen  leia and so on that proved that you can be a total fuckin badass  yet also be feminine and sexy at the same time. I get the whole  dont over sexualise  thing  but its apparently not okay anymore to find a female attractive while shes laying the beat down or saving the world.
disregarding her changes in appearance  the new lara croft still sucks.original lara was someone who made things happen  not someone who had things happen to her. original lara had setbacks  but was relentless in overcoming them  like james bond.  new lara is a whiny screwup.original lara was large and in charge  a force to be reckoned with.  new lara is an emo brat.the woke devs must hate strong  confident  competent women.compare lara as a teen in tomb raider  the last revelation to lara as a teen in the 2013 reboot.  in the former  even as a teen  she was still kick-a   confident   relentless.  in the latter  she s all waaaaa  waaaaa  waaaaa  someone help me.
yeah I did nt even play the 3rd remake of tomb raider. they made her into a  this might sound werid  brutal killer.
when they got rid of aunt jimima and the land o lakes native girl it really pissed me off. not to mention censoring the looney tunes  taking elmer and sam s guns away  dammit I grew up watching them and I turned out fine. unlike some today that have a nervous breakdown because someone flies an america flag on his truck or the confederate battle flag. meanwhile they walk around with the soviet red banner. I never really cared for aunt jimima corn syrup or corn syrup for that matter. it comes with being a native vermonter its known as the fake shit by most.
plus the land-o-lakes girl had those great victoria s-secret knees.
lara croft s best  asset  are her breasts. melonie you have something that lara doesnt. melonie  your best  asset  are your big beautiful brown eyes. if lara was a real person she would die to have eyes like yours melonie. she would also be proud of your independence and the strength you have to assert an opinion that goes against someone s narrative or in the face of peer group pressure.
ngl I kinda enjoyed the first game in the reboot series but after that lara just never progressed past the point she s at in that game character and personality wise. she never felt like she really took on that tomb raider mantle and became the character we all love  Imean now we know they never wanted her to be that and of course they made her character model the plain of plain women you could possibly make. I just dont get this mentality that woke people have where the only people they want to allow in games and movies are everyday average looking unexceptional people so normies can  relate  to them. I dont want to see myself or people that look like the people I see everyday in what are supposed to be bombastic adventure games. these characters should be exceptional and stand out from the crowd  not boring ass scared little kittens like the lara in the recent games.
making lara croft average is like making james bond average. the point of these characters is that they re larger than life  its what makes them special. everything woke turns to shit as we know.
fan for 2 decades you look 19.. just sayin but I totally agree with you.keep speaking your mind.
dont  let  them guilt  trip you. you have  just as much  right  to your opinion  as they do. you probably  got more native americanthan  elizabeth warren
now you have the cherokee that all of a sudden dont like a car named cherokee. its pretty disheartening since the car was named that in honor of them. also  nearly every single helicopter in the us military bears a name of a native americantribe.
Im irish and native americantoo. but Im so pale that Im not allowed to claim my native american heritage either.
let them do one more tomb raider movie with alicia vekander  who I think still looks feminine and is good as the character.  but defenitely doesnt fit lara croft s physical type.  if the next movie doesnt do that well and the hollywood wokeness pendulum begins to swing further and further back we ll get another tomb raider reboot with an actress of more traditional body type. it will be inevitable because the idiots who bitch and moan about lara s sexy look now are not the ones who actually  pay to watch movies or buy the video games. the real fans will win in the end not the asshole sjw s who dont have or spend my money on shit!
I haven t played any of the tomb raiders since the 9 original series but I always saw her as a bad a woman who took to crap.  those pictures all fall within the original image of lc

the thing that ticks me off with games is developers trying to appease a relatively small group of people when developing a game. its a waste of their time because allot of them dont even play video games or even plan on buying the game. meanwhile trying to appease that group groups they end up pissing off the fanbase for the game which dont buy the game because they get angry with the developers over the game. its like the difference between original trilogy mass effect and andromeda. every female character in the original trilogy is unique or have enough different to not duplicates. asarI have different facial markings. andromeda every asarI looks the same with only lexI and peebee and the asarI reporter being different. all other asarI look the same just different shade of blue or purple they dont even have facial markings. really the reason the devs did that was not to offend the groups that get offended by even the slightest hint of sexualization. also with andromeda the strippers were wearing the armor suit your character wears into combat just without armor pieces on it. tomb raider they changed the look of the character mainly for the reboot  the originals were what they where and then they made her look more like angelina jolie after the films came out. once they finished the movies they went on to make a new one and made her look different.
never put any effort into trying to be  woke . its literally never good enough for the  activists .
my guess is that they have too much money and they need sales to come down. I wont play a game with mannish looking women  certainly not when its the main protagonist. they can do it to all the games they want and it will never change what I find as attractive  it will just make me play other games instead.
also  remember sarah connor from terminator 2  a great example of great femininity
I remember playing tomb raiders back in the 90s on the playstation 1. I loved it  but I also love the new ones. I never though of the new lara games being wok in anyway. Imean she is small and has smaller breats but so what. lol
there is nothing with a character having sex appeal  especially a woman character. the fact that these wokies changed her design to make her look less and less attractive and more and more like a regular person and they took away her attractiveness is pretty hypocritical
shout out to larado cronk
we love your comments. if you get backlash it is because some people do not have a life. Imay love some traits of lara croft  but I am ok if the company want to ruin the franchise  I just would not buy rubbish. and certainly I would not react harshly if a fan has an opinion.  I have found ridiculous gatekeeping among fans of battletech  because even moderators may feel insulted if you make memes on fictional factions. I recall one spanish guy banned from a group because he memed the jade falcon clan as the jade chicken clan.  imagine that. feel offended by a meme on a fictional character. this world is totally deranged without any hope.
iron law of woke projection  everything they are complaining about  they are doing to you.
I wish devs had testosterone again. back then they d put whatever thatseems cool now we have weak devs trying to spread a message while reducing the quality.
Im ok with lara croft s 2013 look but lara croft s past versions are much better and it looks like the true fans agree with that.
great laras  first one kinda looks like jolie
classic lara had a wicked cynical sense of humour. now she s bland. I did like the new movie.
hey melonie in your opinion is there a difference between desexualization and defeminization
I find it funny land o lakes got rid of the native but kept the land to appease the woke crowd and cant see how hypocritical they are.
Christians are not push overs  we are asked to the most hard thing one can do. forgive and move past  to leave vengeance in God s hands. thank you melonie for always adding a Bible verse in your videos. I cant really say that Im a religious Christian  but I am a spiritual one. I believe in God and his son Jesus  I just haven t read the Bible as much as I should probably have.
personally I like playing different kinds of games. I liked the survival stealth aspect of the new tomb raider  but still love the dual wielding pistols action game tomb raider.
they all need bigger booba.
laura is best when shes effectively a female-duke nukemweird that the powers that be like to pretend attractive women dont exist while constantly pushing titillation
what Jesus was talking about in that passage was that the pharisees were not only burdening people with excessive laws  they were following the letter of the law not the spirit in addition to that  they weren t even following half of the laws themselves!. so he goes on to say   if your camel fell into a well would you not rescue it  of course they would but the sabbath forbade doing any work. sadly melonie misses the point that while Jesus gave his followers a new commandment of love  after he died they were no longer under the mosaic law  he didn t condone wrong doing based on popular opinion. he recognised that while they were sinning they were still human beings at the end of the day. at the end of the day video game companies have lost their moral compass. they think they are doing the right thing by including homosexuality in video games when in actual fact its the opposite. many of these developers may actually believe in God. but what does the Bible say about things such as homosexuality  making a moral stand is not always easy but at the end of the day who are you trying to please
and who are you to define who true fans are  what an elitist way of speaking
the female form in and of itself is pretty sexy in general so they do overlap a bit imo
@melonie mac go boom  ok. so if there is some overlap there  wouldn t you say that what is occurring is more of a desexualization than a defeminization by your definition  that devs are purposefully making characters less sexy to appeal to the  woke mob
where do I send art to you
melonie mac is the perfect girl  good Christian  loves video games  cosplay  understands what a strong female character is and has awesome tattoos
um  get gina carano back in her fighting shape and boom! perfect laura croft
as a former Christian turned atheist  I can safely say Jesus was no push over. he went hard with what he believed in and said and done many things that were scene as heresy and treason for what he believed in. non-Christians like to think he was all  turn the other cheek   but his track record - recorded by nations all over the world in his time - showed a much different tale. turn the other cheek when they come at you  but scorched earth when they come after your beliefs or others.ironically  woke culture both practices his vengeance and ignores his love  humility and patience. he was an excellent role-model  something even muslims and myself as an atheist can attest to. if more people strived to be Christ-like  the world would certainly be a better place than it is in the Godlessness we face today.
lara was never meant to be realistic. the survivor trilogy was great. but if they put out a game with a  sorry my french  whiny little girl I will loose my marbles. she has always been out of touch with  normal women  but she s the one battling dinosaurs and egyptian Gods. if we re scrutinizing her  let s do the same with kratos from God of war.  its exactly the same thing but with lara there s a double standard as she s a woman. jeez. just let me f sheez up with dual pistols with incredible accuracy.
they  fixed  a sonic movie...soooooo
boom goes the dynamite.
funny how people still love and play tlou original and people have forgot about the woke disaster that is tlou2.
at first I didn t mi8nd lara s new design for the trilogy. different obviously but no biggie. but knowing now that it was for some  woke  agenda I ll admit leaves me a bit miffed. sure the trilogy is very much a prequel of sorts  which explains her lack of confidence...... but lack of sexiness and confidence isn t lara. can we just stop walking on eggshells to keep the very small woke mob appeased please
lara croft s look peaked at tomb raider  underworld and then went downhill from there.
what a beautiful chapterJesus didn t play around. he called the pharisees hypocrites numerous timesand why are they ruining lara
can you be little less lazy and  explain what kind of mod it is and the name of the mod and link to the mod  ty for the video btw. great stuff
they make all their characters look the same. like... normal people in drab closet cosplay. its boring. having exagerrated  stylized characters is fun! and I dont know why people need characters that  look like them . I find it hella narcissistic. I want to play a character I can look up to and is often far more idealized than I am... also I have a lot to say about how modern feminists know nothing about feminism in the 90s and how the exposed midriff was a female empowerment thing... their takes are actually pretty ignorant and insulting.  attractive women cannot be confident  and  women who wear certain clothing aren t to be respected  etc. as a side note  this shit has literally made a lot of young women hate their bodies for being  sexual objects  and wanting breast reductions for non-medical reasons. instead of adding new characters with differing body types alongside old characters like lara and promoting both  they are erasing one. this is literally just a new brand of bodyshaming.
I totally get wanting her to be more feminine  and in most cases I am much more attracted to a woman with curves  but to me that never really fit with her lifestyle.  with the things she does  there s no way she isn t incredibly fit.  I d like to see her body be stylized after a rock climber s.  chiseled abs  nothing but muscle on the upper body  strong thighs  lean muscle mass all around.  even the large-breasted rock climbers will keep those strapped down to an extent because they just get in the way.  Ive played enough of the games to know she has to squeeze into tight spaces pretty often  and thatshe isn t afraid to do whatever is necessary to survive.  her figure is secondary to her attitude and sense of adventure.
I want my 2 guns back!
there s no point tiptoeing on egg shells hoping not to offend the woke. you cant not offend them. they ll find something to be offended at no matter what you say or dont say.if you are trying not to offend them  you have already lost the game they are playing. its not about solving a problem. its about asserting themselves as your moral superior.

lara croft is conveniently ignored by the left imo. because everything about her 25 or so year run. disproves most of their narrative. as a white guy one one my favorite franchises are the tomb raider games. I was real young and played my first tomb raider game on the computer. had no idea what I was doing couldn t figure out the puzzles or the secrets in the levels. this was also back in they day when they didn t give us participation trophies. there was no white paint conveniently placed in 4k hd on ledges to give you a helping hand on where to go and what to climb. back then I actually played this game with my mom she found guides on the internet and used that to figure out how to beat the game. next was on the first playstation. the the serious that came out on the next gen consoles. its most definitely one of my favorite video game franchises. there is literally no reason to make lara woke. she debunks every single leftist victimization claim of male to female
you would make a perfect laura
what boggles my mind is they gave child lara a bunch of confidence but not as a young adult      classic lara was confident at 16. she has always been and I like that about her
@melonie mac go boom  excellent point. the way the enterntainment industry is going as a whole usually has me playing older titles movies music etc. tired of the pandering. Imean c mon the disney we knew as kids is not the same now. imagine there being a new duke nuke em. people would lose their minds
I can say the same for anti-wokes as well. get triggered by a lot of things nowadays too. there isn t much difference between the two in terms of behaviours etc. its just the opinions
she s a fictional character  practically a superhero  she doesnt debunk anything.
the devs actually have gotten in touch with you over you criticising the modern stuff    man thats weak. if a big studio cant handle criticism thats not gonna go well for them.this shows fans are a useful resource that needs to be  mined  more often for companies. we re willing to give feedback and even contribute to the project if asked. I d bet any one of those fans would be ecstatic to be approached for their design of lara to be used in game. fans want their favourite things to succeed  let us help. you dont have to give us full control  but we re more than just a wallet.
Imixed too and people really be getting mad adn expect me to say im white lmao
where to start  I personally am a fan of the crystal dynamics lara partly cause I think she was more relatable to myself  meek and timid  and made for a good origin that would lead up to and grow into the original persona. not sure why I was never really a fan of original lara  dont hate me  please   Imean I did enjoy the movies but even then never really the personality. not saying there is anything wrong with her original style  it just wasn t for me. then again  I never played any of the original games for this reason. that being said  I do love the art work you had shown. probably if I had a strong and confident woman in my life willing to mentor me and mold me and inspire me to be strong and confident  I would probably be a different person than I am today. I am mixed slovak and chinese  I tend to identify myself as chinese  but I look more white  like any other white chinese mix  which does irritate me from time to time. especially i. the dating pool as itseems most asian girls prefer asian looking guys  when dating someone asian . yeah that may be a bad example  but its a thing Ive noticed  may be there is more to it  like maybe its my lack of self esteem and confidence  interesting how this word comes up   but it is what it is. I think there are some studies that actually do mention it too. I have my own preference  but I am willing to look outside the box now days. great Bible verse  truly one for the modern age since america seems to have become more hypocritical.
how can you say on one hand that the devs are trying to stifle your opinion  but on the other hand its the  higher ups  making the decisions to make these changes.  sorry  but its the rank-and-file devs calling for these changes.  just take a look at the recent walk-outs and publicized criticism at netflix  activision blizzard  dc  marvel and others.  its those closest to the material pushing these agenda changes.  the higher ups  not wanting to be branded  step aside and allow it.  if the devs truly wanted croft to stay as historically portrayed  you would have heard about it in one of the countless gaming or social media sites.  you dont hear it because the devs are the source of the change.
lara croft should be a queen
something that modern devs or designers can learn from  and the rest of hollywood for that matter   is the uncharted movie that just came out.that had a good female villain  and they made the chloe frazer character strong but not due to cutting down other characters.  just two genuinely strong characters without being bogged down by real world gender war drivel injected into the script design.now I haven t played the game  so I dont know how well they got it to the game but as far as a film I really enjoyed it.they need to apply the same thing to lara croft with tomb raider  and stop trying to deploy reinvent and revision existing materials based on current wokeness.
I ll take hot powerful stronge waifus over what ever d woke left want 100  keep make waifu  hot  cool stronge again
I absolutely love comparing the woke to the pharisees spot on!
was there still a problem with lara croft   I thought the reboot have brilliantly fixed all the  issues   giving lara more realistic proportions and psychology and  therefore  more attractiveness than ever.
hey I just subbed  keep up the good work. jeremy sez hi.
a prosilyte is a new convert to a religion.  Jesus is saying that for every new convert you bring in  the method to which you introduce them to the faith is important.  should it be with love and understanding  you forge a believer from a servant  if you do it with fear and power you keep them a servant  unable to ascend to God s kingdom.
what was that deadly sin that had green eyes  I cant remember...eh... probably not important.  p
its not just a white saviour complex woke people suffer from  but also immense cultural imperialism. wokeness is pretty much metropolitan american upper middle class culture  yet they claim hegemony over the entire world. a great example of this was oprah claiming the holocaust was white on white violence. these people do not understand european ethnicities and cultures at all  yet they project their worldview on things that happened over here as if they are the ultimate moral arbiters. its supremely arrogant and annoying. I can only say that I  as a german person  do not feel like Im basically identical to a french  italian or ukrainian person on either cultural or ethnic grounds. we may all be  white   but that doesnt mean crap. for people who claim to be opposed to essentialism  exclusion and intolerance  they certainly seem to extrapolate a lot from skin color and have little tolerance for individual european cultures and ethnicities
@melonie mac go boom  hey melonie. first  I wanted to say  dont worry about the wokies and the sjws  with regards to your race ethnicity. why  because Im half irish on my sperm donor s side  his family name comes from only one place in the world  county cork  ireland   and on my mom s side  Im native american  cherokee and mohawk   and thats mixed with  european mutt   as we like to say. Im french  canadian  swedish  german  and welsh  wales . the furthest my mom has traced my ancestry  to a mason named robert in 925 ce  from wales. there is also the possibility Imight be related to leif ericksson and erik the red  two infamous vikings. at the same time  in my actual family  Im about as diverse as one can find  I have half-japanese cousins  a japanese aunt  3 half-mexican step-sisters and a half-mexican step-brother  as well as numerous half-black  half-white cousins. I come from a diverse family  before diversity was cool. Ive also lived in a city that is majority black -- cincinnatI  ohio. Ive been called  racist  before. wanna know what my response was   if I was racist  I d have to hate my whole family.  and family is everything to me.as for the games  melonie  it comes down to intersectional politics. it comes down to everybody and their brother getting participation trophies  and thinking they re special  when they re not. this is why you see what you do in tomb raider. me  Im an og resident evil fan. I played the og on the playstation 1  what people called  the brick.  I had a ps gameshark back in the day. and with everything thats been going on  capcom  itseems like  is the only company listening to fans. the original re 1 and re 0 games on gamecube were actually really well done. but nowadays  even final fantasy 7 s remake has suffered. the story has been severely shortened. with the last of us 2  the story outright sucked  beginning to end. first  you do not kill off a major character after showing more plot holes than effing swiss cheese. second  the romance part of the story wasn t needed  as well as the lgbtq  sections of the story. Ive seen playthroughs  and I seriously felt at the time that the game was sending the message that actual modern politics was more important than a good  quality story. it felt like if I played the game  that I was somehow being punished for being a straight male. would cults exist as the game shows  probably. but thats because cults revel in ignorance and darkness  not because of some misguided hetero pseudo-religion. and what kills me is that neil druckmann took an amazing storyline  with good characters  and decided to interject modern woke politics and intersectionality where he never should have. and then to make the story about failed vengeance  when any survivor would not have the rookie mistakes ellie made in going after abby. abby  in that world  would have killed her and been done with it -- not   oh  let s cut her down just so we can have our big fight scene   only to basically almost get killed herself. in the world of last of us  ellie would have killed abby without remorse. because thats what the world demanded. but then again  when you ve got a guy writing a science fiction story based on the real world  and he has no idea that abby and her crew would have not traveled through the mountains in the dead of winter  let alone with a dozen people in a blizzard  I guess the only thing a writer like that who sucks at telling a realistic story has left is actual modern identitarian woke intersectional politics. Imean  what kind of game did druckmann oversee  when a guy literally gets to the part joel gets killed  and is so pissed off that he turns off the game  takes out the disc  and breaks it in half  live  on his stream  at least capcom got the main characters in re right for the remake of re 2 and re 3.I just hope that in the future  gaming companies stop listening to the woke mob who have such a hard time living in reality that they need  safe spaces   crayons  and coloring books as freaking adults in college. just because they are a small vocal minority doesnt mean they are every gamer or gamer demographic. Imean  just look at g4tv and what happens when someone like frosk basically tells the entire viewing audience to piss off if they dont like the content g4 was putting out. and look what happened. and now hopefully  we can get back to some degree of normalcy with elon musk actually closing on the deal for twitter -- today.good content as always  melonie! see you on your next one!edit  melonie  a  proselyte  is a convert to the faith -- a student  if you will. young students are like children  who need guidance and learning. basically  what Jesus was calling out the pharissees for  was the idea of then acting more arrogant because of social position. that instead of actually leading others to God  they are keeping out people who needed the grace of God. there was also something to say about the idea that when one comes to God  he loves you for who you are  that when you call upon Christ as your savior  that Christ accepts you  no matter what you look like  no matter where your standing in society is. he takes you just as you are. the pharissees  on the other hand  wouldn t allow people into a synagogue if they didn t look or act a certain way -- being a gate-keeper! Jesus didn t like them people either -- hence why he says they dont practice what they preach  and as such  calls then hypocrites.
industry acts like attractive ppl dont exist any more. Im done.
yes I know Im going to get hated on for this. as a fan of both the old lara and new lara  prefer the new lara  mostly all Ive seen in these types of videos  not just yours my dear x  is people complaining about what lara is wearing... what is wrong with trousers and a tank top  why does she have to wear clothes that are tight-fitting and so bloody revealing  she s a woman not a piece of meat... maybe I prefer the new lara because I like women who aren t over the top flashy   though a bit contradictory here as I love the scene in legend with her driving the motorbike off the building hehe  who likes to dress modestly  also and my last point  lara in the reboot is not the tomb raider we all know and love yet  everyone started somewhere. I hope we see more of lara in the future now we know her roots    what I would really love to see is for the devs to keep the style  art  of the new lara  and voice actor I think camila is bloody amazing so emotionally talanted  but bring back a little a bit of lara s old personality. anyways rant over  3
@3 30 has some t2 linda hamilton vibe to it
I haven t seen the video yet  no audio ... but what was woke about new tomb raider games  other than lara having less skimpy outfits  I thought those games were pretty cool. I tend to dislike woke bullshit too  but those games didn t feel woke to me  more like they were just copying uncharted
listen you have nothing to feel bad about. if you paid the money and bought the game than its your right to criticize it anyway you see fit. fuck what other people think  youre not beholden to them just cause they made the game. if they cant take criticism from people who buy and support your game than they re in the wrong feild of work. the worst part is when they change something that the devs know is gonna piss people off but they do to inject their own beliefs in the game. then they expect you to just pat them on the back  no if you take something that people love and fuck with it for the sake of fucking with it then they deserve all the shit that comes their way. you can add and innovate to game without ruining what the game is supposed to be at its core. think resident evil 4  a game that change the format but kept true to the horror roots of the game and is now wildly accepted as one of the best resident evil games. so dont ever apologize or feel bad for being critical of something you bought and played.
Ive been playing tomb raider since I was a kid when it first came out on playstation. an itseems like she s a totally different character now since the reboot  I enjoyed playing the new ones but I dont like how different she is to the original. that is not the real lara croft.
I personally know and have heard stories from multiple devs who want a more accurate classic lara but are being shut down by the higher ups
it was an insult to the games. Im glad you enjoyed it but they really butchered so much of the characters. chloe in uncharted 2  and the movie is a nightmarish mishmash of different games  is a deeply broken person  trying to be good but feeling helpless in the face of overwhelming odds. still she s trying in her own confused way to stop things but her self-sabotage leaves her too often as an unintentional tool for the villains. the writers managed to create a confident and sexy character who s also traumatized and keeps sabotaging her own attempts to save the world. all of the uncharted characters are very well-written  though I ll admit that 3 and 4 started to decline in quality. a lot of 3 didn t really make sense based on the resources the villains had at the time  and 4 had too many set pieces and poor fight choreography designed to make the  muscle  of that game - a martial-artist woman - seem like a genuine threat. even bruce lee  one of the greatest fighters in recorded history  was vocal that body weight and mass make a huge difference. there is practically no way thatsomeone built like nadine could have fought off the drake brothers if one of them had just tackled her.so yeah  the games eventually went full woke by sidelining nathan from his own series and putting chloe and nadine in a shipping-bait friendship not-quite-lesbian relationship. I still highly recommend the first two  however.
@vherstinae altheiris  thats fair.  I figured the movie wasn t going to do it justice.  I know from experience going into a film when having knowledge of the source material how they usually are doa.  namely eragon  and I didn t even bother seeing artemis fowl.uncharted is definitely on my list of games I want to play  but there s a major backlog.
hahaha
why does  realistic  always mean small-chested and without much waist  or else doughy and borderline obese  naturally busty women exist. fit women exist. and claiming that these real women are someone unrealistic is nothing but hateful expressions of sour grapes  mostly from women who dont have the discipline to exercise and help themselves be healthy and look good.
@vherstinae altheiris  bruh I hate youtube. I have made a huge text to answer  but Im afraid he have vanished   ... can you see it
updated for modern audiences  and juveniles  but not woke. well I will only be talking about  rise of the tomb raider  since I played it  not the sequel. this lara is young and inexperienced  since modern audiences kinda demand character depth  she has some daddy issues and insecurities but  she is not woke because of below criteria s direct wokeness criteria s 1- main hero sex identity  gay lesbian trans non-binary etc  no2- main hero ethnic identity   non white supremacist such as asian african-black colombian etc.   no  do not even ask me whether this is applicable to the title  reference  rachel zegler  playing  snow white  2004 and idris elba playing as gunslinger in dark tower 3- production somewhat educating you all the time about how your life choices should be and what is being a virtues person is  near to none4- main hero biologic sex identity   this one is omitted since lara being a woman hero5- other characters being so colorful  balancedhidden wokeness criteria s 1- main hero behaving like a 2 years toddler  but being portrayed right always  not so frequently2- main hero perceiving or questioning every aspect of life differently from common sense and established norms etc  but being portrayed right always   not so frequently3- older and experienced characters and antagonists acting silly and weak and eventually being corrected by the main hero  not that much4- main hero sudden power boosts and devising very bullshitsolutions to overcome story s so called most difficult challenges such as beating antagonist while struggling over trivial things  reference movie  prey    not that much5-constant virtue-signaling and acting upon silly ideals and still being accomplished  but being portrayed as real ideologist  not that much6- strong narration of a patriarchal white supremacist evil world  no
curious if you have read the codex sinaiticus
phylacteries  ten commandments  each placed in a tiny box and hung from the bottom of the garment  to remind the wearer what is the right thing to do.yahweh spoke to moses  saying   speak to the children of israel  and tell them that they should make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations  and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue  and itshall be to you for a fringe  that you may look on it  and remember all yahweh s commandments  and do them  and that you don  t follow your own heart and your own eyes  after which you use to play the prostitute  so that you may remember and do all my commandments  and be holy to your God.  numbers 15 37-40 web in matthew  Jesus not only pointed out that the pharisees did this  but exaggerated their phylacteries in a pretensions way to show how righteous they were  in opposition to their purpose.proselyte  the jewish equivalent of a Christian. someone who accepts the jewish faith and promotes judaism. its like evangelizing and preaching  but judaism. see acts 6 5 13 1. example in deuteronomy 21 10-14I recently started playing fortnite and had a problem getting character skins  which is a big deal in the community. one of the earliest skins was  lara croft   which I had heard about  but had never played any tomb raider games. I play thatskin exclusively  largely because she doesnt have tattoos  I dont care about other people  its not for me . then I realized the character is well known  even among kids today. I started researching the franchise and ended up here.
why do devs want to force everyone to play as androgynous  unattractive characters   if I wanted to play as an ugly character  I d just go outside...
it always grates on my nerves how the left drag their politics into the gaming world  we play games to get away from all that
unpopular opinion  I liked the new tomb raider games  for the most part.  there are problems I had with them  which sound much lke everyone else s  too easy  superhuman perception thing  not enough tomb raiding .  I didn t get much wokeness from them  either.  except for two things  jonas was hawaiian in the first one  black in the second one  and then hawaiian again in the third one  and the idea some 5 4  white girl could  blend in  with the security force of 6 0  brown men without raising alarms is ridiculous.oh  yeah  I couldn t stop looking at lara s ass in the third one.  also  Im not really religious  but its good to see melanie closes her videos with Bible quotes.  maybe the world isn t really trying to dive into satanism.
I like the new tomb raider games  but lara is too  girl next door .
concerning our status in relation to Christ   dont forget romans 8 16-17 16the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God  17and if children  heirs also  heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ  if indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him. as Christians  we are the apex of creation  capable even of any  miracle  within Gods will. 1 corinthians 11 11 be imitators of me  just as I also am of Christ.
I just gotta add my two cents to this because while I didn t play the original games  I did grow up seeing a lot of the original lara and I adored her.the reboot could have been better for a number of reasons Im sure we can all agree on that  however  I will say this in partial defense of that lara concept. to preface  this is based solely on the games  I have not read any of the comics or other materials. she seemed like the base start point to what would eventually become the lara croft we all know and love  should have been even at her early twenties a bit more hippy and busty but I digress on that.the problem obviously  was her character arc was all over the place  shadow s personality should have been in rise and vice-versa  and rise along with shadow should have been reflecting the seven stages of grief. eventually showing her properly coming into her own and by the end of shadow small but clear signs of the personality we see her have in tomb raider 1.this obviously didn t happen and Im kind of glad they didn t try to do a reboot of the first game utilizing the set-up personality they had from their prequel reboot.
0 54its current year...dont you know that your only allowed to have the correct opinion which changes everyday  covid
I can imagine you being bullied by bronies  for your personal opinions of my little pony  if you were to express love interest in that franchise. maybe something like  youre doing it wrong .
next title tomb raider dominates the sjw s
okay so... your channel and this video confuse me. tomb raider isn t  woke  Ive been a fan of itsince its beginnings andhave taken the good with the bad with the worst eidos and square enixhas released and I wouldn t call the reimaged version anything other than modernized graphically. if you want to play as the cartoony lara you can in tomb raider go  andtemple of  osiris. plus you can play shadow of the tomb raider as any ofthe old models as well. you ve also been able to set lara s look since thefirst tomb raider remake game. maybe not her hair and face but what shewears. I love my baba yaga lara and thats the only version I run around onwhen I play the game going total primal. I was happy as punch to find outthat outfit was included with shadow. I honestly didn t want my lara to lookany other way. I also have a mod that lets me play as angelina jolie if I want.is that not lara croft enough  I get it. you have your likes as far as how she looks. and I get it  looking at your room you have a cosplay thing going.but thats your thing. what we have is lara croft. period the end hahaits so irrelevant. I totally cant stand the last tomb raider movie but Imnot going around saying alicia vikander isn t lara croft. only angelina jolieis. thats a bit absurd haha so I just dont get your argument here.youre also looking through some rose colored glasses.the last of the  original  series before the remakes were awful hahathe franchise needed the remake. Imean if they were poised torelease a fourth installment and they made lara black or puerto ricanor something  then I could understand this. but in 2022 this topic has like zero relevancy. shouldn t we be talking about aloy and forbidden west since it justreleased
I respect your truth and you need to respect my truth but tbh Im offended for the way you marginalised the t-rex community and the frozen butler community in this video. Im offended on behalf of the dinosaur community and frankly you have no right to enjoy things and have preferences. how dare you enjoy a particular art style  do yourealise how many other art styles you ignore when you prefer something  how can you sleep at night  we must all equally be offended on behalf of somebody else and thats the ideal world. Im sure the oil on canvas community and pointillism community will be in an uproar after I drag this conversation into twitter with a heavily mis-represented tweet taken out of context later.
great video  but your key light is way too bright.
the og lara croft never appealed to me from tanky gameplay to overly booby design. my problem isn t when you make a more serious tomb raider. its when you tell me the character cant be sexualized.
I have got native american on both sides of the family  english  irish  and italian. - if people are offended by that well thatsounds like a personal problem.
haven t played any of the new tomb raider.  when a strong  sensible woman speaks  the left panics and get uber insecure.
I remember the 2017 movie reboot with a flat chested  flat assed  plain faced mary sue in the role and the woke media gushed  now thats lara croft!  it was a massive bomb on par with bros yet nobody got the message.
haha I am irish  scottish  british  and welch  and my wife is mexican and native american.  that makes my kids all kinds of mixed.  if anyone tells them they are not mexican and native because they have white blood  they can kiss my kids butts!  my boys have been raised to be happy in who they are.  no one is going to tell them they are bad people because of their  white  blood!
yesss
my understanding is that the general consensus was that alicia vikander was the best part of the movie.
@pyranders  except for the fact thatshe was flat as a board  had no facial expressions at all  looked nothing like croft and couldn t act to save her life.
@c g  yeah  they really should have hired su naing to play her  the resemblance is striking.
realism  is mostly an excuse. in horizon forbidden west its clear the character was redesigned to be butchier  more manly and to be purposefully a bit uglier. its not a massive difference but it is visible. this was covered up with claims to  realism   but female athletes dont all have manlier shoulders  pudgier faces etc. there s a subset of athletes that are top of their sports and also beautiful  so why not model an ideal heroine on that  an argument closer to truth is that media images influence society but this is not really the point.  if lara is too beautiful it causes eating disorders. it doesnt of course cause any girls to take care of their bodies  eat right  exercise etc  oh no no no no! no one is inspired with idealized beauty. people can only be despairing from it.  this is nonsense and not real reason. the real reason is progressive fashion to keep portrayals of women in media not offensive to karens. female beauty is just haram. out with it. now lizzo is pinnacle of female beauty  every single woman is equally as beautiful and desirable and karen can relax about competition.
one  one-hundred  fifty-tooth
the lgbtq community loves the feminine  badass  sassy ams sexy lara. there s not only straight males. there s a variety of people!
Ive only finished the first 3 minutes of the video  and although Im not a super big tomb raider fan  Ive seen all three movies and have played the majority of the ps2 game angel of darkness   I can see a major flaw with the whole argument of the video. youre upset because current lara isn t vlassic lara  but if Im not mistaken  thats kind of the point. its a reboot. a rebooted character shouldn t be the exact same as the previous version. thats about as stupid as expecting andrew garfield and tom holland to play versions of spider-man that  other than the change in actor  are indistinguishable from tobey maguire s spider-man in terms of personality.classic lara was hyper feminine. if Im not mistaken  thats the same as being an oversexualized woman. and Im pretty sure women are the ones who are constantly complaining about women being oversexualized. so forgive me for being confused by your statement. either way  whether current lara were to be oversexualized or not  it wouldn t change her personality  unless you think their oversexualization is their personality  in which case you have literally no argument .and again  thats just from the first 3 minutes of the video. there might be a lot more later on.edit after seeing the whole video.... there wasn t much of an argument other than thatshe wasn t oversexualized anymore. you seemed to not care that her actual personality was different  so my example of the different spider-men is now irrelevant. however  itseems your argument is still very much about the oversexualization of lara  or lack thereof. which isn t a good argument at all. Imean  aren t women all for body positivity  isn t it all about being powerful and confident no matter what you look like  Imean most women I feel dont really understand body positivity  or completely misuse the idea   but still.also  ignoring the fact the new lara is part of a rebooted canon  these new stories are also an origin story. meaning that if you wanted  you could have your own headcanon that these new games take place before the old games  and that lara has yet to utilize her  assets   which she shouldn t  because that is an extremely toxic thing and shouldn tbe encouraged .even further still  quoting the Bible to support your opinion of wanting lara to be oversexualized didn t much help your case  and it was a very unsmart move. for one  Im an atheist  so obviously the quote meant nothing to me  as literally all Christians are hypocrites  the very thing this quote is shrowing shade at   but the Bible also supports your view of women... I guess. stay at home wifes that clean and take care of the children  not to seek success for themselves  let alone be encouraged to do so  and that they are to be the prize of their husbands  something that can be shown off like an object.
can youreact to lara croft angel of darkness remake  he s using konrad model un that game
if colonialism was wrong  then its wrong for wealthy white producers to require black actors to wear british folklore clothing and speak with british accents  while they simultaneously refuse to create more authentic characters based on african mythologies.
8 59 much better than aloy
Im sorta mixed  does that count  Im half-white  half-depressed.
I would like the sexy lara returns
land o  lakes  they removed the native american and kept the land and lakes.

I dont play any of the new tomb raider game. they keep changing her.
yeah lara croft is a hot bad ass.
this just popped up after square enix sold many ips including tr is just so funnywhat s screwed up is that they probably did it to pursue nfts which is just sad and pathetic.
thanks for your comments
5 38  thats ruby rose
tolkienism
tbh I have no idea whats going on here.
Im mixed too but I got the most pale skin ever people dont believe me when I say Im part black  part caribbean indigenous and part spanish. there is a lot of racism against whites and white looking people nowadays and its sad to see that its coming from white people too.
wait  are these mods
we love biracial peeps
I hate non sexy lara ....I just play the remake trilogy more than the reboot series altho I still love all of them and also been playing them for over 2 decades lol
the lara croft today is a great character. just not  at all  a great lara croft character.
fun fact  confident women are more attractive
im tired of the erasure of women .
now lara is a feminist too
preach
savage Jesus is savage. lol.
cool chick!
they dont like you because you are mixed. as far as I know everyone is mixed somewhere. we are all related and we all have common ancestors. does that mean they hate all latin caribbean people who are a mix of indigenous  african  and white  I have never seen your chanel  this video came up. consider me a subscriber.
Im not a huge fan of tomb raider  plus I only loved one of the games and even Im like wtf
geeez my dad is half irish native american yooo
she reads the Bible too
I like your work but its cute that you think youre on an open platform.
so wokies can get over it lol! as if they have the emotional maturity to do so.majority english german native
is this chick like the mocap for laura or the va or face model or something
yeeeeeessssss!!!
Im not sure if you ve already looked it up  but a proselyte  in the biblical context  is a new convert to a religion  according to google  so take that with a grain of salt.
male characters are allowed to be sexy  but not female characters. its extremely hypocritical  and frankly  unfair.     I d like to give some genuine advice  I d start moving away from twitter  if you can. its a complete septic tank where civil discourse goes to die.
melonie I like the reboot games gameplay story ok I like the original games better
pharisees - wokies
oh yeahh !!!!
original lara croft was sexy and badass  that was her confidence  her strength and it made her cool  she had sass and was a tease  like she was unattainable yet forward. she was in your face and a bit cocky. beautiful  but deadly  like a tiger  that was lara croft. new lara is ok  but she s so bland  self-serious  very emo without any style. she s boring.
remember  if the woke are not offended youre doing it wrong
uploading on the Lord s day. for shame!
love your channel  but I cannot sub to it

there s only one race that matters  human.
dev s sjw media  we want to make lara into a man so women will like her woman  I kinda liked her how she was  the new lara is crappy dev s sjw media   stfu woman! you will like what we tell you to like
the mob is pissed because women in games were prettier than them  so they rallied to ugly up game characters so they dont feel bad about themselves.
04 46 very nice indeed but...swimsuit with jeans and leather jacket doesnt make much sense
people wearing japanese stuff just recognize the japanese are the master race. lol. Im just an american dutch boy. hahaha!
15 39  Im going to make a retelling remake of roots where kunta kente was white. hope no one has a problem.

k kid that is prime unwoke lara not ps1
there is no new tomb raider coming out soon apart from the mobile game. which I will be playing  I already did a preview of it on my other channel when I had early access
@melonie mac go boom
the next james bond will be a woman and the next lara croft will be a man. we desperately need john spartan to show up and soon.
man  when is crystal dynamics going to make another legacy of kain game and stop making all these tomb raider games
tomb raider was good until the jolie movies were made.
I dont hate on u.. I think I love u .. haha lol nah but u are gorgeous
de nada
the modern lara croft is a empty shell of the pure tomb raider heroine of the 90s 3rd person action genre  she s no longer the well endowered  duel gungfu slinging  agile  adventure seeking femme fatale counterpart to indiana jones that wonthe hearts n minds of every man n women who grew in the 5th gen era. the fairy-dust snorting spiv heads over a enix reduced her to nothing but a overgrown brat whose personality shrank along with her bust size failing to even reach a low hanging branch less five feet or cut or shoot a bunch of crates suspended by a piece a of rope. she s nothing but a freak whaling air-raid siren every time shit hits the fan comparison to the original lara who d just serve up a silver platter of 9mm bullets from her duel sidearms w a cool maniacal grin thats lara croft!
I legitimately have no idea what the pc way to describe myself is at this point  the rhetoric is utterly stupid.
mel you delete my comment  it was clearly a sarcastic joke.. always try to comment to help boost the videos you put out and support you  rip
those shadow outfits were terrible. lol
I  identify  as a klingon so the wokies have to respect that.
new laura is an abomination  and the developers should be ashamed of themselves.
im  irish  german  and native american  and my general opinion on this matter is one  were americans  two make a good God dammed story I dont give a shit about cultural apropriation!
nobody is one thing.  Im czech  german  english  irish.  it means nothing.  we are humans.  we are not monoliths.
19.7  20on wensday
nah boomie  stick with your guns. the only losing move with the cards in your hand is to fold.if the mob wants to be on the aggressive  you too dont try to be nice and say  new lara is fine.  she sucks  and let your voice be heard. give them something to reaaaally be mad about.
that first one is hilariously bad.
cant beat unwoke ps2 and ps3 prime lara I criticize alicia vikander role on youtube ofcourse comment got deleted that wont fly on woke recent arrived z nation ones sjw angelina jolie always is prime lara until someone better comes
o
I think the wokeness is just a fad that will eventually fade  just like the hippies some decades ago  or the emos.
opinions are cool but. I dont feedback
I dont delete comments  its youtube s filter system. Im gonna a disable this when I get back home  Im visiting family
@melonie mac go boom  ahhh I feel silly now! its probably because I put a asciI picture of a troll face hidden bellow the  read more  button to be fair..enjoy your family visit!thank you for the content and the clarification on the comment!
they unsub me I am back now
Im a tomb raider fan since I was a kid  tomb raider underworld was my favorite. at this point I dont care about these libs feelings Im attacking them.
open minded  hhmmm not quite
hugs
imagine still thinking  woke  sells. it blows my mind how this stupid narrative keeps being the main focus of this big corporation s.
philactries were boxes they would wear that would be lists of torah verses they memorized.
imo the reboot lara croft is a female ripoff of uncharted s nate drake!!
imagine if somebody made a movie about masaaI tribe in kenya and half of the people in the tribe were white. Imean what the fuck.
interesting  first few days you d have 700-1000  upvotes and 0 downvotes  now the downvotes have startedyou always have to wonder the proportion of downvotes are people only clicking your video to hit the  thumbs down
big ol mutt here canuck  native american  italian  etc... agree completely. esp about pharisees.
just like a big corporation to get rid of the indian  but keep the  land .
6 15 that would be perfect
nerds get angry on the internet about your lara croft opinions  ya dont say
based
what s with the Bible stuff at the end
if playstation and xbox censor games you want to play  stop buying those platforms.  buy a pc where you wont be censored.
what is it with super religious people using the term  woke  all the time
start going on rumble. u know you will get canceled here sooner than later
rhianna pratchett ruined lara croft. they hired her to make a feminist version of lara for young girls who dont want to see a large chest on a female. you can read all about it on google. how when she was young she didn t want to play because lara was so sexualized. so she got hired there and changed it. thanks goodness she doesnt work there anymore and I hope the real lara returns.
so weird how now its  sexist  to have woman look like woman in games
meh new lara looks great
in before lara becomes a gay black man.
tomb raider   yamato was a realy good reboot .. revival of the franchise  with a great origin story culminating in the iconic pose and characterthen they made that game again and again .... same storry diffrent setting.....................just how many coming of age story can one character have  on a  full history  vid they included some of the comics in the  new line ................ ho ... I want to puke !!!
the first tomb raider remake reboot was great but she just kept getting uglier. I would love for the fan look to return. itsucks because I love the gameplay  better than uncharted.
the next iteration of lara croft will be a black lesbian amputee. also who identifies as a man.
why do you  respect the devs   they dont like  care about or respect you.
you had me at lara. lost me at Bible bashing.
a proselyte is a new convert to a religion.
proselyte pretty much means youre a person that has converted your opinion  religion or party from one to another.
I think its pretty simple  you like it  you consume it. you dont like it  you dont consume it. end of story. vote with your wallets.I cannot understand the entitlement of the ones who want already established ips to be changed in order to be more inclusive  for which I have to say  its not yours. stop whining.I cannot understand the entitlement of the ones who want already established ips to be completely unchanged  for which I have to say  its not yours. stop whining.the moment you identify yourself with an ip and becomes sooo important that people engage in such discussions  the problem lies then in the person whose personality is so weak that cant take that his beloved character changes or not changes.the argument of   creators own their fans a certain degree of wish fulfillment  because we are the ones who support supported it  is completely wrong because you can always stop supporting that creator  so there s no contract here. stop whining  stop crying.liket it  buy it. dont like it  dont buy it.
everything woke turns to shit.
welcome to the land of getting tired of the bs plz disrespect  the woke they are nothing more then adult babies
------- no one cares if you are cute -----
comment to stop the commies
I think cultural appropriation is frowned upon because the ppl of the culture are not giving permission. its just europeans putting on the look and then integrating. thats just rude. I was watching someone play hitman and he s the only white man in india but nobody notices him. Im like really. I told the player I would have shot her for lurking. in game of course but you get my point. I think smiggy should be in game and give permission for non indigenous ppl to dress like his ppl. like  here put this on if you want to fit in . its the object of not seeking social acceptance is what bothers some indigenous ppl. its like europeans can go and do whatever they want to do and no one should say anything about it.
to me  lara croft isnt feminin at all  and was never.
so what if you hurt someone s feelings. these snowflakes need to grow up and appreciate that their opinion isn t the only one that counts. everybody in the world is entitled to their opinion. if youre a snowflake and someone else s opinion upsets you  tuff! I suppose we should be grateful they haven t yet made lara croft a black lesbian with a woke agenda and changed the name to patriarchy raider.
meow
I cant find this weird  woke  version of lara  can someone point me in the right direction
ok kid no surprise there

@tj heitor  can you use english  and its not little anime girl
I am a Christian - I was reading scripture not bashing it
@melonie mac go boom  what does it have to do with lara
from the 2013 game onward. in essence  the first game was serviceable as an origin story  though it was weird that they messed with her accent and took away her childhood of being ridiculously wealthy   but they walked back most of her character development and left her a mopey twig with daddy issues rather than a confident thief who raided tombs to steal their shit.
@vherstinae altheiris  oh  I thought this was about a brand new thing
@leon russell  it kind of is  since the devs are claiming they want to  unify  the two game chronologies and have also spent their time insulting old-school lara and saying how anyone who likes her old look and personality is a bad person.
I watched this because it was about tr. turned out to be a ridiculous list of Bible quotes.
wokeness is just... augh! ok we re all made up of different elements of different races. if you ve got english ancestry its a given that your part scot part irish part dane part viking... go back far enough you ve probably got a roman legionary in there somewhere. there is nothing wrong with claiming that. there is nothing wrong with  identifying with the constituent parts that make you up as a whole or with claiming all aspects of your identity. admittedly going back 2000 years may be a bit impractical. being woke started out as  promoting equality but in recent years it feels like its metastasizing into some kind of purity obsession. separating out  elements of our collective culture   sounds a bit right wing doesnt it   if youre not 100  this thing you cannot claim to be this thing   you are not appropriating a culture if its your bloody culture!
well  its not really  a mob   just a noisy handful of soyboys. I dont know if you guys have this saying in english   dogs bark as the caravan passes by .
just the word  woke  is so cringe inducing the crap they preach is not new in any way shape or form! the 60 s and the 70 s say  hi! and btw  those movements had more substance than the fake virtue signaling or  female  empowerment they preach nowadays  is not original or new it was old 10 years ago just stop please please!
thing is lara was always a woman  in the rebot she was an early 20 something idealistic activist type. grow the f up  the original lara was wiping out endangered species and killing in cold blood because she wants shiny thing.
who are you and why are you in my recommendations  I dont care abt lara croft. Im averse to religion. Im korean. anyway. cheers - -b
calling identity like it is some sort of rank is just redicules. but Im from europe so what do I know about weird english speaking culture bullshit
dont you ever be afraid to speak your opinion .
lara croft was too sexy and her body is unrealistic  and it leads to women being degraded and depressed about their figure....but hey did you see them swipe the clothes off thor in his new movie while the women enjoy and joke about it   totally fine... and it is fine  just using it as an example of double standard
not gonna lie  im not particularly upset with the design of the knew lara croft as an athletic female design  she comes off as an attractive athletic woman id expect to be able to go do woodland shit. however its not lara. laras a sexed up rich girl grave robbing indiana jones type. she gos on adventures  finds treasure  bangs hot dudes  and wears skimpy clothes while fighting dinosaurs and raiders. she also always kinda looked more mature like she might be mid to late 20s early 30s where as the knew lara looks like shes like 18 to 25.
Imiss the old lara. Imean the new games are enjoyable in their own ways but lara just feels like a generic feminist character now. woke sjw writing is so bland and boring and the characters these types of people create aren t much better
pardon my boldness  looking at you I see america the beautiful in all of its splendor irish native american whatever brought you here you are the great mystery of not being entirely one or the other that mystery celebrates america God bless you
1st
I am white and I absolutely hate all this woke shit. whenever I tell people that Im part native americanthey get supremely offended  so Im right there with you girl.
12 12 what does indigenous mean  indigenous from aftrica  australia  south america  Im indigenous to america. you need to be more specific in your twatter rants. and what is cultural appropriation  you mean like cars and electricity  because Im offended.
what  the  devs  have communicated to you that they have issues with you voicing your opinion  come again    what devs  this would be more than just completely unacceptable  no matter what game or which studio.
sorry  I just dont get it  were you born in island  if not then your american  I dont get this maddening trend Im african american no  no! youre either american or african look at me  I have viking and saxon and french in my essential tree but am I a viking french saxon english man  hell no  Im an english man  it makes no sense to me why people say this is maddening. there is only 1 true african american I know of he is a comedian his father was a british diplomat the day he was born he was born the border to the american embassy and africa now he can call himself a true african american because he was born in both nations. unless this happens to you  you are just wako! sorry if I offended you  but other than this makes no sense to me.
every one should stop worrying about offending people. you will never be able to make every one happy. stop trying. say what you please and chuckle as the red faced people storm out in a huff. the world will be a better place with that kind of freedom to speak.
wow a girl saying new lara croft is woke  !!!is this a dream  !!!thank you finally someone understands she looks baaaaad and her personality and voice actor are so annoying hated the new trilogy hated her manly features
all I know is  lara croft used to look seriously female  and I thought she was sexy. not anymore.
ireland is one of my favorite places in the world I would love to see your response to visiting there....especially the places and people  Ive known there..coleraine westport..newry special places in my heart
it isnt woke...
ever consider that they might be doing just that
how is lara croft woke  she s the least woke character in gaming history  o
lies Jesus was not perfect he had flaws just like the rest of us
because women cant be athletic  sexy or feminine. if youre going to have curves its from weighing as much as a van.  body positivity  is all about being fat and unhealthy. Im not going to mock you for being fat  but I am going to call you out for your hypocrisy. and just to be clear   you  as in  general you   not specifically youreading this.
I was wondering the same thing
he was literally perfect  that was the whole point of him coming to earth. to live perfect and fulfill the law so he could be sacrificed for us. now if you mean appearance thats different  the Bible says he was not attractive.
none of the new iterations have been fat or unhealthy. they ve made her look less like a contender for the guinness world record for the world s thinnest waist  and I dont see how thats a bad thing.
