frodo just fell to the one ring again.
the biggest problem with rings of power is the fact its just their version of how they think Lord of the rings should be. its not adding new things its recycling them in their own  interpretation and liberties  but with wanting to ride off the back of peter jackson by keeping many of the same designs  sauron  fellbeast  balrog etc . instead what they should have done is introduce and explore new places like harad  rhun  umbar etc. places where there are pocs with interesting lore just waiting to mined.
it truly breaks my heart to see the actors of the beloved characters from the lotr movies come out and do this. they dont get it or maybe they re just worried about getting cancelled for not saying anything in support of it. who knows. I just know Im very disappointed in them.
we wouldn t be frustrated with rings of power if they just respected the lore and tolkien s legacy. also nice 5fdp hoodie.
I love the smell of corporate desperation.
yeah no  this isn t winning any jackson trilogy fans over  just seems like amazon is trying to take down as many people as possible with them. at the very least sir ian mckellen and vigo have tried to distance themselves  staying safe from the influence of the dark Lord.
actors are spokes people for the studio that employ them. if an actor wants work  they have to do as they are told.
speaking of race swapping and black people I am black and am a huge janes bond fan.  I balked and almost started a junta  joking about the junta  when it was announced that they were thinking of casting idris elba as james bond.  dont get me wrong  until the most recent crap he has been pulling  I actually was a fan of idris elba  but james bond   sorry  but reading the source material  there is nothing about him thatscreamed  black   and it would have been a disservice to the 007 franchize to have cast him as such.  this will be just as bad or even worse than when they cast either george lazenby or pierce brosnan.  james bond is british white.  people need to het over it.  if they wanted a black british spy  it could have been a spin-off  like 009 or something.
so much for having respect for tolkien and the accuracy of lore! apparently loyalty and respect have both a time-limit and a price-tag...
sigh......I cant believe the four hobbits are simping for this woke dumpster fire......just........ugh. I absolutely love your five finger death punch hoodie  its an s-tier looking hoodie! your makeup and hair is on point and you look stunning!
elijah wood recently admitted in an interview that he still hasn t finished reading the classic j.r.r. tolkien fantasy novel that the peter jackson film trilogy is based on.in order to cancel  the cancel culture  we have to remind all the actors that  your job is to entertain me  not to lecture me
great content melonie. very sad to see. it just hammers home that most cast members dont have a clue when it comes to the source material. just look at chris hemsworth. admitted he read half a thor issue once when he first signed on to thor and never picked another up. that  to me speaks volumes given how he was happy to help run the character into the ground by the time of love and thunder  when continued to be paired with an awful  egomaniac frontrunner  taika  I ll ruin your mythos in a minute  baby  waititI  given free reign to bury thor in the latest movie  who had replaced earlier ones who would respect the lore  brannagh  for example  who did thor 1  and lead hemsworth  since he clearly had no clue of the actual character outside of what he was being told to act like  towards representing thor closer to how he should be.
evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt and ruin good forces have invented or made
episode 1  rings of power has a white guy in a pub tell the first black elf  when are you people going to let the past go ! what writer  editor  director and producer ever thought that was a good idea ! they all reviewed it. it just highlights their own racial bias. they could have said anything and chose to ignore it. they wrote racist words.
thats what I love about you mac  always keeping things and dont shy away from potential controversial topics
poor frodo. I expect this from merry and pippin but not mr. frodo. you look beautiful mel.
nothing warms my heart more than seeing beloved movie stars support a multi-billion dollar international company. you cant make me cry!  sniff
all criticism is ist   phobe the show is boring  poorly written and doesnt follow the lore.
just got yourself a new sub with this video. common sense and logic is  flowing from your mouth like water.
is elijah sucking the life force out of his hobbit co-stars
rofl
@melonie mac go boom  damn  haven t seen  rofl  in a long ass time  xd
we all knew sam was the og all along anyway
@envix  sean asting also simped for rop
@razoro2productions  u right  I just found the picture of him wearing the hat. you know one thing I noticed is that none of them are smiling in their pictures. you see frodo mary pippin try to crack a smile with their mouth  but their eyes dont match. and sam doesnt even try to smile.
and the ring will seduce and betray him as well.
cultural marxism is all about that.
its a ip to push the message. its a skin suit to push the message.
its more  inspired by  tolkiens work rather than being middle earth. the show has remarkably bad scripting and acting for the amount of money they ve spent on it. it isolation  the show is a mediocre fantasy show  it is only if you expect it to be a tolkien show that is is bad.
absolutely spot on. but they are lazy hacks targeting the  who cares   crowd
@p. b ckman  nah  its still bad as a generic fantasy show. as a tolkien-based show its an atrocity.
that would require actual creative capabilities and writing. evil cannot create anything new.
they want everyone to have the same opinion   f that  they can cry if they cant handle criticism. they can always just leave the usa  go to north korea or russia where you cant have opinions..
anyone upset that a fantasy show has ethnic people needs mental help.
long short   rings of power is a shytty fan-fic based on footnotes of source material without taking the source material seriously.
with horrendous writing
never meet your heroes
its unfortunate but to be fair Im pretty sure the actors didn t give a shit about what tolkien actually thought in the jackson movies either. I get leaving things out like the scouring of the shire  or ol  tom bombadil  but some of the changes to the characters are less forgiving... Imean faramir and aragorn are kinda unrecognizable.
they re all part of the same club. mention the club s name and you get shadowbanned or deleted from yt. guess how I know
I think they are just out of the loop and only hear things from amazons pov
fear of backlash   also brownie points .
they are just actors  paid to play roles. there is no requirement to even like the role they agree to play as long as they do it well. on what planet would you expect an actor to care about a 20 year old role in a movie
they re just actors who played roles you liked years ago. why did you have any expectations of them one way or the other
@squaeman _  faramir  absolutely. what s the issue with aragorn though  personally  the character change they made that I disliked the most was making gimlI into comic relief.
@aaron humphrey  aragorn they turned into an unwilling king. in the books aragorn isn t unwilling  but just a king in waiting. he s sort of the old school masculine archetype like conan or geralt. they also screwed up theoden a little come to think of it.
@squaeman _  its been a long time since I watched it  but I remember him being more hesitant than unwilling. overall I thought aragorn was pretty spot on in the movies  though that was a needless change no doubt.
probably the worst excuse for a band ever lols
@aaron humphrey  yeah thats my gripe  they felt needless. I do love viggo mertenson though...
@aaron humphrey  because back in that time no one thought like this. there was an expectation of normalcy then that we dont see or have much anymore. its all being redefined. what was normal then is now considered racist and bigotry now when it never was. they dont get it. the criticism for this show has nothing to do with racism or bigotry. it has to do with the failure to respect tolkien s work by changing it for the sake of modernity and representation.
I agree. you think you know people... ofc  that is a silly thing to say  because you ve only ever seen them on screen  but thats how it feels.
@m strikesback  same club  I think I get what you mean mayhe Im being dumb lol. but any way you could explain
eh we put actors actresses celebs on a pedestal too much. they re just actors at the end of the day  I loved the hobbit performances in the movies  but I could care less about their real world beliefs.
their the smart ones. ian mckellen never bashes the fans.
@sean obrien  there are no words to describe how much I love that man. he  as the actor who played gandalf in the work of a very catholic man  is basically a living testament to the exact opposite of all the current ideology around the role of actors. he s also just really awesome!
heard gimlI s actor called it out from the start as nothing but a cash grab...here s hoping they lose money
@mr. s  come to think of it  I do think I remember something like that. pretty sure he was on a few interviews on aussie tv talking about it  but he mainly diverted it to talk about how much he loved tolkien s material and how he adored his time with the jackson team. and a lil bit of shannara here and there. he definitely wasn t in support of the show though
me  a jackson trilogy fan  in the corner of a back room  whispering  I love it
agreed  to me it d be like recasting blade or black panther with mark wahlberg or some shit. I dont wanna see that. an artist created these characters  they re awesome as is and thats why they became popular.  leave them as is. but hey  what do I know.
@reaper4640  yeah exactly. why is it okay to swap them into black people  but never the reverse
it would be like making a mulan movie with a non-asian cast.
exactly  it would be like casting tom cruise for blade
and btw  why do they not give a s    about the asians
@omega rasetsu     you are like the majority of people -- regardless of their own race or color -- who just want to see legacy characters left the way they were.   warning  mini-rant initiated...   when the word  misogyny  started getting bantered about a few years ago  it really tripped my trigger. I saw both the terminator and terminator 2  judgment day in cinemas. I also saw alien and aliens in cinemas.  yeah  I am a boomer.    I was  rooting for  the characters of sarah connor and ellen ripley to  triumph . I was not -- and am not -- a misogynist! and to have that accusation thrown around willy-nilly an insult to say the least. mini-rant concluded...
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   you are an older gen-xer.  I am gen-x also.I am absolutely against all of the woke shyt.  and you want to know a secret   if I had identified with a character all my life  it was wolverine.  yeah  a black guy who didn t identify with bishop  or any of the other black side characters who come in and out.  nope  good old logan  dirty claw  wolverine.  I generally identify with persona and character role.  I grew up in detroit  and always was the smallest kid in class  and often got bullied until the day I snapped  I was about 10 or 11   and henceforth I began beating the snot out of the bullies to the point that when I was 12  I had 6 or 7 other kids jump me  and we all had a hospital visit at the end of it.my point is  I find it weird when people say that they want someone look like them be a character.  what about your personality   you can look like me  but I can also not like or relate to the person that you are.
@omega rasetsu      rodger all that... btw  I am a boomer...
I just find it weird how people can get riled about a fictional world which black people who are casted to play as fictional characters in this fantasized world of middle earth where there s no such thing as ethnic races at all. why in the real world do people have to assimilate their ideals of race into a fantasy where that concept doesnt exist  in worlds like this you can kind of compare it to skyrim where the races make up elves  dwarves  orcs  arogonian  nord  man . the race card is definitely being played in this whole situation. and here I thought color didn t matter.
@triumphalism est 69  due to the fanciful world of  they look like me  therefore I can see myself in this character   opposed to  this character by his her actions reminds me of myself .  again  I identify with wolverine and I am black.  I see myself when I look at old logan dirty claw....  his attitude  his worldly knowledge  his  Im the best at what I do  and what I do  ain t pretty ....  sure  blade is a cool character  but his methods and attitude as well as his personality....  if we knew each other we probably wouldn t get along very well  even without the vampire crap.  lolthe point is the same with that little mermaid crap   people just believe that if the character looks like them  they magically identify with that character.  which is superficial at best  and at worst childish.
they did it for the money.  somebody pulled out a checkbook.  nobody was fooled.
@allan  a.k.a. rockiteman   you were born before 1964
@omega rasetsu      yes. believe it or not  some of us are still around...
@p. b ckman  but mulan plays in a historical setting. thats not the same I think
@the searcher  he was making the point about race swapping  and the fact that the bbc casted a black actress to play as anne boleyn  second wife of henry viii.....  savvy
@the searcher    the  historical  part of mulan is highly dubious  but what about hidden dragon  crouching tiger  again  how would it look if one insisted on having european characters in some of the roles
plus cool hoodie. its good to see you back at it. but I dont want the negativity to bring you down. remember praying for ya and we got your back melonie.
bad casting choice to top it all off
so happy to hear you ll be back on fnt!!! also would love to see you bring back the verse of the day.
this series was doomed to failure from the moment it was announced. its kinda sad they coaxed both elijah wood and sean astin into this shit. xd
they paid him and offered him a new show down the road.
with the way they were standing  if one of them held up a sigh saying  amazing is holding us hostage please send help  I wouldnt be surprised
someone remake fresh prince of bel air and do race swaps and lets see what happens.
well said! the question now is how much were they paid  honestly  its sad to see!
this is an exact repeat of the kenobI attempt to blame the fans
and I absolutely love that youre go to be back on friday night tights!!!!! yay!!!!!
no wonder gandalf was mad at them in the 1st movie in that cave scene  as he would say   fool of a took  next time throw yourself in and rid us of your stupidty.
I cant support the movie directly mr frodo but I can carry it  by wearing this cap.
I think amazon knows its going very very bad.  in my area  south florida  amazon is no longer showing the rop banner on the main amazon page.even the main prime video page which has 8 different sliding banners  none of them are for rop!  its as if amazon has just given up.
just another pr deflection by amazon  anything to change focus from creative decisions  writing and acting. looking forward to seeing you on fnt again!
I just want to put on the ring and turn invisible so the amazon orcs cant force to watch this.
first things first  fantastic hair today  or whenever this was recorded . amazon has a lot of money to throw around so its not surprising that they can pay people to do things like this.also  just wanted to follow up on my post from a few months back saying that you inspired me to get healthier. I have hit my weight loss goal  down 20    but the journey isn t over  is it ever   now it is now time to start focusing on building the muscle. I should probably get personal trainer as I tend to be rather lazy with exercise.
I hope amazon s paying him good money for this.oh  and awesome five finger death punch hoodie.
they aren t simpimg for amazon  yet  they are just expressing that the tolkien fandom and middle earth is a welcoming space never before people have been rejected in it because of skin color
hey melonie I just wanted to say that I hope you had a wonderful and great blessed weekend with your brother and your family over the weekend and I hope you had a great safe trip back home. anyway I just want to make a comment about this video and that I think that elijah wood was not great character in the movie but was okay character on Lord of the rings movie series and I think that they were trying to make itsame thing like ring of power but couldn t bc it was too early in the years before the Lord of the ring was popular and famous and so that is why they were trying to make it to be like it was at the same time and same year of Lord of the rings was produced  ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment about this video and I just want to tell you that welcome back home and hope you had a great time with your family over the weekend. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
looks like frodo didn t get rid of the ring after all.
amazon is really going all-in at this point...I saw this the other day and I was like   do they know that we know what they re trying to do here  .because I genuinely think they dont.
to be fair  many of them haven t been relevant for a very long time. they re probably desperate for any publicity at this point. plus most of the cast of the original movies were very much involved with  the message  but jackson at least had the good sense to put his political ideology aside to stay  mostly  true to the story.
well maybe they ll learn the hard way by getting dragged down with it.
hi.  we re amazon.  would you say you like rop for a million dollars   no.  would you pretend you like rop for... a klondike bar   no.  ok. would you lie that you like rop for... one billion dollars !  sure.
had heard about sean supporting  other than a video where he said that we shouldn t be worried about the source material being changed  since they cant actually change what tolkien wrote..which I agree with.
the whole premise of fresh prince is a black family in a rich waite neighborhood
@dom  then just swap it to a poor white family in a rich black neighborhood
I doubt elijah is getting paid an influencer rate. he probably got amazon execs to sign a contract agreeing do distribute his next horror film.
someone made a good comment on the post  that it looks like the start of an orc s collection of severed ears. this should have had it designed like it was a necklace lol.
Im glad Christopher lee isn t alive to see this.
grab some of that gfuel before you watch. I almost fell asleep 20 minutes in to episode 1. haven t bothered with the rest. love the five finger death punch hoodie.
I want you to build a colossal tower of gfuel tubs.
you are all welcome ear  I cant believe they made thatshirt and didn t get creative with it.
glad you are on friday night tights I love the g g crew
rings of power fan   elijah  thank you so much for supporting lotr  the rings of power with your t-shirts. tell me  what do you think of amazon s tv show so far  elijah wood   wait... amazon made a lotr tv show
hey melonie Im glad to see you had another interesting topic.as always you had done another wonderful video. takecare melonie
the show s only been out for a week! this is totally coordinated. not grass roots at all. c mon!
keep em  comin
first  melonie  youre looking great! I know  stop simping.second  amazon really needs to stop  its past the point of being embarrassing. amazon  show a bit of grace and just take the  l !
Im gonna stay as far away from this as possible  pretend it doesnt exist  and hope that the anime is really good.
why has everything today have to be a huge hit ...
those t shirts and caps would have been made months ago. first they would have to be designed then a print on demand account set up then they would have to get the original lotr actors to model them. it would take at least 3 months at least in my estimation but I could be wrong. this came together too fast in my opinion.
he s aware that  you are all welcome   includes critics of the show  right
amazon has been taking ls left and right with its new branches of business. its entertainment branch has been failing constantly starting with video games. they  pulled out a multiplayer game from public beta and you haven t been able to play it in years and their latest game new world is not doing particularly well either.
haha Im just looking forward to peter jacksons anime movie next year the real prequel to the movies haha   also you look adorable melonie love the fingers just out of your sleeves its cute. good vid.
this shit bums me out.  I dont want them getting the original actors involved.. idk want to know how woke these people are.  I want to preserve my memory of them without being tainted with bs.
didn t he meet tolkien
@mano z  probably. he also played saruman in the peter jackson trilogy. guys been around for ever so I d be surprised if he hadn t met tolkien.
@mano z  he did. the only cast to do so.
not a bad idea for a shirt lol  they should ve hired you instead
most of the whole cast were extreme  progressives  for the jackson trilogy. if you look it up  ian mckellen is constantly talking about  the message  wherever he goes. the difference is peter jackson was able to keep himself and thus the cast in check until  the hobbit.
@ratatoskr  my day is now ruined.
its unfortunate but to be fair Im pretty sure the actors didn t give a shit about what tolkien actually thought in the jackson movies either. I get leaving things out like the scouring of the shire  or ol  tom bombadil  but some of the changes to the characters are less forgiving...
after they spent most of the year bashing the old cast and putting out articles thatsaid things like  elijah who   nobody has self respect in hollywood lol
selling out like that one episode of lost where dominic monaghans character sells out his band on a baby commercial.
they still work in hollywood so they are just bending the knee to avoid getting blacklisted  at least thats my guess. this amazon series is very disrespectful to tolkien s story and characters. when that guy-ladriel chick said   what would I be without it   referring to her sword  I was pretty shocked. the real galadriel is so much more than a swordsman. the show writers clearly dont understand that character in the slightest.
I already knew rings of power was gonna be doomed from the beginning... it was already controversial before it came out...
totally unrelated to this but been looking on your instagram and on my word!  cant believe you are 35 as you look nowhere near it.  and Im 33 by the way.  anyway  in regards to this.  I laughed out loud when I found out about this a few days ago.  I love the movie trilogy but lost some respect for the actors now with them doing this.
they honestly chose the wrong fan base to give something mediocre to.
the simps of power
the post comments on twitter is just wow. I was hoping the original actors would disapprove of the show considering what happened with peter jackson
cant believe he wouldn t wear wigs.
really interesting. I wonder if the same happened to ewan mcgregor. the producers told him people aren t liking obI wan kenobI simply because there s a black woman character. specially considering he s an old man and browsing on the internet may not be a big part of his day.
how long has itsauroman bought you  what was the promised price  elijah
never forget that  as plato used to say  acting is the same as lying and feigning. if you make a living out of it  you cant possibly be a serious individual.
to discover that certain actors are willing to shill for money is not really all thatsurprising.  it is a paycheck.  what would be foolish is to pay it any mind.  it is just actors  well  acting.
its sad when elijah wood and the other actors start bashing the fandom.
honestly  Im all for it.  they re using capitalism to push a message thats actually at least positive on its surface.  I dont remember any drow in the books  though   sure  they could probably exist  but we need an explanation on wtf happened to that one elf thats just a game of  which one of these is not like the others    on the easiest difficulty setting.  what s his story   it ain t genetics  unless he s a half-elf   is that even possible for tolkien s elves   my working theory is that he was cursed by sauron to be shunned by his people  but he didn t realize that they re not that focused on skin tone.  wait  is sauron a leftist   has to leave his mark everywhere he goes  just to signal to his cohorts he was there.  shows his own racism by accusing others of it.  seems to be fueled purely by hatred.  has an insatiable need to destroy everything thats good...  Im convinced.  sauron truly represents the worst humanity has to offer   liberalism.
lotr in ten years be like   gondorian border control is racist. orcs go through so much to come to gondor  and they re all future doctors and engineers.
I ll do it for a check too if I was in their shoes.
Ive seen several shows that had pocs back in the 90s. here s a handful of examples right here saved by the bellsister sisterkenan   kelthe desmonds the pjs - short-lived  yes  but itstill countsa relatively more recent example from closer to the 2000s - how about yu-gi-oh! gx season 3  axel brody anyone I imagine there were plenty more back then. in any case  if the Lord of the rings  rings of power is any good  and not defacing the legacy of the original author and his work  then perhaps there s still hope for them. Im personally not fussed either way - but fans evidently can see right through procuders trying too hard in one direction or another. . . .idk
you are all welcome here.   just dont ask what happened between the 2nd and 3rd ages
gandalf   tell me  friend  since when did frodo and the hobbits abandon reason for madness
predator 2. black main lead.
not just austin o brien. gx also had three of the seven star assassins - tania  don zaloog  and abidos the third. the first yu-gi-oh series as well  seeing as several characters were egyptian  marik  ishizu  rishid  shadI  etc.  and the cast had to go back to ancient egypt. vrains had go onizuka.
according to amazon we should care about the show because it has black people in it  not because it has a story worth watching.
sad I liked the 2 episodes of got more than lotr. what a weird time to be alive
that photo makes me feel so damn old.
Im surprised sean astin is into it. he s not exactly part of the hollywood world.
bizarre calling it lotr  its not the lotr  -elijah woods  sellout  amazonnazgul
I dont agree with what they are doing but I can forgive them since they dont usually virtue signal and are caught up in it and will quieten down again. more importantly they are not calling the fans racists etc.  all are welcome in tolkiens world just dont expect to be represented where you dont fit.
I have been unable to view amazon s  rings of power  middle-earth series. from what I hear  they have made a botch of it  for some reason dismissing the author  jrr tolkien. as an aspiring novelist of high fantasy and a keen admirer of professor tolkien  this very much gathers my attention.     what I infer to be a second issue derives from objections to what the entertainment industry for decades has called  racially blind casting . for a role where the ethnicity of the character is of no significance--a doctor  an attorney  a plumber--yes  any actor of reasonableability and experience deserves the job. we saw in the original star trek series gene roddenberry  the creator and producer  cast an asian  an african american  a german  an australian  etc. ironically  some of the actors endured censure expressly because of their genetic origins.     if the role is of a specific individual  or of a particular type-a middle-aged pastor of an ame church  an orthodox rabbI  a dakota sioux medicine man- well  it would serve the narrative to maintain continuity. I would be utterly unconvincing as andre the giant or princess diana.    I cannot sort out the convoluted intricacies and swirling nuances of what has occurred in recent months and years. however  I gather thatsome oppose the senior production team of the rings of power stories  in addition to their inexplicable disrespect to the author  as I had noted above  for casting actors in roles they see as physically  in terms of appearance  inconsistent.    this may not be expressly discriminatory ethnically. some people go further  seeing  racially blind casting  as somehow offensive  denying those with whom they identify as parts they by right ought to obtain  and this notion they see is another reason beyond merit predicated upon talent and training to disadvantage them--arguing this to be another form of prejudicial discrimination. this fails to take into account the principle of compensation  giving to a long-disadvantaged group at least some of what they ought to have had all along.
everyone disliked that.
it has nothing to do with racism but everything to do with respecting tolkien s works. the racism card has been played so much that it has no sting this dead horse has been beaten to dust. the fact that amazon is having to stoop to this level of skullduggery shows how disparate they are to protect their investment. the show is mediocre at best while the visuals are good the writing is poor  for most part the acting wooden  flow is almost nonexistent and the snore factor is a solid 9. I would rate it a 3 or 4 at best. the inexperience and lack of talent of the showrunners writers is on full display. as a side note I couldn t help but notice that the showrunners are very pale skinned  I guess inclusivity only goes so far.
he gotta a lovely bag from wokeazon lol
I dont think they need more people to watch the show  they had like 25 million viewers. some cast members were getting racist and hateful stuff thrown at them online in a similar situation like what cast members of star wars had happen to them. its one thing to be upset with race swaps for lore accuracy  but hardcore racists were just being racist because thats just what they do.
they payed them nothing. they just did it  cus they believe in the  cause . they re that delusional.
I dont even think the show is bad. I enjoyed it well enough. its certainly not the last jedi... however  I admit Im a pretty casual tolkien fan. thatsaid  I didn t have any issue with the show.
this disembodied ears thing is just plain creepy. it looks like conan went trophy hunting in middle earth.
Im gonna make a tv show correcting the problematic parts of the communist manifesto and modernizing it because this is now and the author wrote it in a problematic time.it will stay essentially the same  but we will speak of how good capitalism and private property is  and remove all of the blatant racism that marx wrote about.but yeah  essentially the same and will totally keep the lore intact.
I really like elijah wood and billy boyd  but I will have to disagree with their support for the rings of power... to be fair  its not only just the  race swapping  its also the story line  the characters and the acting Ive found thats also a problem in my opinion. when I read the books and watch peter jackson s lotr  I get this thrill of wanting to rewatch the films and read the books again. anyhow  overall amazon s the rings of power are disrespecting tolkien s work... its sad to see and hear.
remember people  its just fantasy...
I dont need the stars of the other movie I like to que me to like this one. if people aren t super excited to see this show  its for a very obvious reason. it just looks boring. they dumbed down every aspect of it  goofy looking elves with short hair  no recognizable characters from the lore  and the harfoots or whatever look like they ve been rolled in dirt for six hours. no one needed to be nudged to watch the Lord of the rings movies in theaters  because the story sold itself. this one  not so much.
but why though  how big of a side check did amazon have to drop  and what in the name of the Lord is up with that very unsettling stash frodo is rocking
I could not understand a lick of what you wrote.and Im verbose irl.
@jtopochi    I cannot speak to your capacity  or any lack thereof.    verbosity is not positively correlative to comprehension.    you might consider finding your most recent english teacher for clarification and erudition.
@david r. lentz  Im not exactly taking a shot at you. it is just to illicit that individuals with the ability to comprehend your post would be difficult to find as it is written in a highly cryptic and complex prose. that of a certain extent which I do admire and respect.it is however  beyond my capacity to truly comprehend or appreciate given my limited capacity or likely inadequacy in the above related subject matters that you ve associated with.I do hope that others may find better luck in a full understanding of your method of prose however as your delivery seem to be very sincere and heartfelt.I bid you a great day ahead  friend.
@jtopochi    thanks. you write  it is just to illicit   etc. I am unclear about your meaning here  had you intended  elicit   please
@david r. lentz  I stand corrected. elicit is the appropriate word.edit  I learn something new everyday  d
@jtopochi    I am a brilliant speller and an excellent writer. I am an aspiring novelist. yet each day I learn something significant.    I brought this to your attention because its meaning was confusing.
@david r. lentz  and I dont doubt that for a second after our exchange. if anything  it is very refreshing to find someone like you sharing your thoughts in such eloquence  albeit being a little too high a level for my meager level of ability in comprehension .I hope yourealize your dream one day and I shall be on the lookout for your novel should such an opportunity present itself.again  it has been an absolute pleasure my good sir and thank you for humoring me. my best to you.
@jtopochi    thank you for your gracious approbation. Imust insist that you are every bit as erudite and literary as my essays show me here.
thats because youre a casual. lmao. at least youre honest about not knowing any better.
agreed.
I like Lord of the rings  but I am not a fan. thatsaid  rings of power was okay so far  not terrible. I dont know the lore  so I dont know if its accurate  I would refer to the fans for any lore information. I totally understand the fans and respect their opinions on the show  the creators need to do better.
54 days til  halloween
he cant disagree with his fellow pretenders otherwise they will exile him.
that design tho  cant they at least make it looks good
wow.  elf ears.  I thought that would be a war crime.
just take a picture wearing a t-shirt  easy money  cant blame them.
I know this is irrelevant  but I like your new hair style.
inflation has hit the shire and the og hobbits are selling t shirts off the back of woke-ism
the  I want myself in x  is so dumb. hate those people. never had that feeling. insecure and sad I guess. while were at it  when will we have a movie about someone with severe eczema to represent me  lel
just 3 actors   getting paid to wear a shxt t-shirt.. they probably wont even watch this disloyalty!!! stay strong true fan s.
those guys look like something thatseattle house-husbands would post to apologize to their wives.
total pr move
I thought they were burnt fortune cookies on there shirts I was like wtf is this shit  lol
pointing fingers is the new political method for building power.
could be a pr stunt  lol
I was so disappointed when I saw elijah  dom and billy in those stupid multi-colored elf ear t-shirts. I thought they would be above virtue-signaling nonsense and turning on fans. I wont look at them the same again.
corporate desperation at its finest.
the cockrings of power
amazon giving us an in-depth tutorial on how to flush a billion dollars down the drain
what the hell is friday night tights
watch house of the dragon instead. its fantastic! I was surprised!
@w1llki11edsnake07  I will  thanks!
@ed man  no worries! seriously! its really good. hbo are redeeming themselves after what happened with season 8. house of the dragon is solid!
I never liked the kneeling scene in the end of return of the king. we see that is what you get for simping to a hobbit. they were useful but nothing more.
gandalf   fool of a took  no wonder he got mad over pippin in that well cave scene.
they must be getting paid a lot for this photo and its promotion in their accounts
one would think that a billion dollars could buy peace of mind. nope.
they dont look confident wearing the shirts  just sayn
elijah want some amazon money. this simping is out of the hand.
making a lot of bots happy with that tweet.
no elijah  why would you simp for rings of prat
facts
melonie they were probably paid money to do this.
meh. this is not about celebrites. its about the fans. we wont back down.
it really doesnt matter what they say. they were just portraying characters in a movie trilogy we enjoy. their personal opinions have no effect on true fans. I still refuse to watch rop  even if peter jackson were to promote it.
yes I dont need to be represented in something to like it.
damn you amazon
famous people cant say anything bad about woke culture  they can ruin their image or be canceled  thats why
none of them have done much since tlotr  they will have to do some big time sucking up
he s from la what did you expect
it has to be fake manufactured the episodes aired friday  yet they have all theis merchandise out to display on wednesday morning to make the post public something about that doesnt seem legit
revengetolkiencancelamazon!
nice try bezos  but this kind of vile gaslighting isnt going to make me want to watch the show.
orcs are welcome too
rop ghosted peter jackson.  that is insult enough.
the sea says this show is pure woke garbage and as they say  the sea is always right
dominic monahan and billy boyd
elijah who
all are welcome in fandoms  I dont care about the egos of spoilt brat actor s and actresses who have a mlk complex though.
I thought they were comas
no you still down want to tell you how to feel
this is sad
this series is a serial killer!  first tolkien  now the queen!  who s next
rings of diversity  I ll pass.
iam loving all the race and gender swaps
discord notif gang
I watch karate movies and enjoy them even though I dont  see myself  in them. and its not like if a white guy shows up Im like  oh finally! I feel represented!  this race baiting stuff is so ridiculous.
the wprst part of rings of power  is it is horribly  horribly written in general  and uses badly done woke ideas in specific.  galadiral is the biggest of mary sue characters  and done badly at that.
I think Imight love you yo xd
boycottamazon
normalizing the great replacement
these actors said  show me the money!!!!!! hey  where is the white ear on the tee shirt  hollyweird folk live in  hollyweird bubbles.
imo I quite sure if this is it from the pj lotr actors  this is just amazon have given their racist argument. and thats why they did this pr stunt. no way they were told that the backslash is about their terrible story  and change of canon.
beta
would everybody be cool if we made a white black panther
surely these hobbits got paid to simp for rop
I like that they are rolling out original trilogy actors after shitting on them a week ago. nostalgia bait all they like  bad show is a bad show.
if you were a star of the jackson movies you wouldnt get caught bashing rop. they are actors. part of the business. it wouldnt do any good for you. simple as that.
just another  cry wolf  from the showrunners
the first 2 episodes are good. I get the hate  but its political.
the rings of cringe. yikes. forged from the fires of mount doomed.
people are really telling on themselves by getting angry because black people exist in a fictional tv show.
manufractured racism the poor writing and terrible acting is the issue
actors   racism bad you  omg!! simping!!!! virtue signalling!!
the show is bad  how are these tricks going to make it become good suddenly
elijah has always been a beta. Im not surprised by this.
so cringe jeeeeesus
for fuck sake  why do they just not bring the africans and other ethnicities along with their respective folklore into the show    why do they have to tear up tolkien s original material
when I see your immaculate boom boom I get desperate too.when you speak on friday be prepared to speak from a chick perspective. use no logic just chick perspective.comment on wardrobe  furniture  whether you would want to date him.
no you were the chosen one elijah wood and for billy boyd you killed your career by playing glen and glenda in the shitty seed of chucky movie
talk about gay  the best part of fandom is gatekeeping and shit checking casuals outside of the actual content.
Imay be welcome there. the writing still is utter garbage.
such a cringy photo
professional pretenders are stepping out defending wokeness... pathetic
why is it okay to have a show  or movie with all poc  all hispanic  or all black  but all or mostly  or even partly white casts have to be  diversified
@lautaro b  please. by all means  define  wokeism
@chris frolik  dont play stupid
nobody realy cares about the colors....people are way more annoyed about...alot of things. like the hair  or lack thereof. dwarfs without beards  what the actual fuck      short haired elves
there s no sense of culture in amazon s middle earth. terrible world building  how are you supposed to differentiate easterlings from say rohirrim  everywhere is just multicultural now  absurd.
how much money is worth it to spit on your own legacy.
funny how on this shirt only white elves  guess white humans are not welcome
lazy folk! why dont they create different shows based on non-european folklore  do they hate non-european cultures
