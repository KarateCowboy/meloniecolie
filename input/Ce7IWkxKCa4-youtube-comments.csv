she said that isaac looks like he didn t want to work and found a new mommy. Im dead lol
japan gives us lady dimitrescu  while the us gives us stifler s mom in space.
I honestly think nicole being younger  as her original design implied  works so much better as it emphasizes the tragedy of her death.
completely agree. my first thought was   wait  is nicole still isaac s girlfriend or his mother now  . also  let s not overlook how diverse the security team is now. there s even a woman.  oh  and kendra mentioning her  girlfriend  now in the intro. got to tick those boxes .
seriously  the callisto protocol was able to make everyone look good.
when I first watch the first 18 minute demo of the game I was just shocked to see how nicole looked more like a middle aged mom than isaac s girlfriend. if I remembered correctly she was portrayed a more younger woman in the original game and the animated movie. also  this is the exact same thing they did to thess in the last of us next gen remake.
she went from  make us whole  to  I ll bake you some cookies sweetie
thank you for this video. I recently joined the biggest dead space group on facebook and all Ive seen today is crying about colisto and people getting mad that a lot of us dont like nicole s new design. someone even posted pictures of the actress saying we re so mean because she s obviously gorgeous and nicole is modeled after her.yeah! she is gorgeous! she doesnt even look 50 years old  yet in dead space remake she looks 55-60......yet she s 39 in the game. wtf
just look at the women in re2  remake. they look great and just like their models in the original game. give me that in dead space. there was a good reason why I went through ishimura in my teens. it was because there was a hot chick waiting for me somewhere in that horrible place. it is that wonderful clich  where you have to save the princess  but now only an old hag is waiting for you. if I were isaac I would just turn the ship around and fly away.
the first time I saw the new nicole  I though she was at least 50.the message they re sending is   you can either be beautiful or you can be a scientist or space engineer  but not both.
its honestly insane.. having beaten dead space over a dozen times on hardest difficulty back in the day I was shocked seeing this... nicole was cute  I was worried for her being scared  and alone in this nightmare... this nicole looks like an old crazy bat who wants to feed me to the necromorphs that I could give 2 shyts about. they clearly made her old  and ugly. why!  10 04 straight up altered the actress into a mans face.. thats not accurate to the real life her at all.also huge fan of the original kendra daniels  her voice  her performance.. listen to them in comparison.. the original is way more compelling  exciting  tough  and sexy in comparison.. the new one sounds dull  and annoying.same goes with hammond.. he was tough  manly  badass  terrified.... new guy sounds wimpy  and flamboyant.agenda of desmasculating males doesnt stop...  here s your dead space remake fixed with uglier woman  and wimpier men!
if they did this to nicole  I dont even want to see what they will do to ellie or lexine
Im sick of them intentionally removing feminine features from characters. its not even like they just slightly aged her or improved the graphics  they intentionally make all the features less feminine. I really dont get this trend and it cant die fast enough.
this is what you should expect from any studio that employs people who have graduated from a western school within the last 10 years. they have been taught that it is their primary duty to fix the world with  social justice .
just when I thought that finally a proper remake was coming...
Im calling it now. melonie being 36 is the biggest shock I ll have for this year. if I can look that good at her age  I ll know Ive  made it .
this goes well beyond games. watch almost any commercial that isn t for a beauty product or with a celebrity spokesperson  and youre going to find that they re either casting unattractive people or presenting attractive people in ways to tone down their perceived attractiveness.
some women do look like that at 39. there s women in their 50s who look dont look a day past 30 and vice versa. men too  this isn t just a woman thing. Im 39 myself  I see the whole range of that in old friends and former classmates. all thatsaid  it doesnt mean we have to uglify our characters. we want our stories and especially our interactive fantasies to have beautiful women and dashing leading men.
my mother is 65 and looks younger than those remastered women.
I never knew isaac and nicole were actually that old. I would have guessed both of them were ten years younger.
@spadesilver 90  nicole is already dead honestly who cares what she looks like  ellie is the real prize always was.
@chandler burse  until ds3 ruined her character completely
@nathan valenzuela  she was fine in ds3  what was wrong with her there  she isn t like some forced message strong woman who needs no man in it if thats what your saying because if you are then I dont think youremember the game well.
@chandler burse  no I loved how strong she was in ds2 in ds3 they made her some generic whiny character who constantly gave isaac shit even though the dude has been through hell from the undead and living then she played victim when even carver told her that norton tried killing isaac the one guy who cantranslate marker inscription for her sole purpose of destroying the signal
@nathan valenzuela  I guess she wa s a bit annoying but she wasn t the worst thing about that game.
@chandler burse  blah wouldn t go that far to say ellie is a  prize  bayonetta now   . gorgeous can kick ass and their is no agenda behind her games. last of us part 2 literally had the horrific anita sarkessian involved. naughty dog is disgusting lmao.
@chandler burse  and just pulled up that article yea their ideals at naughty dog is literally against everything melonie talks about lmao. their completely disgusting to female characters calling them  objects . apparently ellie is suppose to be  progressive  this is just get tiring. bayonetta 3 literally has viola which is more androgynous character but she is literally fantastic. no  oh we made viola more manly because of  sexism  it was just they made a character because they wanted to. naughty dog shouldn t be proud of being so sexist towards women
@dominatrix1999  that was a rumor it was never confirmed. for one neil said she wasn t apart of it and for someone so proud of her and his beliefs you would think he would tell the truth if she was or not. people just freaked out at the rumor.
so trueeeee
this is a woman her name is tanya clarke. they user her likeness and voice for dead space 2 nicole. dead space 2 nicole is closer I to isaac in age. so all they did was make her look how she does in dead space 2. she s only other returning va and face model in the remake.
@habijjj  nah.
@habijjj  she looks old enough to be isaacs mother now. it doesnt fit imo.
touch grass.
japan also gave us new tifa let s not paint them as saints haha
@invincible 117  what s wrong with tifa
@dominatrix1999  also we were talking about ellie.... from dead space 2. completely different character.
@dominatrix1999  ellie is a fine character. there isn t anything really wrong with her in part 1 or 2 besides the changes in her development due to joel s death.
@dominatrix1999  naughty dog is disgusting for the one woke game in their long line of successful power fantasies eh  love how easy fans turn against devs because they cant stand one title in a library. although nd is pretty stupid in my opinion for catering so much to last of us. even the first one isn t as grand as everyone wants to tell me. its story is its strongest point otherwise its nothing special. and the remake  the freaking remake that only came out 9 years after and is the first remake nd has ever made of one of their games and they pick their most sold  well ported and popular and newest ip game to do so  why not uncharted  or jak and daxter  nd picked tlou1 and I hate it.
isn t isaac clark in his late 40s
@nightmare corpse  yes although the remake kind of messed up there too I feel since he looks even more like elijah wood than before. they removed his gray hair I think this shows that the issue with nicole and isaac is just them poorly recreating their faces rather than being woke.
@chandler burse   I disagree 100  she literally left issac and came back to him cause her boyfriend died
@muhamad khan  thats not even how that went. she shuns isaac for most of the latter half of the game because of her bfs death and then the events at the very end bring them together because the world may literally end and isaac is about to die
@zmss  yaah https   static.wikia.nocookie.net deadspace images 9 91 nicole_profile_-_covergence.jpg revision latest scale-to-width-down 250 cb 20110806101044
@delta_reg  I dont see how. isaac looks pretty old himself its like you people forget he had greying hair and receding hairline in the original lol.
@chandler burse   link to empty image  yeah.........anyway it doesnt matter you are wrong and I am right you cant change that fact.
@invincible 117  yea what s wrong with new tifa
@zmss  the image thatshows she looks like this from ds2  really  yeah everything is woke and so against you. poor baby I know everything today hates you and me for being white males. even this game has a white straight male as a protagonist. good Lord. they are were trying to recreate her from ds2 people its not confirmed woke because she looks like that I think they just kind of messed up recreating it. you cannot tell me she doesnt resemble this in 2 does she not
@nathan valenzuela  her boobas are slightly smaller and nerds who use to get off to her pixels in ps1 days are mad about it lol.
ah yes lady dimitrescu everyone s favorite vampire mommy they draw rule 34 of lol. forgive the dev for not you know changing nicole so much thatshe has giant breasts and is 9 foot tall. which would be worse than what they did here to her. but I bet none of you would complain if they did.
@chandler burse  the new tifa is hot af she looks real now
@chandler burse  you do realize that people like looking at beautiful people for more than just fapping right no one likes seeing ugly or mediocre  characters as important characters in fiction. because we already see enough ugly or mediocre people in our daily lives
@habijjj  stop being delusional.
@bloody  based.
@invincible 117  its unfortunate thatsquare enix really wants to abandon everything just for the sake of people overseas that dont even play videogames. its frustrating to be honest. they forgot what made their games great and I hope they get bankrupt for this
@rogue dragoon  no. they censored her because she originally had a bigge chest. why cant we have big chested women in videogames now ! !
@rogue dragoon  coming from someone who s never seen a woman before
@dervy 101  she s still basically the same. and honestly I looked at her original model it was a bunch of odd rough pixels and they seem to be ridiculously huge there. you guys take one little design change and freak out. stop being so dramatic lol.
@dervy 101  I do acknowledge they exist and I have no problem with them whats with the strawman  my points are that there is also nothing wrong with smaller chested women. tifa is still pretty busty for goodness sakes.just as not as ridiculously cartoony looking as she was in the original which was a bunch of rough ended pixels.
@dervy 101  I also wonder what is the problem with small-chested women  I dont get why men still exist who only want super drop-dead gorgeous supermodels. I like women who look really like freckled redheads I dont care if their chest is big or not I am fine with either sure I get the love for boobs as a straight man  even if I have my own issues with my sex drive  but the fact is I dont really care when its the creator s choice and isn t really directly forcing a message in my face. personally  this is why I never got why people love jennifer aniston or pamela anderson so much they like one of those supermodel types of idealistic women but neither is that hot to me. courtney cox was better than both of them anyhow if we are going by the friends cast.
I would say thats offensive to stifler s mom  as even she always looks her best even at her age.
@chandler burse  I never said there was a problem with smaller chested. just asking why tifa was censored  obviously they re trying to cater to people who work at kotaku and ign
@chandler burse  but this is your preference. not mine
@dervy 101  exactly everyone has different preferences so why should every dang character adhere to everyone s preference here that is basically  its fantasy they all should be drop dead supermodel pretty  like cmon. and supermodel pretty is not that damn pretty anymore. it always looks fake. often it is. whats wrong with real women  who dont have silicon breasts  or constant amounts of makeup  thats all Imean.
@zmss  what diversity hires  what actors are bad  these are likely the same cast that played the originals.and what agenda
@zmss  I just think they screwed up a little. youre being a drama queen about this and this is why I cant take antI sjw viewpoints as seriously as I use to. you all seem as dramatic as actual sjws do nowadays.and you ve stated nothing that really helps your point anyways. like what diversity hires  isaac is played by gunther wright the same man who played him in 1  I believe he did the mo cap he just didn t voice him  but he did voice him in the later ones  and tanya clarke who played nicole in 2. where her role was the biggest after all.
@chandler burse  the only nerds getting mad about it are you people  lol.everyone else is just rightfully pointing out the censorship unnecessary changes. not our fault you get to worked up over it.
@chandler burse  -  exactly everyone has different preferences so why should every dang character adhere to everyone s preference... she should adhere to the original as closely as possible while still being updated to better graphics.why are you so intentionally dense about understanding this  why does acknowledging the reality of the situation upset you so much  what s with the denial  its freaking weird  man...
@schnek  Imean I do have an attraction towards arguing but at least I admit it. when you guys seem to be overdramatic over nicole and tifa s breasts to an extreme point. all I say is to take a step back and maybe breathe and realize that not everything has to be woke to you all  the same way sjws should take a step back and breathe and realize not everything is racist lol.
@schnek  Im not upset at it  thats not my point. I just dont get the comments here that are upset at not having them in the entirety of games. especially horror when games should have every right to feel more real and have relatable characters who aren t super hot people. I relate to isaac because he looks and feels like a normal working guy. I dont relate to brad pitt at all lol. horror works better that way when it feels like horrible things happening to normal people. super hot models in games like final fantasy and being constant is fine  albeit even I have my limits to some of the designs like cindy s in 15. her character is fine though but talk about unnecessary design choices that make little sense
@schnek  it is fiction indeed  which means the creators can make it however they want.  using it to its full potential is literally doing whatever you want with it even if it doesnt make sense sure. but the fact is creators of some things want to make sense and want to make real situations. and to be fair I dont making everyone hot is using it to its full potential anyways  especially since making grotesque ugly monstrous-looking beings would be more unique and actually doing fiction better. since making everyone hot is already common and boring in fiction just as average people are in real life.
@schnek  nicole isn t a perfect woman. she isn t redheaded lol. perfect doesnt even exist really  especially in human looks since its a subjective thing between every man and woman. also whats with the vvomen  I thought people argued that women actually wanted more beautiful characters in games  thatsounds like one of those terms internet incels Ive seen use. of course not saying you are one but the fact is why did you spell it like that lol. also how I am a simp in comparison to the commenters who are literally just praising melonie for her looks and points every which way lol. simp has no meaning anyways just a dumb internet joke or insult. same as shill or whatever else.
@schnek  she s adhering to the sequel which is when tanya clarke came in and was changed because the original devs wanted her to be closer to isaac s age. it is not always about censorship its not always about persecuting people. I think am the only one trying to understand the reality and not simply perceiving persecution at every nook and cranny of this dead space fanny lol.
she is hands down the lames character they came up with. looks like she is going to serve some tea and cookies  not murder anyone.
@chandler burse  sure let s make it more real by having isaac mom as his girlfriend. oooh so grounded   real  its amazing  modern audience will like it. bruh  at least touch up the wrinkle a bit lol
@dervy 101  current body goal is a femboy like body type that could throw around people like a ragdoll or an obese that could run 100mph. try to catch up lol
@chandler burse  of course they ll get mad  if somethings wrong and ain t right like it used to be  they will get mad. they have every right to get mad. what is this logic lol. modern devs trying to cater to modern audiences  mostly tweetard  cause that  otherwise we wouldn t even have this  debate .
@I sold your dog to a chinese restaurant  nicole never murders anyone she s already dead in the game.
@arif rahman  again my problem with everyone here is the constant perception that everything is an attack towards beautiful busty women or themselves rather than acknowledge the fact nicole s design does look sort of like this in ds2 and so does tanya clarke yes she doesnt look exactly right and that is an issue but nothing says its because they wanted to target modern audiences and to be fair do woke people really advocate for ugly women  or older women  Ive never seen a single actual sjw complain about younger women  just sexualized designs which nicole was never sexualized in the first place.
@arif rahman  I think we wouldn t have this debate if the audience here didn t take melonie s perceptions and their antI sjw mindsets to an extreme where they dont really try to research or think that maybe its not always about what you guys believe it is. its more or less a consideration thats what I think. people have clearly taken things too seriously considering people are assuming kendra is gay because of a hypothetical line she said in response to isaac.
@chandler burse  lol seriously . it is dead space 1 remake so the argument about dead space 2 is invalid. nobody asked for this remake in the first place. ea is the one to blame for the failure of ds franchise and the shut down of visceral games. now they want to sell a cheap remake for the price of a new aaa game. I am utterly sad that you people are defending all this insanity. pay attention to isaac s animation in the trailer - original game had better animations. if you live under a rock then I have to tell you that most games todays are inserted with some sort of sjw and this remake wont be an exception.f ea and their business model  f the corpos.
us gave us abbyzilla
@grumpy cat  abbymination.
@johnny  its a ds1 remake yes  but they changed her face in 2 to match her age  they also changed it because tanya clarke voices her. tanya clarke voices her still. and not to mention would it really make sense for the devs to make her look super young here then when they make a ds2 remake they age her up again  it makes more sense to keep it consistent now to the future. also isaac is now voiced  I guess they should also remove gunther wright then
@johnny  I think quite a few people wanted a ds remake. a lot of people talked about one before it was ever announced. isaac s animation looks fine I have no idea what you are talking about. yes ea is to blame  yes I get ea sucks. your one of millions who spout that every day and call people shills. good for you. the fact is  one can consider that maybe maybe for once in you people s little mindsets of being persecuted and your games being ruined by  politics  you cantake a step back and remember  nicole looked like this in 2  maybe thats all they were trying to do with her  but no its so woke  its defeminizing.  its nice to know you people think older women aren t feminine Im glad you believe your grandmothers are just older men in disguise lol  like make some sense. everyone here loves to continue on and on in their stubborn point just retelling the same crap Ive heard before. yet no one here is actually trying to think critically  while also pretending you do. listen just because you are an antI sjw doesnt make you somehow wiser than everyone else or make you less likely to spout nonsense that youre just regurgitating. my problem now is you guys sound the same as sjws  the only difference is everything you hate is now woke instead of racist.
@johnny  ea sucks yes  I know but we cant get viscereal back  and callisto which was made by the ds team seems to be a bit of a failure. this is all we got  and no one is stopping corpos making games anymore thats long past. and hell no  no one s ever gonna get enough people to boycott an entire company that just isn t possible. I just hope it can come out good  I get it ea sucks but they have made decent games before with decent devs. its not like mass effect or dead space  or dragon age after all. as long as microtransactions aren t in it. I think it could be pretty good and so far it looks fairly good and they ve added a lot to it. but this is the devs  not ea that has done this. I have no idea what you complaining about with the animations  isaac s walking was stiff as crap anyways  it could only be the same or better at this point.
@johnny  when I look forward to be a bit positive towards a game I dont look at the executive greedy capitalist idiots who make the big decisions. I look at the devs who can be salvagable. crash 4 and the n.sane trilogy where good games made by good devs  but they were still under activision who I wish would go out of business sometimes. just like viscereal were under ea but still made two good games   I argue ds3 isn t bad  its fun at least just not scary . all we can do is see. but thats not my problem here.
@grumpy cat  joel in one was a great cmon.
agree but isaac in headspace is like in his early to mid 40 s late reply so yea I know she looks older maybe like 50 s ish or alittle more idk what to say at this point rambling
bro just made my day ngl
@invincible 117  I wonder where squareenix s eithics department is based in  if there is one in the us  we still know who s still likely to blame.
kind of reminds me of that video of the dude in gamestop   it ma am!
yet they made jill look like a man and censored ada and ashley in the upcoming re4 remake
@rogue dragoon  why did that have to involve making her flat  yourealize females do have boobs in real life right
@luke t  it didnt make her flat what
@rogue dragoon  if a cup size is lowered 1 iota in this woke zeitgeist then it might as well be an a cup because it was purely done for political sjw reasons
young nicole would be way more horrifying than an old grandma nicole if I was hallucinating her because of the marker
such a good point
she s always been 39 when she died though right
@will thomas  yeah but she looked younger  which made her death seem more tragic. this is basic human nature  ignoring it for ideological points makes for bad writing.
well to be fair  it could also be realistic. as dead space is set 500 years into the future. her looking in her mid 20s at the age of 39  does seem highly plausible. especially when you see how young some actresses and actors look at similar ages with our technology - itshouldn t be surprising that better and more accessible tech centred around beauty and or preserving youthfulness  could makes someone nearing 40 look like in their mid 20s... in the dead space settings.
it also makes isaac look like a creep too though  a young looking nicole as a senior medical officer also doesnt make much sense.
@fluffy gargos  no it doesnt. yes it does.
@Im justin y.   I post pointless trash  on average it takes about 15 years of medical practice which is after a couple years of study so no it doesnt make sense for her to look 22
lol! so they did make her look like a lesbian.
the message
the original crew is all there  same as back in 2008
on the bright side they all become necrmorph food and each isic stands
I think the girlfriend thing is more of a reply to him. not implying she is lesbo  but agreeing with his behavior in the beginning.
@john doe  it is left for debate but considering the woke propaganda I d bet she is a lesbian.
ahh  thats not how I interrupted the girlfriend thing  she was responding to issac oppressively watching his video from nichole and poking hammond at the same time for being such a by the book dude.goes like this issac watching videokendra asks why he s watching itso muchissac says he misses nicholekendra says  heh  ya  I guess I d rather watch videos from my girlfriend then listen to hammond quote protocol constantly she s not saying she has a girlfriend  she s empathizing with issac and coitizing hammond at the same time.
@crazychase98  nah  the black woman survives  because...yeah  cant have that apparently.
@diacrusher  they all die in the original so
@sw0rdmstr  thank you for outing yourself as a weirdo  not only is itstrange to date someone much younger than yourself but it makes it even weirder to go for someone who seems like they just graduated high school  almost like they were waiting for the day that they became of age. the fact that you dont understand this proves that you yourself also find minors attractive  high school minors that is or at least women thatseem like they re still attending class
@fluffy gargos  the fact youre this passionate in opposing the idea of somebody looking younger is alarming...
@fluffy gargos  you just lost the argument by overexaggerating.
@sw0rdmstr  isaac is in his mid 40 s and also looks the part while nicole looked and sounded like a high schooler  how is this exaggerating
@fluffy gargos   how is this exaggerating   nicole looked and sounded like a high schooler   ----- right here for example. has hollywood really poison your mind into thinking high schoolers looks like the original nicole  smh...jeez  this is what happens when you casts mid 20 year old actors as  high schoolers
@robert mcdougall  oh  my bad didn t know you didn t attend school
@fluffy gargos  thank you for your projection.hope you graduate high-school. lmao
@robert mcdougall  you obviously dont understand how projection works
@fluffy gargos  youre a bag full of  ironies  that keeps on giving. lmao
@robert mcdougall  dude I dont know how old you are but high schoolers now definitely look like og nicole.behold the power of makeup and genetics.
you definitely not wrong . young people tend to have that blind optimisim and innocence and when we see something tragic happens to them  it packs way more hurt and emotional attacthment   now this is not to say older characters dont possess this  but its more believable as its most likely they haven t experienced the dark side of society yet.
@hey its quang  no they definitely do not lmao
@robert mcdougall  like a said how old are you and where are you from. the time and place matters a lot.
@hey its quang  Im beginning to question you and the other guy s perception of reality. this is what happens when movies and tv shows constantly cast 20 years olds as  high schoolers .
@robert mcdougall  bruh. people everywhere are different  genetics play a role  at my high school people looked older . culture also plays a huge role in the way people act.for example social media push s pics of the top 1  of attractive people  so teenagers especially girls try to replicate that with makeup and clothing. which has happened at my school.also og nicole has no strong facial features that would obviously indicate thatshe s a stereotypical adult. no angularity  no wrinkles  no nothing. she s soft all the around.
@hey its quang       for example social media push s pics of the top 1  of attractive people  so teenagers especially girls try to replicate that with makeup and clothing. which has happened at my school.also og nicole has no strong facial features that would obviously indicate thatshe s a stereotypical adult. no angularity  no wrinkles  no nothing. she s soft all the around.   thank you for proving my point. so you do agree with me that it is an over-exaggeration to claim that og nicole looks and sounds like a high schooler...like I said before and now further your media point. hollywood has habitat of pushing 1 er attractive people to fore front - but the worst part is... they also lie about it. for example  claiming certain muscular actors to be  natural   male actors using shoe lifts to boost their  height  but also having 20 year old actors to play 15-18 year olds high schoolers. I only just touch the tip of the iceberg in the amount of manipulations that goes on with hollywood and msm. bruh. people everywhere are different  genetics play a role  at my high school people looked older . culture also plays a huge role in the way people act. of course I know genetics plays apart... but dont act as if it a common thing for high school girls to look like og nicole. facepalmyou and the other guy are trying to stretch the bounds of what genetics   culture  and make up could do  in trying to make itsound like that high school girls in general look like 20 to mid 20 year old women aka og nicole. cut the bs.
@robert mcdougall  no I dont agree with you. did you not pay attention to what I said about her face  also yes media does play a role and its too late now. thats what they look like now.if we re talking about 13-15 then no they dont look like her. but 16-17 they can. I guess I should have clarified that. Im not using media to judge Im using what Ive seen irl.
@hey its quang  yes I payed attention to what you said  also og nicole has no strong facial features that would obviously indicate thatshe s a stereotypical adult. no angularity  no wrinkles  no nothing. she s soft all the around. I even highlighted that part for you... again nothing you have said suggest she would be anymore a high schooler at age 16-17 then her being 20-25. nor does itsuggests that is common look for them as well. heck there are women roaming about with soft facial features and no wrinkles into their early 30s... smh...
@robert mcdougall  she s supposed to be around issac s age man. granted the og was on the 360 which had bum graphics by today s standards. but if we re going of thatshe does look younger.when was the last time you ve seen multiple teenagers  nothing you ve said suggests the opposite either.
@hey its quang     she s supposed to be around issac s age man. granted the og was on the 360 which had bum graphics by today s standards. but if we re going of thatshe does look younger. yes  I agree with that - however Im willing to accept the idea of the 500 years old futuristic setting would be reason thatshe still remains looking like in her 20s  despite being around 30-40 year old. when was the last time you ve seen multiple teenagers  nothing you ve said suggests the opposite either. yes I have and I find it hard to believe that they would in general look like her  around the ages of 16-17 as you said before. 18-19 sure... but 16-17 no  not really. hence why questioning you guys idea of  teenagers  and  high schooler . and you are correct - I haven t because the convo never progress to that level with the other guy. for me her body size is the major factor here  which generally does not look like a 16-17 year old teenager. she looks as if she s in her 20s  early or mid . most 16-17 year olds have not filled out like that  and generally are still growing.seriously... she s looks like your average 20 year old  early or mid ...
@robert mcdougall  eh it is what it is  we simply have different views because what we ve personally seen.
she is 39 . okay okay  I get it. but  ask any woman if they want to look the age they have. none.in my mind  the way I see things now is that nicole be beauty and kendra have big fun-bags in the original are in pair with the horror tropes of the  beauty and the best   sexy women   ugliest monsters attackers. and the mc in the middle trying his best to save everyone  kill the best and get the girl s  in the end. unfortunately  in  current year  political climate  it got impossible to western game devs  usa europe  to challenge themselves since they embraced mediocrity. nicole now is uglier that a man in they middle ages  while kendra lost her bobbas and got a  girlfriend   very important to the plot .modders go save us. I guess. visceral is dead. the memories are alive. ea still sucks.
@hey its quang  agreed  each to their own.
@fluffy gargos  there s not really anything wrong with nicole s old design. although she does look dated compared to the later games. but there s also nothing wrong with her design in ds2 which is clearly the design they were trying to replicate here. not her ds1 since I think the actress was changed in ds2.
@internet mouse  nicole experiences the dark side of her society full forced lol. evil of consumerism  meddling with ancient alien artifacts and cult like obsessive religion. and of course body horror monsters. all at once.
@igo dreamer  kendra s boobs look the same they were never that big. I feel you people really are trying so hard to reach to find an agenda here. you need to take a step back. calm down and maybe remember that nicole s design was changed before to already look older. and kendra is not as ugly as people say I have no idea why are people saying she looks weird she looks about the same in the original there are always differences but she isn t ugly. and the fact is dead space isn t about ogling women. nicole is dead anyways  its about playing as a sole survivor basically a relatable blue collar worker. who isn t meant to expect such horrors that await him. there s also a few things about consumption considering the planet cracking and exploitation being a small cause of the necromorph pandemic as well as unitology being cultists and seeking to meddle with it for the sake of their own false faith.
@igo dreamer  kendra never says she got a girlfriend people are using the line  I d listen to my girlfriend over hammond  which was a response to isaac focusing on nicole in their conversation. that does not 100  confirm she has a girlfriend at all. itsounds more like she is making a hypothetical joke poking at hammond.
nicole is dead.isaac    eh  it was her time...   turning the ship around and go home
@wildan saladin  this joke is sort of funny but I cant help but acknowledge isaac couldn t do this even if he wanted when he finds out she s dead lol.
@chandler burse   spoilers ............... ... he knows.
@grimwolf lvl99999  would be a waste of money I think to buy an a list actress for a character whose dead anyways lol.
@sw0rdmstr  Im sure you do now lol. sorry for the constant arguing I guess since it is your comment. but I am too much of a ds2 fanboy not to at least say so.
also her being younger makes more sense than looking like a grandma since men usually tend to date younger women than themselves
@garrus vakarian  nicole is younger than isaac as far I am aware.
@robert mcdougall  this is true dont they have stasis freeze chamber that prevent people from getting old  wasn t issac in one of them
@itsdistinctly  the first person that technically dies in the game is two guys lol.
nicole has always been older in the lore though. I think she is actually supposed to be around 40  and this character design matches that more accurately.
I keep seeing a bunch of people that knows nothing about characters and lore here  y all should do some research before spitting misinformation you believe its true. nicole is not supposed to look young and there s a bunch of reasons including her degree  for how long she worked at the field  for how long she s been with isaac  and his age. her looks in the first game was a mistake they fixed on the 2nd.
@thatbigbear  people dont consider anything.
wtf
@rafterman  40 and 22 is not a big difference  in appearance the remake nicole looks pushing 60
you dont have to justify why she was cute. she was and that is all that matters.
@einherjer  uh no  not that I know of and it makes zero sense if they did because isaac is still fairly aged along with literally every other character in the series besides ellie.I dont know what you are referring to but as a fan of ds I dont think there is ever a ageless cryo chamber in the games.
@crazychase98  well this is a remake  not even remaster. they re going to change a lot of things  in the worst ways possible.
to be fair kendra being a lesbian does not surprising.
kendra behavior  personality and every single words that came out of her mouth is supposed to be completely fake and  only served to misleading isaac into thinking she is an trustworthy ally and hammon is the evil milittary guy.but honestly I highly doubt that the development team is that fucking smart.
I still have my original copy.  same with tlou.
isaac clarke is supposed to be 47 years old. the people complaining about this aren t real fans of the original.
@eric staples  yo he was a good looking 47 y o tho. his wife was bomber too. I dont want realism in my escapist entertainment personally  especially with how bad its gotten in the past couple years. make folks enjoyable to look at ffs
@zmss  you ain t wrong. and this is not that   cool lesbian character that actually has depth to her character and is a likable character  oh no no. they most likely gonna make her unlikable and very annoying.
@internet mouse  yes unfortunately they dont know how to write and every character has no depth  if this game wasn t made by people better than them then they would ve never been able to achieve anything close to this  imagine spending days in the planning room discussing how they can insert  diversity and inclusivity  instead of trying to innovate and add to the game.
yep  I heard that bs too.  girlfriend   why  because everything its a platform for political discurse  and you are forbidden to escape. the game look good besides some unnecessary changes here and there  lots of particle effects because its a next-gen thing. but  the characters looks awful. funny enough  the necromorphs looks like the only ones to get a better treatment overall. what joke  man. really.
might as well make a bingo book with today s woke or diverse stuff being shoved in today s entertainment.
@diacrusher  she still on the ship they came in on. she didn t go in to the ishimura and was ordered to stay behind for medic or repairs. last I checked thatship blew up in the original at the end of chapter 1.
@internet mouse  doesnt kendra betray isaac in the game  she was the bad guy why should she be likable
@bcd32 dok  well  regardless  I only care about seeing the death scenes in remake at this point.
@tom  what u mean  in the original kendra said thatshe like isaac  so no  she isn t a lesbian.
Imean  dead spaces itself also had its own boxes. it was pretty much following a scI fI horror movie step by step. so  yeah. but there s a black person in the team  as well as a woman  just like before. that must definitely be ticking boxes. and youre overthinking a slight phrase kendra  a secondary and pretty much stereotypical character  made.and honestly  this very cutesy lady doesnt seem to have seen people from any other place than the 4 meter surrounding her. Ive met people beyond tired and consumed in jobs  that barely in their 40  look fucking old. Ive met female colleagues who didn t have the choice to be a pretty bimbo  and had to do tough works  and they were even bigger than kendra.look  in truth  what annoys you is this horror story you ve made in your own mind  and the way you will always find a way to fit things into it. not all women are slim  having character variety isn t some sort of agenda  if it is so terrible why are the standards the same than 100 years ago honestly  people that react like this to such small things  could be perfectly comparable to flat earthers. if your horror story was real  I wouldn t have to think twice about wearing a crop top  because what if people feel spooked of my abs  I wouldn t have had to speak with all these hhrr people  because there wouldn t have been this dude actively disrespecting me  for no actual reason at all.by your shitty standards  honestly  my 33 years old sister would look like an old hag. and  guess what  thats what she believes  most of the time. honestly  if there s an agenda against thatsort of mindset  Im glad it isn t just a horror story.grow a pair. if youre so worried about it  why dont you go do something about it  Imean  you could spend your life in something very different  like learning how to help people  but nah. bitch about the magic agenda of doom.
y all are so sensitive God damn just ignore those parts
@gavin aeilts  plot armor for  muh diversity  characters   they already stated they ll change story in remake
@thisisrubbishlo  nope
wouldn t be the first time ea tried to ham fist politics on us. anyone remember the whole battlefield 5 kerfuffle with that prosthetic handed woman bit  the only reason anyone will buy this remake will mearly be nostalgia bait.
@zmss  wouldn t be surprised but politics is a sure fire way of being creatively bankrupt which will eventually lead to financial issues. just ask marvel comics.
@ryan vetter  his physics teacher.
@zmss woke propaganda  good to see people talking about their relationships with no issue then
@zmss its also just her pretending to sympathize you dolt
@drep lap  I didn t call you names so thanks ! if thats how  enlightened  people act so I guess I ll stay ignorant.
@zmss  when you call sympathizing  woke propaganda  simply because you dont understand what she was saying then yeah I cantell  also seems like you cant understand the game was still being worked on given your other comments
@zmss  learn about sympathy then
@drep lap  you learn about anything first.
gamers when gay people
@bcd32 dok  thats what happens  they actually showed it occur in I believe the extended gameplay  or maybe a different video.  but yeah  you see the other pilot get shredded by a necromorph during the moments leading up to the shuttle exploding  its easy to miss though  its in the corner of the screen.
@just another guy no one would say a thing if it also was in the original. you are ignoring that just to mock people.
@diacrusher  you can literally look up their ship they flew in on blowing up for the remake and see thatshe dies in the explosion  but I guess its more entertaining to make up some  woke narrative  for you to argue against
@tinoxc  yeah  Im mostly fucking around. I just find it kinda funny thatsome people are getting so hard pressed because of some details about a character detail as minuscule as who they re dating. on top of that  its mentioned in passing  its not that big a deal. they all die in the end except for isaac anyway  so is it really that big a problem  besides  a lot of the characters weren t really fleshed out in the original  so those are completely clean slates. Im also not a fan for some of these changes  but they re not that huge of a deal. dead space is getting a remake  and Im all here for it.
@killmanjoro  subject to change  probably  my point still stands  remake ll be woke piece of shit with a lot of things changed  I ll  probably still watch death scene compilation but wont even bother pirating it.
@diacrusher  you just gotta pick and choose your fights here  including the youtuber in this video. the movie industry is full of pandering to  woke  ideology  and I can agree with examples  but video games dont really seem to be pushing it like is being agi-propped in this video. I think most fail to realize that all characters in this series specifically are modeled after their voice actors. these are just real people she s spewing are  ugly   when in reality they re just normal ass people. claiming  woke  here is a massive stretch even if the game hasn t come out yet
@killmanjoro  video game industry  at least western part of it is indeed pushing it  with things like the last of us sequel and whatnot  then again   I am drunk right and cant be arsed to argue any further  not like an internet argument will change the opinions of eitther of us.
you can just tell blackrock and or vanguard has invested into this.
since she is 39 year and approaching 40 she will start to age   and she does not take plastic surgery like most women
@jermaine wright  women with plastic surgery often look worse than they would if they didnt I feel.
what why  isaac is 47 in the original version  in ds1 her model was based on her 31 year old voice actress  in ds2 it was based on her new voice actress. the remake s va for nicole is from ds2 who is 50 years old at this point  gunnar is 49 years old atm. it makes sense why she s way older  her voice actress has aged too. not to mention she has a senior title in medical field which makes even more sense thatshe s older
