new favorite youtuber
nothing says supporting females like covering them up  erasing them  or altering them! thanks  comic books!
Im so glad that the quartering recommend you to me and his subscribers I love these videos that you do as your honest and sincere in what you say
the quartering sent me here and I am happy to see you are not denouncing him with all the pressure to do so by the woke.  he has sent us to a gem of a woman.
and marvel wonders why people are leaving for manga.
I dont believe in censoring or altering an artists works without their permission even if its something Im against especially when there wasn t an issue to begin with. been loving the content. keep up the awesomeness.
I cant help but laugh every time I see melonie s channel picture  its just so silly
ah yes  racial sensibility in a tame art piece or how I like to call it  how to make an artist stop drawing ethnic characters into their stories 101  ever wonder why diverse characters never get a fandom or fanart  its this logic thatscares artists and comunities away from drawing ethnic ppl
I started following you in twitter vecause of the tomb raider opinion and you have quite honestly became my favorite gaming personality. its great to see you expanding to pop culture stuff. its refreshing to see people not bow down to the woke. they are like the bullies you see in those high school movies.
the first thought I had when you showed the first alteration was that they put googlie eyes on the picture.  I burst out laughing when you said the same.  glad to know I am not alone in thinking that.  great video.
jeremy seems like a great guy. he sent me here and I like your attitude and being real. you are going to go far.
man  I love drawing. I grew up with 90s era art  and drew every single day. I loved the process. marvel used to be the benchmark of the industry. anatomy  perspective  full backgrounds  motion  action  you name it. the  how to draw comics the marvel way  was my Bible as an artist. mark bagley  todd mcfarlane  greg capullo on spawn  were my top inspirations at the time. I am so disheartened to see how awful the art has become at marvel. the good artists are treated like trash  and underpaid  or replaced by a mediocre  diversity  hire who s barely out of diapers  and cant draw to save their lives. Ive seen awful panels in the big two s comics  clearly drawn by people who just dont have what it takes. they produce flat  lifeless  boring  almost no action  rarely any splash or double splash pages  no idea of how eyes work  how fabric flows  how limbs bend  etc.and this now.. wtf is this
directed from jeremy s channel and really enjoying the content - love the frank discussions and Bible verses. you got my sub! and yeah  you are definitely among people who accept and like you for who you are and not because of subscribing to woke garbage.
actually the  improvement  shows everything you needs to know. they are trying to do  the right thing   but all their efforts have that fake uncanny valley vibe.
great on the artist for getting on this.  how is that even legal for someone else to  touch  up his art  isn t that illegal  a great video mel.
its crazy how you seem like a breath of fresh air when you are just soooo   normal   down to earth  relatable. you are honest and genuinely open minded with a good heart. youre not the type to end friendships and cut ties with family because because of  how they vote or if they re va xe d. glad youre feeling more comfortable in your own skin and our finding out that people  value your thoughts on these issues.
daily drama news and daily devotion in one video  this is the best!
the sad part is marvel would not have even thought twice about this unless they were called out.  good stuff mel keep up the good work.
I agree  its his work so he can do what he wants with it and if he wants to put it up for everyone to see the difference between his work and marvel s then fine. love his style.
giving credit where credit is due  jeremy has excellent regard for his community and frankly I appreciate him for sharing this gem of a channel!excellent content! keep up the amazing work! it is refreshing to see more people with the ability to critically think! not everything needs changing and not everything is muh reeee-ismus also adore how you include an apt verse in your videos. again keep up the excellent work and Imust say compared to melomaniacs  macrebels sounds soo much cooler! I am excited to see how this channel will play out! may gott hold you strong in his hand.
forreal lol
ha! I know right. its like they think its helping women to make them look like men or something
look up the blow back thatstarwarsgirl got for  fixing    hate that term  she hulk. her version of the art was far more appealing than the abomination the original was.
that why I rather support anime and manga  japan doesnt care about woke stuff.
totally agreed. there is nothing inherent sexist or objectifying  in depicting female or male characters in a natural way. especially when its art.
I found this channel thanks to the quartering
I dont even follow the quartering   not sure why yt decided to recommend her.  never heard of her. Im guessing they haven t yet figured out she s a wrongthinker.
aye. me too was aware of the persecution she was been forced upon. so I came and subscribed out of need to support her. eventually stayed due her funny lines and relevant content.
@transroofkorean  funny thing that might be mind blowing to you  I dont know. I think youtube treats people differently based on your country possibly   like I see this kind of comment alot and I assume that its mostly americans complaining about this kind of thing. I live in south africa and have never seen any leftist crap on youtube pretty much ever. this kind of channel I would get recommended no problem. maybe its just based on the fact that I have never watched anything even related to leftist crap since youtube came out
@transroofkorean      she s a wrongthinker
yes! manga is sooooo much better!
they know...they just dont care. these activists in charge think pushing their agenda is more important than profit  or putting out a product people actually want.
@melonie mac go boom  14 17 oofff.... thats a lot of wishful thinking. the only way thats gonna happen is if the entire industry is gutted head to toe from all these woke people... but I think its more likely they go down are disbanded before you see such a tremendous reorganization. I think they just eventually figure its just not worth it and dissolve the entire thing rather then trying to do the monstrously large task of having to restructure it.
@armando aranda     subtle.
manga s more creative and less corporative nature has even led western artists to pursue thatstyle  like with  city hall   drawn by french artists. although many are under the umbrella of the magazines  I think any mangaka can just draw something they like and it can rise in popularity and not be considered  niche indie  because its not within the titans of marvel and dc. I think its pretty great that people see past the black and white and want to draw something cool with all the perks manga style gives them.on the other hand  it does leave manga anime open to be western-fied and woke. just look at rwby or legend of korra.
well  thats what happens if you get cultists zealots in.... but I think its incredibly condescending to the creator as by definition art wether its a statue  a painting or a drawing  its the artist  impression. now its a different thing if you are restoring work and you fuck up  like that Jesus painting  became a debacle and they ironically have not corrected it coz they noticed the debacle was drawing in tourists that were curious about the entire debacle .
marvel has lost their marbles.
bahaha yess xd
@armando aranda  dude this is such a weird comment.. especially to post repeatedly...
@andrew keen  he just wants attention I think.
you know if we all explore other cultures we might become more understanding. thats the last think the woke want.
facts
yeah  I personally dont really get into that entire debate of reee I like the classics  I like the reboot thing.... I see it more as james bond  where every actor that played him brought his own stuff into it  yet it was still recognizable enough as being james bond.... the only thing I thought was bad was the latest tomb raider movie... it felt as if lara croft could explode into a  id diversity  temper tantrum at any point in time.... she s portrayed as this spoiled almost woke and extremely weak character.... certainly if you pit that up against how angelina jolie acted the role  oh btw  fun fact  the father of lara croft in that movie is also angelina jolie s real father .
first of all  love the name. you a deftones fan also I recall following alex ross on ig and him telling his republican fans to piss off because potato biden was the best choice I have never felt so saddened. no more agreeing to disagree in this world  only blind followers allowed.  so many in the industry  across mediums  have been letdowns or just outright losers.
@aurumfae  yes  I am a big deftones fan. and yeah  it is really a tragedy what has been going on in the comics industry. outright purging  removal of the old guard  etc. just gross. itshouldn t matter who you support as president. just draw something that looks badass. write a story with character and heart and action. at least try to make itseem like you care. thats all people are asking for. I d kill for a steady professional art career  but these clowns keep getting placed on comics they clearly dont care about  and keep failing upward solely for pr reasons  even though the industry is on life support.
I think at this level  its marvel s art  no  I thought thats how this usually works.
@matsudaira  Im no lawyer or anything  guess that comes down to rights and such.  guess that would change the narrative if the art becomes property of marvel at that point.  yeah itsucks for the artist but not much they can do.  does go back to the video though  the big corporate machine just does whatever they want and it easily could should ve gone to the artist to resolve.
I love that you talk about your faith and read Bible verses in addition to covering pop culture stories!there s a lot of catholics that discuss their faith and current events and they very rarely cover more geeky subjects   but I haven t seen a lot of Christians do that.
what I appreciate the most is thatshe s so indifferent despite wokity woke wokeness. keep up the good fight mel.
keep setting everything up. wish there were more truthful  honest  and decent people who aren t afraid to be themself on the platform. we need more of it.
I wanted to get into comics  as a chick that wanted to draw and write my own stuff. marvel and dc have become a  show. its ridiculous to editsomeone s art like this.
this woke nation and cancel culture reminds me of the salem witch trials. just pointing fingers at people without giving them a voice. he without sin cast the first stone....a lesson that Jesus taught us and this new nation needs to learn. keep doing what your doing melonie!!!
excellent vod  mel! nobody and Imean nobody should be  fixing  somebody s art. the art that people make are very important to them and to have them  fixed  is just saddening for those people and angering them as well. its not ok.
I really like the vibe of these videos more than some other channels.. a lot of people tend to come off pretty toxic and angry with these types of videos but you come off the exact opposite. makes these videos kinda fun to watch and without any toxic energy.
I cant help but laugh whenever I hear of a person company overcompensating to  show they aren t racist  because they always end up showing they actually are racist.
as an asian american  marvel s changes rub me the wrong way.
if he didn t air this in public  you know it was have been swept under the rug. if anyone complained about the asian stereo typing  they would have pointed the finger at him. good for him  for standing up for his work... Im with you on that color pop in the 2 pages he shows. that is greatness.
first one your googly eyes description is spot on  second one of the little girl makes her look like she has seen some s.h.i.t.or is in the process of witnessing said s.h.i.t.
at first I wanted to work for the comicbook industry  but now seeing these thing happening in comics its very disheartening that the standards are really different.
I have honestly become quite inspired by you since Imade my way over to your channel like many. ie referral from @thequartering. inspired by your presence and almost abrasive delivery. yet you also seem to have crazy similar mindset goalset on ...well almost every topic I have Ive heard you discuss. like so similar that  I found myself finishing some of your thoughts simultaneously in my head. initially I was rather freaked out cause I dont think I have ever done that.     itstarted to reoccur as I progressed through you few videos. so for one. I d like to take this moment to tell you how awesome you and your message is ..two I believe wholeheartedly in  your key foundations considering most of the topics you have discussed in well the past hmm 2 days I think. haha  as well as should be spoken about more than it does .    anyway   I do apologize for how intense this message may be for you. it is I guess simply how unexpectedly intrigued I have become.  enough that I wrote this entire comment which I still dont even know the extant of my point. but was so enthralled that I almost felt I needed to connect you and relay my gratitude amongst other things.   also idk what bit of southern touch to your voice you have. but it rocks kinda like you it fits you ... I am from nyc born and bred so I am unaware of where. allz I know is the more I learn. I am in awe of you. so mel thanks for being you and keep the vids coming. you have probably reestablished a glimmer of hope for us as humans and women. I thought girls like you may have disappeared for good or just heavily endangered. but you have single-handedly proved there is still hope for us as a species. lol        I hope this finds you well mel it was meant to be a simple compliment. I am much better at this kinda thing in person. whew lol keep it upyour bound for great thingsbest  scotty
always love these videos  melonie mac. glad to support you. also marvel comics have become dumpster fire and I haven t watched their movies since the new movie spider-man no way home.b
I love that you aren t ashamed or shy about your beliefs. so rare in our generation. keep fighting the good fight miss!!!
way back in the late 80 s I was working at the chemical bank which at that time had its main uk office in the strand. on the third or fourth floor was where all the dealers worked and in the lift lobby there was a stylised painting of a sheep  which despite being one of the ugliest paintings Ive ever seen  was quite an expensive piece of  art . the bank was interviewing young graduates for jobs on the dealing floor  and many of them were without a doubt some of the dumbest smart people you could wish to meet  anyway one of these geniuses decided to draw a hitler moustache on the sheep  suffice to say he didn t get the job but he did get a whopping repair bill.I cant help feeling that guy would have felt right at home in the marvel bullpen...  also  isn t the bullpen the place on a farm where most of the bullshit come from!
I am not an artist but I can only imagine how annoying it is to mess with your art for no reason.... also  nudity when used correctly gives so much content and feeling to an artwork  taking it away is honestly dumbing down the frame. this is not even for kids  why !also asians tend to have smaller eyes  why try to erase this  this is racism imo  they are beautiful the way they are and the artist did them justice  3
used to follow melanie mac for gaming until adulting got in the way  now shes adulting and earned a new sub  thanks to the quartering for brining to my attention. so glad you haven t lost your mind like the rest of the world seems to have  and you stood against the mob... much respect
keep drawing dont get obsessed with yourself on youtube . remember who you are and enjoy the success  3
my one suggestion  and you probably already know far more about this than I do  is dont attempt to monetize through the youtube partner program.hopefully you can get enough support through sponsors and subscribe star patreon whatever.yt partner program just gives them more control over your content. they re bad enough as it is  but the partner program puts you front and center for scrutiny and they re more likely to flag and remove content they dont like.just my thoughts from observing a boatload of other content creators over the years and what has happened to them.much love  homegirl.
honestly  you d probably do much better if you self publish. dc and marvel are hell bent on pandering your story would probably turn to shit after heavy editing and censorship.
@erika hart  I definitely agree with you. I have no desire to go into the  professional  comic industry. they would destroy my stories characters.
well  your not the only one... just look at their sales. if marvel didn t need the copyright of the characters for their incredibly successful  universe   they would have disbanded the comic industry long ago. the fact that they are so successful with their universe rubs me the wrong way... like it makes me wonder how many iq points society dropped to go totally full enthusiasm into essentially what is made for 13 year olds.... like actors these days either play in extremely bad remakes or run around in capes  saving yet another day in gotham city
anybody else an old school melomaniac  I was one of the first people to order her first bit of merch waaay back in the day  maybe 2014   - a pretty great black shirt with  I think  a green silhouette outline...I think there is a picture floating around out there of me wearing the shirt  standing in front of my tv watching one of melonie s videos.  the world has definitely changed since then.. but oh well  time to give the new channel a shot.. let s freakin  go!
is there an  alan smithee  type thing artists can do to take their name of of work where they didn t get final cut and aren t happy with what s published
your welcome! keep up the good work!
so wouldn t marvel be familiar with his art style prior to hiring him
its annoying because now companies are like preemptively changing or editing things just in case it could be taken one way or another. no one is allowed to interpret things anymore or be expressive.
always look forward to listening to the Bible verses you have in each video its definitely something unique and not a lot of people do it. keep it up!!!
wus uuuuuuuup girl !!!! your my  2 channel right behind thequartering  the normal people community still exists and will gladly watch your videos! you have good content and are very down to earth normal from what I see.
I d look into all the socials that jeremy uses as well just in case youtube decides to do to you what they did to him. that being said  good video and God bless!
love the new channel so far. keep up the great work!
ah yes melonie tuning into the rebellious queen she is. im here for it.
honestly the best part about your videos is the Bible verses. please dont stop doing that. hardly anyone has the courage to do that.
love your art! wish I could draw.
thats all  I was expecting worse  marvel and dc have a long history of altering artists work but usually they are content with covering up butts and boobs because  muh feminism   that eye thing is certainly new but not really a surprise given the racist roots of wokeness.
wow Im new to channel but I really really like your format   to the point  down to earth and just real. I enjoyed it
great tactics at marvel s site  first they antagonised their fans and lost them for  twtr crowd   now they make their artists mad  it is just 1st one that went vocal .they dont have any clue how to make money  so their funding my dry soon  but they have  the message!  to send  so maybe they just dont care at this point...
came for the quartering - stayed for the content . I hope you do well - no pressure
Im a firm believer that googly eyes improve everything.......except art
loving this channel  love the daily Bible verse thing  that is awesome. you are awesome.
Ive never seen characters that looked so surprised
awesome content so far. you got yourself a sub. keep it up
that  improvement  actually looks horrifying
man  I wish I could draw well enough to illustrate a comic book. I d have been super pissed if I were him too...
I like your pov.  I d watch more videos of you daily if you make them.
love that you ve been sharing verses in this channel!
I like to follow subscribe to a bunch of people thatseem to have different ideas and perspectives  both from me and each other  and also seem honest and genuine. jeremy  thequartering  is one of them  and he sent me here. lucky for me  I now have another interesting  genuine person in my  collection . Im looking forward to more videos!a suitable Bible verse for this might have been matthew 7 1-5  about the splinter and the beam  its quoted often enough to be clich   but for good reason. in this case  of course  it would even have literal relevance  with all the eyes involved  up to and including the obviously blind folks at the marvel bullpen.
great content  great verse. thanks for courage.
so  well-spoken  a Christian and she draws so glad I supped to your channel!
seriously been loving your videos keep em coming ok mac!
there was nothing wrong with his art.that tweet saying wounded korean soldiers were forced to have double eyelid surgery is baseless.  the article screenshotted in the tweet can be found online at the korea herald and itsays no such thing. itsays other very creepy things  but it doesnt say that.
keep up the amazing work.
manga and anime is the way forward for storytelling  nothing in the west comes close to shows like attack on titan or my hero academia
thanks to the quartering for getting me here - diggin your content! thanks for doin what you do!
family friendly social commentary......that is good. thank you!
found my way here from thequartering and this is my first video watched. comics have been in the toilet for years now and Im partially glad I stopped buying them. the money went to a car payment instead lol. sidenote  while Im not Christian  I appreciate the little Bible verse at the end. I thought it was neat. just keep being yourself
I love these types of videos from you!
2 27  melonie -  on my bucket list to draw my own comic!!      me -  on my bucket list to write my own comic!!!super awesome!my creative juices already flowing and I want to get into  my imagination station  to do work. how fun would it be to collab!
didnt you start a comic long  long ago  im pretty sure thats how I found you back in the day  on an app you could find shitloads of comics on. I dont remember what that app was called  but it was bad ass
very nice art work. do not change it. they that do not like your art.. let suck raw eggs. nothing says jealousy like tearing down someone else s art work!
hiya  just come over after watching the quartering.you have my support because he is a good guy.and from what I have heard you deserve so much better.so stay strong. new subscriber from uk.
youre now my favorite person on the internet! keep speaking out!! we need to get you on sydney watson and elijah schaffers channel  you are here .  macrebel 100000
preach!
only problem is   american authors thatsee and realize that  then try to copy the anime   manga style and shit out absolute abominations  muddling what counts as anime or manga...
@fumomo fumosarum  very true but they fail so terribly they will hopefully all die off before long.
also like demon slayer or jiu jitsu kaizen
@joel el rican  and many others  they just happened to be what I had been watching
I sure did  I just got stuck and didn t plan ahead well enough on the writing front. Im honestly honored youremember  thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  badass!! im kinda surprised I remembered too  lol
you know thequartering sent me here but Im really happy that took his word and watched you cuz I love how real you talk you seem like an old friend if that makes sense your just really human.
I really appreciate that you add scripture verses to all your videos. thats really awesome! keep it up  chica!
that   dont air your dirty laundry   comment was stupid. these companies have proven time and time again that they dont wont do anything unless there s significant backlash from the outside. they wouldn t care about a single artist s opinion
its like they ve never seen an asian before. making them more round eye d is racist to them. drawing their pupils different invoke emotions in the characters the artist wasn t trying to convey at that point in the story. its not just a redraw. its a rewrite. Imean they re making them look like lizard people
looks like her eyes are glowing in that edit. unnatural feeling.
keep up the great content!
Im not a gamer  Im old  but I enjoy your take on things... plus need to support women in gaming  imho. anyhow  keep up the good work and your makeup always perfect
mel I agree. these people are insane seriously. your doing great though ill always give you a like and watch your vids if they are not too long loll
I d love to see you have conversations with fellow content creators and creative people you know in your field have a collaborative video with krista nova  thatstar wars girl about anything with being a content creator in these times with the mob being hypocrites but   great stuff
so you also outwardly appear righteous to men  but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  - matthew 23 28
and thats why the comic industry is in shambles  because of all this woke bs. thank you mel for all the good work you are doing.
hey melonie. keep being you. its refreshing.
by woke  logic   you shouldn t be or look healthy  take care of yourself or wear anything shapely. you were correct in your prior video  its only really about control.
this is why manga is currently dominating the comic industry
regarding the artist posting about this on twitter  I am reminded of the cliche    the squeaky wheel gets the grease.      nuff said....
jeremy sent me. love commentary channels  like flawdcast  tim pool  quartering  etc. love to see what you have coming in the future!
heya melanie jeremy sent me  I am delighted there is a 30yr age diff. between my oldest and youngest daughters we need more independent strong outspoken young women yes it is a thing like you if you smell it you tell it attitude .pos vibes from dublin
you go woke  you go broke.
glad that jeremy sent me. good perspective and love the scripture at the end. Im here for the long haul.
as far as the partial nudity goes... why wouldn t that be decided ahead of time   obviously there s a limit  so set the boundaries before he even starts.
Im watching your stream with the critical drinker. I agree with you about angelina jolie and I like the first movie more. and I definitely prefer the classic tomb rider not that Im a big fan of the game but at that time all the games were better. its a pity the games look better now.
keep it up love the channel.keep speaking truth we love common sense conservative voices in any entertainment
dont fix it if it ain t broke
melomaniacs should stay  itsounds dope
gaming news and Bible verses ! !amazing!great job!!
thanks for the great content melonie
making commics fun  but that takes talent and effort!
03 24  close up  that girl s face looks like those killer ghosts from japanese horror movies.great job  marvel.
I absolutely love that you do a Bible verse with each video. thank you
is it just me or do some of these changes make the faces look creepy af
virgin marvel bullpen  nooo you cant depict asians like that its insensitive noooochad japanese mangaka  yeah just gonna draw some lines for eyes  basically what we look like anyway
this is a great channel! thanks for the new vids!
quarteringsquad reporting for duty so send this channel to the moon... and beyond!
you should make a Bible based comic! that would be so awesome!
imagine them doing this to an actual actor or actress  to  better represent   insert nationality  race   ethnicity here
this was a great video and highly amusing  but it was the Bible verse at the end that really sealed the  like  for me!
I hoped over from the quartering  and I gotta say I love your stuff!!! also love the tats
so  says she liked tomb raider and the original model  had already put her money where her mouth is and dressed up a full sized model as it and models in the background  seems legit!
just caught you on critical drinker s stream. youre doing awesome stuff. cheers.
the bearded man who shall not be named that put alot of quarters into a claw machine once sent me.
thanks so much  I had a blast!
I like how you integrate Bible versus into your commentary.
so guy draws a pretty accurate representation of japanese people in a tastefully stylized series. marvel goes nope  thats racist  makes the characters look worse. meanwhile  other marvel artists have been caught red handed blatantly tracing   stealing other people s art in their star wars runs. peep eckhartsladder s channel  he has a few videos covering this with tons of evidence in each one  they ll be a few months back in his videos.
word.  as in the word. love the tie-ins.
this is the reason manga keeps winning and itstill will until the current comics industry is burned to the ground!!!
she did a subscribe star!!! she chose correctly.
the corrections are hilarious  I say roll with it
to be honest  I dont need women to be the heroine that pretend to be. the women I respect are the ones who go out there and do what they re gonna do without hollow bravado or some agenda or anything.lara croft doesnt really say what she s gonna do  samus aran doesnt  they just get things done. you are no different. you dont just talk about doing something  you just do it.
nice video  well done.
never bow down or apologize to the woke crowd.
I assume thats laura croft over her left shoulder. kind of in the vein of this vid I think the idea of a  body positive  laura croft hilarious. such as a running jump to a tree branch and the tree collapsing.
I just now saw the Godzilla tattoo  gojira.    pretty awesome easter egg!
ive been watching welyn for so long that when I hear heckin its always in his voice lmfao.
the eyes... like when a rookie photographer decides to lighten   whiten sclera in lightroom or photoshop. unnatural.
who knew that in 60 years the short story harrison bergeron by kurt vonnegut would come true  it is a great story about the government making everyone equal by 2081.  it is online and is a short but a great read. he was off however  by 60 years.  the story was written in 1961.
we all want a beautifull lara croft
often  especially in monochrome the lower eyelids are ignored to emphasie an emotion  such as joy  the edited pics are souless now  devoid of life
here from thequartering channel. youre hilarious  haha  glad I was introduced to the channel
mac rebels shall rise . I love your content on this channel
messing with an artist s work like that is not cool. just one of the many reasons I am not interested in western comics  especially these days. Ive loved manga for nearly 2 decades  though. I think its because I love fantasy  sci-fI  superpowers  and magic  but I tend to prefer stories and settings that dont so closely reflect places and people Im familiar with. even in categories like slice-of-life  the culture and people in manga are different enough to transport me somewhere else. I hope the anime manga industries stay strong and continue giving wokeness the metaphorical middle finger.
dont know way you said the sound was off but itsounds good to me with and without headphones
love my daily dose of melo mac go boom!
marvel   safespace and snowflake  yas this is the shit queeen also  marvel   normal asians  bigoted asian art!  draw them uglier!
I am surprised that I have not had your channels in my recommended feed but I caught your livestream with the critical drinker talking about tomb raider and other things. subbed to both channels.
wow  50  cut  twitch is literally  pimping people.
you can set up a paypal payment too if you want. I know some dont like it but they do not take so much
yo! the quartering sent me over. glad to see a young non woke gamer girl.
un-slant them eyes and open them up a bit  our western audience cant identify with this character! how disappointing they thought they improved his art.
wonderful Bible verse. thank you for this.
I followed u on twitter never watch any of ur vids until today but I do enjoy different opinions on topics
definitely seems like manga is the way to go.
seriously blowing up!
they re like the government at this point... anything they touch turns to shit.
classic case of the emperor has no closes.
great video! there seems to be a high pitched whine in the audio  its pretty audible when you aren t speaking
I think those who cover up nudity or violence in content where such things are appropriate like adult comics games videos etc which kids shouldn t have access too those people censoring such things I would say quite often have immature minds
dang  subscribed at 7k  its now 13k. keep it up!
hI the quartering sent me here  I really enjoyed the video and the Bible reading too. God bless you and pressing the red button.
I love that you put Bible verses in your videos. God bless you.
I love your channel!!
have you considered also posting to rumble or other alt media  Im trying to get away from youtube s censorship and shadowbanning by supporting alt media. I love your channel and would like to follow you on alt media as well.
thank you! yes Imentioned that in my last video and am working on a fix asap
keep staying based melonie
great video keep it up
I dont give 50  to twitch anymore.  the day they removed pogchamp was the last straw.
Im confused  do they want everyone in comics to be white  or look white  I thought we fixed that in the 90 s  I sure am glad I got out and sold aall my books in the early 2000 s. shit is just silly.  backlash  one 300lb blue haired shamu with nothing better to do because they re on disability because  anxiety . love the Bible verses btw  dont stop.
if youre serious about wanting to do a comic. maybe talk to eric july or ethan van scriber   . they should be able to point you in the right direction.
I love the Bible verses at the end
when they changed superman and captain america I knew it was a wrap for comics. this is like disney and their anti-star wars  trilogy  .
love the verse!
yay gonna start a subscribestar account to support you
marvel s standards and practices dept.  should have been around in the 30 s thru 1960 s when marvel blatantly caricatured every race under the sun.  just look at how japanese were depicted in comic books during ww2.
I dont know what youre talking about melonie  giving an asian character googly eyes is a super normal and not racist reaction to  problematic  art.

the western comic and entertainment industry is truly out of touch and creatively bankrupt.is time to start supporting anime manga and independent creators if we wanna start seeing changes.
seems like style a style that the artist is requested to be changed.
manga is the edge Lord compared to western comics. thankfully indie comics are up and coming like the mister e s captain luv series  keung lee s battle maiden knuckle bomb  sick fox studios blade devil and others to be fresh faces for the western comics scene.
didn t they do something similar for me andromeda  like  they tried to make the character models as basic and mundane as possible
I remember when woke actually meant something for the betterment of people. but these loonies have stolen it and twisted it.
as someone who reads comic books and reads the going ons in the industry  marvel doing this doesnt surprise me. after the ardian syaf incident with x-men and lee bermejo s drawings being censored in batman damned. I dont agree with either purely because its censoring ones work.
this is why you need to look into comicsgate... with the mainstream who left...
love your new channel! hey get on rumble and minds please
ahh thanks so much      3

I cant find you in search   the only thing I find is thequarterings vid of you
love the Bible verses. love the content  if it were me I would try to keep the videos around 10 mins.
glad to hear the channel is taking off. welcome to the conversation.
Im quite liking these Bible verses at the end of the videos  and Im not even religious.
melonie mac is pogchamp.you are angry wendigo approved.you get two claws up
I disagree that the security guard  ruined  the painting.  I d pay maybe a fiver for the creepy eyeless face painting  but the one that the guard improved on  a solid twenty bucks.
I like ephesians 6 10 its relevant af.
I think thatsupporting artists is a right thing bc the artists need all the support that they need to be good at stuff  ok melonie. anyway also I think thats what I think bout this topic  ok.also it is ok to have a lady to covering up bc some artists are somewhat different in the style of women that they are drawing bc some artist like the women being naked and some other artists like women being naked. anyway thats my topic of this comment of this video  ok melonie. anyway I do hope you understand what I am saying in this comment and I just dont want be wrong bout what I am saying to you  ok. anyway have a wonderful and great day at the gym and at home with your pets  ok melonie. anyway also stay warm too.
this is why I no longer watch modern movies  tv shows  comics  and other entertainment because the producers feel the need to add in diversity and other woke things into production that the artwork  story  and other qualities suffer so much that the final product is flat out terrible.
@bananaman comment - yaaaa this was brought into public because most likely this was discussed behind the scenes  and they basically told him to go fuck himself. Ive seen this before. you have a back and forth  but the corporation is like  eh just do what we say  who cares.  so  he made it public. its a good thing too because people do notice these kinds of things and he may have been questioned about it.
I appreciate youreading the scriptures.
if anything  these fixes on the girl make her look like a stereotype. the creepy asian child stereotype. nice going marvel.
imo the eyes are filled due to the thickness of pen pencil being used  if you look at the thickness of the drawn lines in the picture vs the wired macro detail added to eyes by the studio  the two dont match at all.
16 42 it is the 31st 21st century and mankind is once again at war. the online battlefields of the future are dominated by huge robotic war machines known as battlemechs keyboards and meme magic. piloting these awesome weapons of war shitposting are men and women  the elite of the elite  knowing that each battle hot take could be their last.they are.  macwarriors . I ll see myself out.
Im part of the melonie mac army baby!!
this is one of the reasons why I dont like current comics. they make everyone sexless  androgynous or unattractive. they like to self-insert themselves into their books a lot as well. also the current level of artists and stories seem much lower. I read only old back issues from when they were still good  many years ago   and manga.
user interaction for algo. keep it up.
if they really wanted to fix the mistake  pull the edited prints and move on. seems like that isn t too hard to do for a company like marvel
this is why comics are in the gutter because it belong there. and manga is taking leaps and bounds in sales and market share.
mc rebels or mac rebels  still fun either way. keep on rockin
well  gun Jesus  aka ian from forgottenweapons channel  has started using utreon dot com  which is a fully functional platform that is a mix of patreon and youtube. might be worth looking into it.
if okies are from oklahoma. where are wokies from.  someone could do a song parody to the tune of  okie from muskogee .
12 35 see there s that double edged sword. he says that this is all around unprofessional but then when it comes to the incredibly hostile and profanity ridden  in some cases  editorials on right wing people in mainstream newspapers that is in no way unprofessional or uncalled for thats just good stuff there. and guarantee this dude would not think this was unprofessional if it was an activist mob trying to get marvel to change what they considered racist art.
itseems to me as if someone is making these changes to justify their paycheck.
the first - before anyone mentioned anything about race  my first thought was oh   I see the difference marvel made it look more asian.   so in other words lets do blackface so we dont stereotype african american   great work marvel googlieyed people are totally being represented
you cant call it marvel anymore. they identify as disney.
alright  Im a proud macrebel  then. we re the real resistance too. we dont have the same opinions as the television here.
branch out odesse  bit chute and rumble.
insert  dont buy my x  meme ahaha
using racism and sexism to make 20 something busy bodies who dont read comics feel good about not being racist and sexist. makes sense.
large breasted women dont exist apparently to many in the west. its like that journo screaming meme with the big breasted woman pressing against the door window
as a former comic book artist myself  in my opinion  its all very underwhelming work   even the original. its too  new agey  with this current misguided emphasis on natural movements and perspectives  which is draining the dynamism from modern comic books. modern comics are no longer fulfilling avenues for the penciller to practice his craft in. there s a misguided ideology plaguing modern comic books thatsays the art must look more like hollywood storyboards than the explosive iconography artists such as jack kirby  todd mcfarlane  and jim lee pioneered. not the traditional imagery of american comic books where proportions are exaggerated  and the storytelling is amplified by extreme perspectives   camera angles   to heighten the drama.there s sooooo much wrong with contemporary comic books. its thoroughly endemic by now  it has infected all aspects of the medium. like everything else broken in our culture today  comics followed the same lead thats ruined the entertainment industry by embracing the same entropic belief that asserts progress is the outright rejection for the things that made longstanding intellectual properties so beloved in the first place.the embittered cynics we call  academics  on our college campuses have pulled a very dirty trick on the impressionable youth by convincing them every single aspect of american society is horrible  evil  and unfair. they are being trained to automatically consider what is obvious and universal for making something successful is actually wrong. that real enlightenment is to do the exact opposite of what has been done before in order to attain true brilliance.
marvel and dc both need a complete housecleaning and fire everyone  then hire some old-school style writers  artists and editors  pre-sjw era folks.
Imean if you look at traditional japanese art  they depicted themselves that way....
other than spider-man and moon knight  I dont read marvel.  I certainly dont read anything dc.  I quit for the most part 2 years ago.  I recently got back into spawn.  that is pretty good.  but I refuse to support the woke agenda.
marvel says make the eyes rounder lol
as an artist with an acute sense of the absurd  I would suggest the macremnant   romans 11 1-5 esv I ask  then  has God rejected his people  by no means! for Imyself am an israelite  a descendant of abraham  a member of the tribe of benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. do you not know what the scripture says of elijah  how he appeals to God against israel   Lord  they have killed your prophets  they have demolished your altars  and I alone am left  and they seek my life.  but what is God s reply to him   I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to baal.  so too at the present time there is a remnant  chosen by grace.
we are the mcrebels!
and here I thought I was the only one to use the word  heckin  .  d
dig the illustration!!
these are ridiculous times. something like what marvel did would be a comedy in the 90 s jajaja
thats hilarious  Im part muskogee creek indian
or macrebels!
marvel looks like the same type of people who would  fix  manga anime art.
everything I dont like is woke.
melo mac go boom is the best thing in 2022
marvel need a vacation to asia
eye of the beholder  behold without judgement.
welcometotherebellion
f yeah! you and the drinker!
I can see why the artist complained....the first panel from marvels edit looks like xI  winnie pooh  jinping...
this is why I by and large have stopped reading comic books.
the quartering says hello.
maybe sell some art  or take on commissions

googley eyes for everyone! lol
subbed on recomendation  staying because based
we got your back. keep up what youre doing.

wtb mcrebbels shirt!
amazing content  happy valentine  day almost
now a Bible verse at the end of each video as if its not to trigger  them  all the harder.
ooh good idea  I will start doing that!
haven t read the comic  but evidently marvel wants to highlight the fact that the little girl is a zombie...
I think marvel is trying to transition to comedy. Imean that is the only logical explanation for their recent art and comicbooks. its... comical.
the airplane thumbnail lmao
I like how marvel thought drawing asians with asian features was racist so they tried to make them look more  white    lol. insert dj khalid  you played yourself  meme.
your face on the plane in your thumbnail reminds me of miley cyrus s face in the murdoch murdoch videos...
jeremy pointed me your way. new subscriber here
need the madagascar penguins  we did it boys! we solved racism! edit   why did you do this in public  it gives my com er its a bad look!  -totally not a marvel employee sock accountedit again   dont be a dick!  -chadicus 23 19is this the macrebel base
no no let them keep destroying the ip they own. it will just make them hemorage money. artists will find there way like they always have.
if there s any more proof that good artists aren t appreciated  its that 1mil painting of total trash kindergarten art vs. the marvel artist drawing hundreds of beautiful panels for a fraction of that price and then getting shit on...and ppl wonder why artists are so damn pissed all the time.
this is exactly the type of dirty laundry that needs to be aired in public. mel what happened to your direct dono link
marvel really was like  this isn t woke enough  it needs to be more racist!
need to boycott them  its the only way to make them change
is the marvel bullpen using ms paint  good Lord.
I wanna see the marvel bullpen do brock from pokemon
farvel cant compete so they trash artwork doesnt surprise me in the slightest.  farvel is ruled by fisney which is run by emperor mickey or is it empress minnie now running fisney which is why I dont give them anything.  amen .  hmm are the mac rebels part of the drunk 3po rebellion
Im no simp  but dear God  you are beautiful
ok originally I was just gonna leave a comment for the algorithm and go to bed but. 3 08 oh dear God  why  yeah no  anyone who has spent more than a couple dozen hours sketching after their formative years should know better. how the hell does that editor have a job!
welcome to the rebellion
marvel is basically now saying they have a problem with the way asians look.
huh  made a comment about fan support providers like sub star and patr30n. but it got algorithmed  s
bahaha!
also get ublock origin extension
the salty army is legion.
aren t most comments about  marry  and  me
less gooooo!
commenting to feed the algorithm
when they pay you to find racism youre going to find racism.
hey female jeremy
if you feel the need to change a artist work then you shouldn t be using it.
soooo basically they made the asian kid look more white... because woke... makes sense.
I am not an artist.   thatsaid  regarding the first three before   after drawing comparisons show in this video   the changes made to those drawings seem so subtle to me  I honestly do not see the point of making them at all.  especially since anyone reading the comic would only see the edited version of the images  not the originals.
3
I wanted to ask you about your voice compared to the first video you made on this channel  itsounds like you are to close to crying on all other videos except that first one. has something happened or are those different sound settings on the mic maybe
marvel is too scared of the woke mob
marvel  we cant be accused of racism if we make everyone look the same racemodern problems require modern solutions
pretty lady have big brain.me like.
am here from the quartering
its like marvel just looked at it and decided how racist can Imake this look. wtf
Imeant to say 40 s thru 60s.  marvel was what...  founded 1938ish
marvel and dc feel dead to me. used to buy comics every week  then every month  now its never. but at least they get to virtue signal  franco belgian comics are awesome though and everyone needs to start reading them.
why do people even still read comics from these companies
hey there  just came from the quartering to sub.
indeed!
Im not close to crying  I just turned the mic up because it was too quiet in the first one lol
@melonie mac go boom  oh okay I was just curious
bahaha
many asians would be offended with ugly corrections. plenty of asians are ok with the art like that
do you have a p.o. box
Im so done with marvel.
these are clearly paid professionals. professionals in the art of being offended. because there is no way a normal person would see this and think that there s anything offensive on those panels. like  youreally have to try to find something offensive there. you would have to pay me a lot  and Imean  a lot of money to waste my time like that. this is just stupid  man.
rebels..... nah..... clan mac
cool
following Jesus makes you a rebel today!
how about matthew 7 5
I dont understand the changes... are the marvel artists trying to say asians have beady little eyes
cant wait for the next character they turn gay to make people forget about this.
maybe he should resubmit the asians to resemble how wb portrayed the japanese in the wwiI propaganda   bugs bunny nips the nips .....
minImacs
woke culture is satire.
the fixes look uglier. says a lot about what marvel really thinks.
as someone who loves drawing  these marvel edits made no sense at all and also very disrespectful towards the original artist. nothing from the original work is offensive. this is a non issue really.also its a style the artist is going for and it looks awesome.
its not racist. superman is draw with black dots as eyes. I can see someone like adding the white to the eyes but thats a personal choice.
thats kind of ridiculous... what in the world do these minute changes improve  in the end we are talking about art. ...within tolerance of best representation of asian characters  are you f  kidding me  look at 90  of manga and anime of the last 3 decades! every artist has a totally different approach to artistically interpret and highlight certain ethnic features. oftentimes even leading towards very unique and popular art styles for a whole genre!now I can understand that artists have to do revisions at times  but honestly these have to have reasonable explanations. artistic freedom  anyone at marvel ever heard of that if this kind of manipulation continues  it will destroy the inherent uniqueness of art itself and strip it of all its value. this is not what art is about!thank God da vincI and other great artists of the past  didn t have to face this level of petty ignorance.on a side note  the gaming industry is already suffering of the same  in box thinking  when it comes to art and style. just sickening.
marvel trying to get in competition with 4kids of who can make the most unnecessary and laziest edits ever.
fighting racism with more racism  great job marvel political office.
Im surprised you pulled up a Bible verse melanie. you trying to become a Christian  because if so I like it.
@toaster  having faith is far from gullible and takes a lot of courage today. you even proved my point  just mentioning following Jesus and you were compelled to take a cheap shot at me.
narrow is the way and few there are that find it always reminds me to look around and if Im going the way of the crowd Im going the wrong way
first! yes!ok  time to watch the video now.
hI again! my new favorit.
everything woke turns to poo.
what are your thoughts on islam
an clownish alteration made for even more clownish reasons.
wow... have we really fallen so far that facial expressions can now be racist  this is insane...
is that a laura croft cosplay in the back
did they round eye the asians
get paypal and crypto addresses too
colaborate with joe rogan
careful...questioning proprietary corporate algorithms threatens the very fabric of democracy
so basically male feminist wanna control or bone women and probably both. absolutely waste of space
the real Bible verse that applies to this story is john 11 35
have you seen the show peacemaker on hbo  its is a sort of spin off from the suicide squad. it would  be really good except that there is a lot of woke agenda bullshit mixed in. im my opinion it totally ruins the show. very sad. why is marvel and dc ruining all my favorite super hero shit
thats almost funny how badly they changed it  what a great idea to let a much worse artist go loose on it. and if their reasons was for some muh raycys its even more stupid. I dont want to support anything marvel anymore they ruin everything.
this is the kind of crap that is ruining the comic industry. there shouldn t be a  standards and practices  department at marvel. thats ridiculous. if they hire an artist to do a job  let them do the job. marvel shouldn t be going in afterwards and changing or editing anything. that defeats the entire point of having the artist in the first place. this is so disrespectful to an artists vision. this is the kind of stupid executive oversight that does more harm than good. in their attempt to cleanse anything remotely controversial from the work to appease a specific audience  that likely isn t even buying the comics in the first place  they are literally destroying the trust with creators of their products. what good is it down the road if your company has a reputation for disrespecting their artists at the cost of a fraction of consumer satisfaction. they will no longer be able to attract talented artists in the first place and then they ve not only lost the artists but they have alienated the fanbase of each of those artists. it creates this domino effect of destruction all in the name of looking out for 1 groups interest. its just insanity. they need to keep their hands out of the artists work and just respect their creative vision in its entirety. they would earn far more trust and sales by standing up against the mob instead of trying to appease it.
how is it racist to draw asian features on an asian. the only thing thatseems racist is the fact they edited the asian characters with european features. woke culture is a never ending paradox.
dont you have a yt channel already  why start this new one  because of the change in theme  or did you lose your login info  aahahahahah
why did they hate that the asian girl looked asian  isn t that racist  I swear replacing asian features on an asian character with caucasian features is racist not having an asian character look asian.
probably someone just trying to justify their job. changing someone s art that you paid for seems pretty ridiculous. it looks like crappy paint edits. haha
ok
@straight white fatherly figure  I see you are new to the internet. this is a thing that has been going on for many many years. but  mainly a callback to a previous video of hers thatsomeone else typed it and I said they cheated. thanks for the comment though.
@codenomics  buddy  my youtube account is 13  years old. yours is 3. lmaoI just think that these kind of comments are pretty old and lame. just my opinion
@straight white fatherly figure  since age of accounts matters to you for some reason  I will switch to my older account. not sure what age of accounts has to do with time on the internet  but alright  I have seniority now. I have been connecting to remote servers since it required a cradle and a direct connection for a bbs. yeah  they are pretty old and really lame when done as a serious thing. you have the right to your opinion  but the fact that you felt such a need to say it and then to see how old my  other account was says a lot about you. you have a nice day and stop stressing on others  comments lol.
stop the fighting!! youre triggering me and reminded me of all the arguments my family had at Christmas times!
@michael quaid  I use alcohol for those times lolol
@first last  it doesnt  I just debunked your claim of me being new to the internet. you can stop replying to me now  all I said was  ok .
@codenomics
my entire backdrop is an assortment of lara croft statues  including one massive one haha
@melonie mac go boom  ahh ty  dude a life size statue is cool af. wish I had one of solid snake from metal gear.
you even believe in the Bible man  perfect girl.
you could help by drawing more thing son your body. the more the better. yo should get full sleeves and legging and especially your face! tats on a girls face always makes her gorgeous  specially of skulls  dragons  and rodents. only the most intelligent and pretty people get tats all over their body.
sup
this is why comics from marvel are dead.  alternative comics are on the rise.  eric july s comic company for example  and shad s shadow of the conqueror comics are doing great  because they are not complying with the woke trash people s demands.   and yes  anyone following the woke agenda is trash imo. Im done being even the slightest bit accepting of their garbage.
yeah. this was dumb.
that retouch is absolute trash. and actually racist.
