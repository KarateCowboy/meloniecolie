netflix cannot turn this anime into live action  you need a marvel or dc budget and we know netflix cant do that and thats not even saying anything about the horrible writing you know they will bring to it.  also  this season of my hero has been absolutely insane and intense so far.
oh yes  live action. where franchises go to die.
netflix needs to just leave anime alone
fans  netflix we would love a great anime adaption.netflix  sure  here is a good one made for modern audiences with all of our important messaging.
this is the first Im hearing of it.  are they going to make bakugo s hero name boom-boom boy and justify it as something he needs to do to overcome his pride
we already have live action my hero academia  its called sky high. also isn t japan already making their own live action adaptation of my hero academia
the main problem is the story just wouldn t fit into a feature length film.  to do it justice you have to show how he met all might  saved bakugo and the training he has to go through to earn all might s approval.  in a netflix film that would be limited to a 30 minute first act so that they could get on to the  real dramatic moments  fighting stain or the league of villains.  with those limits deku s training would be a three minute montage to eye of the tiger at best and that will leave him feeling like a mary sue.
I dont think you have to worry about momo yaoyorozu being portrayed by a teenage actress. I believe its very rare that hollywood casts a teen actor as a teen character. usually they cast a young looking twenty-something actor to play a teen.
even japan does live action adaptations of animes better than the us. I remember being quite impressed by the jojo diamond is unbreakable live action movie. even if they changed some things around in the story progression  the characters were  for the most part  very accurate to their animanga depiction  the stands looked very nice and I do like that they gave a bit more focus to josuke s grandfather and made angelo look more...mysterious  more tortured  but still evil af  instead of dog muncher.
the words netflix and adaption are always a warning sign
I do belive turning an anime into live action can work depending on the anime. anime like my hero and one piece are way to large and would require a heavy amount of cgi. so if they would want to adapt it while being respectful they would have to change it drastically
you know  I watched this anime and as I watched the first few episodes I felt that this is exactly how I would use the book to purge the world of evil. and then the rest of the anime happened which challenged my way of thinking. I love this show for doing that. also anime live action are nothing new. japan had tried it for ages with disastrous results. which is why I find it amazing someone thought this was a good idea to begin with.
the japanese live action stage play was actually pretty good considering it was  you know  a stage play  so it can be done.thatsaid  I have -0.001  faith that netflix could make a even quarter decent live action anything at this point.
I 100  agree with your take with light  about taking the mask off.  and Ive seen that happen in real life when people  change  once they achieved a certain power or freedom to do so.  and I cantell that the person was always like that.  they just couldn t say what they were thinking  or do what they wanted in their previous situation.
at this point it cant be anything else but intentional. they are even willing to lose money to harm these ips. thats real hate.
Imean there were japanese actors in Godzilla with ken watanbe s character  wish they didn t kill him off but his scene with Godzilla as he sacrificed himself was very powerful  but while Godzilla originated in japan the dude has attacked numerous cities across the world throughout the movies so I dont mind if they diversify it as long as they respect the japanese roots.
this is exactly why the metro story has not been adapted to screen yet. multiple times the writer has gotten offers for either a film or a show but the producers wanted to change it alot  one going so far as setting it in washington d.c.. I cant speak for the other seasons as I haven t watched them yet  sort of just appeared one day so I didn t see them come out  but the live action fma was pretty good. I felt like it was a direct 1 1 with what I had seen before just with sick real world visuals.
netflix definitely has those board meetings like you talked about in the beginning of the video. except they re totally unaware. they think  oh fans will love us for  reimagining  this franchise for a more modern and progressive audience! even though it has yet to work after the 500th time  you know what they say  501st time s a charm!
I can already see how it will end in a huge fire. especially if netflix has enough balls to satisfy some of the fan requests from twitter.
100  agree with you on the whole friend circle thing. I always used to say  you are who you hang with   we are constantly altering and adapting due to the choices we and those closest to us make. my best friend and I have been pretty much inseparable since we were 12  I often look back at all we ve been through the past 17 years and how we ve changed over that time. but mostly just wondering how we re still alive.
they ll still do it. and it will fail  people will continue to b!7ch and complain and yet still keep paying them.
exactly if anything is just make it worse. the problem is they do have good tv shows and movies but the problem is is that you cant control what they spend the money for your subscription. for instance I saw two maybe three really good brand new installments to their lineup and they were really good in my opinion. so even if I am upset with them about making an installment of something I actually care about it doesnt really help to just cancel my subscription because of that alone. thats why I have to live by the karma philosophy. when they do good stuff they get a lot of people to subscribe to their service. when they do it bad they hurt themselves. but frankly at this point I feel like netflix is now divided between actual business people and just mentally deficient f   tard who dont care how much they burn down the building as long as their message or opinions is let loose into the world because God knows nobody wants to hear them in real life or on social media .lol
let s face it big budget doesnt always equal good creative skills  good creative skills equals original thought and deviation from the plot  superhero movies series lack both  superhero  villain end of the world equals world saved  not much else you can do with the superhero genre.
I agree  it will fail  miserably.
thanks for keeping the meme alive subscribers.
@earendur von einzbern  your comment will go right over these people s heads  unfortunately.
except maybe alice in borderlands but the anime only had like 3 so I guess its different
@bowsette  main reason I stay subbed is for the korean rom coms in all honesty.  not a lot being made in north america worth watching these days.
I dont think anyone canturn this anime into live action. some things are best left untouched. and anime is so stylised it d very difficult to adapt most of them I d say.
they also trashed cowboy beebop
I dont believe that fair because legendary pictures have proven they could do a good job with a japanese property take a look at Godzilla for instance how much money did those movies make in the box office and yes they were made by america legendary pictures deserves a chance to take on anime manga property like my hero academia
mha is already dying anyway lol manga is close to end too thats why they wanna cash in money rn
@saro v  eh I doubt its gonna end just the end of the afo vs ofa ark with all the stuff they interoduced like mha vigilantes and world ending threats outsid afo with humanitas they have a universe to keep setting future works in a true replacement for the dying dc comics.
at least on netflix  youre 100  correct.
@saro v  its not dieing. just because a manga ends doesnt mean it dies. if that was the case they would not be making a live action yu yu hakusho  or avatar.  they wouldn t have made a live action rurounI kenshin. end and die are diffrent things.  overall though it doesnt matter netflix doesnt have the money for something like mha.
@kari  I remember it rumored years sgo
but you seem to forgot that netflix is not the only one working on this project what about legendary pictures you just ignoring them because they re the ones that got the rights to my hair academia not netflix the other day netflix has the right is too stream it on their platform
@animezilla 44  either way all I am saying is anime needs pushed from america  because the people doing comics now are making batman and super man gay all because   of how woke anime is. I stopped watching anime  because something about it didnt seem right  and im like 35 years old  so its not normal to be doing that.
honestly  its not the budget  its the story and the unwillingness to stay faithful to it because  its fine  we have editors for that .what hollywood fails to realize is that they cannot do that with ongoing anime.  not because its a stupid thing to do  art can certainly be improved from time to time  but because the manga that drew people in has essentially telephoned through edits from the authors intended storyline  to the web novel edit  the manga edit  the anime edit  the translation edits  and finally the live action.  you can see the problem this creates in series like got.... and that was just assuming how best to end a series by people who speak the same language  these editors dont have a clue how these series end  anything they do  from casting to wardrobe to censorship  can and does completely fuck the eventual ending  and then they usually need to hire someone less talented to write their own ending to a story they never would have written  that indeed no author might have ever tried writing because the underlying concepts are foreign to the editor  while the edits concepts are foreign to the author.  it makes them completely separate works requiring lightning to strike twice in similar places for different reasons.
bebop had enough budget but cant save it cause ther is freedom in animation u cant get in la same for one piece it gets near a marvel show budget each epis but I dont think it could save it even lets see
you forget. netflix isn t making the movie  they re only platforming it. legendary pictures  the ones who made the Godzilla movies  are the ones actually making it. dont bash on netflix because they decided to platform it  bash the studio actually making the movie
they can if they do what mortal kombat did more fighting than powers . I could see stain storyline working out very well but that probably wont be the storyline they pick.
@bowsette  like you
especially when characters with mutant-type quirks exist  like tsuyu and shoji. either they cut some of the best characters entirely to save on costs or they spend more than they can afford to include them. to say nothing of the spectacle they need to produce for even the most mundane quirks  unless its minetta s .there s no conceivable way this can work in their favour even from a visual perspective.
people just need to drop their subscriptions.
@bowsette  they already did. I dont know why you thinking most people here still have em. also  dropping subscriptions isn t doing shit. netflix is still making trash regardless.
and videogames like gears of war or resident evil
@bowsette  dropped mine a good long while ago
their original anime is pretty good. its just turning popular anime into liveaction.
Ive been saying this for years now.if the superhero craze had been milked out  they ll gravitate towards games and anime.notice the gaming awards had holloweird personalities migrating towards itspecially ruin johnson promoting his crap and other actors getting caat in games.after that they have an alternative making stories for influenceer gen z stuff.
netflix needs to leave all adaptation alone
only one has done well
netflix needed to go out of business after they created  cuties
it gives the anime studio an infusion of cash  it will flop on netflix and new casuals will go to check out the original material which will be win for the anime manga studio.
what will we make fun of then
@anderclips  good point
netflix needs to leave everything alone
fr  or at the very least they should just help fund a good animated movie for that property.
the anime industry as a whole is in an abusive relationship with netflix while they would be better off just filing a restraining order against them.
@eatwave  they have sone but most are awful
we ve had netflix for well over a decade  and back when it was the only streaming service that mattered  it was fantastic.  my wife still wants to keep netflix for one remaining current show... the other 30  we ve cared about are long gone  without a foreign vpn .  regardless  Im counting down the days we get rid of netflix for good.  thanks obama.
@bowsette  haven t had netflix since 2018. might also drop my subscription for paramount and disney plus.
@raul rosas  cuties was created by a french company....

lol wrong. no one asked for a live action anime adaptation period.
brought to you by our sponsors.
brave and stunning
@blacklives orblackvotes  speak for yourself I did
what about legendary pictures you haven t even mentioned them they re the ones that got the right to the series not netflix
no one wants anime adaptations. the original anime is great. leave it alone
netflix is full of low production  gender lgbt diversity casting  story that doesnt follow the books or games or anime or manga. their titles based on whatever is popular.
probably
well  that does sound really dumb  so I wouldn t be surprised if they did. they re really good at doing really dumb shit.
maybe do a 180 of his personality and emasculate him like fred from scooby doo  or a black kid who s misunderstood because of his skin color so he lashes out at society but then deku appreciates him for him and they form a gay couple to fight against the straight white villain
@kos gaming  I really hate what they ve done to fred. completely screwed up the dynamic of the group. nothing after what s new scooby doo era is canon to me
@even in death I still serve  roflmao...true.
dont give netflix any ideas lest they put bakudeku in there
fans   who are you  bakugo   im boom boom boy reeeeeeeeeeee!!!
bomberman
bakugo is a shit character so it wouldn t matter to me how he is portrayed in live action
@ben lewis  I agree ben lewis hollywood needs to leave anime alone sadly they wont do this we just make sure their woke adaptations fail so they will go broke and wont be able to do anymore
yes but its only a play
@cj gamer  oh  thats right
I love sky high man  such an underrated movie! I also see the correlation between it and mha.
@alpha stoutland  yoooo I love the movie too
also deku s hero journey works so well because the villians and rivals he s facing have been built up very well before they ever fight him.  there s no way they could build up stain into anything worth remembering within the span of a movie unless he was the focus of the entire movie. even then  they would just say  oh so stain is just like joker  and give us a japanese themed clown.
honestly the best way to do this is just make its own filler movie in live action like ben 10 did twice I think.that way if it bombs people can just say its non canon.
if they intend to do multiple movies it could work. kenshin live action movies did that.
but a live action movie worked so well for dragonball....
I actually tried to watch the live action fma movie  and I agree  dont just shoehorn an entire season of 20  episodes into a 90-120 minute clusterfuck.
and youre wrong. ever heard of initial d  wicked city  patlabor  these were garbage adaptations and made by japanese studios.I also guess you never heard of the french live adaptation of city hunter has gotten tons of praise from anime fans.
@gloria thomas  well the more you know
@3 slices senpai  you are wrong in some level japan has a lot of bad live action anime products they did those two attack on titan movies and fullmetal alchemist
@gloria thomas  I d argue those are all still far better than what netflix has been doing to destr0y everything  although your point is well made.
facts
I guess hulu  amazon prime  or hbo max should have made this movie
I agree ! if the source material doesnt have a crazy power level  its easy. but when you start getting to dragon ball  black clover etc. it requires wayyy to much cgI the only live action anime media I liked was the  ruruonI kenshin movies
the only one Ive seen is alice in borderlands
the crows zero movies are great
I think violet evergarden could be adapted  but it d have to be serious and a little bit dark. and a show about a girl wanting to write love letters combined with bloody war scenes might not go over so well with the normie audience.
I agree with you thats why I have faith in this project because legendary pictures is also behind this considering how they doing well with Godzilla I think they deserve a chance for my hero academia
yeah  Im worried for one piece. luffy s  netflix s live adaptation of one piece  basic attacks are going to require a lot of cgi. I can only imagine what characters like chopper  kuma  moria  etc are going to look like.
true  the anime could work. the problem is that  some people think that japan would do it better  however a lot of japanese live action takes are just as bad as the american ones.
@ethan golston  its hard to adapt
@ethan golston  ooof.... remember the attack on titan live action movie  now that was a stinker!
@lizard81288  the one piece live action really worries me. not just luffy but half of his crew would require cgI in some form. and let s not forget the sizes and races of other characters in the one piece world.
yeah  the studio better have fat wallets if they want to make live action adaptations of nearly all the more popular anime like mha or one piece  especially if they plan to just make the characters real life.  an anime like black lagoon would work since there s not much fictional material  rock doesnt turn into a mutant and revy doesnt shoot lasers from her hands
you must be talking about in japan.
I love the goofy japanese humour in mha. I cant see them capturing that in an american live action movie.
you are absolutely correct  if they want to make live action of anime manga hire japanese team just look at the live adaptation of  samuraI x  it was well made movie.
my only hope there is legendary. other than that  Im not sure if this concept will translate well to live action  due to how diverse the characters look. Imean  all might s hair alone is going to look weird af.
its a great day! gym in the morning and a new video from melonie in the afternoon. looking very lovely today  melonie!
I dont want to see what hollywood would do to characters like momo or miss midnight. I foresee terms like  body positivity  and  the male gaze  being thrown around too much.
their opinion on changing other people s culture is the same as their opinion on all other artistic media.  its okay when we do it.  is essentially their creed.
its not just that we re woking better than they are  its that when we do it  it actually makes sense  and that we re not even trying to be woke.
I see the netflix anime adaptation meme is alive and well.
youre so right about anime. I gravitate to it more and more  because it just entertains. read some andrew doyle about wokeism as religion. he s written a whole book on it called  the new puritans.
news flash  it doesnt  ruin  the anime  if a live-action version is made  regardless of whether or not one doesnt like it. cowboy bebop was not ruined because of the live action version.
9 35  this!! thanks for saying such a timeless piece of truth  melonie!
well  a Godzilla tangent is a nice change  lol. Im already predicting sex race changes for a bunch of characters. maybe bakugo Ive been rewatching deathnote recently. so good. I refuse to watch the netflix version.tomorrow s video should be a banger  it always is when you do some extra prep. edit  oh  I tagged you on an article about stargate that talks about the mindset of why they keep doing this stuff.
if this keeps up you couldn t pay me to watch netflix.
to be fair. plenty of people watch anime sure  but these live actions aren t for the existing fans. they are for the non-fans and these live actions will be a lot of people s first exposure to this content.
I love what legendary has done with Godzilla. I think its an incredible idea for the monsterverse to go in the way of mcu dc lot of material to work with. so long as Godzilla dont go  woke  I ll lose my shit.
boom goes the dynamite....into the hopes and dreams of a decent live action adaptation of my hero academia...
the first time I watched ultraman in spanish  I was shocked on how different it was from the version we got in america.
guess I ll have to get into it before they ruin it.
I have been watching my hero academia saturdays on the cartoon network  and its a pretty cool story.  its building up to a major confrontation  and Im eager to see how it turns out. I dont need to subscribe to netflix when I have the real thing available on cable for no extra cost. yashahime is also very good.  its by the creator of ranma and maison ikkoku. one piece is amusingly bizarre.   woking  is not just a new term  its the name of a city in england that was destroyed by the martians during the victorian era.
you are right about the whole thing with death note  a lot of people missed that message. I know there are a lot of messages people miss with in anime  when it comes down to it. but I kind of just laid back on watching any of it anymore  because netflix  and people missing the messages in the shows. I really wish people would stop cheering on dudes feeling pain due to problems in their love lives or them not being able to find love and lashing out  most times if men did that in real life we would go to jail or get killed. thats the part that your seeing that most people dont  like with chainsaw man you understand that hes seeking love and intamentcy  most people dont look at it that way  and that is also another reason I kind of stopped watching anime.
they re definitely going to make them obese like those weird fan arts!
@asylum117  if those weirdo shippers are in charge of the project
@mike q  Im pretty sure they will. now days western entertainment industry dont hire actual competent   smart writers anymore.
yes  Im very much looking forward to tomorrows video. Imean Im always looking forward to melonies video ngl. but tomorrows sounds very interesting.
Ive been saying this for years now.if the superhero craze had been milked out  they ll gravitate towards games and anime.notice the gaming awards had holloweird personalities migrating towards itspecially ruin johnson promoting his crap and other actors getting caat in games.after that they have an alternative making stories for influenceer gen z stuff.also on  what you said is always in japanese media for decades now since otaku culture lacks the companionship and the issue of japans low in population thats why this plots exist.  thirsty men always in japanese writing its their lewd culture  they literally have myth and Gods embodies that.
@norman readdis  well I didn t watch the video game awards I was stuck at work. but yeah I really turned away from anime 1 because Im too old for it. 2 all the stories feel the same  and nobody  makes different ones. last time I watch anime was cyberpunk. but I found other things to do  to use my time different. but I think its just because I have grown up. not saying that its bad but sometimes we just grow out of things  as well. most of the anime I watched was from my early 20s or so.  but yea a lot of people here in america lack compassion  and will allow good people to suffer  for there very own selfishness.
@nosaj ttimmed what cyberpunk  the edge runners one  thats not an anime. its just commissioned to animate in japan but it was never an anime like rwby  they re western writen ips that only looks like an anime.
@nosaj ttimmed gotta agree most degeneracy thats been in the west came from anime from yurI  yaoI  futa  shippers  benders  beasties  furries  creepers  lolicons  ecchis etc. but it takes a good sense of person to separate it from reality  weebs mostly are the victim of this blurring of reality. also keep in mind media exist for japanese to escape the harsh life in japan loke how the west read fanstasy books or comics for escapism  its not exclusive to japanese media. western weebs think they can  relate  but the dont and just on the trend bandwagon since anime famous.
@norman readdis  yup  anime is teaching young people bad things  as well as good things. we never really hear anything about God in these shows.
@norman readdis  or Jesus for that matter.
@norman readdis   commisioned to animate in japan  hence its anime  anime is just cartoons made in japan
@nosaj ttimmed saldy youre just getting old.honestly what I am today and my way of being a fsther is because of what I watch in anime. most shounen teaches you courage and responsibility. just dont watch anything other than that category. below the iceberg is the bad part of anime and manga. like everything else even west had shady books like it from stephen king with that final ritual chapter. also most japanese are shintoists and they really shown it in their stories  dont expect Christianity in it.
@they said Im asian there s a classification to what an anime is.real  anime  should be written in japan  originated in japan and made for japan. being made in japan isn t classified it as  anime  or japanese media. sure japanese people generalized all as animation  anime  but they know their own craft and will distinguish what s theirs and what s overseas ip. thats the misconceptions of this terms. even the manga author that run from office is making sure their  anime  is never be touch by western corporations.
why do we need a live action adaptation show for every anime... its a anime for a reason...
it would be a lie if I said any thing less than   my hero academia made me into a better man. its rare to encounter a fictional work of art  in this era of the us  that leaves a bigger impression on you than japanese anime manga and korean manhwa. if thatsuper volcanoe over at indonesia goes off  it will create a cultural dark age across the planet.
Im looking forward to the uzumakI show. adult swim toonamI are having it done by a japanese company.
its funny that I come across this video I just started watching my hero academia. I just started watching s1 ep.3 and so far Im liking it.
we need to take hollywood movies and make  adaptations
with the Godzilla films I think they could make each film take place in different part of the world with different human characters. what I think of the hollywood films. still like them  huge Godzilla fan.
they will learn this lesson once the one piece live action drops.... God willing!
yay!!! they are going to ruin another fav anime  why!!!!!  I like mha. but I agree with you. have a japanese company do it.Im looking forward to your woke video. but these people making these live action adaptations dont seem to get the point behind the source material. and instead try to push some dumb woke agenda. good video. thank you for the information. youre looking cute. have a good day melonie
hey  mel! Im not familiar with this anime  but  seeing that thumbnail has given me chills of aversion.
I dont know if its we re woke ing better than they are.
they probably relate more to light yagamI  so they d want to justify his actions.
when they bought Godzilla there were some strict clauses on  how to use the  monster
how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man !
well  legendary did keep some of its japanese roots. the first arc in the first Godzilla movie happens in japan. the bgm that plays when Godzilla is on the screen  specially in king of monsters  has many japanese motifs. I believe it was respectfully adapted...but back at the topic at hand  definitely wont watch bnha live action xd. even if they keep it respectful towards the original source  I dont really like live actions...
why is her pronouncing his name as day-kou so funny to me
toho is making a Godzilla movie for next year. also legendary is supposed to be making a live action gundam movie for netflix.
Im just continue watching the anime and reading the manga
the only one I have some hope for is one piece  but that is because oda is directly involved. also melonie  how much of this is due to japanese corporations that own the rights to a lot of animes because they love that netflix money  it just seems to me a lot of corporate decisions instead of the artist
hImelonie thanks for always bringing on your opinions onthese topics.I hope your weekend whent relaxing for u takecare melonie
netflix didn t learn a thing from the bombs of death note and cowboy bebop.
@norman readdis  yes but I think people are affected by it. I actually did reseach on the subject.
@norman readdis  so did marvel and dc back then  now super man and batman are both turning gay.
@nosaj ttimmed  considering Christianity makes up about 2  of the japanese population  there s no surprise there. for that matter  you dont hear much about God or Jesus in american or european productions other than very generic references that are specifically tailored to not offend anyone  you will not see a Christian character in any major movie talk about opposition to gay marriage or abortion due to beliefs rooted in the Bible . other than movies that are specifically produced for a Christian audience by a Christian studio  which heavily limits their reach.
@nosaj ttimmed everything is affected by something  its not just anime. its just anime is mainstream nowadays. Im more concerned about tiktok affecting the youth. than an anime teaching life lessons.
@norman readdis  well I kind have a little knowleged of whats going on right now. I actually found out somethings a few months ago on my channel. but alot of this revolves around chian and russia right now. I found all this out through some things from a youtube video Imade months ago  and a person from melonies  discord  we explained some of it to me also. but its pretty much war.
@nosaj ttimmed  I advice you to read the naked communist to better introduce you to why  who and what is happening.
@norman readdis  I will for sure. it will give me a better perspective of things.
@nosaj ttimmed  good.
alternatively  the farseer series is excellent.
I just realized there was no outro music. but still very much enjoyed the video melonie.
a lot of the live action anime that comes from japan is pretty decent. like rorounI kenshin  goemon  and the two death note movies that came out before the disaster netflix adaptation. its hit or miss  I haven t enjoyed any of the americanized versions. maybe except ghost in the shell  but thats skirting it.
why
its money scam.
thats just a pr strategy sure oda is involved but with manga and movie I dont suppose he had infinite time
at least the one piece live action looks like they re putting some effort into it
it would not surprise me in the slightest if there was an actual line in vegas giving odds on what ip from the world of videogames   anime will netflix destroy next.
I dont think her voice can be sweetly beautiful than allready is!
they cantry and they will fail. I dont particularly understand why they insist on trying to adapt these because unless its a series  or series of movies  there isn t any way to adapt them. the only two properties Ive ever seen brought to live action well are alita  battle angel and the rurounI kenshin.
netflix makes their own adaptation of melonie mac go boom starring dylan mulvaney as mel
she is so close to realizing the problem in the all the media she keeps promoting through her critical criticisms of it.  imagine if she stopped watching  and promoting through her  reporting   the garbage and turned her attention to something productive.
Im predicting thatsince it takes place in an academy. it will be like the superhero version of fate  the winx saga.
because this worked so well with cowboy bebop.
bakudeku dekogo is probably going to be canon in their rendition and rocklock might become one of the most important characters in the entire series.
every day the media made to entertain us strays further from us.
kill bill is an holywood film that is based on hongkong cinema that respects the subject and is well liked  it can be done its just the people who work on the projects. lady snowblood is worth a watch. holywood just dont get it. also the matrix is also ghost in the shell and hk cinema  when hk got handed over a lot of the film makers fled to holywood and ended up working on the matrix fights. also black swan and perfect blue.
I have high expectations because other anime live action adaptations have japanese actors
death note  you cant __ your way to happiness.
honestly  what baffles me about these adaptations is the fact that a lot of these animes take place in a whole world  not a bubble. mha is a great example. you can absolutely do a live action my hero  but spotlight the american hero agency with only light references or cameos of the japanese characters. the whole world got superpowers. we ve gotten an in depth look at how japan handles that  how did the usa handle the arrival of quirks  does their hero system function slightly different than the one set up in japan  is there a global system set up that dictates these things  who are the big heroes in america  who are the big villains  literally you could make a whole series of films on this and barely touch on the main series. there s a series of short films that demonstrated this perfectly called ua  la  I believe. seriously. if youre going to race swap and  americanize  this anyways  why not just create new characters wholesale
its only a matter of time until they make that harry partridge akira film
Im a huge mha fan. its my absolute favorite anime airing right now and the only manga I buy and read  atm. I have aizawa hanging from my rearview mirror. I have an all might hoodie as well. with all thatsaid... .... I do not want this. insert michael scott no memeI dont know how it could be translated to live action without losing a lot in that translation. no one is going to outdo chris sabat at voicing portraying all might  as far as english is concerned. ntm  how do you bring the all might to small might to screen !  at times its used for comedy and at others for drama  highly emotional moments   there s no way to live action that.
hahahaha imagine how netflix would portray minetta  you think they d show him looking up momo s skirt every day
well  Im mostly caught up in the manga and watched all the anime too  netflix needs to leave this one alone! they will completely ruin it like they ruin everything!
I dont typically watch anime  but this movie is something I would watch.  its not necessarily a negative to get your fandom in a different format to bring in new fans.  I am infinitely more likely to watch the anime if I like this movie than if it didn t exist.  if the witcher series got people to try out the games or read the books  awesome.
my desire to watch anime in the forest next to a sleeping lion is just a weeb away a weeb away a weeb away.
at least noamI is going to be a redhead.

netflix reeeally didn t do that with the witcher though... if anything  itscared people off from it.this will be no different.
@hausbrauen  at this point  if they hadn t played the games  they wouldn t know they exist aside from the series.  if you aren t aware of their existence  youre not buying them either.
@namelessminion veinreaver that may be true for you  but that isn t the case for many people.  years ago I heard about the witcher netflix series  started it  hated it  didn t think about it for a year and it made me not want to play the games.  then a close friend very recently recommended trying the games  6-7 years after witcher 3 has been out  which Ive been well aware of prior .  I started playing through the trilogy  currently on the 3rd game already  and I love the series now.  I can also see what netflix did to the witcher was only about 20  faithful to the source material  you could tell the writers producers of the show dont even care for the source material.regardless  my only regret with the witcher was watching the netflix series.  I realize thats not going to be everyone else s experience of course  just thought I d share mine.
they did a good job on castlevania. whoever they put in charge of that adaptation isn t getting enough projects from them. so help me  netflix better not f    up all might!
dang it netflix
I couldn t even get into my hero I tried 6 times and every time bakugo spoke I wanted someone to punch him in the throat I highly doubt they have the budget needed for all the special effects of quirks
they need to do akira.the rock as the colonel  hiro sanada as the doctor  and a bunch of j and k pop stars to fill out the cast.make it americanized.. buuuut! get the arcane guys to do the art.
idk I d be against it but from the sounds of it I actually might give it a chance n see where they go instead of judging it before its even out but I ll always stick wit the anime and manga no doubt bout it
death note is brilliantly written.
11 12 get ready for blakugo
the thing with manga and anime there s still an ambiguous element to the characters I forget what race they are where live action youreally notice it there just different mediums kinda like movies and games
just w8 till they tell the bakugo how they plan to make the last few arcs....
I know they better not ruin ghost in the shell
all I can say is that they did not learn their lesson from the previous anime adaptations such as most recently their live action cowboy bebop.
woke religion  by wes carpenter would be a good resource for your segment tomorrow.
amazon needs to start developing live action anime instead of netflix
netflix already animated like 3-4 fantasy series and somehow made them look identical and lose their identity....
mha could work well for a live action and nothing stopping netflix at this point they even are making a one piece live action which is almost impossible to do..
I cant wait to see a netflix live action metalocalypse. go from an over the top show about a metal band  to gore horror show about something dumb.
I watch anime because well.. its anime. I dont get my anime fix by watching a live adaptation of it..if I want to see live action anime  I ll go to a comic-con.
watch them make deku and bakugo have a hidden romantic relationship  which will be the reason why bakugo is always angry whenever girls try to flirt with deku!
damn you netflix!!
death note 2017 be like. if anyone wants to see a good live action  mha has a stage play and Ive heard thats its good
my hero  if it has to be live action should be the start origin of ofa and afo
there going to make yuga aoyama the star
if put in the right hands it could probably be good cause in my opinion mha feels already pretty american for me even if it is and from japan
american studios need to stop relying on existing properties to make their films. I say  their films  very specifically since it will not be an accurate reflection of the source material  it will be their own product with the source as a cover.
the only thing worse than a live action anime adaptation is a netflix live action anime adaptation.
shit  here we go again.
I dont think anyone was surprised that this was going to be terrible  thankfully it wont detract from the manga and anime
did horikoshI even approve it
well this adaptation wont at all end up being just like dragonball evolution  death note  cowboy bebop  or ghost in the shell. and we still get to  look forward  one piece and yu yu hakusho in the future. and there exists the possibility of a hunter x hunter netflix treatment  sorry melonie  I cantotally see that happening and being very disappointed in the eventual news
very low expectations for this  and as much as the director for the one piece live action come off as a pretty cool and likeable person  I still have very low expectations.because netflix and western media in general
I guess their plan is to throw shit at the wall until something sticks lol.
cant wait for bakugal and dekutta to fight all white. to prove there love for each other is the only way.
you are really naturally funny and you dont even try to be.
if hollywood is really all about diversity why do they  white wash  these asian japanese shows with western actors and western concepts. the whole reason anime is popular is due to the fact  it is steeped in japanese culture and are understood the characters  despite how some characters look  to be japanese asians unless the show says otherwise.
true  let mha be it is a amazing anime!!
your hair is adorable. but why the heck do you and anyone else still have wokeflix after cuties      side note you should have a shirt thatsays  I woke better than you.
mha is already on the downhill in the plot department for a while now . this seem like a next logical step of development
their one piece live thing isn t even out and they re already on hero academia   lol
Im sure it will be almost as good as death note.
@norman readdisspeaking of celebrities  celebrity voice acting in video games sucks like its really really bad
@norman readdispersonally I think video games becoming more and more cinematic was probably the biggest mistake of the 7th and 8th generation of gaming.
@norman readdisvideo games have been moving away for the longest time from being video games to being more like cinematic interactive movies.
@naquin green there s nothing wrong with being cinematic as long as it balances it out and cinematic narrative games is its own category like uncharted etc. there s games thats balances it out like some japanese and western games like witcher for the west and xenoblade chronicles for japan. but japanese are always too graphic novely most of the times. so a cinematic direction in place of text boxes youread for hoirs is a better choice imho.
@norman readdis  what about bad celebrity voice acting in video games  most of the time we will get good celebrity voice acting in games like the early to mid 2000s ps2 xbox generation but recently since the release of the ps5   xbox series x s celebrity voice acting has become more and more frequent and not all of it is good in fact some of it is downright cringe-worthy.
@naquin green I dont mind the va quite honestly as long as they make a good game with tons of content because we came all the from re1 and those 90s campy va.
@norman readdis  ronda rousey in mk 11 is a very very bad example.
@naquin green honestly dont mind her tho. she s still way better than chris pratt mario.
@norman readdis  no by much imo. out of all the talented professional voice actors they could have hired or re-hired  including her previous voice actor from mkx  they instead hired one of the blandest actors in hollywood. it was nothing more than a publicity stunt from warner bros and netherrealm studios that ended in failure as nobody liked her performance.
@norman readdis  not all celebrities make for good voice actors Imean just look at scoob  2020  as an example of poor voice acting ruining what was an otherwise mediocre subpar movie.
@naquin green thats a movie which va is important. if you grew up in the 80s 90s gaming industry where the va is subpar and meme worthy this is nothing.
netflix original anime is surprisingly fine. I dont know why they keep thinking the live-action reboots are a good idea. is there a single example where this has gone well for any company  ever since arrested development season 3 I think they have a troll department or something just to build controversy  and now anime keeps being the sacrificial lamb.
did they not learn from cowboy bebop or whatever the heck one piece is gonna end up being !
I find your rant hilarious when holly weird is working on a gundam movie.
with netflix s track record of butchering anime franchises I would bet money they ll do it again and blame the fans. they just need to stop or go out of business period.
the only person I trust to do an anime live action show or movie is peter jackson. and idk if he even likes anime lol I doubt it
I feel these japanese animation companies allow netflix to do this for a quick easy buck and to remind the fans that anime will always be superior to all american adaptations.
what was that tweet about sky high  I liked that movie.
when I head that legendary is making a live action my hero academia movie I automatically assumed that they would release it in theaters but after hearing that its going to be released on netflix Im a little disappointed because I want see this on the big screen it could sell a lot of money for the box office
netflix ruin a anime on adaptation   pretends to be shocked
after analyzing and comparing to other properties  I think when netflix or any western company tries to adapt anime  their approach is already completely off. as in  they try to make their own story where the manga anime already has one.comparing to marvel  they can make as many spider-man comic stories to as they want as long as it has the core origin  uncle ben  great power etc. since then  many writes were able to write spider-man stories without sticking to one set timeline or overall story thus making alot of movies. as long as its good  people tend to accept the  version  they see.  you cant really do that with anime manga because there is a linear story in which it has to go through or else you mess up everything. its like if you took harry potter  make him go to the dudleys  meet hagrid and go to hogwarts but then say  oh instead of voldemort  lets do something else.  it becomes an absolute dumpster fire of a movie as it doesnt stay true to the source material since its a fairly linear story. we saw this with dragon ball z where itstarts with goku as a teen with grampa gohan alive and him going to school when actually  we first saw goku as a child and him not even knowing  what a girl was when he met bulma. also with death note  they took the characters light  ryuk and l and went completely off the rails. its even worse when anime is already the  perfect  adaptation of manga. I can already imagine that they ll take mha  have him meet all-might   then do their own thing which alienates the fans who watched read the manga anime.
in these type of cases  the creator has full responsibility in licensing his work for netflix to butchered it alive adapt it  right  I remember reading toho s reaction after seeing the 1998 Godzilla movie  I thought at the time it was so vitriol but now itseems like the most appropriate response to defend something that its yours and not well represented for your standards.
the oversaturation of some animes like my hero  and chainsaw is the next one to be licensed out hope they dont fuck that one up
I can not wait to see the wigs
will they have that kid cry every 8 seconds like in the anime
anime does not need any love action adaptations. very seldom do they ever work out.
legendary has some good past projects but I would have preferred universal or wb to get this ip over netflix
they re gonna screw this up.
Im midway through season 5.  there is no way in the world that you can make this amazing anime a live-action.  also  the one piece live-action is getting hardly any press  so Im betting  hoping  itsucks.I am brought to tears quite often while watching this show.  there s just no way they can do this and it keep the same tone as the anime.  an actor is not going to be able to pull off deku.  how are they going pull off all-might   its going to have to be heavily cgI d  and that will make it awful.  there are things that you can only do in an anime.  Im just frustrated over this so much.
they do realise there s somone calledmineta. lol
they re making uwe boll movies feel like masterpieces compared to this.
I agree with you legendary pictures have proved they can handle a japanese property and do right look at Godzilla
@animezilla 44  I have complete faith that this my hero academia live action movie would be a success but its a missed opportunity to not release it in theaters first then netflix afterwards instead of netflix first then dvd and blu ray afterwards
@cj gamer  except ther is only so much shit u could do adapting a whole ass show as movie Godzilla workd cause it ain t a show to begin with this has lik 10  chance to work
@saro v  they most likely adapting the first season
Im agree with you  Im really really mad.
so you want it to be a shot through shot remake of the anime
@cj gamer  no just stay faithful
@emmanuel molina  oh okay
so youre saying the french live adaptation of city hunter is off even though it has gotten tons of praise from anime fans
I disagree with you on that because legendary pictures is also involved with the project I think this should be deserves a chance
love action   no  we definitely dont need a hentaI adaptation of mha.
there are lots and lots of love action adaptations of anime and they are pretty good
@patrick stewart  the professor has spoken
I think anime s being adapted into live action shouldnt have the main characters as the cast.it would be better for spin offs so people dont say shit like  oh he doesnt even look like deku! rivenx3Imade a short small budget spin off of mha and its probably the best live action ive seen.if he s not on it then I dont wanna see it
they better not touch one punch man.
I loved the death note manga. not sure about the other versions.light was a psychopath from the start. but is was never evil. he is the villain. he did bad things. but the intent was always to make the world a better place for everyone.going about that by killing evil people may be morally wrong. that is open for debate and complicated as hell. and throwing in killing innocent people trying to stop him make it even more complicated.but ya  he was always a psychopath. trying to make the world better through murder. is the punisher a good guy or a bad guy
anime.  doesnt.  work.  live-action.  its anime for a reason!edit   this goes for japan as well  kenshin is one of my favorite animes  and even the japanese cant get it right in live action.
the only thing that matters in Godzilla movies  are the monsters  the locations and actors never mattered.
netflix sure likes beating us over the head with bad live action adaptations. I have 0 faith in this one and Im not paying for it to find out.
im worried for one piece now
great take on light yagami. netflix hasn t got a prayer.
subtitles work fine. even when tig anime bitties are jiggling about  my eyes are focused on the words. I swear.
this is great news. now the rabid my hero fanbase will hunt down   the message  people.
nerds  as you call them like Godzilla for many reasons  monsters  fantasy  japanese culture  and the last one is not what american cinema does not get. we are interested in other cultures but are accused of being racists.
the fine folks at rivenx3I already published a solid my hero academia live action concept video. fandom done right. search for ua la pilot episode 0.
netflix is going to lose even more money.
one piece live action is going to be abysmal
hI new sub but netflix has to stop because my hero academy is my favorite anime Im watching you netflix
the problem is the hate watching. poor reviews and low scores on websites mean absolutely nothing if everyone clicks play on every episode just to hate watching it the entire time. they win the second you click  play.
nothing they do is going to affect the original anime or manga.nothing they do is going to turn out well. I enjoy  however  watching them waste money. shame that the people involved will have their names muddied from this production  though.
melonie  the us always did that.now they are targeting japan but they did the same with many other countries.in the 90s  there were a lot of hollywood movies made out of french ones  true lies for instance
I was already dreading them doing one piece.  my hero isn t as important  but I still cant help but be worried. western media is straight trash.
they re gonna wokeify  and its gonna bomb. crazy prediction  I know.
do we even have to be reminded of the attack on titan movies
even marvel movies dont work if they 1 1 comics which they try to do in anime la in which they stil fail
I disagree with that entirely you seem to forgot that netflix is not the one that got the rights to the series that was legendary pictures by itself
lol I wish
@animezilla 44  yeah  it is. everything in the last ten years was utter garbage.
@the captain  the box office says otherwise and you seem to forgot we had a few movies that came out this year that were amazing like top gun maverick and let s not forget Godzilla versus kong which was a juggernaut at the box office
they ll ruin it  they cant help themselves but we all know they ll ruin it. anytime someone at netflix suggests making a live version of an anime they should be forced to watch the netflix version of  cowboy bebop  on an endless loop. that way they ll either see how stupid it was to even suggest such a thing or they ll go insane  be committed to a mental asylum and we ll never have to hear such a stupid suggestion ever again.
well this is disappointing. I really dont want them to butcher this anime.
please dont live action my shigaraki
my hero academia takes place in japan. Im guessing the netflix show takes place in america and there would be a diverse cast
they are poking at a hornets nets and it wont go very well for them if they ruin anime
dude! you got an idea here about Godzilla! make a japanese version of gojira  after he destroys tokyo for the 90th time he disappears into the water  then boom! release Godzilla in the united states!! he came from tokyo! crossover!! sounds cheesy  but still better than anything woke hollywood is coming up with! what were we talking about
many other anime live adaptations have been ruined in the past and not necessarily by hollywood. ever heard wicked city  patlabor  g gundam
at  this  point part of me has  to  think there ruining  theses  ips  on  purpose. just look at  the cowboy bebop adaptation.
the live action netflix death note is a gem! its a 10 10  modern classic  and a true work of art! all this hate speech against this beloved movie needs to stop because I need the sequel! please  the live action death note is my favorite comedy and I need more!
my soul hurts...
they made me mad before with the death note movie  then again with cowboy bebop  and then went the extra mile with the sandman show  I really didn t like that   so sure  keep kicking my favorite things in the balls  netflix. see how far that gets you.
I will be personally offended if all of them are not japanese or japanese-descendent actors thatspeak fluent japanese. the whole shtick is that its happening in japan with japanese culture inspired by western idea of golden age comic books superhero archetype  and breaking thatstereotype with humane and empathetic representation of both sides... if even one  and Imean one character will be played by non-japanese person  with the exception of the headmaster and eventually characters actually from abroad  then I will boycott the entire thing  start up petitions and try to shut it down before anyone even put s a first step on the set.but honestly  I wish they  hollywood  stopped or tried to use their big budgets to actually get talents from the countries they are extracting stories from and not try to westernize everything by force. I  kind of  understand why they think thats a good idea  they think the average movie-goer that will buy tickets to their movies is a dumb poor xenophobic sheep that has been taught to only like their woke politicized agenda-filled caricatures of the western concepts and disapprove and dislike anything thats against or at least not exactly according to their own self-imposed teachings of irrational self-indulgent narcissism  but at the same time they are aware these things they import from other countries and other cultures and other media have fans and traction around enough to put their own time  money and other resources in.they ruined books  games  comics  now all of japan - simply because they are living in the bubble of  they wont buy non-hollywood stuff from hollywood  we need it hollywood style for sure  because in the past those projects were not as fruitful as some producers expected and they are stuck in that mindset for 50 years instead of seeing how availability of those other cultures expanded the audiences and doesnt need to be hollywood-ified. quite the contrary - the more ip they get their hands on  Imean netflix  disney  warner  you name it   subsequently and consequently ruin for the existing fans and are only footnotes for the  new fans   i.e. one time viewers that only ever see this one thing that is the same as all the other things  they are actually turning more and more people away from them.everyone is a fan of something. if they ruin enough of the things they will eventually get to the point where the studio will go bankrupt because no one will be willing to trust them to make good enough product for a single person to pay for a ticket or a copy... money s rolling now  sure  but on the long run if you analyze the trends - the industry of semi-monopolized big studios   platforms is dying out. they just refuse to see that and correct their course.
I have same office chair as you and im sad cuz the plastic rubber foam coverings for the arms are wearing away
re  ethnic casting   they should literally all be japanese.  ua is in japan  and japans is exceptionally ethnically homogenous.
I think this is a ploy to stop the popularity of anime in the west.
they do a great job with animated video game adaptations.  however  they are complete ass when it comes to live action stuff.  there are just somethings that dont ever need to be done in live action.
they literally would make half or less money if they made a Godzilla movie in japan with japanese actors. americans and alot of other countries would rather see an american based Godzilla.
I know they are doing of avatar  the last air bender live action
Imean I think the mha manga and anime both fell off hard and I still dont want to see netflix do this and ruin the good parts
they did its called the woman king.
nope most likely japan
@cj gamer  u ever seen their adaptation of cowboy bebop or death note
@45 jacky  Ive seen clips of it
I wish netflix would figure out they suck at live action anime and give it a rest.and never never apologize for bringing up Godzilla! he is the king of monsters Ive seen every movie since I was like 5 years old
not the most focused of discussion analysis videos. then again  youre quite infamous for going into long rants  which is what they are  but your points are made crystal clear.  d haha ...best to keep the focus of your videos on the topics at hand  especially since they re in the titles of said-videos.
I agree I think america is just 99  political and some japanese stuff is getting censored and that like ff7 tifa apparently boobs are a problem in one of the most  free  times for woman to be  proud  of their body and show it off. kinda ridiculous imo
ah yes  live action  the black sheep of a franchise. the ones that dont get invited to family reunions.
lol let s wait and see what they do to gravity girl lol
here s the thing  or at least  this was my experience with the woke movement. itstarted off great. fighting against gay and trans hate and discrimination. pointing out that there aren t as many female protagonists than male  which is true  but  as was understood by the people I talked to  it was something that was getting better to the point where it was almost a nonissue. pointing out thatsexual preference was heavily skewed towards straight in almost every romance  which  again  is true  but also understanding that the vast majority of of people are straight  so that made sense. they were asking for more diverse content and  most importantly  was creating the content they wanted to see. they never asked for characters to be bent to their wants  only that creators think on including more options for character traits in the future.at least  at first.then  it devolved into using gay or homosexual instead of good or well or quality. then  if art wasn t depicting a gay couple or a trans character  it would be overlooked or forgotten. as a white  straight male in that environment  I was never insulted or attacked  but it was exceedingly difficult to talk with these people  as any dialogue was followed up with  thats so gay!  or  thats homophobic.  without the context being those subjects. it had just become the lexicon  and when dialogue gets that brainless  communication cant happen smoothly.its ridiculous. and companies keep feeding this kind of divide. because nothing buys more free press than evangelicals and fanatical wokeism is the new religion.
hasn t mha already been ruined enough by bones  incompetence  cant they ruin other popular anime like jujutsu kaisen or demon slayer  hell those anime at least features normal human as characters  so netflix can already save themselves a lot of trouble from uncanny valley while adapting the designs of mha character to live action
the shounen boys are going to get nerfed so hard in this movie
I honestly dont think anime should ever be made live action. I understand broadening an audience but that is why dubs were made in the first place... unlike with games that take some form of skill or having to buy   read the original material  manga or light novels  if the only excuse is  I cant watch cartoons  you dont deserve the content at all.
at least they wont make a tokyo ghoul netflix live action movie or chainsaw man movie..hahaha I really hope that they dont
in all fairness netflix cant ruin a anime by making a live action version.  the anime is still there  manga too probably  and you can just ignore the shitty live action garbage.  thats what I did with cowboy bebop.
netflix doing live action anime is pointless. hollywood doing live action versions of animated stuff in general is usually a 50 50 situation. more often than not tho it leads to really  really bad results. this shit works better in animation. netflix just dont touch it. literally you do a better job just having the anime on your platform rather than trying to adapt it yourself.
call me a heretic but I 99.9  of the time watch dubbed
netflix originals are the the asylum of the streaming world. pure bait-and-switch.
having learned nothing from the cowboy bebop fiasco netflix proceeds to crap all over another franchise.
even though its not animated anime  I still look forward to seeing a live action version on my  1 favorite anime.
I wonder if melonie has seen shin Godzilla directed by hidekI anno of evangelion  fame  ..... the american  monsterverse  movies are garbage oversaturated with humanssss.. though the human-scenes in shin Godzilla are heavy they do base the crazy Godzilla firmly in the japanese real world... especially the ending!I dont trust legendary anymore. the potential for my hero is immense as is the potential for failure absolute.
netflix again
can netflix  just drop anime in general please  they ve tried but either the anime is censored to the ground or its been turned into a live-action abomination
they re also doing a one piece adaptation.
but netflix is not the one working on my hero academia thats legendary pictures
the only manga anime movie adaptation that was good was alita  battle angel
wes from thinking critical turned me onto my hero academia. great show!
of course they do they keep ruining shit.  they re not getting any of my money.
I dont think that american adaptations of japanese properties is outside of the realm of possibility  I actually like the live action ghost in the shell  make fun if you want  but when a company with a track record like netflix s  wants to take part in this... its an absolute no-go. netflix really needs to buckle down on the already great sources of animation that they can pull from  why not partner with dc for more awesome animated movies or shows like we used to get in the 2000 s and 2010 s. with the exception of a few movies  animated dc is better to watch that live action dc. better yet  netflix could focus on in-house properties like castlevania  or give a well liked book series with rich visuals and extensive story that really lends itself to the medium the treatment it deserves. the dresden files comes to mind.
netflix needs to leave anime alone
this should be illegal for netflix to dotheory deku will be black lesbian and gayalso it will fail like cowboy beepbopthey dont have the rights to use it and it cant cancell mha anyway. you cant use an anime in a live action and ruin it.
hate to tell you while sub are popular with nerd culture  but the average casual person who would be watching the movies on the big screen  would reject subs overall.  the last few big budget king  kong and Godzilla movies were made for the casual movie goers not nerds.  hopefully  my hero academia is done with the japanese culture in mind since it made for the more otaku type person in the usa and in europe.
hello  mel  unrelated to topic  lol   but I wa buying a bunch of g-fuel using your code and it dawn on me that you were in a contest and I was wondering did you win or place
if you anticipate them changing all might into a lesbian woman of color  then whatever else they change becomes relatively moot.
they re probably going to cast lizzo as all might...
japanese culture needs to be adapted for american audiences because japanese culture is incompatible with british culture... the culture of america.Im probably the only person in western society who realizes that japan eventually won wwii.
you people seem quick to talk shit about netflix in times like these  but where s the criticism towards horikoshI  its not like he didn t have a say in the matter... unlike western comics  the author owns the rights and cantotally turn down a live action offer regardless of what the publisher wants.if this actually gets made and it turns out to be shit  this is on netflix just as much as its on horikoshi. y all just dont like the fact that your favorite author likes money more than he cares about the integrity of his creation.
like they didn t show what they can do with adaptations  let me remind you cowboy  witcher  resident evil... soon this list will be joined by avatar and mha  oh well  I guess I ll have more money to spend on something else.
nobody wants or needs live action anime adaptations. they literally always suck. anime is anime for a reason. the medium works.
netflix to ruin should replace netflix to adapt
why must they insist on ruining great japanese ip s  thatsaid though I actually enjoyed the cowboy bebop live action. it was fun to watch  seemed like the actors were enjoying themselves for the most part. Im not holding out hope for mha though  I guarantee you it will be trash.
well  melonie  Im very anti-woke  but Im also antI religion.  I was what I would definitely call brainwashed  as a child  into Christianity.  I dont see the difference between brainwashing your kids into wokism and religion.  like you said  wokeness is a cult.  to me  they are both the same.  fortunately for me  I have a mind of my own.  I had zero intentional outside influence when I came to this realization at 23 years old.  Im now 45.  I do understand the need to latch on to religion.  it makes sense to me  especially since I grew up in it  but no matter the religion  its a tool to control the masses.  some are more destructive than others  unfortunately.  I have no issues with Christians  but muslims would un-alive me for my existence  so my view on them is less than favorable.  I actually think your dedication to your faith is adorable.
macademia  not the nut.
hey melonie mac can you talking about power rangers since it also appear on netflix
hey.... I was expecting the song at the end
I love that movie
ther are better anime too check out like gintama or one piece
culturulu brasphemy. ne plus orca!  -- lizzo as all meat
yeah and they re probably getting tom holland to play izuku
I went through this phase before too and God took me back  I hope your heart is softened and you can come back to the Lord as well. satan has you exactly where he wants you right now  and by thinking you are serving nobody  you are serving him
@melonie mac go boom amen
@melonie mac go boom  I am serving my family  loved ones  fellow americans  and country all together. the way I came to my conclusion was most likely different than you did once. my brother constantly eggs me to come back to it  but I fear thats impossible. Ive seen what Ive seen and its impossible to unsee it.I do appreciate your concern though. Christians are certainly one of the kinder groups  or are most of the time at least.
watch ua la. an adaptation spinoff of mha done right
they ve learned nothing from death note and cowboy bebop
its funny that they kept dave chappelle and I still have zero respect for them lol
whenever you hear netflix anime live action you can already tell its gonna suck. plus they got the person who directed obI wan kenobI yeah no faith
netflix  we made it  but better.anime fans   japan  on what demented world you think turning animation into live action counts as better netflix  misogyny   homophobiaanime fans   japan  ah shit  here we go again.
if you want good live action anime check out re anime he got really good fan made videos
if they ruin arcane  .
so who s gay   let s make a bet we got   im - bk               aizawa - mike              kyoka - momo
hey! netflix! leave them anime alone!
they will change stuff  insult fans and somehow make things worse like they always do.
being an anime fan we are used to horrible live action but netflix is especially poop at it
what will they ruin next
prediction  momo wont have the outfit from the anime  uraraka will suddenly be a strong woman of color  the mind guy is gonna be in a wheelchair like doctor x and deku is gonna be gay for bakugo.
ya netflix pisses me off they got kengan asura a baf fighting anime n bsing it
do one about one piece!!!!!!!!
mineta is going to get the ban hammer
hey melonie.
hold on here. really asking for a friend.. I dont get it. what is the difference between a sub and a dub anime
death note  cowboy bebop  one piece  and now mha. just stahhhhhhhp!
netflix needs to buzz off and leave good animes alone!
netflix doesnt insult fans
@cj gamer  they dont care enough to insult yea
@saro v  I know right
subs are japanese voices with english subtitles  and dub is english voices
where is the end card!
gonna pretend I didn t hear that
they ll kill all might in the first episode and claim deku s real power is toxic masculinity. urara will be the main focus.
noooooo
my hero has a lot of characters who would look pretty stupid in live-action.
I wouldn t be shocked if netflix aka trashflix
you need to just nor watch. worked for cowboy bebop
their gonna make it into cw grade drama between teens it will have nothing to do with the main plot what makes a hero a genuine hero
are these monsters going to make deku-baku cannon
they already destroyed death note  cowbow bebop  one piss  and now this  whats next  jojo
well a lot of my hero is american influenced. delaware and detroitsmash!!!
they re also going to ruin yuyu hakusho  rurounI kenshin movies are good because they weren t woked.
code geass   death note
so close to 100k before the new years
awesome
funny if they race swap wall of them
ok how do you say right here and right now this is not gonna be good my hero is just one of those things that just doesnt work well in live action
this doesnt sound too good from netflix as they didn t learn anything after death note bomb and fans wanted cowboy bebop to be cancelled.
hey! teachers leachers! leave those kids anime alone!
the west needs to leave anime alone. how much money will they have to lose to get the memo
I forgot it this time  my brain wasn t working today
@melonie mac go boom  it happens from time to time
that anime of thumbnail doesnt have a jaw wtf
netflix ruins everything.
boycott netflix  let show what happens now if you mess with a big anime like this. also does the original creator have the power to stop this
live action bleach  ugh!
how about netflix stop touching any preexisting shows movies
net flix  disney is trying to get its grubby hands on dr. who now. I didn t care for the writing done on the last dr. incarnation. but disney has no clue about this show. it will most likely be the next casualty of a once great franchise.
in before black deku and trans ochaco.
as a fan of my hero academia Im pissed
netflix really is a disgusting place
next on netflix  naruto and boruto live action!!! filled with 10 years of fillers.
as with most animes the charactersare japanese not white
the bleach live action movie wasn t terrible but my hero should never be made into live action.   the hero villain costumes and character design  wouldn t work.
netflix board   ok  now that we are going to do  my hero academia ....who can we race   gender swap   lets make yuga aoyama   ochaco uraraka a lesbian couple......
hey melonie missing cool dogs  yes netflix and anime live action are mmmmmmmmm only rurounI kenshin is decent  but the most live action suck is hard to become anime in real life person.
noooooooooooooooooooo dont ruin the replacement for dc comics bet there gonna make deku and bakugo into a couple and total gloss over the toxic realtionship they had over most of there lives because  omg hot teen guys kissing
I gotta ignore this for my sanity lol I still have the henry cavil netflix stuff fresh in my mind  he loved the source material and the writers didn t. they sucked the soul out of the witcher and they suck the soul out of anime lmao
whered ur sick outro go
how can we make netflix mad  shit on them for making something that never needed to exist called  cuties
yup  you cant do live action anime unless your studio has a fat budget or else stick to realistic anime  no super powers  etc.
I cant wait till netflix s woke live action my hero academia fails I will enjoy this dumpster fire
I disagree with that
they re gonna ruin yu yu hakusho next.
leave all might alone!
they already ruined it by dubbing it.  cant get much worse.
oml go away netflix   my guess is they want to anger nerds enough to where they lash back at them then the journos case of we re bad is justified
insert the ofice gif  no Godpls no God please nonoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
noooooooooo
I see a bear back there
dont forget about the shit that was bleach
watch  theyre gonna cut out ochaco and just make deku and bakugo gay for the  modern audience  lol
watch them make midoriya gay. . .
melonie  dont worry  nobody going to watch this live action film... let them fail again and again and again... someday they will react... I hope so...
netflix anime  gender swap  race swap  add feminist and racial politics  ignore original anime and manga  attack fans.
japanese anime film adaptations look bad  but netflix s anime film adaptations look even worse.
another live action netflix movie... I am guessing the male characters all die in the first act and over-powered female characters that dont exist in the anime take over the whole movie because this is for the modern western audience  even though no one asked for it .
they will make deku and bakugo gay for sure in the live adapt
they are going to ruin my fav shonen one piece
netflix needs to stop  they ve seen how much of a failure anime in live action is  God they re still working on one piece now they wanna touch bnha
anime has always been midand they re gonna make it worse lol
4 times now
sorry for the meme but ... first time
my hero would be awful live action
there will be no exposed skin.
mannnnnn
also seeing my hero academia in fortnite is disappointing as well.
my hero is jubI gami
shin g jira   monsterverse
just leave anime alone netflix
all might will be black   of course he will  right
netflix is doing these terrible adaptations as a demoralizing tactic under order of the wef  they dont care about money anymore.
pleaseeeeee  dont.
the live-action scene is where all anime go to die.death note  attack on titan  jjba  bleach  cowboy bebop. like c mon man!plus  I love mha  so I am fucking hoping this doesnt get through. deku and the others do not deserve to get altered by wokeflix over here.
I am a weeb
netflix  just stop.
as long as they stay the hell away from one piece!
marry meeeeeeee!!!!!!
my little sister likes thatshow.
cant wait for michael bay to get his hands on mobile suit gundam...
sigh
aren t you a little old for anime
Im still praying they cancel doing gears of war
netflix is not the one doing the adaptation thats legendary pictures they got the rights to the series back in 2018
@animezilla 44  netflix  legendary pictures and all major western companies takes orders from the same people and follow the same plan
this is how the woke works  if it doesnt promote the message  it needs to be changed.
netflix making another shitty adaptation. in other news the sky is still blue waiting to see what she thinks about the new tomb raider disney plus tv show.
netflix ruins all anime  death note bleach  cowboy
live action of anime and mang  is very stupid  because even when well done is not good  is not something that translate well to live action!
live action mha   netflix live action adaptation mha   why  netflix has produced nothing but garbage when it comes to there adaptation they need to leave anime and video games the hell alone
dude of all people  why joby harold  he completely ruined the kenobI show.
cant wait for the woke fad to be over.
oh no  not with the woke garbage going on right now  unless they promise to follow it to the t and not some adaptation
they about to ruin one of my favorite animes   they ruined cowboy bebop  now this  f netflix
weeb nation rise up
first bleach  now my hero ! ! this is ridiculous
how can you ruin trash
wait a minute what all do respect I disagree with you entirely especially when it comes to Godzilla as a long time fan of the monster legendary pictures did an amazing job with Godzilla it doesnt need japan to be successful the box office proves otherwise and also you dont need to have the entire cast be japanese people now I agree with you that the stories for from the monsterverse are not that good but think about it people are interested in the monsters not the humans. legendary pictures prove that they dont really care about agenda they just care about making fun movies and thats what they ve been doing with a japanese icon like Godzilla so I am happy for that company getting the rights of my hero academia I truly have faith in thatstudio while everybody just giving up on america and hollywood in general I sure or not legendary pictures is still a good studio and deserve this chance to make an anime   manga title
lets see how many get race or gender swapped ..
live action adaptations suck. netflix adaptations suck. these people really need to find a new nich to stay relevant.
no. no. just leave anime alone  hollywood. you dont know how to adapt it properly.
why even make this  its already a syndicated television show. mha doesnt need to be live action. no anime needs a live action version. I cantake or leave death note to be honest. I watched  both seasons and the finale broke me. just the way it all ended made me feel stupid for even giving it a chance.
death note was a decent adaptation cowboy bebop was great actually weebs just couldn t hack whole cast wasn t japanese...that was the main boycott... costume wise and styling those two films was good...but the japanese helmed adaptation looks like cosplay grade costumes equipped with cheap wigs...
as if the annoying gay shipping fans weren t bad enough.
should I rage quit being a weeb because of stupid live-actions
I think youre a little confused here netflix is not the one making the live adaptation legendary pictures is
you could cancel your wokeflix subscription
@bowsette  Im not even subscribed to netflix.
vote with your wallet and do not subscribe  a few very brave critics can watch the woke and report on the continuing decline
ha ha Im the first to watch the video
live action invites normies  and ruins everything! keep it in the comics or animate! live action eventually ruin everything!!
alice in borderland is good. everything is trash.
legendary messed up wow movie so this will be bad too probably like how do you even adapt it without looking corny
cant wait to see bakugo get brow beat into submission by transgendet all might for his toxic masculinity
this is so trash I just caught up with the manga
please nooooo!!!! you already ruined cowboy bebop!  why waste more     just to destroy another franchise and get no viewers   youre losing money for no reason! lmao
apology for saying peach isn t woke when she clearly is. take down your video for lying.
cant wait for izuku to be a girl and bakugo to be a gay black guy...and all might will be a trans woman.gotta crowbar in that diversity.
resident evil remake 2 also ruined  because they used real life actor   and actors   to scan his face to play leon.
netflix needs to disappear as a company
noooo bakugo will be transgender
anime is horrible all around and it deserves to be destroyed at every turn.
let s be honest  most live actions suck.  cowboy bebop for me was one of the better ones and I say that after my first statement set the bar.  but yeah most of these new adaptations are going to suck even more.
you got a japanese director on it
...what
no it doesnt
