I have zero problem with this shooting.  people who think its  unfair  to use a gun to stop someone with a melee weapon are ignorant.1  who said we need to give criminals a fair fight    I want the good guys to have as many advantages as possible.  if you dont want to get shot dont attack people.2  mele weapons are far more dangerous then a gun in mid to close distance.  the time it takes to react to an attack  reach for your weapon  remove it and aim the weapon takes much longer than the few steps to stab someone.   you may think this isn t true but its been proven.   even mythbusters tested this in a knife vs gun test.  from 16 feet or closer knife  melee weapon  wins.as more and more states change to allow constitutional carry   legal right to carry a gun without needing a permit  the chance of the potential victim being armed is going way up.I believe now its 25 states allow this in the usa.  Im in florida which doesnt have it yet but thankfully the wonderful gov. desantis is talking about making that happen!!!  Ive never been more happy to be a floridian than the past 2 years.   dan armed society is a polite society.
I remember seeing an episode of  1000 ways to die  of a dude that just got out of prison and tried to rob a gun store in missouri. it ended like you think it would.
you ve got to love the  play stupid games  win stupid prizes  stories
thats terrible. I hope everyone taking the class is safe and well.the other guy  he fail mr darwin s test.
this day has been filled with great news! if they didn t make that decision  he would have caused more violence. it goes back to the only way to stop violent criminals are law abiding citizens with firearms. reminds me of the story a few days ago about the women who defended her 3 kids from a burglar. we need more law abiding gun owners!
based on what I  learned in my concealed carry class  this situation was textbook. he was committing a forcible felony  and that lawfully permits the use of lethal force. prayers for a full recovery of the officer.
train cops in martial arts  thats like saying  shoot the leg . not how real life works. this guy got the darwin award he deserved.
self defense is self defense. people attacking the officers or defending the criminal are moronic.Im british and I constantly say that an armed society is a polite society.also  as someone that was trained in martial arts I cantell you that one of the key things youre taught is to avoid the fight as much as possible especially if the person is armed.
as a general rule.  lethal force is justifiable when there is the otherwise unavoidable danger of death or grave bodily harm to the innocent  seeing as like 5 civilians were using deadly force to protect the officer and the 1 officer with a duty to protect itseems pretty clear cut to me maybe the dude shouldnt have 1  tried to steal a firearm and 2  not tried to forever sleep an officer
they should have just used martial arts! - person who s never been in a real fight
so what s the law you can shoot someone even if they re fleeing  yes.
mr. peyton wins a darwin award  posthumously.  we must thank him for removing his dna from the gene pool. first  he tried to rob a concealed carry class at a gun range. he then attacks police officers with a deadly weapon  and he becomes an example to the class of what to do when confronted by an attacker.
Im on the cops sides cause he used a screwdriver and this was attempted murder. some cops actually do their job and I ll never hate on that
of course youre a brit  that really got me hahahaha
could have been worse  he could have tried robbing a concealed carry class here in texas.
part of the issue for me was  when I was  seriously  trying to write my trilogy  it was at the start of the woke infiltration. for you have to remember  by the time a trend becomes mainstream  its already past its prime  and something else is in the verge of cutting edge. between 2010 -2012  lqbt was starting to build a community in college campuses and it was around the time I was hearing in a local writer s critique group that I was hearing stuff about the need for more diverse characters in stories. now that its kind of the mainstream push  it may start to be in its waning period. it might take a while to get cringe woke out of books and movies  but the pendulum is starting to sway.
I relate so hard to the introvert lifestyle
wow! this video is spot on  mel. not to simp  but I would seriously give a lung to meet you on a live stream or game. Im a traditional catholic in his 30s and will openly admit our knowledge of scripture isn t always the best  so thanks for your daily readings at the end of the videos!
even with martial arts  most people train with compliant partners and never have to actually fight.  at which time yourealize your attacker isn t compliant and all the cool moves dont work as well.  it gives an advantage  it doesnt give you the ability to dominate  unless its just one more advantage stacked upon other advantages.
also gary and jeremy are crazy if they haven t approached you to join one of their many panel discussions as a regular. you were great on fnt
@mikepette  1  I said I have zero problem with the shooting.  its possible the law may have issues but as this video is narrated by a police officer to the press itsure seems like there the police have no issue with the citizens shooting the attacker.2  saying the attacker was  running away  is really deceptive of you.  look at the attackers position in the video   they are standing in the disabled parking space when it happens.during the attack the guy and the police are all moving away from the camera as a group while he attacks the cop.  they get about 70  of the way through the parking space when the cop collapses and he starts to turn around.the attacker only takes one step and his foot is next to the parking curb when he s shot.  he doesnt even fully turn away from the shooters and only manages to step move one leg away from the shooters and you call that running away the way you say it makes itsound like the guy had been running for 15 feet or more when thats not true.3  there was very little time between the attack on the cop and the shooting.  itsounds as if you may have only watched the slow motion video which makes all actions in the screen appear to take longer than they did in real life.   Im sure you are aware that real life does not happen in slow motion.watch the part at regular speed it appears there is less than one second of time between his last attack on the cop and when he is shot.4  finally you need to consider the time it takes for you to see an action  decide to draw your weapon  move your hand  secure a proper hold on your weapon  draw it from the holster  aim the weapon  consider the surrounding area  such as what s behind the target you are preparing to shoot  and then finally deciding you need to shoot your gun.yes  many of these things happen at the same time.  such as moving your hand to get the gun  deciding if you need to shoot and checking what s behind your target.  but just moving your hand  getting a grip and moving your gun take time.   all of this needs to happen in a very short period of time.  even if you factor in this happening from the start of the attack on the police officer its maybe 2 seconds    again  its not like they waited 10-15 seconds of watching the guy run away before they shot.   it happened extremely fast.its a shame that this guy is dead but he did break the law  resist arrest and violently attack a cop with a deadly weapon.   his death is due to his own actions.
@mr_ batsu  sadly  there are always going to be people who are more sympathetic to criminals than those whose job is to protect others.
@no one of consequence  yup.  until some scumbag attacks them.
nailed it. unfortunately  I live in hawaiI currently  which is a blue hole and ass backwards concerning the 2nd. even so  that hasn t stopped me from encouraging and teaching the women  hell  the people in general  in my life to carry and train. over here  we are being forced to draw a line in the sand and take these things into our own hands. crime rates in hawaiI keep skyrocketing  yet the government refuses to allow citizens to protect ourselves. we even have a duty to retreat in this state  and seriously  fuck. that. shit. nobody  absolutely nobody  is going to come into my home  threaten my family  and get me to turn and run while they re in danger. yet  its been argued like that in this state. its insane. there is a big change coming though... 25 states support constitutional carry. we almost have enough for a convention of states. when that happens  maybe some order will be restored.
an armed society is a polite society. I love that  gonna start using it cause damn is it true.
@dragonborncastle  I wish I could take credit for it but its not mine originally.   d   its from robert a. heinlein    an armed society is a polite society. manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life.
@mr_ batsu  well its the first time Ive heard it  so thank you for quoting it
@mr_batsu the biggest red flag here was his hand in his pocket. the cop was armored  had a weapon  and had backup and he was laid flat by a screwdriver. it just goes to show how you can have every advantage and still lose.
yup  that is where I live. it is extremely easy and hassle free to get a firearm here as itshould be. basically everyone is armed here. an armed society is a polite society. unless you want to cause problems then your example is the outcome. forget about st. louis and kansas city though. we dont claim those areas and they are ran by democrats so you get the idea.
@eyes of ascension  haha  I was gonna say  what about kc and stl  until I expanded your comment and saw that part.  spfld and columbia are getting more and more like kc and stl all the time unfortunately.  I used to love springfield back in the day but its definitely declining.  I live in a small mo town now and I like how many people carry around here  crime rate is nice and low and most people are really polite.  Imoved here from a much larger town and it was definitely a culture shock at first  but I dig it now.  we never even had a lockdown or mask mandate all thru covid  hell the movie theater only closed a couple months.  lots of bonuses to living in  flyover country  or the  basket of deplorables  or whatever the elite lefties are calling us this week.
I know I do
makes ya wonder if he would ve gotten away with it if all he did was pick up the backpack and walk right back out of the room.but anyone that bad with a screwdriver Im guessing still has a few screws loose.
I always like that phrase.  it definitely applies here.
at least he got an award.
@charles caulkins  awards paid in lead are of... dubious value  -
grappling would serve them better
not going to say the fool didn t get what he asked for but with proper training  a well executed take down and the screwdriver would have never been a factor
@jared thorne  the people who put him down already received  the proper training  thats why they re here and the thief isn t
@jared thorne  this is completely undeniably untrue a weapon is a force multiplier it doesnt matter how well trained in close quarters combat a person is all it takes is one lucky strike with a weapon and its game over.
@jared thorne  thats not how anything works  a weapon of any kind is a huge advantage  and melee weapons specially in close range outrank even guns ... a close-quarters fight vs a melee weapon user could be over in few seconds and the person attacked could find themselves with several stab wounds  some of which could be deadly  before they could defend themselves or draw their gun.
fighting an untrained fighter is often much more dangerous than fighting a trained one.
this reminds me of that funny scene in the otherwise forgettable robocop 3  where the guy comes into a doughnut shop and pulls a gun on the cashier  and then he hears the sound of about 2 dozen guns cocking  and as the camera pans over he sees that the doughnut shop is full of cops.the cashier says  tell me  what s it like being a rocket scientist
this is basic use of force doctrine.  if you are resisting arrest and you throw a punch  you get the baton.  if you bring out a weapon capable of causing loss of life or grievous injury  your life has become forfeit.anyone defending themselves  or law enforcement lawfully making an arrest  has no obligation to fight with a violent individual on a level playing field.  it is always ethical to escalate force at least 1 level higher than what you are recieving  or about to recieve  from the other side.and as to the question of shooting a fleeing suspect in the back  well he just potentially killed someone... you dont let him out in society to do more of that.  he has shown he will kill 1  so you have to assume he will kill more.  he cannot be allowed to escape.  if he didn t want to die  he could have surrendered peacefully.
btw  this attack happened in las vegas  nv early last year. the female officer survived her injuries. the male officers and the three samaritans were not charged.
as an introvert I hate when people assume that Im depressed. being introverted doesnt automatically mean depressed.
my favourite story like this was about a guy that tried to rob an abattoir with a knife  it didn t end well for the guy. this is easily comparable.
Ive been a theatre technician at my university for 5 years  one of the things we discuss and touch on in training and throughout the year is how to respond to threats to life during a show. it is a real risk because our auditorium can and has brought in controversial shows that created protests  as well as political figures  and with some anticipated changes we are looking at potentially bringing in more political and controversial figures that can result in crazies doing crazy things. with this  we are constantly aware of how we canturn anything into a weapon to stop the threat to life  and you d be surprised how many common items can be used to quickly injure or kill someone xd
heck around and find out  has to be my new favorite quote. that is amazing.
the mental health crisis of this day and age is ridiculous.-cordially  sauron
not only do you have a good video  you have a good pc.  congrats.
I get so tired of people acting wild and having to be put down.  just chill  guy  be part of society.  its not that hard to just get along with others.  someone has to be deliberately trying to dislike people to act like this.
Im an introvert myself and I can be in really quiet  stoic  solitary and ect  but get me in the right mood and I will be really joke  especially with dark humor  like the guy that got caught was screwing around only to get a few more orifices where there shouldn t be any.
Ive been training in filipino martial arts and self defense for just under 10 years. anyone who actually practices learns many things including 1  anyone who tells you height and weight dont matter is lying to you  and 2  the moment a weapon like a knife  a gun  or even a decent sized stick comes into play  its life or death and all bets are off. Im so damn tired of ignorant people talking about hand to hand combat like you cantrain for a little bit and suddenly you can do knife and gun disarms without fail and  minimize harm.  its utter nonsense!
I was expecting a story like the scene from 1 of the robocop movies where a guy tried to rob the donut shop filled with cops.
dayum! 1 cop   3 employees opened up.  sounds like they are good instructors!  totally justified imho.the only thing dumber is the guys who tried to rob a gun store . his prize was delivered by a man who didn t even have to stand up. my state just went constitutional carry   we re going to seminar in 2 weeks to learn the ins   outs   do   dont do. my husband has had his concealed for years but I never got mine.
wow thatstudent left his gun in a bag unattended while he was out of the room  hope thats what the instructor spent the rest of the day talking about.
seen this across a few the self defense yt channels.   the thieve attacked with deadly force and he ended up with the room temperature challenge
as an introvert  I understand. still waters run deep. if Im being funny  its because humor is my defense method when Im uncomfortable.
fun fact  underoath is from my lil podunk town in florida  and the last time they played here  they chastised the crowd for wanting to hear old school songs  so they ended up getting boo ed off stage. they changed their original sound as og members started to leave the band  eventually getting to where they are now. they ve since denounced being from here lol.
so I think this means he failed the class  right   got a big ole  f  for  f    around and find out .   I would love to hear the thought process he went through to think this was a good idea.
I believe your take about the  justified  shooting is actually the popular opinion amongst sane humans. it would be the only opinion if the mainstream media could just figure out a way to profit from telling the truth.
I still say its a coin flip for the civilians shooting him but certainly the cop has an obligation to shoot.
nice!
how to defend yourself from a man with a banana
@tiny metal trees  you unleash the tiger
or people would read through the damn article instead of the headline
its so cute when people are creative with their euphemisms. I think  heckin  around  is now a permanent part of my vocabulary.  d
Im more introvert. sure  when I used to play in concert  marching  and jazz bands  I wasn t nervous  because performing on stage is entirely different than  being out in a crowd of people.
I love watching these videos. good info and cute host. I hope I dont get diabetes consuming daily eye candy.
I agree  if the character isn t preaching to me that Im some kind of phone  ist  or ism then its a character that I will most likely enjoy.if the character feels natural and isn t a forced addition that provides nothing to the story or another characters progression  then the character is fine.there s too many characters that preach to the player or feel like a chess piece in a checkers game.
and the darwin award this week goes to...
he was probably an activist who wanted to end up on the news for a shooting at a chl ltc class. they usually do stuff like this in hope of proving a point to get what they want accomplished.
Im all for this channel doing darwin award winner videos
now let s see if this man will be the next buy large mansion marter
0 45 lol  if you haven t already have audio from mic and camera go to separate audio tracks  when I was still recording things I had every single audio source record to a different track that way I could lay it in how I wanted later on  I also had a stand alone voice recorder going as a hard backup incase all else failed or effed up  the video could be salvaged reconstructed easier than audio for me as your first take on a reaction will always be the best.hope you set up redundancies in case of failure safety nets  itsucks needing to redo something
I dont know what the big issue was  the guy obviously just needed a little extra money to open up his new business  hookers and blow emporium right across from the police station  so he figured robbing a ccw class was equally as good of an idea.
the definition of introvert is  a shy  reticent person  if you aren t shy then you aren t an introvert.
I now know how not to make melonie mad. 1. dont talk down about classic tomb raider  lara croft. 2. dont tell her she s not introverted.  check and check. hahaha I swear that I wont do this. Imean I ll try. I cant promise anything. I ll probably forget though!
room temperature challenge  achievement unlocked successfully
grats on the new sponsor. still waiting to get my first. lolol.
the one time they dont tase him.
whether he got shot here or a couple hundred feet down the road after being chased  he was getting shot regardless. he wasn t going to surrender and he proved as much as soon as he pulled out a deadly weapon and began to fight. not to mention if he ran down the road and stabbed some innocent bystander in the neck  these same people would be claiming it was the cops fault for not stopping them sooner. there s no winning against that level of mental gymnastics and you ll never find agreement with tide pod eaters. best to just let them sulk in peace. they ll get over it.
the only way I could see this working is at the end or in the class when no should have a loaded gun  maybe except the instructor.
for his next trick  he will french kiss a rattlesnake
that video is old  but now Ive seen it twice again today.
oh  he just wanted to upgrade from his basic melee weapon to ranged. he forgot he wasn t playing gta and wouldn t respawn at a hospital.
phobe
10 50 also  on martial arts  knowing how to attack someone will help to an extent  but most martial arts is not teaching you how to handle yourself in a real fight  its teaching you their competitive rules  and Im about 50 50 if thats a good thing or not. but like you said  even if they did teach that  its not like movies where its the be all end all  best example of this is the chineses mma person who beat down chinese  traditional martial artists . the old ones may have been competitive a long time ago  but its been the better part of what 500 years since guns surplated martial skill or even just bodies on the ground to overwhelm melee combatants. these martial arts have long since been competitive rather than combative. that probably went a bit off topic.
introverts simply recharge better without outside interruption. has nothing to do with being outgoing or not. extroverts get their energy more efficiently from interacting with others while introverts are more likely to expend energy in the same situation. Im an outgoing introvert. I need alone time to recharge  but I like being around people and interacting with others.
similar to how mass effect 3 has different gameplay modes to suit different playstyles  e.g. the combat-centric mode that has more auto dialogue  the story-centric mode that has lighter combat  etc.   they could do something similar for the next tomb raider game  e.g. one mode with no auto grab  one mode thats more story centric  a mode with no cutscenes  etc.personally  I suck at platforming  so I d probably go with auto grab. I love solving puzzles  though  just as long as they dont require catlike reflexes.
if you look at the context of the verses forbidding tattoos  and context is always important  the Bible is talking specifically about ritual body mutilation as part of idol worship. Im not an expert on the language but my understanding is that the word for  tattoo  means something very different from what we think of when we say  tattoo  today. I also find it amusing that people who get bent out of shape over tattoos rarely have an issue with earrings  even though by their own logic any piercing constitutes bodily mutilation. I go to a conservative church but plenty of people there are inked up and no-one raises an eyebrow at any of my tats  one of the elders even complimented my celtic cross  so Im a little surprised Christians still give people grief over it but I guess legalists are gonna do what they do. pretty sure God only cares about tattoos if you get something really lame.
.....I feel like this is the last place you would want to rob.
in most states  once you commit a violent felony  even if you are fleeing  lethal force is on the table. also of note is that the rules for self defense and the defense of others are entirely different for the citizens present. police have a much stronger ruleset to follow. private citizens  even ones carrying  have a much lower criteria.
clear as day!!!! hey evaded and assaulted an officer with a weapon. it doesnt matter if it was a screw driver. he literally attempted to kill the officer. this isn t about race or was unjust  if he would of just cooperated he would still be alive. excessive force no he stabbed an officer and can be a danger to the public. he chose his fate unfortunately.  prayers for the officer who was injured and to the family of the suspect that lost his life.
I saw one yesterday on asp  2 guys run I to a gun shop and immediately started firing at the owner  the own got hit but lived  and also shot both of them  killing the main gunman
taping  idiot attempts to rob a concealed carry class  a second time shows true perseverance.   in these situations cops are trained to shoot to kill  which is why you never mess around with them.  if anybody is asking Im pro  wood-chipper and state rights.  also  I find the landwork super heavy duty 7hp gas powered wood chippers are best.  they are  multi-functional  just kidding btw.
this was fun vid.
hm. not sure where this took place  but when I took my cc class back in 2016  at a gun range in wisconsin   we were all told firearms were not allowed in the classroom. granted  there was no practical exam  but if there had been  there could ve been a short break between classroom and practical where folks could go out to their vehicles and retrieve their firearms for it.just seems ... odd.
underoath is my favorite band on the planet. Im not a religious person at all but good music is good music. you have phenomenal taste.
I know martial arts and got robbed at gun point by 2 guys with guns  martial arts has its limits I fully support having protection  having a gun  I would fully recommend anyone having a hand gun at least.
fairly certain you can if the  person fleeing literally attempted felony murder in front of you
good men who defended the officers.
no I think  they need to give all of the licensing to  sony  sony interactive studios    because tomb raider wouldn t of been so big  so massive  so well known if it wasn t for the sony playstation    and then they should give all of the development back to core design with a new and old team working toward.
I disagree in hoping these people dont ever have to get in a fight  we should have tournament arcs in school and at work to put people s priorities into perspective. keep itsafe  give people a foam bat and see who is the best at fighting. lol you cant be concerned with people making you feel not overweight when youre obese if you are working through the reality that the shy  scrawny girl completely dominated you  you gotta get in shape  lose the weight  train and get a rematch and then when you win you can bully her into making you feel good about being obese... wait  you got slightly in shape to win  it doesnt matter anymore and she wants to be your friend now because you care about bettering yourself and thats the only reason she ever said anything. fyI  I am being a little facetious for those that dont pick up on written humor
my expectations  subverted!
I dont leave my house without my sig sauer p365 9mm in my we the people inside the waistband iwb carbon fiber holster   north american arms derringer 5 shot revolver .22 wmr in my pocket. Ive been attacked 3 times  2 the firearm was present and deescalated it. the time I wasn t armed  didn t go well for me. I ll never make that mistake again. not only do I carry the sig with 10 1 rounds in it  carry a backup 12 round magazine  and a backup firearm of the revolver derringer .22 wmr  magnum  and I dread the day it ll be tested beyond show or unholstering. simple answer is  keep your hands to yourself  do not initiate physical aggression. I know I wont  all I can do is defense.
I have to wonder if this guy was feeling suicidal.
why do people try to spin it like the criminal is the victim  nine times out of ten its people who have literally never been in or dealt with genuinely bad people situations!they literally think that all conflicts can be solved by  talking it out. a well-meaning ideal but growing up in bad neighborhoods Ive known guys who are straight-up evil.as in capable of doing worse things to people than you ve ever seen in a horror movie which means  talkin it out  is not an option.
yeah  this isn t the police shooting to get upset about.there was a situation filmed a few years ago where a special needs guardian was trying to coax an autistic guy back and somebody called the police and the police thought a toy truck the autistic guy was playing with was a gun and they ultimately got the guardian instead to lay down and prove he was unarmed and then an officer shot the guardian in the leg while he was laying down and the officer said he didn t know why he shot him. thats something to be upset about because something went seriously wrong with those officers  training.someone that attacks an officer unprovoked and gets shot  no.
who teaches people to leave a gun in their car unattended    thats kinda crazy.
@jr clark  its called locking your firearm in your vehicle  preferably in a secured  locking case under your seat.
@nate lenz  yep.  thats crazy.
nope  that is not what any gun law Ive ever read allows.  you can shoot to prevent or stop crimes from occurring.  but once the person turns and runs away he is no longer immediately engaging in a crime so the shooting is not allowed because he is no longer an imminent threat.  shooting someone currently assaulting someone is defense  shooting someone in the back as they run away is retribution.
@me myself i  fleeing from police immediately after committing felony attempted murder and not knowing if he had another weapon on his person.  I guess police have to wait for a potential fair gun duel first
@set zor  no  apparently youre clueless.  as Ive said on here the police are probably reasonably safe for having taken action against him.  but multiple civilians shooting him are most likely not safe according to the law and could be convicted of crimes or at the very least sued civilly and lose all their money.  there is a huge difference between a police officer acting in this situation and an average citizen.
people forget that  while one feature of playstation games  like tomb raider and ffviI  was the fmvs  the other aspect is they wanted to make good games  too.
this happened in las vegas february 2021.  I betcha this dude is a product of california s catch and release.
good on the police and employees. I cant wait to see how the media spins this one
3 34 __a screw driver is not a  deadly weapon  -- its a tool
when it comes to some of these shows ill give it a pass on it being woke so long as the established ip isn t compromised and if its actually good.
all parties where lucky he didn t get the firearm he obviously was looking to do in the ccw class. cops with tazers would have maybe ended with the knucklehead still alive just violently twitching like crazy.
I dont trust agents of the state in general  though I am not one of those a.c.a.b. idiots either  but this case is textbook open and shut.
the officers made the right call in this situation. things could have ended up worse if they didn t take immediate action.
genius
imagine defending the criminal who was killed attacking people with a deadly weapon and believing you are being virtuous.
its not open carry  its constitutional carry  meaning you can carry open or concealed without a license
just a thought  I d never leave my gun in a room full of people and leave the room. glad the thug is room temperature though.
anytime you see someone questioning an obviously justified shooting  or trying to make an attacker into a victim  expect really fucking stupid hot tales from them. you ll never be shocked when you approach it like that. you ll only have to fight to manage the overwhelmingly smug urge to laugh as you see them blow right past your wildest expectations.
good shoot.
they people that are most vocal about gun laws and banning them seemingly appear to believe that there wouldn t be any violence  or crime if there were no guns  and that makes me think of a conversation from a game  time hollow if youre curious  were a character tried to stop a murder  but the explained that no matter what happened they couldn t stop it  the person would stab them  so they hid the knife  so then they used a rock  so the removed the rock  so they found another way  its the same with all crime  if someone is set on doing something  they dont need a gun to do it they will find a way
they dont know if he didn t get a gun but had the screwdriver handy. what had happened if he went to the corner store and took their gun after they let him go  or it becomes a hostage situation  maybe he kills a kid.  I dont like guns necessarily but I have been toiling with the idea as unfortunately police cant be everywhere.
the best thing about most criminals is that they are usually the stupidest of all.
Im a little concerned about four people opening fire on the guy with a freeway in the background  but it was definitely a justified shooting.so glad you mentioned about introverts not always being shy. I cant stand crowds and really dont like talking to people  but people dont believe I am an introvert because I am very social at work. thing is  I am social at work because I supervise a team of four other people. as far as I am concerned  getting to know them and making them feel comfortable enough to come to me with concerns is literally my job. so even though I absolutely hate doing it  every month or two I hold a team event where we can all get together and have fun. to me  these events are stressful as heck  but my team enjoys them  so I do it.
introverts  my thoughts     I think to myself   if I get into this crowd what happens if I have to get out of it  best be cautious .look for signs driving a truck is the same way
glad he was taken care of before he could kill anyone.  so many people dont realize that one single stab takes a splitsecond and can  and has millions of times throughout history  end a life.a screwdriver  skateboard  knife  baseball bat....all deadly weapons that call for deadly force to be used in response.  I was a bouncer in college and someone in the crowd walked by a guy and stabbed him so fast right in the heart  nobody even saw who did it and the guy bled out and died before emergency services even got there.  one jab  done.  the victim said  something stung me  and then collapsed.
life must be different from the cheap seats. these same people wouldn t help the officer  instead would whip out their phones.....
every ccw class Ive taken they had us leave our guns locked in our car for the class portion. Im not sure if that is standard or some california law  but multiple companies Ive gone to to renew my license did the same.
and remember out here in rural america the cops can be hours away.
@big_pete bear  I live in a small town with few cops it doesnt have to be rural. also see how these idiots fight and argue with cops taking them out of service for people who need them.   I say if they argue then arrest for suspicion and move on. when they are dropped off let someone in office finish investigation or let them call their lawyer and get cops back on patrol!
I think it boils down into  we re the instructors within their right to fire ..from what I know of self defense laws in tx  and I know every state is different ..once the dude runs off he is no longer a threat to you or the person they were assaulting  so they would not be justified in the shoot.  however  the police officer is a different situation altogether .I 100  agree  he got what he deserved  as far as the law goes .those guys may be in for a rough ride  that being said  as  cc instructor  Im sure they are read up on the current laws
hair on point today at least
introverted and extroverted do not mean non-sociable and sociable. its how one processes information and where they get energy from. introvert   internal thinking and extrovert   outward thinking. introverts get energy from being alone and are drained by being in social enviroments while extroverts are the opposite. shame that there is still a negative stigma around being an introvert.
excuse me sir !   looks like youre screwed yourself real good
people s issue isn t that youre  ok  with gay characters  etc. people are upset that you said youre  all about  it and celebrate it  your words in the video .we are not to condemn people for their sin  but we are also not to celebrate people s sin. thats the issue.maybe you misspoke  maybe there s some sort of disconnect between what you mean and what people are hearing  Im not sure.as always  no disrespect  just attempting to clarify.
what a world with armed upstanding citizens looks like a man walks into a bank with a gun  demanding everyone get down on the ground and give up their valuables.. everyone turns  drawing pistols on the robber and say  no sir  you get on the ground. citizens arrest. the robber panics under pressure  runs to the exit to get out of there as fast as possible  but accidentally shoots himself in the leg while jostling the door handle  severing an artery. the robber dies.. his family learning from his mistake. the city is now safer than it once was.fin
yer an irish lass ta the bones! no sir s gonna force their potatoes on ya again!
bruh screw river is a deadly weapon at a melee range  its not a bazooka.there was no need to shoot bullets at him  you have taser guns for these situations   its like a warzone there.did they even aim for the legs.
make sure its  feed feet first.  fir that wood chipper.
most cops could definitely use more training. more training is always good. the problem is making the time for it. if we want cops to be experts in martial arts  firearms and criminal law  cops will be spending almost all of their time in training and class rooms instead of patrolling and being a cop. marksmanship and martial arts are a perishable skill. it cant be taught once at the academy and every police office retains that for ever. you need training on a regular basis. something many departments dont have the man power for. every officer training is an officer not patrolling.
these same people would suggest  as the president has  that they should have tried to shoot him in the knee  or to just let him go. these people have not had training  nor were they at the scene. they would not know what woulda   coulda  shoulda been done. the officers andy the instructors did as they were trained  shoot center mass  and keep shooting until the threat is over.
you need to watch  surviving edged weapons   and review it. or  at least  just watch it.
love the sinner  hate the sin  - Jesus is love and Jesus loves everyone.  should we sin   no.  does Jesus love youregardless   yes.
so... you boomered the first recording
gun laws even in very republican states dont generally allow someone to shoot a person who is running away with their back turned.  plus this occurred at a business  gun laws are usually far more favorable on your own personal property where you live.  you can shoot someone who is attacking or attempting to harm someone in order to stop them  but once they stop and start fleeing you cant shoot them because they have stopped and are no longer an immediate threat.  the police officer is far more likely to get away with such a shooting since they have qualified immunity and its their job to deal with such things.  there is no argument that the guy was a violent  and stupid  criminal who assaulted a police officer with a deadly weapon.  and it was caught on camera!  the guy deserved what he got.  but the civilians who shot - they could potentially face consequences or civil suits from the criminal s family.  they should have let the remaining police officer handle it and only gotten involved if that 2nd police officer was attacked   disabled.
yes you are within your rights to shoot someone who just attempted murder in front of you and is actively fleeing  save taxpayer dollars and put the animals down!
hey Im a brit and agree with ya.
trying to rob a conceal carry class is dumb.  you have to figure everyone is armed.  attacking officers with a screwdriver is just plain stupid.  once you start stabbing someone with a screwdriver  the officers are completely justified in using deadly force.  seems pretty clear cut to me.  people who think the cops should have taken him down with some martial arts move have been watching too many action movies.
im not american  can someone explain me this  oh he was fleeing  you shouldn t have shot  thing  Imean he was fleeing for a reason.. so you have to stop him somehow  altho I imagine it would be prefered in a non lethal way . hypotheticly  a dude kills someone with a melee weapon  then sees guns pointed at him  starts running and you supposed to run after him  is it what this about  I dont get it
regardless of the martial arts or self defense training  if they shot him as he was attacking the officer its justifiable. if they shot him after the fact as he was attempting to flee they will likely be convicted for their  heroics .seems like a pretty cut and clear case of  suicide my cop  I dont see any reason not to believe he went into that class with that outcome intended. and likely was foiled by the handgun in the bag having a trigger lock on it as it was not under its owners immediate control.
thatsounds ideal but dont lose sight of reality. its more likely that we ll never reach that point.
take a defensive gun class and you will see why everything you said is wrong.
very true  not worth the lawsuits
they could most likely be charged for shooting as he was fleeing.  but seeing how it was all on camera  including the deadly assault on the police officer and this was in response to a police officer being attacked - they probably wont be charged.  if I were them I d be more concerned with possible civil suits.
he never attempted to flee. he took like two steps back facing them when they shot. the last frames are him turning and falling after he s already been shot.there s also some gray area depending on state. here in texas  you d be able to use deadly force to stop someone attempting to flee a crime as serious as attempted murder.
did you fear for your life or the life of others  yes. good job stopping the threat.
this is the dumbest take Ive heard yet. if 6 people opened fire  while  the attack was happening the cop would be dead from a stray. they waited 2 extra seconds for a clear target who was in no way fleeing.
@john  it is literally impossible to fear for your life from someone who has their back turned and is running away.  that is a guaranteed 100  loss in court.  self defense is never justified if the other person is fleeing and is not an immediate threat.  it does not matter at all what they did previously  if they are currently fleeing you can not shoot them out of self defense.
@jedimasta yoda  that is the dumbest take Ive heard yet.  assuming they aren t incompetent with their firearms at that range they should have been able to hit their target without shooting someone else  aka  stray  .  but civilians are only justified in shooting to protect their lives or the lives of another in   immediate danger  .  which means as soon as the suspect turned and started to flee there was zero justification for any of them to shoot him legally.  they literally murdered him according to the law.  note that Im pro-gun and a gun owner myself.  but one has to know and understand the related gun laws or they are little more than an idiot with a gun.  shooting is only justified in response to an immediate threat  its impossible for someone who has their back turned and is fleeing to qualify as an immediate threat.
sorry mel but gonna have to disagree with you with the martial arts comment. anybody with any degree of actual combat training  boxing  muay thaI  jujitsu  will always trump over someone with none regardless of size. thats why a 5 4 chick with a blue belt in jujitsu can strangle a man twice her size with no training experience. truth is cops aren t trained well. thats why most cops are overweight and crack under pressure. not saying its their fault. but if its your job to protect people you should be training on the daily.
he was just jogging around the neighborhood. oops  wrong video
guy   I was wondering that too  and Im a brit mel   of course youre a brit! me   huh  I think people like that dont think in the larger picture. if he was able to flee and escape  Lord knows who he could ve hurt. the reason he stabbed them isn t because it was a cop that was holding him  its because someone was holding him  he would ve done it to anyone. so acting like he is only dangerous to cops is foolish. twitter people man. people also need to know the difference in cops behaviour and tactics comes down to difference in gun laws. in uk  a cop will ask you to step out of the vehicle. whereas in america a cop will take you stepping out as a sign  you are asked to stay in until they assess the situation  or so is taught. but what do I know  Im a brit.
I think you should check out goodfight ministries.
melonie   do you own a gun
Im at 7 51 ... have so many things to say ... Im english ... cant wait for verse of the day
darwin award
jeez  that poor truck. used as a back stop
I stopped using twitter 1. sewage 2. honestly not sure if trolls or serious mental disabilities.
so if you let the guy go what happens next  think about the next victim s family. its sad but reality is not unicorns and rainbows.
talk about  go boom
the twitter comments. gotta blame the people defending themselves and or others.
he he melonie id bring up my brit accent to you but that was 42 years ago
this should have been two separate videos
they did society a favor and saved the taxpayers a lot of money.
I wonder if the guy was anti- gun  that would be interesting if it was the casenext gen story telling   start over and ruin the ip
that looks like my home town maybe  vegas. mess with the cop  get the glock.

martial arts  riiiiigggghhhhhttt
nah this is how I run my daily show. talk about a topic  answer previous video comments  and end in a verse. itshould be exactly as I want it to be.
@melonie mac go boom  you do you keep up your hard work
vegas   really.  good to know.  I was thinking about moving there in the future.  been wondering what the gun laws are like in nevada.
@me myself i  open carry state  but I obviously recommend getting a ccw we dontt have crazy arms restrictions like california and other deep blue states.
@acemac  Im actually more familiar with arizona which allows concealed carry without a permit.
@melonie mack go boom     I am an introvert as well -- it ain t just you...

people who advocate for martial arts to replace a firearm against an armed murderer have no clue wtf they re talking about. you do not put yourself in any scenario where you can lose out.-anybody can be trained in martial arts lmao for all they know  this man is a black belt in 3 different martial arts. never underestimate your enemy. -if you stab an innocent person  you deserve whatever comes next.-5 steps to escalation of force  shout  show  shove  shoot  shoot to kill  they followed that to a tee lmao and it also goes to show that even when they do everything right an officer might be dead
suicide by cop  get rich quick  scheme.
he got what he deserved and literally asked for. criminals take notes  civilians are armed and ready to drop your a55e5.
all these leftists calling it  murder  is too hilarious.
wasted!
he was not a good brudda...he did not knoe de wae to de queen.....spit on im bruddas!
fyI - this story is a year old.  not sure why its being covered here as if its current news.  I found stories describing this  it happened in las vegas  showing the same images that were written in february 2021.
melonie  keep your naturally wavy hair from now on. no straightening. embrace your natural beauty.
gotta love it. stupid games equal stupid prizes. for the dummy. for the rest of us  it means we win too. one less animal on the loose because the da wont prosecute nor keep him in jail.
having a single black guy in the room shoulda set off the alarms anyway. I joke  but still...
why should a cop risk his life by using none lethal force to save the life of someone who is using lethal force  what you see on tv isn t real.
saw a threat  neutralize the treat! another person trying to harm innocent people  off the streets! good riddance!!!
God made mankind  guns just make us all equal. and futher more  criminals dont follow the laws and the laws dont protect you. be safe  be a hard taget  and have a plan a-z.
he had just stabbed an officer and they needed to neutralize the threat before they could make sure the officer was taken care of.  I am sorry  but he fucked around and found out.  I know the race hustlers are going to jump all over this  but I dont care how much melanin you have  you do this and we no longer need you in the gene pool.  the officers do need better training but the woman was out-classed and the dude went straight for killing blows to the head and neck.  you are not going to react well if someone punches a hole in your neck with a screwdriver.  stop watching hollyweird super-feminist movies where 99 lb. women throw around 250 lb. men with ease.  physics and biology are actual things  despite what the alphabet mafia and their goons think think.
bruhhh... this man is crazy... I dont want to live on this planet anymore...
good riddance  natural selection at work.
aren t you a Christian  what about the part that talks about the body being the temple and you aren t supposed to alter it... personally I dont care  im not a Christian.  its just funny to me how people hold onto these ideas but pick and choose what parts to follow... either you believe in God and the whole Bible is his word  or youre effectively saying God got that part wrong... the all knowing omniscient being...
yup
when I saw the second strike and that officers head snapped to the side - that was it! game over for you pal.
joke to you  murder is
@chaosinfusion
it just showed up on my twitter so I thought it was new lol
