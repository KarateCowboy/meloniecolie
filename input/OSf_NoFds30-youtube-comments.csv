considering that the design for the predator looks like the old artwork for japanese onI  I really think that a predator set in feudal japan would be awesome  imagine the predator fighting samurai
predators was where the franchise ended  was all I needed from a final film  I loved it. but I try to give things a fair chance so I ll see where this one goes. keep up the great work!
alot of people who never read the books comics may not know there was a woman who went with the predators an became one herself. the girl at the end of avp was supposed to go w the predators and become one. so its normal to see a strong female in the predator comics. this does look good an want to watch it.
this looks clean  refreshing. I love the native as the antagonist  old weapons etc  . looks good!
a big issue that people have with it  including your mutuals here on yt - I know of some of whom that youre speaking about  is that a teenage girl is gonna take out the predator  when arnold  in his prime  had a tough time with fighting against one  who ultimately ended up taking himself out because he was mortally wounded.  on that note  the trailer certainly makes it look more like its not just on her to take out the predator.  I have hulu still  so I ll watch it.  the commercials will be a distraction  but Im not upgrading since I have .99 a month till november.  I ll reserve judgement till I see it.oh and one neat thing is that you can watch a dub of it comanche.  that might actually make it more immersive.
a lot of the criticism Ive seen leveled at this project has been about the adolescent female protagonist training to be a warrior in the strongly patriarchal comanche nation. not that it couldn t happen  but in a nation that  to my understanding  didn t have a tradition of female fighters  like the apache  most people consider it unlikely enough to be suspicious of w0  e pandering.
honestly  im really digging this trailer!! and I really cant wait to watch this.
I think this looks good  Im actually looking forward to watching it now. I was hesitant at first because I like the main character from the avp book prey machiko noguchI  but this only share s the title and is its own story.
I think this looks like it has a lot of potential and looks fun. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
it is worth giving it a chance. my main concern is just what studios are doing with existing ip these days. I dont have a lot of trust for them. it used to be that when I heard thatsomething I liked was getting turned into a show I would get excited to see it  now my first thought is  please dont ruin this too.
same for me. 80 s baby here and predator 1   2 have a special place in my collection! but I do think prey looks good enough to see and streaming is always easy so  we ll see I guess!
the predators returning to earth or even showing up in the past makes sense to me. they are for the hunt and a hunter wouldn t want to cause their prey to go extinct. especially if this hunter had advanced technology and if the prey was a sentient creature able to learn  improvise  adapt  and overcome.
it looks like the best predator film Ive seen since alien vs predator and that was 18 years ago. Im hyped
looks awesome!!! cant wait to see it!!!
I am so excited for this movie.
Im gonna keep it a buck this looks pretty fuckin  decent! I always loved seeing the predator in a different time period. Imean in the dark horse comics a predator fought a pirate and took his flintlock only to give it to danny glover in the 90 s. I dont wanna get my hopes up after the last flick but I really like the tone of this trailer
more of your dog in the videos please!
I have to be balanced here. start with the basics  predator is the all-time greatest action movie to me. and predator 2 indicates that predators have been hunting on the earth for hundreds of years when the elder predator gives harrigan the old flintlock pistol. its even possible that they select more primitive weapons when hunting less advanced societies. and I agree the trailer is well-done and looks tense and scary. I also loved 10 cloverfield lane  far better than either of the other 2 cloververse films   which Ive pointed to before as a great example of how to do a strong female lead properly. the film is written by patrick aison  who has only written about 4 episodes of tv shows  but that includes an episode of tom clancy s jack ryan that I thought was particularly good.  season 1  before it went woke and imploded  Im guessing the  white guys  will be french fur traders... and will probably be evil  the film s treatment of them will be a major determinant in whether its good or not. as for naru herself  she comes across as more of a tom-boy than a feminist  and I liked that itshows her training and even failing. female vulnerability is a feminist writer s kryptonite  so Im keeping an open mind on this one.  also  2018 s the predator had a predominantly alpha-male cast and it was almost as bad as aliens vs predator  requiem  the absolute bottom of the predator barrel  also... holy crap  is she wearing predator blood as war-paint   !!! that is the awesomest thing Ive ever seen! final judgment  it looks good  and Im pleasantly surprised by that. I think I ll watch it and find out. sincerely  lane from canada. go boom!
this trailer makes us represent of how predator gets to be sneaky and silent like in the first film. also the predator clicking is satisfying throughout the trailer!
excited for this. definitely looks better than avp or predators.
yeah it would  but I want see cleopatra predator in egypt  and the samuraI predator
we already got a predator fighting a samuraI 2 movies agogranted it was a yakuza with a katana but still
the biggest problem with predators is they focused on a bunch of juvenile delinquents forced to attend remedial predator summer camp so they could graduate predator high school. itshould have focused on the predator that kidnaps prisoners out of maximum-security penitentiaries  has the detective skills to track suburbanite serial killers  and raids special forces squads for  volunteers .
the dog alone tell me they didn t do basic research natives like wolves not dog
I loved predators. this one looks excellent though. I bet this ties into the end of predator 2.
id rather have itset in space but they wont do that....
@jack straw  actually  predators 2 was suppose to be set in space. royce and isabelle were suppose to be on a ship headed home with predators on board. it was suppose to play out like  die hard.
@jack straw  but nobody really appreciated predators so they left the idea for the 2018 crap
the one in the comics was an outlier and even though she earned a spot in the tribe  was never considered an equal and could never compete with the males.
machiko was a badass
thats true  it is an issue for me that they choose a teenage girl that isnt supposed to even be a hunter  as I understood it from the trailer  so she has no training from the tribe probably. there are a bunch of highly experienced hunters in that tribe  why not one of them  that would make more sense in all aspects  a native american hunter that has many years of experience hunting and surviving in the wild  now that would be believable.
thats what puts me off on it
@dstoltenberg  it might be good  but the sad thing is that the lack of research knowledge about the mc s culture1  raises questions with people who know something about comanche culture  and I ll admit  my own knowledge is limited . and 2  I kinda feel like the incoming counter argument is going to be    insert tribe  had women warriors  comanche are also american indians  therefore its fine to have a woman comanche warrior because they re the same thing. even to your everyday person who s not an american indian  I imagine thatsounds kinda bigoted. itsure does to me.
to be fair  the trailer seems to show that the rest of her nation doesnt support her training  so it could still be an accurate portrayal of their traditions. I just hope they allow the story of her getting stronger to speak for itself  rather than constantly bashing the message over the audience s heads.
@dom philbrick  true. there is a way to tell that kind of story correctly and it has been done very well before  1997 mulan  brave  the original 70 s lady snow-blood film series  etc. . Im reserving my ultimate judgment until it comes out  but at the same time  I can see why some people are worried.
maybe  the white colonials will provide the ideal indirect help  as in a distraction for the predator. pretty sure they ll be majority of the new movie s body count and not the comanche warriors. which then the female hero will be the  brains  in strategizing to fight the predator and make the final blow. this is the perfect tool for modern hollywood to showcase its  love  for colonial era america  by having as many of the white extras here fill the body count meter.
some people take things waaaay too seriously  its just a fukin movie  who cares if main character is a female  male  a fish  mickie mouse etc its fictional
the comanche nation also didn t have a strong tradition of fighting off aliens from space also so........
@gamebiker theatre gt  its not about white male leads  its about the story making sense in the context of the story. the mc from one of the main avp novel series in the 90s-00s was a japanese woman. and it made sense in the setting.conversely  a pubescent young woman becoming a warrior in an iron-age  hyper-masculine hunter gatherer culture with no history of women warriors and whose warfare is still primarily carried out hand-to-hand isn t very likely. if its done well  written well and it makes sense  people will probably love it. but as a storyteller  you cant establish a setting  break immersion  and then get mad at the audience for not liking the story whose immersion you broke.
@ghost  its because we are sick of movies with the liberal  message   shoved in our face. thats what they are talking about. I am excited for this movie. it looks good

yea im also of the few that liked avp and its sequel esp the fight scenes...
agreed melonie.... prey looks good I will give it a look when it is released great video cheers
its an easy choice  but alas  people are stupid put that on a tee-shirt  a bumper sticker  something - it applies to so much
hey melonie! I remember about a year and some ago  this movie when mentioned was criticized as a supposed ripoff to a fan film named warrior something cant remember the name  although I disagree since idea could have come from previous dark horse comics to give an example.. maybe some of the hate comes from that episode last year. anyways  love your content  cheers from dominican republic..
I haven t been disappointed by the predator franchise yet and it looks like this prequel is gonna keep up that winning streak.
melonie  the trailer does look interesting.  I think some people will automatically become cautious when they see a female lead anymore.  I really dont remember all this hoopla when I was a teenager about ellen ripley and sarah conner.
youre pretty awesome woman and telling Bible verses on every video makes it more awesome than ever  we need people like you to be truthful and kicking the devil s butt  I just came across it today and its a great channel on youtube that loves games and Christ  keep being awesome and God bless you!  hugs!
amber midthunder is a rising star  and at age 24 when she filmed this  she already has an impressive body of work. she wouldn t need to attach herself to a dying franchise.
I think it looks good too! she seems smart enough to watch to see what doesnt work and figure out other strategies. yes its far fetched that a woman can beat it in hand to hand combat but out smarting it is possible.
your dog is so cute! quite the attention seeker at times. great verse of the day segment too
Im sooo proud this gives natives a good look
I think a lot of the hate for the movie is because they made the protagonist a small ish  female  in a franchise started by arnold. I think normally nerdrotic and the others would look deeper  but there has been a pattern in movies shows lately that may be making them jump the gun. the one thing that bothered me about the trailer was the odd way they were drawing the bows. maybe the comanche really did it that way  I dont know   but it looks very odd  and not ideal to me.
it looks interesting  its weird she went from running from the bear to learning to fight quickly. I wonder if the predator will end up fighting with the girl after her tribe I slaughter by the guys with guns. alien vs predator kinda shown they have empathy
the best way to defeat wokeness in films is dont rush to watch it at the theatre. wait until its available on a streaming service.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that I have seen the 80 s version of the movie and I have seen the 2018 version of the movie and I thought it was awesome and cool movie to watch and so I just want to tell you that I can not wait to see the newer version of the movie and see how I would like it after I see it  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to make a comment about your video for today  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
also  in comics  predators have been defeated by all cultures throughout history. there is a reason they keep coming back to hunt humans. that reason is because we are worth hunting. they find us clever. we also remind them to never let your guard down and never fall to your own whimsey.there s one pred I remember reading about who died by an old man on safarI because he kept running and running the predator into danger areas  like a pride of lions  a pond reknown for being full of crocs  stuff like that. by the time the predator caught up he was so wounded and bleeding the old man just blasted him once with the elephant gun and done be done itself detonated. clever. I dont think a lot of these commenters know a lot about the yautja and or there race.
looks good  the only I roll part was at the beginning  why do you want to hunt   because you all think that I cant  other then that. it looks good. it also seams the predator is a little more  low tech  or not as advanced as other predators. unless some woke info comes out I think ill watch it.
I ll be watching that movie!!!!! looks awesome  wanna go see it with me mel
comanches  in calgary       alberta  canada  ...and 100  years before quanah s birth.  ...the film was shot in english and comanche  with the entire cast performing an alternate all-comanche dub of the film. because the film is being released through hulu  audiences can pick which language version they watch on the streaming service. now if only this hints at the connection to  alien   prometheus  sharing the same universe !!!
back in the 90s dark horse did a comic which was about an unarmed predator taking on a huge bear. the bear scene might be a nod to that  or might be coincidence.predators do nerf themselves for a more even battle. the predator even did this in the first film.
it looks like it will be good. it doesnt seem woke to me. fingers crossed that it will be a good movie. I love the predator movies.
thats the problem  that it will probably go down the typical road.
sounds like the comic  predator jungle tales  except it was an africantribesman with a spear. a much better story because its believable  the man was an experienced hunter himself who through experience of the land overcame the predator.no smashing gender norms  no identity politics  just a survival story.
I just noticed what looked like a small militia with guns in the trailer. Im calling it right now the pistol that the predator gave danny glover at the end of predator 2 is gonna make an appearance.
@randy riley  that would be so cool. but  I wouldn t think so because the pistol is from the 1700 s and is from a pirate the elder predator got from the pirate prey he was hunting. the private had his crew mutiny against himself and there ship was set upon by a galley of brits. the predator elder from the 2nd movie and the pirate temporarily teamed up. and when the preddy and the cap squared up. his barely living first mate shot him. stealing the elder yautjas pride of his kill. but before he died in the aliens arms. he gave him his flint lock pistol. from the 1700 s.prey takes place in the 1800 s I do believe.but am appearance. holy crap would that be so awesome for us fans.
@eddie brock  it was around  right after the first volume I know that.
@david hasselblad  unfortunately disney doesnt care about established canon. hell  they cant adhere to their own let alone previously created.
@eddie brock  you are right. Im hoping the crash of the star wars sequels woke em up a bitseeing as they are making a spin off series going lucas  direction. so hopefully they got shaken awake a little when it comes to this movie.
it looks more inspired than the predator and I like the different time period. I hope they are able to believably convey the protagonist being able to out fight a hulking creature like predator.
honestly melonie has a better chance of killing the predator than the chick that thought it was wise to shoot a grizzly bear with an arrow.
it looks f  awesome!
she didn t use mud to hide heat  she used a special flower that lowers body temp
really enjoyed the Bible verse discussion at the end!
this is actually the 1st predator movie that Im actually looking forward to
nothing will beat the 80 s  predator  its golden masculine eighties cheesiness and I love it.
melonie should play the alien vs. predator game by capcom.
outside the first one   am I the only one who actually really liked the 3 predator movie
80s babies 90s kids rise up.  stands up  pumps fist  then sits back down
its not that guys just like to watch girls. as youre basically the only female creator I watch. its a multifaceted thing. youre honest  atleast appear to be  idk you personally   youre attractive  youre based  and you seem like one of the guys.
I think the predator will refuse to kill the girl cause he doesnt see her as a worthy opponent the whole film until the very end. so he will probably kill everyone around her
the best thing about this traiier is the word  cioverfieid   Im stiiI hoping for a proper cioverfieid 2 btw  sorry for going off topic here
I was a bit apprehensive when it was first announced.but after this trailer  Im a bit excited about it!we ll see - I also liked the morbius trailer  and then them movie proved to be... not that great...
its not that the female lead is the problem  its disney s writing and storytelling that can be problematic at times. plus it will be pg-13 family friendly  no blood or gore.
teenage girl who cant do any serious damage to a grizzly bear  and is about to be eaten for lunch by it  is going to have a training montage and then take on a predator  lmao melonie what are you thinking xd
I wouldn t say it looked terrible  just not that impressive  standard action sequences   the bear  hunting  scene was odd  if the predator hadn t arrived she would have been eaten for sure  but then later in the trailer they try to portray her as some uber-hunter thats going to take on the predator.   those things are immensely strong  fast  has the tech   here the humans dont even have modern weaponry  I just dont see the point.Im sure the action sequences are going to be good  though it looks like it will be lots of cuts with shaky-cam  but I just dont find  that motivating enough as its the minimum they should have.
since you were asking melonie why your fellow content creators dont like it and if its woke  the company making it in prey s synopsis said the movie is about a female warrior battling gender norms.  not kidding. her name in the film is kee  which is comanche for   no.   she s a fierce warrior fighting gender norms  literally named  no...  hope that clears it up for you  love the content sorry if this ruins your hype for it lol...
as a native I am dam happy us natives are getting roles on major movies plus Im excited to watch it.
do a react to the resident evil trailer I saw it yesterday and I wanna see it definitely curious as to what you think about it.
its disney.
@gilbert 5452  yes but I imagine they are putting it out on hulu instead of wide release for a reason maybe because wide release requires them to have larger press wholl ask about that agenda.
I hope its halfway decent  Ive been quite disappointed in most films in general recently.
well said

thats the whole essence of predator.an action film turned upside down with a slasher element.
honestly who really cares this one still looks good in my opinion that one is outdated anyway.
I ll probably watch when its on tv or streaming services but I love older stuff and outdated is a matter of taste.  if you only like newer stuff more power to you.  80s stuff is great and never outdated to me. but I still love watching andy griffith show and sanford and son.
@antbaze97  a classic is never outdated. thats why predator and alien are still the top of the lists.
bruh. huh  it was untouched by disney.  they didn t cut any violence and gore.  the only thing disney have anything to do with on this  is the marketing  trailers etc  and distribution  streaming  selected cinemas etc .  they didn t write a single page of the script.  man  if you were concerned about disney actually having creative control and censoring this movie  youre gonna actually love it.
yep  that is the implied thing thatstands in the room. they would need to handle that with care and intelligence...
and unless the native americans found out the predator weakness  mud to cover the infrared  which we ve already seen  there isn t much new
every enemy has a weakness
looks really good
this actually may turn out pretty good. the idea of itsounded silly to me but seeing the trailer made me think this can possibly beat predator 1.
the first 2 predator movies were the best!
they never used hI tech weapons in the first predator to take him down. arnold basically went full primitive. if anything this would give the native americans an advantage. I think it looks freakin awesome. Ive been excited ever since I saw the poster. let s gooo!!
good reactions.
there is a comic book with a female main and she becomes a member of the yautja  predator . not saying this is that but its stupid to say its  woke  its badass
ahhhh like what you like. this should be cool for what its worth.
2 12 thought there was a bird behind me lol
I dont know enough about history to judge whether or not something is historically accurate but  in general  historical accuracy hasn t really been important in movies except where they emphasized accuracy. I didn t have a problem with wild wild west or shanghaI noon knights  even though they were blatantly inaccurate. Im with you  on its own  this would be an interesting premise if they made a true effort to balance the predator  given the fact that the predator race will actually give up their super advanced weapons in favor of a balanced and challenging fight  and didn t do any nonsense making the protagonists impossibly super powered.I think people are just pointing out that any content lately that has intersectional feminism turns out to be bad. i.e. women who are in roles typically given to men with no explanation how her role came to be  women lecturing men about things that are masculine to begin with  or in this case  a warrior woman who tells a warrior man thatshe is doing what she is doing to protect him when its hard to believe that the male warriors were not the protectors themselves. thats their culture.Im more confused about the technology this predator has a shield. I fell out of the predator franchise  but I dont remember them ever using defensive equipment apart from camo and emergency medical treatments. I guess  after this point in time  the predator race found that their defensive equipment gave them too much of an advantage and so they stopped using them the predator has the laser guidance lock-on technology of the shoulder-mounted cannon  but looked like this one only fired an arrow  its advanced enough to have laser technology and maybe cpu-assisted targeting but I guess its a shoulder mounted crossbow now this predator has camo  which I questioned if they would do thatsince that would mean the predator can just sneak around and do whatever it wants since bows and tomahawks are very slow even if they spot the predator for a second. sure  they cantell some story about how the warriors have better skills than the protagonists in the first predator movie  but then why would the predator have camo to begin with  its extremely advanced technology that the warriors could never even dream of  and giving them supernatural senses that defeats camo makes the whole thing pointless and begs the question  how could a race of supernaturally skilled warriors not be the dominant culture if the super advanced alien couldn t even beat them they showed guns  which I guess means the europeans arrive at some point and take on the predator  which would shift the focus away from the tribe  and the new threat becomes the ones with the guns  and the predator using a shoulder-mounted  laser-targeting crossbow seems very silly at that point. as we know  the predators are an alien race  which has spaceships  scanning equipment  and I assume they have better weapons than a crossbow  given how they have lasers  computer systems  and space travel. so why would the predator not have weapons to rival guns  knowing that this planet has guns  and  since the predator could scanthis planet and know that the europeans are the most powerful and dangerous hunt  why would the predator even bother with the tribes on another continent in the first place the warrior who I assume is the protagonist attached some sort of rope to a tomahawk  Im not 100  sure  but I think attaching a line to a tomahawk and then throwing it would make it extremely inaccurate  the tomahawk would also need to bear the weight of the rope as it flies through the air pulling the rope with itso it might just fall to the ground after maybe 10 feet. not to mention that yanking on the rope and causing the tomahawk to fly back at you would turn it into a deadly weapon against yourself. but  Im sure they re just going to make this warrior an expert who always catches it by the handle and never chops her own hand or worse as she tries to pull the weapon back to herself. never once had an accident while she developed and perfected her skills with a roped tomahawk that Im willing to bet no one has ever done before so she cant magically  learn by seeing others do it  either.granted  its still possible that everything is explained and turns out that they make sense. but these are the things that I am concerned about. people talk about the lore  source material  and historical context of ips  for instance  the Lord of the rings show. Im more quickly put off by the scene of  galadriel  leaping and plunging a dagger into a solid rock with 1 quick swing with no hammer  and even though it was that easy to get the dagger into the rock  its a strong enough anchor to hold her weight without the dagger slipping out just as easily. I find no entertainment value in movies or shows that put no effort into making things make sense or at least keep me interested enough to disregard quick moments that dont make sense.
I think it looks cool.
I dont have any major issue with the movie  but my first thought was   been there  done that . they ve had so many movies in the series so far  and this one doesnt look to be doing anything new  so I cant muster up any enthusiasm for it.
stay honest and keep peers and haters alike guessing! I just hope disney hulu can resist making a preemptive strike on fans yet again
great movie
you just gained a sub from me. I completely agree  I think it looks fun. we re in a weird place with pop culture and fandom these days. people have such strong opinions about everything and forget how to appreciate things based on their own merits and goals. people are forgetting how to have fun and get hung up on what cinemasins told them constitutes a good  worthy film.
thought it looked pretty cool  but she has a long way to go hunting if she thought a bow and arrow would take out a bear.
been loving your video going to basic training july 5 and been really enjoying your workout health videos are great motivation keep it up
its the very first line of the trailer thatshows why its woke. the very first line.  why do you want to hunt    because you think I cant.  strong empowered whaman gonna break the glass ceiling of native america!
Im getting strong whaman vibes
my big issue with the trailer was when the lines of   why do you want to be a hunter   is answered by the plucky little protagonist with   because you all tell me I cant. which is then followed by the plucky little idiot attacking a bear. way to prove everyone else right. she s actually put the tribe in danger. because if a giant sky God hadn t killed the bear she would have taught this apex predator how tasty humans are. its also the apparent idea that her whole tribe of hunters cant outwit a predator  but she can  why  dutch won where his squad lost because he stopped trying to outgun   out strong guy the predator. danny glover won in the sequel because he was just massively hard headed  moreso than anyone else in the movie. what does she have that her tribe doesnt  maybe that will get revealed. but Im not holding my breath.a good plotline would be her being told to follow the old ways  wait to hunt  she doesnt because she thinks she knows it all  she doesnt   is saved by a sky ghost. who then kills someone close to her in the tribe. she learns. or maybe gives up hunting. then her tribe is killed off one by one. she now embraces the elder wisdom  but adds some small but of herself to it. knowing things are changing. she triumphs.
the thing that I have an issue with is the  look  at the very least seems to be ripped from the predator fan movie  and if its similar to the fan movie  then obviously its lazy  but I could be wrong  I hope Im wrong because I love the predator franchise including the comics.
youre a real one
first!!!
it looks fun but since hulu isn t in norway and if it dosen t come to movie theaters Im skipping it. and the sandman is out on netflix same day
predator was the best one hands down
for hulu I think its cool
the trailer was far better than I thought it would be. I thought this movie wouldn t work. I could be wrong.
legit reaction
other than the original predator  it looks better than the other predator movies.
imagine getting saved just to be hunted by the thing thatsaved you. he clearly doesnt understand how the concept of saving works.
for what I see   itseem the movie have lower budget and these trailer only show most of it big budget scene  that maybe why its not go to theater.still should be fun to watch
amber midthunder was great in legion  trailer looks good.
to be clear prey predator started as a fanmade movie. its on youtube or it was not sure if its still up and rather or not they got credit.
from what I seen I think people are taking issue with the attitude of the main character towards man  like the dialogue part in the trailer  why do you want to hunt   which she replied  because you think I cant!  and the part she said  Im trying to save you   perpetuating the trope women can do everything and have no flaws  they are just held down by men  I think if she replied something like   because I want to help!  or  because I think Im ready can do it  and I think people wouldn t take too much issue with it  I didn t watched the trailer  but its what I see people talking about.fun fact  the way the predator kills the bear is a clear reference to metal gear when grey fox kills the soldiers in mgs1.
I think the problem most people have with it is how it looks like they re going to rewrite history when generally speaking women weren t hunters or warriors back then. it looks like they re going to have the trained hunter warrior men fail just so the woman can succeed. this can work out just fine if they dont try to preach through their writing and simply focus on making it entertaining  but we re rarely this lucky lol older girl power movies were always fun... girl power movies these days give many of us headaches lolany movie gets a fair consideration from me till I hear reviews from trusted sources.
could be woke yasss queen slay or a decent movie. cant tell
great video today. I like the message  and I agree. youre looking extra cute today. thats all I have to say
I ll watch predator 2 was my fav with danny clover
I think most people dont like it just because it has a female protagonist  which now and days usually means its woke  but I hope they can show a strong female protagonist without tearing down males. and as long as itstays true to the lore like the comments read right after the trailer mentioned  I think it looks good  a lot better than a lot of the more recent predator movies.  hopefully optimistic
call me  cautiously optimistic   like the aliens series  there hasn t been a single good predator movie sans the first two  of course there are some fans who have become incredibly wary and just dismiss prey as another cinematic failure  which is pretty understandable  let s not go into the  woke  nonsense though . based on the trailer alone  itsimply looks refreshing and promising and I really hope this will be the first true good predator movie in years.
predator vs. a deadlest warrior  in any time period minus a gun
doesnt do anything for me. the first film had what I think were an elite team of green beret  correct me if Im wrong  get hunted by one predator  and only one guy survived. the puny girl with a bow and arrow versus a predator with alien tech  not buying the setup.
I no that the predators have been  hunting pirates at 1 point   thats were the pistol came from at the end of predator 2
not to mention that if a native person  even a neolithic one  would be so inferior to an alien predator thatshe would more likely consider it a God and build a shrine in its honour for the tribe to worship forever.
wrong. people know disney is woke so its high alert. nothing about strong females is the problem  its about the story and character.
@eddie brock  so what is wrong with the story and character  it is just a trailer  I cant tell what would be wrong. yeah disney sucks   but as I said if they can make a strong female character that doesnt tear down males whats the problem   ill add itshouldn t be a mary sue either.  but you cant tell any of that from the trailer   has there been more information released about this or are yo just going disney bad
@sparkiet88  there were leaks during production. explaining what her name means and the ideas for the story. I believe this will also be a female predator which breaks another established lore to a degree. it would be different if disney had a positive track record  but the leaks appear to be true that this will be about breaking gender norms rather than story that makes sense.this story was told in the comics using an africantribe. where the hunter was able to defeat the predator with his experience of his land and native animals. no agenda  just story. disney isn t capable of that currently.
@eddie brock  looking at online wikis there is a lot of lore about female hunters  not as common as males but they are still there  and this is from comics from like the 90s not recent stuff  and the females have always been described and depicted as stronger than the males  this isn t new lore. so what are the leaks you dont really say  just that it is female centered  what does her name mean  what do the leaks say about the story  if it is the same story as the comics  which it doesnt have to be since most predator stories are about the same anyway  what is wrong about movie moving it to north american natives  I dont get what you actually think is wrong here  you just keep coming back to disney bad  which in and of itself is not enough of a reason to hate a movie just based off a trailer
@sparkiet88  lol. I dont need wikis. I have the collection. I didn t say it was new lore. listen  if you want to defend groomer disney by all means. Im not going to continue to argue with you when you ve clearly made up your mind and your a casual with this franchise.dont be a b  @  and act like people dont like female characters. they just have to make sense.
@eddie brock  you still havn t given a reason beyond disney bad. I asked specific questions hoping you would help me understand    you have clearly ignored where I specificly said I dont want to defend disney   but im looking at this movie specifically .... what is wrong
@sparkiet88  the specific would be more in line with  solo female human defeats predator in melee combat...I do not say this will happen  but if they should opt to do this  it would be extremely far fetched. I think that is the main reason people allready rool their eyes.you are right in the regard that we nay-sayers do not have facts. but we can make an educated guess at what could happen  as we do have empirical evidence of how it usually goes.dont get me wrong  I do like the ip. and I would be happy if finally after predator and predator 2 we would get a good predator movie again  the others were from meh to terrible .
@markus gutjahr  I agree  thats kinda the point of the op. but this in and of itself I dont see as a problem   ripley figured out a way to kill a xenomorph I know she was in the mech suit. its about how they do it not just that they do it.
people forget the year was 1719 even the predator had somewhat of primitive tech compared to the other predators.
historians hate it because of the multiple inaccuracies seen including the guns used and the complete lack of understanding native american history. the big problem Ive herd from others is the girls line on being a warrior  it just doesnt sit well with everything going on in the msheu. the other problem came from the first trailer with the technology being used against such a primitive culture  the second trailer has helped as well as the director doing an interview  at least for me. Im also predicting we are all going to watch just to see even with all that.
why wouldn t the predators update their masks
I really like that you dont blindly follow the church s traditional teachings on hell. Imyself hope that God can even save sinners once they go to hell. there are some verses thatsupport that  like Jesus ministering to the people who died in the flood. oh  and I vote for youreacting to the resident evil trailer in your next video as Im more interested in that.
Jesus is mentioned in the  predators engineers   aliens - complete timeline  youtube  about 2 minutes in.
Im sure there will be things to nitpick by the diehard fans of the series  but it looks decent.  as long as they dont somehow turn it woke  I ll at least be watching the pilot.  I just kind of wish they d stop painting the predators as the bad guys.
for now predator 2 hasnt been surpassed for me yet.
on the outside  prey looks really cool. the shot with the bear is fantastic. design is looking good with the bone mask and shield thing.the woke in prey is at least a bit more subtle than  say  the force is female etc  but it is definitely there. a young commanche woman just isn t going to be a strong hunter. that is not to say  of course  thatshe couldn t be a good hunter  but basically every single man in the tribe is going to be better. predators hunt for the thrill  finding the best  most dangerous targets they can. so we put 2 and 2 together  we get 4  the star of this movie should be male.  mr. crocker   but in a world where gender is a societal construct  2 2 5   and wahmen are the greater threat! also there is undoubtedly going to be a  america bad for stealing native land  message. probably going to have the yautja turn its focus to the americans   which  considering their firepower  would make sense  and fight side by side the incredible commanche warrior  again  it could be swayed because of the one-sided fight  because she s so cool and brave and honorable  and there it is .
hello  mel  do you like the old tv show alf
I dont think the technology argument is valid at all.in the first predator film  it wasn t the state of the art weaponry of dutch and his team that killed the predator. in fact  they depleted all of their ammunition against it to no avail.what ended the predator was primitive weapons  like bows and arrows  and dead drop traps. but above all it was dutch s determination and ingenuity  using the information he had gathered at the cost of many of his men s lives to gain the upper hand.if dutch could defeat the predator this way  then surely it is within the realms of possibility that native american characters who were taught since childbirth to live off the land and thrive in a wild and untamed enviroment to put their skills to good use while fighting it.
Im not saying I have a problem with it. in fact  it might be an ok movie for the kind of movie it is  not one of my preferred genres . however  I think some of the backlash could be because the story line seems to involve a female character defying her culture s gender norms and being a mary sue. that is unless the story provides some explanation for her skill set. its hard to tell from the trailer. but considering the movies and shows that have come out in the past decade I can see why some people would see this as another installment mary sue saves the world. this could be wrong  but I can see why some people might expect that to be what s happening.
idk  predator movie looks like it ll be doa.
you shouldn t feel apologetic for having a different opinion then your peers  especially in something as simple as a movie   if they respect you they will accept it   and if they dont   they weren t really your friends to begin with and you lose nothing by losing them. there is no point in leaving one ideological group that dont let you be authentic just to fall for another   and I think that is why so many of us feel an  overcompensation  incoming  because in reality there are among us people who are just as extreme as the woke they just dont align with the woke s narrative. and that kind of make me afraid  that one day the people that fight with us against censorship  against the narrative  will be the ones bending over backwards and censoring us  Imean isn t this exactly what is happening to the woke  shouldn t we learn from their mistakes      ps   I am not saying this to start an argument  I just think we need stay self aware.
sorry silly Imissed street fighter enough to care but alien vs predator is very new. btw the street fighter pinball game just gave free plays like nothing
it better not be the predator all over again  hopefully they learned their lesson  otherwise I am gonna not bother with any new additions to this franchise
I think the trailer looks good but let s be honest  a predator showing up in that time of human history would wipe them all out without much effort. it would be a fight he wouldn t even be interested in whatsoever. these beings are bred to hunt  they want the toughest enemies they can find. because of the huge technological gap and the predators superior physical strength  probably intellect as well   this would be an annihilation plain and simple.
I think it looks fun
thank you melonie for showing thetrailer of the prequel to predator.I absolutely loved the 1st predator movie.Im definitely going to see this.takecare melonie
this ain t it chief  it looks woke to me. I ll pass on it
those who died before Christ were ministered the gospel before his resurrection.after the resurrection  that is no longer the case. we now live according to the parable of lazarus and the rich man  luke 16 19-31 .there s nothing in scripture that alludes to any redemption after death without his blood covering us.
@joshua jackson  what I hope for is Jesus allowing his blood to cover those already in hell if they confess and accept him as their savior. Ive heard that the parable of lazarus and the rich man was a story that Jesus was referring to  and he was reversing the roles of the parable to make a point. there s also the verse about Jesus being the savior of all  and the one about every knee bowing. people add things to those verses  saying that when they say every knee will bow they mean some people will be forced to bow  and when Jesus is the savior of all that means only the Christians. to me  all the verses about hell  the ones thatseem like people will be burning forever  the ones thatseem like people will be killed  and the ones about Jesus saving everyone  just makes me think that we really dont know what hell is like exactly at the end of the day  and I hope for the best case scenario for those in it.
@sygos  thats a hope you can have but there is no scripture to back that up. did you hear about the parable or did youread it  it makes it quite clear that the rich man could not help his family that was alive and they had the prophets and the law. for us that would be Christ because he is the fulfillment of the law.Christ is the savior for all mankind but that doesnt mean we can live contrary  die and experience complete separation from him and say   hey maybe you were right. I ll take that deal now.  if thats the case then where is the justice for living a righteous life the interpretation about every knee shall bow that you gave seems erroneous by whoever said it. the Bible doesnt say every Christian believer knee. every knee will bow due to being in the full majesty of Christ. no one will be able to resist it. not the angels  devils or man.we know enough about what hell will be like because scripture says as much. its described as outer darkness  eternal punishment  judgment etc. where there is weeping and nashing of teeth where the moth and worm do not die.because we re on the internet I want to make it clear that this isn t to brow beat you on this topic  but to clarify. while there are many things we can have open interpretation on  hell isn t one of them.
@joshua jackson  you bring up valid points  and I would ve agreed with you only a few years ago  but since then Ive had experiences which changed my mind. I d discuss this  and the examples you brought up  further  but it would probably take way too much of our time. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me about this as much as you already have  though.
@sygos  yeah its kind of hard to have deep talks like this online. may God bless you and the holy spirit lead you. have a blessed day.
@joshua jackson  you too!
oh I remember that one! ....classic. they dont make em like that anymore
yep cultural appropriation. the thing these kinds of people seethe at. but its okay if they do it and invade someone else s culture and make light of their cultural roles.  Im 100  sure that native american women were completely happy with their roles as gatherers of herbs  farming  harvests  and making clothes. why should they have to over exert themselves or place themselves in danger hunting dangerous game or becoming warriors when they have men that are stronger and faster to do it for them
you apparently haven t seen the first movie  all the modern weaponry did nothing and it was more primitive traps and ingenuity that dispatched the predator to the point that he self destructed
to me  this just seems like one of these movies that are unnecessarily made because we can already infer what will happen  unless a disingenuous  subvert your expectations  is pulled. the predator and alien movies have been using the same formula for years with minor variations with each iteration. this one especially looks like a fan-fic on a big screen. I find it very hard to believe that one sole native american can defeat a predator while also  historically  tribes got wrecked by european settlers. unless Im missing some context in predator frachcise when it comes to history bending  I do not believe my claim is outlandish. even in the trailer  the protagonist seemed to have issues killing a bear. the protagonist simply being woman is not the issue  but I suspect if there were to be any  wokeness   the writers would find ways to make her artificially smarter and stronger compared to the other characters in the movie in a blatant and demeaning manner  similar to what happened to other franchises . I get that this is just a movie and there isn t a need for realism when your brain is turned off to have a good experience. I am just not one of those people in recent times.
honestly  I knows where this will be going  the female character will be outcasted by the males from her tribe  she will never be taken seriously before the massacre starts  she will overpowers all males in her tribe  and  at the end  I swear  she will cut her hair in a woke fashion. I dont expect less from today s enterteinment
some folks are going to automatically yell  woke  just because they see something different. I think this will expand on the ending of predator 2 when one of the predators gave danny glover s character a pistol with  1715  inscribed on it. this film supposedly takes place in 1719 as well. also  throughout cinema we need to think how native peoples from north america have been consistently portrayed as being evil  especially in john wayne movies. God forbid we want to portray indigenous peoples in a positive light.
80s babies 90s kids......holla!
interesting view. its a theft of a fan made movie. Im hard passing on this one.
people acting like predator franchise could be disrespected xd is one of the most b movies ever made  pretending that its high class production wont make itso  homies xd I think prequel looks cool
I liked prey
as much as Im not a stickler to avoiding historical anachronism  I d like to know if whoever this tribe is they had female warriors only cause native people have already had their culture rewritten in modern media way too often    id like to see some more accurate preservation .otherwise the concept looks cool.
this tale was told much better in  predator jungle tales. no agenda.
the fact I have a history degree and cultural anthropology degree with focus on native american history and culture makes me an annoying pain in the ass about anything on thatsubject  also part native american . I cringe at all the historical and cultural mistakes from hollywood especially because they virtue signal and always claim  we wanted this to be accurate and respectful of native american culture  bs. almost nothing from hollywood on the subject ever satisfies me because of all the easily fixed errors typical  best I have seen is the wonderful movie wind river but I also understand the native americans of that reservations complaints about that film. there are too many errors in this story for me to even get into them but on top of that  the idea of a barely armed girl  by today s standards  taking on a predator especially from a highly patriarchal tribe where she almost certainly had no weapon training is just too much for me. I do believe the choice of her as the  hero  is motivated by woke hollywood virtue signalling. the trailer does look cool  I just cannot put all the crapping on historical facts aside. no offense intended to anyone that does like it. I think the concept is cool it is just the way it is done. if they insisted on the hero being a female they should have chosen a less patriarchal tribe say for example one of the iroquois confederacy tribes where it would be more believable that a girl may have had some weapons training  although still unlikely.
I like the concept. I like the director. I think the preview made it look like it could be good. however  I dont like the lead actress. she was in the fx series legion  and was easily the worst part of that amazing show. she has no range  cant emote  and sounds like she is just reading her lines. also  she has a bad habit of just standing there with her mouth open for no reason. its like she saw kristen stewart in the twilight series  and thought   thats the best acting Ive ever seen. I want to be just like her when Im on screen.  hopefully  the director saw some of her other roles and told her   you can be in the movie  but only if you stop being a wooden mouth-breather.
Im getting avatar call backs from this predator trailer and they re not good. how s the native american girl around the middle ages to know about advanced alien weaponry to dodge oncoming plasma fire from the predator s shoulder canon
there is nothing about the trailer that looks objectively bad.  however  it features a woman as the protagonist  and is focused on a group of non-white people  and these kind of things seem to trigger certain reviewers  especially when they feel that their identity owns a franchise.  sometimes hollywood does make a misstep  like with the all female ghostbusters  and just tries to make a movie that has a different representation  without having a plan on how to make a good version of that movie  that has representation  but a lot of times they also get it right.  I am hoping this is one of the times they get it right.  given who the director and producers are  I am willing to strongly hope this is going to be a great movie.
why aren t you on any of the g g game streams  they stream mario kart and fortnite. you d be a perfect addition
so many illogical things and things you have suspend disbelieve.first of  a predator would allways have his mask and usually a plasma caster  to be sure and safe . in addittion appropiate weapons for the prey they hunt. in that time period  he wouldn t even touch the plasma caster  unless he wants to disgrace himself.nevertheless  he would still hunt at least with cloak and his claws. this alone would mean utter destruction of nearly everything at that time. even if he would be unblooded  he would still be experienced enough to outfight every single human being in close combat.there is no point for him to kill the bear. the bear was killed while it was distracted by a third party. it is not an honorable kill. and he wouldn t want to safe her  because altruism doesnt run in their blood  and she allready proved thatshe is the weaker of the two  her and the bear .makes no sense whatsoever.I do think I have to watch it unfold  but I am biased against it because of the times we have the pleasure to be in. of course it could all be perfectly explaine  but I just have my doubts  and those doubts paired with what we have seen so far make me far more critical.
my problem with this movie is she wants to be a warrior.  historically that would have never gone over with the men and women of the tribe.  now women and children were taught on how to defend themselves  but women had defined roles.  however  if the movie was set up where she was a handful of survivors  women and children  then we have a good concept of revenge. the problem with the wokies is that they worship and the church of presentism - uncritical adherence to present-day attitudes  especially the tendency to interpret past events in terms of modern values and concepts.
given the time period this takes place in  that dog should look more like a wolf and less like a dog.
Im guessing people not liking it  would be because the main character thatseems to be the one thats going to kill the predator is a tiny little girl. even if its an honest use of the girl in this situation  the woke movement has ruined it for everyone and made ppl so sick of it.plus its disney  should be reason enough to expect crap  and pg-13 so its already not targeting its core audience.
cool
I was born in 1984  and now Im living in it!!
@                         81! yep those days are long gone. I grew up in the 90s
the tribe its based on didn t have female hunters or fighters so I would make since she would want to prove herself
Imay not be a predator nerd personally  but I recognize a fellow nerd who knows his shit about something  and you  sir  know your shit.
as a fan of most of the predator films  novels  there s one  where a navajo soldier fights one  and comics I say that an old west setting is a fine  fresh idea. thumbs up! the comanche warrior girlboss however is a thumbs down from what Ive read about that tribe.. they were fierce raiders and unforgiving enemies of the whites and the mexicans  and were definitely not early champions of women s rights  because they routinely gang r...ped or abducted and enslaved their victims  no matter the skin color. cynthia ann parker s case is the best example.the apache on the other hand would work fine  they had warrior women like lozen  gouyen and dahteste.
melonie  at 12 09  you talked about hell and what happens there. if you take every mention of hell  death  the grave  gehenna  and every other reference to the subject of death and resurrection  you will get a clear picture of what God says about the fate of humans when we die. I know this is lengthy  but here are the conclusions that I arrived at through researching the subject first  there is a lake of fire  but it isn t used for eternal punishment. eternal punishment is an idea from paganism that was rolled into Christianity under the roman catholics. the lake of fire  gehenna  in the Bible refers to a place of utter destruction. like a modern day incinerator. anything that goes in  comes out as ash and cannot be restored. the purpose of the lake of fire is to represent the absolute end of something  not its eternal punishment.second  there is no purgatory or  souls  waiting to be judged or watching over other people  because the dead dont know  see  or hear anything. jews before and after Christ believe believed that the dead are at rest  not suffering  not thinking  not watching  not doing anything. even before Christ  jews understood that death was no different from sleep until the resurrection. Jesus himself said that lazarus was sleeping. when you are sleeping  you dont know anything about what is going on in the real world and you dont experience anything from the real world until you wake up. some people dream when they sleep  so there is a possibility that the dead might dream  but that is only if death is literally just like sleep rather than figuratively like it   but those dreams dont impact the real world  and in most cases are forgotten the instant you wake up. so  any dreams the dead might have has no impact on anything meaningful.so where are the dead then  the Bible describe the dead as being in hell. but according to most  chirstians    hell  is a punishment for sinners. therefore  hell cannot be a physical or even spiritual place with fire  brimstone  and torture  else everyone who died before the resurrection and everyone awaiting judgement would be in a state of intense suffering and torment until they are judged. so  hell and the lake of fire cannot be the same place  and the dead are mere dead and awaiting judgement  but for them  they aren t waiting hours  days  weeks  or years. just like when you fall asleep at night  and wake up in the morning feeling like no time has past at all  this is the same experience the dead will have. they are alive  they die  and the next thing they know they are being judged for their life.third  since the wages of sin is death  how can eternal torture be justified  the punishment for sin is already death  so it makes no sense that there would be additional punishment on top of that. that would be like having a law thatsays the punishment for going 20 mph over the speed limit is a  150 fine. then having anyone who is caught going that fast pay the fine  and then be branded with a hot iron even thought thats not written anywhere in the law.fourth  anyone s who s name is not written in the lamb s book of life will not have eternal life. the Bible describes God as being the source of all life  and thus anyone cut off from thatsource would cease to exist. this should end all discussion of eternal punishment  as to be punished  you must be alive. those who die without doing what is required to receive eternal life will simply be forgotten by God  and thus not exist anymore. so  for someone to be eternally tortured  God would have to continually provide those individuals with life and keep them in his memory  which would make him an  evil vindictive God   and thus not the God the Bible describes.lastly  we do not have eternal souls  else we would all have eternal life by default. so  in this regard  many atheists are closer to the truth than many  Christians   when they say   when you die  nothing happens. you just stop existing and it is no different than before you were born.  for anyone who s name is not in the book of life  what the atheists say is true  but for those who will be granted eternal life  they wont cease to exist when they die  but will be resurrected  I say  they  and not  we  as I hope to be among that group  but cannot definitively say I am already there . based on all of this  we must conclude that those who die while not in Christ  will simply remain dead forever which is to say they will cease to exist  and those who are in Christ will be revived to everlasting life.
my goodwill has been used up and I dont think this is going to be good from all the ytubers I watched they say the same thing. lets see what the marketing is because when itstarts attacking fans thats it for me. its also pg-13 which is kinda meh for a pred movie because some of the best shots in the original movies were of the predator cleaning the bones of its victims as trophies.
mf ers be putting way too much thought and analysis into this. they re not required to make this historically rigid in regards to comanche civilization nor does she have to be a strong male to defeat a predator as the simple adage of  if it bleeds we can kill it   still applies.
I think the main issues from people like g g etc was that the movie doesnt make sense who is it for   also the entire concept including visuals was ripped off from a 2019 fan film
did we all forget arnold took out the predator with traps and primitive tools   also the predators tech is going to be old and not as advanced. ridley   and sarah conner were bad ass and not woke. it can be done. so give it a chance.
I loved the original haven t been a fan of the sequels this looks entertaining enough there s a ton you could nit pick about but sometimes you just got to go for the ride.
predator  native woman  if an alien came with all that he has  in reality this would be a 30 second movie. alien turns up. woman dies first. men second.
let s be honest  if predator  80s  came out now  it would be pulled apart....these kinds of films are rarely perfect. its a gamble for the studio and as such  they normally interfere  but for the most part  this looks solid and a welcome change. cannot wait to see it.
I heard the predator was supposed to be female.
might be the top gun maverick hype dominating my emotions right now but I have zero interest in this movie. and this is coming from someone who liked the female fighter pilot in top gun maverick. she was just chill. nothing to prove to the other guys. didn t dump on her teammates for being male and didn t have a victimhood mindset of  oh you dont think I can fly like you guys   nope. she just did fighter pilot stuff and was a badass without even bringing up any gender issues.
see  this is the kind of stuff I d like to have seen more of.I dont want minorities to be shoehorned in to replace characters who align more with the majority.I want to see stories depicting the minority characters in their own historical and cultural context.it works for the predator franchise  because it has featured many different protagonists through various points in time. there s nothing saying that dutch is the sole main protagonist. he was the protagonist in the first film and made his harrowing journey. in the second predator film it was an l.a cop. in predators it was a grizzled mercenary and so on.so having a film taking place where the characters fighting against the alien are native americans at an earlier point in history is totally fine. make a point of showcasing some of their history and their culture  outside of the  white man  context.
in native tribes  woman were not warrios   this is a woke red flad  pocahontas may be a disney movie but was historical accurate in their portrait of woman in native americantribes
just so you know the reason why this film is getting alot of hate before its release  is a kneejerk reaction from the ruined franchises over the years  from genderswapped characters to virtue signal woman empowerment movies.  but the people who have seen this film already are giving its deserved praise and stating the trailer doesnt do the films story justice.  the main characters story arc is earnt and makes sense.  dont feel bad for liking the look of this trailer and dont listen to the hate.  its a very small loud minority of extreme  anti-woke  few  who haven t even seen the film yet and are judging it from the way the trailer has been cut.  I want to spoil so much but cant  and all I can say  is this isn t sarah connor from terminator dark fate or cw batwoman.  this is ellen ripley from aliens 1 and 2.  one hint I will give  is the trailer has been cut in a way to show her hunting the bear and failing.  this is not how this scene plays out and this movie has restored my faith in movie franchises with no studio inteference.  the only thing disney intefered with is the marketing trailers and distribution.  you will hear alot of  how can a tiny girl fight a giant alien and win !    thats another clue to spot the incels who are just straight up flaming on the film without actually seeing it.
glover
I think it looks pretty good. I haven t seen the criticisms but I d guess some of it has to do with what appears to be the main character being a woman again. Im no native expert but from what I recall being taught in school  women weren t warriors in a lot of tribes. I dunno  it doesnt bother me. I can see another complaint being related to the predator having a hard time hunting these people from this era. I think thats a lame complaint to have  predators are all about the sport challenge of the hunt  they can   will handicap themselves a bit if it makes it more fun. and just because the humans dont have advanced tech doesnt mean they cant be competent.
this looks a million times better than the predator. Im actually very excited for it. 10 cloverfiel lane was very good and he s a good director of strong female characters.
that trailer was a fn joke
its looks cheap as
in the first predator movie none of the tech and weapons worked. arnold had to resort to primitive tactics and the movie pushed that by showing him abandon modern weapons build wooden traps and smearing mudd on himself. if anything indians have a better chance than arnold when it comes to that.
I doubt that the film will accurately depict the comanche culture in the 18th century.
the predator tech did stagnate. means that they have at that time allready the same tech level as later in predator. tech dosen t matter anyway knowing that even an unblooded predator has allready more experience with far more dangerous things during training than a normal human can hope to have.remember  dutch needed several things to come together and still barely made it out alive. lucky find  that the mud could circumvent the heat vision  which that predator overused. the predator itself being overly confident  and dutch himself. an extremely experienced soldier with heightened physique.
@ucjyxc8tfkqq-lkntqpy66uwin many many horror movies a female is often the protagonist  you dont think it would be fun to see a predator destroy a group of frontiersman with muskets    its predator not some deep master class in filmmaking. people need to relax a bit.
bull  the first film still holds up today  thats why its endured as a classic to this day. the effects are top notch  the writing and pacing are tight  focused  and wastes no time on frivolous shots or ideologies. if youre actually interested in seeing the first film analyzed  look up the videos by mauler and criticsl drinkers after hours.
@jeggson vohees  I am a fan of the 1st film  but like many 80s films  they are a product of their time with their casting and script.I dont care about the stuff that people would pull apart today  because with most films if you want to find falts  you will. so with that in mind  this prey trailer is no better or worse than the arnies predator trailer.  first film I ever snuck into in the 80s what bothers me is when people rip into it before seeing it. comparing it to a beloved 80s film that these days would cause eye rolls with lines like  stick around . Christ  these days I dont even know if they would let them have the pussy jokes in because of  waaaamen I hope for the best as any fan should because if this fails  get ready for a distant pg13 reboot or no films at all.
it would only be pulled apart for being too male.. too masculine. predator is still amazing.
@fourth-1000  today it would be criticised for stereotyping sexism toxic masculinity white male hero as other races are killed jokes about woman bits that are now also men s bits lolI just hope in prey  the lead is written without agenda. strong women roles in sci-fI have two greats to draw upon. ripley and sarah connor.... let us hope they went that path.
@mrmr gaming  lol. they didn t. this movie is woke propaganda as per disney standard.
nope. predator is one of the very few perfect movies. sjw s would no doubt find something to complain about but thats what they do and thats not what you meant.
the first film is might count as woke since itstars  white  african american  native american  hispanic and asian if I remember right.
@darth dank  diversity alone doesnt make a film woke. its a combination of ideas and ideology behind it. if anything the first predator movie proves we were beyond petty politics and racism in the 80s. what changed
@n7 tigger  one of my favs  but its not perfect.....if you know the film well enough. arm fx on show  fixed in later releases  messed up adr  a fair few continuity errors  and factual mistakes. I spotted these in the 80s  but its nitpicking stuff really.
a yautja female...on a hunt even...would be extremely rare. maybe a hish-qu-ten  as they are hermaphrodites.
@mr. sinjin-smyth  true  but going by predator rules  guns are one way to draw a predator to you.
there are quite a few accounts of female warriors in the native tribes. so it doesnt bother me. but still what needs to be remembered is that those women  usually didn t go in with melee. which means the combat prowess stems from bows  rifles and striking while the target is distracted  or striking an opponent who isn t versed in melee at all.it wouldn t make a difference against a predator with claws anyway what gender you are. but...it is implied she will hunt him  and that is where itstarts to get yucky  depending on how they handle it.remember  dutch needed several things to come together and still barely made it out alive. lucky find  that the mud could circumvent the heat vision  that predator overused. the predator itself being overly confident  and dutch himself. an extremely experienced soldier with heightened physique.dutch alone would be  without modern weapons  an out of context problem for that tribe. let alone a predator.
@markus gutjahr  maybe I should have used the term hunter instead of warrior. either way the opening dialogue of the trailer implies this tribe does not typically have females doing either. in any event  I didn t specify  all  but  a lot  of tribes didn t have females fill that role in their society.this seems to be set somewhere in north america during the period of western expansion  as we see some white dudes with rifles briefly. I couldn t get a good read on exactly what area they were in just based on the landscapes shown. if I had to take a shot in the dark guess somewhere between the plains   rockies.you bring up some good points about dutch s prowess  but also remember this  natives all over the continent were doing a very effective job at holding settlers back   waging guerrilla warfare on their terms for a long time over many bloody conflicts... until they weren t any more. I feel like its very plausible that a skilled hunter warrior could take down an overconfident or inexperienced predator in this time period.we ll just have to see how itshakes out  yeah  dont get me wrong  if her win is due to a complete asspull or contrived plot device or something  I wont be too keen on that. let s be fair  its highly unlikely they ll kill her off  but if they pull the old switcheroo   have the predator take the win I d honestly be shocked.
@cd5sircoupe  this movie will feature the commanche tribe  which is extremley patriarchal. so this is a bit of a problem they have to navigate without looking too woke.I agree with you that the native amercantribes bring out excellent warriors  but under no circumstances anyone of those would hold up in knowledge  experience or combat prowess against a special forces soldier of today. there is such a vast amount of time between those two  with all that knowledge they pump it you at the sf schools it isn t even funny. plus  dutch was even amongst them extraordinaire.nevertheless  I dont really want to disagree with you. it can happen  but it needs to be done with a nuanced hand in an intelligent fashion  so not to hit us over the head.
@markus gutjahr  thats good to know. I have like  no knowledge on this prey thing aside from what I saw in the trailer. that clears things up a bit. and fwiw my area was mostly algonquian   iroquois nations  so a bit differentwhile special forces soldiers are extremely well disciplined   effective in combat  they too have been defeated by regular guerrilla fighters in modern times. I guess it just comes down to circumstance   a bit of luck  or lack of  sometimes. you know that thing where people run a simulation of like  1 000 jedI knights vs 10 000 vikings medieval knights whatever  I think this could be a good one to simulate. and totally agree  see my other comment. this needs to conclude in a manner that makes sense   isn t contrived.
I wasn t a fan.  I dont have a problem with the premise.  but I think the acting could be better.
first line of this movie is enouth
arnold beat it with traps of sticks and stones.she can do the same.and what woke  women where the star of terminator and alien.
also  the new resident evil trailer. no. just. no.
looks good  but why do the natives have american accents.
people dont like it because the idea of a 5-foot nothing girl  100 lbs soaking wet  having an equal chance against a predator as dutch arnold schwarzenegger is ridiculous.
I cant say why but I cant stand that actress. I really liked legion too but she s just not believable to me at all as a serious character. her  intense  face is just boggling her eyes and she has no muscle tone or flexibility  all her fight scenes look like the best take they could get taking itslow for her for the fifteenth time. maybe just me but Im shocked to see her land a leading action role.
it looks pretty cheap. hulu was a fit for this.
you are beautiful but you would be more so without the tattoos.
so woke. go broke
it is kind of like why did they use native americans  not that I hate native americans I am part native myself but just saying why that time period.
I think the movie looks cool too  and I know woke culture is bad but so is extreme antiwokeness. strong female characters have always existed  that is why I cant stand modern day feminist who say women are always oppressed. anyways your right melonie woke culture has been dying off lately. people have been finally airing out their grievances and stop spending their money on woke propaganda.
a dislike for the boom part
if you think thats pretty cool.....yea beginning to doubt you.
the predators are  white
this franchise is dead. dont watch it. they re using for nothing more than woke points.
let s be real   fans  who are hating on this movie already because it doesnt have a male lead. they use the  body type  as an excuse to hide them from saying  woke . and ppl saying that a comanche woman in real life wouldn t do that in real life  well news flash its a fictional movie just like the rest. myself as a military person  dutch accurately fires his weapon incorrectly during the whole film. military people dont hold fire weapons like that but hey its a movie. its for fun. you dont see me hating the whole movie  movies in general  for one detail that is incorrect in real life. we should be hoping that its just a good predator movie whether it has a male or female lead. ripely pulled it off in the alien franchise.
I am pretty sure Im being sexist  but this trailer doesnt give me the same amount of interest. I would have preferred a male lead. not some chick who has something to prove  but thats just me. plus Im navajo. to me this seems a bit cheesy. it might be the american accents or the english language. or just everything Imentioned all together. I ll wait until it comes out  and see what my peers say about it. until then  its what  evs. . .
sorry  I cant buy a 110 lbs little girl cantake on a predator that a bodybuilder in arnold schwarzenegger could barely defeat! Im out!
this movie is garbage
thats fair

get to the choppa!!
I figured my giant lara croft collection behind me might be some sort of giveaway that Im not against female leads lol
@melonie mac go boom  most of my favourite chars are female  but come from a time they were properly crafted. plenty of terribly crafted men in recent films too. the fact you said you are not against female leads  like that explains something.....yea. now explain how in this timeframe  when contrasted with the original in which grown men with machine guns and elite training struggled to kill predators  but this woman in a time where women were care givers and given basic training in hunting and not brought to war is now going to be fighting a predator and probably outsmarting it ..... yea. I would question why that is. so this tribe just made an exception to train her because she is super special I guess    it does not look like it will be much and in my region not getting a cinema release. so I doubt who ever made it even have faith. you do you  if you think this looks good. I guess I need a bit more than the straw man of I am not against women leads  therefore Imust like.
@tempered glass  worse  they are commanches  they would never train a woman. every single other tribe would have been better  as they did train women as hunters and warriors.
fans  aren t just critical of the 90 lb girl. its more complicated than that and if disney wasn t pushing identity politics it would be received differently.so maybe you should consider your bias towards  fans  and listen to the criticism.
bias   I have no bias to anything. if its good  its good like the first movie. if its bad  its bad like the last movie. and you literally threw yourself under the bus mentioning the woman s size and weight. thatsounds like sexism to me pal.
@kiryu s havoc  everyone has bias  even you. Im super sexist. so its not an insult. can you do better  even being a sexist  I know she has about as much of a chance of beating a predator as a broken vet can defeat alcoholism.
congratulations!!  you want a cookie
first of  the  fans  thing. dont come over as someone who just refrained from calling us toxic fandom. doesnt belong here. we can discuss like civilized persons.few hate the movie  most are just worried we  long time ip fans  get  again  another crap predator movie.commanche woman is the biggest problem as commanche were extremly patriarchal and didn t allow women to fight or hunt at all. basically every other tribe would have been more realistc  as they indeed had female hunters and warriors.just saying it is fictional doesnt make incoherencies  say the girl kills the predator in a fair melee combat  go away  and there are still realistc rules in place  as it plays out on our planet with our tech and so on. even the predator and his weapons allready have an established baseline.I would be happy with a good movie which has a good  logical story. would be fun. but the track record shows up differently the past years.
but youre ok with 110 lb ripley in the alien movies
@melonie mac go boom  yes  because she didn t overcome the alien with physical strength  she used her mind and outsmarted the creature! then she built up a strong will and resolve in the sequel. I love ellen ripley and sarah conor. their efforts were earned and their characters were just better written. their strength was just more believable. I just get suspicious of modern day hollywood  you know what Imean.
I would also add the bride in kill bill  selene in underworld  and elektra in netflix daredevil. I guess to me female characters were written better in the 80 s  90 s and early 00 s.
@melonie mac go boom  see  the difference is  that you typical predator will kill your typical alien. in melee. ripley would have been shredded in an instant if she would have engaged in melee against an alien.she had her pulse rifle or the power loader. and it was a good story which allowed her to outwit her opposition. ripley made sense.and I dont say the girl in prey wont make sense  but the educational guess for movies in this day and age do worry some. me too.the main problem is the timeframe this is set. in which weak rifles  in comparison to today  and melee  especially in the tribes  are the main weapons. no one  male or female  can even hope to kill a predator in anything which would resemble a fair  open  fight. which means it needs to come down to trickery  which is fine. but that needs to be done intelligently. and there is the doubt....
@markus gutjahr  nicely put  with a lot of details!
I see you dont get the bigger picture of them harming the franchise  anyway at the end of the day youre a woman ...
this is another sjw franchise destroying movie.
no no  no  no. no more of this bullshit. I will never watch another  franchise  movie as long as I live. come up with your own original idea or quit film making. this is so ridiculous at this point.
I agree with move on from pre existing franchises   but its fantasy we can have female action heroes
@sparkiet88  ya that part didn t really jive with the rest so I removed it.
