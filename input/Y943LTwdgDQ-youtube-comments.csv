Ive gotten darker from being outside and I need to adjust my camera  lighting now and get new foundation to match. Im not orange irl no worries
uzaki-chan wants to hang out! was the manga with the short girl with the big boobs. in the story she is in college. and it is literally one of the most wholesome manga out there.
10 45  what is this obsession with making lara ordinary  having a husband etc  immediately made me think of james bond  who often gets criticized for his representation as a shallow womanizer  when  novels aside  just thinking the movies  they actually did make it part of a real character arc of how he ended up like that   he did fall in love with a woman  she ended up getting murdered for her relationship to him  and as a result he refuses to allow himself to ever become committed to any other  bond girls  that he does actually develop feelings for over the course of his work and his travels.  people will complain its shallow but in its own sense there s definitely a way that it makes the character deeper.anyway  it can be part of fleshing out a character more fully.  it can be.  the question is  are you butchering the character  luke skywalker comes to mind  or are you making them more real and understandable
played chrono cross several times back in the ps1 days  with as close as 100  completion as I could  and I didn t remember that character until people pointed it out  lol. minor boss  lower-tier party member  borderline joke character. so harmless Im surprised they spared the manpower to change it.the real trouble here is square enix s  ethics department  slowly but surely creeping in and altering both new and old products. by the time they get to something you care about  its already gonna be too late.
I agree with everything you said.  giving lara a daughter or a husband is totally the opposite of who she is as a character. lara isn t the  settle down  type. she s not an ordinary person. she s extraordinary. this obsession with deconstructing well known characters is concerning.
I haven t watched the video yet  but I can already tell you that nothing should have been censored.
the thing with censorship is that it is really binary  youre either for it or against it. once you make the leap to saying youre against it in general  but this one thing should be okay to censor  you ll have to accommodate pretty much any opinion on what could and should be censored. because everybody has different sensibilities and I d bet there are folks out there who dont make a big deal about the text  but for whom the wardrobe change is a deal breaker. who s to say one opinion should be valued over the other  the only deciding factor  if any  should be the law and the constitution  if its legal  you can show say it . its the closest thing to an overarching societal consensus we have. its flawed  as for example we see in canada with its freedom of speech problems  but its the best guidance tool we have. stray from that  and censorship becomes basically a giant free for all.
for teen lara  16 is age of consent in the uk  and really  most of the world including a third of the us  and its a uk dev team.
I love how you keep calling it your new channel after all this time
chrono cross is one of my favorite games  so Im kind of unhappy about any changes being made due to modern  sensibilities.  I dont care whether the character is  real  or whatever. Ive played the game for over 20 years and it has never even crossed my mind that there was anything sexual about the original model in this case. fortunately  it does seem like this particular change is fairly unimportant. but if they have changed anything substantial  I ll reconsider supporting the project.
its not about people wanting to see the panties  its about not altering the original work  any form of censorship we tolerate will open the door to more stuff getting cut. the same thing happened with mass effect and it will continue to happen if people keep buying the product  so those of us who dont want censorship must refrain from buying these remasters if they are altered.
on the topic of censoring the 9 year old character  I remember playing a game called bravely default and how they had to raise the characters  ages by 3 years for the western release. there were some scenes where the lady characters were  sexualized  by other older characters  but the intention was that the lady characters are seen as adults in that fictional world even though they would have been considered minors over here.
I was inspired to start playing the tomb raider games - specifically now tr anniversary to play as old school lara croft  who s a total badass!    thanks to your passion for the franchise. keep doing what youre doing! Im Christian too  and your daily scriptures and boldness in your faith in God are a huge inspiration. blessings and be well!
congratulations on reaching 30k so quickly. love the content you put out. keep up the good work.
while this is a grey area  censorship always starts out like this. you give them an inch like changing a young character s underwear taste  and they take a mile like changing a gun to a hammer on a springlock  one piece . you have to stamp out any and all instances of this because censorship has no place for a product that isn t meant for a younger  sensitive audience anyway. if the content is questionable  then dont watch play it. there are plenty of other things to do that are age-appropriate without dragging its integrity down.
great video mel I agree with the tomb raider stuff you mentionedI never for cared censorship it ruins everything especially creativity it feels like the  woke  people are ruining everything because they dont like it   they find it offensive back to what you said about opinions when I was growing up I was always told  everyone has their right to their own opinion after all opinions are like a  holes  everyone has one if you dont like someone else s opinion suck it up  deal with   move on its just an opinion  I dont think its right to censor things that dont need to be censored like the text in this game for example when say a million people who originally played it back in the day had no problem with it at all and we have to cater to the group of say 50-100 people who say  change it  we dont like it  now when making a new product they look at the 50-100 people who are offended by everything while trying to please them   loyal fanbase at the same time but here s an expression I learned in life really quick  you cant please everybody  no matter how hard you try
chrono cross is my favorite game of all time. the music  the story  the setting. its so unique and beautiful.
I like the new translation for una  leena s little brother . it always confused me why a little sibling would say that. I think the original had mistranslations  albeit I believe minor  and this change feels much natural. I used to wish my older sisters were nicer. graphics doesnt change how  big  a fan is. I like the new models mostly.  I wish they kept serge s face more roundish. as for  not real  still can represent real common things. generally kids are at certain height at certain ages.
the ethics department strikes again! this will be the downfall of square enix if they keep this up. now you gotta wonder what they will do with laura
this is my first time coming across one of your videos. I really like how you openly express your faith  and even have a Bible verse of the day segment at the end of your video. it really made my day.
sooo  after 5  years of  orange man bad  the wokies can finally go  orange woman bad  too...personally Im looking forward to it... and I ll of course be part of the  racialism is bad  counter-charge
love the tan!
melonie you should try out insurgency sandstorm very good military shooter check that puppy out
your tattoos looks good with the tan
youre trying to be the next starfire  huh  haha. Im joking. you still look good  no worries.
orange woman good  p
@the royal mediator  starfire cosplay  would be based lol !
@apollo patriot  Im here for it!
its alright
her dad is probably my favorite character. either him or ami.
as a guy with a lot of irish in me  I always have to be careful!
orange woman bad!!!
orange woman bad
dont do it. youre not gonna get a smoother look on your cheekbones than you have now. wait for fall.
I want to get this game on ps4 the censorship seems minor but is it worth playing as a port.
completely agreed. played cc so many times as a teen and never even knew they modeled that character that way. and this is coming from someone who thought you could see more of the shower scene in parasite eve 2  I was 13 .
same.  played the game a lot back when it came out and never noticed.  when I saw this I was actually surprised to find out it wasn t edited for western markets at the time.  that line of dialogue though.  that I remember and that they shouldn t change.  the new line totally changes the character
yeah  I dont remember ever noticing as a teenager  then again I didn t really play these characters  I always stuck with glenn and a few others.
real people are not static  either. I prefer to think the  original  tr games covered a specific period in lara s life  where she certainly wasn t interested in romance. but I dont think its out of the question thatshe might have come around eventually--it just wouldn t be the focus of any tr game.
@thagomizer  I think the movie with angelina did how a romance would workout for lara perfectly... in that  it either wouldn t or she has to end up killing her ex. she would just never be able to find the one her passion is tombs. making her settle down would be highly out of character considering classic lara s backstory is she didn t want to be in an arranged marriage because she loves adventure and a partner would simply hold her back.
@thagomizer  lara is basically like black widow lol. they both just would never end up settling down and ultimately their ending would be an epic death on a mission. . uncharted has that ending with settling down that totally not tr.
if lara were to settle down with someone I would expect her ideal partner to be someone who could keep up her who is used to the life and death situations lara goes through almost everyday  the only person that fits the mold is kurtis trent but whether lara fucks or not is another question entirely.  btw I bet her child wouldn t be like lara at all perfering a quiet life instead and that lara would be okay with that being the person she is.
the only thing I turn a blind a eye to when it gets censored is the sexualisation of child characters who are clearly underaged when its very obvious the design choices dont serve the plot at all.  its one thing to have a story or scene about child sex trafficking but its another thing entirely when its just for grown ass adults to gawk at as nothing more then eye candy  we dont need that in our enterainment and itsends a bad message to kids that its okay to think of young girls as nothing more then fresh meat.
@creativewm_personal  here is the thing  I agree with your sensibility and your arguments thatstuff like this shouldn t be produced. but that is precisely the point  its your sensibility  though shared by me in this case . and if you allow a single instance of censorship on the basis of it fitting your sensibilities  then there s nothing that hinders anything to be censored that offends anybody in any which way. because everything is offensive to somebody  and why should your opinion be taken into account and not theirs  thats why I said stance on censorship is binary  either you are for it or against it. there s no pick and chose on individual sensibilities morals opinions alone. even in this very case  I would bet that if you poll 100 people and show them a gradient of images of a character  wearing the same outfits but in various stages of covering revealing  you would get close to 100 answers as to where the point of  over  sexualization is reached.
@theneongentleman  spot on my friend.
people think california is the whole of us.
@pessiopt 9  - that would be a frightening world if it was.
its still new. I will stop calling it new by 6 months or 50k subs  whichever comes first lol
more manly but short and needs people to feel validated
they re one of those companies that will always have people throwing money at them  thats why they do this.
its why I dont want a remaster of the legacy of kain series  I played chrono  cross and beat it but dont remember much about it. I didn t hate it but prefer the chrono trigger.
love your take on lara croft  melonie. I played the first when it came out. the tomb raider world was allways about mysteries around the world with lots of greedy bad guys and girls. lara s only adventures should be fighting them to get the relics first. she s no indiana.keep boomin   mel. God bless.
my ex-girlfriend when I was in the army  was 4 ft 11  and a fellow soldier. strangely  we both look young for our ages  at the time  I was 22 years old  but I could pass for 17. my ex-girlfriend on the other hand  was 19 years old  and strangely looked 5 years younger. by their warped logic  that would make me a groomer.
squares ethics department needs to vanish into the shadowrealm
I think that  just as a rule of thumb  any cosmetic changes or things that could be construed as  censorship  should be disclosed at the time of purchase. this keeps happening and usually it is altering something to fit a modern leftist prude s sense of what s acceptable. while this case is more understandable  itshould have been among the things detailed as being changed  if it wasn t  if only to avoid a predictable refund backlash.
she s not real! she s not real!  well  neither is lara  so why do they have a problem with her looks attitude  after all ... she s not real  either.oh  and btw ... orange looks good on you  lol
this is very sad. I loved the original chrono cross and bought this remaster expecting just a crisper version of the classic.the game has performance issue which is bad  but I didn t know there was also censorship in it as well. what has happened to square enix lately. they ve been compromised and poisoned by western prudishness.
I wouldn t mind a toxic love for lara in the vein of geralt and yennefer. it could honestly be a great story arc if a character steals an artifact right before she can get to it and she has to track him down. tension  competition and attraction. instead of settling down  it would be periodic chance encounters while both characters seek to remain unattached.
for chrono cross  Im happy they still give us the option for og sprites - which is something I wish the final fantasy pixel remasters did  outside the mod community . Im not in favor of censorship  especially neutering older media for modern sensibilities. its like the world wants more violence yet everyone has to be a prude. same thing with lara croft. too often modern writers want to completely change a character to match their story instead of modifying their story based on what the character will do. its a sign of bad writing. just want to say I love your passion for Christ and your verse of the day at the end of your videos. keep it going and happy easter.
my favorite line from the first movie and a lady should be modest.  yes a lady should be modest.
so the censorship on the character models in chrono cross are only kinda pseudo censored in this case  as you can just revert the models back to classic mode and you d get what they originally looked like  upskirt and all. though I completely agree with you on preferring the new remake models. not only are they sharper and much higher rez  but yeah having a flagrant panty shot on a 9 year old  make believe or not  is not really something Im into. lol
going by screenshots  they also completely removed the accent of one of the characters...being that unique accents for each character is one of the defining traits of chrono cross  thats a much bigger deal than underwear.
the only changes I would accept in a remaster is cleaning up mistranslations and bugs. any kind of altering the character models or completely changing dialogue  no matter how small  is an auto nope from me.
honest question here  anyone that first heard about this remaster think to themselves  they better edit marcy s model to hide her undies or else Im not going to buy the game and give it a 0 10!!! its just completely unnecessary. this censorship just does nothing but bring attention to the fact that is a censorship.
its complicated for under age fictional characters because they have to censor in some instances because there are various countries states they could get in legal trouble for in current year if they leave it in the remaster.
I agree with your take on lara.  her character is for others to aspire to  not to relate to.
I think you could do something interesting with lara settling down and having kids. but in a twist on the trope you make her basically become her father. she abandons her husband and daughter to go off adventuring. she has a family because she thinks thats what youre supposed to do. but then she cant stand life in the suburbs and she just bounces. now she has to deal with the guilt.maybe her actions lead to her family being put in danger and afterwards  when she tries to reconnect with them  they dont want anything to do with her. now she has to deal with regret.but of course these woke clowns are not going to have a good man betrayed by a selfish woman. or a daughter who is super protective of her father and resents her mother.
censorship is always a mixed bag when it comes to reviews. because youre taking something people love and youre changing it  at that point it ceases to be the thing they once loved.
congratulations to you for the quick achievement. keep up your content and keep the spirit
love your channel. in today s society reading scriptures means youre a bada   rebel
my roommate grabbed chrono cross day 1  played for a bit  and realized they included cheats  so he stopped playing. that was all the review I needed to no longer want it.another time  he got picked up to do some voice acting in a fan film  and before the recording even got underway  he said in the company s discord channel that he didn t like undertale enough to keep playing  and that pissed someone off  so they got him kicked off the project.
many are more caught up on how bad it rund on pc.
yeah I did not know either which is precisely the reason why I will opt from getting it. I will continue to play it in my emulator thank you very much lol.
next time  pirate. square-enix is long past their glory days and dont respect it at all so dont pay them for it. I expect them to ruin live-a-live and front mission too but luckily the snes roms are easy to get with proper translation patches to boot.
@nukea6  square has lost their God hood status they are a shadow of their former selves back when they were just squaresoft. then enix came in. I also gotta play front mission sometime I actually have the game for my emulator just have not gotten round to playing it fully yet
@naglfar94   yeah  they ve been going downhill since squaresoft merged with enix but they still had some hits. but they want to commitseppuku with their stupid ethics department  I ll buy their games in a 100  off sale.
exactly what Im saying
agreed
same I hate censorship with a passion
the opposite also the same. anyone that first heard about this remaster think to themselves  they better not censor marcy s model undies or else Im not going to buy the game and give it a 0 10!!!  its just people whining about anything and everything. these whiner also do the same with ffviiI siren and even spiderman ps4 puddle.
Imean  the cheats are optional.... have you tried  perhaps  not using them
@allen bocephus  his reasoning was  they re there  why wouldn t I use them   my rationale was  I didn t really enjoy the game when it first came out  so I would absolutely be using the cheats.
the way you describe lara  she just sounds like a female version of wario. selfish  narcissistic  slightly psycho  independent  toxically hypermasculine  asexual metasexual  a thrill and treasure junky and then things went downhill when they gave him friends. lara croft was always just wario and Im all for a crossover.actually  they would make a perfect couple in the sense it would be so dysfunctional it would become functional and they could also have treasure hunting dates.
while I basically agree with your take on the wardrobe in a vacuum and on a common sense level  I can  not in our current day and climate when seeing who is in charge these days  because even though this change might be small and reasonable for now  we know it will not stop there and will got further in future projects to a level we are no longer ok with when its too late.this is just to put in the first goalpost  ready to move it further down  maybe arriving at a stage like the new mk games  where they completely dressed up the  adult  female characters because its  unrealistic  to show so much skin in a battle scenario  while the male characters were stilling running around shirtless in a lot of cases  because let s be real  these changes are always one sided .its like with microtransactions. they also started relatively small and harmless and look at where we are now because people in the past didn t put their foot down hard enough when it mattered.today sadly you cant be reasonable  but have to be partisan with this kind of stuff nowadays  because the people in charge will make youregret it later down the line if you aren t.
you said the word  lollI   and chills ran down my spine.
Im curious  what would you imagine lara croft doing as she becomes too old to raid tombs  some version of the  teacher  trope  creating adventures for the next generation  or just finding another interesting passion
your deep dive is bringing so much light to what would otherwise be mostly harmless if it were to just be left alone.  the censorship I believe is stupid.  you are bringing websites that fully shine light on both original which if controversial anyhow are far far more controversal now than they ever were or could have been if things were simply left alone.  the feeling is meant to be passive  people aren t really supposed to dissect every pixel.  but people love to be judges of things not of their own creation.
damn melaonie you scared me for a minute lol chrono cross has been my all time favorite game since I was I think 9 or 10 around there when it was released. my cousin got me into it and I thought they censored something huge which would have pissed me off bcuz I just bought it too lol anyways God bless take care love your channel you rock
melonie old physical media is key for videogames
the change with marcy might ve be a cero issue. they ve been cracking down on panty shots lately. also  Im pretty sure that was censored in the western ps1 version as well.
just found your channel last night by accident. glad I did tho! after watching for 2 minutes I instantly subbed. keep up the great content. btw  Im a non-woke democrat but I appreciate all common sense perspectives.
just found your channel. the moment you said wokies I liked and subscribed. loved the opinions and the video
I played a little bit of one of the chrono games for ps back in the day but I dont know which one. I wouldn t complain about originality  etc. if they slipped a visual censor or just redrew the dress over the  mild  exposure seeming shot. the word censoring on purpose but not the visual censoring sort of spells out the lack of integrity in mainstream media these days. killing colorful detailed dialogue but not addressing the  lolI  thing is the opposite direction western media should be headed in. good overview.
been really enjoying this content its funny I just was thinking about getting a video today and here it is keep dropping great content and speaking your mind
they will probably go the route of lara motivating another young spirit to follow in her footsteps. so original  ...
I think as a general rule of thumb is that they re cartoon characters.  they re not real girls and they never will be.  its pixels on a screen and nothing more.  the dialogue and skin change  however  is gauche.  I have a big problem with them changing dialogue any kind  except in the cases of the former being bad translations becoming good translations i.e. language barriers that we used to have.  for specific examples  anything the canadians dubbed in the 80s and 90s - that was bad translations and outright rewrites of the dialogue and story  which left a lot of us confused on what the actual story was.
I played chrono cross for hours and hours during my childhood  its one of my favorite games  and I never saw that pantie  Im not happy with the censorship in the dialogue  but they give the chance to choose between the original and new characters design at least.
tomb raider chronicles or last revelations was on I played on dreamcast and I remember playing young lara croft in a tutorial section though I dont remember a changing scene.  also I d agree changing some angles so less scandalous scene would be a good thing yeah I said it  but changing a character s attire just because the underwear aren t shorts I find odd in my opinion .  though if the original character was portrayed as a minor wearing risqu  underwear then changing that to be like a solid fabric instead of see through material I can completely agree with as a change.  great verse of the day for palm sunday
the thing with this kind of censorship is  you are arguing about people who want to give real people rights to fictional characters. slippery slope argument sure  but I have seen this kind of concession devolve into games being  murder simulators  and an argument for censoring violence. you can never give people who want so censor things a foot in the door because it never ends.
you have the sweetest  most devilish laugh. love it  and love your channel!
also agreed  the prepubescent cartoon sexualization is extremely gross and needs to be as marginalized as possible. when I was in the air force Imet a dude that was really into that crap and never spoke to him again.
the thing about censorship is you give an inch  they ll take a mile. yeah its a bad look for that underage character so you okay that. there will always be rational arguments for censorship. doesnt make it right.
first!!!
@                         ha I just realized that
thank you so much
last revelation s tutorial section isn t what Im referring to. its a tomb raider chronicles scene.
this was one of the square enix remastered games I was looking forward to.
I like how you call woke people  wokies.  it reminds me of wookies  which is a more pleasant thing to think about than people acting woke.   thank you for the verse of the day and reminding us thatsometimes things we dont want to go through can actually be good for us. today I was frustrated that I wasn t reaching my goals as fast as I wanted to  but God told me that he was slowing me down on purpose  and youreading that verse was a confirmation for me! also  I agree with you about censoring thatscene in tomb raider chronicles  and lolI stuff as well .
I hate censorship and refuse to pay for games thatstudios pander to it. its been ruining so many of my jrpgs  where Ive even jumped to getting them on switch with the performance issues.the little kids being censored I can be ok with. much like in the fairy tale rpg where they made wendy s dress all black underneath. it bothered me when they censored lucy post launch
Im told I look young for my age. Im 33 and one day when I was buying some rum  the cashier lady asked if I was old enough to drink and I told her my age. she was genuinely suprised  appearances can be deceiving.
to be honest I wont mind seeing lara having a daughter for her to be lara s kid companion to bring on adventures. like say how the first lou and God of war has done with having a duo of a parent and child. I do agree with users who point out lara isn t really a girl to settle down. but there are family s who travel together that dont settle down at one place so itshouldn t be a bad thing for her to find love and have a kid who she could raise to be like her or maybe have a story we re she tried settling down but adventure and saving the world needed more attention so she left the family to protect them and sometime later her daughter would join her but their relationship as mother and daughter will be a challenge between them since the daughter doesnt like lara croft for leaving her. it would be cool to see
guess I wait for a dialogue patch and sale then. btw I wouldn t mind having lara get a happy ending maybe not in my game but it would add to a bit of character developement  maybe even inspire a sequel. folks cant stay 20-year old and those who do surprisingly aren t usually the happiest kind of people.
Ive never heard of this game but I agree its funnier the first way
the joke is shes calling her sister a horse... from her point of view like a wild animal - everyone can relate to it. thats called immersion   realness. for the time it wasnt yet a trend to wear shorts underneath and it tends to be helicopter parents who over think it. bring back original kmart undies and out of context jokes !!!
can we just let lara adventure and just not worry about anything else. omg. why do we have to overthink everything these days. these people need to stop ruining our media
gaming censorship seems to be rolling around. martha is dead went through a bit of it on ps4. and even the re-release of bandaI namco s pac-land got edited  with ms. pac-man replaced by...pac-mom  a little too precautious there. I think they re just trying to avoid controversy.
the best part is I didn t remember there being any panty shots till this was brought up. I was more pissed at the less than 30 fps in the so-called remaster and how the cutscenes looks like they are in 144 resolution.
haven t played my copy yet did they do a goods job  I loved the original and remember playing the demo at walmart back when it came out
almost read  chrono trigger remaster  and absolutely lost my marbles. now I ll proceed to calmly pick them up again
shut up  she s not real. okay  but its still weird though
there s a difference between being based  which is what you were doing  with reason and logic with some things being too much when something seems off and you dont agree with it because said person seems to be too young or depicted as such through the age being given  and being woke  caving into a narrative because you have to agree with group think to be morally superior or think your group knows all .as for lara not being married or settling down  idk  to me there s a point when I believe someone can feel accomplished enough to want to settle down and the franchise has been around for quite some time and passing the torch for something new and refreshing isn t a bad thing. I respect your take on it though as they re trying to do that to my favorite franchise of splinter cell. now they re trying to pass off the torch to his daughter sarah iirc. I wouldn t mind itso much if it didn t come off as virtue signalling for feminism as she was never into the spy business in the original story. basically while it d be refreshing  I think it has to be done correctly and I think the same is true for lara. given how bad they ve messed up her story there s only 1 of 2 ways it could go. it could be better so that they re not ruining the original while being able to take things in a different direction leaving the original true to herself  or worse in terms of driving it into a new narrative of wokeness further ruining the already dying franchise  though I have hopes that it can be preserved if given to the right people  but I wont hold my breath .
yup just as I feared  saw this remaster  got excited but first decided to look for  chrono cross censorship  as we all know the times we live in and sure enough... sad.
I knew something was up lol. I noticed the skin tones instantly but I was a bit puzzled at her exact words.I played c.c many times and I figured it was off someway.
the censorship is because of square enix s ethics department  whose only purpose is to mandate changes to games in order to make them more woke. this is going to affect all of their future releases. Im not even sure about waiting for ff7 remake pt.2 since they changed so much in pt.1  with tifa s bust size being the least egregious change.
I d imagine they removed  break her in  due to its sexual connotations...
just saw the game. I figured I d look to see if there was censorship before buying it. then your video came out! I ll just play the original with fan hacks.
the real question is are there woke wookies
I do not agree with the censoring part even tomb raider and I dont even play tomb raider however I played chrono cross and it is disappointing it was censored both in story content dialogues and the models. censorship is very disrespectful to the art and the artist and freedom of expression should be valued you can dislike it a piece but dont go censoring it. I will forever have a distatse for censoring. atleast they were smart enough to include a classic mode but I will just play the game emulated did the 1st time not long ago and will continue to do so because of the censorship I will nope on that.
slow progress is still progress.
@mark d  there will be. there will be.
lara  lucca s mom
cc lacks a pc port  so this version has merit given the sharpened texrures  the higher resolution music  and the shorter loading times. cc on psx struggled  more than the previous ff games when loading the battle engine  even more than the original parasite eve. one changed  minor  character model aside  this version is much better than people keep saying.
@paris smith  I like the changes youre saying  but I also have to take a firm stance against censorship of any kind. emulator  the originals  and fan hacks make the game more than enjoyable and playable without giving money to these companies.
@philthestampede  I understand. if the cc remaster was done in unity  it might eventually become the definitive version as we can roll back whatever changes we dont personally like. this is also the first time english speakers get to try radical dreamers though  which comes included.
good thing I grabbed the original a while back.
we love your content
the translation is a common problem nowadays  and it has zero reason to be a thing apart from woke clowns trying to force their mindset and  re-write history  because they think its problematic. as for the panty shot  I dont see the big deal cuz its a fictional character in an anime style where all the characters look young regardless  but im sure twitter would go around using the p word despite that logic. personally  I want a remaster like this to be as close to the original as possible  regardless of current western sensibilities as that is a very slippery slope  as we ve seen in recent times .
I want to see a lara croft   dora the explorer crossover. you know you want to.
they are remastering chrono cross  that was one of my favourite games of all time!
if lara got a daughter  itshould be because a villain cloned her.
been playin  the remaster  I haven t played the game since I was in high school.
what was the anime  the ones that come to mind for me are gravitation and loveless  saw that in manga form and my friends were into it in high school. it was super creepy .
tentacle pron and lollI  two prime reasons why the 2nd big boom was too much
localization in translation is getting out of control.  more and more the original intent of the language is being changed  and thats actually ending up changing the personality of the characters  so then youre subverting the original intent of the creators.  chrono cross remaster is getting mixed reviews on steam.  the censoring and dialogue changes are being mentioned  but more often people are ticked off that it is such a bad port.  I liked this comment -  this port plays like a scratchy ps1 disc.   which is bad for something coming out in 2022.  the censorship changes are being noted in some reviews  but when youre getting 12fps and its still dropping frames  you would want that fixed first.
this is the reason why I started learning japanese  I hate it when translators insert their own agenda in the translations. itstarted when they messed with the yakuza 0 translations.
whatever happened to that french guy who was converting tr2 into unreal 4  now thats how to do a remaster.
I get thatshe s little but accepting censorship sometimes but not elsewhere just opens the door for more sadly
they got chrono triggered
I am so glad I got access to the original and even got the rom for the fan-translated radical dreamers. square-enix can go crash and burn for all I care.
its weird how women are so encouraged by sjws to be hyper-sexualized in real life and yet if they are in video games or anything its literally the most horrific thing ever. melonie rocks!
thank God I have the original
I believe there was some fan fic where lara got a boyfriend. I recall it was called womb raider.
hey melonie lara croft doesnt go home alone she has a butler who she locks in the freezer. showing her true psychopathic nature
oh  man. I thought thatscripture was a repeat  but you had it on your ig stories.
I came from fakebook. the ones complaining on why the sudden censorship got labeled as the p word over a fictional character.
its out digitally on switch  with a physical version from play-asia shipping on the 28th. I think the haters got it wrong too  because everything Ive seen looks like an improvement. this is one of the few times  maybe the only time  where somebody censored something and I didn t care at all.
I was walking a rounf town taking to people in termina and poof I crashed for no reason. they say its eating up a lot of ram and v ram for no reason.
problem in this case is that even the japanese version has the text changed  because this was changed on the root  and not just from a localization group.
@lethos1000  if thats the case then its fine  doesnt change the fact that I had to learn japanese and korean because of the translators. anyhoo  thank you for the info and have a great day.
there should be a classic mode for texts as well. thats a pity  I was pretty interested on getting it for the ps4.
I dont care about the bloomers. I care about the skin tone changes and changing the dialogue
raiding tombs is all I want from lara!!! that is all!
10 45 regarding tomb raider..... her father was similar and she was born. I can see lara getting pregnant but she d probably give the baby up for adoption and leave her mate.
another reason Im glad I have the physical of the ps1 version
I cant imagine lara croft in a relationship  but I cantotally see her using a man when convenient.  like  taking a rando home from the bar  and kicking him out first thing in the morning while throwing a crumpled up 20 at him to buy himself breakfast.
its crazy how they do the remake games its like resident evil 4 vr they cut out when ashley said to leon if you want to do some overtime and leon hitting on ingrid hunnigan like thatshit is stupid they cut that out
blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! peace in heaven and glory to the highest!  -luke 19 38happy palm sunday  melonie mac! God bless!
I d like to nominate elon musk for square enix s ethics department. either that  or I d show them myself that  ethics department  does not mean  morality police.
the short thing is wired since the average height for japanese women is around 5-2 and those below that isn t uncommon
censorship  eh  thats not new thing in most ps4 games. thats sony s  policy  ever since 2020.I remember similar riot regarding censorship about new senran kagura game so that they even said  why release on ps4 and instead not just switch   even the creator kenichiro takakI left marvelous related to that issue.
understandable   and that is how art dies....
17 20 why should anyone expect the main character of a series named  tomb raider  to be a pure hearted hero
wow -- the new detective conan   one truth series update must be super dark!
instead of a daughter I d rather see an old lara as a mentor training an apprentice.
with regards to the character being only 9 years old  you just know that they d do the same thing if she was 29. I despise censorship. when we first heard about the camera angle changes for miranda s rear in mass effect 2  I knew that they wouldn t stop there. they also tamed down the dialogue which was mostly linked to renegade actions  so in the original me2 sheppard said something along the lines of   get to the damned shuttles!! I ll haul joker s crippled ass out of here . its now been replaced with a  less offensive  line.give these cultural vandals an inch and they ll take a mile and then some.
they way you described lara makes itsounds like she has adhd
lara should settle down  become a crazy cat woman who passes the tourch onto someone else.
emotional damage! btw... rory mercury from gate is a lolI  but she s over 900 years old.
God  how depressed would lara croft be if she became a common housefrau with a karen haircut driving her spoiled ass tweens back and fourth from dance practice in her grocery getting minivan  Imight open my wrists for her. oof.
same. the problem I have with censorship is that it always starts out small. eventually it will be too late to realize the mistake of it. first its character design  next its speech  then what  events  now you cant have any premise with complicated  nuanced  or what they call  problematic  in a setting unless its what these prudes greenlight. gives me the vibes of  there is no war in ba sing se.  also I didn t even see anything sexual with it back then. now people are pointing it out and I still dont now but made me realize a lot of people probably need help.
why does the original look better side by side
17 33 amen to that!!
go sign the final fantasy tactics remaster petition to get it halted or cancelled. they are planning to censor it as well and also cut some of the story out. you can blame square enix s ethics department  they actually called these games toxic.
not everyone needs to be a hero.  I agree.  han shot first.
I loved chrono cross back in the day. from what I remember it had a pretty distinct soundtrack. shame about the censorship with that line. although I think the sjws they were trying to appease would probably be more offended by the  break her in bit . I hate lollI stuff. itseems like a satanic way of trying to sexually confuse  screw up people. chrono cross has a big roster and I dont even remember that character. plot involving the characters is also generally limited.
the reason is simple  its cultural. in most parts of the world  16  is the age of consent with different standards of what is being considerd to much  this includes most of europe  though debate has began again . considering the o.g. dev team was british and it originally being an british ip it explains the scene. growing up in europe I dont remember anything else than  the us  always taking issue with lara croft tomb raider and so many other european ip s  like fable . since us censorship pretty mutch always has been the  perceived and often hypocritical  standard for any form of nudity  graphic violence and use of profanity in european ip s  I was under the impression this scene was censored for the us release. cause I do remember there always were differences between european vs us game releases  and my cousins in the us always asking me to pick up and send them european copies of various game who were censored in the us. as a teenager I worked in a game store in amsterdam  and during the first weeks of the release of a  controversial  game  we never had enough  re stock. due to americantourist always buying everything. at some point it got that  bad   that we kept some stock separate to be able to serve our  longterm  local customers during game and movie dvd release periods. under boob or no under boob  I prefer ip s like lara croft tomb raider and fable always to be made by british dev teams. due to their culture and humor being key pilars for the characters and the franchises. as for the japanese character  I simply dont know enough about the ip  so I take your word for it that your correct about her age. and thus agree with her being changed  though im of the opinon ensorship always is a slippery slope due to cultural differences. and has to be approached individually per character ip.
time to tomb raider reference  3 36
im with you..
I think this video illustrates why I wish there was a viable left wing in the usa. there hasn t been since the 90 s at least. vote left and sacrifice the country and freedom at large  or vote right and promote traditional values that in part kept this country successful  and in some part are no longer required. the puritanical opposition to everything perceived as sexual is one of these. upskirts of underage girls was much more common a generation or two ago. not because people got off to upskirts of little girls  but because normal people saw it as cute in a non-sexual manner. league of legend s annie s former death animation and coppertone sunscreen come to mind. I haven t played chronotrigger  but I dont think the bulk of the game sexualized the girl.the bizzaro opposition to the anti-groomer bill coming from the left isn t helping things at all. there s absolutely no justification for opposing that bill  and there probably is a clutch of predators pushing it. the fact that the left does seem to  in part  be sexual predators  is giving a lot of wind to the right s general mistrust of anything the right perceives as sexual. thatsaid  polygons dont have an age  nor a mind  body  or soul  to harm. censorship is wrong  always.ps  keep it up mac! I want to see more videos  reguarless of this disagreement.
I think any sort of censorship is bad.artists should be able to express them selves no matter what.is that art form for you or not now that for you to decide.also I can draw a girl that looks like 20 but then in mind she would be 16  and vice versa.she s still not real and thatshouldn t matter.
I love your shirt so much
1. chaotic neutral  nah. neutral evil or true neutral.2. lara is dope as an assault unit in my x-com 2 squad.3. lara -could- have am equally sweet  sexy partner. what would be better than classic tomb raider  co-op classic tomb raider with puzzles and platforms that require teamwork!
that dress is fire!
melonie is based
you guys do realize that the original dialogue is actually in the switch version of chrono cross because you can actually put on the originals over the newer
you dont need to remind me  dammit
little girl underwear  aside I dont think it was worth censoring  because you could just emulate the game at 4k 144fps so one cost money censored the other is free uncensored  also I hear the pc version has fps problems talk about rubbing salt in the wound and pushing people more toward ambulation
gotta love how this disastrous port actually runs worse than og ps1 on all current systems  but biggest priority was censoring. the aaa games industry is a complete joke  -
I fear for the future of tomb raider
this chrono cross video got a bit off-topic with all the tomb raider talk.  anyway  I didn t even remember there being any panty shots for marcy.  since she s so young  this is one bit of censorship I ll grant.  that other change you mentioned though about leena being more ladylike I dont approve of at all.  first of all  wanting someone to be more ladylike is not an inherently evil thing.  second  changing it doesnt do leena or her little sister any favors.  with the original dialogue  the little sister looks strong and bold to say such a thing about her older sister and it gives leena a vibe of being tomboyish but still a good person.  with this new dialogue  leena sounds more like a bitch and the little sister sounds weak.  they didn t think this dialogue change through.
cant tell if your foundation is not matching your skin tone or your lighting is causing a weird look. but hey  good content as always. my wife always asks if I would point that out for her...not saying you look bad. just the lighting makes your face look lighter
pop culture is going to hell in a hand basket. these days I spend more time fishing  playing survivalist and working on john deere tractors. gaming was fun for twenty years or so. now days not so much. anime is still entertaining but the classic stuff from the 80s and 90s is better. Im just an old texan who is reverting to pre internet stuff.
no censorship  if you ever accept it that means the censors will aim to apply more censorship.if its ficitional its ficitional
there s some weird creepers out there but I dont like the dialogue changes. maybe they should have worked to make it actually run more than 20fps on ps5. Ive got my original copy here as it is.
Im against censorship but Im ok with this... then you aren t really against censorship are you  you aren t really for free speech.  the fact that they find a 9 year old sexualized enough that they think itshould be censored says more about them than anything else.
they did a re-ass-ter. lol!!!
why do people conflate real-life child age with fantasy fake characters  does age really matter on a fake drawing  I understand if it is explicit hardcore stuff but stuff like this is nonsensical.
on a scientific stand point  no matter if youre human or animal. everyone has the urge to be loved by someone. even if its not by many. many fans just want a realistic lara croft. lara croft isn t a robot. she s a full flesh human being. so by melonie saying she s this self absorbed person that hates everybody. it doesnt make sense. because its biologically impossible.
upskirt shot  eh  I remember underwear always has the same color as the clothes
the marcy change is totally understandable. that  break her in  line change   changing the skin color to lighter was definitely hilarious. lmao
its never necessary. they re killing the franchise.
generally Im against censorship  but yeah not gonna knock them for putting shorts on kids. razzly though isn t a kid  she s just a fairy. but still its not really a problem.
what you were saying about anime is exactly what has been keeping me away from it. I have watched one or two anime movies a few years ago with a friend who does like it and with those I had no problem but I just really do not like how they have characters that do not look like their age at all  especially if they are sexualized in any way.with that being said I also do not like how a lot of western studios make their characters that are supposed to be teens look like they are in their twenties thirties and show them having very  very intimate moments on screen. watched the first season of rivendell a while back  dont do that to yourselves  its not fun  and wondered why they never graduated. then I found out they were supposed to be 15 16 or something. just let teenagers be teenagers please  they dont need to be hooking up with everyone  drinking or taking certain substances in every second frame. I know there may be some who do act like that but they are luckily still a tiny minority.
I am a huge chrono cross fan the sensors on the 9 year old is fine but changing the text is going to far . you talked about a seen in tomb raider where you see under boob . pixelated under boob how does that work.
we come back to the dame thing...why are we allowing some random to dont let us enjoy something because they dont like I dislike the lolI characters  and even call my friends p3d0s  as a joke  when they say they like a lolI in an animeif I dont like something I just dont watch it  I will still judge and give bad stares to the ones who like  but I wont support endorse censoreshipwithout mention the double standars  shows like dancemoms  toddlers   tiaras and movies like cuties exist and to some people think its ok  but the moment where something similar happens on anime videogames  its evil and we must protect the non real imaginary children like chatacters
I think what you are looking to state is that lara is an anti-hero
I refuse to pay to have games I enjoyed wokeified.  the original was...  decent enough.  it certainly wasn t a sequel to chrono trigger  which literally everyone was  and still is  hoping for.  why they didn t update ct s graphics and try to make a buck off that  I have no idea at all.  I d have paid for that.  even judging the game on its own merits  it was...  pretty okay.  I can name a dozen squaresoft games I d have preferred get a remaster.  taking some liberties for the graphics  I can understand.  when you get more pixels  things can look more realistic  and may require a bit of imposed modesty to compensate.  what I have a problem with  however  is doing anything to change what the characters are saying  with the only exception being typos being fixed.
Im so glad I didn t buy this.  its a damn ps1 game.  nothing needed to be censored.
ow  my bloomers.
they should ve gotten rid of some of those useless tit characters.chrono cross has more than any other game. even suikoden.and add more double and triple techs. there s only two of the latter  and you need sprigg to turn into slash to do it.zoah and karsh can stay.gigan rules.
been outside lately and have gotten darker and I need to adjust my camera settings and also get new foundation to match lol
@melonie mac go boom  hey  its all good. I really appreciate your content. have kids and all but really support your stuff and again  my wife gets annoyed at things like that. so just lookin out for ya  tan looks good. keep up the hard work and speaking up for us less squeaky wheels.
even with explicit hardcore stuff itshouldn t matter and some hentaImanga have done that lol. its fake I dont care about the age of a fictional character that will never think  feel or breathe in the end freedom of expression should be respected and the art should be respected censorship is disrespectful and I just refuse to support it if I can avoid it because censoring was not the original vision. okay marcy had little panties on underneath who cares I certainly didn t. let the game be a product of its time  1999  and leave it be their job was to just remaster it and port it over that was it not censor the thing both in-game dialogue and models.
@naglfar94  totally agree with you and as I stated  I understand if it is hardcore and people complain but I personally dont care much about it. I see a lot of it in different imageboards and booru sites  all I do is keep scrolling and ignore it.
@naglfar94  spilling someone s brains and guts  torture and other stuff in games are okay by western standards but heaven forbid a fictional character shows a bit of underwear.
@team vostok  yes exactly also let us not forget something like cuties exists yeah I ain t letting that go yet ya know that movie that had real life people in it oh yeah that can exist not even censored either. but the minute an anime character or game character which is fake comes on its the end of the world. is almost like people care more about fictional characters than real life breathing feeling people. this is one of the things I have come to hate about modern gaming and entertainment in general this is why Imain the classics.
this is a weird hill to die on my dude. just saying.
they shouldn t be seeking realism  in a video game
@cyborg647  says you. obviously  many disagree with both of us. so thats why its really up to the video game developers what they want to do with their game.
if youre into fantasy stories  check out moribito  guardian of the spirit. its a show I use as an introduction to people I know who ve never seen anime before. no underage  or underage-looking  characters being sexualized  no sudden art-style changes  characters going super-deformed during comical scenes  etc   no  fan-service  that I remember. just a solid  epic tale of one woman trying to protect a young prince who s been targeted for assassination by his own father.
@benjamin smith  sounds good  might have to check that one out at some point. I do like fantasy. thanks for the suggestion
the original definitely has better subtitles there  could actually make me giggle... the panties  lol I dunno  is fictional ladies underwear no longer ok  is it because 1 or 2 people are weirder than the average player  lol. weird  dumb and unnecessary  censorship didn t help anyone.
while I typically cant stand altering classic games etc. I agree that taking out the child panties was fine. Ive been playing this game since it first came out and never truly noticed or cared  but once you see it...its pretty gross so its for the better in this case. the hard-core anti-sjws that are actually angry about this need to pick a better battle. I literally saw a comment saying  can we mod this!!  dude  you may have a problem.
I honestly thought the character was a little older  but Im only going on memory here. underwear shots dont really bother me because it wasn t intentionally sexual. the only way something becomes sexualized is when people find the time to focus so hard on it. and nowadays these kind of people find just about anything anime-related sexualized even when its not. and the dialogue change is the worst aspect of it because dialogue said by certain characters about another sets up personality and detail about them in the story  and to change that would change the characters themselves. anything regarding censorship degrades what made the original special. and what pisses me off the most is the fact that they went out of their way to change a character model and dialogue  but didn t take the time to deal with the bugs before shipping this out. itshows how much of a quick cash grab this was and what little priority the game was to them. all these combined is the reason I refuse to even purchase it.
o my your right the color will piss them off way more. ha ha ha
most of these normies pressuring game devs to redesign characters in the way they want to see them  remind me of folks who only want sanitarium white kitchens. characters in videogames should not reflect socio-political themes  but should be the brain child of the creators who sat around writer room tables  and hashed out how they want the character to come alive. if you want bland characters who are created solely based on woke ideology then go ask anita sarlacc pit for help.
your wearing a dress what   more dresses from melonie please.
it doesnt matter what the fictional character s age is  in a narrative setting a character can described as being over the legal age and still look and act like a child.
its the text censorship and the skin color change of the character that had her text censored that bothered me. the pantie shot is certainly in bad taste. it does not bother me that they censored it because I agree with the change and they should have done that change in classic mode too. I do find it very creepy and gross that adult girl characters are made to look like underage girls and it is in very bad taste and this is coming from a non-woke guy. it just always weirded me out in a couple of anime I saw and I eventually stopped watching those two anime because they always try to get these child girls and child looking adult girls in a harem with the male mc. they make girl characters like that in anime for the older guys  and there are a lot of these guys  in japan that like very young girls and there is a big culture for that mainly when it comes to idols. yuck.
chrono cross  hunter s laptop edition
I find it funny how no one mentions the fact that you actually fight marcy in this game  and how some are so concerned with her underwear. so I guess people are okay with essentially beating a kid  but oh God just dont show her underwear! sorry marcy  you aren t allowed to wear that  but its perfectly fine to beat the shit out of you!in all seriousness  it is censorship though  Imean this video shows that it was only changed in the new character models and left the same for the old  so if square was trying to censor it wouldn t you think they d change it for the old model too or even completely remove the old models  personally I think they were just trying to change up the new model a bit  but thats just me. I also dont see anything wrong with the original  mostly because I dont think they were trying to sexualize the character. just compare marcy to the other female characters in the game  because so many of those were clearly sexualized. Im not sure what to make of that text change though. seems like an odd choice  though with the way some people like to take everything out of context I guess maybe it had to be changed  I dont know.as for the tomb raider thing  Ive never played a single second of any game in the series though to me itsounds like they re ruining the character. itsounds like they want to inject too much reality into a character thatshouldn t be based on reality in the first place. leave the character alone  its fictional  as in not real  and it doesnt need a bunch of reality based bullshit. when I play games I do it to escape reality because to me reality and the real world are a fucking joke  and I dont want a bunch of realism and real life based political shit in my games.
wait  japanese companies are going woke  !  please tell me this is a western thing
you got it 1 2 right. thatshe is 9 makes it disgusting  but even if she was 30  gratuitous up-skirt shots serve only 1 purpose  and far too many japanese devs are guilty of littering their games with it. I have no problem with porn  I have no problem with nudity in games  witcher  dragon age  etc.   but there should be context.....not merely that every female character gets 3 bikinis to wear. its that type of perv idiocy that makes con-men  grifters like sarkesian gain some traction with normies.
some people were probably offended by the term ladylike because it prescribes a rigid set of non-sexual characteristics to the state of being female.in literal terms  lady-like would refer to the physiological traits of women with no relevance to social traditions or behavior.traits such as niceness  compassion and nurturing are not particular to women.
I couldn t care less about the underpants really but we have to ask ourselves this. if it was a loud in the first game  why is it not aloud now  what changed  I see it as no different than a bikinI bottom. its not a g string for Christ s sake! I just wish they would fix the frame rate on pc.
yeah I totally agree  in the situation the character is underage I have no problem with censorship  you have the example of kasumI her age appeared as n a in the first doa games because she was underage and was the way they found to slip some bikinis as outfits for her.also... short girls  not midgets  do exist I worked with a girl she was the height of a 16 year old but she was 30
go s a d
I dont really care about the censoring of the panties. thats probably a good thing considering the issue going on with kids right now in the us. however  the text  come on se  you dont need to adhere to the twitter religion. though if Im being honest  Im more aggravated that they took the time to do these small things  but failed to make the game fps stable.
I agree with censoring the 9 year old stuff  that is the kind of censorship I dont mind  and tbh this is the one aspect of japanese culture that I dont exactly jive with.  the whole lolI thing is just one thing I will never understand.  I dont think you are woke for being a little disgusted by it.  pretty sure the woke types would probably defend that more than most.
they changed una from a boy to a girl  lol
I get not wanting to sexualize young girls  but understand thatsquare have not stopped there. tifa was also censored and padded down  but thats the least of that game s problems... . people are getting fed up with the japanese censoring their content yet again to ingratiate themselves with western audiences  because that worked out so well when the shogunate did it .
3 or 4 aaa japanese game devs iirc have a ethics board  se and capcom to name two of them. also greed is another issue  not sure how many people who call square enix or view as japan s verison of ea unless it was another japanese gaming company.
was tifa really that big  or the polygons make them seem so
@pessiopt 9  in the game and the artwork nomura himself made  tifa was decently big. the sports bra thing  I actually get. but in the dress  while she admittedly does look nice  her chest was nerfed.
are you talking about hestia from danmachi
of all the things to complain about in the chrono cross remaster  this censorship seems like a non issue.I was way more bothered by the horrendous performance  on all platforms  than the censorship of a 9 year old s panties  which I think censoring it was the appropriate thing to do .
the  wokies  as you call  em would defend cuties so idgaf what they think needs censoring.if the game also includes the original models  which I think is what youre talking about 4 48  then I also dgaf about people complaining about the censorship.  in fact  I question anyone who gets upset over not being able to view 9yo upskirts.  idgaf if its in my game  but Im also not there for that.  itseems there are some people who are there just for that...
if this remaster has a pc port I hope modders fix all the sensorious f    ups square enix made on it.
got a little worried when I saw the title   but thank God its just this type of stuff. when I saw the weird changes to ffviiI  I was like   Im going to be distracted by siren s new skirt every time I see it.  this is a far cry from straight up removing a camera angle from me2 s remaster of a fully grown  and clothed  woman whose character depended on her sex appeal.
square enix is becoming like konamI but in their own way of bull crap.
is it really censorship if the company who made the original is also the one remaking the game  you cant really censor yourself lol  its their own choice
feminists  we must be strong women that can do anything men can do!also feminists  lara croft isn t a realistic woman. she needs to be less curvy  not so violent and needs a husband!
it fictional characters in a fictional world the characters age can be changed. she doesnt even look 9 just because some web site says she is 9 doesnt make it that way. its a fictional characters I can say she is 1000 it doesnt matter. the problem is the censorship if the original was so popular why alter it.
I love you!
hey melonie I just want to say that I hate or dont like when they remaster a old video game when they just make it first time and turn around and remake old video game to make it newer to be better and great than they did first time  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to make a comment bout this topic  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok melonie.
thats why I prefer uncharted bcuz nathan drake is more relatable than lara croft but that just me
when r u going 2b live on twitch again
loils creeps on suicide watch  well most of the time Im against censorship this is a rare occasion I really dont care.
that anime is boku no pico.
mel normally Im with you but if its only one line of text in the whole game its not a big deal. same with panties  on girls that look very young thst you canturn on or off. its honestly not that big a deal. thats honestly all that was touched . if it was more maybe I would be upset but meh
I understand that lara is a mythic character  but dont think its the case that lara doesnt have a personal life. its just mostly outside the scope of the games. sort of like how we never see her eat at the dining table or use the bathroom.
excuse me - as a true boomer  I am completely puzzled about changing lara!   leave her alone!
society and corporate media has poisoned our minds. I bought the og and still have it for ps1. never thought about any of that crap.
yes. this will make little johnny a better person. right after he gets done playing grand theft auto and any other 18  game that he s acquired.
agreed. thats a cultural difference I really dont mind remaining different.
I disagree with calling this a none issue. as you mentioned  the horrendous performance. it just means they care way too much about unimportant stuff than getting the game to work run properly. wasting money  time  and effort where it is not needed.
@samuraivader  going to give square a pass there too. they redid the models and interface with much more accuracy than they did for ffvii-ffix  while also sharpening the backgrounds without butchering the directional movement. this is a much better port than they ve done previously. the original version on ps1 ran so slowly that even the frame drops in this remaster wont stop it from being faster.
there was a pc port of cc  first time Im hearing this. if cc were on steam or gog  a mogurI style mod would render this port obsolete.
self-censorship is a thing. if an artist wants to produce something but changes it because other people wont like or accept it  you still get the result of not getting getting what the artist wanted to produce  so it is censorship. also  it is not exactly the same company  as the original was made before enix bought squaresoft and Im sure most of the original creators are not working on this version.
@joseph jackson  no one is telling se what to do with their game
@underthegun897  false. when your assets are managed externally  they do actually control what square does. its supposedly to clear square of liability.
@paris smith  its still se controlling what is in their game. which  by the way  the original dialogue of that first example is cringe
@underthegun897  private financing is complicated  my dude. you should look into a 2020 article published in the harvard law forum called  introduction to esg.  this is why square now has an  ethics board  and sony censors japanese games with no rhyme or reason.
@paris smith  if sq wants to publish a game  they have other options besides sony
@underthegun897  they do. I was only using sony as another example. basically  the larger the studio  the bigger the budget  no matter the size of the game   the less say the creatives have in what they make.
didn t even notice the underskirt until this was pointed out. a sad change that reflects how degenerate our society has become. I dont watch any gay anime but was that anime called gravitation
I think the reason they censored that line you should was the phrase  break her in   I am not pc or woke but that does sound like your treating a girl like an animal
its ridiculous people are so offended by a piece of cloth she s not real there s anime out there that children look alike can be 30 years old who cares if panties are shown
wow
youtube is getting cancerous with comment deleting .I cant even guess why my last two were yeeted.
when I see a gay or lesbian og character I dont go  you know what d be sweet if they weren t hmm what do you think make all the gay and lesbian straight then we have a character.
looking like a relative of donald trump. that orange complexion... just pulling your leg this is similar to ff8 remaster. sirens little kitty got some coverage now lol
I want to buy this game because I am 80-90 s guy that overlooked this gem. square enix new branch is a waste of money. this is one of the reasons I dislike localized in the usa.
lol the wokies happy. are they ever happy
its not a  she  and its not  9 years old  its a collection of pixels on a screen.
to be honest  I dont work at the  disney corporation  so I am not really that into the underwear of pre-teens... nor their sexual preferences.
so who are the people who played it in 1999 and played it again and thought  hey! they took out the 9 year old panties!   oh...or was it a comparison released by the developer
another terrible remaster
she is not real and that is not real world. if you dont like how it was shown in original cc  it is fine to dislike it but now you are just supporting censorship.
this is just destruction of art  original intent is lost.  no respect for work of others . the dialougue loses its original meaning  the piece is butchered.
your mentality of a child looking 30 so its ok is kinda nasty. yourealize a 15yo can look like a full grown adult and still be a child right  yikes
does  break her in  mean something different nowadays  because thats not a good thing. I dont think the  make her ladylike  is the issue.
I disagree melonie. changing the original creators vision in order to appease woke locust is stupid. modders are  having to work on restoring the original vision and fixing the performance issues.
holy cow what did you do to your camera  you are orange as trump. this is a far right dog whistle!
absolutely no issues with these changes  other than that text change from  ladylike   which is just stupid. that change doesnt even aggravate me on censorship grounds  but Im legit just taken aback by how petty someone s complaint had to be for that.
based comment lol. thanks for keeping it real
in that case  cp is fine. its just ink on wood pulp  or a collection of pixels on a screen.
@jordan breon  you cant compare actual cp that involves real living breathing human beings big emphasis on the real part to a fictional character. it is people like you that ruin stuff like this or try to because ya ll cant tell apart fiction from reality. you can do what the heck you want with any lolI or character or whatever but when real children are involved that is a different story.
@naglfar94  I never said anything about harming a child. using your logic  a person consuming cp that had nothing whatsoever to do with its creation has no idea if it is real or not  and therefore is acceptable. how would you differentiate between the two  as visual technology advances  the real and the fake become less distinguishable.cp is not just harmful because of the cruelty of its creation  otherwise  only the creators would be punished. no  cp consumption  possession  dissemination  etc  is punished because the people consuming it are creating a demand for it  leading to more harm to children. as  fakes  become ever more indistinguishable from real  then the consumer of the material is doing the same thing. besides which  it is splitting hairs. if a visual artist makes a deep fake of cp of a child that doesnt exist  but then copies the facial features of a child that does exist  your logic would make this permissible. after all  a child s facial features are not cp  and the rest is just  a collection of pixels on a screen .
@jordan breon  whoa there pal dont try and play those mental gymnatsics with me you are comparing night and day. firstly deep fakes resemble actual real children and sometimes these can be taken from actual children actual people so their is still potential harm done you are equating real people to fictional anime game characters especially when it comes to lolI characters these characters with their exaggertaed and often not realistic looks are worlds apart from real children or deep fakes which btw deep fakes or anything that resembles real live people used like that in a way of intent of cp can land a person in trouble.so do not even compare that two my logic at what I said does not loop around to cp you can clearly tell the 2 apart. like I said if lolI anime characters or drawings make u think of real stuff or things that resemble reality then there is something wrong with you. so dont even go there bud.
@naglfar94  I just extrapolated the logic of the op. the comparison is valid  and it is a real concern  both for children and artists in the genre. to simply imply  as the op did  that the difference between actual cp and child-like artwork is that one is real and the other is just a collection of pixels is a vast oversimplification. further  it is inadequate as a line in the sand. if I were an artist or game developer I would want as clear a line as is possible so that I dont end up being over it. I get why people use these oversimplifications  as in the past it was not possible to create something that could be mistaken for cp. thats no longer the case  and pretending the issue is as simple as real or fake will end up with someone getting into severe hot water or actual cp peddlers using loopholes like the example I gave prior to harm children. while I dont find the appeal in so-called lolI art  surely those who do can see what would happen if the art became more lifelike. people would demand action  and governments and media would land on it like a ton of lead. it is in their best interest to not hand wave away objections and work to get clarity on the issue. because once people associate it with cp peddlers  thats the end of it. you dont want to be trying to argue nuance once that is the case.
they do seem to be the experts on real life illegal activities with non adult people
I  always thought that was the feminine equivalent of a dude saying   harden him up.  the dude isn t saying  give him a boner   he s saying to prepare the guy for the future. make him tougher. thats what I took from that line  anyway.
Ive been outside and gotten darker  but the camera is making me look orange. I need to adjust the settings now
orange woman bad  get this lady an umbrella to protect her from the sun
