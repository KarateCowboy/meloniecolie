I find james creepy and gross based on statements he s made in the past  but can appreciate him defending chris from the woke mob. chris pratt is based  religious and a family man. definitely one of the good guys. congrats on being an aunt!!!!
the fact that his coworkers continue to stand by him is a testament to chris being a good person. even his ex-wife is still friendly with him.
I dont trust gunn  but I ll respect him for this.
thats really heartwarming hearing james gunn having chris pratt s back like this especially because he doesnt have the same worldview as him. my respect for him just went up a thousandfold. also  hooray for gfuel renewing their sponsorship with you  melonie! Ive never bought their products before  but I ll definitely be purchasing some now.
they re bullies and control freaks. look at the way they tried to bully gina carano before disney decided to use an flimsy as hell excuse to fire her.  beep bop boop indeed!and as a non tattoo person  I think your tattoos are well drawn and quite tasteful.  kudos to the artist.
I would have more respect for james gunn doing this if he hadn t also participated in cancelling gina carano and roseanne barr. hes part of the problem.
the more I watch you  the more I love what you have to say. youre so on point. people can disagree with one another  but just treat people with respect. actions speak louder than words. at least they used to...
first off congrats on you being an aunt. secondly  its so dumb that people want to judge others by grouping them in with a larger body of people. they may not hold to the same standards as the group at all. the accuser may have experienced some negative interaction with someone related to that group and decided that all people are that way. a person is responsible for their own actions. not a group that they may or may not be associated with. by the way  the term Christain is very broad and includes many different groups within. that goes for many other groups as well.
people nitpick about anything and will use it against anyone to empower themselves. like bringing up gunn s statements in the past or pratt s beliefs. but I just dont get it. why do you have to attack others when you can clearly work on yourself  oh  thats right  its easier. sigh.keep up the great work  melonie. and congrats on aunthood!
when I was a kid  and by that Imean too young to shave and my voice hadn t changed yet  I had a neighbor that grew up in stalin s soviet union. he told all kinds of horror stories about what life was like there. what s most worrying about the stories he told is that they are a lot like what we see going on right now in woke america. the only thing that will stop them is if people rise up in numbers and defy them.
just watched the northman today and quite honestly as far as norse sagas go I thought it was okay  a little difficult to follow with those trippy sequences of him figuring out his destiny but overall enjoyable. now as for those umm scenes where they do the binky bonk with each other  melonie they were as tasteful as they could be and trust me Ive seen worse binky bonk scenes in modern movies but at least he didn t binky bonk his mom so count your blessings there. overall I think it can count as parent and adult child viewing if both are into norse sagas and now for a reccomendation from me  try watching both bahubalI films because they just get ridicculusly stupid as they go on and they do tell a good story as well.
hey melonie  I just wanted to say  thank you  for highlighting my comment from a few videos back. it wasn t my intent to be combative  I was just looking for clarification on your comments and beliefs. I respect you and your views as such  and my only point was about interpretation and how it may lead to different results for different people. a quick example would be  thy shall not kill murder . depending on how it is interpreted  kill vs. murder   it can lead to vastly different conclusions. anyway  Im still a fan subscriber and continue to enjoy your commentary. thanks again!
the mcu never should ve pander to a 2  vocal minority of domestic terrorists that dont buy any of these things
chris pratt deserves more support.
congrats aunt melanie
congratz on becoming an aunt  I just became a grandfather and fell in love with him at first sight.  make sure you spend as much time being an aunt as possible  because they grow up fast!  God bless and high five!!
melonie  have you heard about clutchbelk   the canceled warzone streamer  he was called sexist for trash talking a female streamer during a tournament. nothing he said to her was something he wouldn t have said to a male in the same situation. people also blamed him for things his chat said in other streams about the situation.  it has cost him tens of thousands of dollars. he used to have videos on his twitch channel explaining his side of things  but I think he took them down.
to narcissists anything but admiration feels like oppression.
hey melonie  thank you for the amazing channel ! I really enjoy your verse of the day. have you ever watched the how great is our God tour by louie giglio  if not it is life changing! I am praying for you!
oh and congrats to you  my old friend. being a sister and daughter is one thing  being an aunt is something else. enjoy.
Imean people on both the right and the left got pissed at gunn for making a joke I find the outrage weird but you do you lol
@God emperor leto atreides ii  why did they get drunk at him
statements he made in the past you mean the fake retweets he created just to prank his friends
@eric staples  well he is ok with cancel culture if it isn t him or his  friends . in this case its his cash cow. I find those ideals of his disgusting.
if he didn t know chris pratt in person  he d probably be trying to cancel him as well.
@chris  garaunteed
I never got onto twitter before it was even available. now that its booming  Im less inclined to get a handle.ps chris pratt ftw
chris pratt loves a good comeback story just like kim kardashian  thats why he s invincible!
I hate their logic that they have the right to complain about what they dont like while we are wrong to even question what we dont like.
your tattoos look great and are sexy to be honest. I dont understand people that just get completely random tattoos just to get them  I have about 50 hours of work on tattoos that all have meaning to me  but to each their own. anyone trying to put you down because of your tats are just dumb and jealous because they couldn t pull it off.
respect is not forced it is earned after watching you over the last few months Im determined as you are that no one will make me think how they think I should be thinking. and what is this with using about every letter in the alphabet to describe individuals lifestyle why not just stick with gay and lesbians no one is going to ever interfere with my freedom of speech no one and Imean no one has to justify their existence in this world or how they think and feel. and your tattoos look fantastic.
if g fuel still has the spider-man no way home flavor many thanks loledit well they tried to cancel gunn over a joke so maybe he learned his lesson to a degree
melonie   congrats on your imminent aunthood...   great video...
if you look for problems you will only ever find problems  and then nothing will ever be good enough
congratulations on being an ant I know that you will be a great one!
people need to stop trying to cancel chris!
congratulations on becoming an aunt... have a blessed day!!!
these people are putting the celebrities into  God  status  and holding them into unobtainable traits. when one s pantheon of  Gods  has one that doesnt fit the mold. this breaks their flawed foundation and ruins their blindly  worshiping  for them. the woke and the unwoke are both guilty of this.congratulations becoming a aunt and on your family. I pray and wish  you and your family a wonderful times together  and God s will for you all.in the meantime  go boom
go  cuddle the baby.  we ll be here when you get back.  congrats!
congrats again on the aunt thing
if you lost friends  because of your  faith  then  they weren t  true  friends in the first place.  btw my mother  always  said  I was a devil  worshiper  but I have  no need for God s  or devil s  and I enjoy  your  youtube videos
I support chris pratt. I think he s an exceptional actor  from comedy in parks and rec  all the way to his work on the big screen. I would be bias  though. I get along with conservatives better. I do also support a society with a base system of morals and ethics.I like all your tattoos but I do have this weird personal thing about portrait tattoos. I know it doesnt make sense but thats me. wouldn t be a dealbreaker for me but its not like its about me. I d never ask you to change. dont be afraid to stand up for what you believe in. youre doing good.
james was cancelled  fired as director from guardians. then disney went back and rehired him. so at any case  he s probably defending chris from the point of someone who has already been cancelled.
hey good thursday afternoon melonie I just want to say that I am so happy that james gunn has chris pratt s back bc some people like chris pratt has different views than other people and I think that it is not right to judge other people s believes in faith and other religion like that  ok melonie. anyway in the Bible which I do not know what scripture itsays in that itsays that do not judge others believe  if you want to be judge of your believe. anyway I just want to say that I do am so happy that james gunn has chris pratt s back and stand up for other person s believe  ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment bout james gunn standing up to chris pratt s back  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today and week with your family   your brother and with your new baby nephew melonie. anyway have a great day and week melonie.
gunn better have his back.  it would be the hight of hypocrisy if gunn didn t  considering his own history with cancellation.
it is his faith at trial. they call use the oppressors while oppressing us.
if only james did the same for gina carano and roseanne barr but no  he was whole-heartedly all for canceling them even after he was supposedly  canceled  himself briefly. gunn is a part of the problem  thus he can get bent for all I care.
felicidades  es un buen ejemplo.  364  sentadillas son unos girls18.uno muchas y un buen ejercicio.  se deja ver que hay muy buenos resultados  saludos desde la cd.. de world   los mortalesl abian apreciado tan hermosa mujer.k
Im really really sorry that you ve lost so many of your friends since your return to faith in our Lord and saviour. he alone knows what youre going through at any point  so you can cast your burdens on him  psalm 55   but you are forever blessed in him who is able to keep you on the right path.
I delivered a baby in the back of an ambulance. it was a 4-hour transfer in the canadian rockies in the dead of night. fun fact  babies go boom  too! kid shot out like a cannon...  fortunately  Im the johnny bench of paramedics  so he didn t quite manage to pull off an  umbilical bungee.  intercepted!  go boom.
they just dont like him because he s a Christian.  he never said anything negative against the lbgt  community.  its good to see his director and other actors standing up for him.  from what people who know about him say about him  he s a nice guy who treats other people right.  if more people stood up to the mob and supported other viewpoints  maybe the wokies would just shut up.
this could all easily be solved if...  proceeds to do terrorist hostage video trope
I really dont get it why the cancel mobs get so much attention  just ignore the freaks  their whole model is based on attention  just dont do it  dont give em what they want...
what s sad is that he doesnt even go to this homophobic church everyone was so mad about. he goes to zoe  a church that broke away from hillsong to do their own thing. people would have figured it out years ago if they bothered but they didn t. they re the idiots who rely on twitter for information. they re the lazy  judgemental people who gets easily led by crowd  looking for something to hate. there are real bigots out there and they re stupidly focusing on chris  who s crime was not saying anything about his political stance. not that it matters fyI  but Im inclined to believe he leans more left than right. he donated a few times to democratic campaigns before and is married to a trump hating democrat. the left seems to think otherwise just because he didn t show up for a biden rally  ignoring the fact that he was busy filming jurassic world dominion in london when it was happening. every negative thing people have heard about chris are based on rumors and speculation.
so what if he s a Christian or muslim or ... its his personal life none of our business! is he a good actor when he s in front of a camera     thats what matters. Im saying this as a muslim  all the power to him and God bless him. ps  congrats on becoming an aunt!
I dont particular think that chris pratt is a  good  actor but I think that this passtime of picking targets to hate on is only hurting what should be honest discussions we should be having. in fact the very people screaming about equality and inclusiveness are doing their level best to treat others less equitably. interesting isn t............great job as always mel!
chris evans took a picture with dan crenshaw and showed respect for him. where s all that outrage
there is no amount of groveling that is enough for the woke crowd.
I really hope elon musk starts cleaning up twitter so that all these crazies start holding less sway over public opinion.
good to know we have people on the inside of marvel stilll.  so it wont go completely to sh t yet.
hypocrisy is one of those things that hypocrits dont understand. thats my problem with the left. freedom of speech  belief  and personal opinion is a one way street for many of them. most people are nuanced and highly complex in their beliefs. this is why we are taught to judge actions. we ll  we used to be taught that. even as an atheist or agnostic  whichever you prefer to use as a label  I still took that lesson to heart. Ive shared many conversations about the topic of faith with many different people  some of them family members  and have yet to walk away feeling judged or belittled. not saying there aren t people who would judge me for my beliefs  or the lack there of. all Im saying is that itseems like Ive managed to approach the subject with a more curious conversational tone  rather than a fully shoulder-chipped argument. anyway enough rambling. stand strong mr. pratt. nobody should suffer being mobbed and bullied. great points melonie. oh. above statements also apply for those on the right as well.
petition for you start or end the next video saying  aunty mac goes boom
chris pratt follows the the golden rule do unto others as you want them to do unto you also mathew 7 1-3
chris pratt appears to be a decent down to  earth guy but as a Christian guy does he really want to bee defended by gunn after his really sordid past
Im not a Christian  but I think the hate that pratt is getting is f ing stupid. he hasn t said anything to make them think what they think  but they will attack him anyways. smh
congrats  aunty  mel!
there is a big difference between what you used to be and the person who redeems themself. part of the problems in society is the complete and total lack of forgiveness. chris pratt at least upholds that tenant.
its one thing to critique what a person believes. its another to critique what they are. one is rational  the other is emotional. the wokies have conflated these two such that an attack on an idea is an attack on a person. they use this defensively to deflect having to argue their positions  but have found that they canturn it around and use it offensively too  pratt attends a Christian church so he must believe in traditional marriage  therefore he must be anti-homosexuality  and thus he is an  oppressor.  all of a sudden his belief becomes his very identity  and grants them duty and right to target him for destruction.  the worst part about this is that it is all based on assumptions. I dont believe pratt has ever taken a stand on any issue.
the woke mob are mad that we love God  family and guns. we love each other and that we want to protect our children from them!
imagine if they told that to Jesus  what would he say
it used to be enough to just live and let live. now you must validate  you must be an ally  you must not speak against even in jest. let live only ever went one way. be quiet  comply  consume  science is God  your children will be fine... keep speaking out melonie!
sorry lot of comments   - chris pratt is the only actor that I would actually like to meet.
the only argument Ive heard against Christians getting tattoos is the  your body is a temple  line.  last I checked  every temple has decorations.  the idea that you cant get into heaven if you have body modifications is absurd.  Jesus himself had extra holes in his body when he checked in at the gates.  though  he was sent back shortly after...  so there s that.
oppressive groups    if youre on the light side of the force  the dark side is oppressing you.  if youre on the dark side of the force  the light side is oppressing you..  I guess its difficult to have perspective when you live in a different universe than the person youre talking smack about.
melonie mac looks like a game character with those tattoo s or something but lit video yeahyeyeyeye hail mortal !
well perhaps he said the right things here but I dont really buy his crap. Im sure he knows he can boldy claim chris would never be replaced as star-Lord because star-Lord will probably be killed off in the final guardians and james knows that will please the mob
facts
maybe pratt isnt political   ive only heard leftists say what he believes politically  never actually heard it from the man himself. and maybe he is conservative  though I highly doubt it   and thats not a big deal either  but im not going to actually form a political opinion on him unless I actually start seeing him show his politics. I hope he never does  idgaf what actors vote for  or who they vote for  their job is acting. when they become activists its scary  because they have such narrow veiws and experiences in reality
chris pratt crime seems to attending a standard issue protestant church. he  has never had anyone Ive heard who worked with him have a bad word to say about how he interacted with anyone on or off set. .
go boom!!!!
can I confess something   I dont personally like tattoos.  they re not for me.  other people like them  and you know   thats up to them.  its not my business what someone else does with their own body  nor is it my place to condemn or insinuate that God will condemn them.  thats not my call to make  in fact  I dont think its anyone s call to make.  God makes up his own mind on the matter  and as we were given free will  we have the right to decorate ourselves as we see fit.
my mom is a pastor with blue purple hair and tats youre all good by me
it is because the muslim community would not put up with it and back it up with deeds  because they do not apologize for their faith.  they know Christians  turn the other cheek  and that doesnt happen with other faiths.  lgbt people should just get on with their lives and stop trying to  force people to embrace their lifestyle.
still think chris uses his  faith  just as a scouts badge to show off. looking at his donations  endorsements and politicial leanings  he doesnt live up to his Christian faith. left wont stop until we all are mindless sheep following them. congratulations on being a aunt! enjoy your new nephew! !
wait that was the joke  I didn t even see it like and still dont. these people are crazy.
Ive never understood the whole  its un-Christian to have tattoos  thing. the rule against tattoos was part of the holiness code of the ancient israelites  the same rules that paul went out of his way to explain to us that we as believers are no longer bound by  and how we are basically diminishing Jesus s sacrifice when we feel we still need to keep those rules in order to be saved. the anti-tattoo crowd just doesnt understand that. personally I dont think I d ever get a tattoo as Im no fan of pain  but if melonie or any other fellow believer wants to get a tattoo  I really have no right to tell them not to do so.
my youngest sun laughs and said thats an airplane girls head
@john  my tattoo of a black dragon wrapped around a rugged wooden cross has opened up several conversations about my beliefs.  I would be willing to accept that the content of the ink may be at issue  but I had no intention of getting any 6 s or 9 s on my forehead  or a pentagram anywhere.
if they cant stand him  then quit watching his movies
these people think that everyone with a voice needs to answer to them  they re nobody s stop bothering with them. btw if you cant make babies youre doing it wrong but thats your choice  dont bother me with it
@melonie mac go boom     you lost a lot of friends   on the contrary  those people were never really your friends to begin with.
if you lost friends because you came back to Jesus then they weren t really your friends to begin with.
its funny how they always say religious or conservative people have a fear of them.
I dont like his personal desctions  kiddy jokes were way too suspisious  butt            chris was one of the first to say  if gunn wont direct gotg im gone too   way before this stupid drama exploded  and now gunn defending chris about this nonsense  makes me respect him
these users are crazy
so james gunn is defending prattdoes james gunn have any misdeeds of his own
how dare you tell me what me can or can not tell you  who are you to tell me what me can or can not to tell you. you know there is a lot of t s in thatstatement. lol your great  dont change unless you want to. their I go telling you what to do  or not. what ever Im over this ha.
they need to leave chris alone!
chris pratt s opinions is what have him constantly being attacked by the woke mobs. but  I am neither woke nor any of the above. I like the guy s roles in movies and if people want to stand with him then  so be it. but  I will not be roped in with those who either attack or defend him. if he goes and ruins his own career that is on him and I will have nothing to do with it like the rest of the hate culture or the woke people want to throw their hats in the ring for.to help suite their own agendas.   leavemeoutofit
why cant we just stick to the golden rule  do to others as you wish them to do on to you. and if you dont have anything good to say  keep it to yourself
commenting to feed the algorithm
great he defends his friend who is innocent of these internet weirdos  but I still dont like james gunn...but as always great video melonie.
congratulations
aunt melonie   makes you sound old
I just spoke the truth and youtube didn t like that.  fascinating.so now I have to do it again.leviticus 20 13.Im not going to do the full speech.  but no one is better than anyone else.  and anyone is welcome in a church.
those who abuse religion for power deserve to be punished for their sins and those who create cults and force people into them only parrot the same hateful rhetoric also deserve the fate  btw Im not Christian at all Im wiccan but even I understand that not all religions are perfect but not all practitioners are evil.
I dont need to go around telling people Im not homophobic or racist because I let my actions show that Im not a homophobic or racist person. because actions speak louder than words. also where is this unwritten rule that people in hollywood have to vote democrat
youre wrong melonie.  those groups do not have to love or respect the abc groups.  we dont even have to tolerate them either.  we dont have to hate them either.  we just dont want anything to do with these people.  they are not happy with just doing their thing as they promised they would.  so we cant just ignore them.  they wont sit down and talk.   thus respect is not given  it is earned.stop with the nonsense of claiming we have to do anything with these people.  we wanted to be left alone.  we can see how that is working out.it wont end peacefully  until they are ready to sit down at the table again.
you dont have to like james gunn  I dont like him either  but he s right for once. when this  chris is homophobic  lie started I thought it d die down because of how ridiculous it was. he s not homophobic and he doesnt even go this antI lgbt church everyone was annoyed about. he goes to zoe  a church that broke away from hillsong to do their own thing. it freaked me out when people started to say it like its fact because itshowed me just how harmful misinformation is. a lot of the twitter users are toxic and creepy  spreading their lies to try and ruin a innocent man s livelihood. these days you dont need proof to frame someone.
she s only 36.
all we can hope for is for you to stop making youtube videos  but I sincerely doubt thats going to happen.
sorry to see you leaving the human race to become an insect  but its way better to be an ant than morphing into a cockroach a la kafka.
I believe the opinions are highly overrated. and pretty damn useless.
enough with intro  ok  just get to the point
muslim is an ethnicity islam is the religion..... u missed your point because of this error
yeah I based move. from james gunn but i. still hate the double standard.   hypocracy of hollywood. turning a blind eye. to james gunn s pedophilic jokes. because he s liberal  but they ll cancel anyone. who doesnt follow they re woke dogma. for example someone like rosanne for politically incorrect jokes.
cry about it more
wrong. muslims are people who practice islam. they are millions of muslims that are ethnically scottish  african  irish  english  german  spanish  and asian. you are completely wrong. as a matter of fact  islam is a fast growing religion among young european men in france  germany  and britain. they consider themselves muslims.
wrong. a muslim is an individual who practices islam. educate yourself.
