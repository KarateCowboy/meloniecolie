in other versions  daphne has self-defense abilities.  the whole group always respected velma s intellect.  mindy kaling is the one who is degrading the characters.
fred wasn t just some typical popular guy .he was aways really nice and respectful towards anyone.even in the introduction episode he was treating shaggy like his best friend and tried to understand his emotions.that was one of his greatest characteristics.he was aways trying to help people when ever there is a mystery.he cares for others .he is like the big brother of the team.he aways took care of his team when ever they were down.
as soon as I saw that fred was the only one not race swapped  I immediately knew this is exactly what they were going to do to him.
fred was a good example for men and women alike. he always thanked  encouraged  listened to everyone  even the girls. some people are like  ew he s a creep he always went with daphne and or velma.  uh  yeah  people shipped them the show knew what it was doing. also scooby and shaggy were the more comedic characters so them going off alone was like the comic break while the others did serious detective work. and they paired up velma with them sometimes because she was a good straight man compared to their antics. he was never creepy or belitting it pisses me off that this show and all the newer scooby movies dont understand the characters or mock them.
fred was the perfect leader of the group. he would always try to motivate shaggy and scooby to succeed in their part at catching the criminal in the group s plan. he listens to everyone s input in solving the mystery. lastly  he usually would give all the credit to whomever did more work in catching the criminal towards the end.
funny how kaling decided some of the other characters weren t defined by their  whiteness   as she said  but that fred was. and then added even more things thatshe apparently thought are closely connected to whiteness. note also thatshe s having her self insert crushing on fred  and making fred realize her value. Im sure we can infer various psychological things here  lol.
fred always congratulated his teammates even when shaggy and scooby-doo crash into a wall or something and reveal a secret door or place with clues to the current mystery.
fred was literally the trap master of the group. Im 98  confident some of his traps were patented too. he was literally the reason the gang was able to capture the bad guys at the end in the first place. there have been a handful of movies and tv shows that legit p ssed me off  the last jedI and the final season of got etc. . but velma falls under the category of those incredibly rare shows that p ss me off without me even watching the show  cuties and dahmer are also examples of such shows .
Imiss when the show was just about a wholesome group of friends solving mysteries. the whole dynamic was just as you said  around 4 22 - treating eachother with respect despite them each being from typically separate cliques at high school.
what bothers me about fred is how they had to give him a reason to be friends with unpopular velma. in the original they all bonded over solving mysteries regardless of social status. gives a positive message that mutual interests and enjoying each others companies is all you need. however now the message is if youre unpopular you ll only gain they re respect by saving them... like no  people can be friends by bonding over mutual interests.I was like a floater kid in highschool  friends with many groups for different reasons  so I related well to the scooby doo squad as a kid. probably gave me confidence to talk to people Imay not of otherwise who knows. but kids now a days will see this and be like ohh velma only got the popular kids attention by doing something for them...
daphne was never  eye candy  she might have acted ditzy  but they never sexualized her.
you have to love how they attack fred for taking credit for someone else s work while they are literally taking someone else s work and asking for credit.
it was quite obvious these people hate not only scooby doo but the fans as well. the first words from the velma trailer are her belittling the fans.
I fucking knew it. the minute I saw fred was the only character not being race swapped  I knew they were going to assassinate his character. it wasn t even a hard character to get right  and yet they did.
Ive got a few words for you  scooby-doo on zombie island. the perfect scooby movie  and it tackles all of the things they re trying to shoehorn in.
from my experience people with daddy issues dont tend to grow up to be like fred. most guys who are strong and into sports tend to be pretty well adjusted people.
one of my favorite things in the live action scooby doo movies is that daphne learned to fight because she was sick of being kidnapped .
you dont remember this  but each character in the original series had strengths and flaws  scooby and shaggy were complete cowards until they ate scooby snacks. velma was the brains of the operation but she d occasionally get caught or otherwise get herself into trouble. fred was the leader and man of action  but his overly complicated contraptions to trap the ghost monster whatever often went awry  particularly because daphne tripped  knocked something over  etc.  so much so thatshe was nicknamed  danger-prone daphne.  daphne and scoob  shaggy found the clues and velma and fred figured them out. no need to  fix  or change any of the characters  they were just fine as they were.
velma was never an outsider from group  they are all friends. fred never underminded velma. if anything  he would listen to her on just about everything everytime.
itsounds like they just wanted to insult fred in every way possible. this seems like perfect example of why hiring people that aren t fans of the original needs to stop happening.
if someone else draws a semi-naked daphne  these woke creeps would go nuts...saying all sorts of negative things like they are portraying women as mere sexual objects etc
she hated them because they are popular than her.
good to know the name of the piece of shit  thanks.
Imean jeez  in the movie daphne kicked the wrestler dudes ass.
in the 2000 movie daphne learned karate
@psychedelic fox  its possible to dislike a persons work  attitude  and  creativity   without caring about their race. and all the reasons to dislike mindy s  work  and  creativity   is stated in this video.
@psychedelic fox  we scooby doo fans are not racist. its the non fans that think its somehow racist for 4 white kids to hangout that are actually racist.
daphne would also sometimes use her knowledge of fashion to help solve mysteries.
@psychedelic fox  its hilarious that you have to change someone else s argument in order to debunk it while also being unaware that youre doing it.keep beating thatstraw man  buddy. Im sure it deserves it.
and his  flaw  wasn t a  oh  small d energy  haha late bloomer  how dare his body be unique . he was a trap affifionado and he could lose focus on the mystery by trying set up the most bonkers rube goldberg machines.
exactly  hell he wasn t even perfect he was actually kind of a weirdo which gave him a lot of charm
exactly

bring himbo fred back
he used too be sexist lmao
@beeg yoshi  Imean  no shit  it was made in the 50 s and 60 s  what did you expect
in the 2002 movie  daphne became a black belt and  transformed  her  body into a dangerous weapon   her words  not mine .
@psychedelic fox  they re mad about the  representation  coming at the cost of replacing legacy characters with a depiction of them that is twisted into something that they never were.
@psychedelic fox  doesnt look like anyone here but you is saying that.
now daphne is as obnoxious as scrapy doo
is she that annoying indian girl from the office
@psychedelic fox  - the reason why itseems like everything is about race is because you are carrying it with you. you are the one who implied racism because of her skin tone  nobody else has said anything like that. they dont like mindy because she is a selfish and narcissistic and she always makes anything she is involved with all about her.she is degrading the characters in many ways  you can either see it for what it is or continue being willfully ignorant  I dont really care. based on past experiences with woke sjws my bet is on continued willful ignorance and race-baiting  but I d like to see some awareness and growth for once.
they re degrading all our beloved characters
@sergio  the hypocrisy is very disheartening
@psychedelic fox  so for the record Im south east asian and the dislike has nothing to do with racism its that velma is already an established character and changing her race for no reason is just shallow pandering. no issue with representation its just that if these show runners want more representation than just make original characters of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds.
@a s  it just blows my mind on so many levels!
@psychedelic fox  uh did you bother to watch the video  or did you come just to blindly accuse everyone of being racist
@psychedelic fox  I wasn t talking about anyone in particular but rather your approach to this thread as a whole.in fact you literally added something to my comment and focused on that instead of addressing my comment directly. thats the exact thing of which I accused you  complete with the relevant lack of awareness.
@silvus sol  well said.
@that guy with the face  looks like you hit a little too close to the mark as the fox has resorted to insult and denigration.
as much comfort as it is that hearing that the majority of people have common sense  we shouldn t be giving this show free publicity.we should be ignoring this completely so their rage-bait attempts dont work.
@psychedelic fox  you need to lay off the drugs.
@psychedelic fox  at least rick and morty I original and wasn t an altered version of an existing ip
@psychedelic fox  south park and rick and morty are original ips thats not even up for debate lol
clearly she never watched every original scooby doo and never got the message behind it. theres fred  daphne  velma  shaggy... all different people who can care about each other. oddly yes they have a talking dog named scooby and he is important. Imean come on hes the name character of the show.  they all had a part in the group even if it was hard to notice at times
@raximus3000  yep. velma was the detective  fred was the leader  shaggy and scooby were the bait  and daphne was often the pretty one. though in recent years  she s had other traits  like knowing self defense  or having the revelation thatshe s  accident prone   which would explain how she had been the damsel in distress in the past.
wtf is going on with wb andhanna barbera stuff
@sergio  rule 34 already has thatcovered.
@nemo pouncey  lmao what is rule 34
@aaron s  literally watching that movie rn   she beat this huge muscular dude
@raximus3000  that would explain a lot....
@psychedelic fox  there s a difference between basing characters on real people and just having characters be inksuit actors. there is nothing wrong with inksuit actors if its done well...but this doesnt look like mindy understands who velma is at all...and now even kate miccuccI and gina rodriguez cant play velma without that one specific old joke becoming canon..oh and during mystery inc  mindy cohn was effectively told  dont argue with the writer  just voice your character  when she really didn t want that joke to be canon...and asked cervone to knock it off  cervone effectively told mindy cohn  the fan favorite and longest tenured velma to shut up and give into the joke...she  retired  due to health issues of course  but she was also concerned about character integrity...and when she fought it...she probably got fired under the guise of  retirement . let thatsink in. velma most likely got fired from herself...because she thought her character was being mishandled. how would you feel if that happened to the character you had been voicing for over a decade was suddenly given a big change all for the sake of confirming an old joke..that even the voice actors hate.raceswapping is not the problem. its that now fan writers who dont get the characters are confirming that joke as canon. no. most of us prefer to either take the 80 s route  which 2002 s wnsd confirmed rather blatantly as to who the pairings were  velma gets freddy  shaggy gets daph or googie...alt. 2019 shows velma flim flam possibility.  or keep the pairings ambiguous...because even in scooby-doo relationships are more fun when they are mysterious and fan speculated but never fully confirmed. thats not to say they cant have alternate relationships  but it would have been better to have introduced a new character who is to join the group for a bit or bring back some older established scooby characters based on alternate celebrities. a better way to have done this would have been bring back vincent van ghoul and flim flam like they did in 2019 and have them go on a few cases...with van ghoul being the alternate one since vincent price was.
@psychedelic fox  my dude  you started this whole mess by saying and I quote   mindy kaling is the one who is degrading the character because she s a brown asian and those rice pickers are takin  over muh country!  is what you meant to say  right  you sure didn t give any reason as to why you dont like her but the majority of people dont either and they make it clear that they re racist. you accused the person who began the thread of being racist by projecting your views on to them  ignoring that they said daphne in some iterations took self-defenses classes because she was fed-up with being a damsel in distress all the time and that velma was never undervalued for being the smart one of the team. the one time she felt like she was it was an important plot point in the live-action movie. I also want point that that there were a few times that daphne has even shown intellect that rivaled velma s  just putting it out there. you were the one accuse everyone of racism with no proof other than your own bias thoughts about everyone who didn t think like you. people like you always make it about race when it isn t.
@psychedelic fox  the writer can like  make a new mystery crew  one who has poc in it. why use old characters if they can do that it also hits your point of the writers being inspired by real events and people since they re not at all going to be fully tied to the  50 years of nostalgia  and therefore can be anything that you canthink of.just saying as a 4 11 semibisexual dark skinned southeast asian 21 year old child.
only for virtue signaling and internet points
@psychedelic fox  this show is going to be like santa inc. complete garbage  virtue signaling and overall trashy story telling
@psychedelic fox  have you ever heard of a bait and switch cuz thats what youre defending. you want them to draw people in to watch scooby doo characters  and then when the characters are completely different ypu expect people to just enjoy it when thats not what they fucking came there for in the first place. thats like being told youre getting pizza for dinner and youre handed a plate of spaghetti
@psychedelic fox  wow thats a lot of wordsto bad Im not going to read them
@brock johnson  yeah im not even a white guy and I have had 0 issues and infact find race changing white characters fucking dumb. im tired of it  these big corporations would sooner give us race swapped characters than just making actual characters from different backgrounds and races. like as funny as this sounds its legit just giving us the sloppy seconds of white characters. but ofc tons of people celebrate this stuff for giving us more diversity when more diversity would really be leaving all the white centric shows  characters alone and just making entirely new shows or even spin offs  movies and characters from different backgrounds. its worse in super hero movies  cause they re are legit tons of minority super heroes that dont get movies or any representation all because its easier to race swap characters
@psychedelic fox  Imean  when the established characters were pitched in 50 years ago  they were unpopular and experimental. spider-man is an example  although I know by my mention of time it doesnt add up. so making new stories until one sticks is always an option. the japanese do it all the time and itsort of works.
oh noo
@psychedelic fox  unknown characters  if they have been around for 60ish years  then how are they not known  everyone ive met knows the oc scooby-doo design. this is not about race  we simply want the original ones because we grew up with them.
scooby already deconstructed its own tropes for fun plots. sometimes these things became permanent parts of the show.
@psychedelic fox  so if someone doesnt clarify their statement enough for you  thatsomehow then means you get to mind-read your own interpretation into their statement  youre not engaging honestly.
@psychedelic fox  also  I read your 2nd comment and its all just one big strawman. its dishonest of you to reduce every given person s opposition to the remake down to racism bigotry. also  if the raceswapping thing is just a typical part of marketing and avoiding unpopularity of otherwise original characters  then why did velma comment about judy jetson being white in the trailer  why did mindy kaling state separately that all of the characters except for fred  dont have to be defined by their whiteness   what does that have to do with anything that you ve been saying
@psychedelic fox  and hanna-barbera has a whole library of scooby clones that features multi-ethnic mystery solvers that networks were afraid of in the 70 s. to the point that cbs actually told hb to  dumb valerie brown down  because they were scared of her being smart...because she was black. most scooby fans know about this and they could have made the show about the diverse clones instead and done something with that by mixing and matching similar older characters in a new way.dee dee skyes from teen angels is the most well known aside from the neptunes  biffadd susan chan from chan clangillie from ghost chasers and boo the cat from phunky phantomthere an actual pre-existing diverse new scooby-esque crew that is not the scooby crew. too bad no one at wb thought of that line up.
@psychedelic fox  race swapping had been used as a marketing tactic before and the characters besides fred dont look the same and scooby doo isn t even in it the show could be good or it might bomb Im not sure but the fact that the only way they could even attempt at succeeding is by changing something thats already popular instead of taking a risk with something new is sad
@psychedelic fox  the original show was original and new and a risk cause people hadn t heard of it yet but people liked itso they kept making it cause of its positive reception and the money it made mainly because of scooby doo they kept expanding on and ip in different ways while keeping some things the same  this new show is being talked about but its mostly negative and people dont like it for how much it changed but to companies all publicity is good publicity and people will watch anyway so I guess it doesnt matter
@psychedelic fox  if they wanted a new show with representation and mystery they should have taken the risk like the original scooby doo and made their own original show if they cant handle it possibly being disliked as a copy then they should be more creative or keep trying like everyone else
was just about to say that
@psychedelic fox  its not racist its just annoying that my dude fred is goin to cheer camp and being made into a sissy boy when he s always been a strong good hearted dude. he s like the dude that could be popular but kicks it with his own group of outcasts. Im a huge fan maybe a little obsessive haha its still just a show tho but I dont like what they doin to a show with a flawless record in my book
I like good change with scooby do kinda like the live action movie  scooby-doo on zombie island  or mystery incorporated all examples of elevating the original formula
dude the amount times daphne has come in clutch is insane lol
@raximus3000  its almost as if the people writing these shows were the types to get bullied  but never wanted to better themselves. they just held onto envy and hatred  and found a release in hurting other people.maybe they were bullies themselves.
@psychedelic fox  lmao im not even agree nor have a reading comprehension. your the one thats being hostile and insulting people for not liking the lackluster  creative  direction of a 50 year old. though since your saying that its okay to mess and change the complete personality and color of a beloved character youd be fine with the black panther being white  mulan being hispanic or pocahontas being slavic. Imean those characters are 50 years old or more. Imean its not like your gonna have a double standard now are ya
@ravenwolf fenrirson  man y all giving this person too much attention when all she doing is  bring some half ass overused twitter arguing logic  dude just said the gal who made this show is a talentless hack and she read an entirely different thing lol  thats the get go to not take her seriously not feed her attention at all.
@psychedelic fox  people can dislike someone else s work without it being about their race. they didn t bring up race but you did  youre the only one who s actually being racist here
mindy kaling is also the one who straight up talked about sexually assaulting a costar on  conan I think  and then joked about how she told her staff shed fire them if they said anything. imagine for a moment if you will....
@psychedelic fox  we are the potential customers of the product. even if the writers dont want us to be the target audience  we are still the target audience. if a business is producing a product the the consumers  in this case the audience  does not like  then the cunsumers will not give their money to the business. basic economics. I pray you grow some common sense  child
@sergio  but when they do it its a power move like tf
@psychedelic fox  Im african american and native american and sorry but stuff like this isn t how I want representation. I dont want to lift myself up by putting others down. and if I want representation why is it I have to be happy with someone else s sloppy seconds. we ve shown we can make successful shows and films with our own original characters  but people just want to focus on race swapping others. and you know what if someone feels that the only way they can connect to a character is for the character to be the same race as them  then maybe their the one who is racist. there s so much more to people than the color of their skin. and let s be real  a lot of these race swaps are happening so the people behind the shows can get brownie points for being woke while also using it as a shield to throw out any valid criticism as people being racist. these people do not care about us  they care about making money.
@psychedelic fox  I think people are upset because mindy kahling is basically making velma into a self insert character and ignoring how the gang acts completely
@psychedelic fox  if its so racist explain to me y no one cared when she was latino because it felt like it was somewhere along the character they cant just change the characters race and expect everyone to be okay with it
fred is a leader who comes up with ways to catch the creature on the fly and also has most commanding presence  while also being brawn of the groupdaphne while also competent physically in most iterations like she is a black belt  also acts as a voice of reason due to her being from higher class background as while velma is smart and fred is good as a leader they are socially bit daft in comparasion. not to mention sometimes her feminine traits literally save the day as she is very knowledgable on brands and even can recreate finger prints.shaggy and scooby are the two who are like the lucky charm of the group as they often end up by accident helping to piece together the mystery and are valued for essentially being the heart of the group.
its not fun to watch mindy kaling play mindy kaling in anything shes in.
@psychedelic fox  why do people like you gotta make everything about race
@psychedelic fox  how am I racist  because I  as a black man dont want shaggy to be black
@psychedelic fox  leave it to the white woman to dictate what is and isn t racist to a black
@psychedelic fox   oh I would agree just changing the race of a character isn t racist. but the intent behind it can be. so can peoples reactions to a race swap. I never said this show itself is racist  I wouldn t know that until I watch it. I just brought up how some people act like the only thing relatable about a character is their skin tone. also arguing on race swapping characters  saying a characters race shouldn t matter then in the same breath arguing thats its great for race representation is contradicting. you cant have your cake and eat it too. either it matters or it doesnt. and Imean by all means argue what you believe  but you started arguments about people being racist under a comment thatsaid nothing about race.  youre pointing fingers for making assumptions but you started it. and hey I cant speak for others but I think its great to talk to people who dont agree with you. having our ideas challenged is how we grow. its why I try to understand both sides. my goal isn t to change your mind or to prove that your wrong and Im right. my goal is to understand a different perspective  while sharing my own.
@psychedelic fox  yet you gloss over the fact that the creators are hypocrites when watching the scene where velma sends a death threat. there was no reason to change the mystery gang s race and literal black people find the change racist and stereotypical. Imean look at their designs and look at their interpretations of the characters  personality. at least that is what the asians and black people said. if they had made someone hispanic  I am hispanic myself  I would absolutely explode in rage  but luckily not so the remarks of racism are limited to people in those communities.
@psychedelic fox  Imay not be a mind-reader but the creators make it damn clear they know what they re doing. the protagonist  velma herself  disagrees with changing a character s race. they want to cause drama so more people watch it on hbo. so I am planning to use clips on youtube or just forget about it and not watch it at all.also the universe is giant and you think youre important  look at you! so full of yourself and calling me egotistical! at least I admit I can be selfish  so forgetful that it makes stupid  and an overall terrible person. not to mention you cant even keep an argument straight. calling me egotistical while telling me to get a self-esteem. wish your confidence came with some logic. thank you for entertaining me with your stupid arguments.
@psychedelic fox  forcing stuff on people tends to go wrong at times maybe forcing representation by changing the races of characters and saying there more diverse or better now could end up backfiring
@psychedelic fox  how many scooby doo shows did you watch
@psychedelic fox  I thought ppl just didn t like it cuz there was literally no reason too but ok
@psychedelic fox  there are racist people who dont like it but not all
she needs to be cancelled altogether
totally! in what s new scooby doo she is pretty much a mcguyver but with make up tools  it was awesome. not...this thing!
really...I was expecting him to be in the closet or trans
@rush alias  I too was thinking he would be gay
fred is definitely going to be the punching bag of the show.which is disgusting as fred is my favorite next to scooby.
@rush alias  given the description of him he might still secretly be trans
@red ram  yeah...sad
@rush alias  its not to late. I wouldnt be surprised if he has a redemption arc and to forgive his  sins  as a white person he comes out trans...or some silly shit that only makes sense to the writers and to no normal human
@elegante  thats probably season two.
the movies mocked some of the tropes in a funny way iirc the live movie did that a bit but it was in good fun. then again I think the live action movie was actually really well done.
people actually thought that fred was creep for going with two girls  seriously! people do realize thatsignificant part of comedy was monster of the day chasing shaggy and scooby and that fred needed to be absent for this  Imean  fred  velma and daphne were more of a side characters to the titular duo- at least initially. of course they needed to move somewhere else from star duo.
fred never went for the girls. he had a mutual  healthy. romantic relationship with women who liked him. he never once made a move  or made fun of them. he liked them  they liked him  so they decided to have a relationship. thats it.
@mr middlestone  fred made moves on daphne  and even when they broke up they remained friends in almost every continuity it happened. but he was never a creep or didnt understand tp
@dantheman1998  which is sad. I remember when villains use to be things that made sense.sadists  greedy  prideful  amoral people.heck some of the best villains were people who had no qualms about who they hurt and could care less about the heroes and such frivolous things.Imiss the old villains that didn t care if it was man woman or child they d do their worse regardless and were always om top of thingseven in scooby doo...the best villains didn t even bother with mystery inc. they just stumbled on them.
@scott edge  let s make sure there is no season two..
@rush alias  he will have been if they had not made shaggy black since you know who are you going to make fun of if not the straight cis white guys
usually it was shaggy  scooby and daphne who would be key pieces in the catching while fred and velma did the getting clues and building machines bit...but everyone found a clue at least once. in later years daph would protect everyone with her mits and her purse.
you dont think they actually watched the show do you
@strenif strecs  of course not. now where s sherrif....bronson stone  when you actually need him
@will n  they probably defunded him lol
@b.w productions ... oof!
bruh what they mean  fortunately he was  wrongly imprisoned
true  it kinda explains why they are fetishizing underage characters  its all kalings weird disturbing fan fic.
how could somebody know what it is like being a white person in a white society if they re not white  isn t that a bunch of racist assumptions  I dont know what its like to be a man  Ive never been a man. I have never met all the men in the world either  so I can only speak to the men Ive interacted with and my own very limited life experiences. there are 7 billion people on the planet..I hate that people seem to think thatsomehow their own limited experience gives them the right to either speak for all people or to cram another entire group of people into a stereotype box  and what s worse  a sexist racist stereotype box at that. it borders on insanity.
I get the feeling that mindy kaling is exactly like her character in the office.  a thirty something perpetual child  constantly seeking validation from teenage boys.
exactly. he treated everyone like equals. even scrappy  when he was on the team.
just take a close look at everything across entertainment the last few years.they seem determined..to destroy or replace every iconic straight white character or hero we ever loved for decades!
@supersonicwarrior93  he never berated them unless scooby-doo and shaggy are slacking off over food. fred was always been the trapmaster of the team in every visbile series he is in.
@michael quaid  I dunno about destroy but replace them. Imean they try and really try and when sales dont work for them because majority of the consumers aren t interested  you back to basics.
@ashura  Im just saying its happening all over the place. for 30 years we ve had a white redhead named ariel the mermaid.but not anymore!heck  even snow white isn t going to be white anymore. and her whole thing is about  skin as white as snow  so I think its quite obvious what the agenda is
good job gang   we couldn t have done it if we didn t work together   -fred
great work  gang!
yeah youre right he would always say  great job gang  and stuff like that.
absolutely. fred was a good leader because he was the bravest. not because he was white or well off or anything else. he was the one to grab the bull by the horns and lead the charge.
@michael quaid  jhonny quest and hadjI are the homosexual couple in the jellystone series.
literally a great leader
maybe thats why anime becomes more and more popular. cause they dont do this shit.
@the yodeling viking  I just read the first issue of the dc comics robin series  they have already turned tim drake into a 100  stereotyped homosexual with a handsome boyfriend  tossed away 30 years developing the character of tim drake as the heir to batman  he went from being an alpha male to a pretty little flower. and you wonder why the western comic is going to hell
exactly fred was a incredibly nice and supportive of everyone  the worst thing you can say about fred was he was clueless that daphne liked him in later cartoons.
@brock johnson  yeah when shaggy and scooby didn t want to be bait  he had bribe them to do it.
only one time. that was the first live action movie with the demon possession pyramid thing. that was the only time it had ever happened and obviously he learned his lesson in time for the second movie. and remember  that team also made scrapy piss on daphnee and  spoiler alert  the villain of the movie.... I cant believe that film was actually more respectful of the characters than this velma slop.
@ashura  more often than not it was daphne or velma bribing scooby and shaggy with scooby snacks... go watch the cartoon a few times so you know what youre talking about
@michael quaid  there making a new snow white movie
@audrey harris  wasn t that made already at this point  if not  waste of cash.
@the yodeling viking  100  its also because those writers and artists compete for publication in shounen jump and the like. so only the best stuff gets shone out and made into anime. these companies have too much money now and are throwing it down the drain  they also probably dont care as long they re getting  the message  across.
@zarach  good thing there is plenty other good comics that I can read  and probably would last me my lifetime .
@audrey harris  didn t you know  disney is preparing its version of snow white with a colombian protagonist and no dwarfs  no joke.
and let s not forget that fred  taking credit for everyone else work  makes no sense fred always congratulates the whole group after catching the villain even tho he came up with the plan that caught the bad guy.
@zarach  the made jabberjaw into a girl too  right  like almost half of the hb characters
this
@titan g  that one Im actually fine with...it helps distinguish it more from the scooby josie jetsons undersea-clone sea.
@snowmon89  Im glad someone mentioned this. I think most of the gang was a little off in that movie but Im guessing it was partly done for the sake of parody
@ashura  and now shaggy is the weedmaster!
old school fred was a chad
@michael quaid  coming from a black man fred was really important to me growing up the entire scooby gang was cool because a jock  pretty girl  smart girl   the stoner and his dog.
@olajuwon spears  I hear you and I appreciate your comments. I dont know why they want to destroy beloved characters that have been around for decades.it cant be that hard to make original characters with new stories. thats why I think there s another agenda in play.Imean what else am I supposed to think right and to me you could never ever replace shaggy!Imean goodness my favorite characters were scooby and shaggy running off scared making giant sandwiches. lol!and why not just start all new story and crew starting scrappy-doo! thatseems reasonable
@zarach  seriously  how does that work  her looks are the entire plot  her skin is white as snow and the queen is pissed thatshes fairer than her. my mind is blown right now.
@charg1nmalaz0r  snow white will be latina  there will be no dwarfs  there will be no prince and snow white will not look for her love  it will be a story of female empowerment  this is what disney executives have said and I never cease to be amazed at their stupidity  for that they could simply do a original story of a princess who fights against the evil stepmother and ends up giving a feminist and misandric speech  but if I do  I dont think anyone will pay money to see it  instead with the title of snow white they will attract some unwary people.
@zarach  at that point it would probably be easier to make a new story right
bro the gang could crash his van into his home and he would thank them for the van crash data that the streets can be save
@the yodeling viking  thats the reason why all of us are going to anime.they dont give a shit about woke politics.
@michael quaid  okay the ariel thing is ridiculous. its one thing to emasculate  completely change the way characters behave or think and then its another to make a character another race can relate to. there s no agenda behind that. they do it all the time in different countries we just happen to be a different race sharing the same country. your racism is showing
I thought it was usually using shaggy and scooby as the bait and they granted screwed up the plan but still got the villain
@markmagician2  good point. counter argument  there is no shaggy or scooby in this show. shaggy s been replaced by a black dude named vashonne or some sh t. meanwhile  scooby s been completely thanos snapped.
cuties has no defense.
@sarmad habib khan  they used shaggy s real name norville for this show
shaggy got turned into nappy
dahmer is fine  I watched before the hype
why dahmer  I haven t seen it but Im well aware of his crimes.
@andrew silva  because they re glorifying dahmer while portraying the victims in a negative light. also  his victims never consented to being depicted in this show in any capacity nor were they informed. also also  the gay people are mad about this show being enlisted in the gay category on netflix. also also also  a lot of jackasses on tiktok are making romantic tiktoks about dahmer and how hot he looks apparently  cuz thats a thing this generation does for some reason . so yea  there s a lot of things wrong with this show.
@sarmad habib khan  I dont really see how you could portray someone who had sex with body parts in a positive light  I would have to see the show to really have an opinion on that  and I dont see how you cantake thatstance if you haven t seen it  either. the rest of it doesnt mean a whole lot though. you cant really consent to something when you ve been murdered  and when it comes to the survivors  I dont think you need consent to depict events that are a matter of public record  otherwise anything true crime related would be in hot water. dahmer was gay and so were most of his victims so categorizing it as such makes sense to me. the tiktok thing is just a modern version of the many women who have sent love letters to serial killers in prison  including dahmer  thats not the fault of the show.
dont forget masters of the universe
dahmer wasn t bad. except for certain messages
@sarmad habib khan   if you actually watched dahmer I d be surprised if you came away with the conclusion that its glorifying dahmer and putting down the victims. its quite the opposite. go watch it ffs.
@sarmad habib khan  this sounds like youread a news article about the families being outraged by netflix not notifying them about dahmer  thought to yourself  wow thats horrible the victims never consented to being in the show!  and took all of it as the show is romanticizing dahmer.
@alita  no my problem with the show is that it highlights dahmer the serial killer and his entire narrative instead of taking time to pay attention to his actual victims. plus when you dont even ask for the victims  families for their consent before portraying a show about the killer who killed their loved ones in gruesome fashion then I automatically have an issue with the show and its creators
@sarmad habib khan   you are insufferable. once again  if you go watch the show  half of it is about the victims  the justice system  police incompetence and prejudice  exploitation immediately following the arrest  nature vs nurture.you clearly haven t watched it. you have no bases to talk about it. I hope you dont always form opinions this quickly and by taking other people s word for things.
wdym cuties was a really good show
@sarmad habib khan  the lack of consent from the people affected is truly immoral and a legit reason to not watch the movie. but everything else you ve said  either doesnt have anything to do with the movie  like the tiktoks  that is just the stupidity of a few individuals  or is just plain wrong  since the movie doesnt depict dahmer in a good light or the victims in a bad one as you claimed. also  I would just like to add that young people glorifying serial killers is not this generation s things  its been around since serial killers began to get publicity. the girls swooning over ted bundy were pretty far from gen z.
@andrew silva  exactly! the show didn t romanticize his crimes or focused on how hot he looks  dahmer irl is not hot its just the actor   it was actually quite horrific and often an upsetting watch as each episode progressed. its even more upsetting that there was another serial killer in there who made a  cameo  making it an even more uncomfortable watch than it already is
@manager homu  its sad because shaggy hates his real name. if the shaggy had a 4th wall subconscious he d be living in hell.
@tyr  lmao but mindy kailing wanted to be more  progressive  she failed btw
@sarmad habib khan  its not just this generation if you actually look into it alot of generations do this specifically females they got some weird mental issues but you go to to blame generations purely on assumptions is ignorant
@manager homu  thats cool and  but we can still have shagy
@sarmad habib khan  actually the  females finding people like him hot  thing is seen for generations now  its more common in females itseems but you can find evidence of males doing the same thing such with that japan s yandere girl who stabbed her boyfriend and guys were making fan art and such... its just a certain percent of the population are into killers  sociopaths  and psychopath  on the sociopaths and psychopaths Imean specifically the ones that kill  most dont kill and you probably know one without even knowing  you could be one yourself and not know!
Imean there s not much to miss they still do extra movies of the same kinda style every year take this in more as that other experimental spin off like shaggy and scoobydoo get a clue but the bad velma edition
yeah its absolutely terrible. though luckily velma is supposed to be an adult show so kids wont see this
@ insertunoroginalnamehere   some kids will definitely see this  I dont know about you but I was watching stuff I wasn t supposed to as soon as I had access to the internet at like 8-10  years old.
@nessa  ok good point
p0
thats what Im saying.daphne never acted ditsy she was feminine fashion icon and really brought things together like glue.the fact they have her covered by bubbles alone is disgusting and they are the ones to talk about hypersexulization of female characters but do some hypocrite shit like this!
@fleeky lady  exactly. I dont know why so many people are scared of very feminine girls.
agreed
also pretty clear none of them actually watched scooby doo and instead read quick summary about it.
its hilarious. I think the trailer was funny it upset people while being cringe.
@mars oblivi0n  when was the funny part ........
white guy take
they hate themselves and project.
@president uwu  did you just assume their race  thats pretty racist
they also hate earth.
how many people angry about this give a shit about scooby doo  sure I watched it as a kid but I certainly dont care about it now  but I just wasn t aware that the show had such a large adult fanbase.
@venusian blivet  watching something that was such a large part of your childhood being destroyed by someone who doesnt even care about the franchise is upsetting people   thats shocking
the woke in general hate fans who are loyal to the original content.
@president uwu  Im black and I agree with his take
@president uwu  white guy take   great take
@president uwu  careful  your bigotry  and subsequent hypocrisy  is showing.
they even changed the town name from coolsvill to poortown.
@venusian blivet  the new show doesnt seem to be for kids either.
as a asian I normally dont like saying this but I feel offended that they are not normalizing our race and forcing it.
as a huge scooby-doo fan this is such a let down already
@logans revenge  its fine it isn t for kids but that doesnt mean itshould trash on the fans who watched it their entire life. it also could still have scooby doo and be for adults
@statesminds  I agree. I was referring to the comment  that it was a kids show so why are adults upset about it.
personally I took that as a self-aware little nod  its probably one of the few things they got right
they did say that he is the only one defined by his  whiteness .
character s race are either swapped or completely ruin purposely.
what about the alien invaders movie that was great I wish the alien characters came back or the vampire rock scooby doo movie.
that was my favorite movie
zombie island  the vampire one  and cyber chase are all goated
fred does not have daddy issues. fred s father turned out to not be his real father and then his real father and mother tried to kill him now they re dead because he s a leader. the only issue fred ever had was when daphne stop talking to him and started dating another person and he was so broken he became a wandering hobo for like six months. please keep in mind all of this is from mystery inc. which was a completely different take and is questionable if its part of the canon or not depending on if you enjoy the last episode.
@miller s meat locker  tbh that does kinda sound like daddy issues
@digest     thats just my point its not canon all of these things they try to say is off of one show that is clearly different than everything else
iirc in the old cartoon and some of the comics daphne is a competent martial artist and threw the beat down a few times.
but fred was a person who takes all credit to himself right
@batman  the only time he did that was in the first live action movie. but that was meant to be a parody or spoof and wasn t meant to follow the original and instead play around with the original s dynamic.
@austin lawrence  and even then he stops doing that by the end
@batman  using scooby-doo the movie as an example is invalid. that project went through development hell. it was written as a parody. thats why the characters are dicks to each other. they retooled it to be a straight faced scooby movie  but left remnants of the original plan in.
so now feminism  and inclution  have the fault actually yes.
adults love reading things in to kids shows that were never there.   oh daphne used to team up with fred when they went searching for ghosts  so they must have been an item.   no  it was an asexual show and what you saw on screen was all there was to it.  nothing more.
like they ve been close friends since childhood there was a whole series pup named scooby doo yo
@silver soul user  true.
also  what is the problem about a guy not hitting puberty early on  why should they shame this  what is wrong with these people
I still find the  they ruined gay velma by making her attracted to a guy  thing hilarious. they portrayed the way she s always been and was intended to be  yet thats the part that  ruined  her
how do you take one of the most wholesome himbo characters put to television  completely destroy him and think to your self  this is a good idea.
fortunately  fred is wrongly imprisoned for murders he didn t commit. hold up. fortunately ! not  unfortunately   are they going to celebrate fred going to prison too
I cried tears of joy when fred washed the bedsheets when velma and daphne finished scissoring  so brave
the entire description of fred  and how he  quickly realizes her thoughts and emotions have value   reads like fanfiction therapy for a woman who couldn t get a chad to commit to her.
fred   he quickly realizes her  velma  thoughts have high value. while trying to totally throw fred under the bus they point out a positive leadership trait by accident.
isn t all of hollywood riddled with perverts    ...spot on melonie  spot on.  woody allen  harvey weinstein  roman polanskI  the list goes on and on.  these people are so out of touch and they still think the general public wants to and should listen to them and take their advice.
it really made me tear up with joy when velma looked at the pizza delivery guy and said  two in the jinkies  one in the stinkie . so stunning  so brave.
let s see 1.- they create a series for adults based on a cartoon that is 50 years old and that all adults loved in their childhood.2.- they change all the characters to such an extent that they are only related to the originals because they use the same name.3.- they insult the fans who claim to be their target.what could go wrong
they are perverted and disgusting. -melonie mac go boom  2022
when bringing scrappy doo back isn t the worst idea anymore.
fred did come up with the plans right  he set up the traps and told the scooby gang which directions to go in. he was the leader for a reason. velma may have found the clues but  the bad guys always got caught in his traps.
the only version of fred which was a douche and takes credit for others work was in the first live action movie. and that idea started out as a parody of the original or something similar I seem to remember reading about could have been wrong   but in every other version of scooby doo  fred is a damn stand up guy. befitting of his title and position of leader. I just dont get where all the hate for the characters of scooby doo is coming from. this and the disrespect to both scooby and fred is just sad. maybe its because the guy who voice fred also voices scooby  so both gets a huge amount of disrespect.
fred was the leader. always having a plan no matter what the circumstances.daphne was the confident fighter. she constantly squared off with enemies and beat them. she s canonically known to be a black belt karate. in addition to thatshe s an expert lock picker  which has also been shown numerous times in the old and new shows by picking locks with her hairpins.velma was obviously the lead detective on the squad. quickly putting plots together and figuring out who the culprit is. she also was blatantly heterosexual because she secretly openly had a crush on shaggy.shaggy and scooby were obviously the comic relief that kept the squad from taking themselves too seriously.
I seem to remember in the 90s. we aged down the scooby gang with a pup named scooby doo! that was still a fun mystery show!
I honestly wanted to cry and break my phone watching the trailer with the words about not changing a good thing. thats exactly what they are doing.
honestly Im not surprised. as soon as mindy said that fred was the only character who was  obviously white   I knew they were going to pull something like this.
poor children cant have a normal childhood anymore. I used to love these characters and I still do but I wish kids could have the same experience I and many others had with these shows.btw I loved the way you approached this whole thing  good job!
fred s always been depicted as a solid guy.
shag... you and scoob go down this dark scary tunnel and find the monster first.  me and the girls will go this way... to  look for clues .  yeah  thats it.   probably one of the longest running jokes in the series.
lol for real he was the only person that would ask for her opinion because he knew she was smarter than him and that this was her expertise he never said he was the smartest one he took credit because he was the leader everybody knew he was the leader he fucking drove the van they literally listen to his instructions and he s the one thatsets up the traps and everything
@gary m  ikr they were all a bunch of kids just going out  solving mysteries and having a good time
@ex john vibe   till the woke attacked and now they all became stereotypes.
even when her plans were insane  or they went wrong. fred was still like  alright. let s give this another shot. let s go.
@sergio  bruh its crazy super rare odd not hit puberty by 16 normal for boys 9 to 14.its a major slam to do that to any man
seriously whenever she spoke they trusted her implicitly regardless of what anyone else said.
@richard rabe  I agree. thats why I am saying that its not something to make fun of
@sergio  I know just add to it.
@batman  fred was the most positive and optimistic guy in the whole group. gave credit where it was due and acted like he d never be able to do it without his valuable team members.
hell they they all agreed thatshe literally carrys the whole gang with her intellect.
she is literally the one that wrapped up all the mysteries.
fr though  why does a character have to be completely gay for others to accept them as representation  what s so wrong about a character being bI  pan or poly
wouldn t surprise me
my mind is disturbed
exactly. its literally revenge of the nerds
@james kozy  one could even argue thatshe s being an incel.  but when its a woman  she gets to claim she just has standards and blame men for it.
thats all modern writing is  mediocre people who never truly struggled wanting constant validation from everyone around them
@bryan woods  its funny  cause if a man uses the same talking points  he d be considered an incel
the difference being that most such fellows are self-aware enough to not put that out there in established media but tend to keep it to the fanfiction sites.and the few cringey oddballs that dont tend to not get their way anyway because other guys will gatekeep the franchise from thatshit.when a woman does thatsame cringey shit the guys cant gatekeep without being blamed for being misogynist or some kind of -phobe.
self insert of mindy kaling
@james kozy  revenge of the spinsters more like. she-hulk did it too.
oooff haha so true
facts
dont mess with bitter  ugly  lonely women over 30. its not a pretty sight and they know it. they know it and they will make you pay for it.
fred was genuinely a good guy. his only flaw is getting caught up in his own traps  usually for comic effect  but he is a decent leader. daphne got carried away with her makeup and such  but she was intelligent  and she did care for people. they had personality from 60s to 2010s. to be honest  I did not mind the scream type trailer  but the dialogue was definitely cringy. and the raceswaps are lazy. there have been diverse characters throughout the eras. the creators try to act as if the audience hates diverse characters even though the hate is because of the personalities and unnecessary raceswaps which is merely to antagonise the audience. they also claim  it is for the younger generation  which means very little considering I watched stuff from the 90s and 80s despite being born in  98 as a child. I can still watch certain children stuff as they have competent storylines which can be better than some adult teenage shows which I find puzzling. even with censorship on comics and such  they managed to make good content. the original rugrats still holds up with the animation style and storylines. one of which is where angelica nearly had a brother and itseemingly hinted at a miscarriage or at least itseemed that way. the show is also full of racism and such whilst complaining about it. would adults or children be interested in this
fr
@bryan woods  woman were the first incels. that is who started the movement. it became a slur used against men  but woman can be and many are incels.
@andy stegall  is being white  male  and Christian in america like the last hundred years of writers a struggle  the privileged complaining that others didn t struggle is one of the funniest things Ive ever read.
its literally just her character from the office  which she apparently also wrote for. seems like a pattern for her
@mk v2  youre aware most people have a pretty consistent sense of humor  right  a tina fey show is unmistakable from any other show for anyone who s watched any two of her shows. ryan murphy and taika waititI are other good examples.
especially considering this version of velma is a self-insert of the creator.
oh God it is exactly that. holy shit!
Imean thats most likely mindy right lmfao and she used that as an excuse to speed her bullshit rhetoric everywhere right
@james kozy  more like revenge on the nerds  for a train wreck womans heartbreak from a chad
@nemesis the slasher   the show is gonna be a trainwreck  but a creative way I personally think some entertainment value could be salvaged is  by forcing a race and gender swap of fred s character while keeping their current script. for me it would be so funny seeing the anti-white male demonising completely miss  and be aimed at hispanic woman for example. an ironic way to defeat evil.
@jack gerrity  perhaps but this should have been decent if done real talent. Imean it could have been like the harley quinn show where it is somewhat mature and does things with the characters are not given enough development. I also do not get the fascination with making velma a lesbian. those who push dor itseem to focus on her clothing.they also want her to be asian because she is clever. Imean these people complain about racial stereotypes and yet that is all they canthink of for shows. in rugrats  they made one of the mothers into a lesbian and removed her husband. the new writer claimed that the mother is a butch lesbian. in reality  she was just a strong character who spoke up the most and was a caring mother wife but she also did her own stuff. most of the mothers and fathers on the show worked and looked after their children. the original had decent writing and the characters were interesting. one of the few shows for children that had an actual plot instead of the same generic story arc.
@james kozy  not revenge of the nerds. nerds have more taste.
get out and take my like
the scrappy hatred is manufactured
@helder oliveira  I didnt even know people hated him back then I only found out recently from a video I watched
@kingkilla 777  people always hated him
@markmagician2  I hated the blue puppet in sesame street  I never had feelings for scrappy.
scrappy would be a savage to this group lol. he would beat em all up.
they dont even have scooby  how will they bring back scrappy
@doug d  just let him at  em
@doug d  factsits scooby dooless
fred came up with the capture plans  made the traps  and always listened to other people s ideas  daphne  shaggy  and scooby usually found the clues and acted as bait  and velma figured out how all the clues fit together
@diabeto12   let me at  em  let me at  em  come on daphne let s show them why we re both black belts  scrappy  for once I agree  Im done with this  and I need to call a canary.
give me scrappy doo then that garbage.
make shaggy a transgender and make shaggy thicc  make velma and daphne super skinny  and make fred a buff goth. also make an adult version of scrappy doo be the main character.  call the show scrap.
@skitdora2010  cookie monster or grover
lol
he s gonna be norville s pitbull companion
idk is this show worse than scrappy doo or is scrappy doo worse than this show  personally I think this show might be worse since its grown adults making minors look badscrappy doo is just some annoying little character
oh they ll make the scrapster much worse Im sure.
@arnaghad_the_ox  im pretty sure people would love to see that then this garbage they are making
a scrappy doo solo series would be better then what we got
when will they bring back scoobie dum
heeeeeeyy!!! I ll have you know that I like scrappy doo!
we need scrappy chad.
bahahaha
scrappy is a saint compared to these atrocities.
Im glad they didn t add scooby doo to this. it would be incredibly disrespectful. at least since he isn t in this show I cantake it as not scooby doo
@markmagician2  thats not true fake fan Ive always loved scrappy and I never heard anyone hating scrappy when I was growing up all of you scrappy doo haters are just fake fans and dog haters
loved thatshow with fred always thinking it was that red haired kid I cant think of his name lol damn good cartoon
@itcustom  his name was red herring.  but I loved thatshow too!
@clive mercer  haha  thanks for the name they dont make good cartoons like that anymore lol
so a stereotype
@peronkop  Imean they were all stereotypes but hanna barbara did the stereotypes very well
@peronkop  in today s media  yeah.
fred and daphne kinda look like japanese anime.
look how they massacred my boy
they said he was the  only one defined by their whiteness.
I thought they would just make him a pompous buffoon  but this is just sick.
they ll probably make him gay or trans. maybe give him a sex change by the seasons end.
@megamax  that the thing they did they did him wrong twice not only did they give the dumb chad treatment but they no balled him too 16 years has not hit puberty age rage for that 9 threw 14 for every boy
I figured they d turn him into a woke punching bag and they did not disappoint.
@richard rabe  and its all somehow connected to his uninfringeable whiteness. they said he s overcompensating for his lack of manhood. its all connected.
so they re assuming the dog as white
@rogue raccoon  usually they were celebrity parodies. this one is dobie gillis specifically combined with the radio drama I love a mystery.fred is dobieshaggy is krebsvelma is zeldadaphne is thalia.thatshow also confirmed who ultimately gets with who too.fred gets velma.shaggy gets daphne.
something racist pretty much
@brian smith  probably the latter. the only reason I canthink of for why someone wouldn t have even started puberty by age 16 is that they re on puberty blockers to stop the physical changes that come with it.
I would have made fred black instead of shaggy honestly. I think people would have cared a little less.
@cc  no its still an arbitrary change to an established character  people aren t going to like it regardless of who gets the race swap. especially when they re trying to brand this series as a prequel.
@rogue raccoon  hanna barbara has some s class cartoons one of the biggest reason for the kickstart of cartoon networks success. amazing cartoons
in the original source material  fred is not a credit grabber. he s a great leader who always congratulates his team for solving a mystery. he s a fine gentleman who s willing to take risk for his team.he only became one  credit-grabber  because of james gunn in the live-action film. because fred is almost this perfect guy which makes him a little bland  gunn felt the need to add depth in him as he couldn t find the flaw in fred s character aside from his faulty traps. but of course  that behavior didn t last long. it was only to set up the story of how they would grow apart. in other iterations  they made fred be a himbo  which I am not a fan of  because he never was. and now  this emasculating him for woke agenda  God  Imiss those days when the mystery inc was just doing it for the mystery. they re already dynamic and diverse in their own way.
when I was a kid  scooby doo was my favorite cartoon. I always thought that they were adults  never saw them as teenagers because how could kids be driving around solving mysteries  oh  and I also believed that velma was shaggy s girl
what s stupid about this is that the whole gang were equally loved by all audiences. some had their personal favorites  but the gang is like a family. these writers are going out of their way to destroy an iconic franchise due to their own malice.
out of all the animated shows that hbo max just canned out of nowhere its actually mind boggling that this one somehow survived
these people never watched the original series  and if they did they clearly dont remember it because they dont know who fred is at all. there s a reason fred is such a beloved character  because he was such a genuinely nice guy. he never took credit for someone else s work and always made sure his team knew that they could succeed in their parts of the plan. even when things went wrong  he never blamed anyone.
in the old cartoons I remembered it as this  fred made the traps  velma analyzed the clues  daphne found the clues and gave scooby snacks   shaggy and scooby were the bait and the mascots. but hey  with every iteration there was always a time that the gang got to shine  but this  this seems to be dragging the gang through the mud.
4 28 velma was their friend though thick and thin  they respected her and if you ask any of them who is the smartest one of their group they would say velma  not to say that daphne isn t also smart but its the old d d thing of wisdom vs intellect one is book smarts the other is street smarts  heck they would say she is one of the smartest people on the planet.none of them looked down on any of the others  they accepted them for who they are but nowadays your not   normal   if you dont judge everyone around you apparently.
fred is such a memorable character because he s a great example thatsomeone can be a leader without showing any toxic traits or behaving like an  alpha male . he traits everyone as equals and treasures their friendship even if they re all different. usually he s the one for the hard work and who grabs the bull by the horns  but he doesnt brag about it or makes fun of anyone. he s a natural team player and even if he gets too enthusiastic about something  he will admit when he made a mistake and make up for it.its sad that he now gets portrayed as a dumb  spoiled  immature white racist with a small dick. but I feel like its becoming a trend to bash white characters in diverse shows.
I never even thought about the  insult men for sexualing women  while  insult men for not having sex with women  narrative completely counters each other.
I had to stop halfway through because I was getting too upset  I cant believe they disrespected my boy fred like that and all the characters
definitely scared and mad too see how hbo can ruin this!!! another problem with this is that they dont have the current original actors from the tv series or the movies! I love your common sense  keep up the great work!!!!
where did all the good men go   they aren t men anymore.  oh
its so heartbreaking how they are treating fred. I always considered him the most underrated member of the gang. in the 1970s he may have been a bitstern  but later on he s more humble  lovable and funny.and I know this is going to be a different voice actor  but I also feel its a bit disrespectful towards frank welker because he voiced fred for over 50 years.
the part about him realizing her opinions have value is actually accurate to mystery incorporated  where he literally put earbuds in to avoid listening to daphne talking after a villain said it was the secret to getting women to like him  and he displayed a lot of toxic misogyny in the mystery inc version too  where he asked why he has emotions unlike other men  etc. the daddy issues thing was also very present in mystery inc. everything else is awful but that at least is based on previous versions.
fortunately  fred is wrongly imprisoned for murders he did not commit.
good point about leadership qualities.   I have this one friend that just automatically assumes that role in pretty much everything and we all love him for it.  my friend group is typically pretty easy-going so making decisions on what to do or where to go can be difficult.  I dont mind taking on a leadership role when necessary  but its never something I ll just do.
translated  much like the original fred  our  fred  is nothing like the original fred. yeah  sounds about right. . . .
Imiss the early days  mel. I really do. you are on point! sex doesnt need to be apart of all the stories. stories can be very gripping without sex. ever read  or listen to the d artagnan romances  there is absolutely no sex in any of those books  yet they convey a complex  and intriguing story.  the man in the iron mask   great story! no sexualization of any kind! yes  of course this series eludes to romantic endeavors  but its never sexualized. we need to bring back old school story telling.
he hasn t gone through puberty yet    his secret is getting harder to hide    just over-the-clothes stuff  all heavily points to him being trans. he s probably on puberty blockers and doesnt want to have sex with daphne because he s hiding he s trans from her. Im gonna assume he s female-to-male  which would explain not wanting daphne to see him naked  and since he s apparently keeping it from his dad  he probably doesnt invite people over because his dad refers to him as a girl. on the flip side I guess he could be male-to-female and hasn t started transitioning yet  and doesnt want to have sex with daphne yet because it makes him dysphoric or something. either way  it figures that the one white guy needs to be queer to complete the gold star troupe of minority main characters. Im calling it now  they ll receive backlash from the crowd they re catering to for not casting a trans va  or otherwise  misrepresenting trans folk  in some way.
all of these characters were able to overcome stereotypes and work together.
these people only have hatred in their hearts. how miserable a life they must live  to be devoid of love. they are miserable and want to make everyone else miserable.
@geeebuttersnap  well said
the gang is like a family that is why it needs to go.
evil cannot create. only corrupt.
true. I didn t hate a single member of the scooby-doo gang. except for velma in mystery incorporated  because she was just toxic with her obsession for shaggy. in fact mystery incorporated kind of botched a lot of their personalities as well.
sadly all reboots do this
Im not counting this show as cannon to the og series
@beckett  what
it wasn t me
the narrative is to insult men  no matter what.
@dabobthorton  this.  misandry is the point.  the excuse is irrelevant.
I think its just  insult men for everything   which is sometimes self-contradictory.its good to remember that men are some of the worst offenders when it comes to woke man-hating. the average woman likes men  and woke folks are harming women as well as men.
orwell called it doublethink  its what an ideologically pure follower has to do when ideology starts contradicting itself.
with saying daphne is bored with over clothes stuff is she the sex maniac character
its like those episodes in the sopranos where Christopher is being told and scolded into getting clean from whatever addictions he has  only to be insulted and belittled for not indulging in the same things that he was addicted to  to the point he relapses.
yeah. there re mostly hypocrites. their so backward that their  message  never makes sense.
@santiago451  yep. gotta love blatant double standards.
@john swain   sorry  but no. most misandry comes from women.
@cantnevercould96  he s not wrong though  there s a lot of loser dudes who self-identity as feminists and buy into all that woke nonsense  then try to enforce that on fellow dudes. its especially virulent among college guys.
those two things dont contradict each other  instead  they correlate and complement one another.
@santiago451  exactly
@mea  3   please explain how  you shouldn t sexualize women  and  youre a loser for not having sex with women  are at all correlated or complementary to one another.
@andrew silva  sure  but who do you think those guys are trying to impress
@cantnevercould96  women  of course  but its still on those dudes for buying into the ideology  even if they re doing it dishonestly.
yes we get insulted no matter what. we sit down insults. we breathe insults. we think insults
rather odd  eh
oh no  I didn t even catch that. haha! good grief!  -d jeez... oh man. Im just overwhelmed and flabbergasted by how much cringe they ve crammed into so little space.
I thought the same thing. how the heck does that work
man I was just scrolling through comments so I could find someone who picked up on that and like their comment!
they said the quiet part out loud
at age 16
ah  yes  because there is nothing better than being wrongfully convicted and  most importantly  being a minor inside an adult prison.
no matter your background  being wrongfully imprisoned and going through that kind of trauma is never okay
@phil nolan  who they made it a point to say he hasn t gone through puberty yet...
@pok mon trainer jaden        he s tall  blonde blue eyes  and a straight white male. 100  he s going to be the punching bag and the token modern  white jock asshole  character. its so predictable.
fortunately ... what the fuuuuuuu
I like to watch a anime genre called  slice of life  its usually slower and more grounded but its still super interesting and fun to watch without and sexuality in it  though some do
and remember all while doing this to a 16 year old....soooo perverted
you know what  at least we have decades of good scooby doo episodes we can go back to and enjoy.
fred never condescended to his friends regardless of how a plan goes awry  and even when he was getting onto scooby and shaggy for their reluctance he never did more than light teasing  overall taking a non-problematic character and knocking them down for no reason other than appealing to a specific crowd that will probably not even watch the show is endlessly idiotic.
I love how they said  much like the original fred  I only remember fred always splitting the team into groups and making traps thatseldom actually catch the crook.  usually shag and scoob get caught by mistake  but it was always velma who talked to the authorities at the end explaining how the criminal did itso how does fred take credit again
its really not hard to figure out scooby doo and the dynamics but somehow these writers managed to accomplish it   . wow
if someone only gave me a picture of fred from this  velma series   without any other context  I would honestly be excited. not bc he s  still  a white character  but bc he is drawn quite detailed and his expression is really good  putting aside the fact these creators want to emasculate fred .compared to the other characters with just basic lines and flat expression  there s nothing wrong with it  its just funny how the character that they want to push down was given better care in the publicity material.
its crazy how some people only see diversity in color and disregard diversity in other things that have a lot more to do with a person actual character instead of something they have no choice about. as was said in this video  the mystery squad were kids who would never hang out together or be friends but they hung out together and solved mystery s
velma - braindaphne - brawlerfred - tacticianscooby and shaggy - the comedic relief   the bait they made velma look bad and I bet whoever came up with this idea never watch scooby-doo.
wife just showed me this video. her   they re changing fred in the new scoobyless show. me   of course they are. he s a preppy white boy. how bad could it really be though  so they made fred a smu- what in the name of all that is holy ! check their hard drives!
this was my childhood and seeing this all I can do is weep and cry at what they r doing to it I dont understand what the world is coming to.
I love how hbo thinks fred  takes all the credit  for everyone else s work. they have not seen a single scooby doo episode before. dude literally doesnt do that
when did fred ever take credit  he was quick with the compliments and often times velma and shaggy got most of the credit from the secondary characters.yeah fred was the face of the group but he would always attribute success to the group as a collective.
youre saying a lot of things here that are hard to say publicly that guys go through melonie. youre a good voice for truth. and hollywood is weird.  3 your channel!
amen to the fact that you can make a  wholesome  show that also leans towards a more  mature  audience. whatever they re doing is trite  clumsy  and mean-spirited.
now its been a while since I actively watched scooby-doo but wasn t fred the one who usually came up with plans to catch the criminals while velma was the one who usually figured who was behind the mask.also fred never took credit from anyone. he always congratulated everyone for doing their part.
I think its safe to say that most  if not all  of the people involved with the show have never actually watched any scooby-doo media
fred was like that in the original   fred in mystery incorporated loved traps more than anything
this might sound weird but  melonie is exactly what I imagine velma would like if she was a real person  like the voice  the hair  attitude and everything.
reading that tweet filled me with immense disappointment and frankly left me jaw-droppedhe- he just- fred would never act like that. ever! not to mention thats just- that is not him at all! wtf!
he quickly realizes her thoughts and emotions have values  how to say you hate men without directly saying it
its like the rings of power. they make up non existent issues... fred always valued the whole team. velma was always clever. the rop shills claimed they were making tolkein more  accessible . heart breaking.
this is a the saving grace. scooby now or at least some point had more episodes than the simpsons. I would guess its more now. and most stories are faithful to the characters. even if they push this shaggy is black  velma hates men  fred is weak trope for the the next 10 years. they will never be able to touch the legacy of the original
do we
@deadschooled  youre seriously asking that
@deadschooled  the answer your looking for is clearly in the person comment that youreplied to
remember when the gta series got  remastered  and they took the better original versions off the market. this could always happen with media we watch as well if it got bad enough so you dont wanna fall back on thatsentiment
yeah  because nobody s gonna remember this absolute disgrace of a show with anything other than disdain or absolutely uncaring
@gavyn  piracy exists
@ashwin d reddy  that will always be true but it doesnt excuse companies  nintendo  from their blatant allergy to wanting money
it makes me appreciate the timeless innocence of the series. hollywood has to ruin everything.
@deadschooled  check your local library. thats how I watch the good stuff.
yep. been finding dvds of the show and keeping them for life lol.
ditto  the ones I can always look back on are the classics like the 1960 s scooby-doo  where are you  the 13 ghosts of scooby-doo  a pup named scooby-doo  2000 s what s new scooby-doo   shaggy   scooby  get a clue.but also there s the various scooby cartoon movies from those times as well but I do appreciate the 4 live action ones too.
@deadschooled  if your ass didn t see the johnny bravo and scooby-doo cross over.
@oil  the batman and robin crossover too
and they were too busy solving mysteries to worry about this nonsense.
it was her arren the woman who is voicing velma in this show basically made it
scooby and shaggy I would also say is the heart
what was scoobie dum for
wouldn t scooby doo be the face  he was always the main character
@geeebuttersnap  in universe. whenever there were authority figures or media coverage they usually spoke to freddy first  making him the face of the party. yes  scooby and shaggy were the main characters but it was freddy that almost always started interactions with npcs
smiling friends
mystery incorporated was the closest we got to that  its extremely unfortunate that we aren t getting anything else like that but instead we get disgusting  sad drivel like  velma
@ex john vibe   mystery inc was phenomenal and I watched every episode as it aired.
and creepy.
@ex john vibe   its really funny when people try to call me racist   when I am indian too.never have I ever was the worst sort of cringe too.
trite  clumsy and mean spirited  is how the majority of  mature  cartoons end up  as if being a selfish asshole is the default state of humanity and nice respectful people are gullible idiotic nerds.I just want an animated show for an adult audience that doesnt make me feel depressed  but they re very few and far between.
exactly  its like. they dont know any of the true lore and all the issues they see are just projections of their own insecurities.
didn t original fred do that  I seem to remember numerous incarnations of the show where he would listen to and consider the the thoughts and ideas of other members of the team.
@celtichound   yes  yes he did  everyone did  they re just doing this for  woke  culture.
fred always takes credit for other people s work  tell me you never watched the og without telling me you never watched the og... only time fred took credit for other people s work was the live action movie when he was played by freddie prince jr
I know its been awhile since I have seen fred in action  but I remember him saying something along the lines   good job team!  at the end of every episode.
God even supernatural treated scooby doo with more respect in their cross over than the writers for this show did
daphene was self defense-caring individual velma a brilliant person who everyone on her team respects and helped put things together scooby and shaggy not only monster bait found clues and had comedy that worked because they bounce  off each otherfred trap guy who wasn t dumb and cared for his team and gave credit where it was due
fred s description sounds like mindy is projecting. like she got rejected by some white guy in high school and is now turning this whole show into something both meant to shame people that look like fred while also trying to play out some alternate fantasy where she should have been the center of attention in school
I hadn t really thought about it this way but it really does say something of the mentality that they race swapped or erased everyone but fred  and made the conscious decision to keep him a white guy just to emasculate and humiliate that character in particular.   these people are disgusting.
that was the coolest thing about scooby-doo the group were all different and from different places but respected each other and got a long. pretty positive message that for some reason needed to be changed. so many shows are now all about the negativity in the world and how racist and sexist everything is. what happened to fun  hope  and people over coming issues to see the brighter side of things  and how is attacking the fans a good business strategy  dont forget to blame the same people you attacked for no one watching and the show going under. in he words of will ferrell   I feel like Im taking crazy pills!
you knew that was coming just from looking at that first image of him they provided. he looks hapless and confused. a complete 180 from the actual character.
wait  are they saying they put fred on puberty blockers
happy to see you talk about this  it was one of the main things to piss me off. fred was turned shallow just because they could  he worked as daphne s camera man for the love of God. guess he must be a shallow ass
when I was a kid I named my first dog after fred because he was such a nice  cool guy. sucks that they cant see that because of his race.
this show has single handedly made me black list warner discovery  it was bad enough they did everything else  but now they ve come for the least well treated character in the entire gang. in the original freddy was nice  good hearted   and smart. he deserves more respect.
fred s wholesomeness was the biggest source of comedy in some of the more recent scooby doo shows. it was more fun to speculate  is fred gay or is he that oblivious  . traps magazine. traps magazine. lmao. subtle humor is what scooby doo does best. lol. scoody doo was so good for so long.
how the hell did hbo max go from making masterpieces like band of brothers and chernobyl to this
the creator is like artist when they someone s art and they say  there fixed this for you
critikal had a great point when talking about the writers and asked why are they so angry all the time.
I dont remember freddy taking all the credit. that was something they did for the scooby doo live-action movie. shows how familiar they are with the ip they are hijacking
wow girl you make me want to be a better person every day! love the videos! keep up the great work!
I would love to see a scooby-doo show made for adults. the subject matter of the original show lends itself well to adult content. adult content does not mean rampant sexualization. the movies  both live-action and animated  show that you can make scooby-doo for young adults and even regular adults without going this route. moreover  while I dont have a source for this so take it with a grain of salt  I think they ve actually aged down the characters for an  adult  series. iirc for all but the most recent series and a pup named scooby-doo  the mystery gang was a group of college students on a break.
the characters all had parts and interesting details about them and carried the plot. but the show was about scooby-doo and shaggys crazy stoner highjinks. but really was about the dog and his role in the whole ordeal.
exactly. its basically a class in self-insert and character assassination.
I dont blame ryan for dumping her.
@geeebuttersnap  who
@matt d  its a reference to  the office.  her character dated ryan in the show.
@john swain  oh ok  its been years since Ive watched the show.
so more of the same then
@geeebuttersnap  ryan started the fire
for real though
this is like she-hulk all over again
it is 100  some stupid revenge fanfic.
they claimed that he s the only one defined by his whiteness. now we what know what they meant by that
and gender
man  I cant wait to grow up in this reality where people are going to insult me and call me a misogynist and an incel for doing what I do and liking what I like. what fun!
@pok mon trainer jaden        Im a straight edge guy honestly alot like fred because Im older brother and take care of my siblings  however shaggy was always my favorite and I think its because he s nothing like me. fred is always fun  daphne also awesome thatshe knows like kung fu lol  always liked velma and how she essentially put the whole mystery together  scooby-doo just obviously fantastic  but shaggy was always who I considered an awesome friend. even in those weird live action movies.
he eventually stopped doing that in the movie too. the movie was also a parody  so itshouldn t have been taken seriously.
@xtremenerdpat  that was part of his character arc in that movie so it worked as good character conflict even if they are supposed to be parody spoofs.
what movie was thst
@csp  I think it was monsters unleashed.
@ben prickett  monsters unleashed was the 2nd live action movie. the first one was simply called scooby doo
@xtremenerdpat  scooby doo live action and monsters unleashed are the only scooby doo movies I like  especially thanks to what s happening now
for most iterations the gans has been hight students on a break  not college students.
much like the original fred  what scooby doo did the writers watch  fanficts    likes to take credit for everyone else s work  he s literally the trap master and leader of the group.and he never takes credit  like a soccer team  the captain raised the trophy when the team wins the league but everybody in the team get s the glory......there re episodes and even movies where shaggy saves the day  daphne being the main heroine  and velma get s her ws  everybody gets their character arcs  like  the mystery inc has been around since the 60s  no way would people still love scooy-doo if everything s about fred.and making him douchy  and have daddy issues is just dumb.
the one thing I like about scooby-doo it changes with the times. every iteration the characters change but still stay the same. every cartoon  every comic  every live action things have been changed but the key core of the character stays the same. fred always been a nice guy and a good leader and he had his flaws. there s even a scooby-doo cartoon he has daddy issues with his father and he s obsessed with traps but he s still fred. I seen many different versions of scooby-doo over the years and I never seen someone butcher characters this bad before. there s even a comic called scooby-doo apocalypse. its a version of scooby-doo in a post-apocalyptic world. that comic stays true to the core of the characters more than this does. the only difference is scooby-doo is a genetically altered dog and he has cybernetics so he cantalk and he s brave because it the apocalypse but he still acts like scooby-doo. also they have to fight for their live but they re still solving mysteries while the world is falling apart. this series got cancel not because it was bad  its because havana barbara company didn t like that it had a teen rating and scooby-doo is supposed to be for everyone. that was their reason and they re letting this pass
this mindy kaling self-insert is a fantasy re-telling of what she wished her high school experience was
fortunately  fred is wrongly imprisoned for murders he didn t commit. how is that fortunate
fred was supportive  kind  and was comfortable in his own masculinity. daphne was sweet  lovable  and comfortable in her own femininity. shaggy was always hungry  yes but he was there with his buddy scooby doo.  velma was smart and is a best friend to daphne. scooby doo was a character who is secretly smart  but did not revel in it and is loyal. wait  where is scooby doo in this
its nice that you care about the fate of some poor man. even if he is fictional. love the no cussing also  its pretty cool. I ll go watch your daphne video.
this got me to thinking  something they will always argue for is to change the designs of characters  and try to demonize anime with the argument being  you just want to sexualize the characters  and are only upset because you cant   yet here they are constantly sexualizing characters and making everything about who the characters chose to sleep with
so is fred s deep dark secret going to be that he hasn t come out yet  by the the way they put that in there around mentioning puberty  implications with daphne  and highlighting that this is the reason he wont live up to his fathers expectations  makes me think its that
I hate what they re doing to this show. what the heck. ruining fred. these people have big problems. fred and the whole team loved velma. she was an amazing put of the team. sounds like they re trying to destroy everything that was good about scooby-doo. youre right it is disgusting. sounds like the hbo max version is all over the place with their story. great video. thank you for keeping us updated. I appreciate your take and know that Im not the only who feels this way. have a good day melonie.
I would definitely watch an adult animated scooby-doo doo gang as adults because like you said its like we are growing up besides them  it reminded me of that crossover special supernatural had with scooby doo where the cartoon characters are facing real life consequences instead of cartoon logic like how shaggy broke his arm. but the fact that the creator thought its okay to change the race  personalities and sexuality of these characters just threw that out the window. Imean at this point just make them new characters cause that would make more sense and gives you an identity than pissing off people who are supposedly going to watch your show. she could make a show parodying the scooby doo gang and they can solve more mysterious such as murder to give it thatsense of real danger and they can even play around with the dynamics of the characters.
from what I remember of watching scooby doo  fred was the leader and trap specialist  velma was the second in command and the defacto brains of the team   daphne would be the one who the others would bounce their ideas of off  shaggy and scooby were the pair of layabouts who ate and then would accidentally lead the bad guys into the trap!
if I remember the old shows correctly  fred was group lead and trap guy. daphne was the pretty girl stereotype with a mcguffin bag. seriously how often did something she was carrying around in her purse have a direct impact on a case    or the gang figured out that daphnes stereotype basically guaranteed  provided shaggy didn t trip over the issue  she would be targetted as bait. velma basically ran the case for the team because even when they found something it took velma to identify it and remember it when it came up later. scooby is a great dane   a cowardly one but still a great dane and dogs frequently help with cases. shaggy  scooby is his dog  and his whatever goes  nope . attitude over the course of cases  provides randomness to the team. theoretically you could predict the other three but shaggy and his dog   meet mystery inks wild card  they might eat an entire buffet  or they might flee directly into your secret lair on accident.  and theirs the internets theory he funds mystery ink by selling pot out of the back of their van.  do you think the velma writers realize that race bending  shaggy has caused a stereotype  every existing scooby doo show and movie shaggy being a coward was just shaggy being a coward. by making him black they re checking off the stereotype of black people being scared of everything.   leaves troubling context to the continual role of  bait  shaggy and scooby play and shaggy casually eating dog treats. in every previous show they agreed with a bit of bribery and it was kind of an unspoken understanding thatshaggy was probably one of the fastest members of the group  and as much of a coward as scoob could be  he was still a great dane and would go after shaggy dog treat or not.
Imean  if there was any character even close to being useless in original carottn it would be daphne  but only because she was doing the least  and only because scooby and shagy had power of slapstic convenience on their side   not because she wasn t doing anything at all. every squad member was bringing something to the team  and although basic  every character was well defined by their character and skills  and not just one type of joke associated with each character
remember when the scooby gang were just all about solving mysteries taking a road trip across the country  pepperidge farm remembers.
fred was the leader  daphne was the brawn  velma was the brains  and shaggy and scooby were the stoner luck and food propaganda. well  and the comedy.
if fred hasn t gone through puberty yet he d be shorter than daphne  incapable of building muscle  so not an athlete at 16  his voice would be high pitched. you cant hide that at 16.fred s thing was he came up with convoluted traps for the bad guy that never worked right but still caught the bad guy due to shaggy and scooby s highjinks.
they gonna make scobby a cat next smh
at least cartoon network did the scooby-doo gang good and gave them actual character development
first off this video does great at explaining what they are doing to our boy fred. Im waiting for a shaggy breakdown . also where did you get that hoodie or pull over  I am beginning to like nordic clothing.
fred was always the brave one who pushed the gang when they wanted to give up. he was a true leader  leading from the front
the actress with barely any talent who keeps getting work is so oppressed.
oh her. that explains a lot.
yeah  actually that judy jetson fake remix sounds like it would be a lot better I think
didn t she already do that in  never have I ever
so its like that dumb comic  I am not starfire where the writer makes herself the daughter with looks and everything then says its a not self insert because she got caught
has there been a female writer other than jk rowling who didn t just write about her own experiences   feminist fantasies  not to say male writers are amazing  most of them suck  but there are at least some good ones with imagination who can write outside themselves.
come on  you dont think the 17th funniest person on the office deserves all these shows
@ashura  yes
@ashura  that whole thing was such awful cringe
@sup  why do most male writers suck
pretty much
damn that burn  though
this show is clearly being made with hate. hate for the creators of the original. hate for the fans of the original. and  most of all  hate for themselves. because no person that is actually happy and satisfied with their life would ever think any of this is okay.and Im fairly certain most of that hate comes from jealousy and envy. they cant stand the thought of people that aren t exactly like them being happy or successful  so they metaphorically tear them down by writing characters like this. characters that are defined entirely by their flaws and past trauma  with zero redeeming qualities.thats how they see themselves  and thats how they wish everyone else was too. because life is only fair when everyone is as miserable as you are.
they are inventing criticisms of the show that never existed.  nobody on the team  including scooby and shaggy who are almost useless 99  of the time  are treated like outsiders!  they were such good friends to each-other!
@doomspud  you are so right. it would have been just as easy to just make this a spoof with all different names. mindy chick seems like a real twisted ticket  hateful  spiteful  and jealous as all get out. they didn t have to hijack the scooby gang like this. you know its a dumpster fire when warner brothers wouldn t even let them use scooby for this bs.
jeez
this show  bro  its every show  literally everything being produced in the last few years has done this. I used to like the idea of reboots  but not when they just make every character gay or creepy.
@psychedelic fox  youre one of the creators of this abomination of this show huh   explains a lot
thats why in ventures brothers it portrayed fred as a drug addict.
shaggy did own the mystery machine. he and scooby were the bait in all the plans
@markmagician2    daphne owns the van. its literally in the show Bible. daphne paid for it. fred repaired it. velma equipped it. the only things shaggy and scooby did concerning the van was shaggy found it and scooby helped slap a fresh coat of paint on it. daphne bought it from that old band the mystery kids  mother and their keyboard player flash flannegan. whenever shaggy  scooby  velma or fred are driving  its only because daphne allows it. in later years the van became red because daphne bought a spare called the mysstery machine...and fred wanted their van to be red. any paperwork they sign for the van has the name daphne anne blake on it...because they literally cannot afford a no-car payment unless the blake name is on it. she s a bubble bath heiress  they mostly sponge off her money until fred  velma and shaggy get jobs. fred writes books does camera stuff for daphne s  lois lane  the tv show even though she looks more like lana lang   velma s at nasa owns her own bookshop  shaggy s a dabbler between gym teacher  professional p.i. w scooby   scrappy  lab assistant to his uncle pro-athlete pro-chef international security w scooby...and he knows how to fly.
@will n  but seems like shaggy had it the longest  but never thought that daphne bought
@markmagician2  shaggy gets to drive it the most because he s her man given 13 ghosts confirmed subtly that they were infact married by that point and all along there had been subtle hints thatshe only dated freddy initially because its what  society expected of her  and we know she has the lois lane attitude about that...even though it had been established since episode 1 that daphne had always liked shaggy better than freddy. even as kids in pup and wnsd they showed hints toward it. daphne makes comments about how cool scooby is most  the correct way to date shaggy btw...not like velma forcing herself   actually making stuff for shaggy and scooby  telling freddy when splitting up is dense  shaggy always rescues daph  occassionally the two dared to hold hands as kids  almost like it was a social no-no for daphne  a rich girl to be closer than just friends with the common policeman s kids..yes shaggy s dad is the police  and when shaggy is so startled beyond scooby comforting him like a service dog  he scooby-leaps into daphne s arms...so does scooby. finally...whenever scooby needs a break from shaggy  because that happens  he goes to daphne first...and if its been a rotten day...daphne can give those two a run for their money in chowhounding.freddy only drove it a lot earlier entries because as frank himself has said  he used to be the only one with a liscense . as soon as shaggy and daphne got theirs...they started driving more frequently...usually shaggy  but daphne finally drove her own van for three years in a row from 1983-1985. velma and scooby dont drive much because scooby tends to get confused easily and velma is pretty much a fun-killer. fred tends to be the  destructive driver ...shaggy occasionally needs an atlas and daphne is the only one with an actual sense of direction  just dont ever let scooby mistake the atlas for swiss cheese again!
this right heredaphne was the brawnif hbo is so obsessed with  must break every stereotype  then just look here!! daphne is glamorous and is the fighter of the group!!
did fred really take credit for people s work  he came up with crazy traps and it was usually up to scooby and shaggy to lure the monster in but I dont remember fred taking credit outside of the first movie but that was a plot point that caused the team to split.
the best reboots or reimaginenings still keep their qualities and do better with said qualities.  the boys  is a great example of that. or  the proud family louder and prouder  its a reboot but they re still all the same characters at heart.
that is biologically impossible with fred s size and  being the jock
I appreciate that melonie can uplift men without tearing other women down
as a kid I always assumed daphne and fred were a couple and shaggy and velma were a couple.
these studios dont seem to realize that old shows were more diverse and inclusive than anything they are attempting to release today.
they removed scooby. at that point they could have created a show instead of ripping off an existing ip. they could have created a team of poc teenage investigators with no ties to scooby and got more viewers than they ll get ruining a beloved series.
Ive shook my head so much the past 5 years at what they ve done to all my ips growing up  its quite ready to fall off.
correct me if Im wrong  but there is never an instance in the original scooby-doo  what s new scooby-doo  or mystery incorporated where fred takes credit for something he didn t do. and if there is an instance Im not thinking of  its a one off instance played for laughs.
much like the original fred  he s always taking credit for other people s work. fred in the original   set up the traps  joined in on brainstorming with the others when trying to find out who the culprit was  said  good job  gang!  literally every time they caught a monster yeah  seems like a self centered douche to me.
as a fan of pittsburgh sports teams  Im loving that you hit 66k subs  melonie. one might even say le magnifique   I know you dont really follow the penguins  but I couldn t resist.
the only time I think fred  took credit  for others work was the beginning of the live action movie.and then he grew as a character by including everyone of his team in the news.
the best incarnation of the scooby gang was mystery  inc. the team was put through hell and back in a twin peaks scenario that made their bonds stronger. fred got the worst of it learning his parents were not only part of the original team that preceded them but learning they sought after a power that could corrupt and destroy reality. it made him better  stronger and smarter than them. hell  he even had his captain kirk moment with the mystery machine! fred was and is still a bad-ass!
thing about fred is he always say team or gang.  he didn t take credit and believed in the gang!
I sincerely cant believe this. I dont think these writers have ever watched an episode of scooby doo. there s literally nothing you cantell me to make me think these people have ever watched a single episode
it is honestly shocking to me that the live action mystery incorporated youtube project has managed to better produce a mature scooby show   with the characters also still being in highschool Imight add  on their tiny budget than hbo  solely due to the fact they actually give a damn about the characters.
this is amazing lol I grew up with scooby doo and this looks like something I can still enjoy and istg they need to make shaggy and scoob big stoners lmao but the minor shit kinda creepy lol
I wonder if they ll make fred somehow the bad guy in the masks in every case
fred takes credit for  everyones work   Im pretty sure his two catch phrases in the original series were  let s split up gang  and  good job gang!  as in they all did work.  the only time fred has had that flaw was for the live action movie and it was literally a part of his arc that he got over.
1 41 finally someone puts it into perfect words. make new characters in a new series. dont screw up an already liked group of characters
no the creators of the show are straight up lying. either that or the only scooby doo thing they watched was the live action movie which was originally supposed to be a parody
he did once  and only once  in the live action movie. it was meant to be a spoof of the dynamics between mystery inc. obviously he didn t do it again.
the crazy part is mindy was told by wb they couldnt use scooby in this show because they knew the show would bomb and didnt want to lose money using the mascot character so she was like bet ill use velma and make myself as her
precisely
scooby is kinda saved from the dumpster fire this show is
mystery skulls is an example. cause the characters have nothing with ties to scooby doo  yet its a mystery incorporated show with a guy  a girl  a kitsune dog and a dead skeleton ghost guy. like its similarish but not in the same way
I agree
mystery  inc. was an underrated gem  expanding on the original premise in smart  surprising ways. each of the gang had full proper character arcs  exploring what made them tick individually and as a group  and the show skilfully blended mystery  comedy and drama for a wide audience. and  to my knowledge  it did all this without cheesing off a huge majority of the fan base. its fine for the franchise to reinvent itself in new ways  its done that already countless times. but the lack of respect for the source material  and the fans who have loved all its many versions over the years  is shocking.
thanks man  you just motivated me to go back and re-watch mystery inc.
the writers watched that movie  and thats all. its like one of the show runners for  rings of power  stating they aimed to  remain true to the spirit of the original movies . um... not the dozens of books  collected notes  hundreds of letters  etc  of course not -- everyone involved maybe watched the movies and thats the extent of their interest in the original material. they re using others  ideas to promote themselves -- and failing because they re incompetent.
in all three of his catch phrases  he specifically calls the group gang.  well gang  it looks like we have another mystery on our hands.  and the two you mentioned. even when shaggy and scooby crash through a wall on accident and find something  he immediately congratulates them and let s them take credit like they planned it.
so easy to tell when parents have done a great job raising a girl! unfortunately women like this are becoming rare and the pool of marriage material is really shallow. I know this goes for men also and high quality women now struggle to find a man that was raised right also! you give me hope!
fred is like  golden retriever personified.what the fuck happened-
the whole premise of the show was about scooby-doo and his pothead buddy accidentally bumbling into solving crimes despite their three friends being way more qualified to actually do it.
thank God the company that owns the copyrights to the scooby character wont let them use him in this adult cartoon spinoff
Im so tired of the creepy high school shows! like how hard would it be to make them college students ! !
I keep forgetting they are teens. I grew up watching zombie island and the 80s scooby which had shaggy as like a counselor  teacher. it wouldn t have been out of know where to make them adults for this series.
if I want to see a more mature scooby-doo with darker themes I ll watch mystery incorporated xd
if they wanted to do an adult series for scooby-doo they could have done animated series based on scooby-doo apocalypse comics. it was great not perfect it could have a better flow because sometimes characters didn t fell like they had progression as a character even though time passed in the comic according to the story.
be cool scooby-doo is really gonna be appreciated now lol
the super mario bros movie may still have some naysayers after winning almost everyone over  but you cantell that miyamoto had the time of his life. you feel his excitement and pride for seeing his two sons  mario and luigI  be brought to life in such a vibrant and colourful way. velma  on the other hand  I got this uncomfortably passive-aggressive and spiteful vibe from the trailer. replacing the races of established characters  but keeping fred the same and retconning him into a dim-witted douchebag  it blatantly feels like they re raising minorities up by putting white people down. the self-aware dialogue  where velma complains about changing judy jetson  doesnt feel clever. it feels smug. you just know that the show will make fun of the people who criticise it. the super mario bros movie is a love letter written by miyamoto. velma was born out of pride  vanity and anger.
is there a petition we can sign because I will in a heartbeat. its crazy how they have to take every childhood memory and ruin it for everyone. at this point just make a new show with new characters
gotta love that now scooby doo is every western show about teenagers  where its just  sex sex sex. a wholesome relationship  hand holding  what s that  let s just cut straight to the kissing and boobs!
I wonder when hollywood will realize that twitter isn t their only target audience.
dont watch anything from hollywood anymore and I gotta say  its been a pretty positive experience.
this just made me watch the old good scooby doo
nobody wants this but other perverts.  perfectly put.
just wanted to say  I appreciate that you dont swear. Im used to people swearing  happens all the time  I personally choose not to and I dont judge anyone for it  but sometimes it gets kinda lonely. I respect you and am gonna subscribe for sure.
I always thought each character had their own ability and would always use their minds together to solve the mystery and catch the bad person. they were all equally valuable to their team and friendship.  I believe that is why the series lasted for so long . that is until mindy got ahold of it . she could have easily added new characters and dropped scooby . but this is an adult show which I did not relize at first but I definitely will not be watching it cause the trailer was awful.
you know I never viewed fred as the leader  more co captain he and velma explained things to the cops. fred was just the guy with the keys.
that would require imagination.
@travis bishop  not even! simply age them up to be in a university  so we dont have the borderline cp shit for a show for adults
these people would never do anything remarkable
wow  we re really at the point where the mario bros. movie is used in a comparison as the good example.
velma was always part of the group! all of them are good friends...
I feel like this is a stretch because in mystery incorporated they had adult tones as well  fred had daddy issues and literally left the gang to go off on his own to find his parents  daphne was insecure but ended up having her moment  and velma and shaggy were basically dating
exactly!!!! why even bother purchasing a franchise if they hate on its characters to begin with. this franchise has fans spanning over 50 years. dont bother buying this franchise if all they do is twist and corrupt and make the fans hate it. these people are sick.
melonie your more natural look is incredible. keep up the great work!
as a kid I used to watch this cartoon a lot. now I still watch it and enjoy it but with my kids. but now I am scared to turn on the tv because not only woke  but perverts took over kid s shows. this makes me sad.
fred and shaggy were 17 years old  daphne was 16  and velma was 15. Im a 90 s baby  and grew up on the cartoon show thinking they were grown ass adults. here I am  30 years old being told this is targeted to  adults  trying to figure  how   . there s nothing in this show thatshould be targeted towards adults if the scooby-gang are minors. and then they strip the main character that we all know and love  scooby  because he was too cartoony. now you got me curious of where this show is suppose to go.. because if shaggy  oh  Imean norville  is going to be acting crazy and scared of everything  with this eating disorder  when did he ever find scooby  or did they seriously just erase the character  because this is a horrible representation to a so-called  prequal . could have just pushed this to the gang being 21  years old where velma is going through some serious crime as a private investigator as a starter career fresh out of college or something and was reuniting with the crew..like why waste money and time on this and say its targeted towards the  adults
there goes 1 of my favorite childhood shows...so disturbing what they ve done   .
this corruption of innocence has been in the works for a long time  before they got this obvious about it they were more into just making sure that cartoon characters were just the most awful role models ever  like with teen titans go for example. also been missing the verse of the day  is that going to make a comeback someday  keep being awesome either way!
when has fred ever taken credit for someone elses work  its always his plan and his traps that catch the bad guy.
I grew up with the original scooby-doo back in the 1970 s  and I find just the thought of an adult version that you describe to be perverted.  for me  scooby-doo has always been  and should always be a children s program.  I liked the two films  though I thought that the first was better than the second  but both films remained true to the basics of scooby-doo  in that they were for children  with only vague suggestions of relationships  and absolutely no scenes of even partial nudity.what I find a little disturbing is that they appear to have actually made the scooby-gang younger than they were in the cartoons and films  as in from what has been said  fred is going to be 16 with daphne and velma younger  but in the cartoons each of the scooby-gang drove the mystery machine at one point or another.  a quick look on the internet says that in order to have a full diving licence in the usa the minimum age varies by state between 16-18.  this means that in the cartoon the whole gang must be 16   while I always pictured them as being in their late teens or early twenties.
I was a little kid when scooby doo 1st premiered and the 1st couple of seasons have always been my favorites. the later seasons and incarnations just didn t do it for me both b c I was getting older and b c they just weren t as good we wont even mention scrappy.....which is also why I liked the 2 movies. and thats it. thats all I have to say on it b c its just another thing from my youth the  wokies  just feel the need to ruin! cant they come up with something of their own
just watch mystery incorporated cartoon  tons of growth and development. fred had daddy issues as well  but not like that. in incorporated hot dog water has a crush on velma-hence the opening  which is fine because story development. but then they chickened out of them dating. incorporated had such great story and character development!!
imma be real.... I never knew they were teenagers until now. as a kid  I thought only adults could drive and were responsible enough to own pets  so that must mean they re adults . never had a clue
what the actual heck. they might as well call it a parody at this point lmao. fred was never mean  even in the og series  he even came up with a lot of the traps if my memory serves me well. the whole  daddy issues  arc was played out in scooby-doo mystery incorporated as well has him lacking self-awareness. but considering how traumatic it would be to find out your neglectful father is actually your kidnapper  you can kinda cut him slack in that one. regardless fred was never abusive  he was always supportive of his friends.also wtf on the  he hasn t hit puberty  bit who in the writers life are they projecting onto fred. why are the reaffirming hate on white men  for someone pushing inclusiveness  the creator is isolating a portion of viewers and making what they said is  just a cartoon  highly political. how did they get permission to systematically destroy the origional story and characters like this  and removing the namesake character  this aint scooby-doo  its a fanfiction.
emasculating men is what activists in hollywood do best these days. so its no surprise its happened to fred the renowned and respected leader of mystery inc.
nothing will ever beat the original scooby doo
I dont remember any  dating  related stuff in the old scooby doo. to me it has always been about a group of friends who got into spooky situations and solve mysteries.
I would actually argue they may have age them down because when I was a kid watching scooby doo I always thought that like fred was 21 and maybe daphne was 19 and velma was maybe 18 and so was shaggy. they seemed like young adults to me when I was growing up.
I cant believe they did fred like this  the guy was just into building traps.these are also the same people that complain about fan-service in anime.
we re not gonna get our good scooby doo mysteries for a while are we
they hate it  and want to destroy it. that is all I can glean from this.
the bought it to ruin it  because they hate.
its called sadism  they get a kick out of it.
and even then he usually gives the credit to whoever did the most work while said plan was in action
Im 99  sure he says  good job everyone!  after every single monster caught lol
they re trying to say white guys do that.
@hermit craft fan  yeah he d always bring everyone in and congratulate everyone with a loud  great job gang!
its like one time in the live action movie... but even in the end  he had character development and gave velma the credit. so its still stupid
hollywood at this is giving a middle finger to people who just want good movies and shows
they equally excel at turning women into unlikeable mary sues  which I guarantee will be what this velma will be like.
I was a teen when  a pup named scooby doo  came out. it was adorable  from its 60s doo-wop intro song  to puppy scooby. I liked hanging on the couch saturday mornings  forgetting about my troubles of the time and feeling like a little kid. the people in charge of  reimagining  these characters dont realize that the creators made a kitschy  cartoon about teen sleuths. thats it! all of the sociopolitical nonsense is the projection of this reboot. I wish I could go back to the time when the most controversial direction of scooby doo was the addition of scrappy doo. excellent content
the main reason I think why more and more child cartoons more and more being introduced into the adult industry is probably more so due to more and more of the generation refuses to grow up themselves. today its more so about having the adult materials but never the adult responsibility.
back in the day as a child I used to run and turn on scooby doo now it has become a cartoon that adults sit there kids in front of the tv and say here watch this.  its a form of grooming and a form of mind control
yes  being a good leader is tough. didn t expect to be reminded of that here  but with the circumstances of life regularly having me that position  its very much appreciated.
beside the topic of the show. you where spitting straight facts about  the double standard  about how men are critised about no being able to get girls. I never even thought about it like that
the new  interpretation  of scooby doo makes me want to commit crimes against humanity
in the original cartoon  didn t fred legit come up with the plans on his own  I know in the movie velma made the plan and he took credit for it. but in the later adaptations itseemed like he was either more like the original fred or a loveable muscle head who didn t even realize how much his team valued him looked up to as a leader.
thing is there are stories and movies where the gang are adults and no longer high school students  so its not like they could not have aged them up.
the wholesomeness is rather refreshing. I can get behind it.
fred is a lovable himbo.
let s not forget that casey kasem was the voice of shaggy. those were the days.
the other part I did not like was where itsaid  fortunately fred was wrongfully convicted of murders he did not commit . they seem to be happy thatsomebody is wrongfully accused. its bad enough when it happens in real life but to bring it to a cartoon and make light of the situation. they seem to be happy it is happening to a guy
the virgin statement made me think of hocus pokus where everyone is so shocked the teenage boy is a virgin. it made the movie awkward and it was for kids!
yo spoke so much facts in this vid. first video ive watched from u and instant sub from me
thanks for speaking some serious hardcore truths!  and thanks for using the word  pervert .  we need to hear that more!
writers be like  we say velma is gay and then we make her have a crush on fred. booom suprise she is bisexual now! but fred has a deep dark secret. boom suprise he is into puppy play! this is some m. night shyamalan level shit!
this abomination of a show should not exist. they have totally changed these characters to their core. velma was never a gossipy internet troll. she s the entire brains of the operation. velma is too intelligent of a woman to be talking the way mindys version does. she wouldn t stoop to something like that.
as someone who grew up with scooby doo. this has  nope  written all over it. first off  race swapping is a huge red flag. dont get me wrong  there are cases where it works  but more often than not  race swapping never goes well. 2nd  they re not even using scooby. it isn t called the scooby doo series for nothing. you can have scooby without the gang  but you cant have the gang without scooby. and dont even get me started on the characterizations.this basically sums up everything thats wrong with modern western media. this is why I started watching anime more  cause they dont pull this kinda bs.
ok this  original fred  that  takes credit  must b from a totally different show. cuz the fred I remember hardly ever toots his own horn even when he does do something awesome. every success he either attributes to the team as a whole  or to individual team members  but hardly ever himself. if anything  that fred s main flaw was that he was too trusting and being the biggest boy scout in the show  his campiness causing him to fall for deceitseveral times  not all the time  but sometimes  while the rest of the gang were suspicious from the start. by the by  the fred Im talking about is prior to the 2015 reboot  I never watched that garbage. these ppl are just ignoring all of that and just characterizing fred as a  white guy  and just labeling him with all the stereotypes attributed to modern day  white guys . every character from back then were amazing and had their own strengths and weaknesses  pros and cons and the fact that they re just ignoring all of that  claiming the character were these warped versions of their true selves and need to be changed  just shows that they have absolutely no idea what the original scooby doo was like and are just using the brand for the name alone.
that description of fred sounds like hbo s trying to set up a wattpad fanfiction
aww I remember thatshow
that movies portayal of fred was really weird. it felt like they couldn t make a conflict without making fred a douche.
the live action movie was a parody meant to show how they group could grow apart  so characters weren t themselves. fred otherwise is friendly  trap-crazy  and is willing to listen to and give credit to his team  even if they found something by complete accident.
@matthew simon  I wish we d move away from  trap crazy  that is a more modern interpretation. I think he should keep the macguiver resourcefulness in catching the monsters but the fred is obsessed thing feels more like a parody.
@haven  true. Imean I assume it was made to more define his role other than just leader but still.I always saw fred as the one that held the group together and acted as the muscle some times  macquver at others and leader at most.whereas daphne does similar stuff but leans more to improvisation on the spot.velma is strictly the book smart one who is a master at all things academicshaggy and scooby are the comedy duo but also the ones who hold the most heart for the group
@peronkop  itseems like that is just the arc they chose for him in that movie  which resolves by the end  and thats not the end of the world. its just that it certainly doesnt seem to be a constant character trait of his  and in fact quite the opposite of most versions. so its odd that they say  like in the original...  and then describing the character that way.
@haven  fred was never  trap crazy . that was something the later cartoons did. in fact  to be fair  the relationship thing also only came in later cartoons because in the original  it literally was just a cartoon about a group of friends traveling and solving mysteries.
@edward newgate  that was what I said. I said I didnt like that thry made him trap crazy and he wasnt always that way.
@haven  my bad  misread the original comment from you. sorry.
thatsounds yikes!
oh yay the stigma of if your a teenage guy and a virgin your a loser ... still regret tossing my v card to any legs that opened cause of thatstigma wish I just waited. wasent enjoyable at alll..
yeeeah  but Ive kinda always wondered how much it was originally supposed to be for kids. there s a lot of themes there that made my parents regret taking me and my sister to it in theater. I liked it  she was younger and terrified. it kinda always felt like it maybe was meant to be pg-13  disney recut it or edited the script  and some things got looked over.
at least with the mc still stepping up to the plate and managing to end the witches  spree and return binx to his sister the movie wound up making a moral where being a virgin ultimately has no impact on your strength or personal character whether or not the writers intended that.
thank you so much
its true a man s value isn t based on sex  its based on how well he can provide for a significant other.
as a teenager that age I can say that 90  of people that age dont do that
preach it! hanna-barbera would be rolling in their grave the both of them. definitely makes me want to never having an hbo max subscription again. only had it once because my wife and son wanted to watch the new Godzilla movie months ago. one of the things that made me go no thanks to keeping hbo max  besides the price   was hearing about unpregnant... and then seeing part of the harlI quinn cartoon and part of jellystone.... I really dislike how hollywood is doing this to everything.  amazob. netflix  and disney too... I would love to see someone do the reverse. something that is considered acceptable by the woke and make it like Christian based or at least family friendly for all audiences like the target of the original hanna-barbera audience was. both to enjoy and see how the woke freak out.
haven t they seen the live action scooby-doo movie were the first conflict is about daf just being a damsel and fred taking credit for velma s plan and they fix those problems by the end of the movie
I saw on twitter someone posting the idea for fred. they plan to flat out torturing the poor guy  which made me think  huh... so thats why he was kept normal...
I havea theory the reason the producers are doing this with velma  he-man  etc is for brand recognition to try to get people more invested to watch the show  but in reality it is something unrelated wearing the skins for nostalgia sake. the theory is  they are doing this on a grand scale in hollywood  as when thry try to push agenda on new content  it flops as the stories are usually flat and berating the viewer  lecturing them on why   they are bad  . there is probably more to it but  this is just my take.
fred hasn t gone through puberty yet he has a deep voice  ok.
my childhood is on fire
fred -   was the lets go team guyvelma -   was the brainsdaphne -  was the level headed oneshag and scoob -   the goof balls
daphne was jus eye candy  lmaooo me and the boys grew up simping for velma.
fred never took credit for his teams work  he always said  good job gang  and he has had daddy issues before but he was never a douche  he was a nice guy who supported everyone especially daphne. he even used listen to other ideas and was always very brave. are they just trying to rid the mystery inc gang of everything that made them cool. no scooby doo  some random black guy who s trying to be shaggy  robbing daphne of her intelligence  confidence and skills. and they have demonized fred  which of course is only happening because he s white and male. honestly the race swapping pissed me off but now they are trying to destroy everything that took a good 50 years to develop. and why cant they make up their mind  do they want velma to be a lesbien or not lol.
the most suprising thing about this whole video  is a person in the modern world who doesnt curse!! what a breath of freah air!
thank you for being rational and reasonable on this hell of an earth
you ll say douchey but not damn  lol love it!
a voice of reason  and common sense !
still dont know how this channel got recommended.  .but its very good .  and her voice lol  too cute
the people involved in the show didn t grow up watching scooby doo  they never liked scooby doo and now that they have creative control they are going to make sure you dont either.
Im an adult that wants to watch new scooby doo cartoons that remind me of what it was like to be a child. in fact I would like to share them with my child. so if they could just make more of what I liked they would get my money. like with cobra kia. its more of karate kid but not exactly karate kid.
agree with most of your points. thanks for the video!
8 14 and thats what they always do yes  ma am!
Im black and I dont like the fact that they made shaggy black and velma indian
so fred has not gone through puberty but his voice actor has.  why is that okay when apparently its necessary to race swap velma and daphne to match the races of their voice actors   puberty affects one s voice way more than race.  also  how do you hide that you haven t started puberty yet when youre like 16   shouldn t he be smaller and weaker than the other guys and have a high pitched voice   but he s a jock  a prepubescent high school jock   okay hbo.  whatever you say.
I grew up with scooby doo because my mom grew up with it I have a lot of the seasons on dvd that I will never throw away
what s new scooby-doo  their coming after you   sorry if someone s made that joke already
they cant even say that this version is for adults because most adults that would watch this would mostly be people who grew up watching scooby doo
what fred is  sometimes kind of a himbo or something  but he is a good leader with a great heart and listening skills. also a weird hyperfixation for traps.he s a great character to mewhat she saw   blond white guy. must be a leo. sucks.
this scooby-doo will never be like that in original scooby-doo I watch.
if fred is played by glenn howerton  then fred s definitely guilty.... because of  the implication  lol
thats not the fred I know
I grew up watching several versions of scooby doo. fred was always the strong male leader type who always encouraged and congratulated the group. apparently that just isnt a thing that can exist anymore. we have to build up velma by tearing down fred. this woke writer self insert shit is just getting boring bc you already know what is going to happen without even needing to watch the show.
I think Imay go and buy the older versions on physical media before they become impossible to buy.
I just remember when one of the newer scooby series turned shaggy into ultra instinct shaggy having a bar fight with a whole biker gang  and he just bruce lee gokus them.
now thats what I call crossing the line
ah  thats why they didn t change fred. they needed someone to pick on.
Imust have missed the point when velma became popular enough for  her  own spinoff.
I was originally surprised they left fred white. now it makes sense.
I found it crazy because when I saw the characters I bet money that they only kept fred white because they needed a character to bully  seems I was correct.
I knew it  I fucking knew it! the second I saw that fred was the only one who wasn t changed  I knew they only did itso he could be an outlet for jokes!
hasn t gone through puberty yet  wtf!  have you seen fred  with his deep voice  broad shoudlers and being over 6  tall. clearly he s went through puberty. what are they trying to say with this  do they know what puberty is! !
remember...  reimagination   is the new representation. note  the freaking sarcasm. equally  hollywood and that industry wont stop until they destroy every ip and piss off all of its original fan bases.
if I recall didn t one of the plot  for the movie have them  lose  velma and then gang go all put to avenge her even leading an army
I prefer the scooby doo show lyric  we couldn t have a show without ya. scoooooby scooba be doo
the real name of this new show should be  scooby doo and the sexist  racist massacre of fred jones by radicalized woke activists.
basically the shows punching bag
if you want to watch adult-oriented scooby movies  watch scooby-doo on zombie island  or scooby-doo and the witch s ghost  which had dark themes and real monsters.  they were actually young adults in those movies.
people trying to normalize children having sex is disturbing. being a teenager  the pressure that was put on me thatsex was a thing teens did gave me a disgusting feeling. children should never feel that way. let kids be kids  and let sex come naturally. although... Im now well past my 20 s and still get a disgusting feeling when it crosses my mind. it may just be me.
fred has always been the pretty boy jerk  he always put shaggy and scooby-doo in harm s way  also when the gang is split up  he always pairing himself with daphne and had velma do all the solving
I think my girlfriend is obsessed with scooby doo.she keeps telling me we should split up and search for other people.
ur take on this is perfect! idk why they re doing this
what they did to fred is like they re making an obvious  forced and ultimately infuriating set up to an awful joke. like  they gave the cool headed engineering savant leader of the team - a high-school football jock mind you  a disease that leaves him stupidly shallow  no  I dont know how that works either   and make him try to hide the fact that he  on the cusp of graduating high school  trues to hide that he hasn t hit puberty. a funny hyena once said it best   there s a lot to unpack here. ok  so first  they made the jock dude a stereotypically shallow jerk with a disease. why not just make it an actual character trait  what s the matter  dip-weasels  was the character sheet for fred not  wattpad antagonist  levels of cringe-infucingly stupid enough with the daddy issues thrown in  was it bad enough that he was pretty much the ideal chad jock in the original  69 cartoon  Im 23 btw  that you just felt like you had to knock him down a peg or six trillion two-a  so  youre making it to where one of the recurring jokes in this  mature  comedy be an early 2000 s newgrounds grade joke about a highschool junior football jock hiding the fact that he s a late bloomer... somehow.  Imean  most football players  the ones that live after the first tackle anyway  are the ones that actually hit puberty  and hit it like a mountainside  and they were a plane. without the testosterone and developed bones and muscle  a dude is likely to get killed or permanently injured.two-b  you motherf   ers that make huge wingefests about a joke bodyshaming some dipstick proceed to mock a person self conscious about not biologically progressing as others in his class  yeesh  Imake jokes about your mothers and navymen on shore leave  and even I find that cheap and low.third  something about this tells me that jung would ve had a field day with the writing crew of this show  all the way down to shaved ice and coke. going simply by the changes  one would assume their using some progressivist veil to hide why they took a cool-headed optimist that just so happened to be a jock and changed him into the poster child for up and coming school shooters. one might also assume something about insecurities over their pessimistic worldview  depressed mental states  or bad memories from high school or college that they cant get over. one can also affirm that the apparent laziness of the shallow disease can attribute to the bad memories  as a sign if simply wanting to make past tormentors look the fool or suffer in some manner they believed to be just. or they could all just be a bunch of brain-dead hacks  who knows fourth  I ll admit that the  daddy issues  thing is actually very interesting as a concept. my favorite version of scooby doo from growing up  mystery inc  used that as a cleverly done plot element to deride character development  unravel mysteries  create drama  even piggybacked on the drama for a good laugh in the season two opener. however  I severely doubt that these writers can do that. my doubt is  in fact  so severe that its life threatening. why  refer to the first point  these guys dont know jack from shit when it comes to effort. pretty sure the most tasking thing these knobjobs will do in the development process is decide what beverage to get from the office fridge. or even struggle to get up  instead referring to get the poor put-upon unpaid intern to do it for their lazy asses.
1 45 takes all the credit....  when did that ever happened in the show  in every single version hes was all about team work. he was the team leader for sure but he also shared all the acomplishment with the others. these peoples view on the world is just so warped. also Im 99  sure that this didn t ment to be scooby doo script  but somekind of  nerdy girl boss self fufilment  thing. changing 1 character is nothing new but changing the designe of 3 and 1 of of it in a drastic way  shaggy  and not having the title character of the show  which is a first I belive  makes me certain that this thing is just wearing the brand as a skin suite.
wow  who writes the backstories for these characters  are they from this planet
kind of thought the scooby crew was the  outcasts  as a whole  all coming together for their love of mysteries and big hearts.
the james gunn scooby doo movies were awesome.
mfw fred hasn t hit puberty yet  man about to be 8 foot tall after that growth spurt and have the deepest voice of all time xd. what a joke
I wonder if these writers have been met by people thatsaid nothing and just simply slapped the taste out of their mouth and walked away.
itsounds like these people have never actually watched scooby-doo a day in their life. fred has always valued his team and even tries to help shaggy push pass his fear  itseems like they re basing their ideas on these characters from a robot chicken parody version of themselves
in the original show  it might have some basic stereotypes but it worked out. the character combinations worked together well. and then the new shows gave them more development  and it was very good. but this show seems to want to grab some stuff  and make it worse  but then throw out the rest in the dump. I cantell it wants to be the new scooby doo show  but yet it doesnt bring in old fans  or new fans. the new character combinations dont work  and we haven t even seen the show.
4 15 thats it Im treating everything from ip killer writers as a projection. I think she s using this ip to tell the story of her life. of how she was sweep away by the men she was attracted to. I can almost guarantee one of these things will happen. 1  she ll velma  do all this and fred will still have eyes for daphne. 2  she ll do all of this not get with fred  but gets validated as they become a team and poke at fred for being a late bloomer. and more
Jesus Christ  what have they done to my big bro himbo!
this is straight out of the hollywood reboot playbook. step 1 add race  gender  and orientation swaps so thats at the forefront to deflect any criticism off the bat. step 2 write dialogue that intentionally antagonizes the original audience in hopes that they hate-watch the series and help spread publicity. step 3 flood the internet with access media firing back at criticism by pulling the handy-dandy race card while letting the alphabet community do their dirty work.
I really feel like they are doing this on purpose.
the high school  prom  self-insert  unlived youth  activist themed kids cartoon
I think daphne being depicted in a provocative way was because they wanted it to become popular on r 34. that would save lots of money on advertising and marketing.
wait they were
@cj gamer  yeah  delphine was even a news reporter on a news channel.
@cj gamer  yes  fred and daphne were part of a talk show  velma owned a bookstore  and shaggy and scooby worked as security guards. they even looked older in those two movies.
like most episodes end with fred saying  great job shaggy and scooby you lured the bad guy right into our trap.
sounds like fanfic of a woke ideologue to me.
pot head
just like dreamworks she-ra.
color me surprised. Imiss the 90 swe wont ever have anything good anymore.
velma had a crush on fred back in the day.
fred is responsible and works with others.
its actual character assassination at this point.
when I read that   he did not live to his fathers expectation   or   he hasn t gone through puberty yet   I bursed out of laughter. this is so disrespectfull that.... I dont know what to say. itspeaks for itself!
these people have no idea what they are doing with the scooby-doo gang at all and its disgusting to see this. they are going to try and push this until this is the identity of the mystery inc. gang for the future. dont let the classic team the good team that got along and worked perfectly together die off! this is definitely the worst scooby-doo timeline and I hope it fails so hard. normally I wouldn t care  but this is an important part of mine and my whole families childhood they are messing with here. also the original gang was well out of high-school Im pretty sure so this is de aging them not aging them up and its sick.
so we re just blatantly ignoring the fact that original fred is the trap obsessed mastermind behind most of the zany contraptions and the one behind some of the funniest scene s in the show and writing it off as him  taking credit   so we re also forgetting the fact that original daphne is basically the voice of reason within the group  the one who is usually trying to keep everyone from loosing their minds when getting chased  and also the one who usually finds leads the crew to the crucial clues oh and itseems we re also disregarding the fact that original velma was the brains of the operation  connecting clues  dodging red-herrings  finding the  chekhov s gun   so to speak  within every episode mystery what s next  are they gonna give scooby some chocolate to give the gang a tragic trauma moment  are they gonna take away shaggy s penchant for following his stomach and stumbling into the monster myth mystery of the episode  if they re going to to commit character assassinations to push their tiresome agenda  then why not just stop knocking everything else down  and just start with a clean and empty slate  and make something original  because all the new bs they shit out nowadays just scream lazy validation relevancy checks instead of real inclusiveness. hell they coulda just introduced a new character to the crew and built of from there but noooooo  cant even do something with even the slightest remote feeling of effort behind it. also side-note  ayo woke trash heaps of twitter  ain t y all just so suspiciously quiet  ain t the whole crew bellow 20  and y all s ain t made a peep nor grumble about the perversion of the people behind this new show. you s all busy keeping up your double standards aye  why dont y all drop this new dumpster fire and self-insert yourselves into one of junjI ito s works aye  cuz lets face it this is what the new scooby- oh sorry Imeant velma spin-off is isn t it  some self insert fanfic that trashes on what you dont like and promoting woke  values  to get internet brownie points right  cuz y all s high off of the weed brownies y all s baking behind the scenes right
reads title replies in monotone   oh. how surprising.  look at me. I am shocked. seriously though  saw that coming.
all this stuff would never be happening if william hanna and joseph barbera were still alive.  its only once the original creators of something are dead and gone that people decide that they want to ruin their creations because they re no longer around to stop them.
I noticed this in her other video. now they re from  poor-town . in the original they were from  cools-ville
what are they mean fred was the nicest of the group he literally congratulated everybody even though if some people didn t contribute that much he congratulated everybody and treated everybody nice and kindly Imean shit he even got roasted for being so nice that he never realize he got hit on multiple times by women and he wouldn t even notice it he literally isn t a douche Imean shit I remember one show where daphne was getting mad at him for not showing more affection because he cared so much about the team and that about making his traps its ridiculous somebody is trying to be woke while actively being one of the  most racist Ive ever seen and I cantell you thats really impressive since I live in south texas
the original fred never took credit for anyones work  velma always got the credit for the detective work and talked to the police at the end. fred just built the traps which never worked as inteded but still managed to catch the bad guy.
as he gets older  his dark secret gets harder and harder to hide. what is he  a werewolf!  ... please dont let me be right...!
this show gives me santa inc vibes.
the only thing I see right about the show is fred is coming out the closet if you watched the original you d know he was fruity
fred sounds like he is on puberty blockers
they screwed over fred and they screwed over shaggy. scooby-doo got off light.
there are plenty of adult topics that aren t sex  violence  and gore. like loss  existentialism  or politics. you can also go over typically children topics within an adult context like relationships  health  and the world.
velma was geek  shaggy was a hippy nerd  fred was a typical american guy and daphne was a cute red head gf of fred. what happened to the original characters
getting major she-hulk vibes from this show.
thats exactly what it is  first jellystone yabba dubba dinosoaurs  scoob! and now this  its sad how the bafoons running the company basically think the characters they created are public domain and let these people get away with stuff like this  hanna barbera would never let them do anything modern with them like this and be furious if they saw what these idiots are doing to thier characters while the actual people running it now dont even care  while they continue with these insulting reboots like those Imentioned where the characters aren t themselves anymore.
my head canon is scooby saw this and made a run for it.or perhaps even shaggy sent him away so he could live another day.
@rush alias   rho are you  what have you done with raggy  sup  Im norville   rorville !  ruck this rit Im out
@rush alias  maybe scrappy doo and said   nope  ain t happenin .
@galadrius the mighty  here lies scooby doo...who s back broke because even he was unable to support this dumpster fire being made out of his 50 year old legacy
making a show about teenagers going through puberty isn t about being pervert or perving on teens... its about the fact that we all been there once in our lives. great example of it is the show big mouth.
wtf did they do to my boy fred
in all other versions of scooby doo fred never took credit for the work of others and would congratulate the rest of the gang if they did good and would give them the credit if it was mainly them who solved the mystery and he would also usually boast about his traps if they worked also the relationship that daphne and fred had in the other series was cute with daphne being obsessed and obvious about her feeling for fred and with fred being oblivious to the obvious signals that daphne was showing but apparently in this show they hate that cute relationship a bunch of fans love and want to go out of their way to make it unbearable as possible.
actually its a recent animated scooby doo movie called trick or treat scooby doo. they had velma come out by falling in love with main villain being female.
imagine looking too deep into a cartoon about a bunch of teenagers catching people in monster costumes that terrorize the peace. they have to find something problematic with everything.
when I read the plot that they ruined my fraphne I was shocked  no rendition before dared to do it  even be school had to show it very subtly because fans were mad.
fred was actually bullied in the original for being a dork among the jocks. he was never the majorly popular guy and actually had a hard time taking to girls  usually fumbling over his words when a girl would approach him. once again these writers show no knowledge of the original source material. the entire scooby gang was made up of outcasts in their own right who found common ground in solving mysteries. all of them had their place in the group and that is what made the franchise great.
its been leaked that hbo gutted the animation department for this shitshow and fired over 100 people I hope better people get to work on this and give us a  scooby doo show that really lives up to the old ones
that description of fred sounds more like shaggy   scooby
at first when you were reading about fred I thought that you were literally reading fan fiction. Jesus
scooby-doo was one of the most wholesome shows ever.fred doesnt deserve this treatment. he was a great character  a charming  respectful young man. he treated his entire gang with dignity and led them to successfully solve mystery  after mystery.its funny  scooby doo should be what these activists want. already packaged to their liking. strong  empowered female characters  with men who treated them equally and with respect.this is just proof that they dont want equality  that want to destroy white men. their true colors are flying high on this one.
even cartoon shows nowadays are getting to weird for my lil sister to watch them
so mindy kaling hates chads. maybe some of her real-life experiences coming out here. if fred hasn t gone through puberty yet  why does he have huge muscles and a deep voice
I agree dont change a amazing show
quickly realizes her thoughts and emotions have value  now thats funny.
of many incarnations of the scooby-doo franchise  itseems that its mostly velma that has no identity.
remember when storytelling and character design was on the focus of a serie and not skincolor and with whom the character wants to sleep with
I watched every iteration of the scooby gang every single 1 did they even watch 1 episodeedit even tht 1 episode in supernatural where they appeared
glad u came up in my recommendations. thank u for going thru she-hulk so I dont have to.
they didn t even actually establish fred   daphne as a couple in the old cartoons.
fred was a sweet guy man. wtf they are doing idk.
what really has me confused is that mindy kaling   charlie grandy walked into a pitch meeting with hbo  pitched all this crap and hbo said  yeah this great  let s do it!  seriously! !
since when did fred take credit for things he didn t do this means war.
they should have watched the jelloapocalypse video on fredalso bobbydakid did a video on velma regarding his perspective on race versus culture being shown
the only times they actually talked on dating was in the later movies. like we all knew what was happening and it didn t need to be said. a large problem I see with retellings and new projects they miss that their audience has brains and just throw it all at the wall. I had seen what they did with daph. bud did not know they had her as a minor and thats disgusting. I genuinely dont get how they get away with doing this shit and saying its a children s show. .     drink your water  tell the ones you care about that you love them. cya around space cowboys.
sigh . .we are never gonna get a lot of good re-vamps series movies until this  . .  whatever this stage is in the mindset of the social media   I feel a sort of balance should return   its too chaotic . but  good thoughts mells. a lot of us feel the same way. you are not alone their buddy .
did these guys not see mystery inc. and how good of a modern update thatshow was
it also seems that they dont understand men or simple human biology and human reproduction. fred seriously cant hide this. he d be shorter  he s usually the tallest of the group  his voice would be squeaky like a child s and even the issue with daphne is beyond realistic to male growth. its like saying he s stuck at 12 while being 16.
just hurting my poor himbo! how dare they hurt my boI fred jones!
they always attack our size and virility because they know itstings. like when gal gadot did it in the boat scene in wonder woman.
so fred is like jordan cross now
good thing I have a huge collection of all the original scooby stuff this new crap can  like  hit the road
I thought this show was about velma was going to college.
back when seth macfarlane wanted to make an adult version of the flintstones  ..
melonie I want you to look up the cartoon scooby doo mystery incorporated  which seams to have a darker tone to it and is enjoyed quite a bit by adults such as myself  Im 30 and I enjoy the heck outof mystery incorporated.
the  fred has dad issues  isn t really all that new to the franchise  being used in mystery incorporated and be cool  scooby doo.
imma just stick to the classic scooby doo
maybe fred should throw another tapioca party so he can fit in
I thought they all were grown asf well I was young tho so when I heard there voice ofc it was adults voicing them
wtf. I am an indian. I do not want any race swapping or any kind of freak show man. I have an image of the gang and I want my gang to look like that. they are runinig my childhood. just make another show with your characters.
I feel like they never even watched any scooby-doo  takes credit for everyone else s work  fred was the trap guy    everyone else helped out with that luring the bad guys and they all piece it together at the end
dont be suprised most company s hbo included are woke its part of why I no longer bother with movies or tv and just watch youtube
I am a lost too but there has to be some type of talent shortage or lack of talent or something! you mean to tell me that all show writers are from the wokest part of la   and nowhere else  show after show after show its the same woke crap. idk
thatshit had to one of the best cartoons when I was a kid
someone in the comments suggested that this info is pointing to the revelation that fred s actually a f-m transgender. with all the shit thats being pulled with this show I wouldn t doubt it.
hear
the flintstones was originally made for adults.
and fred I remember was a sweet guy. wtf they are on about.
@rohit kumar  a tall blond guy must have rejected mindy kaling and this is how she gets her revenge.this whole thing makes her look like a terrible person.
if fred hasn t hit puberty yet and is 16 they maybe implying he is taking hormone blockers. so yes  worse.
scrappy-doo s looking pretty good now  huh
fred is a white guy who takes credit for everyone s work fred  literally after every capture   good work  gang also didn t they redeem that aspect in the james gunn version allowing velma to get the spotlight  and it was actually tasteful and not shoved down our throats like today s movies
I agree with you 100
the one thing they did is making fred love his car more than anything and the gag is every time he remembers its destruction. they brought some of the old school villain characters who tried kill the gang and were sitting on natural gas.
they said fred was the only one defined by his  whiteness.
give me 1 example of fred taking credit for others work before the live action movie.
the fact they deaged the scooby doo gang and show daphne naked. they deaged fred by one year so I am assuming the rest of the gang are also deaged .
the scooby gang drives around in a van solving mysteries  while shaggy and scooby eat scooby snacks. thats really all the back story and character development you need. this is some ridiculous fan fiction right here. definitely giving this a pass.
agree 100  hollywood is doomed
subscribed after watching your scooby doo videos. really appreciate your input on something I watched religiously as a kid.
its like they watched the noughties scooby doo movies  saw the  girl from cruel intentions  was in it  and hated scooby forever
you all know what his secret is going to be in this new scooby-doo!
velma was the architect of the scooby squad this is a messed up plot.
we re about to get a second high guardian spice.
is scooby even gonna be in the show
they might as well just make a whole new tv show but they know it would fail if it didn t have the scooby doo names tied to it
the part where velma said  its velming time  and velmad all over the bad guys always sends chills down my spine.
but they cant be perverted........ they re  fixing  scooby-doo...... yet another reboot that makes me rewatch the original series.
I hate where they re removing scooby in the newest show  Imean they can still make it adult  and have a talking dog
@kyo mebi
@ashura  ...
racist-doo where are you sounds like the show they were looking for xd
ignoring the various creepy aspects  a  gym rat  who hasn t hit puberty  ie no testosterone and who towers over most of the squad  also a low testosterone leader  not that likely.if I had to bet  I d say they were planning to transition him in the series 2 that there is no way they ll be making.
the best adult version of scooby-doo is mike tyson mysteries  that would be the closest anyone can get to. despite not everyone being a fan of him  the cartoon itself was funny  and can be stupid  but in a good way. it has great elements for adults and it didn t really change anything of the scooby-doo franchise!
so  how exactly does fred have a girlfriend if he hasn t reached puberty  by definition  puberty releases a hormonal rush to the body  which in turn causes males to notice females in a new and different way. how can he have an attraction to daphne without that hormonal dosage  Imean  yes  children will  pretend  to have boy girlfirends because they wanted to act older than their age. it is a shame that thatsame mindset applies to these writers.
Ive always considered myself pretty far from a prude  and I find all this kind of stuff weird and pervy.
so they got rid of shaggy  changed velma s race  sexualize daphne  16   and ruin fred  ten bucks says that they made velma dumb to add  character development   and turned scooby into a pug
good work keep it up. Im tired of this  its weird and pervert. Im black and I feel bad for fred as a man. they ve had black celebrities on the show. thanks for speaking up. give the kids back they re shows we ve had our time. let kids be kids.
let s just say  the moment they woke ify ren and stimpy  they ve gone full circle...
they should turn scooby-doo into a pitbull lmao!!
they cant do that to fred  he has not yet begun to peak  he s a five star man  a God  the golden God! he is untethered and his rage knows no bounds!
damn this is the most disfunctional version of the gang ive ever seen in scooby doo  what I expect for when they describe the new shaggy is he is terrified of dogs because of course he is.
I grew up loving scooby doo and now I share that love with my little girl who loves the cartoon. them destroying this show that is a precious bonding me and my daughter share enrages me  God I hate hollywood so much  I will never resubscribe to hbo unless this garbage is cancelled now.
love your channel!!!
when did fred  take credit for everyone else s work  in the original   fted and velma were the ones who always set up the traps at the end to catch the criminals. scooby would usually mess it up but  it worked out anyway.  these creators have sick  twisted fantasies in their heads and its from a poor upbringing.
yknow how that comic book  Im not starfire    or whatever it was called  was a direct self insert projection from the main lady working on it  I wonder if this is a similar situation
I figured something like this would happen once I heard dennis from its always sunny and philadelphia was doing the voice of fred.
you have over thousands of episodes from scooby-doo series back in the past since the  50s
original fred come up with a plan or trap for the bad guy  have it ruined usually by the others  somehow still catch the bad guy  still say  good work  gang!  at the end.
how did mindy kaling go from writing the office to this  polar opposites.
this new show sounds like it was originally non-scooby doo  but wasn t getting traction so instead the creator decided to make itscooby doo so it could get green lit.honestly this entire show is just horrible and contradicting to scooby doo. velma was always loved and welcome in the group. she was the brains and everyone valued her intelligence and kindness. fred was always kind and a good leader who listened to everyone  he never took all the credit and only did that in the live action briefly . hell fred always encouraged everyone even when they made mistakes. shaggy would slip and accidentally open a door then fred would be like  wow shaggy u found the door! youre an absolute genius! . daphne was a little air heady I guess  but she deeply cares for her friends was always kind to them. she was the heart of the group. if I remember right she was also the street smart girl who knew how to maneuver around the social world and always knew how to use what she had at her disposal to help. I dont remember her ever being mean or shallow to anyone  just a little crazy with buying makeup and clothes at times lol. even then  she ditched her cozy rich life to adventure around with her friends in a van. this new scooby show sounds like the author projecting her own original plot and her own narratives onto a beloved series just so it can air. hell scooby isn t even in the show!
do franchise guidelines just not exist anymore
because the show writers dont understand or want to understand men.
thats when we riot
he s a 5 star man
thats a great tv show
thats the other scooby doo that is not being made by hbo. velma is straight in that one.
the golden God!
@josh cramer  true but everything else I watch him in he s the exact same character. so imagine that on fred from scooby doo
a body with the brain removed falling out of the locker...I like this writer self insert  so accurate
they seem to forget that daph knew martial arts and was an aspiring reporter. she was a strong female character. fred while a jock was still plenty smart  confident and charismatic . its why he was the group leader and a pretty solid one. not a impressed with how they made velma toxic just to jab at  trolls  ruins her character completely. also giving everyone daddy issues seems like projecting  then we have making the stoner character black.  we cant call him shaggy. quick use his real name. now we add the daddy issues.
dear God in heaven  that is disgusting!if you want to watch a good modern take on scooby and the gang  check out the live action fan series  mystery incorporated.  they ve only got the first episode out so far  but its magnificent  is clearly written by big fans of the franchise  and treats all the major characters  including fred  with respect.seriously  check it out.
take credit for others work  he wrapped up practically every episode with  good work gang! the only interation of scooby doo where he had a tendency to take full credit for things was a pup named scooby doo where he often tried act like he solved the mystery by claiming the offender was red herring and always being wrong  even the one time it actually was him.
if an adult had any interest in watching an adult version of scooby-doo  its probably because they enjoyed the one from their childhoods or mystery inc because that is one anyone can enjoy . this show was not made for anyone who grew up with those.
when is velma even coming out  I got max just to see this trainwreck. I thought it was supposed to come out today but haven t seen it
Im not sure why they have to overthink everything and have some sort of message and meaning behind it. scooby doo is literally about a group of friends with a dog who solve crimes and fight monsters. its thatsimple!!!!
so  let me get this straight...they re doing a parody of this simple but fun formulaic cartoon  that has been done already a dozen times and now  spruce up  the comedy with angsty drama oh boy  what a blast! Im sure it ll have more chuckling more than the johnny bravo parody of scooby do or the loving yet brutal jabs of drawn together.
I think that they should have made their own character instead of changing the characters that we love
nowadays anything wholesome and good they re going to try to ruin or are they playing out ruin and the sad part is then after they do it they say its better and its not you dont mess with classics they re a classic for a reason
I have not seen a single person defend this series so farwe havent gone insane yet thank God
God help us if hbo gets its hands on the transformers
just watch the crossover episode of supernatural to see an adult themed scooby-doo that works
when flanderizing fred into a complete egoistic idiot in both  a pup named scooby-doo  and  be cool  scooby-doo  and into a narcissistic jock in the 2002 live-action film are no longer the worst ways of butchering fred s character anymore.
scrappy doesnt seem to be the worst anymore huh
hell  they make them older. since they aren t having scooby-doo. say that he died of old age
yes  they were all friends  they were  different  the team never seemed to be like  so.... well... someone s dog is speaking... what  s scooby-snacks active ingredient cheers
loving the bb hoodie!
I just found your channel today from the other velma video and watching your videos and finding out you are a geek  Christian and gamer. Im in love with your content you ve earned another good fan today  .
good points. enjoyed the video. absolutely adore your hair.
remember kids! when the serious drama starts in a comedy show  it dies. it happened to scrubs and it happened way back with a teen comedy of my youth  parker lewis cant loose.
the early 2000 s series  scooby-doo! mystery incorporated was another good one that was great for teens and young adults. none of the characters were humiliated  their core traits and personalities stayed the same  they were given depth  allowed to grow  and their problems were real  not cheap sex jokes.
I liked scooby doo growing up.  little too old for it but its something that could have been timeless something a new generation of kids could enjoy.   they are sexing it up while still keeping it looking like a kids cartoon.  they might have got away with it if they did a whole vibe change and made it a darker more adult story.   it just comes across as creepy in its current state.   doubt I would have watched any version of it.
I always thought the kids were college age.
fred was always a good leader  now correct me if Im wrong  bit he didn t ever take credit for any of the teams work. he also always values his team  and as a leader  acts as a motivator at times to them.also I just feel incredibly uncomfortable about the whole fred storyline they re going to use in this quite literal shitshow  its just beyond weird.
they really want this to fail dont they
I agree with nowadays it feels like so called  adult shows films  are just full of swearing  drunken behaviour  graphic violence and sex stuff like a clueless teenager trying to act grown-up. I liked the  mystery incorporated  scooby-doo that was the best scooby-doo if you ask me it had the vibe of the original on the surface but had an intelligent story underneath.the batman animated series did the same thing it was geared towards kids but its intelligent story made it enjoyable for adults too part of why I loved the show as a kid was it didn t treat me  a dumb kid  like spongebob does with its nonsense and  potty humour . look at kevin conroy s batman and mark hamill s joker they nailed the characters so well they fit the adult arkham games perfectly by making them darker dispite the fact in the show they were kid friendly. and many of the best cartoon that are still loved today did the same you dont need treat kid s as dumb give them credit for their intelligents but keep the darker elements out of the show and all they need to do with the  velma  show was add the darker tone of the mysteries like the deaths and keep the original character true to the originals just add some extra layers to flash them out a but more kinda like how scooby-doo mystery incorporated did.
I think the writers know that their terrible writing wont get eyes unless they pull stunts like this.
the moment we saw what the characters looked like  we knew fred was gonna be approached with the  straight white men are idiots  style of writing
teenagers do that    well yeah and they also do substances and violence and its not okay
to quickly sum up what made the original scooby doo cast work wasfred logical not the smartest but has good instincts and good leadership qualities and is like a keystone to the teamdaphine other than suppose to be the pretty face is the  people person  of the group and handles all the people planing and stuff of thatsortsvelma pretty obvious but is the intellect and what would be considered the  true dective  but isn t good as a leader or people personshaggy and scooby the comiceted relief but more than that they were the wild cards luck factor the made the show unique and funthis is what I feel velma is going to change in the name of being woke
the one that came out when I was a kid was the best Imight watch it later. maybe thats the point of these shows  to sell older movies
it feels like they making the show horrible on purpose
love your new look. very natural. also poor fred ...and velma ...and daphne ...and where the f is scoob...honestly  what a joke of a project
y all remember the 50 s  when you could have movies and shows that were targeted towards adults without it being inappropriate for children  maybe we need to bring back the hayes code or somethin like it
loving the breaking benjamin hoodie!
Im suprised you haven t covered shiggy lmao
ngl this made me laugh so hard. at this point this show is a poorly written watt pad fanfic thatso happens to be animated xd
the literal opening line to this is just immediately dissing on everyone that would have cared about scooby-doo.  moisrcr1tikal
I actually had to pause at 3 23 and make sure I wasn t just seeing things. as a person who grew up watching the original scooby doo cartoons  Im beyond disappointed thatsomething like this is being added to the scooby doo world. I can admit that change can be a force for good  but the changes they re making for this show is a textbook example of change for the worse.
production studios are now just focused on catering to an audience that doesnt even care about the franchise while the actual fans going against them are painted as villains!
only creepy joe wants this velma by hbo.
I knew there had to be a malicious reason they left fred white. and here it is.
scooby doo squad  excuse you  its the gang  trademarked by fred jones
dang you right every insult revolves around relationships and sex.  this is why you single
I like the subtraction of the wings from your eyes. breaking benjamin s second album is the best one.
mystery incorporated was 10 times better at being an adult version of scooby-doo  despite not even being an adult showdark scooby-doo csn work.adult scooby-doo can workbut this ain t it chief
people be like  I can fix them
this show is going to be doa just on the basis of excising scooby doo from his own property.
im glad this spin off will be in its own failed universe.
cant wait for them to them say  well no one wants adult oriented scooby shows .also right about how they treated each other. I literally dont think any of the shows would ever have the crew go into a dance and if velma walked away alone they would all stop and be like wait what s wrong.
my gripe is the    fortunately  fred is wrongly accused of murder and imprisoned   why is it a good thing to jail innocent people
the self insert thing was bad enough. the deliberate near castration of fred  side by side with  presenting daphne as a sex symbol  is just hate filled and sick.   I had such a thing for mindy kaling. she s now been so annoying I cant even take her as eye candy.
why are they turning scooby doo into a john waters movie
mindy actually does a good voice performance   I just wish everything else being brought to the table didn t take a fat shit on the franchise
there are multiple scooby doos at the same time with different reality
awesome work as always melonie God bless
this has turned into such a joke at this point that itseriously could be one of those satirical references on a venture brothers episode. any of you that are familiar with thatshow and its humor should know what Imean. holy shit.
when harvey birdman and the venture brothers did better takes on  mature  versions of the scooby gang  almost 2 decades ago  something went very wrong now.
omg hate what they did with daphne her resourcefulness made every show and movie what it was
I wonder if they will introduce scooby as an otherkin furry who thinks he is a dog
soooo who wants to watch the original scooby doo series  I ll get the popcorn
its a cartoon about solving mysteries.  they dont have time for worrying about who has a crush on who when they have some guy in a monster mask or something trying to bump them out of the way of their schemes.
excuse me   fortunately  fred is wrongly imprisoned for murders he didn t commit.  wtf   that is not a typo either
how does fred drive the mystery machine if he is only 16  barney fife would have arrested him straight away when they crossed paths.
why is daphne naked in thatscene  like is it part of her character thatshe just stands around her friends with no cloths on they could of easily drawn in a towel  or something  wtf
the reason they removed scooby is because this show is supposed to appeal to adults. so there will probably be adult contents. a show about 15 and 16 year olds for adults..
fred always wearing a ascot already did that.
such a breath of fresh air to see and hear a young lady that isn t woke and full of hate and nastiness.
from what Ive seen so far it looks like they turned fred from a wholesome trap loving team leader into a douchebag
when I was a kid watching scooby-doo I didn t think about who was attracted to who. even things like snow white or cinderella.  the idea of a prince or a princess didn t appropriate the sexual side of it.  whats going on now is horrendous
thats why the old school scooby-doo show is better
listen-the moment I heard that hes starting to feel new things and hasn t really hit puberty is making me think either he ll be gay or they re just gonna have fred and velma get together
daphne looks like someone from total drama island...
wow. I dont understand what the problem is with this. I am making sure my child does not see this perverted narrative. tx mel for educating us on this cringe. yes  not naive to think sheltering my child from this is the way to go. have to have the courage to lead by example. true values are more important than what others say or do.
Im surprised they haven t rule 34 ed shaggy and scooby yet for dog-attracted-persons.
they just hate us all. they never knew love  and thats why their hate seems pure evil  insane and destructive.they hate us all. and thats why they will never  ever  understand the true characters.
if I have kids there not being show any cartoons made after the 90s
I saw this coming with fred being absolutely crapped on. I did not realize how deep the rot is in this project with daphne. this deserves to fail.
they done twinked my boi
I cant disagree...first there is no way at 16 fred hasn t gone through puberty unless there is something majorly wrong that is probably life threatening.  second is your point about a virtual nude scene for daphane  who is a minor in the show shouldn t happen.  I dont care if its for adults  this is what 12 year old fan fic writers do.
you already know that the dudes especially fred are going to be belittled in the show just because they re dudes  and the whole fiminazI narrative will be shoved into every corner of this show
in the us you can get yout driver s license at 16
stick with the classics.
the show runners already said they wanted to do a crossover with harley quinn. they ve even made a  relationship  that rips off harley and ivys relationship.
just feels like they re trying to upset people.
I know that hollywood disney and such hasn t had the best history  especially disney  when it comes to children this is going to an all-time low I was raised to scooby-doo and him being emasculated makes me just despise the creators know
look how they massacred my boy
I bet her catchphrase isn t   jinkies   anymore .
imagine making a scooby doo adaptation and inserting yourself into the main role. the amount of narcissism is quite impressive. though lets be real thats hollyweird these days.
I seriously dont understand the point of this. because so far none of itseems to come out of a place of love for the ip. they ve insulted fans in the trailer  and have been insulting the characters and even outright removing the huge part of the identity scooby. its like mindy just wanted to tell her own thing but they weren t buying itso she just replaced all the names with fred and gang and repitched it.
right out of disney s playbook.
instead of masking freddy as one of thier ptsd s- if they have to change him then show him as what they want men to be but nope  they want validation instead clearly.
fred is on puberty blockers
so fred is now fredrica
there were several jokes about shaggy possibly being a stoner  so Im surprised that no one s calling it racist when they made shaggy black
did you grow up watching the show at 4am fred did take credit often  but not in how they over dramatize it. he spoke for the group  because he was the spokesman.there was also several occasions where they did take advantage of velma... Im not sure people watched this show as much as they think they did.the rest of this  the hell are they thinking. why are kids naked    how is saying the naked kid is aged for adults a defense I think you calling this a fanfic is the best description of this. let the perverts have it.
scooby-doo mystery incorporated was good they didn t get to dark and to sexual what the hell happened to scooby-doo  velma show
the gain had so many characteristics  that made us love him and now they a destroying the franchise
its fine. calm down. hbo max cant hurt you.
I thought when they said  adult  that the gang would all be in their early 20s. so they have a under age daphne running around naked  I am scared to ask who this show is actually for.
betty hutton would tease men while also honoring their great aspects. it was cute and fun.
there is so much complete contempt for men in high status places. writer s rooms  tech academia etc.
excuse me fred takes credit for other s work wtf he is the one who makes all those booby traps and genius devices to capture monsters..he s a freaking teenage engineer bruh.....I loved fred why did they had to ruin that.
thats the plot twist in the 8th episode. the reason he hasnt gone through puberty is because he is taking hormone blockers so he can come out as female.....wholly shit it all makes sense now!
thats what I thought too
thats rather awkward! if they were college students  that would be another story but daphne is like 15 or so in this  adult  show. it doesnt make sense to have her like this.
daphne doesnt look 15 she clearly looks like a older woman. its a cartoon its not real.I could understand if she looked younger but she literally looks like she s in her 30s. I think thats always been part of the joke of many shows that there teens but looks older  shoot look at robot chicken and the skits they did with cartoons.
@k nitro  I remembered watching robot chicken at such a young age. I know itsounds odd having not been in the double digits when I watched it for the first time. as for the ages of characters in cartoons  it can be rather weird. while I dont really watch anime  it is notorious when it comes to aging of characters. some of the characters are teenagers yet look so grown like in their 30s. there are also ones that can be mistaken for small children or middle schoolers despite being in their late 20s-early 30s.
lmao fred being fred is the reason why people liked shaggy more. daphne being the overtly peppy girl is why people liked velma more. lol
makescoobydoogreatagain
when did fred ever take the credit
who thinks to themselves  we have to teach the world our message of identity politics. I know! we ll use a kid s cartoon about a talking dog with a speech impediment and his chronically stoned friend who do and say stupid shit and run from monsters! Im sure our deep thinking politics will be taken seriously in this setting.  I know all four of my nieces will turn the channel if shaggy and scooby ain t running from a ghost in the first ten minutes.
if you ever think your life is meaningless and worthless just know that there were people that worked hard on a scooby doo remake cartoon that nobody will watch.
wasn t it always velma solved everything  what mean she saying underappreciated. now fred. thank gawd scoob  found new source  for his scooby snacks. my 8 year old daughter even says this stupid and garbage. better not get this dad. oh I wont lol
is that really written by the show runners! itsounds like an insane troll that hates fred.
yeah! age them up like how they did in the live action movies! they re just showing their true colors...
if fred hasn t gone through puberty  he would sound like a little boy.
pissed I grew up with this show
this is 2016 ppg all over again
justiceforfred
this is why I watch anime.I used to watch western to asian shows on a 3 1 ratio.. now its a .1 3.9 ratio. only show Ive watch and enjoyed in the last 5 years was game of thrones and it dived a bit near the end.. and the last movie I enjoyed was avatar  blue people one.  no joke... kinda sad.
I just cant anymore  star wars the mcu dc and now scooby-doo everything is ruined everything I look forward to just makes me look back
how the hell did this show sneak through when scoob 2 and young justice were cancelled
loves to take credit for everyone else s work.  said the vandal  as they took possession and destroyed the work of others. man  when you ve gotten the big shot at stardom........ and then you failed  it must make you insanely bitter.
scoobynatural  is  and will always be  the best  adult scooby-doo  media ever made. hbo should stop trying to top it.   for anyone who doesnt know  thats a crossover episode of  supernatural  from season 13.
seems like they ve only seen the first two live action movies
the race of the characters dont matter  guys! except fred  he has to be white.  character backstory comes out everybody is cool  except fred  he s a piece of shit  and he s  not even a real man .wonder why he had to be white  while nobody else was allowed to be.
this show is evidence interdeminsional cable exists and we are now getting feed
screw this. Im just going to watch mystery incorporated again.
I have had growth problems  and I find the fact that they are doing the same to fred to riduculize him stupid and pathetic. I ll tell you  there is nothing funny about having to inject yourself with hormones just to grow up.but whatever  it doesnt matter what they do  they have already hit rock bottom when they removed scooby doo from scooby doo.
ayyyy! love the breaking benjamin shirt melonie! favorite 5 songs
its not that he s white  he s a jock.. Ive known plenty of black dudes back in school who acted just like fred lmfao
a huge problem with media today is older people writing shows about younger people and bringing their highschool stereotypes to the writer s table. I graduated in 2018 and the smart kids weren t outcasts. stem was normal and there wasn t this 1950s style bullying and ostracizing of kids who were into it.but we ll see these tropes continue until gen z gets into senior writing positions. even though our culture shifted years ago away from shoving kids in lockers for liking super heroes  to the point where younger generations cant relate.
and making daphine a pervert she s supposed to be prim and confident.
they are going to reveal fred is actually a girl on puberty blockers which is why fred hasn t gone through puberty.
Im just going to say what we re all thinking. this franchise peeked at  mystery incorporated .
well aI wasn t aware that the gang were all highschoolers... guess you learn something new every day.as a kid I figured they were all in their 20s....
fred is 16 and hasn t gone through puberty he needs to see a doctor immediately. this is not normal and normalizing this is sick
are we really shocked that the same network that produces euphoria is placing such a perverted lens on characters who are minors .....
I liked that they had velma and shaggy dating. guess thats not cool anymore.
this isn t scooby doo. this is a completely unrelated show where the main characters are cosplaying scooby characters for no reason.
nothing will be as good as the original scooby doo crew and show
what is the scariest part scooby has not been revealed yet is he now a different breed of dog  a completely different animal  dead this will be a huge dumpster fire.
wtf is this  fred never looked down on velma.
as an adult  except for romantic movie  I prefer the dating and romance just a seasoning for the drama  make the character more human. rather than shoving it to our face. it is more exciting to find the clue of the characters romantic relationship.fans wants some mystery from this series. not some hypocrite stereotypes and agendas.
why do they ruin the character  just why    fred is like big brother to everyone  never took credit like selfish person would.
actually  they aged them down. the scoobydoo gang are older than teenagers in the movies and are only teenagers in a few select canon content. so a show for adults technically aged the gang down and perverted them. yikes
why could they have just made him ace
I hope this hsow tanks as much as santa inc did.
love the hoodie.. that alone got my like and sub.
you never see daphne naked in the old cartoons. these idiots are tearing apart classic character s just like they ve been doing for many years... they just go further and further with each iteration of the slow destruction of classic s.
when this show bombs we all know who they ll blame and how
you know what would be cool  an alterentive universe where scooby is gone and all the member after that hate each other and goes in their own way  try to solve the same mistery with diffrent angles and they cross each other and.. drama
there are better ways to make an adult version of scooby-doo than this. I could brainstorm for half a day and come up with better ideas
could someone take the writers and executives of hbo  and other such entities  behind the wood shed    hint  the wood shed need not be standing when finished  as old and decrepit as I am  I ll still rebuild it for you.
why they do my man fred like that he isn t like that at all he loves his team and he could never steal there credit and Jesus Im starting to hate this show already I know I ll have to watch it to see if it doesnt make me even more disappointed but damn
at the same time  it doesnt hurt to give a character more of a personality than flawless guy everyone likes  the original fred was pretty emotionless one note and dull  there s been a million interpretations of these characters  I dont mind them doing something different
can you imagine people planning for a huge group of scooby doo fans to bum rush hbomax headquarters to delete all traces of the velma show. lol never happen but funny thought.
the woke dont care about good writing  they just want stuff to reinforce their moral narcissism. anybody who knows the lore understands that fred has never taken credit  he s always lifted his friends up. once again the fans have to humble these pretenders who ve corrupted another good franchise.
every change that this show runner has made to the characters has been centered around sex. scooby doo always had little to no sexual content in the first iteration and there have been very very minor increases in the concept in the show as it developed  but this is just out and out trying to make sex the core component of the plot of the show. so horrible to see every single show that comes out have sex be the main focus.
they put fred as the   the white who loves to take credit for everyone s work  completely the same way they are doing to this cartoon. make your own cartoon dammit!
this is like drake and euphoria....completely perverted.
its arbitrary. the legal line is right there in the teens. this feels like a bit of reach. you dont really seem genuinely upset.
they should have made mystery inc 3
there have bern spin offs where other members like daphne have been leaders where fred and velma were missing like the 13th ghosts of scooby-doo and other shows.
fred is the father figure of scooby doo  and he is a leader.  the target audience is literally prepubescent children  it is why the show is so sketchy  because for real full-grown adults  it isn t interesting   and that is why the popular mystery machine team didn t focus upon sexuality.  to claim fred never went through puberty is an incel  involuntary celibate   and this is wickedness and open dishonesty by vindictive perversion.  in the scooby doo Bible  they are all beyond high school  and they are young adults.  daphne is the mother figure  and she is the rich girl  who apparently pays for everything.  in the past  daphne has bee portrayed as some kind of reporter  where it is the rich who become reporters in modern american media.  both fred and daphne make all group decisions  as the father and mother figures of the team.  why hbo wants velma to be the center of attention is bizarre  because it appears as the director and writer inserting themselves in the story  that isn t good storytelling.  the famous kurt vonnegut jr.  who wrote the famous slaughterhouse five book  said dont worry about inserting yourself into the story  just write  where many writers want to be a story character  instead of making something entertaining.
they re saying that fred has erectile dysfunction... hasn t hit purity yet  his secret getting harder and harder to hide  daphne being bored with over the close things.... meaning she wants to have sex.
wrongly imprisoned for murder. thats pretty dark for scooby do lol
wasn t that the movie plot  they all went their separate way after scrappy-doo pulled some shit and caused drama in the gang  just for them to all be invited to a amusement part on a island to investigate a curse or something
@jorendo  tbh I didn t watch the movie but I thought if they were going to do a  adult show  they could go with this.
@jorendo  Ima go watch it lol
what s worse is that they deaged the characters so now they are sexualizing minors
@red ram  thats not cool! like why sexualize a high school girl  its one thing to have characters in their 20s involved in sexual situations in a tv show  which in itself is already crazy enough . however  when you have a character that is like 14 or 15  that is rather disgusting and horrifying.
fred is getting the worst thing. especially given they said he was the only one  defined by his whiteness
I agree everything you said
fred  the strapping young lad that works out  hasn t hit puberty. biology doesnt work like that...
Im not against the idea of an adult version of scooby doo but this one looks like its going to be a bust.
am I the only one thats semI excited for this   as a scooby-doo fan I love all different kinds of scooby-doo like what s new scooby-doo scooby-doo where are you get a clue scooby-doo and etc so Im curious on how this will come out. the only issue is I hate whenever they ship fred and daphne together cuz like they re so boring as a couple and have zero chemistry itseems forced I want velma and fred to get together. or fred and shaggy get together and daphne and velma get together they seem better off paired then velma and shaggy and fred and daphne all together cuz its like no chemistry and just seems forced like I get it popular girls supposed to go with the jock boy. nerd is supposed to go with the geek   weirdo but Im just like thats too boring make it better  give me some excitement in my life make the popular girl get with the nerd or the jock get with the nerd and the weirdo get with the popular girl or the jock get with the weirdo
man I just want mystery incorporated s3
we never have to guess as in clandestine activity  the politics are applied so brightly that  we need sunglasses to look at them
who the hell keeps greenlighting this sh t    I swear  I want to find and interrogate them. who did what to you that made you okay with any of this!
seriously what is wrong with these people.....what did fred ever do to them.
if they wanted to do an adult show why didn t they make it a college setting  wouldn t be that bad to do
mindy kaling is the kind of person to completely misjudge everyone based on whether or not they are a white man  the exception being if they are gay or trans  its very concerning that people like this are taking over very well-known characters like this. I hope her  interpretation  doesnt become the norm for the mystery inc. gang.
yeah I ll stick with mystery incorporated and the movies thank you very much lol
itspeaks volumes that they always seem to pervert the shows that are aimed at kids....
I swear if this is a spoof pilot
what is it with creators nowadays making things so much more negative than they need to be. I always remembered after as a very positive  uplifting person. why do they need to change that  ugh
isnt it great that a plot point in character development is who and who wont they fuck  progress!
fred and shaggy are only men after all  its not like it matters what happens to them.
hollywood will not stop until they destroy everything from our childhoods. the only thing we can do is just not give them any attention or money. eventually they will stop or disappear. im fine with either.
step 1  take an animated franchise that has been successful for half a century.step 2  narrow your target audience.step 3  make drastically unnecessary changes to the characters.step 4  leave out the character most loved by the fans.step 5  if everything goes wrong  you simply blame those who didn t like it with terms that end with  ist  or  phobic  suffixes to cover up your mediocrity and lack of creativity as a screenwriter.
you sound tired and bored by this story  we can all relate.
Imentioned it before but what made fred the leader was because he was the guy who kept the coolest head.
the rampant sexualization of daphne is why my parents didn t let me watch scooby doo  they had me watch south park instead!said no parent ever...
so fred  takes credit for everyone elses work and is fortunately  wrongly convicted of murder  so he s clearly set up to be a white punching bag  yet the velma character who is literally just the writer with velma s clothes on falls for this half baked fred character this just reads like a bad fanfiction.
they were so focused on being woke  they didn t realize they changing shaggy  the guy who s heavily implied to be a stoner  into a black man would be  in their very own words   problematic .
why cant they just solve mysteries bro like what is all this shit
when these weirdos insult men for sexualizing women  its not actually counter-logical that they make fun of supposed incels. its just disgusting and unnecessary. when they bully men for being incels  they re acknowledging that those men still sexualize women  but that cant act on it. that gives these types of women a feeling of catharsis thatsomehow an evil objectifier of women is defeated. so they mock those men like its a victory dance.
how are these writers getting these jobs   do the big companies actually think these are good ideas
I know fred isn t exactly my favorite character out of the gang but he certainly doesnt deserve this kind of treatment not by a light year
guys I think Ive come up with a solution.   if we keep pitching bad ideas for shows no one will watch then eventually the networks will go bankrupt. they re all too stupid to say no to garbage writing at this point. here s my pitch we remake the flintstones and make fred a fat incel gamer. wilma is actually fred s  femboss at the quarry and doesnt need no time for her kids because she s got her career. at this point they ve aged pebbles and bam bam to young adults in college who major in dino bestiality rights. both become violent dino bestiality activist even though barney is that happy go lucky non binary dad that keeps teaching bam bam that violence is wrong and he shouldn t be hitting people with his club because its toxic masculinity. betty one day looks on pebbles instagram twitter accounts and learns about only fans then becomes influenced to try it with dino. and at the end of each episode there s no moral of the story other than make everything gay. haven t figured out who is going to get race swapped just for the heck of it yet but you can bet your bottom dollar that it ll be essential to their identity. post your reboot pitches in this comment thread. drink some gender fluid and get creative guys.
all thats left   replace scooby with scrappy.
no wonder the creator of this show got into film  she loves to project.
they try and say all men are perverted and disgusting and to show this they change up a character who s good representation of what to be like  not perverted kind and caring  and change it into something badshouldn t it be better to have a character to look up to rather than to look down on
worst thing is they age them down form 17 18 to 15 16
fred... the guy who always paired himself up with a girl... to be alone with his girlfriend... didn t go through puberty he is drawn wide chested and tall... he definately has testosterone
as soon as they mention eric trump in fred s description  you already know they have other motives than to make a whole heartedly good show. and you know the creator is gonna respond to the hate comments by calling everybody racist and sexist.
actual fred   great work gang! we solved the mystery! the actual gang   yeah we did! let s go celebrate together! hbo   what an asshole. take all the credit much ! Jesus what a misogynistic racist. by the way daphne  you never had any value in the original besides looks so we are gonna give you some more character elements so there s less focus on your body....also hbo  draw the opening scene with underage daphne naked. that ll show em!
so where is scooby  they took him out completely
yikes are they really gonna sideline fred  scooby got deleted  fred isn t even part of the group  daphne is totally ironically powered down. they re so out of touch with the actual lore. this just feels like a self insert for velma  plus the fantasy of being the main character. the thing is  who s going to watch it if they re only targeting people who only relate to velma
this is why you dont hire tumblr fanfiction people
you know fred was a pretty geeky jock Imean look who he hangs out with
velma   jinkies! now we get to find out who the real villain is...  pulls the mask off   oh its some white guy
honestly  Im surprised they didn t just go all in on this and swap the race and gender of fred too. Imean  they literally changed everyone else completely. why not ruin fred too  actually.....on second thought....I know why. they need at least one white guy there so they can lay all the blame on him when things go tits up  and blame him for all of the teams problems.
I dare say the original series  zombie island and be school are the best scooby series
could have literally just introduced new characters to the team who stay and are always there now instead of trying to separate everyone by race swapping
epic bruh moment
and.........it just gets worse and worse. they are ruining all the characters at this point. scooby-doo was my 2nd fav non-anime cartoon when growing up and itstill is. this depresses me. the more franchises that I love that get ruined  the more depressed I get. we aren t allowed to enjoy anything anymore. just stick with the retro stuff  ya ll!
honestly even the be cool scooby doo is better than this. yes its a good example of a modern adaptation but with minor changes. daphne doesnt have a crush on fred and instead has weird quirks. for example having puppets and a rival to fred. fred in this has a backstory on why he always likes solving mysteries and even has imperfections. for example tired of the gangs shenanigans and is like the tired dad. hell you could even see fred having a grudge on raccoons on the classic universe of a Christmas carol. shaggy and scooby are aware they are teh baits of monsters of the week and had added interesting quirks about them. for example paying instruments and even has great distractions for the monsters. velma is still the nerd and a smart one. but well you need to be aware. there is an episode on where velma is frustrated because she doesnt know why a yetI try to attack a cheese restaurant. and you dont want an angry velma.
2 objections. 1. they cant ruin scooby since he s not in it.2. they can ruin scrappy because he cant get any worse.   2 isnt a challenge.
boy 2020 is  pretty terrible ain t it
its amazing how much it bothers people now a days for some characters in a series to be white. I truly believe that  it takes away from the history of the characters. people will look back on this in shame and think how silly this moment it time was. promise!
I have one show that comes to mind. big mouth.  lol
there is not one time fred has taken credit for others work. not once. a real fan would know. and I am a real fan and know ha
this isn t a cartoon intended to entertain  its just mindy s animated twitter rants.
the worst part about it is how its really destroying our childhood with this. taking our favorite characters and making them unrecognizable. I dont wanna see the mystery gang going through highschool dealings with issues that are all about lgbt and racial controversies  I wanna see them solve mysteries and unmask bad guys. fucking ridiculous what they do to our childhood shows
with velma being gay and having a crush on fred  can velma not be bI  not that I think itshould be focused on in a fun kids show meant to distract people from real life and the stress of school life.
I always tell myself that these people who do this kinda content making new or renewing old ones to this will eventually go extinct due to lack of breeding but I was soon taught  evil is not born  it is taught
why  fred ain t even a typical jock!
new video. great!
love how hbo put all the douchey  daddy issues character archetype on a white dude  says it all right therealso  Im 19  Ive never even spoken to a girl  and I bet at least half of my peers have never even had sex while in school college  brI ish college  not american  either  so I dont know why these writers think every teen has sex at some point in that time comes from! what perverts!
to me the worst part is I know they wont change. they will see the bad reviews and just assume everyone in the world is racist and then move on to the next project. its disgusting  but its the honest truth.
there is an adult version already its called scooby doo a xxx parody.
except in the shitty james gunn movies
@helder oliveira  which was not accurate to the character  just like this. what I got from this new show is they are basing it off of only the live action stuff  in which they aren t even accurate to that either.
I d say there s at least a 50 50 shot that fred will end up becoming trans in this series.
all those  good work gang  s and they re trying to say he takes all the credit
fred s flaw was making bad decisions  let s split up squad  but he typically treated everyone on the team respectfully. also  you shouldn t make tv show about everything everyone does... no one wants to see a show about me eating two dozen tacos and its aftermath... well  I hope no one wants to watch that. I wondered why they didn t race swap fred cause making the athletic  charismatic guy would make more sense to change then slacker hippy guy with a dog... oh what there is no dog. I haven t even seen an episode and I hate the show.
it used to be that hollywood would make shows for regular people and they would keep their hedonistic lifestyle and attitudes out of their work. now all their freak flags are flying and the new shows reflect how they actually think.
they made glenn howerton do this  but you cantell he has no where near the emotion he has in any other show. he s getting a pay check  he s not allowed to comment on the writing  even though he is funnier than all of the writers put together.
Im so mad its like they never even watched the original scooby doo where are you. these characters are wonderful and a huge part of my childhood because me and my sister were obsessed with scooby doo. there was nothing wrong with the characters! they were great. Im so horrified at this description of the new fred . so gross I cant even keep watching this video Im sorry Im so mad
fortunately  fred is wrongly imprisoned for murders he didn t commit.  hold up...  fortunately   they do realize prison messes up everyone  right aside from that  good Lord  the picture needs an editor for all the grammatical mistakes. also  uh  why the   in white
the way I see it everything we grew up watching will get trashed
we dont hate men . yeah right  as if you could convince anyone of that.
fred is actually a transman  shaggy is a furry. there s no scooby in the show because they had to put down scooby after it lived a healthy life.
her thoughts and emotions have value   self-insert much  was that written by the unpopular girl who s convinced she s actually great and the bestest ever and if the hot guy would just have his life shattered  seriously   fortunately  he s put in jail    he d just realise this
I like how they say he s a gym rat but he looks skinny  and not even lean. straight up like doesnt do anything
daphne wasn t eye candy!  she was a valued member of the group who was also physically attractive!   do people like mindy kaling think attractive people do not exist
my cousin  ayo shaggy black nowme  but why
but fred never took all credit  he was always encouraging   congratulating the others. this  woke  garbage has taken all the team aspect out of the story  but what should we expect when they remove scooby. no scooby no story.
just watch  they re gonna change scooby doo into a female chihuahua who was abused and spayed by her previous owners and now has trust issues with humans  men  because of it and has to learn how to trust again. but  has an even darker secret.
our fred is a white guy who loves to take credit for everyone else s work.  iirc  wasn t it fred who set up the traps to catch the monsters
whose the blond guy who hurt them so they cantake it out on fred
this shows a complete lack of understanding of the characters but I ain t gonna lie  Im intrigued. I feel like this show could be a fun watch as long as the comedy actually lands.
gdI dennis  I will be calling nu-fred thatsince he s voiced by the iasip dude.
oh  well teenagers just do that. teenagers have sex anyway. yeah  do you know why they do that  because teenagers are naive  short-sighted  and emotionally underdeveloped. they only care about their immediate interests and desires  and they lack the the maturity   life experience to understand how that decision could potentially affect them late on in life. even putting aside physical health  there s the consequences it can leave on someone s mind. many people do not seem to be aware of the fact thatsex can have a negative impact on you mentally  and that can be especially damaging for someone who s too young to process those emotions.are they going to make the same arguments about drugs and teen pregnancies  next   I probably shouldn t even ask - they likely already are doing that.
soooo here we all still think that the only good reboot scooby doo ever had was mistery inc.  my boy fred was the main character without even realizing it
calling this show a dumpster fire waiting to happen would be offensive to the dumpster and the fire
I allways thought of the human part of the scooby squad as 20  year olds.
caring for ppl in group and noticing the strengths of everyone in said group and weaknesses. also am I the only one tired of everyone hating on straight white males.
just a swell guy .   Im 50 and am shocked to hear someone use the word swell...
I hate the  its realistic  excuse. people take each other into eternity via guns every day. should we be holding that up as  good
I didn t hear you mention what fred s big secret is. is he going to come out of the closet now  wouldn t that just be so typical of hollywood these days. its becoming clich .
they re destroying my favorite childhood show.. my God.  Imean the show was goofy and not perfect but that was part of the charm.
want adult scooby doo make a show where their 18 or grown up in the college years
bruh why are they turning fred into a total douch when he was one of the nicest people despite being a jock  I hate these stupid stereotypes
I like your breaking benjamin hoodie where d you get it
I will not react nor watch this show. this is all their tactic  draw up controversy  disrespect the audience and the history of the franchise  all the hope that you will tune in. only one problem  it wont work.
shows like big mouth barely get by with their perverted portrayal by being completely meta with their delivery.  this show continues to sound like its going to take itself seriously  the hbo max tweet from the trailer aside  which just make it worse in the grand scheme of the project.  its hard for me to remember another show thats made me hate it more and more with every new bit of info that comes out about it.  oh wait...kevin smith s masters of the universe.
well  people dont like leaders due to the fact that they are a bunch of followers of course  I was always told as a kid to be a leader and dont be a follower.  - if that triggers somebody well thatsounds like a personal problem.
I canceled hbomax and never looked back.
the way they are treating these characters are just jokes and memes people have had about them for decades.  none of this was really supposed to be.  they are only jokes about the characters.  I guess shaggy is going to be a major stoner or someone with a drug problem.
so fred is a jock gym rat......but also hasn t gone through puberty  do they not know what puberty does
I love this woman.
all I gotta say is if shaggy is black now. they gonna play more into him being a stoner  that would be funny as hell in my opinion.
I got it from their merch shop at a breaking benjamin concert a few years ago
me too
mindy kaling has done the impossible! she did worse than the curse of scrappy doo.
they want adults to be kids with child like minds  why do you think they re coming  with a adult happy meal at mcdonald s crazy
he s supposed to be a goofy  jock character who just likes sports and never takes advantage of his popularity.
did I imagine this  did I imagine this  fred had already been emasculated  now what canthey doo  this makes tghe second .second hb franchise to yogi..
this just isn t scooby doo!!!  I get its supposed to be an  adult version  but if they wanted to make an adult version make the characters adults cause otherwise its creepy. on another note they clearly they hate every scooby doo character so what was the point in using them for your show   would it be so hard to make a new mystery show with all the same looking characters that they now have and  call itsomething else   all they have to do is make them adults solving mysteries and murders or whatever make them meet in a strange way or have flashbacks to how they met in high school and  boom there s a whole new show. and it took me all of 8 seconds to come up with.   I just dont get the point of making a show when you clearly hate the characters. to me  honestly this feels like what hbo did to the harley quinn series. trying to make harley and poison ivy cannon in the way they did just felt gross. I was all for harley and ivy being canon in a series of done right. but the whole show was quite gross  when they literally could ve copy and pasted harley quinn s comic as a show and it would ve been great. Im sure most people aren t me and didn t read her comic so it would seem like something new and awesome  I actually  quite enjoyed her comic where she was doing roller derby and stuff and on her own no more joker. instead we got that piece of hot garbage. its just like they cant do anything without ruining the characters almost on purpose. maybe Im still a kid at heart  in certain ways maybe its the adhd and I never rly grew out of childlike things or maybe Im  just nostalgic but Im so sick of hollywood ruining all of my favorite things.
why did they do this we got tyron with a power level of 1.5discount daphne with no skillthe black cringe twitter user who failed a grade and a insure teen who is just inunfortunate meanwhile ultra instinct chick magnet shaggy trap master fred who is a little oblivious velma a genius scholar and hacker and daphne who can beat knights and wrestlers with her martial arts plus  they have scooby do
to be honest I dont think even perverts want this and are disgusted by this terrible idea of a scooby doo show.
can we just pretend this doesnt exict
I dont see how anybody read the descriptions of the characters and the script for the show and decided to sign on...I feel like nobody should watch this and if they do  just watch it on some free website because my God they need to be shown that the garbage they have been shitting out is the opposite of what they are trying to achieve. did anybody else get a fan fiction vibe from the   he quickly realizes her thoughts and emotions have value
so where is scooby
dude  it is funny that the article said  ...riddle with daddy issues big enough to make eric trump say  damn  . lol. I think hunter biden definitely fits better in that phrase.
modern entertainment is literally killing strong male characters  its crazy! in fact they dont want strong female characters either  they want everyone genderless basically or gender swapped. thats why I loved the witcher and house of dragons  daimon  which give us fascinating  strong men! vikings is another great one  hollywood please give us more stong masculine men in our shows and movies!
whats this trend with western shows and being woke extremely hostile to its  audiance  not comprehending that  representation  is not simply using a fill bucket over an existing character and reducing said character to nothing but their race or orientation.
I honestly hope we re just being trolled.
this all sounds like a rip-off of the james gunn live action movie. fred stealing credit and velma feeling unappreciated was already done in that film and done better. and why would fred s concern while he s been framed and put in jail be focused on velma s thoughts and feelings  also having daphne pressuring fred into having sex when he s insecure about his body feels really messed up and hypocritical of the writers.
there was a thing on twitter that got deleted thatsaid fred was gonna come out as trans later in the series
the moment they mentioned daddy issues and eric trump in the same sentence I knew which political party rebooted this.... y all really getting predictable af with this forceful woke shit yo
well  now that daphne has the option between fried chicken and fish how long will it take for fred to be portrayed as an incel
only a truly inhumane  evil person would call someone getting wrongfully imprisoned for murder  fortunately.  like  emasculating him  making him an eric trump allegory  and making him the  one who needs to learn a lesson  are pathetic things  but being imprisoned for murder  even wrongfully  can ruin your life. especially if you are in the public eye like being in sports or dating a popular person or have overbearing parents. never is that a  fortunately.  this character they re making could easily be driven to suicide by this description.I said it the last scooby doo video  and I repeat it here. canthese people just go die  yes  thats harsh. yes  thats taking it really far. but these people are so inhumane  they are taking a children s show  slandering it  and changing it to preach genuinely evil messages. this is literally like taking sesame street and using it to preach kids to be genuinely  hurtfully racist and sexist. anyone willing to do this does not deserve life.
hbo s scooby doo is far left fanfic similar to twilight novels writing.
I hated what they did in the harley quinn show  batman was basically ruined  looks like they just love to destroy classic characters.
@jh565bb  yea they really messed up bruce I dont use this word at all but they basically made bruce into a beta male when we all know the real bruce isn t like that I really dont like how they potrayed his and cat woman s relationship they made him act obsessive and clingy.
literally that whole show was such a mess I 100  agree about bruce
lol good point!
why not just make a new show I dont understand the logic of hijacking a show just to change it
its really infuriating to see a beloved kids show be turned into some gore mild porn fanfiction to push some  woke  narrative. this new  woke  scooby doo series is insulting to the original creators of the show and to fans who cherished it. fred is a decent human being and leader who cared about his team and even rewarded shaggy and scooby by giving scooby snacks for doing a task. he s not a jerk with  daddy issues . daphine is a lovely character who has scottish heritage. see the movie scooby and the loch ness monster. she also has abilities to help. why does every child s show have to be oversexualized by perverts  its disturbing.
its like they didn t even watch the shows...
poor fred being completely destroyed by these weird woke sjw types. thatshow is gonna be pure cringe
at this point  just dont give it the time. I think the whole series is going to be built on outrage  hatred   baiting.it needs our hatred to justify itself.
scooby doo  an all white character cartoon  came on saturday mornings. also on saturday mornings around the same time was fat albert   all black   the jackson 5  all black   and the harlem globetrotters   all black  and no one cared. 50 years later people that weren t even born yet have problems with tv kids  shows from the 1970s. good grief.
the reason thatscooby-doo is not in this velma series is because asian daphne and black stoner shaggy ate him! thats my theory anyway.
I agree with everything aside of a 16 year old being a child. a 16 year old can legally marry  produce children  work and even drive a car in some countries. in no way is a 16 year old a child. I was 16 myself and if someone would have called me a child I would have punched them in the face.
they would make scooby gay if they were really about it lol
if you cant or wont use scooby-doo in the series then maybe just use a new ip. also self insert velma mindy so cringe. Im a huge scooby fan and have watched the different series multiple times since childhood so you think I d be one of the target audiences
hey  if you dont like what you see in the new animated scooby doo movie or velma series trailers  thats ok. they aren t for you.you have had 60 years of scooby doo series and movies. no one is taking that away from you.these are for other people. people that dont look or love exactly like you.the producers saw fit to give them this. its a tiny drop in the bucket compared to what they have given you.let s be gracious about it.
canthese companies please leave classic characters alone   people like mindy shouldn t even be allowed to remake the show and its characters into something they aren t  sadly once hanna barbera died  the entire company did and the new bafoons running it you cantell they sadly obviously dont care about protecting their characters from crap like this and they continue to spit on them with these new terrible insulting reboots like the new scoob! jellystone  yabba dabba dinosoars  wacky races  so sadly they got away with this garbage now as they clearly dont care  dont worry guys  this reboot is gonna fail hard as usual by the true fans like us  keep it going guys  we ll show them and it wont even last long because of us  one day hollywood will understand to leave these things alone  first velma is completely something else and now fred  he was the perfect leader who never left anyone out  why change that  shaggy I can kinda understand being dumb at times  but fred  no  thats not his character  you dont change that either. remember the characters from  the racoons  sadly they are on the same boat as this and are next  as we all know the originals from the original 80 s specials and shows  the characters were loved by many fans  especially bert  he was clumsy  dorky  and sweet  which made him adorable  but with the new reboot coming out with the new terrible re-designs  I fear especially bert in this new version will end up like fred in this  re-written to be something else entirely like the rest of the cast with these terrible new re-designs  but also  dumber than his original self and a punching bag  not only thats bad  but unfortunately len carlson  his og va died some time ago   I can only imagine with everything being so off about him and the rest of the cast for the reboot already how his new va and voice is gonna be  probably a complete insult towards him and his og character its nice the original creator kevin gills is behind it though thats the good thing  but honestly just one look at the new version is pretty similar to this  and looks pretty bad  honestly though its so sad they have to change these decade old characters everyone loved into something they aren t for these reboots  there s no reason to  it only upsets the original fans and turns everything about the show into something its not.    first jellystone  yabba dabba dinosoars  scoob!  and now this.  luckily no matter how hard they try to unfortunately ruin all these franchises  they can never beat the original of any show.
oh so its the premise of she s all that... popular guy meets the not so popular girl  its funny cuz the guy is freddie prince.
there is nothing wrong with the gang being different races  except fred  he is the big  kinda dumb but always kind average white guy. end of story lol   but this is just weird. they re changing their characters entirely. especially shaggy gets me. its not that he s black  its that he s apparently all confidence and like just a stoner dude. thats not shaggy  thats cliche stoner. with more nervousness and anxiety and maybe even  as someone suggested  with scooby as a service dog  he d be better. but yeah this just isn t scooby and they re disrespecting the fans by mocking them  what s a scoob  is written on the mailbox . they should ve just made a completely original show instead of just disrespecting and turning the show into something it isn t. I want to be optimistic  as I loved mystery inc and it was like a reboot but it was always faithful and I love it. even the live action films  despite their flaws  always felt genuine and respectful too. this  isn t either.
heyyy I see that breaking benjamin hoodie! guess I should ask  when did you discover them and what do they mean to you  favorite song album
its not about destroying your favorite tv shows  its about destroying the family
I feel sorry for kids today  when I grew up watching scooby doo and other such programs it was just about entertaining us  watching something both funny and spooky  now its all about brainwashing and spreading thier toxic  sick ideology.
you ll probably hate anime for what they do to teen characters
how did they get permission to change these characters
thank you so much for all you do. telling people the facts might piss some off but your standing for what s right and what s total propaganda leftist shit
whoever created this has a bad cause of main character syndrome
I think wokesters despise classically handsome men because they never dated any. this is their revenge by proxy.
the 80s called. they want their reagenite propaganda back.
I love anime lol. I dont watch the ecchI stuff though. also their culture is different with a different age of consent. obviously I dont agree though.thatsaid  darling in the franxx is around my limit  anything much beyond that I dont watch
I know right
I dont have a problem with the characters being switch to a different ethnicity its actually interesting but when you change the whole concept about the show then you might as well make your own show instead of using a popular known show to spread your message. scooby doo is about friends hanging out and protecting each other while solving mysteries they are lovable because they explore that rebel side in all of us in how we explore with our friends and get in adventures. its not about who s gay who s not daddy issues or does he smoke weed or not or who s she fucking  is fred gay what is this show.
teenagers do many things... but a childrens cartoon doesnt need to show everything a teenager does.
they re just ruining all of our childhoods.
fred was never a gym rat jock type. he was in shape sure but he s an engineering geek who loves traps. this characterization is a total bastardization and character assassination. and why the fuck are they getting wierdly sexual with teenage characters  at least the movies had the gang as adults for all their innuendo. for fucks sake wb
really wondering if this show was created as either a tax writeoff or a money laundering scheme
when was fred ever the type to take credit for everyones work  the only version like that is the crappy first live action film with crappy cgImonsters that made scrappy a super evil villain.funny enough that film also pissed all over the characters.
them -  we loved scooby-doo growing up proceeds to change every aspect of the characters that made the show what it was.gotta love the fact that the juvenile characters are being sexualized by the creators and totally accepted by everyone involved. the idea of   this is for adults   is totally wrong when you are sexualizing juveniles. seems like pushing the agenda of maps over the word pedophile.looking at fred s  bio   would not be surprised if they decide to make fred transgender.
this isn t the scooby gang. its a random band of people hanging out with the same names  .
so fred has a secret  hasnt gone through puberty  his secret is getting harder to hide... he s definitely  gay  trans or both. Im very sure thats what they re doing if this show doesnt get cancelled before
no surprise there lol.they take over the franchisees because they do hate some of the characters. its about the message.
reading the whole  fred hasn t gone through puberty yet   Ive always been fascinated with feminism s hatred of masculinity but also like to dunk on less macho guys. seems counterproductive to me
only thing good about this is the almost universal backlash this is getting. they really picked the wrong franchise to do this to.
sounds to me a little too  trollish  to be true. anyway if he looks that big before puberty  imagine what he ll look like after!
ya know  the funniest thing when it comes to  double standards  is that  they fault men for having an  attitude  and being strong willed and such  which oftentimes coincides with leadership qualities. but at the same time praise these traits  when it comes to  modern day  3rd wave feminist women... all that while forgetting that those traits aren t automatically tied to character traits like narcissism  sexism and generally ignorant behavior.and even though im not ignorant enough to the fact that these traits can come hand in hand  why is it  that only men get called out for it  what was the apparently much loved term for that nowadays  toxic  I dont see society call out  brave   strong  narcissistic  intolerant types of women to be called out for being as @ les or being sidelined  but to now even use these types of well known characters and shit on them  to fulfil some perverted form of social justice on cartoon men  I suppose by the end of this fred has the character of a  wet sock  when they are finished... totally fu-ed up if you ask me.and the absolute worst is  that modern day show runners are apparently so dumb  that they aren t even understanding that  with all those  problematic  traitsall of these characters had  both the male and female  they showed that they still worked together and got along. because in the end a single  irritating  traitsimply doesnt make you a bad person. it was even a clever tool to inject  friction  interesting points of discussion  conflict and in the end tolerance and understanding between the characters for their individual uniqueness.which even brought the characters closer together as friends and as a team.
this is all messed up but hey  david tennent is back as doctor who lets give that power and let this show choke on isolation
x  if this is perverse and disgusting  dont watch anime you ll have a heart attack x
man it makes me feel really weird that glenn howerton decided he wanted to be a part of this bullshit.  its always sunny  is the farthest from woke censored thing that exists  and for someone who helped create and write all of it to take a paycheck on something terrible like this  is sad.
hey. its fred!
so when do we get to the true evil of this series  black cowardly stoner shaggy!
liking the bb top.
next up we ll find out thatscooby is really a furry who works for the biden administration.
this is an insult to hanna barra s original characters  shows I grew up watching and hearing them being devolved into this disgusting state all to fit in with current events infuriates me.
well you know the saying we all love..  you go woke  you go broke.  I ll drink to their inevitable doom at the box office.
Im pretty sure this show is what would be played in my own personal hell. I hate it more than a nuclear war with russia.
scooby-doo doo...
at least anime usualy waits until their 17 before the  I fell on some girl and accidentally  got a feel   happens  yet for some reason anime is the degenerate.
hey mate - I dont normally try to standout like this  but the show is satire. satire  the use of humor  irony  exaggeration  or ridicule to expose and criticize people s stupidity or vices  particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. it is there to be a satirical show to make fun of all the other remakes that exist. you are aware of that right
if im not mistaken fred was the one that always came up with the traps to catch the bad guy and velma was the one that did the digging and daphne had good self defense and scooby and shaggy where the ones that didn t really do anything and I dont ever remember fred ever taking credit from anyone and sense when does him being a white guy have to do with anything there ruining every good kids show with a bunch of woke crap
its almost refreshing when they dont even try to hide the ball. the scorn and perversion is just out in the open. any backlash at all is just lumped together  labeled  far-right outrage   and even worked into the marketing. targeting kids that are just addicted to the screen is nothing new though.
remember when tv shows were fun    at least now I know where satan sleeps to night
I just dont know how much longer these establishments think they can keep up with this woke garbage. velma will collapse in the first season  like she-hulk and trop. they re hemorrhaging money out of every orifice and they still keep doing it...
I agree with just about everything you said for the first 12 minutes 40 seconds of this video.well done. this show looks horrible  what they ve done to the characters is unconscionable and despicable. but I will take a stand against saying  sex in content for adults is pervy .this show may cross the line into  pervy  but that isn t what you meant when you used the word.you said adults dont need to see sex in everything made for adults  true  and its usually just gross and pervy  false  and made for other perverts  false .it is occasionally gross  usually in the horror genre or thrillers about serial killers and such. it is occasionally pervy  usually in thrillers about perverts.to be clear  I am using the term  pervert  to mean what it really means  a person whose sexual behavior is regarded as abnormal and unacceptable.you are using the term to mean a person who like sex. your version is a perversion of the word  pervert . youre not using the word correctly.a man who likes having sex with women is not a pervert.a man who has lots of sex with women is not a pervert.a woman who has lots of sex with men is not a pervert.there was a time when gay sex was considered perverted and even today a few narrow minded people cling to that view  but most people no longer call gay men perverts.people who like to watch tv shows or movies where grown adults have consensual sex onscreen are not perverts.all of this is normal. to be a pervert  you have to be abnormal.for you to publicly call normal people  perverts  because they like normal sex or they like watching normal sex is wrong.its judgmental.its just plain wrong.you do you. you like what you want to like and thats ok. but dont call the majority of the world  perverts  just because they like normal things and you dont like those things.
that whole  show  is an insult to scooby doo
the writer really wrote velma as her self insert and made her be the most important thing in the show. thats not the point of fucking scooby doo
go get em and keep calling it out.
if youre an adult who has to see sex in everything  including imposing it on children s stories  youre not an adult. youre not showing your worldliness  youre showing how limited you are.
they cant even do woke right! they should ve made fred  a self confident leader  the black dude and left shaggy and scooby as stoner white goofballs for comedic relief from the fucking lecture that will likely be each episode. velma was almost always the brains behind who the big bad was  fred was the brains for the trap and scooby and shaggy were bait and daphne would fit into one of those roles depending on the episode  from my memory this was how 9 10 episodes played out. I dont even care about the race of the characters  you cant fucking drop scooby from scooby doo and you shouldn t make a show just to piss off the og fans  lecture them in the trailer  and than say because people dont like it they re  fill-in-the-blank -ist. of course if these new shows didn t pull this under handed shit than they would all be forgotten.
how do you emasculate a guy who wears a neck scarf all the time
Imean someone had to be the evil white man in their story right  fits with the mcu phase 4 standard of  men are bad unless they are a minority  and women  good or bad are good.  literally changed the entire cast except for freddy. I was legit excited to watch this. not anymore.
fortunately he is wrongfully accused of murders  so....shes happy he was wrongfully accused
this is definitely flanderism  and yeah  its not all that different from other adult shows  except those shows will be straightforward that their political commentary should not be taken seriously.this is as if a middle schooler self-inserted themselves and their friends  and used this show as a means to vent  but that wouldn t explain the perversion and hypocrisy per-say. its more like intellectual sabotage  or perhaps negligence  but at this point  negligence and sabotage should mean the same thing to warner brothers.
venture bros was a satire that was obviously parodying johnny quest  as well as tropes of 60 s cartoons in general. it didn t take johnny quest and put swear words in a kids show  it took him figuratively and made him r rated-but not literally.if they want to do something that is like a self aware  adult scooby doo  then they need a parody  not a remake or reimagining. create something new thats an obvious parody  people have been doing it for all time.we can have an adult show that throws some shade at what its parodying. itchy and scratchy from the simpsons was doing that with tom and jerry.
anyone know if the writers for woke shit add sex offender or convicted of sex offender as job experience or job title. maybe even as some kind of clout
this stuff is why I dont watch anything anymore. games have been tainted with all this trash just the same. apparently many books have gotten really awful as well  which is why Im trying to find a publisher for my manuscript. when you want it done right  y know  God willing its a good story and someone decides to publish it. would love to give folks something to enjoy.
I kept saying this  but I swear these people have never watched any of the other series that came before this. why hire people that hate these characters to make a new show about them.
I totally agree with them fetishizing teenagers. this show clearly has an agenda. I absolutely despise that they replaced shaggy... just make a whole new crew with new characters!
I dont know what fred did to mindy but she hates fred. fred was a little clueless but he was the trap loving guy who was the human equivalent of a golden retriever.they made him dumb  narcissistic  a bit of a psycho  racist and they constantly every chance they get make fun of him having a small dick.like wtf  this is the mindy show with self insertion and horrible fanfic writing. horrible  no relation to the scooby do franchise. this is the mindy show  not velma and never will be.
in school I never was a fan of the jocks and pretty girls. disgusting  mean people who like nothing more than to put other people down. but its things like this though that make me think  maybe its a good thing the geeks and freaks dont have any power or influence. when they do  you get weird shit like this.
they could of just made a whole new show instead of ruining beloved characters
what are they doing to my boy
whats sad is reelfx s latest cg scooby doo film was good and respected the original content - but had its holiday haunts sequel cancelled. instead we get the most generic  stereotyped script changes that is less original than what they had in the 80s as  the nth reboot that will just fail again. just go back to the original formula   its comfort food and fun. its the same reason we watch law   order or  white collar. fun detective show with likeable characters thatsolve mysteries. rinse  wash  and repeat for next episode. hopefully a character arc or story across a season but thats just a bonus. could be as simple as daph and freddy finally getting official or velma choosing to not go to college.  idk how old the original crew was in 80s but they always felt like college kids to me. who else has all that free time  and can afford a van  gas  and food to road trip every week.
I was a late bloomer myself and didn t really start puberty until I was 15 ish. I never had a baby phallus like its implied that boys have before puberty.  this is not a jab at you as a woman  but I cantell from the news of this bastardization of  scooby doo  that it was written by a fair left leaning woman. and given her background  I feel she was raised by a very male dominated culture where women dont have the freedoms given in the west.  she s at the very least first generation immigrant who became as easy target for the second-third wave feminism.
wait  is daphanI naked
so  the only way they would be okay with having a white guy in the cast was if they effectively neutered him and sissyfied him and yeah  if this show is supposed to be for adults then the scooby squad should have been appropriately aged.otherwise itskirts some seriously pedophilic boundaries.if the show on the other hand was for teens then there shouldn t be gratuitous nudity like what they have with daphne there.unless the premise of the show is to deal with teenage woes specifically and it does so in a constructive  educational  pedagogic and supportive manner.but that was never what scooby doo was about. and making it about that would destroy much of what made scooby doo  well  scooby doo.and if they re somehow trying to make this into some kind of rick   morty schtick... just give up. the creators of r m did their thing better than just about anyone can do. no one is ever going to tap into that juice but them.its like trying to recreate south park. you just cant do it without the original creators involved. it ll fall flat on its face.come up with something new instead of hijacking another franchise that was never supposed to be like that.I wonder why the entertainment industry of today is so flooded with talentless  uninspired hacks and zealot woke feminist cultists there s got to be someone sane left  right
they ll sexualize Godzilla next.
of course they re ruining fred. who didnt see that coming  they didnt leave one straight white guy in their woke reboot to not dump on him constantly.
its become very obvious that these shows serve no purpose but to take something well loved in the culture  corrupt it with utterly warped and depraved ideologies and then weaponize it to attack the people they perceive as their enemies. it is very disheartening to see a beloved kids cartoon perverted and used this way and I think that is exactly their goal. they seek to demoralize and harm the people that dont believe in their extreme doctrine.
the reason they insult men about there love life is cus it works men are very sensitive about those things
I dont understand what s emasculating about this.its bad. yes. its annoying. yes. its a slap in the face to fans of the old gang and fred s character as a whole. yes. but how is this emasculating
we not talking about black shaggy
literally making fun of his  is about as emasculating as it gets
so they give fred 2 very good reasons to act out in the form of an abusive    dad and stunted growth  but they still feel the need to dunk on him like his  what they view as  your average privileged white guy
another great franchise turned into an awful self-insert fanfic.
this is practically   tell me you didn t read or watch the original source without telling you didn t do that.   but  100 worse
Im sorry  but kids who grew up with the show dont want an adult version of the show where the kids are naked woke teens. I love watching my sons watch the old scooby doo show and pretty much everything up to be cool scooby doo  that I am aware of . if youre going to do an adult scooby doo  it needs to be the characters grown up and doing some major x-files type stuff or hunting monsters van helsing style and dialing up the horror aspects to 10. there are so many things you could actually do with this property that would be 100x more appropriate and have long-time fans on board.
um... sooooo.... has anybody seen scoob
fred in the original always looked out for the others  the fact they made him some narcissistic white demon just shows that they should not be writing this show
ya know  Im someone who firmly believes you cant judge something you haven t seen. I do not believe people should talk shit about movies  tv shows  and other forms of entertainment when they haven t actually seen them because I believe its unfair to the show and the people who made it. but holy fuck I think this might be the exception because thatsounds like a terrible show and not in good faith of the original cartoons. this tweet is incredibly disgusting and if thats what they re doing then the show is guaranteed to be absolutely dogshit. oh and by the way delayed puberty is a real medical condition that millions of boys and girls suffer from and the fact that they re playing it like a joke makes me sick
big moist thought it was ridiculous. a few brain deds  maybe bots  in his chat went all r@ssist on him.
what makes me want to laugh is they made the hippie  somewhat pothead  a black dude  it would be hilarious if they cast snoop dog to voice him. they complain of stereotypes and then go full on racial stereotype. hypocrisy at its finest  that and the fact that there is no scooby...just disappointing.
the idea of scooby doo becoming an adult show made me think they would be actual adults.. not 16.. ew. thats the reason why I couldn t watch big mouth  so Im already mentally checked out of this now.
how obvious do you have to be to show everyone that you ve not only never seen the show  but also hate everything about it
much like the original fred. he s a white guy. thats it he s white thats the only resemblance fred was such a nice guy who helped people he was brave and courageous  and a genius being able to set elaborate traps and scenarios.
probably he just told them no ur not my type
the wildest thing is that in the old days  before these characters were being heavily sexualized by minority sexualities to make a point you could project any sexual identity onto these characters to relate to because that portion of their characterization was never there it was a blank slate because the cartoons weren t trying to indoctrinate children.   it was far more inclusive and accepting to leave sexuality out of these characters entirely and just have them default to being friends with synergistic personalities who like eachother and solve mysteries.
8 30 weak men are easier to conquer
as a single father I have not let my son watch anything that has been created post 2018  plus a great deal of content  pre 2018. nudity and swearing are now so commonplace its ridiculous  so I just say no.
16-17 year olds have sex  there s no problem with that  its neither healthy nor unhealthy  its normal  and so it is if they dont have sex  just to clarify . the problem lies with grown adults sexualizing teenagers and acting like they are building sexual tension for themselves with minors. this show is creeping me out
finally a cute youtuber
thats what I dont get  why do you want to know the pronouns of young adults and sub-10 year olds  without influence  most kids under 10 aren t worried about relationships let alone which sex gender they re attracted to  so why tf are adults wanting to know pronouns.
this show is basically going too be big mouf. the scooby-doo version. big-mouf was a nasty show. Im surprised it never got as much backlash as I thought itshould have back then. if only we knew then what we know now.
when I watched scooby doo as a kid  I always thought of fred as being the wise leader of the group. this show seems like its just more white male race hating or bashing from current day woke hollywood creators. from what I understand he is written as being the dumb one of the group to make a joke out of in this series.
how is it possible to pretend to be so enraged by a scooby doo cartoon
cheer yourself up with the m3gan trailer
I dont particularly enjoy talking about genitals or think about them in cartoons  but I figured that they d make them all have opposite that they d presumably have with how they present. make them all trans  in other words. you know  because 78  of the population is trans. I predict that in the future  this point in history will be known as  the era of over correction . when groups that historically haven t had equal rights actually achieve equal rights  or even more rights   what do they do  relax and enjoy having achieved equal rights  no  they have to keep fighting as if the goal hasn t been achieved. they have to invent boogeymen. pretend that they re still discriminated against. keep pressing forward gaining more and more power. everything isn t about power  but to them  it is.
yeah this is just disgusting there clearly is something sinister going on here !!!
what the f ck did they do to the series  last time I was a  casual  fan of scooby doo it was during the 90s when cartoon network did reruns and aired zombie island seemingly every weekend  cartoon theater  . after a little while I lost track because of no cable tv access. over the years a new movie would come out then in the past 15 apparently its a new take on the gang in various art styles and bad movies once every few years which only get to me via movie review channels. now there s this garbage. they re all teenagers now  again  why  the animation style leaves much to be desired and every character is unrecognizable.if Im sounding like an old fart then so be it. the show s supposed to be about five 20-30-something men and women with a dog randomly driving around solving mysteries  not insecure teenagers trying to deal with emotional baggage. random note here   its not personally  emasculating  to me... a straight 33-year-old ace... to be called virgin  which I am. it is however irksome to hear  incel  and  virgin  being thrown around like confetti. try  retard  or  jackass  instead. y know  actual insults. then again they re used so much they ve lost all meaning so come off as empty.
called it. as soon as I read that racist mindy say that fred was your standard white guy  I knew that was so they could make him a dude bro jerk that they would put all the evil  masculine  traits onto. the fact they got howerton to do the voice confirmed it in my head  he has a history of playing that crass jerk male. cant have a good strong male character anymore  white men need to be shown as impotent oppressors of women and minorities. I like how the misandrist mindy also managed somehow to get a trump reference in  she has so many problems I sort of feel sorry for her. so deranged.it is so disgusting how they try to gaslight everyone into believing that daphne was portrayed as some 2d vapid character just there for boys to lust after but then reduce fred to pretty much the same thing. also disgusting how literally every article in favour of this trash is talking about everyones sex life. a 15 year old girl is getting so sick of the  over the clothes  stuff  serious
velma is sad excuse for a scooby show.
my honest take is that new iterations of shows doesnt  ruin  the characters  its just a different interpretation. the old but gold classic versions will always still exist to look back on and enjoy.
you sound like velma
at least they think they are improving the other characters.  with fred they  of course  keep him white so they can deliberately make him a pathetic  worthless  terrible  character.  so the only character who is composed of nothing but flaws is the white guy  while everyone else is flawless.  yeah  no overt agenda to see here  folks!
interesting how they keep fred  the character  whom on the surface is the most selfish  dumb and vain of the whole group  the same.    but deep down loves his friends and shows feats of leadership and bravery  .  kind of like they need to further propagate the trend of hating on white people thats so widely accepted today. the needed a joke with a recognizably white face. thats just so sad. and this is coming from a pacific islander  from an island that has had their acenestal land stolen by the military. so yes  my people have some claim to harbor potential malcontent for whites and foreigners. but I have the integrity to call hypocrisy out when  I see it. people of color got their voice to be heard and then totally disgraced themselves by acting in the ways they claim oppressed them. do better and stop jumping at every chance to degrade white people and destroy their culture. do better and dont be like the people actually responsible for your hardships.
fred was never always taking credit w we by are they trying to make him a privileged white boy  not to mention fred never looked down on anyone.
gone are the days when cartoons were fun  now they must have an all inclusive message. this opens up a doorway for studios to complain about viewers and attack fans. keep your woke crap.
they cant help themselves.
good grief  thats just plain disrespectful and mean spirited. but then again  thats the woke crew for you  mindlessly hating on white people because they can. hating themselves and projecting it onto others around them  as usual. Im glad that the paradigm is changing and fans are speaking up more and more and shooting down the woke vanity projects. because this is all these series are  woke vanity projects destined to fail because they dont appeal to audiences in general  they only appeal to a very limited and tiny subset of very vocal sorts who dont represent the great majority of america.
the fact alone that mindy is involved makes me not want to watch it. I never found her funny or talented. she plays the same thing everytime herself. Ive never been a fan of scooby doo even as a kid the whole concept of running from ghosts and monsters who just end up people seems boring and lazy writing even for a cartoon. if anything I d be someone to give it a shot due to not being overly upset over change. not now mindy has decided to make this a passive aggressive woke propaganda machine. instead of taking time and making an adult well written update to a property that is loved. typical politically correct woke meaningless dog poo. netflix and hbo did this a ton look at the mess they are in now.
this feels like they took all of thier story cue s from the 2 live action movies with no regard for the classic cartoon that was written for kids
Im old enough to remember  that this is the second time half of these characters were made unlikeable for comedy s sake. remember a pup named scooby doo  daphne was a spoiled brat and fred was a halfwit.
uh  he wears and ascot  he s emasculating himself.
exactly  there s still gonna be a new children scooby doo movie every damn year.
@ta-shawn va  honestly tho. if you look up a list of how many scooby doo movies there are  the amount is absurd lol
the show is just giving me ew vibes  I had no intention to watch it and I have less intent to watch it now. honestly grown adults being some sicko s. Imiss courage the cowardly dog.  _ the fact you addressed the double standard indirectly made me feel better that others are seeing that bs line that is thrown out there.
cant wait to not watch it
woke go broke needs to happen quickly. it already has been 7 years of spoon fed cringe
harvey weinstein would be proud of these writers.
this is the world now smfh
look  I was never a fan of fred but even I think what they re doing to him is ridiculous. stop ruining our childhood
they cant help themselves.
sad to see all my beloved shows  movies  games  stuff from our childhood memories  etc. becoming complete garbage  have gone full woke a   trash. from these Goddamn awful companies and studios that are now shadow of their former selves.
scooby doo in the future  scooby is dead and the gang are all in a polyamirus relationship.  just incase hbo max sees this as a good idea  this is a joke!
why cant we have good movies anymore  that actually focuses on the story and stuff rather than oh  man bad   gay is your only character trait etc
to think I was actually gonna watch this crap Im even more afraid of what they ve done with shaggy.
hbo and cartoons dont mix hbo doesnt know anything about cartoons at all or the scooby doo characters and Im glad they didn t add scooby in the velma spin off it would just piss me off even more cause I know hbo would find away to ruin him to
I cant even watch this without laughing  not happy laughs. sad laughs
fred is gonna be transgender  Im calling it now
wasn t the live action scooby doo like that at first as well but yeah they are ruining the franchise but I also read hbo max is no longer putting in animation shows anymore
I just hope that fred and velma can actually get together and be a couple other than daphne and fred they just seem to be better off together shaggy seems to be better off with daphne then velma or hell have daphne x velma together and shaggy x fred together
fkng hel! I love your hair!!! sry for the high caps  but damn!
what next saggy and scooby
hbo max  this is a show for  adults!also them  sexualises actual minorsanyways  I know Im not even going to unironically watch this.
they made shaggy black
I know. let s make fat albert white and skinny. yeah! I like that.
Jesus yeah they are perverts but easily overshadowing their perverted behavior is a lack of social skills and insecurities.
so basically a new cartoon version of riverdale! but even worse! and thats saying something
look no further than these people s inability to create a series of coherent sentences to see the level of writing we re dealing with here.
100
so damn is a swearword but crap isn t lmao ok
why cant scoobie do  ust be scoobie do
Im more surprised they didn t make him gay with his own pronouns.
fred is an effin cinnamon roll dafuq are they on about  velma is the majority be the one who initiate describing the crime scene in the group when the culprit got caught  despite difference in size daphne is stonget than fred in self defense  scooby and shaggy is the heart and soul . make your own damn character haliwood
hbo might as well stand for human body odor  cause everything they do reeks
man what  he hasn t gone through puberty   of all the weird shit to make be part of a characters story.
everything dies we should be looking for new stuff as well
this is making raja gosnell look good!
what the literal fuuuuuuuuu...... are they doing   fred is a wholesome jock. now they want him to be a ladyboy.
wow not even scoobie doo is safe from the woke mob.
every character of the old scooby gang was fine they dident need change in my opinion its a kid show meaning it doesnt need political vieuws cartoons for kids should be about friendship and the adventures
... why. why do they keep doing filth. the filth that you can literally pee on to extinguish  wash away and forget about.
scooby dont.
never heard of a 16 yr old that hasn t hit puberty. either way why would it even be a thought even worse a plot
called it lol
since hbo doesnt know squat about cartoons thats a perfect idea for them xd
I do not really fancy the velma spin-off  since scooby-doo does not suit being toned up for adults  and that promotional image looks gruesome!  also  what the heck ! fred is some childish teenager who is full of himself  daphne is a sex model  and velma is the least popular student in school ! thats all messed up! they were never like that in many shows  including the very first one! and I would rather put fred with daphne than velma in love with him. yes  as you say  dating doesnt need to be covered in shows for children  and I know I dont recall any romantic relationships between the main characters in the original shows  but I think it works well for fred and daphne in recent shows.  also  thatsure does ruin velma s sexuality  though I have fancied her as a waifu  so in regards to her having been a lesbian  but now fancying fred  I think I would work with her being bisexual. either way  I would not ship her with fred  and she is indeed supposed to be the smart girl of the group.so again  I honestly do not look forward to velma  the spin-off. if anyone at warner bros is gonna change scooby-doo  for the bad... then I do not look forward to all that comes in the future. heck  we already lost the Christmas special for the cgI film.  so I d rather just stick to the original shows  what s new  scooby-doo   scooby-doo  mystery incorporated  many of the direct-to-video films  and scoob!.
velma is going to bomb. going to get cancelled so fast.
and shaggy is not black damn it!
thanks!
damn is a swear word ! !
shouldn t have used scooby-doo  should ve made a different show
Imean Im teen which of course means that Im very much fond of girls and I like seeing pretty girls it make happy somehow I dont why  but this doesnt mean like this crap. Imean seriously these people are disgusting pervert not even a slight but of forgiveness they will get from God... I have watched dollar trilogy  and mate clint eastwood does inspire me to be like him in movie one. and these people are making kids stupid  and telling something which shouldn t be told until they re old enough to handle this world.
who thought thatscooby doo should have a antiwhite and misandrist version
not. every. story. needs. romance. subplots.
why cant the show come out first and then people hate on it. its not even out yet and its  the worst scooby doo show ever  it could be good or bad but the thing has to come out first.
so... no dog  race-swapped characters  fred gets this treatment...hell.
fresh wasn t like that
daaamn what the heck  their fred sounds nothing like the original fred. this sounds fake  surely this isn t real
speaking of  story telling for children  what s going on with cartoons now!  are jokes outlawed or what the hell!  I heard about this shit called  infinity train  with genocide and gross brain parasite of  what if there is no home  and I ll never see my family or friends again   I used to rush home after school to catch billy and mandy  camp lazlo  or those older avenger cartoons. maybe streaming services are changing rules for  pg-13  pg  tv-ma
yep  I for one will not be contributing to the ratings of velma. everything about it is just wrong and an attack on fans and the source material.
ohh fred is 16 and hasn t gone thru puberty  Im calling it! his big secret is that he s transgendered!
shame on them for sexulising them
what was wrong with modern himbo fred  just give us back mystery incorporated dumb but lovable fred...
Im convinced the hack writers of this garbage are projecting their own insecurities and issues onto the characters.
anyone else really anyone s by the fact that they changed it from coolsville to poortown        or just me
thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  very welcome and keep up the good fight!
fred was already dull enough. why did they want to make him insufferable
I just hate this whole new woke society agenda. I want to go back in time and just stay there when everything was simple. give me back my original scooby-doo and the gang. they were perfect.
where s scooby you can do this to scooby
2 50 hasnt... how are they going to make him sexist if he hasnt gone through puberty  also how does he get that physique without the increased testosterone  also its going to be impossible to make his voice sound like someone who hasnt gone through puberty. oh gosh are they gonna make fred trans
he is good leader not bad leader
Im excited to see people being triggered by everything lol.
you just know they never seen even 1 epsiode of scooby doo if they decided fred was the  obviously the jock white guy that is a total jerk  cause are you kidding me  fred  fred jones   the man babies his    van  is optimistic as all hell  loves his friends to bits  is a social butterfly and ready to jump into action to help some random person out with their ghost problem    my man can be an airheaded big guy but he is always there to help you out and the hell they mean  takes all the credit !  ! he always points out when the team did something important and to give them credit   and daphne found the remote   we wouldnt have done is if shaggy and scooby werent there to find that clue  etc etc  and mostly letting velma give her sherlock holmes explenation  also  can anyone tell me who is the one to comes up with a plan to capture the villain and who makes all the complecated traps again    oh right thats freddie. velma is smart no doubt but fried is an incredible engineer and organizer to her detective work  he may not know who was the guy behind the mask but he did trap the guy with just a net a screw and 3 wooden planks somehow and sometimes his plans didnt work out as intended! he fails a few times but always goes right back into solving the problem! he deserves to be treated with respect!  also  I can buy him being a jock but Im 100  sure he was with the teather kids with the backstage crew  I dare you to look me in the eyes and say fred jones wouldn t be a backstage technician
triste
let s split up....
welp  this is what happens when the new generations come and millenials start taking over script writingwait till the zoomers start doing it too. then it will be even worse chaos
good thing I cancel my hbo max account
as you say  we dont know where this description came from. I will wait to see if this is real  cuz for me it looks like is fake to make the show looks bad or worse.people didnt like the new velma and shaggy  and I didnt like it too  and now looks to me people are making it look worse.if this description is trie  it is really bad. ita dumb and makes no sense. lets wait and see.and about velma being gay and now she has a crush in fred  I think she is bI  cuz we all know she had a thing with shaggy already in mistery inc. so yeah  bImay be the right path for her.
these ppl who are doing all these changes now better watch out for the generation behind them. cause  kharma will come back and bite then in the ass..
as a white male  I just wanted to say that I did a great job on this video.  youre all welcome.
being someone whose friends were boys  this comes off as misandristic.
why do they keep doin this ish woman kingdont worry darlingshe-hulkrings of powernow scooby-doo.make itstop.
huh what a weird copy of the famous scooby doo franchise that is definitely not a spinoff or an actual part of the scooby doo franchise
how do you distact a population from inflation  war  genocide  an incoming famine  corporate greed. this is how.
I dont want them to add scooby in the spin off hbo would just find away to ruin the poor dog  -
next time age them up and no race swap
are they tryna make fred racist !
me too.
we should boycott this show so that its debut has no audience score. that ll get the studio s attention.
fred should have been race swapped and a competent leader. shaggy should ve stayed shaggy.
allllllll the crap politics and ideology aside  the article is atrociously written. Im a news writer and editor  and that article gave me an aneurysm. good gracious  it either didn t get edited  the editor didn t attend grammar school  or they were drunk. I briefly wrote for the gww. thank goodness I jumped ship years ago.
hbo is making the same mistake that d!zn3y did.
damn even hbo is pushing this bs  disappointing.
oh my God dude  this show hasn t even come up and its already making people mad including myself. Im so sick of hollywood always shoving this woke shit down are throat  like can we just have a fun cartoon that doesnt this be the main focus of the humor at least when rick   morty does it  the just make it into a funny bit not try to making feel like its the main part of the humor.
if there 18 its magically ok. totally makes since  also 16 is the legal age of consent in most states ur argument holds no value
the og fred was a born leader he could lead an army this mindy fred he wouldn t get my vote for leadership
why does mindy kaling pretends to be woke but years ago was writer actress in the office  a show with jokes like  try my cookie cookie  and dwight spraying a woman with bug spray or steve carrell running over a woman with his car.why wasn t she woke then
hold on this show sounds almost like child porn. underage being sexualized.   fred didn t take credit from others.
isn t that the point the teaser  to ruin the characters
wholesome  fun  cartoons is gone and replaced with trash!
why couldn t they just leave scooby doo as is  why did they have to make unnecessary changes no one asked for nor wanted..
this level of disrespect pisses me off. this is unacceptable. I dont have peaceful words for this.
imagine being such a Godawful writer you cant even get a classic cartoon character right.
so mindy kaling made shaggy black huh    a stoner drug dealer   way to go mindy !
why everything today needs to revolve arround sex  wtf
scooby doo was the original breakfast club... there was nothing wrong with their dynamic. these writers just made some shit up to fit their narrative and honestly it isn t even original anymore
I remember 2016 or 2019 I cant remember years. fred s mayor  father criminal  . mayor  son not father  where is real fred parents   they designed messed up mixed ruined
fred was a gigachad shame on them for ruing him.
it does! isn t she like 15 or 16 in this show that is aimed at an  adult  audience
why even do the show if all they are going to do is hate on the characters ......... this describes your entire job ... man alive you need some self respect   bad
as a black guy the social politicing is crazy because now its getting out of hand scooby doo never needed the change alot of properties are changing the race sexual orientation and its kinda upsetting I cant enjoy these characters I remembered as a child
this sounds like some fetishy  role play shit the writers are doing with their child characters  its always the people who preach the loudest that are   like this  if you you know what Imean
just boycott and dont hate watch. let them fail thats the only way these people will learn.
why is hbo fucking over the scooby gang
afortunadamente xd ....
let hbo max. do what they wantits not like we will watch its not canon
sure as fuck not my mystery gang
you know double standards of being racist  now they are being racist to fred... fred dammit!
definitely a perversion of the show. I thought this new hbo boss was going to nock this garbage.
I saw house of dragons and stopped watching after 3 episiodes.hollywood is litteraly perverted even saying this as a  man .they should change to the porn industry or something and stop with this cringe bs.it ruins the day not only that but also the woke stuff or like in each story someone was mishandled by their parents etc.. I litteraly believe that those guys writing the scripts are litteraly mental.
its infuriating how they have destroyed every beloved character by stripping them of their good qualities   replaced with woke propaganda.  its simply disgusting how everything has to be about sex.  its like sodom   gomorrah 2.0 by the woke movement.  where are they getting all these directors charged with re-creating children s shows   from the porn industry
fortunately  fred is wrongly imprisoned for murder he didn t commit. seriously   fortunately   what is so awesome in being arrested and imprisoned for crime we not commit
wat!
I like your message and all but good Lord you said  emasculate  like 20 times
Imean its hbo scooby doo there doing things there way  its not like its real its a cartoon for adults and the characters always looked much older. velma and daphne look nothing like kids. you think this is crazy check out robot chicken
woah woah woah !  I cant believe they did that this straight up gross  what the hell was screw the actress that portray velma and screw every person who is involved in this I hate hbo max screw that tyrant website .
yeah tv sucks now
ooh  sad  hot lady back. I watch video.
time for a crusade
I think the creators are pathetic  simple as
scooby doo needs to end it has been on since 1969.
these people ever actually watch the shows they criticize and prevert for their own whims
goofy ass writers
are they really making fred trans
bruh.ignoring the race-swapping and wokeism.why tf would anyone be on board with a scooby doo series without scooby doo the dog was what tied everything together and the main reason why people loved the cartoon series for so long.
I do my best not to support hbo max at all.
I agree that they re destroying this show  and its bad. age them up  how old are the fictional characters again  I ll ask again. when was the art born from their parents  its not something I agree on  but art is art. we dont censor art in this country. there is no victim  they re drawings. I ll ask you again  how old are the drawings again I dont want to start a slippery slope of censorship. that is all.
they going to give fred gender dysphoria and turn him into a transgender.
cartoons are for kids. at least these are.
how they ruined frank welkers character
because all art that might inspire thought crime must be demeaned and replaced  comrade.
ever heard of a hairbrush
why the hell would you make a kids show for adults. or turn a kids show into an adult show
in america  you have the freedom to not watch. I dont know about mexico   canada. its weird that people need to complain about something they re not gonna watch.
I think millenials should stop writing about it and start doing it. this why tv was better in 70 s and 80 s
3 down  1 to go. I bet shaggy s a furry and his fursona is  scooby doo  because why the fuck not
and a ton more I read in the comments
soooo...-velma  once a genius  is now a moronic toxic internet fan...-daphne  strong willed sweetheart  is a wannabee queenb tch...-fred  himbo extraordinaire  is a teenager babyboy crybaby...-scooby does not exist...the bets are open  how are they gonna destroy sha-oh  sorry-norville listen  if you want to self-insert so badly  why dont you make your own tv series instead of ruining what people already love
this and the new movie to scooby doo is the sequel trilogy to star wars.its so terrible that most of the fanbase joins together and decides we d rather have anything the fuck else we used to dislike then deal with this new garbage
Ive always thought cartoons is for all ages cause Im 32 and I still love cartoons to this day but what hbo is doing is such an embarrassment
these people are so weird
old school sexualized women were made by and for men that liked them  today s  sexualized  women are just...wrong!
overwatch was ruined  scooby doo is going to be ruined... just  a sad year to media I liked
why does  white  have a     is it a swear word to these people  they are insane. clinically. insane. these people need therapy and a closed padded room with two or three square meals a day. and maybe a hug but volunteers only for that bit.
I dont care. I am not gonna watch it and I believe only small group of specific people will watch it. our childhood is safe because its in the past and our children still can watch golden era of cartoons
I knew fred was going to be dragged into the mud  and turned into a horrible character. he s white  straight  and a man  what did you expect  also  this show sounds like just a fanfic  and alot of projection.
he doesnt even talk about the trasure  0 10 disappointment
well well well... they claim  ethnic diverse cast  and yet end up going pretty damn racist. who s shocked
why in the hell are they even using the scooby doo characters for this show  legit looks like it has absolutely nothing to do with them besides the characters just being there  they could ve just made up some characters if they wanted to make them look like the voice actors  now we have an indian velma  a black shaggy  an asian daphne  an emasculated fred and probably a cat replacing scooby because at this point why the hell not. just call this show mindy and remove all references to the scooby doo characters.
men bad. got it.
these are not real people.
wtf is going on with entertainment today  its like everyone making shows today has serious mental illness.....
h-bdsm is a more apt name for the network. what else can you expect from hollyweird.
wb effing up hanna barberaclassics as they go.they already made velma gay andblack.now going after fred an the rest ofthem.
what the f ck am I listening to
hold on. I was with you until you started saying thatsex was unhealthy. maybe you are a bit too tightly wound either way this show looks like it is bastardizing the ip  and I cant wait to watch the trainwreck when it comes out.
oh and the eternals.race gender swapped all the characters except the hwyte guy...and made him the villain.really
yeah... us millennials ruin everything we touch. those early 80 s millennials are okay  but us late 80s and 90s millennials...
oh I see now. this is just one of those negative nancy channels.
in the uk the bbc wanted to make a new series of the wombles I dont know if you know the wombles but they were a great cartoon but they wanted to make a new series so they asked elizabeth beresford who is the creator of the wombles to write new stories for a television series but they wanted madame chalet out of the kitchen she point blankly refused and told the bbc that madame chalet was in the kitchen and thats where she will stay and if you dont like it you cant use my stories. and what does this Bible say about the end of time aren t we going through that right now. oh and one other thing they better keep their hands off the roadrunner show I am in my 50s and I still love it the way it is it always gives me a big smile on my face even at my age.
why are these people so obsessed with sex! its so weird  this is a story of a bunch of kids that go around solving silly mysteries  why do they have to come and pervert everything by making sex the focus.
based on the title of your video  I thought hbo was turning fred into a cross-dresser. oops! Imean  transexual.
truly disgusted at this sex sells form of business model for tv ugghhhh
this is so sick...its so perverted and twisted and disgusting
let s all not forget  the fact scooby doo has been removed as the muslims find the dog offensive.
the best thing we can do to combat this garbage is to boycott it completely.  just dont watch it.
you mean the people who cut the namesake of the show out  changed the race of three out of the four characters  and made one a lesbian took lazy pot shots at a white male character in the year 2022  Im shocked  shocked! well not thatshocked.
I hope david zaslav likes losing subscribers because Im ready to get  cancelhbomax trending
this show is going to be cancelled after the first episode then again with all the negative publicity they are getting people might watch to see the complete bullshit.
so what. they aren t the same characters.
sigh
dont watch. dont even hate watch
yeah the more I hear about this show the more I really dont like it!!!
what is this this is not scobby doowe gotta remove mask of these characters
its a freakin cartoon. a saturday morning cartoon...what is wrong with these writers. Im guessing these weirdos were bullied or unpopular or both and now they are taking their revenge on a cartoon character... once a loser always a loser. just pathetic and weird !
I hate everything
mindy kaling its in no talent hack you cant create her own content. I dont care who says what velma and shaggy are not black these people need to come up with their own content
hbo
these are fictional characters from a tv show that wasn t good to begin with. I just think its hilarious they turned the lazy  stoner  coward into a black guy
amen. dont even hate-watch it. hate views are still views.
@isabelle w  my thoughts exactly.  Im happy watching the original.
cause hbo hates cartoons they didn t do their homework on the scooby doo characters
just another no support of show   not sure anything hbo has done lately is worth bother to turn on.
who the fuck wants an adult scooby show  spot on video. this bs has to stop
hbo max s next bold move   live action smurf in the city  featuring polyamorous non-binary partner swaps  drug abuse and overdose  gang violence  sex trafficking  and suicide  for america s favorite innocent children s characters.
and this is important how
emasculating isn t real
Im starting to think this woke crap is about money laundering.
fred is my personal favorite scooby doo member and this irritated me. this is nothing like fred in the slightest. wtf is this crap
Im sorry... is nobody going to ask wtf does this have to do with  eric trump   speaking of daddy issues... hunter on the other hand...
what is is dad trump... he better not be I swear to God
wow... they want a white man villain so bad.change velma  but keep fred white and purposely make him uncharacteristically a typical jerk... what s with this crap even if he s ever been close to being a jock stereotype at most  they re really  really reaching the make a white guy look bad.. for the plot..  why
ew. ew ew.  ewwwww.  eewwwwwwwwwww.I feel like this sufficient.
what about the stereotypical sexual objectification of asian women with what they did with daphne
also  they will use an asian woman  who hates being asian  to voice act as dalphne. isn t that cultural appropriation  why didn t they also change her to be asian too
as far as Im concerned this new woke garbage doesnt even exist  and I ll never watch it. I want entertaining  well-written shows that focus on good stories instead of the physical characteristics of the characters and who they re sleeping with. obviously  this wasn t made for me.
daphne is still hotter than velma. the question is  is scrappy doo trans
just ruin all the childhood characters. not my velma  daphne  fred or shaggy. and no scooby. please create an original character.
yeah why is sexuality and race always talking points in like all entertainment now
on one hand the new show kind of sucksbut on the other I feel the outrage is pretty lame since who cares about the sanctity of scooby fucking doo and the characterization of fred
the writers are just projecting their baggage  bitterness and perversions on an old cartoon show. same formula you always see pick a show use it as a theme and here comes the crap! they re not even original in their unoriginality.
all part of the socialist humiliation ritual
they did race swap daphne asian  Imade a video about that too
thanks to all their woke joke b      changes... I doubt the scooby-doo franchise will last much longer.compared to the reputation it once had.much like disney in general and all the poisonous b      their putting out. scooby-doo needs to get back to entertaining the people and keeping that preaching b      to themselves.or another idea just make your own woke joke shows and leave the classics the f    alone
just dont watch it.
why shame  late bloomers    not punching low enough with the whole  incel  thing   these are people with real problems  so compassion might be better than ridicule.
I hate all of these  modern reimagining  of classic ips. just make an original story
Im getting so sick of all these stupid cartoons dedicated to so called adults. all it is  is a sign that in today s world we dont actually have adults . .we have children whose bodies outgrew their mentality.
the article writer has atrocious grammar.
ugh
since the original  and best  series started in 1969  most its fans are gen x ers.  good luck selling that woke crap to us.
who wrote this article  their sentence structure is all over the place  and this person has no understanding of what a comma is and how itshould be used. this article is a pain to read. even a high school graduate should be able to structure sentences better than this. holy hell. I have a buddy who is an english major  and if I showed him this article  his head would explode. this shows me that the right of this article is not very intelligent at all. not only in what they are writing  but how they are writing it. God this was painful in just about every way....Jesus....
we dont to recreate og original storys to make a certain culture happy what if larry bird was the main guy in space jam or we made micheal jordan a white guy people def wouldnt be happy
man the trumps havent been in power for 2  years now  and the family is still living rent free in peoples minds.... good Lord  this whole show seems sick easy pass for me great coverage tho
im white and I dont like this
the writing in the picture you showed literally looks aI generated. its like someone typed  angry leftist pedo show  into a generator and this was what the machine shit out. not even pro-trump at all but the eric trump joke was cringe as hell. its like they had to put that in there. I hate it here.
this new one is going to suck . not worth watching.
this show is horrible. velma isn t bad and neither is daphne. their character designs are bad but not horrible but they re ruining their characters
Im sorry but you cant delete my comments just because the truth hurts. anime does this all the time  using fan service to bait guys into watching and no one seems to care. infact its celebrated.
this . this is a cartoon. aren t you 35
this garbage makes scrappy look good.
why not just make your own show.. why bash on classics
as a multiracial individual  I find this entire remake somewhat racist.
it was a freaking cartoon  it had no real value.
kid....
okay this racism is just getting disgusting. first you racewash the majority of the cast  but then make the only one  defined by their whiteness  a literal pre-pubescent guy who takes all the credit from others with major daddy issues  are you serious  wtaf.
how is this for children    fred is imprisoned for murder he didn t commit    are they turning scooby doo into riverdale except much much worse    why cant they just make a normal mystery kids story or leave it well alone and create yours because majority of the fans wont accept this really bad hater fiction because this isn t even fanfiction as cannon and it ll fail extraordinarily and it ll just fall into the trash of once loved ips that have been destroyed by hollywood as hollywood find some other beloved ip to play with and destroy... destroying people s lives work just because they want validation and are addicted to itso bad that they re dying to get it from fictional characters that they re in control of because they cant get it from real life people they like sincerely or at all...
I dont it either.      its another unnecessary change to the original.  she s right  and passionate.   write b.s. stories with your own original material. how stupid
nah you lot are bringing up race and gender in scooby doo now and you still act like you dont know why your father never returned with the milk
this velma cartoon is aweful.
wow amazing they have managed to ruin something else from my childhood. but hey the wizard of oz  a classic they destroyed. the wiz  lol I guess its time curie make fat albert they could use the morbidly obese white guy in the movie seven starring... freeman pitt movie.
why does every white make character have day issues  Im over it hollywood move on
so ridiculous  and racist.
thats rasict to me as german american. I love scooby-doo but this show will be rasict to everyone.
trump is really living rent free in their heads huh  I wont even bother with this show  everything Ive seen so far is terrible.
I have no interest in this kaka.
Imean I think y all need to realize that the point of the series is parody. its poking fun at a beloved characters its part of the joke
these people need to be stop not scooby-doo I grew up this show this bad make your own mystery incorporated show stop remaking something that was good now trash
thats why I will never watch that peter crap bulshit.
I will not be watching f that
typical current-brand feminist rhetoric  fetishizing fictional themes  and misandry.
why are grown up so upset about a kids show
are y all serious y all really tweaking over a fucking cartoon character being quote on quote masculine bruh y all need God
@saI I know right  hbo wasn t thinking at all when they made this show
its not a kids show  its supposed to be a comedy adult version which is why I dont understand how people are taking it all so seriously
