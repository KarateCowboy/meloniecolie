did he just call himself a bad actor on accident  its not a good thing to admit that you wouldn t get hired if it weren t for diverse hiring practices. does he even feel like he earned it
tarentino can write a great script with a 5 million dollar budget look way better than any other mcu movie
let s give a big clap clap  for the first asian actor in history. so stunning and brave
honestly I d take a tarantino movie over a marvel movie any day!  tarantino is a master of dialogue.
simu is that one kid who would take his ball and go home once he started losing
lmao I love how the title gets straight to the point  . also  him calling tarintino racist  honestly ..... sigh
simu liu doesnt realize that bruce lee changed hollywood s action films into a faster pace.  before bruce lee  john wayne s cowboy films were as fast as it got.  plus  john woo changed hollywood s gun shooting scenes into a much faster pace too  such as face off with nicolas cage and john travolta.
am I the only one that keeps forgetting thatsimu liu is still a thing
have you seen  battle royale  quentin tarantino was friends with the director of that film  kinjI fukasaku  before he passed away.  he cast one of the girls from that film  chiakI kuriyama  as gogo yubarI in kill bill.battle royale is a great movie  one of my favorites of all time.  if you haven t seen it definitely give it a shot.
I legit had to google who the fuck simu liu is. I feel like thatsays it all.
I actually own both hong kong version and tarantino s produced and distributed version of iron monkey. you cantell he loves the genre. he revamped the sound effects for the movie which greatly increased the impact of the fight scenes. highly recommend that movie.
always makes me smile to see a new video from melonie! have a wonderful thanksgiving with your family  melonie.
melonie pronouncing names is one of my favorite things.
my first comic book was a captain america comic from 1990  I have been a big fan of marvel ever since  even cried when stan lee passed. what disney is doing to marvel is absolutely unforgivable! marvel delved into issues of the time. disney doesnt need to bastardize our favorite characters to scale these stories for the modern times. they should just hire writers and directors who actually give a shit about these ip!
Im not saying that all asians look alike  Im asian too btw  but liu can easily be replaced for his role and no one s gonna notice  or complain.
to be fair  simu liu was getting a lot of acclaim for starring in kim s convenience  canadian tv show    he legit made a cool choreographed fight scene with a stunt team as an audition tape for consideration to be cast as shang-chi...  the movie was actually very good  imo.
I would watch daniel lu  andrew kojI  daniel dae kim  byron mann  benedict wong  rick yune  and the entire cast of marco polo in leading roles before I d spend money seeing simu liu in a film.
tarentino is the hideo kojima of movies so thats projection on their part
Ive been mispronouncing scorsese for like 30 years.
melonie  talking about a topicmelonie s brain  bring up lara croft.melonie  why melonie s brain  you gotta.
shots fired
he knows he s a diversity hire. he s basically saying he wouldn t have been hired based on merit like during tarantino golden days
by accident  sorry. just in case you wanna know and dont.
and he is a fake martial artist
@r jean gadbois  yea my krav maga cantake his fake kung fu fr
simu liu is an average looking guy and an ok actor. why cast him as shang chI   there are plenty of better looking chinese actors . I am chinese and I thought shang chI was ok and liu was ok in it.  if there was a sequel to shang chI and liu was replaced by another I couldn t care less.
he doesnt feel the need to earn things when he can be handed everything because of his skin color. he feels he s entitled to everything and doesnt have to work for it.
hell even for 100k he can make something better than mcu
he already did that  and even for way less. just 1.2 mio dollars. resevoir dogs
his kill bill vol.1   2 alone is far better movie than mcu
reservoir dogs only cost  1 200 000!
he did. he made an asian django that was amazing
@lit legend  he helped and had a roll in sukiyakI django. thatshit was wild.
try  1m tarantino does not care about how much he get payed. when hI is on to something new project he put his heart and soul into project. he is passion in what he do.
m-she-u sucks. every tarantino movie is better than the current marvel garbage movies.
slow clap  sarcastically.
chirp I hear crickets
1st asian lead actor in a superhero movie  yes that is a huge accomplishment. asian americans canadians are people too  we have money to spend  and we want to see more asian lead actors positive representation in hollywood.
melanie is asian  I think she deserves applause with or without asian privilege.
@delta blueprint  how is being in passable super hero moveI any better than any of jackie chan and bruce lee movie  as an asian I dont need holywood to represent me for money.
who knows  maybe china will be a new player in the movie industry
@mrbiggles53  I thought she was hawaiian or something
@spider salticidae  to me  he looks like a younger version of china s president xi. cant unsee. seriouslyhonestly  I thought the younger actor who portrayed the teenage shang chI had a better x factor and was better in the movieand of course simu liu who prior to this movie nobody knew  as we figure d had to get triggered and make it  all about me  with his lame virtue signaling rants on fake diversitybars
no  there are talented actors of every race  ethnicity  religion  sexual orientation  etc. it is a fact that the vast majority of casting calls for lead actors in movies and tv shows are race specific. if the director specifically asks for a white male or  white passing  male actor  then that means all actors of color are excluded from that role.  blind casting  that allows every color of actor to try out is not yet a thing in hollywood  and quentin tarantino and scorsese definitely have a bias towards limiting their auditions for lead roles to only white actors  and occasionally black actors .
sadly in hollywood aka dumpster wood today you can fail up words calamity kennedy who destroyed star wars and she still has a job but should have been fired and simu liu played himself
@spider salticidae  the directors made sure to cast an english speaking chinese-american or chinese-canadian actor  because that is an important part of the shang chI character s identity. there are plenty of average looking white and black actors in hollywood  jonah hill  jack black  will farrell  john c. reilly  willem defoe  kevin hart  all very successful actors  and nobody seems to care that they dont look like male models. why is it that an asian actor has to fit into some rigid asian standard of beauty
@spider salticidae  right  Im gay and asian and I love my asian men but simu liu is ugly  in my opinion.
@delta blueprint  simu liu plays a much better looking character than him and those men you mentioned are way better actors than him.
@c j  to be fair he is not a diversity hire. the character in the comics is asian so I wouldn t say its a diversity hire.
@mrbiggles53  melanie is asian-adjacent.
lol everything is always the first these days I noticed that. they try so hard to pretend like movies weren t absolutely diverse in the 80 s and 90 s and even into the 2000 s
cuz jackie chan  donnie yen  jet lI didny exist.
jackie chang  am I a joke for you
@trigger fairy  nobody said it was better than any jackie chan or bruce lee movie  and simu liu did not say anything at all like that. but being the star of a big budget hollywood superhero is a major achievement. the key word here is hollywood. all of jackie chan and  bruce lee s greatest movies were hong kong movie productions  where there was no racial discrimination against them. they  worked with asian directors  producers  etc. who hire and promote asian actors as a 1st choice. thats totally different from hollywood usa  where they are used to hiring white actors for every major role by default  unless otherwise specified in the script  and usually the roles given to asian actors are stereotypical like a nerd  ninja henchman  geisha  prostitute  mail-order bride  etc. as an asian-american  I    support more positive asian representation.
jennifer lawrence
@delta blueprint  Im indian and I dont need to see representation in hollywood. this diversity stuff is getting out of hand
yeah  the only good director marvel has had was sam raimI  and he couldn t even make a good movie. edgar write was smart to drop out of antman. james gunn is ehhhh.
funny  I thought a lot of subscribers of this channel were m-she-u simps according to the comment section of her  namor was ruined  video
@geeebuttersnap  what about jon favreau  he is definitely a good director. iron man 2 was only disappointing and underwhelming cause of ike perlmutter and marvel entertainment interfering.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  mind if you explain that debacle
@philI the gamer  because it was supposed to adapt the demon in a bottle comic book storyline  which jon favreau wanted   but ended up getting sidelined or scrapped by marvel. the skydive scene originally featured tony vomiting in the toilet inside his private jet from drinking too much but it ended up getting cut to make the sequel more family-oriented. ike perlmutter made terrence howard walk out on marvel cause they reduced his payment for the sequels so it can go to robert downey jr. s earnings and he recast his role with the inferior casting of don cheadle which screwed up continuity especially knowing they really do not look alike. jon favreau wanted the story to be great and wanted it to live up to the first iron man film and maybe even surpass it  but marvel was too focused on setting up future installments by shoehorning in the black widow and s.h.i.e.l.d. in the movie which so heavily detracted the story to the point where the movie seemed like it was more of a commercial for the avengers  which it did not even directly lead into  than a movie with its own creative freedom of quality storytelling. war machine lacked screentime.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  no surprise modern day marvel did this.
simu is the kind of person who would sign an autograph picture of himself and then give it to himself
simu liu is that one kid who brags about memorizing his favorite power rangers episode  word for word.  that also not a joke  he had openly admitted to this
that kid always pissed me off.
does he say   screw you guys  first
simu the type to be a lead actor in the biggest movie studio in history  am I right
@young dr. seuss  no. stop being that kid that takes his ball and goes home once you start losing
@young dr. seuss  yeah definitely  he s the type of person to think he s special because marvel gave him a chance.
so basically all of phase 4 s audience
working for disney was simu liu s 1st mistake 2nd mistake is pull this crap
he s pissed because janet is the better loved child.
@gammakap  thatsounds like a him problem
thats why he got ratioed in his own tweet. the guy doesnt know he was so diverse in his casting more than marvel lol
yeah that was a foolish statement for sure. obvious virtue signal was obvious
and the irony thatsimu liu made a racist comment in his dumb tweets lol
simu pulling the racist is pretty pathetic. if has done his homework or even seen one of tarantino s masters piece. you would know thats far from the truth.
yeah  and quentin tarantino totally disrespected bruce lee and his accomplishments by unilaterally rewriting his history and then publicly insulting and slandering his surviving family members.
@delta blueprint  are we still complaining about a fictitious movie that rewrote history. God forbid it uses some revisionist history for bruce lee in their universe...
those are indie stars with bland acting skills. those  asian star  are not even on tom cruise  brad pitt  will smith leonardo de caprio s league. the only real asian stars  with legit acting skills are daniel dae kim  steven yeun  henry golding  ryan potter  ross butler  manny jacinto  brian tee  charles melton  andrew kojI  ludI lin  and joe taslim
@delta blueprint  those are indie stars with bland acting skills. those  asian star  are not even on tom cruise  brad pitt  will smith leonardo de caprio s league. the only real asian stars  with legit acting skills are daniel dae kim  steven yeun  henry golding  ryan potter  ross butler  manny jacinto  brian tee  charles melton  andrew kojI  ludI lin  and joe taslim
@delta blueprint  maybe quentin hates bruce lee.  I heard that he originally planned to make bruce lee look much worse  but brad pitt and other employees talked him out of it because it was too disrespectful.  who knows.
@delta blueprint  I wouldn t take it personally.  there isn t a single person in the world who doesnt know bruce lee.  he became a legend.  he s known as the  father of mixed martial art.   he will always outshine any movie in the long run as long as m.m.a. exists.  there s no comparison at all.  the world will always appreciate his teachings.
@royce reeves  tarantino said he actually did research on bruce lee   thatshaped how he made him out in that movie. so  its more than just a fictitious world...
@gerald bataga  lol  Im sure you only listed asian actors that appeared in american movies by accident. jackie chan was actually good in the foreigner   shinjuku incident. whatever...
@brooklyn bleek  quentin s  research  was based solely on reading bit quotes from various books about bruce lee and blowing them way out of context to fit his own agenda. none of it was from interviews of witnesses or the actual authors of those books.
given that tarantino is a fan of kung fu movies  as evidenced by kill bill  and simu wasn t even referenced by him  youre not the only one. I keep forgetting that movie even came out
who
nooope.
who
simu who
who is he again
I forgot too
@adam  hu  please  avoid that joke from rush hour...
I didn t know who he was until he was cast for shang chi. I never watched kim s convenience. I have no intentions of doing so. the show is just not for me. that being said  I think the actor was a fine fit. but its clear that his politics and personal social views are in perfect alignment with the rest of leftist hollywood.
@brooklyn bleek  wait you mean the revisionist historical movie is based on real events...who knew. on a real note I dont want to be a complete ass but like bro come on clearly Im aware of that already.
simu liu acts like his movie  shang chI is first mcu project to inject asian martial arts culture.  uh...remember mcu netflix daredevil and iron fist! ! also. shangI chI fighting style was copying off 90 s jackie chan shit anyhow! get sick of this dude talking like his movie was some asian black panther 1.  no the hell it was not. not even close!
he never was a thing. that is the thing lol
was he ever a thing
Christian bale says hollywood  and the world  would be better if  white dudes  weren t in charge of everything the actor says there would be  so much better films and so much more interesting stories  if white dudes weren t running hollywood. zack sharf dec 19  2017
I never  watch  it in the first place  I watched  reviews  on it  and the movie  doesnt make sense
Ive literally never heard of this  person  Im guessing  ok I watched the video  person was correct
I forgot until this video
he never was
he s not a thing. he s a human.
@nuke crayon  the guy  movie  suck  no real  thought  was put  in the movie  to begin with.
well he did have only one movie that was big and no news of more
@liquid  he needs  a do over the next  movie  should stay close  the  og comics  books and lot of  people s  would  watch it.the most  important part  do not put  any woke crap  into it  and the woman  should  not be better than  his  just because  she a woman  do all that everything s  will be fine.
simu likes maps.
seems like right wingers dont know how to read  it clearly says simu liu  but ppl keep saying  who .
I wish  he s always making cringe posts on twitter that end up on my feed.
@dom  yeah read it right! its shitty liu!
strange  I used to watch the canadian show kim s convenience tv series. that guy was in it  but after watching the series  I still had no idea what his name was. I just knew he was in the show. I watched shang- chI and and enjoyed it  but still wasn t able to remember his name. I just called him the guy who played shang- chi.
he is not a thing.
dude does one mcu movie and he thinks he is slice bread.
he s definitely not a leading man as shang-chI showed.
simu liu is in his early 30 s  got to star in a big budget marvel movie  will be in greta gehrwig s upcoming live action barbie movie  as well as amazon s movie adaptation of the novel  seven wonders   and he will be guest starring in the simpsons as the voice of lisa s perfect boyfriend.
@delta blueprint  none of which are on my to watch lists... best of luck to him
@delta blueprint   wow  racist much  just because Im not interested in barbie  amazon adaptations  and... wait  the simpsons is still on the air  I haven t watched network tv in years. its got nothing to do with your boy. those are just low rent gigs. but please  make more asinine assumptions about me. let me know when he starts doing hallmark Christmas movies... then you know its rock bottom.
Ive seen that movie at least five times. great flick.
@blockmasterscott  the novel is even better  too.  kind of want to read it again now Im thinking about it.
phenomenally good movie
tarantino actually dedicated kill bill to fukasaku
good movie.
he also cast gordon liu as paImeI in kill bill who was master killer in 36 chambers of shaolin  and the character paImeI is carried over from the shaw brothers reoccuring villain character of the same name played by indonesian martial arts actor lo leih  of whom fought gordon liu in several movies and who starred in the 1972 kung fu movie king boxer  aka five fingers of death  which was the inspiration for creating the marvel comics character iron fist  of which was the second martial arts based character in marvel comics in 1974  six months after shang chI  master of kung-fu came out  which originally was supposed to be a comic book licenses adaptation of the 1972 kung fu tv series of which starred david carradine which bruce lee had auditioned for but was turned down by wb  who also had rejected marvel s offer of doing the comic book license adaptation  due to wb and marvel legal feuds at the time over the captain marvel name  so bruce lee then went to hong kong to film three movies which made him so famous  hollywood came calling him back for enter the dragon which came out a couple months just before shang chI comic dropped  and shang chI  since they couldnt get the license  acquired the fu manchu license instead  making shang chI an original character and fu manchu his estranged evil father  to which  once bruce lee got super famous in the u.s. after his death  the character of shang chI over the years would adopt a lot of inspiration from bruce lee  so much so thatstan lee  no relation  would eventually approach bruce lee s widow  and his son brandon lee  to be the lead in a live action shang chImovie since marvel had already made a live action punisher movie and a live action captain america movie  at this time  brandon lee was already about to do his own comic book movie the crow  and unfortunately died on set  so the shang chImovie was never made  but  when marvel was nearing bankruptcy in the late 90s and thus sold off a lot of their hero ips to various studos  blade  another superhero based off a minority  was the movie thatsaved marvel from bankrupcy.
@budgie cat  interesting
@budgie cat  gordon liu is a legend.  he also played the leader of the crazy 88s I think the bride cut off his foot  .paImeI was so great in vol. ii.  arguably the best part of the movie.
I dont even bother to search.
I cant even memorize his name oops I googled him. he will be in a movie named barbie  2023
he s also the one who fought for the theatrical release of hero  2002  back then and he got yuen woo-ping as the fight advisor for the kill bill movies.
iron monkey  I first heard of him on american dad! in one episode.
thank you so much  God bless you  _

hmm former mcu ceo ike perlmetter reportedly said something similar when they fired terrance howard and replaced him with don cheadle for the character of rhodey in the iron man movie series. thatsupposedly pissed off kevin feige a lot what he said and threatened to leave so disney let kevin work under alan horn instead.
@budgie cat  you mean former marvel entertainment ceo.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  nah he was head of everything thats why feige had to answer to him too besides marvel entertainments jeff loeb  who  jeff  continued to have to answer to him until 2019. then feige got that huge promotion end of 2019
but  sean  is a protagonist with no agency. he s overshadowed by two infinitely more compelling characters who should ve carried the movie in his stead  i.e. his sister and especially his father. resting sidekick face somehow levels up to hawkeye 2.0 within 24 hours of archery practice. his sister reaches the peak of martial arts mastery ... by watching others train from afar. riiiight. both the mandarin - a villain who could easily give the avengers a run for their money across multiple phases if not an entire saga - and tony leung - a thespian oozing with charisma and screen presence - are utterly wasted as the antagonist is killed off. instead of leaning even more heavily into the fresh tournament setting  the movie unravels into a generic cgI shitshow extravaganza come its third act.
those asian actors you mentioned are predominantly indie stars or background actors. they re not blockbuster. no one remembers them because they barely have a line  or a scene. dont blame simu  blame hollywood. hollywood wants to promote diversity  make them cast the asian actors you mentioned as leading roles. not secondary  leading roles.
@gerald bataga  simu was even more of a nobody than them prior to being cast as shang chi. and I havent seen him blow up outside said movie since. thats his point they are all better actors to him than simu.
@budgie cat  yeah they should ve casted someone like ludI lin or alex landi. at least  those actors are not arrogant or a showoff like him. the problem here is ludI lin is working with wb as liu kang. for alex landI  he mostly stars in tv shows
@gerald bataga  ludI lin woulda been great. simu is a turd.
@budgie cat  sadly  ludI lin had a contract with wb. if only rick yune  karl yune  and brian tee gets more recognition they deserve  they should ve been the one casted and not awkwafina and shang chI s sister. they ve been in the business for decades now and barely have a leading role.
@budgie cat  ludI lin has the looks and the charm. simu liu got mad when people starts calling a below average man on social media
@gerald bataga  simu looks like president winnie the poo
@budgie cat  if they could change hulk s actor  then I dont mind them recasting simu. a lot of fans have been wanting to recast him because of his arrogance on social media or because he looks so average
@gerald bataga  they changed hulk s actor for dumb reasons though. ed norton was a way better bruce banner than mark ruffalo who s only gotten worse over the years. he always comes off like a moron. its probably also the writing though because when he played the scientist father of ryan renolds in that time travel movie he actually came off as smart.but disney bought marven in 2009 so a lot of the changes they made were due to disney s intervention. and one of them was getting rid of ed norton because God forbid they have actors writers that can actually think for themselves and not be puppets for the disney machine.
@gerald bataga  I dont think he s gonna get recast  some people wanted leticia wright  evangeline lily and rosario dawson  star wars  recast but that never happened.the only cancelelation was gina carano  from mandalorian.well actually mcu recast cassie lang actress but I have no idea why
@budgie cat  it might be possible for him to be recasted. his attitude on social media is probably what s gonna lead him to his downfall. one wrong tweet and they re gonna fire him.
he is like david cage and hideo kojjima of cinema
he borrows steals all his ideas from western cinema and is overrated
@james bee   references  in sophisticated and complex stories  is not considered borrowing stealing.  in that respect  tarentino s movies are pastiches of a wide range of cinema  from spaghettI westerns to samuraI valve is overrated
imagine tarantino and kojima working together in a movie or videogame! would be an awesome collab for sure  I have always wanted kojima to do a movie  I really love every single cutscene of the mgs series
@james bee  you technically described most of the movie industry...
@neam raven   you been listening to too much razorfist.  what are you basing this on   given his liberal use of the n word and depicts violence against women  l would say otherwise.and he basically said to ignore political correctness when he was on joe rogan
@purple pill philosophy  who s razorfist  I remember tarantino taking part in blm riots and such.
lol evidently mr. scorseeze has been mispronouncing his own name as well.
@marx bane  he did not  it happened when his parents arrived in america. the guards mispelled their names. it happened a lot with italian  immigrants
@revan 1313  I was kidding based on her mispronouncing his name throughout the video.  my entire life Ive heard it pronounced score-say-zee and never seen him correct it if thats wrong.  my people came to this country with a hard to spell and pronounce name as well so it was changed somewhere along the way.  Im glad we dont really do that anymore.
@marx bane  ah ok. got ya
@marx bane  same here about the pronunciation. Ive heard it pronounced score-see-zee  too  but mostly the other way.
score-say-see
yeah me to.... I thought it was  score-sus  when I heard the actual pronunciation I thought what the f@ k is a  score say zee   and then I realise everyone pronounce it that way  so I figured I was wrong hahahah
tarentino  movie stars aren t movie stars anymore.simu ........................racism!
just a reality check on who s more relevant  I didn t have to google who quentin tarantino is.
disney needs to put a leash on this one cause this is the 2nd time he went all bonkers
to me it reads as simu  has fallen into the trap that most people seem to fall into these days. he heard what quinten said second hand  or only heard a part of what he said from some article and jumped to his conclusion. if he looked into it fully he would have seen that quinten wasn t even putting down the actors in the movies or even the movies themselves  he was lamenting the fact that movies with established ip s and fanbases seem to be the only thing that hollywood is focused on any more.his gripe isn  t really with the  marvel-ization  of hollywood  cause that was just the best solution studios came up with to the actual problem  which is the digitalization of movies. being able to pirate and stream movies online has indirectly forced studios to change how they promote movies and what movies they make  because the only movies that make enough money to be worth making are ones that are as guaranteed as can be to make a profit  or at least not make a loss. and that is movies with established fanbases. the only other movies that get made movies with a budget so that its not as hard to make back the money that went into it  like blumhouse movies. the tl dr is  simu  like so many other people these days  needs to do his research before he decides to go pubic with every little thought he has...
he likes to ignore the achievements of asian actors that came before him. such an inflated opinion of himself.
shang chI was forgettable the best friend  loudx obnoxious   the sister  feminism  Im better than you    and the ending dragon thing messed him up
torentino made a great point about the movie being bigger than the star  I dont see why that passes the dude off  torentino is practically fighting for you and other actors  dude. but it is telling  that I only know this man as shang chi
looks like he never had the tiger parents he needed in his life to mold him into a better  grounded person of knowledge  wisdom  experience  humility  piety  and virtue.
I ll consider taking simu liu seriously as soon as he explains what  point their nose at me  means.
simu liu  quintin tarintino is a racist!also simu liu  can I have a role in a movie now
the funny thing is  super hero themed shows movies can be profound and as thought provoking as a taratino film. batman the animated series has won numerous awards for its story telling. the problem with mcu is that its cheap  amazon quality product that is dumb downed for children and is more stuffed with awful jokes than a thanksgiving turkey. I think the actor is salty because he realizes this  that the works he is in are not as profound as he d like them to be  and this bruises his ego.
scorsees  lmao. if gary or az said it  I d be like  come on man  really   but from melonie  its just adorable
score-say-zee.   also  unlike some other actors  robert downey jr. has had a lot of other roles beside iron man.  his sherlock holmes roles are amusing.
well  that explains why samuel l jackson was in six of his movies... he s keeping an eye on him.
happy thanksgiving to you and your family mel. and isn t that the guy from a sitcom that 10 people saw before he was picked because of his skin color
simu liu be living in a simulation
and just who is simu liu  exactly.
what can you say  actors.  we need to make two lists.  one with issues.  and the other without issues.  I think the latter would be a short list.  the ones that dont seem to have issues have class and they have studied the craft.  most of my favorite actors have a background in theater.  Im not interested in seeing real human behavior in my entertainment.  I want to see the art in the craft.  but it also needs to make sense.
you are soo amazing the way you can articulate what s in your head is something else
I didn t even know who simu liu was until I heard of someone call him  the guy that played the asian black panther .
it really is remarkable. its like a movie where the people are crazy and only call out certain people for being racist. the white boogeyman is like a movie.
anthony mackie  falcon  said the same thing tarantino said 5 years ago. and simu didnt say shit. simu only feel emboldened to speak out cause tarantino isnt part of the disney machine and he s  white
he did the same thing when chapek talked about the 45 day wait between theater to streaming experiment. he mistook shang-chI as the experiment and took it personally. seriously  simu needs to pay attention and stop looking so unprofessional.
he is just reactionary type of guy.
those are indie stars with bland acting skills. those  asian star  like jackie chan  bruce lee  the kill bill girl are not even on tom cruise  brad pitt  will smith leonardo de caprio s league. the only real asian stars  with legit acting skills are daniel dae kim  steven yeun  henry golding  ryan potter  ross butler  manny jacinto  brian tee  charles melton  andrew kojI  ludI lin  and joe taslim
yep Im sick and tired of people making a sob story of how they are an  inspiration  to younger folk and how they  broke the glass ceiling  and pushed through the patriarchy or racism and gave a voice to their people! its all a tactic to make themselves even more famous in the eyes of the public because at the end of the day they just want brownie points to be able to stay in the spotlight
@gerald bataga  Ive never even heard of any of those  real asian stars  you mentioned.
@the destroyer2alltrolls  its your problem. compared to 75 million people who knew them
@gerald bataga  lol jackie trumps them all
bahahaha
simu scored a role in greta gehrwig s new live-action barbie  movie with ryan gosling and margot robbie. why does he need quentin tarantino  its not like quentin would cast an asian man as the lead actor before or anytime soon.
quentin
you know  melone  in german means a cantaloupe
wow  six of them  I never realized it was that many!
ok  jackie brown  pulp fiction  hateful 8 and django unchained  what are the other 2
@geeebuttersnap  a small part in kill bill vol. 2 and the narator who introduces stiglitz in inglourious basterds.
@n7 tigger  really  he was in kill bill 2  Im gonna have to look it up  I have no memory of that  which doesnt say a lot because Im always forgetful lol.
@geeebuttersnap  jackie brown was awesome! I loved sam s ponytail lol!
simu liwho
tarantino could write a better script and screenplay on a napkin at lunch than any of these people involved with hollywood today could ever dops. irrelevance loves making noise and pointing fingers
I forgot about that movie that I never watched or wanted to watch.  I didn t even know his name  and I already forgot it again just now.
dont give up on your dream melonie  you can still grow up to be and look like lara croft
they could have gotten tom cruz to play the role. it would have made a billion
stumbled onto your channel a few weeks ago  and been loving your content.
I dont see simu in a scorsees movie any time soon.
the mcu s biggest problem right now  and there is a list   is that they are actively chasing away the diehard fans to pander to a fanbase that doesnt care about the ip at all. most diehard fans want to see the comics and cartoon heroes and villains  come to life    and now we have the sfx to do it and make it look good. but they are being served twisted and nerfed perversions of those characters called by the same names and they are justifiably passed off.
liu probably forgot bruce lee s movies  jackie chan s  the karate kid movies  the last samuraI  and of course kill bill  uma thurman dressed in bruce lee yellow suit while swinging katana  come on .
martin scorsese   pronounced  score-say-zee. you weren t far off
he should have kept kim s convenience going through a spin-off.  then he would have had to deal with the great appa   stop! every time you gossip  you make the baby Jesus cry.  mel happy tomb raider thanksgiving.  okseeyou
score says see.  pronounced  as such.   j2lyk.  he s a really a legendary director.
I said  orville  Imight have a story  and he said to me  what s the significance of the story   and I said to him   orville  not every story has to have significance  you know  sometimes a story is just a story. you try to read into every little thing and find meaning in everything anyone says you ll just drive yourself crazy.  - mr. hippo  ultimate custom night
tarantino has 2 oscars and 10 nominations.  how many does simu have
simu wants to be the bride in the kill bill reboot.
his best performance was on that korean grocery show  lol.
12 00 look up to her and daydream that one day I could be as cool as her one day  which obviously would never happen but my sister in Christ  youre already as cool as her!!
shang-chImade what it made simply because it has the marvel studios logo in the opening credits  otherwise it would be a random straight to tv movie.  that film was the epitome of mid.simu liu pretty is pretty much an example of what tarantino said.  I legit kept forgetting his name before the tarantino tweet.  I just remembered him as  the shang chI guy .
gundala was pretty good. kind of bummed by don lee getting pulled in by the m she u  he still has a handful of great korean gangster movies though . one of the few channels on amazon that is overall pretty good is the hiyah channel. divine fury is also an excellent combo of the exorcist with kungfu flicks where the protagonist literally beats the demons out of people. my itch for great asian flicks is covered without the hollywood progressivism mucking  em up too bad.
I see a new video from melonie mac  I watch  I like   side note  I completely forgot the real name of the actor for shang chI until now. but benedict wong from dr strange would absolutely crush him
I guess he never saw django unchained.
I am also obsessed with tomb raider  which is one of the reasons I subscribed to this channel.
this simu liu has bugged me so much even right before joining disney  he was suddenly everywhere like the next big thing  and continues for some quite good while after the movie released. disney sure is feisty with their buzzers.
I fear you underestimate your power  and by that Imean  you would look outstanding as lara croft.
oh hell no he didn t just go after my main man quentin tarantino thats a losing battle right there
the 3 spidey flicks were just a roundabout origin story arc to get him to officially become the local friendly neighborhood version people know. no problem...
martin score-say-see.  Im sure you ve heard the name mentioned along with tarantino in the past.  they re the two biggest names in quality films  hands down.
simu liu would not have lasted in the heyday of jackie chan  bruce lee  and jet li.
Im a big fan of tarantino  dont really care about the soulless factory made mcu movies. but honestly disney has been targeting tarantino for a while now  maybe because he doesnt want to join disney. but the first time this was made public was the hateful 8 vs force awakens. when disney bought out all the movie theaters  just so tarantino would fail. and the sad part was when everyone was attacking tarantino  not knowing what disney would do to star wars.
shang chI s silent cameo in  avengers  earth s mightiest heroes  was a thousand times better than simu liu in  the legend of the bad dad bracelets and the bestest women ever
I saw an ad with him promoting a condo in downtown toronto with his name attached to it. if the movie actor thing ever fizzles out of irrelevance  he can always become a real estate agent since thatseems more of his calling.
I would love to see a reaction from sam jackson. based response from crowder  too.
ur spider man point is legit. I almost cant stand how soft and lame they made him. I couldn t figure out what was wrong with him and u nailed it I think.
quentin hears a liu. the lius must shout  we are here! we are here! we are here!  as loud as they can so their speck of mcu will get a sequel.
simu did make good points  and hes working on barbie and some other movies.... quentin also made some good point aswell
scorcese and tarantino are masters of their craft. artists seek them out and pray that they can be in their movies  the top artists the real movies stars! super hero movies are fun except for the joker which is my opinion is a masterpiece
tarantino is right but I think probably the one exception to it is chris hemsworth. because of how everyone else in avengers already had names prior to the franchise with the exception of him and tom hilddleston. but after thor popped out we started seeing chris hemsworth everywhere and then out of nowhere we find out he has a brother in the business too and all that. so I think chris hemsworth and maybe tom holland as the exception to what tarantino said
happy belated melonie! mine is today! keep doing you girl and dont let no one tell you different! and if I remember correctly I think francis ford coppola got on this train by calling it factory filmmaking or something like that. valid points all around.
if you took simu liu s iq and converted it into energy you might be able to burn some toast.
I wish I actually spend my days on something instead of just a tiny few things and then just zone out
@melonie mac go boom simu liu and this whole situation aside  shang chI is surprisingly decent. its one of the few pieces of content out of all of phase 4 Ive actually enjoyed  so far.
thanks for the endless love and support you have constantly shown me  in such difficult moment. Im forever grateful. I really appreciate your unconditional love to me and every effort exerted by you to cause a change where are you watching from
fr. u dont go after the goats.
tarantino cast the legendary sonny chiba in kill bill  a man simu liu will never be.
simu liu crazy for this shouldn t have even responded
80s action movies are high art
I wish we could send most of their new content to a different universe.
shang chI is literally a bootleg of a superhero movie  which ironically was made specifically to kiss the ccp s ego.
any criticism of a production I am in is a direct attack on my person.  - terrible hollywood employees
every time you say martin scorsese s name I die  ya ain t wrong in what youre saying.  ya just kill me with that pronunciation edit  so this didn t age well  this is why I should listen to the whole thing before commenting lolz.  I disagree to one thing  end game was sub par compared to what they could have given us.  they did thanos dirty  he should have worshiped lady death.  we should have gotten a sexy lady death  instead of the pc message of over population that we got.  joker was brilliant
pronounced  score-say-z.   happy thanksgiving melonie
melonie  you make my day
this guy peaked when his body was pulled apart in the expanse
scorsees  lol. she s doing it on purpose now . and the inevitable lara detour. melonie  are you going to be watching reviewing willow  I love the original movie and Im not sure I can bring myself to watch the new show.
you rock melonie.
I wish phase 4 was an alternate universe or uncanny
Im just here to simp for melonie
its kind of impressive how fast simu liu has risen to be one of the most insufferable people in hollywood.
marvel directors are like session musicians
you hit the nail on the head it really seem like a grudge there.
he only got the hype when got the shang chI role and buzzfeed couldn t shut up about him. they made articles saying the same thing  that he has  funny  and  relatable  tweets and he was a stock photo model. he must have think it will last.
I absolutely dont agree with everything tarantino said in his article but the way simu reacted like a toddler just made me agree with tarantino more lmao
Im dyin here at score-cease
those are indie stars with bland acting skills. those  asian star  like jackie chan bruce lee the kill bill girl  jet lI and mister miyagI guy are not even on tom cruise  brad pitt  will smith leonardo de caprio s league. the only real asian stars  with legit acting skills are daniel dae kim  steven yeun  henry golding  ryan potter  ross butler  manny jacinto  brian tee  charles melton  andrew kojI  ludI lin  and joe taslim
is there a story behind the  scorsees  thing that Imissed
@darthgorbag  she struggles with pronunciation or mispronounces stuff all the time. its adorable. in this one she kept saying scorsees instead of scorsese
I thought its like scorsese watching
its canon what you want it to be canon.
the problem with simon liu believes that money is more important than talent.
scor-tze -see  you ve heard the name like a 1000 times but I bet you never saw how its written. the only reason I know it is because I saw it once at a shop where they had the cc turned on
the only thing I remember from that movie  is him being kicked in the balls 30 minutes in and apparently he never recovered.
he reminds me of this scene from got joffrey   I am the king! tywin   any man who must say  I am the king  is no true king.
Ive always wanted quentin tarantino to do a prototype story the games were ok the comic books show the gap in between games one and two but even if he reworked it with a different protagonist antagonist I would still love to see what he comes up with the games themselves just really dont have any depth to them Im sure that he could make one hell of a story
the most tiresome thing about wokies is that they all sound exactly the same. they use the same words in the same order  and always have the same intonations when you hear them in person. its like they get a brain download of the latest script in their sleep or something.
infinity war was so freaking good!!!no argument from me on that one    watched that one no fewer than five times  and I feel like thats not enough
I d say let s make a melonie mac drinking game in which whenever she mentions tomb raider or lara croft we take a shot....but we d all be dead before her videos were done. lol    j k melonie  we all have some franchise we love just as much and mention whenever we feel it fits.
hes crazy.  tarantino always want to work with jackie chan  but jackie rejects it.
Im with you on dc. my guy will always be superman. Im really hoping they get their act together as far pushing a storyline like marvel did...originally.
5 09 well sadly the film didn t do well in china for a bunch of reasons  they didn t like the bad guy because even thought marvel changed the name they still remember the old comics  granted thats not disney s fault  they also didn t like the lead actor for a few reasons 1 been they felt he looked to chinese  apparently its some odd idea that a normal chinese person cant be a hero   also some thought he was too good looking.so sadly for reasons beyond his control he probably wont be getting another lead role and will only get another mcu gig if they need to do something that brings in another martial artist character  the girl playing his sister has a much better shot as the ten rings is quite widespread in the mcu so they could show up in lots of places from the thunderbolts to armour wars and anything else that might run across criminal activity  a hero needing info that they cant get from official sources or trying to stop tech been smuggled but they can also replace her with a nobody thats cheaper  thats the great thing about not seeing the leader of a secretive organisation you never see the leader.
I unfortunately did watch shang chI  on streaming  not the theater . it wasn t terrible  but it wasn t good. it was just ok. an aggressively middling 5 10. all I can really say is that it was the least worst of the m-she-u stage 4 movies  which is not a high bar. it was incredibly bland  not particularly engaging  but the story did at least fit together well enough to follow  but not excite or inspire . it felt like a movie  unlike some these days which feel like a series of largely unrelated vignettes that have been strung together to approximate something like a film. as for simu liu  he wasn t what I d call bad in the movie  but he certainly wasn t good either. he was essentially a non-entity. virtually any nobody  pick any busboy around hollywood  could ve been in the role and it wouldn t have changed. thats how little impact his presence makes. he s not at all compelling as an actor  and he has the charisma of a paper bag. in fact  brie larson has more on-screen presence  Im not even joking. I can just imagine the director saying   aaand action!  then nothing happens  and he says   I said action  go ahead and act.  then simu liu says   I was!  thats how impactful he is as an actor.Im not even slamming him because I dont like him. yes  he s a douche  but there are tons of actors in hollywood like that who you cant deny are talented. this guy is not that.
subscribed. love your takes! love your hair!
shang chI 2  the legend of the shadow trainer xialingshang chI 3  the legend of the 5-minute lesson in archery
didn t tarantino create django unchained  with a black hero and a white man playing a villain  and that movie is fantastic its one of my favourites of his.dont forgot about jackie brown or launching samuel jackson into stardom after pulp fiction
Imade it through half of shang chI and couldn t finish.  wokeness wasn t too bad  movie s just kind of boring and awkwafina s character made me want to shove an ice pick through my eye. ps - happy belated birthday!
the only other job simu has ever done was having a small role in the short-lived taken tv series.....but u wouldn t really notice him there anyways.
great content as always. dont really want to correct you as the way you say it is cute but its pronounced score-zay-zee  -
tarantino didn t even say anything bad  its just a fact. dont know why simu felt attacked but itsounds like a personal problem
maybe he is trying to get on tarantino s radar. if anyone could make him a true star it would be him.
damn I didn t know this. I wish we got some yen wu ping choreographed  jet lI vs jackie written and directed by qt.
@brian medina  those are indie stars with bland acting skills. those  asian star  are not even on tom cruise  brad pitt  will smith leonardo de caprio s league. the only real asian stars  with legit acting skills are daniel dae kim  steven yeun  henry golding  ryan potter  ross butler  manny jacinto  brian tee  charles melton  andrew kojI  ludI lin  and joe taslim
it didn t get permission to be released in chinese theatres  part of it is due to simu liu s comments about how his parents were happy to escape china and its not that he was too good looking  but that they thought thatsimu liu was too ugly.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
shang chI was a desecration of the comics. imagine bruce lee being the son of fu manchu  raised to be an assasin  rejected his first kill  turned his back on his father and sister  didn t want to play the great game on the british side either  but tried to walk through life s difficult choices honorably.
shang chI was nerfed. despite being created in 1973. they retconned his origins in the comics circa 2015 and also the mandarin s. possibly to virtue signal the  horrible mistake   lol  of getting the fu manchu license back in 73  since thats a  racially insensitive character   like where were all the people complaining abot this in the 70 s  80 s. 90 s and 00 s  lol more like they didnt wanna keep paying for the license once disney bought marvel . and the mandarin was one of iron man s strongest villains hence them trying to adapt him into iron man 3 with...horrible results which they later tried to course correct in shang chI with chinese actor tony leung  who lets be honest   thats the asian character people cameto see not simu liu or lol akwafina and so in the comics  shang chI for decades had nothing to do with the mandarin or his rings.shang chI on his own was a powerful character. much like iron fist and dc s karate kid  who once ducked punches from supernboy   shang chI is supposed to have such a mastery of chI that he can shatter almost any solid object and dodge bulletsbut in this movie  he was just good at kung fu that he trained at from age 5 to 14.  lol what and his sister trained herselfactually regarding her  in the comics  shang chin never had a sisterhe only got sisters in the comics in the same year the movie went into production lol disney is so full of woke shitall the dumb woke shit we ve seen in the marvel comics lately thats been making their comic sales plummet  is all the dumb shit disney has been grooming since them buying marvel in 2009 to eventually adapt into the mcu.starting with the abysmal captain marvel comics reboot of 2012 with carol becoming captain marvel  and her comics sales being so bad it had to be rebooted 7 times since  yet mcu cleverly shoehorned her movie in between infinity war and endgame securing its success as it fooled people to  must see  it even though it wasnt required viewing.and yeah all these wackass characters  rirI williams  kate bishop  america chavez  kamala khan and the inhumans  captain marvel carol danvers  all a ultra progressive grooming push to eventually be put into the mcu from the comics division. even the shitty ass version of she-hulk we got was done so because they hired shitty marvel comics she-hulk writer dana schwartz  and what if miles morales shitty writer codey ziglar to be writers for the ahsow in addition to jessixca cow.instead of hiring actual good she-hulk writers like john byrne or dan slott.
so basically its just another overhyped marvel movie gotcha

gatekeeper  tarantino gave liu and other asians a huuuge opportunity to star in a big film... Im speaking  of course  about lucy liu.
I like the part in shang-chI where he got kicked in the nuts by his cooler  more powerful  sister who didn t need no stinkin  training
Im so happy static shock as a dc character
shang chI and the legend of the ten rings was good and his 1st gig was the show kim s convenience in canada.
1 07.. nah  it wasn t good. but it absolutely had potential! now I didn t know anything about shang chI before seeing the movie.. but I liked shang chi. I liked simu as the character they were showing me. I didn t like how they had him get kicked in the balls and embarassed by his sister.. but I can forgive most of the movie! there was potential! there really was.. shang chI  his sister  the father.. all cool characters! the reason I say there was potential is because of the story got reworked a bit.. like honestly just a bit.. give more focus to those three characters specifically and their family dilemma.. there could have been a good movie there! just have him and his sister team up to face their father. tell thatstory! the biggest problem I had with the movie  the issue that has become so unforgivable that even tho its not horrible  I will never watch it again. katy.shang chI s best friend. she is a completely made up character. never existed before this movie. wasn t in the comics.. completely made up. the actress playing katy has the most annoying voice Ive ever heard. he character was obnoxious. absolutely a pointless character! but she was in the entire movie! they just needed that two female to one male dynamic. then katy joins the fight. no. go away. then she makes this insane hawkeye level bow and arrow shot after just a few moment of training with the bow to save shang chi. bullshit! go away katy!!then the film ends  the avengers come to get shang chi.. and they tell katy to come too..  !!!! no! fuck off katy! and there karen marvel and the cuck talking with both shang chI and fucking katy!! what the fuck.. !! why would the avengers bring katy !!! its a nobody character! completely pointless and could have been removed completely and made zero difference to the movie! the actress was incredibly annoying! fuck off!! the worst fuckin characater in all of phase 4!! wow  I haven t thought of katy in a while but my rage has returned! even after all the rest of what we saw in phase 4 is still putting fucking katy at the top of my list as my most hated part of phase 4!the movie should have just been the story of shang chI s sister reluctantly coming to get him and then the two of them going to face their father. tell thatstory.
scorsese   Ive never heard his name pronounced this way.  was confused for a second.
love this channel  boom boom
yeah simu just cemented my decision to never watch shang-sklee...
just fyI  because it doesnt really matter  scorsese is  score-say-zee . its the wolf of walstreet director  and the departed  I think casino  goodfellas  etc.I dont care  though...I thought it was endearing.
well there was no mcu anywhere  when there was 3 blade movies already!
by creating heroes... wait  they finally created their own properties instead of just dumping on pre-existing ones...
disney forced tarantino out of the theaters.
alright new video. good to see ya melonie
I just saw a video about croft engine. since melonie is a tomb raider fan  I thought she d be interested. its a framework with lots of enhancements for the old tr games
wow  I ll be the first to say that Im not a tarantino fan  but that dude is one of the totally non racist people out there. he s not even close to being a bigot.
wouldn t someone have to point their nose at him in order to pay attention to him
shang chI is actually one of the more enjoyable phase 4 movies
I would just be like  calm down  operation condor.
to be fair  shang chI was probably the best phase 4 thing
martin  score sees  - love it
no  lucy liu had already starred in the big budget blockbuster  charlie s angels 1 and 2   and played a gang boss character in mel gibson s  payback  revenge film  basically the same character as in tarantino s kill bill vol. 2  nothing new . lucy got her big break on the 90 s comedy tv show allie mcbeal  where she was promoted from minor recurring character to series regular. thats where it all started. quentin tarantino cast her in kill bill 2 because she was already famous  and probably the only asian actress who was recognizable to american audiences at that time.
@delta blueprint  are youreally that dense
good to see you in the comments as always  _
@melonie mac go boom
but the point remains  do you call him by his name or as shang chI guy  he isn t a movie star and is butthurt because some facts were said
@jack john  oh I pretty much agree with everything in this vid haha
yes  it was very good.  its too bad liu seems determined to turn us away from the franchise with his ongoing dumb takes.
not because of simu liu  it was mostly because of tony leoung
speaking of irrelevant  tarantino s best film was his debut.
social media allowed movies stars to destroy themselves.  they no longer shine.
the multiverse has always been apart of marvel and dc. back in the late 90 s marvel and dc even did a cross over series called marvel vs. dc. after the initial series amalgam comics was born  which was various marvel characters that had fused with dc characters as a result of their respective universes colliding. like batman and wolverine  captain america and superman  and so on. the multiverse is a huge part of comics.
I like your channel melonie!
to be fair shang chI was pretty decent.  one of the better movies they released after end game.
watch the movie  its a good movie. it didn t have any decent marketing but its a pretty nice one in the scheme of things. its not in the sjw category for marvel movies from what I felt watching it. it felt like a good standalone marvel movie that didn t rely on utilizing other characters to save it  or throw under the bus.  hI shehulk
black widow was incredible.
score-sees movie  I do not believe I am familiar with that particular filmmaker.
funny thing is if they had planned this out properly they could have killed the original characters in infinity wars and then replace them in phase 4. not it makes these movies any better but context would make sense and add gravitas to the original heroes sacrifice.
happy thanksgiving to your family mel!
I still haven t seen shan chI . and grew up with the comic .and I have thatservice .
rdj and chris hemsworth prior to his retirements  still had careers otherwise  simu s just butthurt about tarantino dropping truth bombs!
@melonie mac go boom  great video and commentary as always. I do miss your Bible verse of the day at the end of your videos  though.
phase 1-3 of the mcu was exciting from a cinematic production standpoint  no other movie series in history has had so many characters collaborating  the movies didn t need to be exceptional because the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.
happy belated  meloniemacgoboom!   welcome to club36!
4 35 um...yes. it is a collaborative effort. have you already forgotten gina carano s story of what was going on behind the scenes of her social media on the lead-up to her firing
bruh what shang chI was fire
scorsese   scores easy. seems legit xd
happy belated birthday  melanie.
I agree with all u said except with joker being a masterpiece
and I like you! thank you so much!  d
namor s package was digitally removed in wakanda forever because shurI was distracted by it and almost went nuts during the final battle. if they cast simu as namor   it  wouldn t be a problem. the green speedo can cover any bulge not exceeding 2 inches.
scoreceeeese
shang shi. while the end fight was sort of cringey  it didnt detract too much from the simple story. which had a fresh back to basics feel  that hasnt been done since doctor strange imo. didnt care too much for the end credits where the sister takes up the mantle out of nowhere even though they just fought side by side. by far not the worst p4 content ive seen I give it a solid b was excited for more but now Im worried he is going try to bring more of his politics to the film. was surprised he didn t make a cameo in strange multiverse of madness seeing as wong could have used him against maximoff.
I will say  midnight suns has nailed comic book peter parker  at least in his personality
I for one just want to applaud disney for being the first company or major studio to hire minority actors! they definitely dont get enough credit for going against the grain and bucking the hollywood system by going woke.beavo disney  and bavo mcu!!
wasn t simu in crazy rich asian  and I think he was in the tv series fresh of the boat  so he s done a few things if Im right.
some day people will finally realize actors are not famous because they are smart. it will be a great day.
shang-chI is just ok its not great. his best friend whose never fought or held a bow landed a killshot on a crazy demon dragon thing after like a day of archery training while men who clearly trained their whole lives all died around her.
simu lu is mad because he wasn t even the star of his own movie. that role went to a somehow less talented tiktok star
tarantino created iconic characters and scenes from scratch. he didn t rely on pre established comics  stories or characters. agree or disagree  what he said should make people think. simu isn t thinking.
only thing I remember about shang chI is the to critter with a butt for a face.  the rest of it  I d haveta rewatch to tell ya the plot.  if thatsays anything.
joker is the only one  that actually uses a character from dc universe to tell a human complex story  not a story of a superhero who saves the day  as martin says with different variations of the same script  I totally agree with tarantino and scorsese.   the joker is a brilliant movie in my opinion  and its a totally different animal from the franchised movies  as far as I know was not an oficial dc movie . I grew with comics  my era of superhero comics was from 76 to 84 then in europe a different kind of comic came to be popular with adult content  it was comic magazines type mad magazine but with european modernist approach   they have a segment for american authors   but it was independent comic   we had people like alan moore   milo manara  hugo pratt and others   and  this shift was an obvious step from child to adult teenager   I remember buying comics regularly at 21 24 years old. comics  magazines  and graphic novels  that had  nothing to do with superheroes  which  I still liked of course   but I left behind      I had a second age when my kids  born   and it was the time of the first marvel movies   we love them   we love transformers  and of course  the visuals were astounding   it was everything so new  that it was amazing  those fx finally came to help to visualice  and boost stories that we had only imagined in our brains when kids     today  my kids are nearly 30   and we move on    they play videogames  of course titles like spiderman  but they dont see the movies anymore  same as me  and we love them   I even subscribed to disney   to try to reconnect with those happy times  and see all the movies I haven t see  in nearly 20 years cause  now I find myself living alone  so it was a way to going back to those days  and I swear that I started the first movie and after 10 minutes I fell asleep   I tried again and again fell asleep...  .... I had two months the disney s subscription  I didn t succeed in any attempt to finish watching any movie I started    I understand the emotional connection we have with our infancy  superhero movies and comics reinforced those values that were passed onto us by the previous generation. the good should prevail  the justice  the fight against evil. its too powerful to simply get rid of it  these superheroes will go all the journey with you. but that doesnt mean we shouldn t evolve and add other experiences and values  learn as we get older  never stop to learn  and dont get stuck in the ladder.    my connection with that world is not disney or wb   its you guys  I love to hear from you all about those loved characters that I still love but I cant no longer feel as I used to do  I bought the last month two books of tintin from herge another of my heroes  and I support young artists around me  but Im no longer going to give more money to those corporations  those are precisely the villains of the story  who stole the ip and need it to complete their evil plan to rule the world  ja jaja    so painful to see how these companies destroy something so beautiful  but remember they cant destroy what its inside you  the spirit of those characters that you have as yours  those are your powers.       edit    I love lara croft   we bought the ps1 and the first game tomb raider around 2001  but my kids were so small to play it  they play but they cant do the difficult and amazing jumps that first game had and my wife was a disaster  so I had to get the control and be lara croft for them  it was really difficult   I was a good pac man  and space invaders in my days   but this was way out of my league  it took me more than one month to finish it  cause I had to work and work hard and simply I came to home so tired that it was impossible to really make amazing things  normally it was the weekends  those three or four weekends are among the most wonderful of my entire life
at least anthony mackie admits he s not famous like older actors and when people see him  they first think falcon  or clarence if youre cultured . he s right that famous ips sell movies more than most actors nowadays. spider-man is one of the most known superheroes of all time and look how it blew up the actor s namesake in the mainstream. anytime you see maguire  garfield  or holland you think spider-man. plenty of people thought garfield sucked prior to no way home despite him having the best credentials now due to awards and nominations and his work with big name directors because they were clouded by the lackluster spider-man franchise sony gave him.
put another dollar in the  talk about tomb raider  jar
simu liu is a multi-talented and multi-layered entertainer. first off he is perfect fluent in both american english and mandarin chinese.  he can do comedy  he s proficient in martialarts  he can do stunt work  he can sing  he can dance  he can play the guitar  he is a great public speaker and serve as a show host.  I cant name many other actors as versatile as he is  and he s still young while guys like tom cruise are getting old.
11 minutes before tomb raider reference. I think thats a new record.
hImelonie I just wanted say.I hope your birthday was really nice for you may you your family have a blessed wonderful remaining of this year.takecare melonie
so I have to say I disagree with a few of the things stated during this interview and from you as well. one being the statement about character development and revelations missing from the mcu  he said he hasn t watched them  there is loads of that done very well over the whole first 3 phases and done in a more grounded way than the comics which they mostly follow for parts of the whole. if he sat and watched them and maybe read some of the comics he might get that. secondly your opinions on spiderman in the mcu  I think he did bring the childlike comedy of early spiderman. most of what he could do was what parents would want to see their own high school kids actually acting like  so good guy spiderman as you put it  but if they let him become washing out of college to be spiderman peter parker  we might just get thatsnarkier side of him  feel he s just too young right now to really give that feeling and its not a bad thing yet. agree with everything else you stated during your video. appreciate your hard work and the video melonie! p.s. happy late birthday!
when trying to be a chad after staring in one safe ass marvel movie goes wrong.
happy thanksgiving  melonie. keep up the good work.
I dont think he was in crazy rich asians  maybe   and I dont remember him on fresh off the boat.
did this dude forget jackie chan  donnie yen and jet lI exist
everyone is forgetting he canadian  and I just think he given his honest thoughts on quintin. one of my favorite directors of all time. but I feel like alot people are taken this out of context.
anthony mackie pointed out what tarantino said a while ago  that the movie hero has outgrown the actor that played this hero  kinda funny  anthony mackie is rrrrraaaaceeeeee - ist then
score-say-zeelove your vids  mel.
I relate marvel movies and directors to mcdonald s they re everywhere they re mass produced and they re dull to the palate. there are some quality pieces on the menu. in thatsame metaphor  movies from directors like tarantino and scorsese are like five star michelin restaurants where the product is refined and exquisite. simu is the discarded happy meal toy.
he s just mad he lost to wesley crusher  wil wheaton  on celebrity jeopardy.
I think tarantino is an extremely skilled movie maker. which is a shame  because all he ever makes is garbage movies about garbage people.
not all the phase 4 movies imo have been terrible. sure some were sprinkled watered down with some wokiness but by in large I liked the movies. I wouldn t claim them to be masterpiece material. granted I haven t seen immortals or the new black panther and I think Im forgetting a few. the shows however were trash with the exception of wanda vision and what if.
did he ever watch a tarantino film  am I colorblind or what
personally  Im not really into the whole super-hero movie type stuff. its just not my sort of thing. I d rather watch something like blade runner or alien or terminator dozens of times than almost anything churned out lately even once. and its just crazy how willing they are to insult and condemn such large swathes of pre-existing fandom with their race-baiting and condescending attitudes.
how to make sure you fade fast away and forgotten   open your mouth as an actor with an opinion
melonie  you mispronouncing names and words is definitely becoming your signature.
tarantino has some of the most memorable non white characters ever.  imho of course.
waaaahhh! but I wanna be worshiped by everyone! really I cant wait for all the comic movies to slow down or go away. I always thought it would be cool to have this but now I just wish we could get a break or something.
superhero movies dont have to suck.  a good director could make a good film in any genre.  we ve just gotten used to subpar superhero films by incompetents.
score-say-z
tarantino made the nager storage scene but I would still have a milkshake with them and hang out because fucking quentin tarantino. he s the reason sam jackson is where he is right now and I appreciate that.
tarantino was talking about the actor being overshadowed by the super hero role they were playing and that guy somehow made it about race. he s not even relevant. tarantino probably doesnt even know who that guy is until now.
hey at 305 of the video she made a funny voice it would be funny if she did a whole video talking like that
man oh man  I ll say this as the biggest berserk fan there is  I rarely talk about it these days   but youre definitely obsessed with lara croft and tomb raider.  d haha ...completely agree with martin scorsese s assessment of modern cinema  which isn t just his  opinions  but are facts  save for joker  2019  which was a truly exceptional work of art. there s nothing to  disagree  with when it comes to what he said  because the reality is over 90  of films made nowadays aren t art or cinema  but theme park rides. its like you said though  thats okay.
what s the context
@boogie  miss interpreting both side statements regarding super hero movies from more grounded film.
I just embrace it at this point
people can disagree if they want there really is anything to base on the idea of what is art and cinema to someone as anyone can view anything as art even bland crap can be art to someone
@chandler burse  it can be  art  to them  but realistically speaking  when you observe the ways in which films were made then and the approach to making them  they were true art as opposed to the ones presented nowadays.
@mr.gamer 990  I guess but art is subjective as unfortunate as thatsometimes is especially considering some modern art pieces Ive seen.
@mr.gamer 990  a lot of people still put a lot of hours and hard work into marvel films no matter how much they suck. even terrible productions take a lot of work and heartache for employees to get through they do their best.
still haven t watched that movie either. what a knucklehead. reeee reeeee look at me! lol oh and happy belated birthday.
shung-chI was ant-man 2 caliber. not awful  but not a must see
I for one love simu liu s activism and how he speaks for the lgbtq community in china and the middle east through his collaboration with marvel. wait what  thats not him  I thought all non-whites are intergalactic ambassadors of human rights.
if he had a brain in his head he d ignore tarantino and go about his business.  collect his cheques and make his movies.
simu states that he was the first asian to represent. sorry I was watching bruce lee in the 60s and jackie chan in the 70s. shang chI was one of my favorite comics and simu is a solid martial artist but the story was all over the place like all the movies in phase 4
keep in mind this is thatsame actor thatsaid that pedophilia is no different than being gay and is just a sexual preference.
course simu would make it about race  good Lord. does know his casting as shang chI was disingenuous on the studios part  they was already going the woke route   needed to virtue signal so they went with him since he was already notably bitching about asian hollywood drama. my main issue with simu is that he acts like bruce lee   jackie chan weren t a thing that he actually is.
I became a fan of simu after binge watching kims convenience on netflix.  great show worth checking out.  was happy when he got the role as shang chI but unfortunately he went woke.  which is too bad  this was his big break and he blew it.
@1 10 - shang chI is good if you are asian  if not you ll probably feel like it doesnt relate to you
do a video on elon musk finding and showing off the ultra awesome  staywoke t-shits he found.
sure quentin tarantino movies aren t for everybody and thats okay but me personally I d rather re-watch all of quentin tarantino s movies over again than I would want to watch shang ch for a first time
the only franchise that matters is mission  impossible.
what tarantino said is accurate  and that they immediately pivot to  the message  nonsense proves that even the mcu isn t about the mcu anymore. he s right that the super hero is the star  not the actor  and the actors themselves should recognize that. that happens often with any book to movie adaptation. even toby mcguire was starring in films before spiderman but he s spiderman now  you just cant shake that. compare that with like a samuel jackson or a john travolta thatstarred in tarantino movies as characters and are known movie stars versus now tom holland who is spiderman and toby mcguire who is a minor character in the new movie as spiderman - easy recasts because the star is spiderman.
problem with joker  its almost a replica of a scorsese film  taxI driver.
wenwu was a better character in the movie and his story was the only one I cared about.
his name is pronounced  score-say-see .
martin scorsese has made some good movies  of which a handfull were box office hits  and some award winning. quentin tarantino has made some big action movies. but to be fair  their movies have predictable themes and tropes as well. you kind of know the sort of angle scorsese is going to take  from goodfellas to wolf of wall street to the irishman  because they re all narratives about certain crimes  the criminal mindset  and the evils of money. all of tarantino s movies are a bloodbath of violence with characters themselves that are at about a comic book style of development. while neither are a direct remake  you still have a pretty good idea how their stories are going to play out. its not to say their movies are necessarily bad  though I d prefer mel gibson s the passion of the Christ over scorsese s the last temptation of Christ. heck  even mel gibson s apocalypto  with all its violence  is more profound than anything tarantino has made. thatsaid  the critiques of actors and directors ought to be based primarily on their movies. yes  social and cultural stuff can come into play  and sometimes both actors and directors get type-casted to where the movies that are known or cared for  or not cared for  by the audience become the ones expected to be directed in a certain way by a director  or acted a certain way by an actor. mel gibson had it both ways with acting and directing. mad max and lethal weapon were franchises that began his climb to fame as an 80 s and 90 s big action blockbuster star. braveheart didn t quite change things  since it was still a role where gibson was known for his action in battle scenes. directing in passion  the expectation was the action  and it had similarities to mad max where it was more about the visual actions that moved the story forward. nonetheless  there was amazing acting  and passion arguably became the most well known subtitle film to have larger audience  whereas most highly acclaimed foreign films with subtitles often are relegated to film festival obscurity. so to me  someone like mel gibson is an example of an established actor that takes risks  and has broken the mold of expectations. this is what any actor that isn t happy with their type-casting should do  is take chances on other roles  try directing  or something other than complain about racism  gatekeeping  or lack of diversity.
please  help us talk about hasbro g.i. joe mtg d d. its a gold mine of this stuff   I would say even worse than disney. we need some help over here  d d went super woke with the new  d d one trailer    after looking it up in detail its all over hasbro. its probably the wokest franchise of them all  disney isn t even close to the mess that hasbro has made over at wizards of the coast. mtg is full of it as well.you will get a lot of views from the d d gaming community which is breaking up right now   for sure carve a new niche to talk about. again look up hasbro  in general  its in all of their franchises but d d is blowing up right now with people leaving due to drag queens showing up in the games now   just a full-on feminist takeover.would be great to get some bigger attention on the subject  everyone that has a d d channel is to afraid to speak up. anyways if you wanted something to talk about that does relate to everything you are talking about here habro d d is just filled with people to expose.
the way you pronounce the directors name is martin score say z
shang-chI was actually a decent movie in the phase 4 universe. everything else is subpar at best with witty jokes and poor fight choreographies.
I agree. while he s a solid martial artist  I think he should ve gone with his own fighting style instead of imitating post-hollywood jackie chan  which is a pretty toned down jackie chan.
@simu liu  - its not really a matter of endless love or support for you. its more about fairness  and that there are legitimate critiques when it comes to any actor or director. I barely know you as an actor  so there s not much yet to really give a fair critique. but there s still plenty of potential for you to have a successful career in film and entertainment as long as youre willing to focus on your goals and take chances. most of us as critics often remain on the sidelines because we may know a few things  but hadn t focused on our own stuff and  admittedly  are afraid to take the chances. or  as said  those who can do the work  do it  those that cant  teach. the critic  therefore  is a teacher   and their words to be taken with a grain of salt. anyways  I look forward to seeing what may be in storefor you in the future. and  Im from the usa.
@john crawford  you can hit on the profile icon with my picture to get more info from my channel description on how to share your opinion and thoughts....
@john crawford  well youre one of the more elaborate and constructive critics on this website. well you deserve a cookie... or a like...
simu liu-ser! haha  got  em!
the shang-chImovie was ok to watch once. but it was really bad compared to the source material. in the comics  shang-chI and the villain  the mandarin  were so much more. they have a great history and plenty of stories. heck  the mandarin was a big iron man villain. just watch the animated movie  the invincible iron-man . this was made before disney bought marvel.
just my opinion melonie but in my eyes you are as cool as lara. you may not be a bad ass tomb raider but youre a hero in your own way!
sumI lu didnt even got cameo in she hulk
shang chI wasn t too bad of a movie. sort of had a surf ninjas vibe to it. its not over the top or spectacular or anything but it wasn t the worst marvel film
score-seize  someone is busting a vein
as much as I loved shang chI  the actors have only made me less interested in seeing a sequel  if anything. and I watched that in theaters  seven times. I just want to go back to not giving a sh!t about celebrities. I watch films to be entertained  not subjected to popular idolatry. I ll never watch anything for some stranger Ive never met  who happens to have a career in acting.
consume next product. probably the disney motto.
jackie chan never needed to cry like a baby  like simu is doing. if he was a great actor  he would have space in other franchises.
Imean if I cared to a high degree I would but if an actor or director can be or do good movies then thats fine. as to what they say in their normal lives dont care. since we say alot in our normal lives. in other news water is wet
its really an amazing coincidence when someone s advocacy just so happens to align with their own demographic  or  conversely  their own shame for their own demographic .  now  sure  if youre in a minority group and there are advances to be made  then pushing for those advances is to be expected.  but so many people never really question the self-interest in their advocacy  which sets up a lot of preaching and bitching from a lack of self-awareness  which is really just a petty  childish  gimme  gimme  gimmick.  as for liu specifically  why would you think you can whinge and whine your way to being hired   oh yeah  because so many other victim cards are being played these days  but really  who wants to work with a sympathy hire   when you play a victim card  you tacitly acknowledge your own inadequacy and undeservedness to the world  even as you preach that its  gatekeepers  and  patriarchy  and  white men  that are turning a blind eye to genuine talent.  should minorities turn down opportunities to avoid playing a victim card   no.  look out for yourself  take the opportunities.  but the people actively trying to manipulate their way into  success  via identity politics are doomed to a lifetime of imposter syndrome.... because they re imposters.here s the thing  have people in positions of power historically overlooked talent in demographics that they did not respect  yes.  are all people in an overlooked demographic deserving of more  deserving of whatever they desire for themselves  no.  when you look at it at the zoomed out level  you can see the group-level phenomenon.  but when people try to take this phenomenon and fashion it into a victim card  they ve lost perspective.  they pretend and proclaim that its about the group sociocultural phenomenon  but its motivated by self-interest.  they cannot accept the possibility that they may not be individually deserving  even if  on the whole  their victim card demographic should be given more opportunities and recognition.
tarantino do care about racism  only different is that in his movie he doing with style  art and magic. unlikely marvel who literally call everyone racism for not liking a movie. I bet its a lot of people who does t like tarantino  but he know when you make a art you gonna hear every kind of response both good and bad and he except it  like any good artist would. but what marvel make is not art.
I cant believe you dont know how to say scorsese
I remember when simu liu was first promoting shang-chI and he seemed to be very humble and funny and really cool. I definitely enjoyed the movie and itseemed to be done well at the time. this criticism of tarantino and scorsese  skor- say-zee  is just sad and dumb to me. it does make you wonder if there is some kind of scouting going on with the woke folk club that pressures demographically appropriate candidates into membership. simu s comment was not only inaccurate but unnecessary which does make it pretty pathetic. feels like he just drank their kool-aid. playing the race card so liberally detracts from the real issues of racism thatshould be discussed and effectively addressed. its like the story of the boy who cried wolf. they keep saying this is racism  this is racism  but they re only making it worse by muddying the waters and convoluting the issue. over diversification is also a type racism. placing an actor in a role for only their asthetic at the expense of the story is extremely bigoted yet they are the ones accusing everyone else of racism. now thats rich.
simu liu can always get a job delivering chinese food. door dash  uber eats or maybe freelance.
Im still surprised melonie mac is this based. I thought she d end up being a super leftist like most in the entertainment industry but Im glad to be proven so wrong.
Imight ve developed I huge crush on melonie
tarantino and scorsese wouldn t cast simu in their movies because they only work with the best and he s far from it.
Im 1 2 asian  who is this dude  his mindset is because of that fact I should know who he is  nope!! I thought simu was little bro from lion king!!!
shangI chI is a low quality kung fu movie

how exactly would casting this guy empower anyone else than him  is he gonna share his salary with his buddies
how cantarantino a  racist gatekeeper ! literally the entire cast of the kill bill is one the most diverse your ever gonna see. whites  blacks  spanish  mixed  and french people. they all were a part of the cast.
in my opinion credentials are working on stage learning  your craft
our culture will be so much richer the day that we stop saying   hey  its all white dudes who are running things    Christian bale said.  whether that be hollywood  whether that be washington  you know. we re going to get  in hollywood  so much better films and so much more interesting stories being told and america will become the america that the rest of the world sees it as  that makes it unique that we recognize makes this such a beautiful  brilliant country.
love the channel and videos. his name is pronounced score-say-see...  for next time
he s basically saying that if studios were only run by competent people he never would have been hired.  he only got a role as a diversity hire.  thats nothing to brag about.
if anything  tarantino s jealous of the mcu s success  many people are  with this karen ytber included  which is why they are always trying to spinn the narrative of the marvel movies ruining cinema or really childish comments like demeaning  the actors work bc  apparently  becoming the character while on play  is synonymous to being a hack. Im a big fan of tarantino  but this is clearly a pr tactic to get more people to stop watching marvel movies in theaters to view their product instead. its all about business here  and honestly  this isn t a good look for tarantino. he low key  just revealed to the public that he would demean other people s  work  to boost his. that.  is sad.
simu liu more like simu who
shang chI was actually a luke warm movie backed by obnoxiousness. it had all the potential to be a memorable badass movie  but instead  it was total cliche driven by the most typical of hollywood tropes. honestly felt like a frankenstein s monster put together by various bits and bobs of previous marvel movies  chalked with poorly paced humor.
who tf is this  simpu  dude  never heard of him  but I watched several tarantino s movies  so talent speaks for both of them.
its crazy how tarantino wasn t insulting the actors  just observing the objective shift in the nature of the industry. I wanted to like shang chI but it was just a standard mcu movie and simu is pretty annoying  always focusing on race
while we argue about racism and sexism nobody question why are all of our medias in the hand of an handful of corporations. and nobody question why is an actor doing millions of dollars while amazon employees have to pee in a bottle or why people go bankrupt because of medical bills. homeless people are not important  no  what is really important is the color of the skin of a multImillions earning actor.
all I remember from that movie is awkwafina .
I liked the infinity saga  and a bunch of other comicbook inspired movies like logan  dark knight trilogy  blade  etc. but I get why scorecese thinks the way he does  and at first I found it a bit annoying  as I think comicbook movies can have the same artistic integrity as any of their movies with the right director behind the helm  as we ve seen with joker and nolans batman trilogy. but in the end its just their opinion and not a single moment goes by where I actually give a fuck about those opinions lol  ima just enjoy what I want.also  score-sees as you call him  is pronounced  score-say-sI   p
Im glad I have hard copies of my favorite ip s before they were destroyed by disney
I largely agree with you on most of your videos  but please  just make at least a cursory effort to learn how to pronounce names of famous directors youre going to read over and over again. scor-say-see - one of the best film makers of our time.
Ive heard that clown will actually refuse tosign 1970s era copies of marvels shang chImaster of kung fu at comic book conventions because they are allegedly racist !!imagine the arrogance of an actor .. who s only claim to fame will ever be the fact that he was chosen to play the character of shang chi.. telling a fan who might have waited on a line to get his comic book signed . only to told no!!also.. the fact that he believes that he had anything to do with the box office success of that movie.. when its obvious that the fans of the shang chI character would have gone to see that movie regardless of who the actor playing him was!lastly..I doubt very much thatscorcese   tarantino could give a f  that this nobody called them racist!!
if I had to choose my favorite movie of all time it would be kill bill volume 1
that funny calling tarantino a racist. lol. there are a lot worse things they could call him  but ask him if he cares. they cant do anything to him but talk. he doesnt bow to the big companies.
never apologise for talking about tomb raider
I looked up pronunciation and forgot when rolling the video. Imispronounce a ton of words  I just dont make a fuss over it because I d be pressed all the time if that were the case lol
@melonie mac go boom  no worries- Im not upset about it.  just a fan of scorsese  at least a lot of his stuff.
Christian bale has had enough of  white guys  running everything in hollywood and beyond. the actor stopped by aol build with his  hostiles  co-star rosamund pike and wes studI on december 18 and told the crowd that the reason he moved to the u.s. in the first place was because he wanted his kids to grow up in a  country of inclusion.  unfortunately  that ideal hasn t been too much of a reality.
infinity war and winter soldier are the only genuinely great marvel movies.
didn t even know his name til legit this video damn
disney star wars would have been so much better if fin was the mc.
subbed! youre close to 100k subs!
I absolutely agree with him  but you maybe missing scorsese s point  this is near all hollywood makes anymore. they dont much else outside of mcu like movies. and again you called joker a masterpiece  its alright but scorsese s taxI driver is still much better  which joker is almost a repurposing of taxI driver. if you ve never seen taxI driver 1976  watch it.
I think I will make a few people mad. I agree in general what scorsese and tarantino have said about the mcu. but  the mcu  dceu and other are a different kind of art coming from comic books. its not supposed to be understandable or not always understandable. its fantasy that goes over the human condition. tarantino  I dont have too much to say about him because of how be portrayed bruce lee in once upon a time...in hollywood and his explanation of why  which both were bs. I think simu liu may have been trying to ride in on that particular coat tail in regards to his post mcu career.simu liu s post mcu career. apparently he doesnt know history. simu s entertainment career has been a short one due to having come from the accounting world .simu being able to be a part of a major property like the mcu is more of an exception that the norm. to me  his acting background doesnt give him the experience to have played shang-chI  though he has the look. I agree with meloniethat are many asian actors who have the physical and acting experience to have played shang-chi. the problem is that they dont fit the age. the current asian actors of simu s age group  whether asian american or not  no. the only 2 asian actors in shang-chI who are actually really big international stars are michelle yeoh and tony leung chiu-wai. michelle yeoh is a little more well known in the west than tony leung by being a more western movies  but they are biggest starts. they have worked hard in their careers. I know michelle and tony  from their early hong kong martial arts   action movies in the 1980s and the 1990s up to their early 2000s west movies like tomorrow never dies  hero and crouching tiger  hidden dragon. they did not just action movies  but drama  comedy as well...much more well-rounded. compared to those 2  simu s acting career is really short in how long and what he has done. simu just got lucky. and when you get lucky  that doesnt mean movie and tv offers come flooding to your door. with that being said  I disagree with tarantino s opinion of there being no stars in any of the mcu movies. if that is the case  why does he have samuel l. jackson in his movies  samuel has been in some good non-tarantino movies  some of them definitely weren t blockbusters or even close  but they were good movies. brie larson  while I have my points of view about her  she does have an oscar for a drama she was in.robert downey  jr...he was nominated for playing charlie chaplin in the biopic chaplin-one of my favorite movies. chris evans  chris helmsworth  don cheadle  benedict cumberbatch mark ruffalo  scarlett johansson  etc have been in good movies and tv shows  ranging from blockbusters to not-blockbusters to dramas  comedies  etc. apparently tarantino hasn t done enough research about all of the actors and actresses in the mcu movies. oh  and if he were to develop and create his own marvel comic book character and make a himself of it...let s see how that works out.
12 40 - his name is pronounced score-say-zeehave you never heard anyone say his name
Im a huge chinese kung fu movie fan  a former marvel mcu fan  not any more  and Ive never had even the slightest urge to watch shang-chi. on the other hand  Ive enjoyed every single tarantino movie he s ever made  to varying degrees  and even the one s that he wrote but didn t direct. who the hell is simu liu  I see nothing notable on his imdb page except for one overhyped marvel movie thats trailer left me totally underwhelmed.
I hope he never gets another role  and that the role he had gets retired.
I literally have no idea who this guy is because I dont even bother with mcu movies  I quit watching them around  phase 2   because they ve been so formulaic that you could predict entire movie just from opening scene. the only movies I watched since phase 2 are ones where we go out in theaters and there s nothing else then mcu movie playing  which was sometimes often as I am not from usa  so we dont get every movie out there  only what theater owners presume would be most profitable  and occasionally we get some indI or obscure horror movie  because its literally  buy one mainstream movie  get two cheap horror movies for free .the fact that we got terrifier 2 in fully uncut version in theaters just shows you they have zero idea what they got  because literally no one bothered to check the movie before release  and let me tell you  terrifier 1 and 2 ain t disney movies.
you cant convince me when you watch a spider-man movie youre excited to see a tom holland movie lol. mostly everything he s been in has been trash movies lol. I expect him to play spider-man I dont expect him to play tom holland the impact legacy of his acting skills. quentin tarantino is not wrong though lol. we go to a marvel movie to watch the marvel character! also yes because of the actual actor playing that character. but when we go watch a marvel movie we watch it for the character mostly and the journey of that character.. not the actual legacy or impact of the actor behind the scenes!! when you watch chris evans or robert downey jr. we are going to see a captain america film or an iron man film!! not the other way around! rick dalton from once upon a time in hollywood was definitely a future meaning!! quentin tarantino knew what he was doing. rick dalton is having a hard time staying irreverent in hollywood. he doesnt want to do pasghettI westerns because they are bad! but his best friend cliff booth tells him its not the defeat of death of what youre thinking. its a job! and if you are not willing to do the movies to help you stay reverent in hollywood. then yes you will be a nobody!! marvel is what is hot in hollywood right now. nobody cares about the  actor itself anymore unless you are tied to a super successful business brand! a lot of marvel actors are staying in this franchise to stay alive in the business. cinema truly has changed!! Im tired of people disrespecting the old generation of directors acting like 30 years of experience went out the window for them. they saw cinema differently from their time. they have every right to criticize everything. simu liu has every right to be criticized right now. he basically said if it wasn t for marvel I would be a nobody in this business   and youre also implying these legendary directors would never see your value as an actor if it wasn t for marvel   dude stfu  somebody in the business would have recognized you eventually  marvel just helped you get there faster!!
the only thing simu lu is known for besides shang chI is kim s convenience  which from what Ive seen  is him making fun of other asians. go figure.the role of shang chI should have went to daniel wu. dude is memorizing to watch. check out into the badlands and thank me later.
star trek was ruined by time travel. the woke movement gave the people one fantastic gift. we know know which actors  and companies hate our very existence. this movement gave the customers all the information we needed to shut down their profits by talking them into making movies  then not showing up to watch them. praise their work in the public  let them spend their money  then shut them down. payback is a wonderful gift for the destruction of our childhood hero s.
bottoms up melonie said  tomb raider
I ll be honest  out of all the phase 4 crap Ive seen I enjoyed shang chI the most but hearing this whiny dumb dumb punching far above his weight seems so entitled for no reason whatsoever.if marvel burned to the ground I wouldn t even care anymore. their trajectory is going downwards fast  calling everyone racist for their own creative failures.
my  someone wants some clout  now  doesnt he  I think that quentin tarantino is horribly overrated  but the man has made some good movies and I can acknowledge that. I know that jackie chan ended up dissatisfied with hollyweird  to say the least  and went back to making movies in hong kong  but I seem to recall he didn t make near as big a fuss as mr  liu here is making about it    .  correct me if Im wrong  someone   I sense studio manufactured fake butt hurt in play  here.
holy s  ... just saw that there s gonna be a shang-chI 2. wtf!
Im usually with you but youre totally off here. before shang chI we barely saw asians as side characters let alone leads even though we love to hijack their culture and put a white face on it ie iron man 3 iron first and daredevil  kung lung outside of mulan I cant think of an asian person let alone an asian man as anything but a sidekick. he s not wrong here.also listing kill bill is exactly what he s talking about. let s use asian culture without promoting positive asian protagonists.
shang chI was mid at best melonie.
thank you! I am so stoked!  d
good choice. its horrible. just feels lame. poor plot. really annoying characters. some of the cgI is really really bad.
and he does thatstuff often. the guy is so insecure  it is embarrassing at this point
@revan 1313  I never even heard of the guy before the movie. he needs to take a chill pill and drink a tea for his nerves.
@revan 1313  he probably needs to be relevant desperately or something.
@max  I think you are right. he is extremely insecure and itshows. Imean... having the balls to indirectly insult tarantino and scorsese as racists    the guy is out of his mind. maybe he hates italians lol. jokes aside. he is so full of himself and I am surprised how no other actor called hin out
funny that tarantino says all this crap  but he obsesses over stuff like grindhouse   blaxploitation films like any real major stars came from any of those movies   they were pushing those crap movies out in a crazy rate just like marvel! !  not to mention  the amount of stuff tarantino has lifted from  obscure  movies   put into his own like it was his own is hilarious. finally  he was also going to make a luke cage  of course  film back in the day   he wanted laurence fishburne for the role. basically  tarantino has become as obnoxious as one note gangster flick making scorsese himself.
I have seen a lot of martin scorsese and quentin tarantino movies and given their body of work I have to respectfully disagree with his assessment. it is clear to me his knowledge of their work is lacking. martin scorsese directed a movie called kundun  a really good biographical film about tenzin gyatso  the 14th dalaI lama. I enjoyed it anyway. I will just leave you with this little quote. by a guy named barry norman a british film critic that I found interesting. for context he was writing about an interview with martin scorsese.  yet itseems to be scorsese  rather than the studio  who is doing most to promote the film. so I asked him  did disney back you up when it came out  did they really put themselves behind it to try to sell it   now scorsese is a decent and diplomatic man  who likes to be fair to everybody  but eventually he said   I personally think that  unfortunately  they didn t push the picture.  for fear of offending china   who knows   he said. but  perhaps significantly  he also said   the market china represents is enormous  not just for disney but many other corporations around the world.
scorsese is pronounced skor-say-see.
shang-chI is probably the best mcu phase 4 movie  although its not saying much. black widow came out 5 years too late. eternals were shit. no way home wasn t bad  but did nothing for me. multiverse of madness was decent. love and thunder was bad. wakanda forever was nothing  I only liked namor when he yelled  imperius rex . shang-chI was a good movie with a weak third act.
simu might be the most entitled fake victim in hollywood right now.
even some people who like that crappy marvel movie shang-chI and the legend of the ten rings dislike simu liu. simu liu wasn t even a good casting for shang-chi. he could barely emote. he has the charisma of a cardboard shoebox. plus  I really hate that they included the mandarin in that movie instead of in a potential iron man 4 before killing off tony stark. the mandarin is iron man s arch enemy  not shang-chI s! he is not even in shang-chI s rogues gallery! they ruined the mandarin in that movie! they made his ten rings arm bracelets which looked lame af! he is not supposed to be shang-chI s dad! fu manchu is shang-chI s dad! also the mandarin s real name is never supposed to be revealed. the mandarin is supposed to be a mysterious supervillain. the mandarin to iron man is what the joker is to batman. marvel ruined the mystique of the mandarin and forgot what made him such a cool supervillain.
people thinking  popcorn  type movies cannot be cinema or anything more that cheap entertainment... id wager star wars a new hope has had more significance and impact to peoples lives than any by scorsese or tarentino. especially for example  to a parent and child sitting down to watch it  for the childs first time.
Im celtic and they keep taking away my heroes like a lotso much so that Ive given up on themIm going to make my own comics
as much as I liked shang-chI  I have to call bullshit on simu s take. its just bad  dude. as far as Im concerned  there aren t any gatekeepers in cinema. it just comes across as you throwing shade at two directors for no real reason.
I want movie makers to create original content. I haven t been to see a movie in years.
scorsese is the greatest director by a country mile. not just for me  but for most. but I disagree  comic books can be artistic  thematic and profound. the batman for example is a masterpiece. phenomenal film thats extremely artistic in its presentation and how itshows human nature.
marvell s first woke film was in the phase 3  captain marvell  they made the  3 captain marvell the main character. also they gender swapped mar vell who was a man into woman. then made the second captain marvell into a little girl  which she was close to carol danvers age in the first place. at the end of end game they lined up all the female characters for a special shot at the end of the movie. thus the m- she -u was born. all of phase 4 has been absolute trash without merit. when you hire people for their politics this is what you get. simu is a joke and the bad thing is he doesnt see it because he is a narcissists. in his mind he is the greatest thing in the movies. thank you melonie for your take on this subject. melonie  martin scorsese pronounces his name skor-say-zee. Im only mentioning this because I would want to be told the correct pronunciation of his name.
she-dunk glowing
honestly   tarantino s just pissy that he doesnt produce movies that make as much money.
scorsese
mel. baby. scorsese. score-say-see. thats how you say it. I get the confusion  but youre killin  me here.
simu is merely defending this paychecks
also  its score-say-zee lol
shang chI was painful to watch... I didn t get to the end
same energy as george takei.
uh... I doubt that
his movies will be remembered long after the mcu is a footnote in cinematic history.
loooooooooooooooooooooool
dude  that makes absolutely no sense. tarantino has been making movies for thirty years now. he s a legend. no way he s gonna get pissy about a nobody.
dont go see the movie.  let the studios die
ok say it with me now  score-say-sea
when showing tweets on screen  please hold ctrl   mouse wheel up. sincerely  my eyes.
score seas   yes. that is the correct pronunciation. carry on.
I agree with simu liu
Im glad Im a little bit older because I did not enjoy most of them I watched some and its pretty good but Im not going to lie I prefer fox x-men  and I know its not in line with the comics  even with the good and the bad I still prefer that era
simu liu. sounds like a kaminoan name
almost to 100k congrats
Imissed the all white version of silence scorsese made.
hey melonie  in case you care  its pronounced score say zee and posited is poz-it-ed.
sitting here  and youtube tells me there is kung pow enter the fist is free with ads.it  too  is a love letter to asian cinema.  I haven t watched his film.  but Im gonna go watch kung pow.
these people run entirely on envy and ego.
I confess. I click the videos but im hypnosed by the hair. thats 2hour grooming day come on
just for you mac boom score-say-see
melonie I love your hair !
wasn t he the same man who said there was never an asian superhero  seriously  has he forgotten any asian action movie from the 70 s to the 2000 s
Im sorry I know its not a huge deal but they way you say his name is  score-say-zee
seemoo loo  what a damn shame. how could he lack so much self awareness  and shang chI was okay  wouldn t watch it again though.
I dont think he has any idea who tarantino is.
score say zee. lol u got this
score-say-zee lol
@13 55 I want to see quentin terrantino do that !!!!!!
scorsese is pronounced score-say-zee
score-say-see lol
he sounds like an asian john leguizamo.
love melonie s take here  but could someone please teach her how to say scorsese.
score-say-zee !    d
hey remember me  I was the guy you ve never heard of from the marvel kung fu movie.
score-say-cee not score-seas
its pronounced score-say-zee
scorsese   score-sez-ee
I think they pronounce itskor seI see. or something.  I could be wrong.
didn t pay for shang chi. didn t watch shang chi. wont watch shang chi.
ree look at me! like when he lashed out at the youtubers.
smuI luI calling quentin tarantino a racist yet qt had samuel l jackson  a black man  on more in his movies than any other actors.
you must be in your 20 s or not in the know on pop culture  the director s name is pronounced score say si. welcome.
I didn t even know who this dude was  oh well
oh melanie lolscore-say-see
algorithm bump
actually liked shang chI as a movie but not getting that mcu feel
seriously  how can someone not know how to pronounce scorsese
sound it out lol score say see
the mcu is michael bay.
disney should shut off simu twitter he is digging his grave lol also ironic he is driding disney so much while they now got a deal with china for avatar release
what annoys the tar out of me about all theses actors of different races  is that they all ignore all the actors before them that made movies and were stars.  like jackie chan and jet li.  they both successfully led movies as asians and are well loved by their fans that come from all races.  and how about sidney poitier  he was the first black actor to win an oscar and that was all the way back in 1964.  but all these actors today talk like none of those movies or actors ever existed before them.  its extremely disrespectful  and makes these crybabies look like the fools they are.
truth
Im not in th business of being a simp  shil or slave- the great quintin terrentino
happy late birthday!
hello melonie and how your day going and have you thought about live streaming on twitch again and starting your own podcast and starting your own vlog channel on youtube and starting your own tiktok account and starting your own patreon account or onlyfans account in the future
I had the same take on this guy. a nobody fighting for relevance.
he was better on kim s convenience
and op-ed is pronounced awwwp-ed.
neither one of those directors want the strings that come with a 400 million dollar budget so this is a non starter
he thinks he is the only asian to headline an action  movie. look at bruce lee and jackie chans resumes  what idiots! they made snake  eyes  an asian...even though he s not. and I love hbomax s warrior  I think  they saved it from starz  that has tons of asian actors in it. the main guy andrew kojI should have been shang-chi. kojI is a much better actor and has great charisma
its pronounced  squirrel-says
Im sure everyone will point this point  but anthony mackie said the same thing. the only difference is tarantino is white  so its bad we he says it.no one went for simu  they went because it was marvel s shang chi
say his name score - say - ce with italian flare
score says e
scor - say - ze      sk  r s sI  skor-sess-ee    italian  skor se ze
simu is in falun gong cult
happy thanksgiving go boom
scorsese   score-say-zee
wish I had the  oppressed     racist  cards to pull to explain away my inadequacies  bad luck   entitlement ..  I just have to work hard  get up when knocked-down   dust myself off    keep going-fot-it.
it always goes back to tomb raider...
score sees lol
score-say-zee
let s just say he is a supporter of maps. so simu cantake his cartographic appreciation and other garbage views and screw off. one day he ll be dragged for this stuff.
excuse me  it was 7 minutes.
score-say-z
skor-say-see
why every time he opens his mouth he says something stupid that equates to I dont like my job and its the audience s fault
who tf is simu
skip shang-chI and watch netflix s daredevil instead.
gotta love the woke simu cry  racism  when these two directors dont have any interest in directing superhero movies.
thanks!
he s bragging about a movie that lost money
glad I didn t spend money on shang-chI lol  I love how shI acts as if every past comic movie have only been  white people  simu is an idiot  probably pissed he didn t get cast as liu kang in mk lol attacking tarantino for stating the truth and is known for casting minorities in his films....
yeah I skipped his movie
score-say-zee not score-sees.
honestly hes only famous for complaining and not shang chi. shang chI is the prime example of decent mcu movies. its watchable but nothing spectacular. any coverage on him is more about his twitter than his role. if he actually knew anything about hollywood  hed know tarantino loves the silver age. thats the late 60s and early 70s. those films were diverse in many ways.
good vid siski
ahh thank youuu
real question  which kill bill is better !
simu liu            ........who know this guy........we all know who tarantino is......
my word are these actors ignorant.
simu liu looks like pooh bear ruler of the ccp.
shang chI was the last good marvel movie   he s just butthurt cause people are biting the hand that feeds him
simu was great in kim s convenience. I haven t really liked anything else he s been in.
who is this simu liu no name guy
the joker  the dark knight  logan  blade  and infinity wars will stand the test of time the others idk
shang chI was a great character when he was modelled after bruce lee. as soon as they gave him  powers   they ruined the character. missed opportunity by mcu  could have ushered in a new era of martial arts films.
simu....who
martin  score-say-zee   mamaz
skor-say-zee
no  kim s convenience is far more popular than shang chi.
I see nothing special about simu. that marvel role really made him a big shot guy. nobody knows him before. he should be humble. not many people can be in his position right now
that dude in the thumbnal  who is that  a young angry xijinping
we get it none of those movies are sunrise but in the right hands they can be nobody really wants to make a  200 million dollar art film well they have Imean look at 2049 but I didn t go so well in terms of box office hollywood was built by the j s on the surface level to make money.
the movies he makes give house hold names. or deals with those types of actors.example it will go down like this omg its keanu reeves!not  hey its neo from the matrix!most marvel actors  I bet are called out by thier character names. examplelook its the guy who played the hulk.marvel actors do play characters in a sense. and quinn makes movies of everyday life. it could be a story about a neighbor down the street. real life movies in a sense.marvel after all is based of comic book fantasy world. even if its live action resembling  modern times . thatshit will never happen in real life.where quinn s movies are about the daily life and struggle some everyday normal people may have. one of my  favorite movies is gran torino with clint eastwood.
kimchI liu
simu liu is mad thatsounds like a him problem and its 1 we dont care about
you want to know what both funny and sad quinten can barely make a better mcu movie that would actually make people want to watch it
part 1 is the best!
@melonie mac go boom  I have to agree. the second one is far more ambitious and goofy  but I still really like it. the first movie is tighter and more competent.
explain
@philI the gamer  explain what  how he seemed to work well with the rest of the cast in that one show  Ive got nothing more to explain.
okokokokok I am so glad someone picked this upnow  there is this show on thec.w. calledkung fu.now  I have seen shangchI and...the kungfu show is betterer. there is more heart. betterer fighting. the protagonist is better. family talk.now  cw sucks but. their shows are top notch
simu liu... marvel studios didn t create the role for you marvel comics did back in 1973.
who is score seize
ching chong s small ding dong makes him mad
the movie is ok but he seems to be on coke.
phase 4 has been up and down. shang-chI was one of the best and thor 4 one of the worst
you cant even read the tweet right and you haven t seen his movie but youre going to provide an opinion  lol
score say zee.
10 bracelets actor throws tantrum that other actors are more talented than him. way to show your true colors..lost respect greatly for this person. I thought shang chI was entertaining and he did a good job but these days..its all stunt doubles and cgi.
original thor was really good.
he s just attention seeking. ignore him and he will fade into obscurity.
happy birthday 2 days late
gotta sayas a long time comic book fannothanos sucked in infinity warhes plan to kill half the universe was stupidthe lady death angle is vastly superiorbut the russo bros fucked it upjust my opinionlove ur vids
marvel cinematic universe ended with endgame.  after that  most marvel movies done by disney weren t that great.  that and the burnout.  they need to slow down .but I doubt it.
white powah
remember when this guy said  pedophillia is no different than being gay.
just watch big trouble in little china instead
when everyone is racist  no one is racist.  - some fortune cookie  probably
simu who
does he realize he was the worst part of his own movie
woke people dont care about kids tho so he gets away with it
@melonie mac go boom  well they care so long as they can use them as propaganda pieces
did he really say that
tarentino got a bunch of honk kong action movies theatrical releases in the states... iron monkey among them. he did more just n the 90s for chinese cinema and movies in general in the 90s than simu can ever dream oft accomplishing.  stfu simu!!!
tarantino  the guy who hired samuel jackson  pam grier  lucy liu  jamie foxx  ving rhames and the like in central roles in his films  yeah  I definitely had that guy pegged as a racist.

when actors come out and say non sense like this it makes me regret having spent money on their movie. I didn t like shang chi. I thought the acting was awful and the writing was terrible but the hype got me to buy it and watch it and at worst I was just disappointed. now I add regret to the list.
simu liu is the goat. y all hating
score-say-see
tomb raider! I get it! would be nice if you didnt turn everything to it! not what I subscribed for!
there ll probably never be a shang chI 2. the first one was banned in china because of him and getting that chinese money was the only reason the movie was made.
its martin scor-say-zee
simu who
sorry melonie but its pronounced score-say-see.
isn t he the guy that china said was too ugly to be chinese
he became useless to hollywood when the ccp lost their favor
its pronounced -score say see
liu who
quintin tarantino  irrelevant  says some block that nobody knew before his marvel movie  small pee pee energy right there
what s funnier is that the chinese netizens thought he was too ugly to be shown in the theatres.
@simu liu  reported
oh noooo
movie is alrite  but too chinese for my taste. well at least its not m-she-u.
more like simu who
simu obviously doesnt understand nuance. melonie  u should watch the movies that u critic
I hated kill bill.
so let me get this straight you called quentin tarantino racist when one of his movies is about killing nazis and the other movie is about slave rescuing his wife from slave traders thats clearly racism right there
simu whu
what else has simu liu been in nothing of note.if I want to watch a movie with karate jujitsu or something I ll watch jackie chan old bruce lee films donnie yen or jet lI or jason statham thank you very much.at least they dont look like some puppy yourescued from a puddle.
quentin tarantino part of the marvel-isation of hollywood is   you have all these actors who have become famous playing these characters but they re not movie stars. right  captain america is the star. or thor is the star. Imean  Im not the first person to say that. I think thats been said a zillion times but its like  you know  its these franchise characters that become a star. Im not even putting them down frankly  to tell you the truth. but that is one of the   the legacy of the marvel-ization of hollywood movies. look  I used to collect marvel comics like crazy when I was a kid.there s an aspect that if these movies were coming out when I was in my twenties  I would totally be f-ing happy and totally love them. Imean  they wouldn t be the only movies being made. they would be those movies amongst other movies. but  you know  Im almost 60  so yeah. no  Im not quite as excited about them. _tarantino isn t really wrong just like scorsese wasn t a few years ago. his best statement was saying how he hates the state of hollywood. we re living in the worst era of films since the 1950s. Im fine with mcu and all these superhero movies but this genre cant be the only one hollywood keeps making. and many of my favorite mcu films dont rank even my top 20. I find them extremely hollow. have you seen the leak for mcu phase 5 through 7  none of it excites me. another spider-man  the marvels  the thunderbolts  you can say its superhero fatigue. look at andor. people who seen it are praising but very few saw it. the finale has zero hype. people are getting tired of disney. and things aren t looking up if they brought back iger. poor simu getting criticized for responding though.at least kathleen is being put in pasture by next year. she needs to retire. people are tired of all this woke crap and cookie-cutter m-she-u crap. and she-hulk writers leftists are said to be trolling their fans. more like running out of cool ideas.Im only mentioning tarantino today because it actually applies to game of thrones and house of the dragon as well. the actors aren t really the stars. its the character themselves thats the star. daemon and rhaenyra were already popular before hot d aired.tarantino s best movieI think pulp fiction is tarantino s best movie  and most popular  but once upon a time in hollywood is my favorite movie. when I first saw it back in july 2019  I was disappointed in it. there was the controversial bruce lee scene and real-life event that was altered. then I subbed to regal unlimited and watched it like 6 more times in the theater. I came to love it. its tarantino s best  hangout  film. love the scenery and music in it. I admired how much work they had to make it look like an authentic 1969. I thought leo deserved an oscar like brad did. its not perfect. didn t care about cliff beating the crap out of the katie or rick roasting sadie.sadie   f--k you  katie! sorry I dont know the name of every fascist on tv in the 50s.  you can see maya hawke smiling and nearly breaking out of character with the way mikey madison delivered that line.cliff   high on acid  you are real  right tex   Im as real as a donut  motherf    r.next to the big lebowskI  ouatih is my most listened movie ever. and I didn t think it would being its not the most talky tarantino film. it deals more with visuals. but no  its one of the easiest to listen to next to the big lebowskI and dazed and confused thanks to the awesome soundtrack.I would only rank once upon a time in hollywood maybe tarantino s 5th best. pulp  django  and basterds are superior to it. perhaps even reservoir dogs. but it became my favorite over time. neither kill bill films ever clicked with me although some sequences were quite stunning.trust me  I have all tarantino films on my phone and ouatih is the one I kept going back to. second is surprisingly the hateful eight. thats very talky. I used to have that play every night before going to sleep. the most visually pleasing is django. but the last part with the tupac song turns me off watching a  western . once upon a time in hollywood is tarantino s most expensive film. he finally got to see his vision onto a film while his older films in the 1990s didn t have the level of budget to express everything in his mind. its also his least violent film with only the last 15 minutes being violent.what makes ouatih so enduring and so replayable to me is I think its a tarantino film with the most heart. rick and cliff really did care about each other and supported each other when both were having a rough time. its actually a really sweet bromance hangout film at its core.if you want to be transported back to hollywood back in 1969 in how tarantino envisions it  watch this film. to save sharon tate at the end was genius as you see the words  once upon a time...  a reminder that this is tarantino s fairytale ending he wanted to see happen...best tarantino films 1. pulp fiction 2. django unchained 3. inglourious basterds 4. reservoir dogs5. once upon a time... in hollywood 6. the hateful eight 7. kill bill  qt counts this as one film 8. jackie brown 9. death proof my favorite tarantino films1. once upon a time... in hollywood 2. pulp fiction 3. django unchained 4. inglourious basterds 5. the hateful eight 6. reservoir dogs7. kill bill  I prefer vol. 2 8. jackie brown 9. death proofa lot of people like jackie brown but I never got into it. I didn t hate it but I never seemed to care for it. its actually a book adaptation. so it doesnt have tarantino s writing flair in it. death proof is regarded tarantino s worst film and he s stated its his worst. if I can include true romance  it would probably rank 4th best and my 3rd favorite behind pulp. the sicilian scene is one of the greatest dialogue in film history. drexl spivey  gary oldman  is one of my favorite movie characters ever. floyd  brad pitt  was also great. true romance is one of margot robbie s favorite movies.
simu whosawhatsis
if you cant get your way or lost relevance. scream racism or sexism.
we have salty taco  and he s a pot stickah  the real racists are those who always bring the issue up.
I hope they make shang-chI two lol
simu liu recategorizes himself from ok actor in an average-ish film to an annoyingly privileged victim.
shang brie
shang ch!t
shang chI was actually a good movie. they couldn t get away with woke on this one  china no no to woke woke.
dont waiste your time watching shanshI   its not worth the time.
below average actor attacks one of the greatest directors of all time. dying for spotlight.
scorsese is not a racist. did a very good in green dragons revenge.  about new york asian street gangs. didn t like departed due to an idea he took from asian cinema.  which was called infernal affair. tarantino is another story.
its like he s been brainwashed by marvel by completely disregarding the actual criticism and pivoting to  marvel is super diverse!  like...idk its ridiculous but in the same breath could we avoid buzz words like  woke  a lil bit  in my experience people that use certain terms dont have the most sensibility in what they say but its conflicting cause you say real shit but use the language of some lunatics
he should be crying his ass since disney now got a avatar release in china
he was a nobody he is this netflix show called slasher I think season 2 for like 2 minutes lol
ah yes the foot fetish legend himself
hImelonie mac would you rather play detroit become human over watching marvel phase 4
so  he cant get roles because everyone is racist  except for disney  so  jackie chan  ip man  and bruce lee just fell off the earth
phase 4 has been pretty bad. highlight was probably spiderman no way home
I know simu was in fresh off the boat sometime ago  how much of a bet do you want thatshow was a huge flop!
simu liu only got his job due to identity politics  and I say that as an asian person. there have been so many better asian action actors like bruce lee  jackie chan  jet lI  donnie yen  tony jaa  iko uwais  etc.
I like some of tarantino s movies  but I dont like him. if tarantino had an original idea it would die of loneliness. how he made bruce lee look like a dufus in  once upon a time in hollywood  is unforgivable!
how
unfortunately shang chI is the only two hood mcu movies post endgame 0r 2019
when it comes to representing diversity these billionaire producers are missing the mark by light years.
the guy starred in one movie where he played a character derived from bruce lee.  now he thinks he s on bruce s level.  people like bruce  chow yun fat  jet lI  jackie chan  donnie yen  I could go all day  are Goddamn superstars with a list of credits a mile long.  his supporting cast included michelle yeoh and tony leung. he wasn t even the biggest star in his own movie!simu stands on the shoulders of giants and thinks he climbed there himself  like he had anything to do with the money that movie made and not the name marvel.
I think his name is pronounced score say see
martin score-say-zee.. say it quickly.  scoresayzee...  -
honestly  he didn t stand out in the film.
boom......
I guess I was just hallucinating when I saw a black man lead the cast of independence day in 1996. because before woke world its obvious that no black person was ever allowed to be a huge film star or anything. you were just imagining it.
she sound like she spews hate
semen loog
what a clown simu liu is
youre kinder to him than the chinese were.
@simu liu  lol
who the fuck is shamu liu
Im sorry simu  I cant hear you over how irrelevant you are outside of shang chi. even your character s sister outclassed you in your own movie!
it felt like a typical xianxia chinese move but lower quality compared to some chinese movies.
maybe hire the best people instead of hiring based on woke ideas.
at this point Im beginning to think they race  and gender swapped brie larson.
his point is irrelevant cause if they made shang chI with a white guy...ofc nobody would fw it there would obviously be a problem
on behalf of us asian canadians  even we think he s a talentless hoser.
he def targeted the wrong guy lol. but there are some things like non whites had to work slightly harder to get roles amd the whole trope that blacks always die first in horror movies. but tarantino was def the wrong guy to target lol
personally I didn t really like shang chi.. boring af imo. I actually liked eternals more and that was mid af. I really dread the future avengers lineup... smh
sea moo who
nobody in china fights for less chinese in chinese cinema.  why is he not calling for mor europeans to lead asian stories
simu liu sucks  he s in one movie with tony leung and he expects bruce lee status...
for a racist  quentin tarantino hired quite alot of asians in his kill bill films. also  apparently pulp fiction doesnt exist.feeling embarassed as a chinese canadian from the gta right now. simu liu really needs to kerp his mouth shut.
bruce lee   jackie chan were better actors!
he has a nerve as his parents came from one of the most racist countries going.
kill bill wasn t all that great just sayin
simu lanjiao is a literal diversity hire. and marvel isn t peak cinema. nothing ground breaking was done. nothing new was being created.james cameron did something visually amazing with avatar.sam mendes made single long shots mesmerising with 1917.wachowskis combine a few genres together with the matrix.jackie chan and his stunt team did something never seen before in action stunts for his movies  literally 90  of his entire filmology .akira kurosawa s films have been inspiration for western film   video game directors for cinematography  script writing and even outright remakes even until today.
to be fair scorcese rarely hires minorities. he is wrong about tarantino though.
dont watch it. pure torture. the only good fight scene  bus scene  constantly gets interrupted by crappy jokes. also  Im getting sick of the mcu shills making itsound like its some kind of revolutionary thing to see martial arts in a movie.
how much diversity in china  india  middle east  qatar  saudI arabia etc
if youre not getting any work  then that means youre not a very good actor  mr. simu.
the legend of the ten ring is a good movie waaaay better than scarlett or eternals you should watch it.
babe  you gotta learn to pronounce names and words. youre a professional at this now. seriously.
shang chI was probably a 7 out of 10. it was a pretty movie with really forgetable  and annoying side characters. ive had no desire to go and watch it again. so maybe its a 6 lol
honestly martin scorsese s opinions are rubbish. cinema literally means a theater where movies are showing for public entertainment or the production of movies as an art or industry. I dont agree with the shang-chI actor or martin scorsese statement.
Imean I at least tarantino s movies are remember after years I barely cared about shang chI since it was another generic marvel movie
simu liu probably hasn t heard of opinions. if he only knew  he wouldn t be as salty as a filipino sun-dried fish like this.
chang chI   master of kung fu was based off bruce lee. do yourself a favor  spare yourself the disappointment amd watch something else.
shaun chI and the ten bracelets is a full on skip. the  comedy  is absent. awkwafina was a drag. 3rd act was the most watchable part  and other people told me that was the worst part for them  so its subjective. d-
idk if youremember qt telling people who have a problem with him say n   er in his films to go watch something else  well maybe he needs to follow his own advice instead of complaining about superhero films like scorsese did. you notice how no one in these hero films are complaining at all  except two old caucasian farts. even sam jackson had to clap back  which Im sure you did or didn t mention   cause I didn t even watch the whole video since you want to start attacking people from the start for standing up to people or complain. quentin and martin are the two old farts in the muppet show  lol.
Im a bit torn on his comments.yes hollywood was white as hell for a long time.but at the end of the day I dont care about race neither did tarantinos comments had anything to do with race.
youreally gonna talk smack about an actor and movie that you admit you know nothing about
shung jI is... a hijacked movie where the so called  hero  is supplanted midway or sooner by his sister  who had none of his training  yet simply is.. a martial arts master of masters... boom... no backstory  no history  no accomplishments.. since she was conceived  apparently she was already a jedI samuraI kong too wong foo master...so yea... on thatscore.. itsux...
as an asian guy  I find simu liu insufferable.
while I enjoyed shang chI  I dont approve of the shitsimu liu is pulling
ok time out  time out  stop  although I probably agree with you  shangchI sucked   you cant make an opinion piece type video critiquing a guy whom you ve never seen in a single movie. you haven t even seen shang chI  the movie he is famous for  I almost let you slide because you are hot  but no. go watch shangchI and then come back and make your video..
thor love n thunder was not a good movie imo
fail
epic fail! just read the comic book instead.
it was a by the books copy and paste marvel movie.
its shangshit  my mcu ended at infinity wars  and then died with stark.
but the movie  joker  has shown that you can make an  art -movie out of a supervillain character. so... if you have a real good screen writer and director it would have been possible with lara croft too  but you have to have real talent there to do it and they simply haven t for the new lara... so its now simply a boring and overdramatic superficial shitshow.
also  tarantino literally got these talking points from anthony mackie  the black guy who plays faclon. who has the exact same opinions  so how the fuck is tarantino racist here
did he also attack china for never having a black protagonist  I haven t seen much diversity from bollywood  he should get on that too.
hey melonie  again  we are in 2022  people just stop calling everybody racist sure still some people are but not the whole world and stop pointing finger to fans  when they hate a show.
Christian bale says hollywood  and the world  would be better if  white dudes  weren t in charge of everything the actor says there would be  so much better films and so much more interesting stories  if white dudes weren t running hollywood. zack sharf dec 19  2017
phase 4 was trash aside from loki
I thought shang chI was very cool with the asian culture and dragons.  what a shame the actor himself is a cry baby.. mcu with all that woke now. I found the asian culture very interesting.
I said it 20 years ago. when they have no win in an argument your racist.
let those old men cry. not saying all the comic movies are good. these are just old dudes mad they are on the bench.
this guy simu liu thinks he s like one of the best actors and that his character is so interesting  but actually he s so bad and his character is boring af
I dont like the fact that the joker movie is held up as some  masterpiece its not. for the most part it copied and remixed scorsese movies  and conned people into watching it by slapping the joker name on it  and had their main actor wear face paint...the film is pretty decent on the whole but its not a movie about the joker. this is my problem with it.
the movie not good at all.
tarantino is racist  his movies show that racism is bad................ has he ever even seen a tarantino movie
the golden age of hollywood was white as hell ......the golden age of bollywood was indian as hell....the golden age of hong kong movies was asian as hell.....my point... why would an industry located in a predeominantly white country cast anything other than predominantly white actors. why would an industry located in a predominantly indian country cast anyone other than indian actors. why would an industry located in eastern china cast anything other than predominantly chinese actors.this isn t racism  its simply that all industries are a reflection of the ethnic state of their surroundings. as globalization increases I would expect to see more and more diverse casting in every countries localized industries. the golden age of hollywood was white as hell ...... is like complaining that a lot of british tv shows and movies dont have a lot of mexicans in them  why the hell would they .
dude  if you want to speak out against racism  talk about harvard admissions discriminating against asian applicants.
so extremely average actor thatstarred in one below average mcu movie is now acting like he has 20 years of blockbusters.
this is the only video Im gonna disagree with. tarantino is a known sleezeball creep.
come to think of it   best phase 4 movie is spiderman no way home.. where main protags are.3 white guys2 main white villians1 supporting white guy1 supporting asian guy______________ its simple really coz spiderman except miles morales   is white   how it was portrayed in comic ! u can say cat-shit or mongoose-shit. but nothing can replace saying bullshit .   coz its original
I get the guy who is defending the company that gave him fame and a good job. but saying disney pushes diversity lol... as easy as disney pushes forced diversity they make it all vanish when they present their content to the chinese and mediterrean market. hipocrisy all around. samuel jackson has been praising tarantino s diversity in his movies since forever  I guess he could have been nicer  to sound less gatekeepish but we cant have everything I guess
I can understand a perv  but racist
another reason why diversity is not a strength.
its an ok...perfectly forgettable movie. if I d catch it on cable I d still continue searching for something to watch  if I saw the thumbnail in a streaming service....I d still look for something better to watch. his performance is ok. he just has a forgettable face...nothing really stands out about him. nothing really stood out about the movie either.
lu who  never heard of her....seriously maybe this movie sucked and this acting sucked as well.
lol ccp drones talking as if anyone besides other ccp drones is taking them seriously isfunny
shang shI is boring movie anyway
shang-chI was boring
it was an average at best movie  dont bother
infinity war is like all the part 1 going on part 2 finale bullshit along with empire strike back. its hardly original.  the dark knight did it kill bill vol 1 to an extent harry potter and the deathly hallows part 1 its just the bad guy winning.
thor movie the first one was great.. the rest of the thor movies were complete and utter crap that money should have been given to someone else it ruined the mcu for me
dont watch it mel it was bloody awful  full of asian stereo types which was hilarious  made no sense whatsoever like the guys father sends assassins to go get him who try and kill him and he is like I knew they wouldn t succeed  the abomination is in it as a joke  its just plain crap
aww the soy boy is big mad boohoo let him be mad dude will never make money from the every day person
its a bad movie
has simo liu not heard of django unchained   why is it that a no name nothing like liu has a platform to his betters racist
no one likes  spider boy  the mcu spidey is not great.
shang chI suuucks
shang-chI was awful. kim s convenience was excruciatingly bad. he s a lousy actor who would not have a career in a normal entertainment industry.
shang chI was boring dont waste your time on it
just focus on collecting ring man  new mcu movies and series are garbage  end game is the end.
the second movie was probably the closest he was in the comics but everyone hated it  go figure.
no one cares what simu liu thinks!  he was a mediocre character in a mediocre movie and his mediocre career is over.
another failure of  forced inclusion and diversity the list is long. and the move is total meh. forgettable.
it was lazyand may I add not interested because I grew up with dragon ball woke copies bore me very much
an annoying youtuber streaming a reading session  repeating written words from articles and slamming simu liu for slamming tarantino. hilarious
the shang chImovie was awful with the exception of two great fight scenes. the rest of the movie was absolute 2020 s marvel trash.
sorry the joker is pure garbage
lmao chinese mythos is dog shit no thanks  had 0 interest in that movie.
shang chI was dumb. annoying characters. stupid plot. poor cgi. a lot of bad marvel movies shows in past several years. this was the one I was most excited about and it was the worst.
no body cares about what you want and if you dont think marvel dc has regularly put out good cinema  plus I cant take you seriously when you wont even pronounce one of the greatest directors of all times name correctly  you are reaching on this one bad take all around
tarantino has always been a racist  the guy constantly writes the n word in his movies
cope
I dont agree with the cgib
@Godpk11  first off Im not a child Im 33 and I know a lot more than you
