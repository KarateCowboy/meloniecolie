the perfect remaster of tr will be one that retains all of the orignal s gameplay mechanics and difficulty and no change to the story or dialogue - just make it look beautiful.  and give lara all her curves back.
literally praying that embracer group sees the potential in  aod for a possible remake   remaster. sick of the  fan service  being left up to the tr community. which time upon time again  have proven to deliver far superior tomb raider games than multImillion dollar gaming studios !!!
admittedly skeptical  given current year. I just hope these tr remasters remakes actually work as opposed to bug out  and classic lara will actually be classic lara as opposed to  modernized   aka. androgynous  lara.
I just hope that if they do this  they do it right. and we ll see a huge influx of people coming back to falling in love with old school tomb raiders  3
this would be great.  the first tomb raider games I have played have been the  survivor  trilogy and I love those games and have played through them several times.  they have me interested in playing the original games  so if any remasters or re-releases come out  Im all about it.
that was fast!  Im cautiously optimistic - good first move  embracer.  bet the remasters will sell like hotcakes.
finally  some hope. if embracer group bring back classic tr  classic lara croft  then they are our only hope
based on your persistent commentary and because its been years I decided to rewatch the first laura croft movie. its such a fun movie. the opening combat scene vs the robot is phenomenal. I think angelina jolie portrays the character well. also the music is great.
hopefully an actual remake remaster does happen. personally Im going to wait to see a released product before getting excited though. too many franchises  not just games but movies tv books too  have been ruined for me just in the last year for me to get my hopes up.
loved getting to hang out with you and the rest of the chat on your twitch channel. it was a lot of fun. looking forward to more.  codemac
really excited for tomb raider fans right now. keeping my fingers crossed for a legacy of kain revival.
I did my first order today from g-fuel.  bought a cup and the blue rocket pop hydration.  I love your energy and yes  we dont always have the same opinion on shows.  thats what makes life interesting.  love the scripture as well.  you have encouraged me when I was in a dark place and I will always be grateful..  1st time in a long time my knees didn t hurt going down stairs.
hI  mel! what do you think about the game over death scenes in tomb raider in general  for me personally  they re way too gruesome all in all and so I hope they get rid of them entirely or at least give us the option to toggle them off.
personally  I am more supportive of remasters for the classic tr series. a lot of times  remakes change the small elements that help shape the original games into absolute gems. for instance  the blocky graphics and shapes of the tomb raider levels sometimes obscure paths  which would be obvious with sharper visuals. that would lower the times the player needs to use the most important button in the classic series. the look button. looking around and thinking  walking slowly and observing the enviorment  stopping to see something beautiful or something that you barely missed in the corner of your eye. that is a core tomb raider experience  that doesnt get talked nearly enough. it is an important element that needs to be preserved  which I feel is easier to do with a remaster  rather than a remake. plus  the classic games dont need a lot changed. a stable way to play them and... thats about all that is missing.
I have some hope. but Im still cautiously skeptical. I have to see what they plan on producing first in order to get excited cause words just dont cut it anymore. learned that lesson with star wars  marvel  dc  and so on. but we ll see! hopefully embracer turns the ships around from the iceberg thatsquare enix   crystal dynamics put it on.
could you all imagine new remakes of all the 6 original games   like I would break down and cry if they did it well and we have lara back. as for melonie  its great to see someone so passionate. I stand with you on your opinions with tr
anniversary  underworld  and legend are my favorites. would love remasters.
been an avid gamer since the 80s  and the five core eidos tomb raider games stands as towering achievements in gaming history  and their current status as  forgotten  is a true tragedy. ironically  as Im slowly moving my way through  dark souls  for the very first time  Ive been hitseveral times by a weird tr-feeling. not that classic tr has much in common with dark souls  its more the feeling of loneliness  checking every inch of environment  the lack of music  the difficulty  the rare checkpoints and so on. its a weird deja vu  but I get that from ds. so  basically  they have all the ingredients  and even the games  to create a giant success out of classic tr gameplay  they just have to realise the fact  that players in 2022 are sick and tired of hand-holding  cut-scenes  and never-ending clues from lara. we want difficulty  we want to be left alone in the dark tombs  and we want the  sound of a secret  to return.
Im subscribing  you ride so hard for the tomb raider community
the fact melonie has been banned in tomb raider fan groups makes me more proud of her lmfaoo as someone who is banned twice on twitter  once on both facebook and instagram and God knows how many dc comics and other groups fan pages I stand by anyone banned for standing up to their beliefs lol
look up  tomb raider reloaded fan art  and one of the first things that pops up is the best variation of lara since  03.
I think fans have already done that in a few trle projects.
I agree with you  the story must remain exactly how it originally is  but I think the dialogue in a lot of the cutscenes must be fleshed out some  especially in tr2   3.  like for example  core interactive never explained or told the back story of the italian cult  fiamma nera  and their leader marco bartolI with the desire to obtain the dagger of xian other than just worshiping it or to gain the ability to transform into a dragon to wreak destruction.  I dont think core even mentioned the name of the cult to begin with.  I didn t even know marco bartolI s cult had a name if it wasn t for me coincidentally reading about it about a week ago on a wikI page.  and I even played the game when it first came out back in  97 or  98  whatever year it was.it would also be nice to show a flashback cutscene showing the barkhang monks sinking the maria doria with marco s father aboard  giannI  fearing that the dagger of xian would fall into the fiamma nera s hands.  all kinds of new and awesome dialogue could be added to greatly improve the narrative of the story.
I agree. will we truly get that however
this will be amazing!! Imean we can see lara and kurtis again!
meh tomb raider legend is the best
@kochI daisukeÂ  tr legend is nice  but isn t a classic like aod  and I will like that they make a remake at a classic game  but if is legend or underwolrd its ok too.
aods storyline was so cool but so much was cut scrapped. aod itself.. shit game
imagine the crash bandicoot issue with the jumping  I love the remakes btw  but its faults makes me prefer the originals
I agree
that lara news can go both ways and could end in a nightmare I never ever wanted to see.I just hope it will be good but definitely not set the bar high in my expectations. and your closing speech I applaud you  standing. bravo.
if they make a remake I will buy it  as long as its the same everything. I loved the controls and duel pistols  the perfect game!!
hello melonie  hope all is well! in regards to the tomb raider remakes and or remasters  which approach do you prefer. a great example is the resident evil 1 remake or the resident evil 2 and 3 remake approaches
and suddenly melonie transformed into an anime character.... nice.... more on point though  nice to see lara finally having some hope about getting some love  now hoping thatshe gets a better home where people actually care about the character and her story.
embracer is also rumored to be behind the duke nukem forever leak. they actually like and care about gaming itseems. they have my full faith and support.
I hope they do the remasters in the same style we saw crash n sane trilogy  spyro reignited trilogy and medievil. dont change too much just update the graphics
love your content!  d Imight play the old tomb raiders now because of you !
please please please let it happen!
now that tomb raider is square enix free I see great potential in the croft franchise.
I like this news. even more so the fact the legacy of kain series can get remastered.
I really hope she hulk is good.  the trailer looked really good and disney managed not to woke it up.
I think she-hulk looks fine  barring some low-budget cgI . Im not overly hyped  but I hope its fun. the fact that youre not hating on she-hulk just proves that youre a free thinker. its a very refreshing  and incredibly rare  quality on social media these days. I ll watch it regardless because I love the universe that they ve built. I try to just remember  there s thousands of superheroes  they wont all be for me. however  I ll give anything a chance  and if its not for me  thats ok too  it will be for someone  and I ll just carry on about my day. its saddening that this has become heretical.
sometime 2 years ago square enix filed a trademark for a game called  tomb raider  the ultimate experience  true   which was supposed to be a collection of tomb raider games but I guess they never went through with it and now that embracer group is at the helm maybe we will finally see the collection be realized cuz it was supposed to be a compilation from the classic and legend eras as well as the lara croft spin-off games but now since the lara croft spin-off games are coming out on switch separately it will probably be a collection of games from the classic and legend eras which I am down for.
my must haves for new tomb raider games would be  actually challenging puzzles  classic look  and return to acrobatic combat.  additionally less mommy and daddy issues and no love interest  Ive always thought lara s true love was adventure  would be nice.
the people I follow  I follow because I want to hear their opinions  not because I expect their opinions to mirror my own. hearing a lot of different people talk on an issue just gives you more information from which to better refine your own opinion. what I find really weak  is when people accuse youtubers of  just doing it for clicks.  how can one accuse someone of effectively being a grifter when there is a 10 minute video in which the person explains their opinion  itsound more to me like an attempt to discreditsimply because they disagree. as for she-hulk  I thought the cgI looked objectively bad  and I thought the bridal carry at the end was pretty cringe. but other than that itseems like ally mcbeal on the cw. it could be funny  it could be fun  its probably not for me  and thats just fine. the thing everyone needs to remember is that entertainment and media have clobbered us all so unrelentingly with wokeness over the past several years  its hard not to be hypersensitive. its like we are all whipped puppies reacting to a person raising his hand. when you are used to that hand holding a rolled up newspaper  you tend to react before you see that the person is really just reaching out to pet you.
I dont really know if I am interested about remasters I would probably would like to see remakes but with the exact vibe of tomb raider !   I know its difficult to achieve something like that but I feel like the graphics from the first tomb raider cant really work in 2022   I have tried to play as well the games again this year but they look so old and crappy so I would like to see remakes anyway I want so badly lara s attitude and personality come back again in the new games I have really miss her..
okay I need that gfeul fridge...and if hollywood had any sense  they would cast melonie as lara croft.
very cool but I fear they ll wokeify classic lara croft thats my concern otherwise hopefully it ll be awesome
as someone who s only played the new tomb raider stuff  but watched the older movie - I d love for them to remaster the older titles.
I would play the shit out of a remaster. thats like 25 years ago. it d be like reliving my childhood.
I think they should take a tomb raider anniversary approach  the tomb raider remake that was released in 2007 . they kept lara the same  didn t massively change her personality at all  and her outfit wasn t changed at all. the story was only expanded not really changed.resident evil 3 is probably one of the worst remakes out there as they did tons and tonnssss of cuts  jill s personality was completely changed  her outfit was completely changed  just absoutley no.
@ladylaracroft96Â  oh I see  unfortunately Ive never played any of the tomb raider games except for the original game and the most recent trilogy that resembles uncharted. yes I agree with what you said about resident evil 3 remake. it was definitely the most unfaithful remakes of the re remakes and I was disappointed with it. hopefully they wont re3 the classical tomb raider games.
@praetorianÂ  hey if you have steam they have almost all the tomb raider games! should check them out!
@ladylaracroft96Â  no  unfortunately I dont have steam. I will look into it thanks.
careful there s people who scream  homophobia  and say homophobia fir saying the lara x sam ship is dumb lol. just had that experience earlier
they need to just let us use the opengl versions  if I remember correctly those are playable on windows 10 and 11 with some quick and readily available fixes.
thats embracer group for you  they  ahem  embrace bringing back the old-school. now bring some legacy of kain on top of that!  also  how about a lara croft-themed gfuel flavor   this tastes like danger.
bartolI s hideout is what I think of when classic tomb raider is mentioned
the ultimate stream would be you playing the classic tomb raider series. also download slay the spire and yes it is a truly addicting game lol
finally we won and we will see the original lara come
hoping they take a leaf out of niko bass tomb raider dagger of xian I would love them to partner up or remake the classics in a similar way. either way I am hyped that they are now confirming remakes and remasters its been way too long
I d like remasters too  if they remake them who knows what changes they d make.  also remakes would take forever  just fix issues  add 60 fps.
Im hoping the tr remasters are like the medievil remaster. fresh coat of paint and analog compatible.
I d right swipe  you seem very wholesome keep up the good work. also totally made my day with comment being read.
yes we need this!!!
yeah classic laura is coming back crossing fingers for hope
we need a proper remake remaster of tr. bring the visuals up to date  more stylized not realism . the gameplay and mechanics to remain the same with slight quality of life improvements. keep the level design. dont go and change stuff that will the make the game unrecognizable from the original. dont you dare change the uI either. I loved seeing all the icons swirl out and in. demon s souls remake was able to do a great job and retain its original identity. maybe if you get all the secrets you unlock the unfinished business levels.
I cant believe melonie mac is talking about tomb raider.
the remakes part kind of worries me. Im afraid they ll make them worse. gotta be honest though  a remake of angel of darkness would be nice. that one can definitely be improved.
we are tired of remakes in the video game and movie industries.  how do they not know this
all hail the mighty embracer  well they brought kingdoms of amalur back  so I automatically like  em.
I hope this will be good as a classic tomb raider fan I am worried though. I am concerned that they will try and update censor it for modern audiences. I could see them trying to make lara more ugly and masculine  censoring her outfits etc and maybe even the more gruesome triggering stuff in the game. so I am hoping for the best but I am preparing and unfortunately even expecting for the worse. I hope the remaster of the classic games if anything would be more like say the spyro reignited remaster which to me is the gold standard of game remasters remakes.
am I the only one who s getting sailor jupiter vibes from melonie s hair look  looks nice.
id love a remaster! a remake really didnt work for me  anniversary took out all of the complex puzzles and just added more platforming. remastering the originals would be the biggest love letter to the fans
downloading slay the spire bcuz melonie kinda got me into it to be honest wasn t a bad looking game watching her play it
yess I want some soul reaver
lara
lara...... you mean ...... huh
do not trust to hope.. it has forsaken these lands.
would I like to see good remasters remakes   sequals  I do  but im extremely hesitant. in todays gaming world remaster remakes are mainly used to censor and rewrite the o.g. characters and lore. so im not going to get hyped about this till I know they will do lara and the ip justice  every inch they deviate is one inch to much for me. so I will wait and see what they come up with  but im not going to hold my breath that they will restore her to her full former glory. of course the same applies to game design and gameplay mechanics  which at the bare minimum it has to be of the level we had pre abominable reboots.
they need to do a remastered collection of all the classic tomb raider games and fix all the bugs glitches as well as do a remaster of angel of darkness with cut content added in and fix all the bugs glitches. I would also like them to add extra stuff to the games. if the angel of darkness remaster is done in the way Imentioned and does well then I would like a sequel to it  which if I remember correctly it was originally going to get. a remastered legend era collection would be cool too but personally I wouldn t play that.
I cant get excited for remasters as much in 2022   Im more like  lets find out what was cut or censored from the original this time
I still have my tomb raider trilogy ps3 disc and the older discs its baffling why the ps3 hd collection wasn t ported over.
more tombs and more raiding.
metroid samus returns and legend of zelda link s awakening  resident evil  2002 gamecube  remakes are all top notch. the legend of zelda ocarina of time 3d on 3ds is a damn good remaster.
I want classic tomb raider remasters with controller support.
I know I am a day late but you were the first person I thought of when this news dropped.
Im so happy for you. I guess we cant get you a celebratory cake  so what should we get
repeat after me... I  want  tomb  raider  remasters  in  crash  n sane trilogy  style
as long as melonie mac owns tomb raider  the franchise is safe.
I d like see remasters of the legacy of kain series
just finishing my first g fuel pack.  I like black on blackberry.
gotta install the mods for the og tomb raider games so youre not stuck playing in a dos box and can play in 4k
thats awesome but I dont have high hopes  because crystal dynamics is still involved. unless they give it to someone else to do the remastered. I dont trust crystal dynamics  they have not done any good tomb raider game. love the hoodie mel
decent remasters would definitely be appreciated. though what I d predict is that the main traction will of course come from die hard fans of the old days  and whether or not the remasters are a success will be based on whether the old fans canturn a profit for how much ever money went into remastering. the only way they d be able to really make a dent into the population of newcomers or new fans that came from the reboot is if they make a significant change to the old games to warrant some kind of fascination. whatever they do with the old material  I just want them to expand on the story and lore that was already there. like tomb raider 2 and 3 have some fascinating and somewhat complex historical lore and behind-the-scenes events that never got explained in the cutscenes of  97 and  98  so fleshing out thatstuff would pull me back in. Imay be a fan of the older games  but I wouldn t have much of a desire to revisit them for the 900th time if the changes only included quality of life and visual improvements.
as a long time marvel fan   Im completely ok with she - hulk . its meant to be comedic sorta like deadpool from what I hear . Ive never looked into the comics but Im sure this will be good marvel material in some way shape or form .
0 10 the cat always leaves as soon as she starts a video. what s going on with that  the cat is like  Im outta here.
if re can get a remake in 2002  and re 2  3 get remakes in the modern era  I cannot see what harm it would do to pump out a remaster or remake for tr. hold your expectations back mel  you know just how badly companies can screw up these kinds of things.
I d prefer remasters of the old games  not full on remakes that look all realistic  I d rather have just remasters so really nothing changed except quality of life improvements like checkpoints that are optional of course  manual and auto saves anywhere but also save crystals as optional for those who want more challenge like myself  and just a more smoother experience so I dont want lara to be hyper realistic  I want the cartoony style to remain  just look better if that makes sense like closer to all the promotional art from back then  pretty sure they could accomplish that today
this is the kinda of bullshitsquare said  oh it wouldn t be successful.  do you understand how massive remasters ports are right now  every major game series is doing remasters because their is a ridiculously high demand to preserve these big ip s older games. resident evil  spyro  crash  ninja gaiden  grand theft auto  mario games  streets of rage  teenage mutant ninja turtles  the list goes on and on and on in the past several years that companies see how ridiculously massive the demand is for access to older games.the coast for ports would be literally almost nothing so I dont want to hear bullshit  idk if they will make money  when the tr reboot trilogy massively underperformed and coast and grand total of 300 million dollars to mas
hImelonie I really like your comfyoutfit .thank you for always speaking your mind on these interesting topics may you continue be blessed  bring out these verse of the daytakecare melonie
good attitude about people blocking you! also  right on about there being no profit in worrying over if youre on the right path or not if youre doing your best to follow God s commandments. it is true that you usually dont need big signs from God to know the right direction to go  but there have been times in my life  twice in particular  when God made it pretty clear he did not want me to go down a certain path.
hey melonie I just want to tell you that I am sorry if this is so late but I just want to tell you that I am so hyped and stoked for this new tomb raider video game finally happening. anyway I can not wait to get my hands on this new video game so I can enjoy it and play it over and over until I get tired of playing this cool and rad new tomb raider video game. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that I am so sorry for this being late comment from yesterday post video  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today at the gym and at home with your pets  ok melonie. anyway have a great day melonie.
nice I d love to play these games on my ps4
dont hold your breath  probably going to update the game for  modern times .
remake and reimagined is just code for  we are gonna ruin it . remasters is a safer bet but still they might mess with the games story and mechanics to  fix problematic content .
remastering the whole tr line will be amazing! just hope they keep the gameplay from the original and  Im sold.
mel you have done it. you used the power of manifestation.. ive accieved this as well. just on unfortunate ones. like killing issac hayes.. I was a disher at lamadeline. when I heard a song by luther vandross. it was so good and I put my arms out and clenched fists and screamed why Lord ! why take luther  why didnt you take issac hayes... he died the following morning..I was devastated and was just joking  but if you channel the wave pattern.  it does happen and im not bs ing. even if I sound insane. I am not..I really loved him in im gonna git ya sucka and south park too. all of us have these abilities.. good on ya and I appreciate some tr redux s comin out in the future.
finally  a sensible person  using dark mode for twitter any webzone.
I want legacy of kain and tomb raider remasters! they already did crash and spyro! what about the serious games!
hope they do right with tomb raider this time! rise and shadow left a bad taste on my mouth...
remakes of the older games would be better but still an okay decision from developers.
they need to remake tr 2-3   revelations!
need to make lara a male who is pregnant and is awaiting surgery to transform into a unicorn  that would be awesome
petition for a holy water flavor gfuel!
ok so  they will 100  do a remaster of the originals.its the safest bet right now  it also judges the market  they could also release the remasters of the reboot series.
@melonie mac go boom     regarding she hulk  I suspect some of the dislike to this show is rooted in the fact that the mcu now has  woke elements   for lack of a better term  running through all its productions.  it can in a way be expressed by the old cliche    fool me once  shame on you.    fool me twice  shame on me.   if this show were being released as is  but none of the wokeness that currently exists was prevalent in society  I suspect the reaction would not be as harsh.
digging the g-fuel hoodie
Ive been stuck in the same routine for a long time now. its not a bad routine but Im getting tired of it. Ive been praying every night that God will nudge me in the right direction  but like you said he isn t going to just show me exactly what I should do. I know I need to take the first step.
fingers crossed  raider fans. fingers crossed.
imagine if they come to switch..
remakes have been the trend lately in the gaming and movie industry so Im not surprised by it. just as long as its good than awful.
a remaster is just what we needed! that being said im perfectly okay if they feel the need to recorrect the tr 2 scene with lara in the himalayas  wearing full winter gear. or if they need to implement some sort of humane way to take down dogs  like some sort of dart gun. but for the love of God  do not take make lara look androgynous.
tomb raider already  has a sort of  remaster  with the open source engine  openlara running on many platforms  in hd
damn girl you look good. like really really good. you look healthy af and attractive. I saw the video with your old pics and you have definitely found your diet. Im very happy for you and just wanted to give an honest congratulations.
well  you just made my day  apparently! ha
I remember the gta definitive edition.stay frosty tomb raider fans  stay frosty!
I wont buy it from pewd s  I wont buy it from  sog  but I will try the sonic flavor from mel.
got my fingers crossed
id rather they had the balls just to make a new game with classic lara rather than remakes but unfortunately studios never take risks so they would likley do remakes first to see how they sell then if they sell well they will make a new classic lara game  playing the long game so to speakid rather they jumped straight into something new and exiting  remakes are so predictable and safe
Im waiting on nintendo to release hd remaster of legend of zelda wind waker and metroid prime or prime trilogy.
so we are boomers now! that would make me a double boomer as I am old and a baby boomer.
your hair looks gorgeous.
yeah  my memory of classic lara is a little... tesla.
they ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars reinventing the wheel when they could have just given us the classic trilogy with better textures the cutscene lara model. include the tr gold levels. improve sound quality of the soundtrack. maybe add some unlockable skins and some easter eggs if youre feeling real fancy. thats basically what fans have wanted since the ps2 era. that the franchise has passed through so many hands an no one has thought to do this says either that they brought in all the wrong people for their focus groups or genuinely no one has been paying attention.
imagine when they do remaster classic tomb raider they replace lara with reboot lara
full confession never finished the original game.  could not stand watching lara die so I stopped playing.
everytime we see a remaster something goes wrong. I hope they dont remaster the old games.get ready for some heavy censorship with embracer group handling the ips.
loving the white vibe!
what they did with tomb raider anniversary  just do the same for tomb raider 2 and 3. and I ll be fine with that. and offer the original unaltered low res games as a bonus feature.
make tomb raider great again
this isn t accessible to the general public. remasters need to happen so its easily accessible like the reboot games are. accessibility and preservation of games matter   ! happy embracer would never listen to someone like you!

really  what did they censor aside from the new saints row
they playskooled anniversary  I would rather them not baby down 2 and 3 as well lol
miturga!
nothing wrong with calling a bad opinion a bad opinion for that in itself is an opinion.
its probably going to take five years to do a remaster or remake of any kind with tomb raider. I dont care how is developing it  five years minimum.
fix the broken camera problem in angel  and put the first 6 games o switch  and ps4.
marvel s phase 4 has been one disappointment after another  except for no way home. Im very wary of the upcoming she-hulk series  but your trailer reaction reminded me that we dont know for sure that its bad. if they would just stick to the classic comics instead of trying to reinvent the characters and stories sigh
they should so a remake of tomb raider iI  tomb raider iiI and tomb raider the last revelation
I dont think anybody s overreacting or enjoying feelings of hatred. this version of jennifer looks like the people the show was made for  losers who want power.
I have a feeling embracer will do more for tomb raider than square-enix did for the last couple of years. that goes for deus ex too.
pockets hanging out the bottom of jeans shorts  is it 2009 again already
I completely disagree with those comments on she hulk. nerdrotic is one of the most knowledgeable people on marvel  no I dont think he simply hates mcu  I think he hate disney because they deserve it. Im not putting any money or energy toward groomers that destroyed skywalker and near everything else they touch.Im not a consumer  Im a customer. those who want to mindlessly consume this corporatist social justice grooming filth  knock yourself out just stop coping by pulling others into it. go watch it and be happy with mediocrity.
she-hulk  sex and the city
dating apps are infinitely easier for women than men. Ive done the experiment myself. the woman was getting hundreds of likes within a day while the man  was literally a male model  got less than 100 within a week. its an un-fair game even if youre a male model.
a remaster of the classic tom raider games would be sweet . as a dude I have to say that as far as ladies not swiping right on a lot of men s profiles men only swipe right more often because it is a lot more difficult for a man to get a date than for a woman to get a date . men do not have the greatest options iether . I do not want to date a 500 pound   single mother   with 8 kids all from different fathers and is missing teeth not only that but most of those teeth are yellow and she has a shag carpet under each of her arms but I guess I am just triggered . one more thing  can we stop pretending that triggers are exclusive to liberals   democrats   millenials and gen z . everyone throughout history has had triggers . I agree with you on things that people like or dont like . I have no idea why people get in arguments over that does me not liking something really affect other people   does it really make me a hostile power
guys  guess how old melanie mac is
that hoodie is sick
why s she so hot now !
who else wanna tomb raider legend underworld remaster
being critical of she hulk doesnt mean youre toxic tho  like that one person commented. that cgI needs serious work tho  its too uncanny valley
g fuel should be thrilled to have you !
wonder if they ll remaster angel of darkness.......nah  Im kidding lol
guys guys steam is having a sale on all tomb raider games 98 cents each Imean classic games also the new ones but the classics are the ones at 98 cents go gooooo
thats a pretty huge milestone considering tomb raider went from 35 to 88 million copies sold worldwide since square enix took over.
@backup368Â  yeah  back when it took over. but not in last half a decade. they didn t even lay a finger in series  25th anniversary. it just tells you thatsquare-enix doesnt think highly of the series when they sold it for a pocket change.
@clifffitter89Â  maybe it was the best offer embracer had for them.
that needs a complete and utter remake from the ground up incorperating all of the cut content that would complete the original story that the devs had originally intended as a trilogy
@creativewm_personalÂ  agree.
accept the Bible stuff this was a very good video for me. nice job
the new tomb raider ip owners better bring back the real lara croft with her duel sidearms   john-woo like agility who laughs in the face of danger and serves up a silver platter of 9mm bullets thy would be fools! thats lara croft! and not some flat chested blubbering plastic reality tv personality  too pathetic to even reach a low hanging ledge thats 5 feet above her head.
we want lara more curvy.... but not in belly parts...
youre new hair is not fair  I cant watch at work and reasonably expect to get anything done
@melonie mac go boom     truth in advertising  I am not sure I agree with youregarding nasa.  however  I want to hear more of what you think.  Imight -- or might not -- agree with you.
whats the bet thatshe s a little.........flatter   p
hey cool  I got a shout out this episode
I do not want remakes  and sadly I have no faith in quality remasters.
omg! the flat earth  dont tell me..
I think your channel has a bit masquerading as you  if a certain comment on your latest video is any indication.....
nasa  what the hell you been spending all our tax dollars on since you went to the moon
latest tomb raider trilogy woke dialogs is so cringe! hope for total change of dialogs.
I ll take the legend game remastered. remakes of the classics   game play intact. transmedia products should give you pause. transmedia is just a dumpster fire.
same game remade in a new modern engine with modern graphics if so then yes if some polished ancient turd engine like the gta remaster then hell no
second!
I dont want to be that guy melanie but your hair you look way better when they are straight like avril lavigne style just saying
hopefully they did not get sjw rhianna pratchett along with the deal.

I specifically want remakes not re imaginings. anniversary was trash that butchered tomb raider 1 to plague the game with ledge hopping madness.
