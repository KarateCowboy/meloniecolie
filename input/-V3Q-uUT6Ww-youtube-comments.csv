how they could think changing galadriel from a sorcerer to a barbarian was a good idea I ll never know.
Ive read the silmarillion four or five times through since high school. its my favorite of tolkien s works and to hear the conceited butchery of this material  well  I cant adequately describe the emotion that it provokes in me  but its squarely negative. very. squarely. deeply. negative.
galadriel was already powerful to begin with. she was intelligent  wise and beautiful. much like a guardian angel. no need to change her.
she s convinced that evil is lurking closer than anyone realizes  what was her first clue  before or after the numenorians started sacrificing humans on an alter to an evil God  this show is going to be hot trash.
as someone who loves tolkien this show hurts me right down to my very soul the more I hear.
galadriel could do more with a glance than any warLord. they nerfed her big time.
evil sorceress galadriel was one of my favorite scenes from the three movies.  amazon galadriel feels like a bad joan of arc movie.  hard pass.
tar-muriel being queen of numenor instead of ar-pharazon is more than just a minor plot detail. pharazon usurping the throne is extremely important in the story of the fall of numenor  as his actions are what drives numenor into becoming a puppet of sauron and eventually destroying itself. without him  you have a massive plot hole in the middle of the second age.
galadriel is a wise  royal angelic being over 3500 years old depending on what version she could even be 5000. she s already enlightened by the light of the 2 trees in valinor and lived through the first age  the amount of experience and wisdom at that woman in the second age is beyond human understanding but no her rage needs to be contained by a normal man  far younger and less wise to keep her in check. not the other way around because that would be  misogynistic  even doe him controlling her rage is also misogynistic  way to go amazon. her might and magic makes any sword useless for her. and now we see even more  powerful women  yaaaaay  ar pharasson forced his cousin to marry her so he could take her throne. then he was incredibly greedy for power and wanted immortality  something sauron managed to trick him into if you worship  morgoth  sauron s master  the God of evil if you will. and he did and that lead to a lot of terrible things  Im not gonna spoil it . but now he s a beta male and advicer to his  strong independent powerful woman cousin queen    yaaaay awesome ..  sarcasm  I cringe so hard!!!
Ive read all these books so many times it actually numbers in the 100s. this character isn t galadriel. its eowyn - full stop! and its so convoluted its clear they re throwing crap against the wall and going with what sticks. good thing those walls are well oiled with lore b c none of it is sticking. there s lots of snippets in the appendices they could ve explored. they ve simply chosen to approach this in a malicious and dishonest way.
thank you for your support against this perversion of tolkien s work. I have read all of the professor s books and have much love for the literature. knowing all of the histories of the ages and seen how it is being warped is disheartening. thank you again  Ive subscribed to your channel and canceled my amazon account. aure entuluva.
I remember there being a writers strike in hollywood back in 2007  but did it ever really end  why else would they be hiring so many inexperienced writers for all of these series  or are they really just so cheap that they dont want to pay the good writers.....yeah  they would be.
upon reading an adaptation pitch  tolkien responded    I do earnestly hope that in the assignment of actual speeches to the characters they will be represented as I have presented them  in style and sentiment. I should resent perversion of the characters  and do resent it  so far as it appears in this sketch  even more than the spoiling of the plot and scenery.   - j.r.r. tolkien thats proof tolkien detested and resented adaptations that mess with his languages  lore or characters. anyone who regards themselves as an artist in film adaption would respect the creator! these amazon people are not artists  they re activists. peter jackson stuck to the lore and respected tolkien as best he could even though he also had to succumb to new line cinemas many hollywood stipulations when he made the lotr trilogy. he and his team followed the lore and didn t worry about world politics. then his lotr trilogy changed cinema as we knew it. it broke records for oscar award wins and made more money than any film in history  at the time . sticking to the lore would have been soooo lucrative for amazon! but they cant see past their noses with all this woke-ism. if they stuck to the lore  fans and  normies  alike would have broken out in a rash from excitement and would have turned out their pockets for a lore-based adaptation. why  because the true fans would have informed the journalists who then would informed the normies to be excited. kind of like  street cred . corporations have lost their sense of how to truly reel the masses in. the masses really crave authenticity. authenticity sells. if amazon stuck to the lore the  woke  culture would not have known what hit them either. they would have just loved it like they loved the books. what a repugnant miss by amazon. I hope us tolkien readers and fans will keep up our fight for sticking to the lore until and after the rings of power airs. enough is enough.
as long as we re painting within those lines and not egregiously contradicting something you dont have the rights to  there s a lot of leeway and room to dramatize and tell some of the best stories that  tolkien  ever came up with  but you are egregiously contradicting something you dont have the rights to and if tolkien didn t write the story its not his story its yours using his work as a foundation. if tolkien wrote these stories we d have had access to them for years now because he would have written them.
excellent vod  mel! I was hoping you were going to make that pippin joke. laughed my butt off. you did not disappoint.
seeing those books come to life was nothing short of a phenomenal work of art from all everyone involved. its a real shame to see what is happening with lotr now. btw you appeared on my feed kinda out of the blue and its made me happy to see someone speaking what Ive been thinking. totally agree with your take on lara croft also. ugh this woke crap is everywhere. great vids keep it going!
the only purpose of using lotr instead of making their own show was the established fanbase- which backfired spectacularly because faith to source matters to legit fanbases.
dwarfs are naturals at trans because they have a beard and woke rings removed it  now they turn gladriel into zena warrior princess
for those who may be intimidated by the length of the books  you can find audio book versions of the Lord of the rings  the hobbit  the silmarillion  and other works of tolkien including the children of hurin voiced by sir Christopher lee. really helped me learn proper word pronunciation too.
the movies came out when I was about your age. I first watched fellowship on a flight home from my vacation in france. I didn t really  get  the movie at the time until later that fall when I bought the book and really enjoyed the movies once I understood the lore better. I was lucky enough to see two towers and return of the king when released in theater and saw each one twice.
more like paladin  but yeah. sucks.
@zerobyte  they clearly said that galadriel chose to rage. therefore she is a barbarian.  p
its not dungeons and dragons is it
based
I haven t read silmarillion since I was in college. I recently purchased ted nasmith s illustrated version. looking forward to it.
tolkien isn t in my top 20 but wheel of time was just wokified enough for me. I think everyone has  a favorite destroyed that just disgusts you.  love texas roadhouse prime rib. liken to bring out a fried nutella sandwich with glass of piss and expected me to love it and pay for it. also get guilt lectures of being a racist would probably not go back.
@shade38211  I picked up the wheel of time about two months before the show aired. damn it if half an episode of that wasn t enough to have me turn it off in disgust. I dont think robert jordan will ever supplant tolkien for me  but I feel your pain. silver lining  I know a lot more people who are reading the wheel of time books now.
@stephen fitzgerald  actually used to wait for wheel of time  drizzt salvatore  terry brooks shannara  and others to come out. that was before amazon. have read and reread books as many as 10 times and you get different perspective as you age.  the more you like certain characters   the more you get immersed and enjoy. these people are not telling the actual stories but writing new stories with beloved best sellers to cover their activism. in ten years activists inputting their politics and virtue signaling have destroyed sports  movies  literature   to put themselves as the plot.  watched the adaptation of wot and each episode got me more pissed. should have just looked up twitter of so called writer before I watched. none stop social justice and women empowerment nonsense. out of all the series I read   wot has some of best female characters going. two rivers is town that has basically been isolated for 2000 years and somehow they have 10 ethnicities     just plainly defies logic as everyone would be very similar unless certain parts of towns never let you marry others. when they gave pivotal climax of killing trollocs to eugene instead rand actually doing it  was end for me.
the silmarillion is quite a difficult book to read its even taught at university   so its unlikely youread it 4 or 5 times at high school .you can watch the peter jacksons movies to see that they are not following the lore probably in this new series the rings of power
they dont have the rights to silmarrillion  unfinished tales  history of me. show is woke fanfiction
@mamamob  stole the words from my mouth..
@mamamob  the ability to be kind and caring comes from the knowledge that one can easily be the opposite but choose not to.. thats my belief anyway
@mamamob  exactly. I hate that feminists did this. turned us into men in order to come off as strong. as if traditional femininity  nurturing  graceful  soft  beautiful  isn t strong as hell as it is. they have to make us  butch bad asses  who fight better than men twice our size. I realize femininity cantake many forms  but in general  its a particular set of traits that I think are incredibly powerful. when we turn women into men in order to call them strong  we diminish that which is truly feminine.
@persephone l  right.  there is so much to be said for feminine strength.  it is the wee hours of the morning  and I am not going to go there at this hour  but I am always still glad to see thatsome people still recognize this.  but I will part with this  I guess.  if you look at my thumbnail  that picture is a spotted hyena.  spotted hyena are one of the very few mammals where females are physically dominant over the males  larger  stronger  as well as more socially organized.  in fact  the males are kicked out of their native clan  and forced to find a new family that will adopt them.  fascinating as spotted hyena are  is that really the model that we as human beings want to liken ourselves to   hyenas are that way by nature  and built for that niche. we cant as humans cant simply  identify  ourselves into being things that we simply are not built to be  nor should we burden ourselves with some constructed obligation to be those things we are not!  let spotted hyena be spotted hyena.  let women be strong and beautiful as women.  let men be confident and courageous as men.  lets just stop pretending we have to be all these things we are not!  who told us that wasn t enough anyway  because it is such a lie!
@persephone l  exactly! turning women to look like men is ironically anti-feminist. like  they think a woman can be consider strong if she s got a body figure similar to men or wearing masculine costumes. its basically making men as a standart of a strong woman  instead of women themselves.back in the 80s   90s  feminists were campaigning thatstrong women can look sexy  graceful  lovely  soft  even sassy   wearing feminine clothes thatshows how great their body were. it was hated by old prude people who wanted women to wear dresses that covering from their neck to ankles without showing too much body curves. now feminist are campaigning for women to wear dresses that covering from their neck to ankles  or even wearing men s clothes  as long as women dont show too much body curves. now feminists are becoming like those old prude people.women can wear whatever dress suit they like  but creating the  strong woman  image solely based on masculine style is really limiting women s characteristics   making the  strong woman  type a caricature anecdotal model.
rings of power is nothing more than disgusting fan fiction.
exactly she s so skilled in magic her being a warrior is preposterous.
@leroy russell  not really fanfiction either because they re not really fans much.
@cj isawesome  agreed.
wait  human sacrifice is wrong
@transroofkorean  not when its abortion. then its a  choice .
@transroofkorean  yes  its the reason why the aztecs and mayans were wiped out from the face of the earth
@transroofkorean  based
@transroofkorean  Im not picturing virginal women  Im picturing the entire magic the gathering community
@the 98th emperor of the holy britannian empire  they re why I can keep up this rate and never run out
wait  what ! ...human sacrafices! ....what the hell amazon !
@kittI erd lyi  thats a tolkien thing. sauron gets ar-pharazon to build a temple to melkor and start sacrificing people to him.
@shane the stoic  thank you for made it clear.
whatever this piece of cultural vandalism is  it is not Lord of the rings.just like how car wreck  discard is not star trek  and the marey sue trilogy is not star wars.
@knowbody  the thing is  it will be for an entirely new generation of fans of tolkiens work.
@joshua newey  it wont. not even the people who pretend to like it will keep watching it years down the track.
@joshua newey  Ive never wanted someone to be wrong quite so much as I want you to be wrong about that. but youre probably right  it will     then they ll go back and watch the lotr movies and wonder why there are so many darn white people and why no one is chastising them  and why it appears that most of the strongest warriors are men. I despise this all so much lol
galadriel  warrior princess
@richard rose  exactly. the warrior princess would better fit her cousin aredhel.
I actually joked around to a friend of mine that they are gonna make galadriel angry warrior whamen and elrond a weak effiminate male.did not realize that they would switch ar-pharazons and tar-miriel s roles as well.you got me good amazon!
maybe not totally angelic. galadriel at that time was a little spiteful. like at the end of the first-stage when eonwe told her she s not allowed to go back to valinor because she was a leader in the rebellion. so she told him she never wanted to go back home anyway.
I know what you mean and youre right! I didn t necessarily refer to her temper only  but more to her as an entire being and elves in general.  specially the high elves  are like angelic creatures.
@gel gaputan  isn t she a descendant of the valar like gandalf
@spartan300 gandalf is an angelic spirit lesser in power than the valar. he is a servant of the valar. galadriel is the grand daughter of the first elven high king. born in the undying lands in the ultimate west where the valar live
@juuso vuolle  its quite a long time ago since I read tolkiens books so apart from you tube lore videos Im not precise on some descriptions of characters but thanks for the info
@spartan300  no she wasn t. it was luthien who had a maia for a mother. also the valar dont have kids. I n the drafts they had  but tolkien scraped them. galadriel s a full-blooded elf. her great uncle thingol was the one who married the maia melian and their daughter was luthien. tbh pharazon is also like a really really small part maiar  and Imean really really small  since he s a descendant of luthien
@gel gaputan  I dont think that pharazon belonged to elros s family tree
@juuso vuolle  ar-pharazon was m riel s cousin. his dad was gimilkhad who was the younger brother of tar-palantir. tar-palantir was m riel s dad. in fact  ar-pharazon s grandmother was inzilbeth who was a grandchild of the 14th Lord of andunie. inzilbeth was a secret member of the faithful. thats why tar-palantir turned out great.
@gel gaputan  oh right I totally forgot that they were cousins damn son some times the apple not only falls far from the tree  it chokes you as its final deed.
@gel gaputan  that was the 1st age by the 2nd age she was starting to calm down. she was still prideful at times.
@shayla  exactly she was prideful. oh man  if I hd any hope in this show I would ve wanted to see the part where the mirdain chased galadriel  amroth  and celebrian away from eregion. not celeborn though  dude was traumatized at the thought of entering caves
the writers are still on strike and were replaced by activists.
@dark hierophant  took the words right out of my mouth.
bingo.
and if tolkien wrote them nobody would hold him in such high regard rn
the newer versions are excellent as well the guy voicing them  his first name is phil  is great and does all the voices well. it also has the music and sound effects from the movie.
@dave roach  yes  phil dragash does an excellent unabridged and dramatized reading of Lord of the rings using sound effects and music from the jackson films. highly recommend. its free  just do a web search.
it doesnt matter if owning just a portion of the licenses  or all of them  itstill holds relations and foundations between each other  for it is all of the same world. if changing the portion of license and lore that you do have ownership over  then it is no longer from the same world and license  but something different and oftentimes corrupted  especially if done without respect and focus of the original story and lore.
if you saw the vid on the official channel  you ll find lots of fans commented with tolkien s quote about evil cant create but only destroy. they wrote it in different languages as well. that got me chuckled.
miriel wont be named miriel at that time. she would be ar-zimraphel because her cousin ar-pharazon married her without her consent so that he could become king. he renamed her because miriel is an elven name and numenor during that time hates elves so they use adunaic instead.
just wanted to say how great I think you are doing.....between this channel and your twitter account -- im inspired by your voice in these unprecedented times. keep it up.
personally I hope that the gaming  journalists  stay on strike forever.
so halbrand keeps galadrials rage in check  its a good thing there s a man to keep her in her place.  lol
dear tolkein lotr fans my thoughts and prayers are with you in these trying times. may peace find you soonsincerely an anime manga asian cinema fan of 20  years also  a for effort on those name pronunciations  melonie. lolol
I just discovered your channel and yes I binge watched all of your videos. Im glad you exist
Im somewhat new to your channel  I discovered you through your podcast with the critical drinker.  I do wonder something  though  I do apologize if this is something you ve grown weary of answering or isn t your thing  but if you could own the real world guns of any gun in the tomb raider franchise  movies  games  comics  etc.  which ones would they be  lets say for this hypothetical gun laws dont and youre as loaded as lara    should none come to mind  what loadout would you have her equipped with if you were at the helm of deciding what she looks like or what equipment she has or the contents of her arsenal  would you give her guns from other games like dante s pistols or solid snakes guns or some custom made guns that are embellished with a design befitting her  or do you have some other real world guns that would be cool for her to rock in some fan made re-make title
it would be cool to see you and rainbow dave do a video together. dude knows everything about the history of middle earth.
they sure have messed up  lor I stillwont see this whenever it comes out.thank you  melonie for putting out another wonderful video. I  the original lor movies.takecare melonie
melonie you rock! I really like your views on things. I especially like how you put a Bible verse in every video.
showrunners   we re not contradicting the lore. proceeds to contradict the lore.
galadriel s power comes from her knowledge and wisdom  not from her physical strenght
how are they addressing the pre-existing relationship between gil-galad and the numenorians  itseems like they are pretending he wasn t the one who establishes the alliance between elves and men  and are instead giving that role to galadriel. so they strip her of what makes her special  wisdom skill in magic  and give her the role of other main characters  and then dont get why fans are upset
almost to 23k! killin it mel
its incredible that the stories tolkien taught us about corruption and evil are happening to his own work. luckily the roherrim of fans ride to fight this corruption
wait  what  galadriel wasnt rescued from a ship wreck and taken anywhere. the ships were lit on fire by feanor and his sons as part of the kinslaying. then galadriel led her people across the frozen northlands and straight to the gates of the dark Lord himself. galadriel was born the year of the trees in the undyling lands before the first age. she had no major role in any wars in the first age. she never led the  northern armies . in the second age she was dealing with forming her lands  lothlorien. planting the malorn trees. dealing with the 3 rings. she was never a great general of armies. come on. did they even read the sillmarillion  or the war of the jewel or any appendicies  also  honestly the best stories tolkien made were during the first age. turin turambar  beren and luthien  morgoths killing of the trees  all the most major battles..... second age was a sleeper really.
I had my first pound of beef jerky!   yes  but what about second pound of beef jerky    and yes thats a mod on a Lord of the rings quote.  d
great video! more lotr cringe content please
definitely surprising to see.
this is why I have come to have three separate options on entertainment content.1  one on literature.2  one on media content.3  one on how well the literature and media content are similar to each other.for this Lord of the rings show I will hold final judgement on it until I watch it. but from what I have seen   heard so far the similarity of it and existing literature does not look like it will score well for me. even with that I still may like the show for what it is and enjoy it a lot  entertainment wise. but I have to wait and see.there are a lot of movies that do not follow the books well that end up being good  at least to me.I will use the Lord of the rings   hobbit movies as a quick example here. they are missing some things from the literature but they are close enough that I do not give them a  f  in similarity. I d give lotr a  b    hobbit a  c  in that category.I love the movies even though I know they did not completely follow the books   some stuff from the books was not even in them  and they even added stuff. but I give them both a  a   in entertainment.Im just hoping that this lotr show is good enough to give them a good grade in entertainment as I value that more over similarity between literature   media.but like I said earlier it is not looking good for that area so my grade for that part may be low   yet I can still really like it.Im keeping my fingers crossed.
the history of ar-pharazon as related by the article  in contradiction to that which amazon seems to be going with  i.e. making up  is essentially correct.
pork steaks have been a life saver for my wife and I on keto. we can get really good pork steaks for around 4 dollars a pound and we grill them over charcoal rubbed with our super-hot pepper blend  reapers  ghost chilI  scorpion peppers etc . when I eat ribeyes or pork steaks I can feel the energy boost from all the natural fat.
hey melonie I love your tattoos on your arms  last year I did my for the first time a lotr tattoo just want to ask will you make maybe one day a video telling us what does your tattoos mean what are they  like from a movie  games etc ... when did you make them.
those changes are terrible. there were no elves on numenor. not visiting the pro-elf reign of the previous king was a reason why the king s men faction could rule supreme and was able to persecute the traditionalist pro elf faction so relatively few remained.
my favorite characters are gimlI and legolas because their banter between the two s about how many kills they can achieve over the other.
you need to stream a lotr trilogy watch party on release day.
we dont have the rights to stories in the 2nd age  show takes place in 2nd age  my response   oh boy
have they forgotten celeborn. or they may have decided to delete it because it does not fit into the galadriel warrior.
there s other parts of middle earth that haven t been explored  you could ve easily made people of color those characters and kept everything cohesive of what we ve seen with the movies!
I have no idea what this video was about. I just laughed every time you struggled to read  numenorians . lol
I still cant get over the fact the lady dwarf doesnt have a beard
its a hard pass for me! Im reading the novels
I love how all these youtubers keep referencing boundingintocomics but they dont ever come to us   fellowshipoffans   the actual source. as far as the quick twitter search you did and found nerdrotics reply to us about no  great  characters  the gent in question said there weren t many  grey  characters. which was cleared up in that exact tweet thread you showed on video.
I could see g as a warrior  brash  easy to anger. yes in her 20s  30s  40s  maybe in her 50s. not in her 1800s or so.
nothing really to comment on the rings of power other than that it gets worse the more we find out  but I have a couple points on some prior videos comments of the day.going back to the de-feminization of lara croft  if you dont know who alex zedra is I think she perfectly embodies the strong curvy badass chick youre looking for. she was the headliner female operator in one of the somewhat recent cod games  think she even did some lara croft cosplay. big fan of firearms  she also twitch streams if thats your thing. she s worth checking out if there s another piece on this subject.on one of today s comments  the quality of medical recreational is at an all time high  no pun intended. the states figured out they could make bank by regulating sales. they dont really interfere with producers  other than regulating dosages   harmful production methods aren t used. its far safer these days than buying cartel grown stuff from the past  now that the industry isn t cloak   dagger they ve been free to make huge strides. I used to do it for  lets say a long time  but decided to just stop almost a year ago now. my attitudes haven t changed but Im just like Im good for now. oh  and like the only good radio station  90s alternative indie  in my state is fully sponsored by various medical dispensaries. its awesome.
by this point in middle earth galadriel was already old.  she spent a great deal of time being friends with and learning from the wise and powerful maia  melian.  she learned much of using her power and also of wisdom  foresight  and  yes   patience.  amazon seems to think a young foolish galadriel is a great thing. they are wrong.
paraphrase    never go woke  never compromise . . . not even in the face of armageddon!
hey melonie  thanks to your videps  I started carnivoure on the 1st of march.I alreadly lost 1.6 kilosa hint for people who have headaches or nuasea  eat liver  liver is the only organ meat with abundance of vit c.
I love how many book readers who used to trash the lor movies now are saying how much they loved them .
did you know what happened to cyberpunk 2077 when its developed said fingers crossed
thats what Ive been planning too! it really bothers me when people are like  I ll probably watch it  the show  cause it looks cool just to see how dumb it is  hate views are still views  and are still contributing support
@abigail white  agree 100 . hate views are still views.
efforts were made
thank you for the comment  I will be sure to look into you guys at fellowshipoffans next time I talk about middle earth stuff
@melonie mac go boom  thank you    and we will share your videos in our discord
example
peter jackson s cast was perfect. although I would have liked to see Christopher lee as gandalf instead  knowing tolkien promised the role to him. dont forget to leave a like and go boom!
day 2 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.great video  as always. love your basedness. keep up this energy!
the beef jerky from the last video has inspired me to invest in the equipment!
there are no words for how much of cluster flop this is going to be  I hope amazon loses its butt on this one.
hey melonie  this is a little off topic but Im a graphic artist and drew a quick classic  ie  not built like a 12 year old boy lol  lara croft on my down time. I tried posting a link but it doesnt seem to work in the comments here.
why  when you have such an empty era with which to make your own story  would you choose to change what is written   its like they want us to see galadriel differently.  maybe her reserved demeanor and faerie-like representation offended someone.  putting on the ring nenya and wearing it for a time would ve conceivably changed galadriel  making her seem more distracted and removed like she is portrayed by cate blanchett. but it looks like they have taken it too far and now Im worried they re going to make elves exactly the same as men  just with pointy ears.
amazon spent  250 million for the rights to make rings of power and the show has an estimated  462 million budget for the first season and a  1 billion budget for five seasons total. amazon literally cant afford for this to bomb but they seem to be doing what joker did in the dark knight and burning a huge pile of money. I guess they re sending a message lol.
jeff bezos said  I want a  game of thrones  but make the whole thing like the last season of  game of thrones .
amazon should never be trusted with anything that has the title of Lord of the rings at all
whew makes u appreciate the hobbit trilogy now dont it
I have never gotten through any of tolkien s books  but I eatch youtube videos and find the lore fascinating. I would recommend men of the west as my go-to for lotr lore.thatsaid  a lot of you need to get more familiar with galadriel from the silmarillian. she s kind of a bad guy. Im not saying amazon is not royally screwing up her character  but those you talking about how wise and angelic she is are way off. she teamed up with the worst elf ever  feanor  and openly defied the valar  basically archangels  purely out of jealous  pride  and lust for power. when galadriel says after turning down the ring  I passed the test   this is because she was basically banned from valinor  elf heaven  until she overcame her evil nature.
I stopped reading the books about where the second movie ends. thats not where the book ends though. and I was reading the books before the movies came out so was just happenstance that it ended up that way.
climbing with armor ...   laughs in shadow of war
Im looking forward to every future video.
to hell with amazon s anti-fanfic.
amazon is ruining this big time   so pharazon is now the advisor and miriel is the king queen   in the book the king is actually pharazon even though  he is not the rightful king  and miriel is actually his cousin  and he married her forcefully so he could usurp the throne of numenor.
melonie getting swole! those arm cannons are gonna go boom!
I asked my buddy the other day if he would ever try and f    with galadriel  as depicted in the peter jackson films. he responded  no   and when I asked why he replied  because I d probably end up dead  she looks dangerous.  case and point  galadriel requires zero improvement  her power is just short of Godly.
technically elves with innate ability dont have to respec to multiclass  they grow up with their natural magic  they can choose to be warriors or whatevs  and when they get older and stop fighting they still have innate ability. but could possibly still headshot an orc with a bow at a half kilometer.
hey mel I just want to say that I like the short dude gimlI from the movie of lotr bc he was able to fight with the army even though of his size that he could kick butt. anyway if I was his size that I would have a duty of protecting the castle and be a kings best man and keep the castle safe from evil enemies and evil monsters too  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you bout that and tell you that I properly see the new rings of power movie to see how it is but if I see it and dont like it then I will not buy the movie when it comes out on dvd  ok mel. anyway have a great evening and good night at home with your pets mel.
Christopher lee as gandalf would gave been great to see. but ian mckellen as gandalf did an amazing  job.  the roles reversed would be interesting  too. didn t know lee was promised by tolkien  though.  he nailed sarumen though.
lee had aged out of the role  though. he wasn t physically up to all the shenanigans gandalf had to do anymore. had he been younger  I dont doubt he would have been gandalf.
it wasn t perfect. but they got a lot right vis-a-vis casting.
sweeet! enjoy!
she definitely had ambition to rule lands of her own...and when questioned by melian the maiar  queen of doriath  she was secretive and not forthcoming. I would say she had a  rebellious  nature  not evil.
was she a butch warrior  though
@jade runner 2049  for sure not. if anything  she considered being a warrior beneath her. like I said  Im not claiming amazon isn t screwing this up. Im just saying a lot of people seemed to have this incorrect view of who galadriel is as a character.
unfortunately a lot of the tolkien lore youtube channels have outed themselves as shills with this amazon show. men of the west  nerd of the rings  etc. they re all making excuses for or even promoting this amazon trash to one extent or another.
I cancelled my amazon account due to this shit  more people need to do the same or they will just carry on with this shit!  too many people are happy to give them their money as it make their life easier.
that being said  if you ask the tolkien estate for the chance to make a show set in middle-earth  and they say  sure just dont make it about anything ever actually detailed in the history of middle-earth  maybe you should have tried a show using dragonlance  or the legend of drizzt  or death gate cycle etc.
damn the disrespect to pippin he redeemed himself and saved gandalf life from a orc and saved faramir he a real mvp
Im 99  sure amazon s contract states they are not allowed to contradict any of tolkiens canonical writings. not just the books they have the rights to use. they cant use the  we cant use that books so we can contradict it  excuse.
no Im not gonna support amazon ruin my beloved fantasy amazon   but we have gandalf s nude scene where do in subscribe
its okay melonie  I have a hard time saying sirloinamazon too
galadriel s rage lol.  they sure are trying hard aren t they
nice great job show them that everyone has the right to speak the truth whether they like it or not
they tried to fix tolkien s mysoginism by making scenes that are more mysoginists than the book. how the hell they managed to do that!  they are not doing m riel and galadriel any favor. they are making them like inmature men tropes. galadriel wished power that is why she left aman  but she wasn t reckless and raged.
I think I ll binge too.
I just dont trust adaptations of stories or rings of fan fic
waiting for just some guy s response to this.
nice verse of the day.  fitting.
I almost feel like you could do one video a week on your diet.  as a how-to and then make a playlist.
did you just diss pippin   no second breakfast for you!
one way this could be good is if it is a taming of the shrew story.  but  alas  thats a pipe dream.
the more one thinks about it   why the hell did amazon do this series based on Lord of the rings . they could have done a new fantasy dungeons and dragons type series which could have been potentially good .yet they have taken books which has a lore which is very specific  which tolkien himself said it was for england   not even british but for england . thats why at school kids in england read the hobbit and later on the Lord of the rings .they even had an audio radio readings of the books for people to listen at homes as well as schools . so when s country like the united states takes this material they should some respect for the lore . peter jackson as a man from new zealand understood this and managed to convince the american studios to be true to the lore as much as possible . americans created dungeons and dragons so they should make a series about that . the reason why tolkien wrote these books for england was because he believed england didn t have a medieval lore   he mention the king arthurian legends with the holy grail was formidable but not really specific for england   he s probably right there . this series by amazon is probably going to be a disaster as they underestimate how many people have read the books
ringpieces of power.
middle earth was meant to be a mythology for the anglo saxons.  tolkein said he was jealous of the odyssey  iliad  and aenid. as well as norse mythology.therefore middle earth is explicity european  just as mulan is explicity chinese  zatoichI is explicity japanese  etc...
Im not even going to be giving amazon prime s lotr series the time of day. I ll just watch the peter jackson films instead. lol
melian never raised no spoilt brat.
lol I just watched your cowboy video and you must have filmed them both on the same day but you tried to trick us by taking that black shirt off and just wearing the green one in the cowboy vid.  I know you told us already you film these videos in the same day but I just thought it was funny to notice the shirt switcharoo .
but its just fanrssy!!!!!! defender s of this shitshow
@dimitrI warchief  the response to that is   well if nothing matters in fantasy  why not give the orcs machine guns
zatoichI  nani
@vivienne koo  zatoichI is japan s longest running film series. now image they remake it but half the entire cast is black for no reason.
thank you for the Bible reading
please  galadriel is a powerful mage.. do not turn her into a soldier amazon . really cool that youre a carnivore we re growing. I also tend to just eat ground beef on a budget.
galadriel reveals her lineage  why in the world would she need to do that. rolls eyes and they are going to lock her away where you say    ooookay.
thats ground beef.... dang gettin yoked! dont forget to like and go boom
love it. go boom boom
you need to sit down and read lotr and the honbit. they are fantastic.
exposing amazon s equality farce   from a non-racist poc perspective  Im brown-asian.a lot of poc are not really happy with the casting..  not due to lore issues but because they feel cheated if youre  amazon  proclaiming yourself as a champion of equality by citing that you ve cast diverse actors.. then you have to do it right and have some of the major real tolkien characters as diverse actors too.. you cant just have some new random side characters specially created for the sake of diversity and then make tall claims.. either you do it right and go all the way.. or you dont do it at all.. this half baked pretentious attempt only for the sake of cheap publicity and brand image is insulting to everyone.. and does more harm than good even from a representation point of view..imagine the following conversation between amazon and a poc kid  who as per amazon always wanted his fav characters to look like him.. to be honest we poc aren t this insecure and we ve had amazing poc actors that have graced the screen for a longgg time now - but anyway read on .amazon  we value all races equally and our casting will be done not on the basis of colour of the skin but on acting merits. so we will have diverse actors playing tolkien characterspoc kid   excited  .. yay so that means I ll finally get to see my fav heroes looking like meee !!amazon  no darling.. thats a stretch.. we have to say we re progressive to the media.. but all we can actually do for you is create random new characters that you or any tolkien fan over decades hasn t heard of nor cares about.. and we ll assign poc actors to those.. and pat ourselves on the back and call it a day..poc kid  ugh wtf tokenism to satisfy brand image in the market.. is worse than actual racism..this is like amazon throwing left over scraps to the poc community and portraying the poc community as insecure while projecting the amazon corporation as the savior of poc people.. lolhaving said this.. I feel bad for the poc actors  because of the backlash .. but am also super thrilled for the actors to be a part of middle earth and really think the actors are amazing and sophia will pull it off easily and do a great job of bringing the character of disa to life..  if the story is well written representation is imp.. but imagine reading a story to a kid.. then instead of having proper representation.. you just shoehorn an entire new character and assign a poc to it.. what s that telling the kid..  youre telling  the kid that he she will never be good enough to be an actual beloved character from their beloved story but a random made up one  like telling the kid he is only good enough to be a cheap second copy of the his actual heroes.. is that the message we want to give kids..  really    wow
they should call the show the fellowship of the woke because this show is going to be a huge woke mess
to be clearby the second age galadrial was a leader of a nation that had been established in the years of the trees  roughly 14-15 thousand lunar years ago  by the time of the second age.you dont imprison leaders of countries without expecting a war to happen
dangit  I just bought a teaser pack from carnivore crunch  and I couldn t remember where I had seen your code... its on your all your socials link... oh well  maybe next time.
if its been a decade of destroying your favorite gaming outlets  imo it ceases to be a favorite or an outlet. why would you go back to kotaku because they fired their staff  they were cool with attacking their customer audience base for a decade  no thanks. I prefer the commentary of the individual youtuber vs any corporatist outlet like kotaku
people seem to be too defensive about devils lettuce imo. cant really question or criticize it without being attacked.

ok  you made a colossal mistaken in this one. aragorn is the greatest of all time.
my gramps did ground beef jerky all the time.  its easier all around  and wont give you some manly jaw gains.
there is no curse in the language of elves or men that adequately describes the evil of amazon.
why do people call Gods green gift the  devils lettuce  evil cant create  only corrupt!

people should look into hemp oil as opposed to weed  but obviously do research . hemp oil doesnt have thc  or any of the drug parts. its basically good for joints and pain and all sorts of things. I personally cant have marijuana because of the effects it had on my psyche.
ahh  see  you get it!
what nation are youreferring to
@tar-elenion maranwe  lothlorien
@tar-elenion maranwe  and to be clear galadrial formed lothlorien she s always been its queen.
@tbd - formerally hardlight in response to a movie proposal in which galadriel and lorien are referred to    a splendid sight. it is the home of galadriel. . . an elvenqueen. tolkien said  she is not in fact one. letter 210also  after the disaster in moria  in the year 1980  and the sorrows of l rien  which was now left without a ruler  for amroth was drowned in the sea in the bay of belfalas and left no heir   celeborn and galadriel returned to l rien  and were welcomed by the people. there they dwelt while the third age lasted  but they took no title of king or queen  for they said that they were only guardians of this small but fair realm  the last eastward outpost of the elves. ut   history of galadriel and celebornas the story developed  lorien was a realm before galadriel ever went there. its  king was first  amdir malgalad  followed by his son amroth.galadriel was not even in middle-earth in the years of the trees.also  elves dont reckon time in lunar years. for the times concerned with  there may have been rulers before him but tolkien does not state this.
@tbd - formerally hardlight  odd claim  since I actually quoted tolkien..  unlike  say  you.by the way  annatar did not give a ring  to galadriel.had youread lotr you would have known that celebrimbor made and hid the three  celebrimbor was aware of him  sauron   and hid the three which he had made  and there was war  and the land was laid waste  and the gate of moria was shut.  for in the day thatsauron first put on the one  celebrimbor  maker of the three  was aware of him  and from afar he heard him speak these words  and so his evil purposes were revealed. lotr  council of elrondwere you even somewhat familiar with tolkien you would know thatsauron had no hand in making the three and never touched them  the elves of eregion made three supremely beautiful and powerful rings  almost solely of their own imagination  and directed to the preservation of beauty  they did not confer invisibility. but secretly in the subterranean fire  in his own black land  sauron made one ring  the ruling ring that contained the powers of all the others  and controlled them  so that its wearer could see the thoughts of all those that used the lesser rings  could govern all that they did  and in the end could utterly enslave them. he reckoned  however  without the wisdom and subtle perceptions of the elves. the moment he assumed the one  they were aware of it  and of his secret purpose  and were afraid. they hid the three rings  so that not even sauron ever discovered where they were and they remained unsullied. letter 131 hence the making of the rings  for the three rings were precisely endowed with the power of preservation  not of birth. though unsullied  because they were not made by sauron nor touched by him  they were nonetheless partly products of his instruction  and ultimately under the control of the one. letter 144
@tar-elenion maranwe  going to a place that has his letters and copying them verbatum without actually understanding them is not quoting the man.its called cherry picking misappropriation.I on the other hand have given a semi-detailed analysis of galadrial  the creation of lorien  the journey of the elves  the destruction of them and even a brief on the war of wrath.this includes the choosing of the great ring s bearers of which most were lost in the chaos of the conquoring sauron did in the second age and the chaos of the early third age.celebrimbor was the man who taught anatar Lord of gifts the craft of ring making and was there while he was making the 13 rings of power.all the elves knew the trechary of anatar the instant he put on the one. three rings for the elven kings under the skyseven for the dwarf Lords in the halls of stonenine for mortal men doomed to dieone for the dark Lord on his dark throne.ash nazg durbatul k ash nazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatul kagh burzum-ishI krimpatul.darburgz-ishImaka gulshu darulu. thatsays  one ring to rule them allone ring to find themone ring to bring them alland in the darkness bind themin the the land of mordor where shadows lie. in the black speech of mordor  a corrupted form of elvish created by the torture and enslavement of the elves who were tortured into the monstrous orcs by morgoth  I d say you ve been btfo d but you infiltrating manipulative fake fans never realise how wrong you are and continue screeching.so I ll simply say this evil does not know how to create  only how to corrupt you lack the light of illuvitar  the flame of anor.all you have is the flame of udun. go back to it and your corrupt broken Lord.
@tbd - formerally hardlight  your  semi-detailed analysis  is simply fan-fiction  until you can support it with actual statements from tolkien  preferably the points I have addressed rather than irrelevant statements you are trying to introduce .you know  like I did  contradicting various of your claims.and as to this   celebrimbor was the man who taught anatar Lord of gifts the craft of ring making and was there while he was making the 13 rings of power. that would be a no. annatar taught the  craft of ring making  to celebrimbor and the elven-smiths of eregion. you may want to brush up on basic mathematics  as well as what tolkien actually says about his mythology. 3 7 9 1 does not equal 13 and of the great rings thatsauron had a hand in making 7 9 does not equal 13 either.
no worries! for future reference  code mac
@melonie mac go boom  I tried boom... and then stopped  cause I didn t want to lock up the system.
forreal lol!
there were a lot of others I didn t mention  my point here was just making a joke about pippin lol
@melonie mac go boom  still epic fail missing the best character lol
would be fantastic having better hobit or series of lotr with things jackson didn t include. Imean they had rights for it... we have this pathetic nonsense instead.
I cant think of any pj s lotr main character that isn t great. its the opposite of what ve seen from the rings of power so far.
I have add so I never read the books. I have listened to the audio books countless
if you think its good that the gov. made marijuana legal just watch kingsman  the golden circle. they tell you exactly what they do ahead of time.
and legolas. what about him  and p ...  frown  ... and legolas!!!!   lol
the parallel with lara croft is retconning beautiful  strong women into yasskween girlbosses. I wouldn t say new galadriel has been androgynized  but the current  progressive  stance seems to be that female characters need to be made more masculine to be compelling. if you disagree  youre deemed a misogynist. also  characters like galadriel and lara were never meant to be  relatable. they were meant to be aspirational. media  folklore  legend and even religion are full of powerful  aspirational  unrelatable men. why is it wrong for women to also have those kinds of figures
for the commenter asking about carnivore diet and tips  start hunting if you can. get a rifle  get a hunting license  buy a deer tag and take a week off work paid vacation if its available and go hunt. much cheaper and the quality of meat is 1000k  better.
according to tolkiens letters he was very much against all this woke shit
I liked the books  I loved the lotr movies  not the hobbit .  Im not bothered by amazon messing everything up -- the hobbit movies were terrible.  Im mostly just curious why they didn t start a brand new fantasy series  game of thrones was 95  new viewers  never even heard of the books .  Imean  there s so little sword and sorcery stuff  and a big budget seems like it really draws the crowd.  they could have made super bucks  instead of driving away most of the fans and just getting the people that would ve watched anything  anyway  if even just to watercooler.
screw the rings of power series  read  the book of five rings  instead
oh wow  this video randomly got suggested to me because of lotr  and I just started carnivore diet  not for the first time  a couple of days ago.budget carnivore  or any carnivore diet  you need a lot of saturated fat for calories. there s something like 900 calories in a stick of butter  I use a half of stick of butter on my giant omelette in the morning and when I cook meat at night. butter comes out to like  1 a stick  thats half your calories for the day for  1.lots of fat  particularly butter  will make you use the toilet if you overdo it though.
you only skimmed through the original books  . that immediately disqualifies your opinion on anything by tolkien. are you aware jackson butchered the hobbit   lotr with his trilogies  of course not. the reality is most filmmakers only loosely base their material on the original works  so for people to be up in arms about the new show is just dumb. watch or not  people really have no basis to talk shit  especially if they aren t even familiar with the original author material
what about gimley !
the numa numa-orians
the way you are mentioning these names sounds like youre speaking the sims language.
amazon should stick to selling books rather than trying to rewrite them.
people need to relax a little  if you want a show to be exactly the same as the source material  then why do you need it  just go to the source material and read that instead. new shows are supposed to iterate with new ideas  sometimes they work sometimes they dont. people hating on shows even before they come out seems so dumb
I rather watch my Lord of the rings dvds and I simp for those elf women yeahyeyeyeye !
lotr scholar here.  galadriel was never in numenor.  galadriel never led soldiers.  if anyone has questions  I ll gladly answer them.
would this have worked better if this was celebrian instead of her mother
finally someone got the joke
bahahaha
when did the first age begin
@tar-elenion maranwe  there s basically a little variation with the works and ones interpretation of them mostly due to the usage of two different dating systems solar years and valian years   meaning one has to work with conversions if one doesnt want to use both systems at the same time to express the duration of the first age.if you go with the version in which itstarts with the awakening of the elves at cuivI nen it begins roughly 4300  solar  years before the rising of the sun and the last six centuries take place after the rising of the sun  the latter six centuries are often misinterpreted as being the first age  but they are merely a small part of it . or using both dating systems  450 valian years starting at the valian year 1050 and then another 590 solar years the solar years being the later six centuries .if you take the broad definition it includes everything going back to the creation of arda  it d would mean the first age lasted around 48000-49000 years  with 48500 often being seen as the most likely duration.
@mr.  well  yes  although if you take tolkien s later work on time and ageing the first age is much longer than that presented in the annals. but yes  the final ca. 600 before the end of the war of wrath are often misinterpreted as the first age.according to the cuivienyarna  the first elves awoke at twilight  morrowdim  just before dawn and sunrise  consistent with lotr and the hobbit .
oh well. it only gets worse.
for the algorithm!

at this point  amazon is just insulting the fans... its really bad. marketing 101  dont insult your audience.
slight mispronunciation  silmarillion rhymes with nathan fillion.
incest is ok in got but thankfully not in the tolkien universe  Im good with that.
melonie I would encourage you to do yourself a favor and go back to the books.  not as a criticism  but it is so much better to have that tool in your belt when you talk about lotr.  hell  I know many people who read the trilogy every single year  and might add in the hobbit   or silmarillion as well!  Im not one of those  but I am probably past due to read them again
los ojetes del poder
they ruined star trek  star wars and Lord of the rings franchise with their agendas. what is the definition of insanity  some people say they are motivated by money  I dont think that is true anymore.
hey to anyone here that prays could you guys   gals please say a quick prayer for my family we are hoping to move somewhere much  much nicer and we will find out today if it will work or not.thank you.
0 40 well why tf aren t u reading them lol
the ring of poo-ers
a secret pet peeve of mine is when I hear people  who say they ve read it  say  sim a lair ee on
star trek has always had an underlying progressive left-wing message. sorry if youre a star trek fan who doesnt want to hear that but its true.
@finrod felagund  thats gaslighting. we know what it was before  and we know what these people are doing to it now.
just prayed for y all
@melonie mac go boom  thank you  I ll let you know how it turns out
@melonie mac go boom  so we all talked and we decided that barring some calamity we will be moving the whole clan out of our state to somewhere much  much nicer for us  thank you to anyone that prayed for us  it always helps  and a special thanks to the head boomer herself thanks for the prayers
let s see......masculine galadrielfeminine elrondtoken minority charactersbutcher the original Lord.... I cant wait to see this fail
sauron...wasn t a man - like he s not human wtf
cringe of the woke
this galadriel only shares a name with the books and the two trilogies ..and thats it. what a disgrace for amazon to destroy this character.
this is going to be horrible just like amazon s  not  wheel of time.
they do not have the rights to any of the actual source material. this is nothing more than fan fiction off of a crib notes summary.
amazon buys the rights to make a tv series of Lords of the rings and the hobbit. amazon chooses to make a series about events they dont have the rights to so they have to wing it  add some black elves with short hair and black female dwarfs without beards and then they have the audacity call the tolkien fans racists. sigh.
your mic is peeking. not hating  just an observation.
I didn t realise they didn t have the rights to alot of the works. doing this series without rights to the silmarillion when u are basing it thousands of years before the movies is so dumb
another man turned into a beta male another woman turned into the focus and the one with power.  and no great  characters in Lord of the ring film wtf.
ive never seen so much butchering of names and just general  reading
this show should be thrown into the fire.
if they haven t got the rights to the silmarillion then why are the stories they are writing based  very loosely  from that book  they are full of lies and excuses.
work on your smacking  you ll do alright.
I would love to see lgbtq transgender black galadriel! this current one is boring and unrelatable.
Im I late
who is doing this amazon  right  they re no good. imo amazon s the expanse wasn t as good and felt rushed. they re not great for original content in the slightest
how are you gonna do my boI pippin so dirty definitely unsubbing after such blasphemy.
why do you constantly smack your lips together
wow  in the future could you please read the article and learn how to pronounce the words before you make the video  I dont think that modicum of effort is asking too much from someone who makes their living with this engagement.
if you dont even know the subject why bother  I grew up in real england with the entirety of that world  35 years before peter jackson made a.. great attempt. bbc radio dramatisation version.
