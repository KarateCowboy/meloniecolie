zoe  this is what s the problem with the world. also zoe  sure  I ll take the role of catwoman.
she hates these characters for the same reason that any feminist hates  these characters are cute  beautiful  do not humiliate men and are really strong. telling a feminist that these are good characters is like pouring water on a witch.
so much more respect for robert now.  zoe can go kick rocks.  she has no idea how much those characters mean to so many people and how invaluable those characters are despite being beautiful.
tifa is more of a monk fighter if she had a character class. tifa is the girl that drops everything to take care of cloud even when the world is literally falling apart. then works with him to reconstruct his psyche. stays loyal to him always feels a need to do her part and  is beyond thankful for the people in her life and the things they do for her.some of the reasons people think she s the best.aerith heals  she s also the best magic user so she also nukes stuff into oblivion. she sacrifices everything for the world. and possibly even more. thinks of everyone before her.both girls do this despite living through loss and hardships.now that I think of it I can see why celebs like zoe would feel animosity towards female character like that.
zoe kravitz   ugh  poor women  we have to heal everyone  and just like thatshe s   s on every woman who s ever worked in a medical profession.facepalms through own head
its great to see someone genuinely excited about something  and become more animated when they talk about it. zoe s reaction kind of had me popping a blood vessel from anger. thats how people lose their fire and creativity  which I feel is something thatshould be protected and celebrated.
zoe  continues to rant aerith for being  just a healer  and tifa for being  a pretty little thing  and explains that this is the problem of the world.meanwhile the character she plays  steals for fun and tries to seduce batman everytime they meet.
I like how robert is not afraid or shamed to share his experience and passion for ff7. much respect for him having to deal with zoe crazy self during filming. I can only imagine what he went through.
honestly  Im totally ok with games being  uncool  especially around air-headed celeb types.our fandoms going mainstream was neat for about 5 minutes but then yourealize that it is a net loss for everyone involved.
I love how robert just keeps going without missing a beat. what a chad.
from a story point of view  healing is one of the themes in ff7. in that I say both aerith and tifa perform an act of healing. aerith heals the world and brings back a sense of spiritual enlighthenment that was lost to the world drowned in commercialism  modernisim  industry anything regarding materialism and coporate greed which harmed the planet while tifa s act is more on a personal level  she healed cloud s mind and saved his soul from being lost. without such act which she did out of sheer love and loyalty  cloud would of never come back  the world would of lost its hero.so yeah its more than just aerith healing brusies and cuts and tifa being sexy and kicking ass  healing is also within the psyche.
of the two  tifa was my favorite. not because of her looks  dont get me wrong  that helped   but because of her character. she is a strong woman who can protect herself. however  because she perceives him as her hero  due to childhood events  she wants to be saved and to be protected by him even though she doesnt need it. this feeling evolves as the game goes on into a more mutual support of one another and develops into a legitimate relationship to help make her such a great character.
Ive been gaming for...  30 years now  and  to date  the scene with aeris and sephiroth  wont spoil it  go play the original ffviI  is still one of my most impactful memories.  it completely changed not only how I looked at video games  but everything.  sometimes things happen and there is literally nothing you can do about it  no matter how many times you search in your menus for that phoenix down.
the image of aerith being the dainty healer and tifa being the tough brawler is only skin deep. looking deeper into their personalities you see that aerith is extraverted  emotionally secure and courageous. tifa is caring but quite neurotic and anxious. my point being that 3-dimensional personalities were already written into them in 1997  neither are stereotypes.
I generally dont care about celebs or their opinions about 25 yr old videogames  but zoe griping about tifa s short skirt when she is playing catwoman of all characters  is pure hypocrisy.
in wow  two classes of characters get invited all the time to dungeon raids- they are usually healers and tanks. damage dealers are usually the last to be invited.  so if aerith was in wow  she would be a valuable character for a group . zoe dont know what the hell she s talking about.
if it wasn t for the healer we would be dead.
zoe kravitz who s literally made her career on wearing short shirts. lol
aerith in the og just has a lot of magical stats and her limit breaks are mostly support and healing wind her iconic ability  but she can do offensive magic as well as the materia system allows customization. the same goes for remake except that you cannot really make aerith a physical dps in remake even if you want to because the materia system lacks materia boosts to that  and they extended the characters combat abilities to have them be more unique and play into their stereotypes. still  aerith can dish out much magical damage and not just heal.
5 15  I d love to be able to be a healer irl just keep making people laugh and smile
bahahaha
so.. is she hate herself
@peter h  she just wants to be part of the crowd.
@peter h  didn t she said  thatshe doesnt want men to find catwoman sexy.
my gosh thats so true xd xd
didn t cara delevingne say the same thing when suicide squad first came out  thatsuperhero shows objectifies women.....but she s the same that acted in shows where she was using her body as a marketing tool  !!
@iono vitalis  meanwhile ignores a chained naked thor. every mcu male hero has appeared shirtless but crickets from  feminists  on sexualization of men.
more importantly  these characters respect men. you dont see tifa challenging or questioning barret s leadership of the group. both tifa and aerith trust in cloud and his skills and they visibly feel more safe around him. this is interesting because they are strong themselves  but they chose to embrace their feminine energy and let it play out and let the men do their thing. in other words  their strenght reinforces their femininity as opposed to be a detriment to it like usually is the case with western female characters.
@astalth on  pouring holy water on witches can cause burn.
more like tossing holy water on a demon possessed person
@astalth on  if you look at thatscene afer they remove the witch and the duck you can see the scale on the duck side was heavier.
@rivershield  yep  both the men and women makes each other stronger in this game.shame feminists see this has weakness.
this could also be the reason.
plus  there are a lot of people that actually enjoy these characters who dont only think of them in a sexual way  so they are just genuinely likable characters and well-rounded. from cute  beautiful  fun  and cool. probably sets the standards too high for them. you dont see them bashing on the dudes in a  im superior  way but in a  ok now you are being silly. silly boys.  but also having their moments of vulnerability. nice to have that balance. sometimes feminists hate when women show any vulnerability since they have to be strong and flawless  but it just makes them a boring weight.
also... the whole don corneo sequence in the game is amazing. the difference between that and feminist takes on it  don corneo is a parody of a certain type of man  one that isn t good  which makes the  I ll rip em off  sentence awesome  because its two women who s asserting themselves over a predator. in a feminist take they would be doing that to some random dude who delivers pizza and was a sleaze just so the characters could be  strong don corneo just makes it feel so much more satisfying when they say  I ll smash em  especially since cloud is sort of just standing back and letting it happen.
yeah  aeris was super important to the party.  her limit breaks were the only thing that made some fights beatable.  then she dies.
they are video game characters. they shouldn t mean anything to anyone.
but they are some of the best characters. thats why they are so memorable.
watch his tenant interview- aerith was his  first love  lol.
@cobalt-snake  robert was clearly joking about that. he is known to lie in interviews all the time.
@cobalt-snake  holy shit  you actually bought into that bullshit. its been revealed that he trained in brazilian jiu jitsu for this role and changed his diet. and clips video photo evidence show that he s beefed up. you bought into lies from journalists that want clicks. seriously  do actual research before you make ignorant comments.
zoe needs a healer like tifa in her life.
monks rule!
brawler
it is hard for the self-absorbed  knowing a fictional character will forever be better than them
even more so in the cgI anime which still holds up. she s a support character there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
especially since in war time healers were considered more valuable than soldiers.bah  who is she to talk about it  all she does is play acting someone else  and her characters are not even inspirational to anyone.
all those hard working doctors and nurses... hope she never needs medical help...
looool I was in shock of her reaction but explaining the story in a vague way to a feminist would earn the same reaction I guess but if she was to sit down and watch a playthrough with him explaining point as they go along it would make much more sense to her  thats the problem with feminist they always come at thing like this from a negative stand point first rather then keeping and open mind about it.
lmao meanwhile tifa can smash walls and shit with her fists
as a dude that does stupid shit.... yeah I like  healers  they help me! apparently  if you have adhd you have a much higher chance of death.
anyone want to go through zoe s tweets  I d not be surprised if she bandwaggoned the  real superheros are the health care profrssionals  back in 2020.
does she even play the game.. tifa and aerith are amazing.. Imiss aerith..
@kiwI and some random stuff.  from the looks of itshe has never played the game.even I am new to the final fantasy 7 lore  but I still love these characters.
@the renegade player  looks like she doesnt play games  hence ignorant of the gaming trinity. plus her feminist killjoy attitude  making sure gaming pattison doesnt have nice things in that clip.
with henry cavill being such an out nerd  its a good time for pattison to share his gaming passion. it ll help build some relatability with fans  after that gq article created some division.
quite true. I wish geek culture never got the main stream
if celebs deem something uncool  99  its really cool.
100  this.
@furon brainiac66  people run towards something when a celebrity tells you to avoid it  who are they to talk.
@shaun jay  clearly it wasn t enough  apparently
yes sir   keep our games culture within our circles thats another part of hollywood making movies based on games  then normies think they are in know     robert being a gamer is cool he is allowed in.
Imiss when nerd was a pejorative
damm cloud is a lucky guy huh
tifa is afraid throughout all the early parts of ff viI og  and remake I guess  that if she confront cloud about his past and nibelheim being  false  she will lose him. since she lost more or less everything in her life  and loses everything she rebuilds  again  it is not strange thatshe wants to keep the only thing left from her childhood. it does not change that if she only spoke up ff viI would be vastly different. tifa just like the rest of ff viI cast is great because they aren t perfect  in fact kinda the opposite  and that makes them relatable.
@furon brainiac66  its the lack of nuance for me. because obviously  a woman being attractive automatically voids her ability to be a complex person with her open circumstances  motivations and aspirations xd they wont look any deeper than the surface physical level. you ll also notice this trend in the characters these clowns create. just surface level woke identifiers   he s black!    she s a lesbian!    he s bi!   and when you dig deeper  there s nothing interesting or compelling about the backstory or the characters themselves
@  kyu  plus the make up departments often try to make beautiful actress look ugly on screen to make insecure feminists feel better and to spread the message that they are already perfect how they are and its the world that needs to change for them.which is why I heard that in the wheel of time tv show you ve got two guys fighting over an generic girl has if she were a queen.how inspiring for woman.
heard a lot of people cried at that one. yes thats how well written she and the other characters are.
man that whole moment when you are cloud standing over her before the big moment really tying into the broken psyche that cloud has really had me broke as a kid. now at 31 it us one of the game moments that forever stayed in my mind.
I think I was like 11 or 12 when I played through that part  and I remember kept thinking to myself that couldn t be it  there has to be a way to bring her back.  however many years later  even after gameshark and mods I still couldn t bring her back
mate full-grown men cried when aerith dies  I am one of them.
her introduction scene in the movie involved her wearing a short skirt before she put on the catwoman suit. hypocrisy indeed.

tanks and healers have the greatest responsibility in the group  hence most people dont want to do it.
I remember one time I went to the bank and the teller was making small talk and asked what I did for a living  at the time  I told her I was in it - so then she goes  do you game on pc   - of which I said heck yeah - so she pulls out a business card and writes down her and her husband s elfquest  !!  usernames and gushed for the next 5 minutes with pride about her husband being a warrior cleric or something but thatshe was a healer and she loved nothing more than going on raids and being there to heal people so they could all be successful. I walked away with a feeling of respect for that random bank teller.  you could tell she had a kind heart too.
I was thinking the same thing. tanks  healers  fighters - the core of any combat squad in a computer game. each role is essential and valued. damage dealers are only less valued because there are so many of them and most players dont know how to synergise well with the rest of the team.
hell  in turn based rpgs a dedicated healer is borderline mandatory. the only reason why this isn t the case in ff7 is because of the materia system.
and she s not very attractive. I can see why she would see tifa as a threat lol
@sheepdog  she is absolutely gorgeous  youre tripping. but she has zero acting ability and will be the worst part of new batman
@paul smith  how right you were
no  she made her career on being born to a wealthy  well-connected  famous father.thats about it.
@krausewitz  preach
zoe is the kind of normie who despises and look down at nerds. robert gave a nerdy passionate short explanation. she cringe at his nerdiness. she s making a movie hyped mainly for comic nerds.
zoe kravitz has spoken out both sides of her mouth for her entire career.  she s willing to take the  sexy  roles  but then bashes anyone who dares to point it out.  robert pattison jumped up my list of respect  a little  because he knows ffvii.  she s probably mad as well because italians love tifa more than her.   s
as soon as zoe sighed  I would have told her   what  what s your problem  every single women playing ff7 remake says how beautiful is aerith and how sexy is tifa.
no mention of tifa being an actual badass monk job class . she is protective of cloud  goes out of her way to save him. tifa is best girl.
tifa is top tier waifu. who cares what zoe kravitz has to say
I d like to point out  that tifa was the sweetheart of the two. and kind of shy around cloud  at least a little. while aerith is the spunky  playful one. also tifa was a martial artist not a thief. tifa is best girl also.
excellent vod  mel! I always love seeing your verse of the day. go boom! I loved seeing robert s giddiness and passion for final fantasy vii. final fantasy is one of my top 10 fav video game franchises. tifa is my fav final fantasy girl and I had a huge childhood crush on her. I still crush on her  lol. ironic and hypocritical that zoe takes sexy roles but hates on sexy female characters  typical modern feminist  ugh.
I love playing healers in mmos  its fun to be so central and important to a group  with so much faux-pressure on you to keep the team alive during the mission.  I started playing healers back in swg and have done it in every mmo Ive played  since.
pattinson   I am batman! zoe   I am wet blanket
oh no a character who cantake care of herself yet has the ability to heal her friends and another character who is one of the strongest martial artists in the series  how will women ever recover.  eyeroll
thank you. as a guy I often see woman in media or in general scoffing at the things that make men happy  making them feel like they shouldn t like the things they do.  men do this too but as a guy I notice one side more than the other for obvious reasons  so seeing a woman being reasonable and level headed like yourself honestly give me some hope. I dont have much hope left in my life at my age but seeing someone like yourself makes me think there are people out there who get it.
as a huge final fantasy fan  it made me mad when she said just a healer for aerith or saying because she is a woman she is not important. if you know anything about ff7 or just final fantasy in general. you know that aerith is the last living ancient  so she is extremely important to the story and the reason cloud keeps going on.
tifa represents everything valuable in a persons personality. patience  loyalty  empathy  a sense of honor  selfless  and she s super hot to boot. I see why zoe would be intimidated
sure  tifa and aerith can be reduced to tropes. same with any other character from ff. same with basically any story. that doesnt mean there isn t value to them or that the story suffers because of it. look at kravitz. she fits right into a trope herself but that doesnt mean she s less of a person. it just means that her particular brand of person is kind of irritating.
never thought much about pattinson one way or another  but I loved this.  had no clue he was an ffviI fan.  itsounds like kravitz has no real context  but yeah  that kind of reaction just comes off as a total killjoy-type of thing.  final fantasy viI was a huge chunk of my childhood  so I ll always love it.
zoe  you just dont know  healers are awesome!!! without healers  we are all doomed...
when I first heard that twilight boy was cast as batman I was terrified when I heard him display a knowledge of the character that most fans of batman dont acknowledge I stopped calling him twilight boy other than to illustrate a point I think robert pattinson will be a good batman
catwoman is pretty similar to tifa in terms of sex appeal and kicking ass. only real difference is tifa is a through and through nice person. its so bizarre that a lot of women s response to women being depicted as kind  compassionate and feminine is to be repulsed by it. especially when men express interest.
side note  you dont have to choose.  you go on a date with aerith and in the gondola ride you totally bang  fireworks going off and everything.  then just before the final mission into the northern crater to defeat the big bad they land the highwind and everyone departs to think about whether they want to go through with it and return the next day.  however both cloud and tifa have nobody else  so they stay together at the highwind  all alone.  the next morning cloud awakens with tifa in his arms so you know what they did under the stars when left alone dont you   turns out cloud is a bit of a player.  once cloud and tifa return to the highwind everyone else is there waiting for them and tifa is mortified that they might have seen or heard them.  if you botch your dialogue choices up enough with aerith and tifa then you ll end up dating yuffie or barrett but will always spend the night with tifa before going into the northern crater.
zoe is probably one of those people that ques as heals then tries to heal everyone with bandages.
@sammysam7x  lol I guess people dont understand sarcasm do they   I better stick a   s  in there so no one else will get confused.
@npc Im knot hmmm  thats an interesting thought. how many people would cry and be a bit mentally scarred for life if zoe was the one deleted by sephiroth  would her theme song be remembered two decades later
funny thing about robert  beyond the twilight thing  there s a particular demographic of people who would even audition for the role of cedric diggory for goblet of fire. those were kids who read and loved stories with good narratives. the fact he knows  and apparently loves  ff7 should not be thatsurprising.
most of the fans were made with the original  the remake might for a number of the young audience  but they were already known. the remake mainly introduced graphics and some parts a modern visualization of scenes.
basically every final fantasy girl is beautiful
me too but tell her that old opinon on video games so 1987. gaming industy make money than us so I be careful if I were you .
@damonimpact01  no I wouldn t say that. I dont have to  educate  her  she just needs to shut it  chill and stop acting like a child.
I d ask her if she has ever played a computer game where the characters meant something special to her  if when she dismisses the concept  I d give her a condescending look and tell her she is not qualified to judge a game like ff7 and let s talk about something else  such as the less financially successful medium of movies.
yeah me too. when she said  ughhh a woman is a healer and we have to heal everyone . dude what  being a healer is op. so aerith is already a top tier female character. what s your problem with aerith ! she s the embodiment of a Goddess  beautiful yet strong. full of compassion and love for everyone. and zoe as a woman choses to bash her    whaaaaattt  and also to reduce tifa to only  a girl with short skirt . seriously  do not touch my girls  zoe.
@I have no orbs  exactly! aerith is the embodiment of purity and selflessness  and tifa is so kawaI when she s vulnerable. thats what feminists dont like at all  in the end  they love death.I played ff7 original  and a lot of others  has a young teenager when it came out on ps1  but I dont remember if aerith was only a healer back in the original. she s not in the ff7 remake  she s more than a healer  and at first  she s extremely weak  but by the end  she s actually almost the strongest one behind cloud  her attacks and utility in battle are incredibly useful.
@reg aubade  yeah I agree. aerith is a very beautiful character. so angelic. her selflessness is supposed to be a role model for everyone. also tifa s vulnerability is served as a reminder thatsomeone s strong could also feel vulnerable at times. and thats what make her human. its beautiful right  why do feminist hate these characters  I dont understand feminist. Imean  ofc you could not like a character  but please dont bash em in front of the fan  robert   I cant when people bashes on aerith n tifa. just....why  and also the infamous toxic  waifu war  within the fandom itself. gosh. meanwhile  aerith and tifa like each other. what broke me in tears when aerith died in og ff7 wasn t cloud reaction  but when tifa sat beside her and stroke her cheek the last time. and then ran away bursting into tears. they really like each other as a friend and could possibly become bff if she had live long. thankfully  somehow the dev hinted that we  maybe  could save aerith in ff7r  hopefully! .   would be fun to see how things developed between the girls in the second part. awwww  cant wait to plaaaaay!
@reg aubade   @reg aubade  but...if the feminist are females  why would they hate femininity    I dont get it. femininity isn t a weak trait. at all. sure its different from masculinity  but its not beneath masculinity at all. its like a right hand and a left hand. both are important but serve different purposes. I also like wearing jeans and sneakers but I dont bash women using skirts  high heels  bikinis.. hey even a burka would be fine too haha  does that mean my dad raised me well  but he never raise me and my brother differently  I played games  robots  dolls and even barbies with my brother  but I turned out like a normal girl  and my bro turned out like a normal boy. maybe its not totally the father s fault but the person themselves  yeeeeess! me too! I want an open world. and riding chocobooooos! I had so much fun riding chocobos in ffxv  I wish part 2 would be like ffxv you can go everywhere with a vehicle and chocobos. and I dont think part2 levels will be linked  or maybe they ll give an option whether you want to be linked or not. cause if youre already over leveled it wont be too fun to play part 2 with lvl70 cloud fighting lvl10 monsters  right
@I have no orbs  statistically Im right  personal anecdotes are anecdotes and exceptions proves the rule. your dad most likely loved you and gave his best according to what he knew. a person always have their own sins  but a lot of it comes from their upbringing. starting over without experience  powers  moves  items and everything else is weird  and certainly if we have to do it a 3rd time later this decade. we ll see.
@reg aubade  ahh is thatso  so there s even a statistic about that   I wonder why no media ever bring up about that. if something important like that is in the news or famous articles  wouldn t it be better for the world  so people can do parenting much better.awwww  youre right! my father loves us sooo much. he s like angeal  you know  hahaha so strong and looked angry all the time  but kindhearted.hm  is it that weird  I remembered Ive played a game with a system like that once  but I forgot the title. maybe they ll make it like a new game  yeah  the items etc will be there but idk about the levels. if itstays the way it was in part 1  maybe the enemy is scaled to match our levels  like in ff8.yeah  we ll see  anyway thank you  its been nice talking to youreg aubade haha I dont have that much friend to talk about games  sorry if I talked too much and spewed nonsense
yeah but aerith s better.
aerith is top tier waifu imo
I love them both but yeah they are top tier waifus and I couldn t give two shits about zoe kravitz.
@shaun jay  thats true  he could be mixing up tifa and yuffie a bit. but I am a man of true culture. and thus know tifa to be the best of girls.
when you come home from work and your girl is mixing you a drink  thats how you know you ve got a keeper.also  I dont drink.
I liked jessie the best. I didn t play the original game tho. I didn t like tifa much
yeah he described them horribly so I cant really blame her reaction. there s tons of  feminist  women who love this game and those characters.
the spunky playful one was the better girl for me. I didn t really care about tifa until late game.
we all had crushes on fictional characters while growing up.for example I had one on misty from pokemon.
exactly! a strong character ugh she s such a normie. like stay off things you dont understand zoe.
@magnime  and yet they expect us to become the  perfect man  from romantic movies.
to be fair  pattinson has gone on the record that he hated twilight and it was just a paycheck to him.
@richie gonzalez  fair point I only call him twilight boy now to illustrate a point of how I used to think of him he did the research and earned my respect lol
@richie gonzalez  looks like the same can be said of zoe and her catwoman.
yeah  I dont get how these people are shocked when they find out that people like other people who are nice.
its sad because she only got like a two-sentence description of these amazing characters but its like she didn t even care to know more beyond  short skirt . there is a lot of depth to both of these ladies that actually break archetypes and stand out  but she ll never know that.
the trend stands... when I do it  I am not doing it for attention.  omg  male attention is so evil!
Ive always argued that tifa and aerith are some of the best female characters in videogames  because they are in a sense the opposites of each other  and their personalities are in essence the opposite of their  visuals tifa is the softer more motherly girl next door character  but her  role  is that of the strong fighter fem fatale.aerith has the visuals of the  innocent school teacher  but is actually the more strong willed and  independent  woman.then there s yuffie... the kid sister.oh and the reason aerith and tifa are  the first love  characters for robert  and many of us who were young teens in the later 90 is exactly because they are well written humans  and not some one dimensional character without growth. both girls are lovable  but strong in their own way. but... I guess these days every female character has to be  insecure woman  who is actually awesome  she just needs to realize it  I d much rather see some actual human beings  and not some badly written fan fiction.ps  also why scuff at  oh we have to heal people!  when robert excitedly said  she s got superpowers  before he defined them as  she can heal people.  let thatsink in. having superpowers is apparently not good  unless they are aggressive powers that can kick ass
people like zoe is the reason we cant have nice things
I just found your channel completely by happenstance  or the youtube algorithm  however you want to look at it   and I really appreciate your genuine attitude. keep doing you  and dont let anyone change your mind or your words!
wow... I swear this is why us normal gamer girls are beloved.. cause we loved tifa and aerith too. we would just geek out with him.
aerith isnt just a healer she is the best offensive magic user you can have.
zoe complains about a short skirt  when she signed up to play a character that is known for wearing skin tight outfits............makes sense.
robert pattinson really humanized himself for me. him as a final fantasy fan just feels like a ray of sunshine for me. really seems like a bloke I could game with or go for beers with. I know and feel exactly where he comes from when he talked about it  I been there. he could have been a little more eloquent and descriptive  but when youre excited and love something  your love comes out as gibberish. thats me and final fantasy vi.
if anything  aerith and tifa are the embodiment of women power and as a woman who is super attracted to these characters  I dont see nothing wrong with them being a healer and sexy!
my favorite part is that you know who pattinson chose based on his descriptions of the 2 characters  bro combined tifa and yuffie and gave no context about either aerith  the really kind girl who has superpowers to heal everyone and make the world a better placetifa  like this sexy little thing like a thief she wears a short skirt
classic ff7 has been my absolute favorite game since I was a kid  and I absolutely love the remake of itso far. melonie you should pull up the characters in ff7 remake just so you can paint a better picture for everybody.  I am a lot like robert when I get to talk about the ff7 game I get all giddy about it  and sometimes its hard to put into words the relationship you have with that game to someone like zoe.
melonie is like a cross between aerith and tifa. she has the kindness and spirituality of the former  and the fortitude  yet occasional vulnerability   vitality  and pretty  very feminine features of the latter. pattinson comes across as a decent  humble bloke.
I will say  as much as I love seeing robert so excited about it  I can see why someone outside might wonder wtf he s on about if they didn t know the game.  healer or short skirt  are his favourite characters seriously  though  aerith heals people... but she also threatens to cut their balls off  just ask don corneo . meanwhile  tifa isn t healing shit  she s punching faces and saving the planet  no matter what she s wearing.I also wanted to say when I was young playing the original ffviI  I was 100  team tifa. the remake made me 100  aerith  I just fell in love with how she was written and performed.finally  I find it funny that when I was younger  I d want lightning powers or flight or some stupid shit. now  I d choose healing as my power every time.
first time watching one of your videos. I dont know you. youtube just popped up your video and I read the title.so  4 minutes in watching and you just said it all.its so good seeing a young modern girl like you understanding the bs some people are trying to mind wash us with.thank you.
tifa and aerith have been loved and adored for 25 years  and will continue to be loved and adored long after zoe kravitz has shriveled up and died.
mm   my arms are probably my favorite feature. mm s eyes   am I a joke to you
1. yea we all have a crush on tifa and aerith but we all have a crush on melonie too. 2. its such a stark difference in the way they were describing the characters. he was talking about them as characters  their roles  who they are  their importance to the story  etc. and she was strictly thinking about their looks and gave zero craps about the rest. she couldn t care less about how important they were because they were what she envisioned as stereotypes. so stupid.
I remember seeing that male fantasy thing. and in my mind I was like  there are also women who have the same tastes. also why is appealing to a demographic s fantasy a bad thing  they can have their own. if they dont like the  male fantasy games  then there s plenty to find even for the non-gamers.
pattinson talking about ffviI is not what I expected to see today but Im happy I did
I was just waiting for zoe to say the classic and reliable  unrealiatic beauty standards  in response to tifa and aerith. would be funny coming from a walking unrealistic beauty standard.
Imean aerith isn t just a healer. she also does the most powerful offensive magic attacks too. she is top tier on both ends of the mage spectrum. zoe has no idea about any of this though but it really shows the mindset she is coming from.
mm   what is it about this character that is so threatening to zoe kravitz  the fact that even though tifa is imaginary she has more depth of character and is more relatable than a wokie npc
zoe  poor women always have to be healerstifa  let me suplex this giant snake.
two fictional women were such a threat to zoe thatshe had to lash out be catty. tifa lockhart is a well-defined we ll written strong  strong woman who is emotionally and physically strong.
I take this personally lol. Im actually replaying the game now and not to far from the one part that makes us all sad.
zoe  poor women  we have to heal everyone.me  clearly  she s never seen redo of healer.
men that heal   combat medic
zoe is that chick every nerd detested when we were kids. its clear robert loves the game  and struggles to explain it well  but the way she reacts...
its nice to see robert get geeky and kinda cute about finial fantasy. zoe just doesnt understand the power of a good healer  or the power of a fist to the jaw.
what melonie said about how women react to  guys showing excitement or giddiness about something  is  I think why I enjoy her content. she seems to enjoy a lot of the same things I do and  the best part  is annoyed by the same things.
Christ! if zoe is mad about tifa  then for God s sake  nobody tell her about katt in breath of fire 2.she doesnt even wear pants!  haha!
zoe isn t someone who understands humans. the fact is even women have their fair share of characters who are sexualized that they love. the man sitting next to her is a real good example of a guy who was in a movie that was made to satisfy women their fantasies. its the reason why him and that jacob guy were shirtless for almost 80  of the movies.
in this interview  you can see a glimmer of a real  honest-to-God  actual person coming out of robert pattinson. unfortunately  all the arrogance  narcissism  and self-righteous soapboxing make it easy to forget that  some of  these people probably were  normal  once. that they might have an actual personality buried under all the nonsense and insanity. it makes me kind of sad to wonder what they might have been like without the corrupting influence of fame and bad politics.
zoe is what s wrong with the world and if alot of girls look up to that then definitely we have to educate men to stay away from relationships.both tifa and aerith are strong female characters in mentality if you actually play the game aerith is ready and able to defend herself when needed and tifa can beat the shit out of everything yet have a vulnerable side.woke women like zoe are never happy.
he should have explained the slap fight scene. that was such a hype moment. zoe will never be as awesome as either of them.
I love that you always have a quote from the Bible thats relevant to the topics you talk about. even if I dont necessarily consider myself Christian  although I do still believe in God   its great to see how the truth and value within these scriptures that have been around for many millennia still hold up.
let s add a detail. tifa wearing short skirts is actually very pragmatic. it will be easier for her to move and perform her kicks and acrobatics with that attire.
funny thing is if zoe just listen she would know that aerith and tifa isn t the typical portrayal of women. aerith is a badass magician while tifa is straight up gangsta.
now that the world knows that robert pattinson loves ff7  let s hope he gets a vocal role in the next ff7remakes
Im more surprised more people haven t said this in the comments. she s just an all-around powerful magic caster in general. healing and damage.
@zyler
broke my heart as a kid thankfully the remake doesnt impress me so wont have to watch it in 4k
zoe gonna learn real quick that people like fictional characters more than her because they have just that  character  and she doesnt
I think the guy in the vid did a really bad job of explaining these characters though because aerith isn t  the healer  she is a person of an ancient bloodline that connects her directly to the lifeforce of every living thing on the planet and even the planet itself.  because of this she can call on the planet to heal and protect.  she is also there by choice  she starts the game off selling flowers for 2 gil each but then volunteers to join the team and in the end makes the choice to leave and self-sacrifice.  tifa isn t just the one with the short skirt  she is someone that has dedicated her life to martial arts and uses these skills  as part of a group called avalanche  to protect and defend people in villages and towns from a powerful corporation and when cloud is sick she saves his life.  furthermore she is the first person to directly challenge sephiroth in combat  when she is just a teenager no less  after sephiroth kills her father and slaughters the people of her hometown. and just a slight addition to both of these character s story arch is the very minor plotpoint that they are both romance options.because the guy in the vid only mentioned the romance options and one very irrelevant trait about both characters he makes them seem like really generic romance characters. because we know about the characters we can see past that but to the girl he is talking to she only knows what he is telling her and so they just sound like the boring old stereotypes that have short skirts and dig out the splinters as well as be romanced by the main character.he had the chance to makethese characters sound as awesome as we know they are but he kind of blew it  so I can see where her reaction is coming from.
first off as soon as you mentioned scripture and youre thoughts on the woke I instantly subbed. now hold on  just found this channel and I thank God! Christian  gamer  tatted  gym but  and gorgeous ! omg I know youre probably taken but man youre literally what I pray for in a wife  God is good I know we ll eventually get married...Imean eventually I ll get married to someone like you
she grows out her armpit hair  thats all you need to know about zoe!
I wasn t expecting such a positive message from a video on this topic
in the original  I fell for aerith and was crushed when  you know...  but in the remake  Im a tifa supersimp.  still love aerith  especially her va  but tifa is just incredible in every way in remake.
melonie  I like showing off my arms.melonie s midriff  what am I  carbohydrates !
I guarantee she didn t have a problem with the love triangle between edward bella and jacob who was always shirtless whenever he had the time
have zoe watch redo of healer and maybe see will see the other side of the spectrum. also shaman kings faust wasn t as much as a healer but his regenerative capabilities were spot on and insane.
zoe was just busting his chops and trying to be funny  and I found that whole conversation fucking hilarious because of it.
what zoe really says  im jealous
zoe kravitz herself have issues. I cantell she is a nightmare to be around. not only thatshe is mad thatshe has no clue what the hell they are talking about and the attention isn t centered around her. God forbid guys having fun and sharing a common experience with one another in front of a woman. exactly what you just said melonie some women are vibe killers  when I use to express excitement about something around my ex she did the exact same thing to me all the time. I had to drop her  she ain t worth it. zoe said in an older interview related to the batman  thatshe dont want men sexualizing her when watching the movie. like wtf
why do you let words offend you so much  based af
maybe she should read tales of two pasts. ff7 remake is my first final fantasy game and I was hooked! I especially loved tifa in the game since she felt like the most human among the cast of characters. she felt complex and flawed. she s torn between wanting to do her part in saving the planet and not wanting to compromise her morals by doing so. this conflicting nature was well written in the game and even after the sector 7 bombing  she does let her grief and anger consume her. she still had her doubts and she remains kinda and humble. but that doesnt mean she wont kick ass if necessary. in a way  she represents the games conscious  which is relieving in a game with mostly grey characters. I felt compelled to read totp and it made me love tifa way more than I did before. yes  she s attractive  but her character makes her even more beautiful. I highly recommend reading it even if youre not into final fantasy. not thats she cares or anything.
zoe is just big mad that tifa and aerith have a bigger fan base as fake characters than she will ever have in real life.
never would have thought robert pattinson was an ff7 fan.  more respect for this man for being real and relatable.  no respect for zoe for judging other women.  what s wrong with women that are loving  nurturing  healers   aren t there a lot of women nurses and doctors out there   apparently  zoe thinks this is the problem with the world....
there s that one video thatsaid about tifa and aerith personality is actually opposite of what we actually perceives from their outward appearances. aerith is actually the tomboy and feisty ones instead of tifa.
thanks for your awesome take on this. you earned a subscriber xd
in her defense robert over simplifies his love for both women. tifa is more than a hot girl in a skirt. she s his childhood friend whom he loves deeply lol
I work on films in hollywood  but live elsewhere. as soon as you cross into la county you can feel the cringe creeping over your face. thatsnotty vibe that emitted from zoe slithers all through hollywood. I hear  women shouldn t do sexy halloween costumes   and  in ten years breasts wont be a sexual thing anymore   etc. all day. its the gas in their bubble.
lool  the models for the remake are gorgeous.. and its hilarious aerith in the front world is  average looking loll
healing is part of the trinity you dont get far with out one. so not only is robert a nerd king so is henry two of the best actors right now.
aerith isn t a healer though  if her job was anything  its sage. she s a black mage and white mage mashed together  but without being able to be a decent melee combatant  barring a short period if you steal the weapon from the chariot boss  that would make her a red mage.
I just clicked this video because of the 3  tifa  aeris  and zoe. little did I know that you are proudly based as well. I love it. keep doin your thang 100 !!
keep up the excellent work  melonie.
she seems pretty happy to play a character with a history of attempting to groom and seduce a 15 year old boy by way of her many attempts at having nightwing.
tifa s personality is what makes her even hotter.
3 12 when the guy realises that his honest and friendly words are going to be used as woke ammo against him.
short skirt ....my brain  and a long jacket.I know tifa doesnt have one but Ive been hearing the cake song quite a bit lately.
daily reminder that  aeris     aerith. a common misconception is that japanese doesnt have a  -th  suffix. this is false. the issue was that there is no way to differentiate between the  -su  and  -th  suffixes. earisu translates to both aeris and aerith. which do you choose  the man who did the overwhelming majority of the english translation intentionally changed it to aeris after discussing it with the square dev team. everyone agreed that aeris sounded better.  aerith  sounds like someone speaking with a lisp in english.the confusion comes in because the original dev patch just changed the name selection screen  default name  from aerith to aeris. but the dialog database kept the original default name  aerith  which would be overwritten by the name selection screen. a host of fan-made translators misunderstood this to be a mistake. it wasn t a mistake. it was the english translation team and a group of original developers who changed  aerith  to  aeris  because itsounded better -- and it was based off a perfectly valid suffix in japanese.   -su  instead of  th  .dont believe me  you can see the glitch in old videos of the game. an infamous one skips from sector 7 to wall market  whereby aeris is automatically added to your party.  since you skip meeting her and going to her house  you skip the name selection screen. which means that you skip the name selection screen patch. and so her name defaults to aerith. this is a misunderstanding of the original game development and translation work. it doesnt make sense if youre unaware of the name selection patch.and of course  if you played final fantasy tactics back then   flower girl  was named  aeris   depending on which version of the game you played. the name wasn t changed officially to aerith until kingdom hearts several years after ff7  and fft  were released. and nomura just changed it back to aerith out of pettiness. an act of ownership to negate the original english translation.tldr  aeris sounds better than aerith. and aeris was always both a valid translation  and the original english translation team s decision. nomura  game designer and director  only changed it years later because he s a petty douche.in conclusion  aeris   aerith.
5 42 that is the literal definition of a hypocrite...
tifa literally beats the shit out of enemies with her bare hands... gimme a break.
I knew zoe was a little weird when she said  you aren t allowed to sexualise her as cat woman
double standards like this always infuriate me. I bet you anything she s enganged in some blatantly trashy romance media before  either some dumb novel or a movie or whatever. and there s nothing wrong with that  but the minute something similiar is made for men she thinks its wrong. seems like sadly many people think like this.
if you play d d  you know how valuable and fun healers are.
I think its more of a  immortal beauty thing . where they know they are going to get older but cartoon are forever and it makes them jealous. thats what  I get out of it anyways.
when I started to follow you it was because you were into videogames which is something that I am really into. I was surprised to hear that you go to church and doing Bible verses on your channel. I used to go to church but itseemed like my age group didn t go to church. I would find people too old to kids or anybody close to my age were married. I ended up leaving the church for that and for other reasons. I think its cool that you still go and happy for you. kind of wish I could do the same...
I dont care if zoe kravitz was a 10 10 in the looks department  never paid enough attention to really have thoughts on that   with that personality it doesnt matter. she couldn t even let a guy talk about his innocent silly boyhood crush on fictional characters without having to turn it political and societal. robert was being genuine and vulnerable with a bit of cheeky fun about something he enjoyed and from go you cantell she just wants to trample all over it. what a cruddy way to be.
to all non native english speakers  snub   to insult someone by not giving them any attention or treating them as if they are not important.
fun fact  back when female gamers started to get into the mmorpg games almost 2 decades ago  the healer support class was most of the time their main pick. I know that for a fact because  at least every 7 out of 10 women that Ive met in mmorpg games since back in 2006 were main healer support class. even nowadays  some females still have a tendency to main healer support class when the option is available  which is not a bad thing. in some games the support role is way more important than the dps. tldr  zoe is not a gamer  of course  thats why she doesnt understand the mayor importance of healers in rpg games.
to be fair to zoe  robert did a shit job of explaining just who these two characters are or the allure of them to fans of the game. aerith  an ancient  a priestess of the earth by all accounts  practices magic and the mystic arts of healing. it fits with her kind  giving nature and she serves as the groups moral compass and anchor. she prays for the salvation of the planet and all living things on it  knowing full well she will die for attempting to do so. girls literally the closet thing to a messianic figure in the entire ff franchise. tifa on the other hand is strong  and daring and quite possible the strongest martial artist on the entire planet of ffvii. a warrior monk who lets her fists do the talking and is one of the hardest hitting party members in the game. she s not just a  sexy girl in a skirt ...Christ patterson you are killing me right now!
tumbleweeds...
@shaun jay  ban everyone who watches dubbed anime.
@joshua h  just saying but the dub of bebop is arguably really good.but yeah subs   dubs.
cope.
regardless  her canon name is aerith in english now and ever since  corrected   regardless of japanese pronunciation and grammar back in the game. it is like how some names are different between different countries and even if people can pronounce things differently  you correct yourself if the one named tells you to. kuraudo sutoraifu is the real name of cloud.
@joshua h  that is interesting  I knew about everything you said  except for the part that was agreement between the devs and the translator  do you have any link that mentions that by any chance  this game had a very interesting development.
@pimentx  oh  man. I ll try to dig it up. this isn t new information to me or anything. heck  this isn t even an original comment  just one I copy and paste every now and again because the pro  aerith  people annoy me.
daily reminder that  aeris     aerith.a common misconception is that japanese doesnt have a  -th  suffix. this is false. the issue was that there is no way to differentiate between the  -su  and  -th  suffixes. earisu translates to both aeris and aerith. which do you choose  the man who did the overwhelming majority of the english translation intentionally changed it to aeris after discussing it with the square dev team. everyone agreed that aeris sounded better.  aerith  sounds like someone speaking with a lisp in english. and so on  that is not a daily reminder and basically none of what you said is true. I will keep this short because this is an argument thats beeng going on for over 2 decades and judging by what you wrote nothing you want to write will bring anything new to the table. this is an attempt of mine to explain it once and I will surely not let this turn into another degenerate argument like the many on youtube. so either you accept it after the first time or you do not.1.  aeris   aerith  is a factual statement of yours which is of no actual factual value. it is purely subjctive. I will not argue which sound you like more. I think aeris is also  nicer  but that is not the point.2. no  it is not a misconception. by default japanese does not have an english  th.  just like german does not have an english th. you know why  because they are different languages. it is true though that in japanese you do have your syllables which you can use to  mimic  the sounds of a set of characters whose established pronunciation does not come from the language in question and that japan has syllables which can mimic the english  th   particularly the syllable  su  which itshares with  s . japan also does not have the german  ch -sound just like americans and british people do not have it. nonetheless in japan they have the tools to approximate the sound. just like they  reconstruct  the sond of an  x.  they just do not have them because they are completely different languages and japanese does not primarily make use of the alphabet which we have. it is not absent from japan and they use it whenever they write a word in roumajI  which they also just use to express the writing of their own syllables  or for advertisement of other things  such are the cases where they might use western characters which do not exist in their language  but generally they have their own language and stick to their rules. if a german person or a japanese person uses a proper english th it is because that person was specifically trained to adapt. it will not magically become a part of the language itself. language can  take  an entire word from another language  that is possible but even in those cases english and japanese are so different and their tongues are used to differently that they still have to use the rules of their language. german and english are both germanic languages so they have even more in common but nonetheless it does not change which sounds german does not have. english is no english different. english has no         - no matter how much they try to replicate the sounds. which most english speaking people not even do even though their language and relation to german and would easily allow it  especially as     has a sound which very often is used for english words that either contain an  a  or  e  which is the reason why      and   are alternatively written as ae  oe and ue. which  while not intented by me  is more than fitting right now because the ae and aerith is very close to the german  . anyway  no japan does not  have  a  th  but yes  they are aware of it and can replicate it. 3. the confusion comes from nothing about the name selection screen. the whole dialog database thing was not even publicly used as an argument by people until a few years ago. aerith was always since the late 90s revealed to be aerith because several media showed it. her name in the japanese instruction manual flat out uses  aerith   the kaitaI shinsho mentions her name is aerith and where the name originates from  the windows version from 1998 has a wallpaper files which is named aerith  etc. pp. 4.  perfectly valid  means does not mean  fulfilling the intention . I can ask you if you cantell me what time it is. you can choose to be a douche  say  yes  I can  and go away. perfectly legitimate  right  you answered according to my question which can be deciphered as  do you have the capability of telling me what time it is.  still it was an error because it was an answer not actually properly responding to the intent of the sender. the katakana for  e-a-ri-su  can be written as earisu  earis  airith  airis  with an english  aI  in mind and not a japanese one   aeris  aerith   rith  ealisu  ealis  blablabla. all legitimate. but not all correct. aeris was just easy because it is an actually existing word. but you could also legitimate transliterate  kuraudo  to  crowd  and it would still not be correct. the english words  reverse  and  rebirth  use the same katakana but they are two different words with different meanings and just following a  legitimate  transliteration is meaningless. you know why  zack  is zack s name  because the translator has to say jackshit about what the actual name is. zack is written as  zakkusu  but the creators intended for  zakkusu  to stand for  zack  in case of that particular guy. just as  tiida  is decided to stand for  tidus . if the translator s word would mean as much as that of the creator and legitimacy    truthfulness then zack would need to be translated as something like  zaks  which is wrong. his name is zack. and aerith has is a lot easier thana zack and tidus because in her case her western writing can even be properly transliterated by just following the rules. you know why the english version of sephiroth with an english th is the obviously correct one  you guessed it. because of the syllable that you mentioned.  su . sephiroth is a hebrew word and pronouncing it with a hard  t  is normally the correct one but he is a fictional character where the makers make the rules. they decided to write him with a  su  instead of a  to  and signalized that it is supposed to stand for a  th  instead of an  s  because they published it in several media. which is also where you nomura tetsuya-scapegoating attempt fails because nomura-san never did anything. nomura tetsuya is out of all people the one who writes  sefiros  instead of  sephiroth  in his own artwork so you can bet your ass earisu being publicised as aerith in more than one occasion goes far beyond just nomura-san. especailly in final fantasy viI square showed they are willing to change their names if they need to. barret s name was supposed to be  barett  and evidently seen in the japanesse instruction manual from 1997  yet they changed itso there is no unwillingness to do anything if it makes sense.aerith is an allusion to  earth  and not supposed to be the latin word for  air . that is just how it is. it might blow you mind but american fans do not decide what is true about the product they do not own. do you think  caitsith  is pronounced  kate  star wars term    no  it is not. and not just because the caitsith is an existing word but because square decided what the character us supposed to be pronounced as. like cat shee. as in banshee. also your entire lisp argument makes zero sense because aerith is pronounced like tons of other words in the english language with a  th .
5. it was not changed from kh1 on. it was never changed to begin with. iknew aerith is aerith long before kh1 came out. stop trying to blame the creators for something you do not want to accept. they do not give a shit about tina being terra even though she is marketed as in japan just as earisu is marketed as aerith in japan they do not give a shit about bartz being bartz even though he is marketed as butz in japan. they did not even bother correcting people on the fact that ke-fu-ka is supposed to be written cefca which is a thing english speaking people go on ranting about because  wahwah   ce  has no  ke  sound which is something j.r.r. tolkien would laugh about who also made his own characters which  ce  and a  ke  sound . aerith is aerith because she always was. they did not even bother insisting on final fantasy xv s cidney being called cindy even though it completely takes away the meaning behind her name so dont act like they would care so much that just for their ego they have to force a name upon people. the name always existed  it was always meant to be and not just retroactively. 6. stop blaming nomura tetsuya for everything. I know it has become sort of a trend to blame the director of something because people do not get that director s are not the sole creators of characters and stories in most cases especially as in ffviI it was a collaborative effort and ffviI s original version did not even have him as director - that was kitase-san - but as a character designer who contributed to the story with him until nojima-san truly wrote the actual story but this scapegoating just for the sake of justifying the excuses of a fan to not accept something he dislikes has to stop.7. what is canonical has 0 to do with  an agreement  between creator and fans. this is just another made up rule just like all of those fan rules everyone comes up with everyday to invalidate something of a franchise they like that happens to be one sole factor they dislike. you and I do not own the rights  you and I do not own anything. we decide nothing. your lack of interest in this is already shown because you apparently like 95  of people use the noun  canon  while not even being aware of the words  canonicity  or even better and that is what people in most cases should use  the adjective  canonical.  I guess I have to give you credit for not writing  cannon  like others do but considering the competition thats not saying much. anyway  consumers decide jackshit. own the brand  own the rights. it would not even make sense for fans to have thatsay because it would lead to a paradoxical situation. to think the owner has to  agree  with anything a consumer says or thinks or that the consensus of the most vocal immature fans is what matters is megalomania from fans and not how the world works. I also do not want to die one day but I have to obey those rules. fiction that does not belong to you is no different. I know when it comes to fiction people like to use stuff like  death of the author  as last resort-argument as well but it also just boils down to trying to escape a fact they do not like about something they do not like and having the borderline-insane thoughts they have power over something that is not theirs.8. there never has been such an interview and even if for some reason this would be a rare  hardly by anyone known accessed interview the translator still has no control over what is correct. there is always a team thatsays  okay  let s publish it and sell it   that does not mean everything thatstands in a book  is mentioned in a movie or a game is correctly deciphered. I am german. the german translation of ffviI is notorious for being full of errors. you will not see me argue that it is  as true  just because they published that disgrace. and never in a million years you will see me argue that a legitimate translation and transliteration or for what it is worth a legitimate response in regards to the rules of communication in general holds the same validity  value and weight the one which reflects the original intention.so  like aeris all you want. it is a pretty name. but it is not hers. it is almost comedic that you talk about the nuisances that are  aerith defenders  when all you do is regurgitate arguments from the last 25 years from the other fraction which does not only do a sloppy job in that regard but follows the same made up rules as with every other franchise when they are not satisfied with something. there is no meaning and originality behind that and if youreally are  so annoyed  and need to bring up your  daily reminder  then there is a high probability that you will ignore all meaning of what I just said and try to use more of the same arguments but I can reassure you you are wastinf your time because you are not the first and you will not be the last one and you will not get another response from me because if you think you know what being annoyed is then argue about ffviI for 25 years. aerith is not the only element from the game people try to make up their own rules about and disrespect the makers. and as matter of fact people are the same in all franchises. star wars and dragon ball is as bad  if not even worse.anyway  thats my 50 cents. take it or leave it. I will not waste my time with this youtube comment section anymore.
believe she s what u call a hypocrite
@npc Im knot  like so many.. worship me and pay me lots of money but dont sexualised
high five from yuffie.also  I would disagree with some points. I do not think aerith  practices  magic in the term of going out and destroying a practice dummy every day  nor casting healing wind on townspeople but if you mean she has magic powers then yes. I also never bought into thatshe sacrifice herself. that goes against the very message kitase even commented on about specifically her death not being hollywood-like   ff viI remake goes so hollywood on deaths it is painful though . she also says she will be back  but she is killed before being able to come back  and I do not think it was a lie to comfort cloud but rather her intention. if anything the voices she heard were guiding her  but it is not said thatshe know she will die at any point  even if there is a lot of foreshadowing. ff viI remakes theme of fate does throw a planet sized wrench into the cogs of the ogs themes though and people will extrapolate the remakes story unto the og even if it is a sequel  an actual remake or just classified as a random term that contradicts itself.
I totally agree with you here  I think if he explained better then she wouldn t have said those things.
no he didn t. aerith heals a tifa has a short ass skirt
like you said. zoe is playing the same character as tifa. only I d argue tifa has way more substance than catwoman. zoes whole brand is she s sex on legs. and she s bashing tifa for wearing a short skirt.
shoot  I could ve used that verse all this month before I possibly destroyed a friendship out of self doubt and envy. but at least now I know when would be a good time to get back in touch and hope that friend will accept me back  and that is when I feel better about myself. when I am stronger and feel more secure about myself  that will be the best time for me to try to mend things with the friend. I have noticed that I feel better about myself ever since not speaking to them  because they dont want to speak to me or are to busy  personally hope its the second one . not because they did anything wrong  but my mind tends to start thinking about how they are so much more successful in everything  and I am not. but it has given me the drive and want to change and find ways to grow. just now its more of just a manifestation stage where I currently dont have what I need  but I am working and waiting to get what is needed. I do hope my friendship with the person will be alright and back to the way it used to be  it was such a great friendship  one of the only things in my life I was ever truly thankful for. so to think that Imight have ruined it because I couldn t control my envy
the first time I saw her was literally playing a striper mutant in x-men first class. her whole carrier has literally been about how sexy she is. yet she complains about video game characters being sexy.
I think this is the best example of all time showing why its literally impossible to please a feminist. well  we have this one girl whose conservatively dressed  is a tomboy  and she s this healer ....oh  why does the woman always gotta be the healer! well  there is this other girl whose a martial arts master  she s sweet and wears this minI skirt ...oh  so she has a miniskirt!  this is what Imean!!!!!!!
robert pattinson is a ff7 fan   hell yeah!  I officially really like this guy now.  also tifa is.....breast girl.  I regret nothing.
I have never played ff7 its not my type of game  but I can respect the joy in robert p eyes. I remember some great games.
your eyeliner is on point just always impressed with how well thats applied. like I watch my wife put that on and think it just seems so precise
0 12  Im everywhere. I d love to see you there. well youre not in my dms so I wouldn t say youre everywhere
giving zoe the benefit of doubt  she doesnt seem like the type who is interested in those types of games anyway. rob patterson was enthusiastic in his explanation  but didn t sell it well to his co-star. he could have described tifa as a  sexy fighter badass   which may have appealed to her more. I am sure other things are at play like maybe a certain image she chooses to uphold  based on her reaction words .either way we know that rob patterson is on team aerith aeris... lol
yes  why not comment on a video game you ve never heard off from a franchise thats famous for its storytelling. it isn t about the choice between all possible women. it is a choice between two specific characters. they make you fall in love with both for a very specific reason  being that they ll take one away for good making the choice for you. it is a gripping moment.
does zoe realize she s talking to the guy who played edward  I remember back in the day  girls in my school would talk about who would they choose   the cute one or the jacked one  from twilight. why  dont men get to have their fun
mel should cosplay tifa I d love to see that
who didn t have a crush on tifa honestly
to be fair he didn t explain the awesomeness of tifa fairly
team aerith!!!!!
I wonder if rob knows we will try saving aerith this time around. as a girl  I always loved aerith. ..cause she was genuinely kind.  she didn t  use her sex appeal to be a strong whaman. aerith was a strong woman.
free the arms I can dig it and I always love the verse of the day
breaking   zoe kravitz scores massive own-goal.
to be fair  itseems robert was setting her up to respond this way with his cheeky interpretation  but the sentiment is still there.
my mom loved aerith she was always like no choose aerith
tifa is a flippin boxer in that game and zoe is calling sexism lol.
thanks for mentioning the rebel ice cream.   tried a pint of vanilla and it was tasty!
I doubt zoe kravitz has ever played final fantasy in her life.
I have to say  if the best way you can characterize tifa and aerith are  girl in short skirt  and  healer ..... thats a problem right there.
wow  realized that melonie and tifa look a lot alike.
having the ability to heal people is what s wrong with this world.
she is threaten cuz tifa can kick her butt final fantasy viI is one my favorite games to date. I dont see how these games demoralize women I see them as badasses!!! woke....wokie....whatever they call themselves  I call myself a boomer!!! keep being you melonie  dont ever change!!
yikes! now Im nervous about that batman movie
if I never saw an interview or read a quote from an actor or actress again my life would be no different one way or the other. I can do without these people s opinion about anything and everything
so apparently according to her having a crush on a woman who is a doctor is a problem in real world.
great video. its nice to hear a woman s perspective on this.
my wife and I have been watching the early 2000 jennifer garner.  series alias. her character was smart  bad ass  and insanely sexy. often her alias would involve over the top sexy outfits. a feminazI would call her appearance  exploitation   but in reality it is actually the ultimate camouflage. hot ladies to us guys scrambles the brain  denying us the ability to question the why and how of anything. it is why the guards let her go  and she is able to go anywhere without being questioned. yes ladies  hotness is a super power unlike any other. fyI  my wife doesnt seem to get offended when jennifer is kicking someone in the face wearing a evening gown. she loves all her outfits. peace.
I love he talk about final fantasy!
I was watching for a little while but this video made me like and sub. I need to make more videos and watching your videos has me wanting to get back at it. thank you
she makes it even easier to not see this movie
aerith is the innocent girl and tifa is the baddass from the rough side of town.
what I find funny is she has a negative opinion of the love triangle in ff7 and says this to an actor who is famous for being in a movie about a love triangle. I guess its only a problem for her when its 2 females instead of 2 males though.
aww he so cute when talking about ffvii. I love ffviI so much and im happy that he likes it. zoe. you didn t even play the game. so shush  btw  aeris is my daughter
tifa and aerith are awesome
sephiroth   this is why I impale people
got it backwards
dam. imagine liking something and somebody sitting next to you is condescendingly criticizing every detail of it.now imagine being in a relationship with this person.
you would make a great live action tifa lockhart.
while I do like his energy for ffviI he did get information wrong about tifa lol. she wasn t a theif she was a monk by the roles that ff has. I did find it a bit annoy that he didn t go into detail about tifa s personally like he did with aerith. tbh he may not have played the game in a long time and may have forgotten. it also kinda tells me that he s more of a fan of aerith than tifa which is cool lol. her though...Imean her dad is lenny kravitz! she s more than likely in the movie because of her name alone. just for her name. you also pointed out about her hypocrisy. she complains about a sexy female character because of her apperence and not even fully hear him out on the game which may have gotten him nervous and misspoke on tifa the way he did. I absolutely love tifa more than aerith mainly because aerith came off as pushy in the original game. tifa is shy and caring. she s empathetic and tries to  see good in people. pretty much shown in the game because can be an asshole but  she knows somwthing is wrong with him especially once you find out what happened to him and he it effected him. aerith a great character herself where she can be just as kind and caring like robert said but  in the original game like I said before on why I didn t like her is she can be very pushy and a bit childish at times. in crisis core she was more likeable and you learn why she is wearing the ribbon in her hair. you learn when she got the idea for the  one date  came from. even in the remake she gave off the vibe she had in crisis core which was nice to see. zoe just need a reality check. Imean no disrespect but  she s pulling the holier than thou crap which is turn off really. she s playing a character who using her sexuality to lower her enemies guards down to get what she wants. that doesnt really make her look good.
thirteen years here  too. we re just a heartbeat away from overnight success. I can feel it!
wow youre right and she s playing  catwoman being sexy. and  aerith has on a dress and is covered up. very good video  melonie
I have zero expectations for the batman movie and might see it in theater this year.
this more than anything cements the tomboy aesthetic for you mel  you miss the point of what she s doing here.she has zero idea of what either the interviewer or pattinson is talking about  the moment you can see it is where he s talking about aeris and tifa right off  her head is down  her face is neutral and her eyes and unfocused. its a glazed over expression women can give when they re not interested and bored with a conversation in order to get the guy to shut upbut pattinson doesnt  he kinda shocked me at how much of a geek he s being here really gushing about it and going on oblivious to the signals the woman is giving off. so what does she do when ignored by the man  she gets petty as she feels like she s being ignored and slighted  tries to make him feel less for liking stuff. and pattinson in stellar autistic fashion just steemrolls over it and keeps talking  not giving a single crap.
keep up the good work
Imean yes  her input is obnoxious and demonstrative of why manga anime is absolutely crushing comic books right nowhowever  I do love how he s completely unfazed  like he s completely dismissing what she s sayingas much as it gets demonized and memed  taking the  ahh  you just dont get it  approach is actually the high road in some cases
a love triangle where one is supposed to be the cute one and the other is the hot one... reminds me of this book movie for chicks  I think it was called twilight  I wonder if they ve ever heard of it...
robert   I love final fantasy 7me   bullshitrobert   mentions aerith s real name aeris me   he is the chosen one
first off  I dont know why zoe has an issue with women being healers in games. Imostly play white mage in final fantasy xiv because I get the power trip of having the ability to let you know that you only live because I permit it. healers in games are unironically some of the most important roles. nevermind that aerith doesnt just have to heal. the customization the game allows can allow aerith to viably use the age old  ooga booga  hit it until it dies  strategy  or she could go full on black magic plus mega damage from the summons.onto the real subject though  I dont entirely blame zoe for her reaction because I dont see any other way for someone who isn t attached to ff7 to take it. the way robert explained it  it definitely makes itsound like the choice is either  healer  or  ho  and thats all they are when in reality both characters have their depth and purpose. thatsaid  I will blame zoe for the unprofessionality of what she says. the bit about  women have to heal  and  this is what s wrong with the world  is just... robert is talking about something that meant a lot to him growing up and I dont think she d appreciate him saying something rude about something she loved growing up.
appeals to male fantasy  next to cloud and berrot. lol
she sounds like she s jealous that these fictional characters have more personality than she does
it was hard to tell if she was trying to be funny and sarcastic or if she was serious
hey melonie  next time you do a comments video tell us about your tats. like if they mean something and or what they mean etc. that always intrigues me.
if your intimidated by a fictional character just trust me on this one...you got no sexual marketplace value to worry about loosing.
I cant believe I respect the twilight guy now
as bubbles would say  I like liquor and who  rez -  since tifa owns a bar  thats my girl.
ohhh do you know why - in final fantasy  people thought aerith was average lol.  aerith was also very down to earth and got cloud to open up. clearly  rob is attracted to that personality. just saying.
I hope he had his steadfast block materia equipped
I think I said it before but I ll say it again!! I love your thinking!! every video you ve made Ive agreed with! finally someone who is real and down to earth!! Im neutral on most things and even though I love tomb raider  final fantasy is my holy grail and I didn t have a clue what the title of this meant until I watched it. but Im glad youre not knocking final fantasy
everyone  how high is kravitz
I know a healer named kaeru I could introduce her to....she might not like it  though.also  as far as jealousy goes  tifa may be a digital character  but from the sound of itshe s prettier on the inside than zoe kravitz.
the left  healthcare is a right.the left  omg  youre a healer  pshhh.
in games healers are vital. I play healers all the time. my main wow healer is a human male druid. cough cough i...uh...will admit...uh...that....uh... the tomb raider effect did cause me to make my first druid as a ne female.
a cookbook! melonie mac and cheese!  makes your taste buds go boom  keto options of course
she isn t going to miss an opportunity to shoot a man down and crush something he loves. misandry in action.
imagine having the hypocrisy as a person getting paid to wear a tight cat suit and think thats alright for women at the same time thinking women who heal or wear short shorts is what s wrong with the world.
God  she is the type of person who has got to shit on everything if someone likes it and she doesnt  God these type of people are infuriating
man enjoys something that makes him smilewoman most affected
quoting scripture made me subscribe
Imean  she s not given much context so I wouldn t hold it against her. but you cantell he s really excited  and she s just being dismissed and mean. pooping on his parade.he seems like a genuinely nice guy though.
tifa and aerith are great.
she hates them because they have  plot  and she s lacking in that department  p its jealousy  plain and simple
robert could ve pointed out that tifa is a brawler lol
itseems like zoe was trying to be sarcastic or funny but failed miserably in the end.
zoe is the problem with the world  also  there is no love triangle in ffviI  this myth really needs to go.
I think  robert is making a very vage description of aerith and tifa and that makes it confusing to zoe...but  well  I didn t expect robert pattinson to be a final fantasy viI fan  and itshows in his face that he really enjoyed the game  that he really liked the story...basically I can see that he is a fan trying to explain it to somebody else but because of exitement doesnt get the point. for that pattinson has earned quite some points in my mind.
also mel you look absouletly stunning!
he did his best poor thing
the comment youread thatsaid  you look to be creating more divide . its odd  in my opinion  that wokies seem to think that  to not agree with their viewpoint 100   is being divisive. I feel like its only being divisive to have viewpoints which have no truth to them. I guess what Im trying to say is someone who disagrees with a belief or statement because it is untruthful in some way isn t being divisive. making statements or having beliefs which are not truth based is divisive. especially when the person knows it is untruthful. but I find it difficult to know if wokies actually believe what they re saying.did that make any sense
wow I said the same thing about this moment being cringy  before watching your video . zoe kravitz claiming a romantic choice between aerith and tifa in the final fantasy 7 videogame is a problem in the world  was cringy. people have chosen between many other people and decided who their romantic partner will be  zoe has some issues. michelle s cat woman with the whips was cool to me  maybe zoe will get them in the batman 2
saw tifa in the thumbnail and had to click.
you dont seem like a dungeons and dragons type of girl  but there s this class called  cleric  and those are typically the healing class. since dnd is a male dominated game  the healers tend to be male. tho Ive running this evil woman who just so happens to be a cleric  but thats aside the point
when she said dont fetishized her when she plays friken catwoman lol
not going to lie tifa especially the ff7 remake is for sure the best game girl.
I guess zone dont want to be healed when she  get injury.  so no doctors for her. lol
she s just obviously bitter and jealous that a man is not talking about her for 5 mins.
people like that make me think of those old shows and cartoons  when someone s speaking nonsense and you ve had enough they just say  aaaaaaahh shut up!
she was probably low key team jacob. remember when those girls chose which dudes they wanted to simp for
the reason why zoe kravitz has a problem with sexually appealing female characters is the power behind it. one it gives her something to compete against  two these are characters created to appeal to the male gaze for free. where someone like her wants to gate keep whom is allowed to look at her.
zoe  I hate tifa!me  yaaarrgh haar yippiddy a pirate site be always free!
stop letting words offend you  - based
ok  we ll rob chose the girl that is covered head to toe  shrug.
robert pattinson just became my favourite celebrity.
another great video
I have no idea who these people are  but that guy did actually seem genuinely excited and interested and she seems genuinely  profuse profanity redacted
zoe s gorgeous af so why she s sounding like a bitter and jealous girlfriend I do not know
cloud isn t in a love triangle  cloud is in a love square with tifa  aerith  and jesse.the only criticism I have about tifa is that if you have her in your party in the new remake  there is like a 1 3 chance the battle will end with her saying she needs a shower. started to sound excessive after a while.my other character to criticize  barrett is a terrible father figure but is delusional enough to constantly insist otherwise.
she was very typical smug about it too   like omg  . perfect sign of someone shielding their insecurities about their own body.
sorry but remake aerith absolutely steals the show.
maybe if she was a healer men would gawk at her too lol
I always main a healer...
is it a bit confusing  even since 97   thatsomebody in a terrorist cell has a tiny battle skirt  well  yeah. would ve just laughed it off as fanservice. and it is  dont get me wrong  but the design actually means something. tifa  from her looks  you d expect to be fully confident and sassy and flirty. but she s much more reserved and gentle. aerith is the one that acts like that  takes you around a bizarre date in wallmarket  while looking innocent and girly. you can interpret this as not judging people from first impressions  and also conveying the depth of your female party members. the magical girl  the innocent arbiter of purity  the one who will lead the party into the secret to save the world is an overdone trope. and while aerith is a sweet girl with the ability to activate holy  she is a flirty little minx  fanservice can annoy me when it completely goes against the character s role  why is a fantasy army leader only wearing a crop top and a skirt for armour  . but ff7 has a purpose for it.and the healing point  c mon. one party member who is female is the best healer. how she s approached this makes me think she didn t even want to discuss this  just shit on beloved characters for attention.
problematic  my ass
Im sorta jealous once in a while  but its entirely on me because I just generally suck at everything. but I never try to put people down. thats just fcked up.
gee zoe  I wonder why men prefer perky healers over some huffy and puffy  joyless  verging on bitter sow thatsits and rolls her eyes while someone brings up fond childhood memories  truly a mystery for the ages
now now. aerith is trying to heal a whole fucking planet  and tifa is the reason this was managed to be done. she literally saved the hero from himself and his depresion. havent been for her the world would have been fucked.
when I heard her say the whole  they said I was too urban for a role  during nohlan movies  I was like  sure that could be some messed up stuff  but the other part of me was thinking  is she just trying to boost her profile but pushing this narative now  I believe that my 2nd thought was legit. seems like she s trying to use the  odern-feminist  kick to boost her profile
there s the door zoey dont let it hit you on the way out js
I guarantee if she heard a man talking down about a female character because of a short skirt she would immediately call him a misogynist. zero principles. also  tifa is bae
its not just a word ether tho ...woke came from the people that really understood that we are veing hypnotized. I was one...but then it got transformed. words mean alot.
if she said something along the lines of how 99  of tifa character revolves around cloud  the male hero  and how thats her main personality trait I would agree to some degree  but she doesnt know this and is judging her just because she wears a short skirt and what make it funnier is thatshe is playing catwoman lol.the hypocrisy
sent a message on instagram with a scripture thats helped me in hard times. hopefully you check it eventually. keep doing what youre doing!
thanks for sharing this.
honestly  a lot of the side-characters in horizon  zero dawn outshine aloy as well. elisabet sobek  for one. one of the greats when it comes to female characters in gaming.
he really short-changed tifa though. she s much more than her looks.
I cant stop staring at those eyes.. they are really expressive..
your comments about the verse of the day strongly remind me of an actions of certain efinist who went into a rant saying how she hated being compared to the better looking previous host  and yes im talking about frosk
there is a big difference between jealousy and envy.
zoe is jealous because people are giving anime characters more attention than her.
honestly im tired of this thing  if a man likes something  we must ridiculize it and call him xyz namesalso I love how he mention   og   ffvii
only thing zoe is healing is her bank account and ego
zoe is already thinking of how she can both dump  and steal robert pattinson from that pretty girl he s been dating on and off recently . zoe is an insecure narcissist . she would destroy this man s soul if this ever happened. sinx ce I really dgaf about   I really hope him and zoe stick together   I dont care if she destroys him . hope she just stay away from rob . there is already an army of shippers trying to  canonize  their  attraction  .
technically  you can get yuffie  barret on the date also.
robert pattinson has gained points in my book for having taste. zoe kravitz dropped a few points for being a clich .
still not sure on pattinson playing batman  or the new batmobile  but have a new respect for him for his obvious love of ff7.zoe is hating on tifa though because she is a good looking female character that is strong  cant have both these days as you know with lara croft.
she got jelly because robert was gushing over and video game character.
zoe is just jealous because she knows all men would choose tifa or aerith over her.
I do find it cute that robert pattinson loves ff7  and was gushing about it to an obviously disinterested person  but he did a terrible job of selling both aeris and tifa. aeris is not the sweet healer girl  she s the slum rat with a good head on her shoulders and a tendency to take risks. tifa is the exact opposite  a country girl who is sweet  cautious and motherly who can also suplex giant monsters.
the actress  musician  writer  and now director has started living on her own terms.  just imagine if she d was not born into this rich family  she would be working in macdonalds for sure  girl have not all that talent at all  and its a machine of spell shit from the mouth
even though 6 is better than 7  Ive always been team tifa.
he was so into itso much excitement and she just shuts it down pathetic
I d like to offer the perspective thatshe s not being serious. she s being facetious at some level...some level of  meta   post  irony  exaggerated rolling of the eyes...smiling while she says it. those may be signs she s not completely serious. like she s playing a character in the interview. will also note that they played around a lot in the interviews they did together.or maybe she s 100  completely genuine.
aerith s last limit break was such a hack that Im convinced it would ve made the game so much easier had she survived. but of course it makes no difference to zoe. its just  so because she s a woman she needs to heal everyone  ... I dont know if I should be amazed or depressed by such a lack of nuance. going mainstream was a mistake  can we go back to geek culture being unpopular  underestimated and ignored please
I love healing. in ffxiv I was a healer myself and Im the worst thing in the world  a straight white male lol.
it would have been funny if zoe was wearing a short skirt during the interview  as she complains about a video game character having a short skirt.
love your vids
I really dont get how we allow people to shame women fictional or real based on being well endowed
oh Lord.. I have a feeling poor az wont like this news.
so sad  one of them is happy and exciting and the other is simply toxic and bitter.  Imean... people scream   slay girl slay  for strong women who are doctors  what do you think a healer is   !!! xd
im not too stuck up about dressing up for church  but I do think you should.  you are presenting yourself to God and I think it is a nice gesture to him that you come to worship him clean  and dressed nicely.  many people think you must wear a suit  tie  and jacket which im not down with.  I do think you should be clean and look nice though.  when I was a teen  I would go with a hendrix shirt  sandals  long hair and high.  I went to a church that was the type that looked down upon you if you didnt have a dress on for females and suit and tie for guys  but I had a great pastor then  hes dead now  and he would always shake my hand with a smile and said he was glad to see me.  he was so genuine and loving.  he was the first to see me when I went to jail and he didnt preach or try and parent me.  he just prayed  told me a little about his wild days  laughed  and said when I get out we need to have a steak.  man he was such a good guy.  he wanted the suit and tie  but he knew how to make me feel welcome and to just keep coming back.  that man literally changed my life.
they snuck some woke bs into batman didn t they  and here I was looking to support pattison he seems like a genuinely good guy
I heard he was friends with trump  I like robert I think he lies in every interview
areith and tifa has alot of personally and depth then catwoman bruh lol
this is a problem I have with  popular  women in hollywood. they start hating on other good looking women for wearing something revealing or being sexual and its the same thing they re doing themselves! the  its okay when I do it   theme which is such bs. its a big reason Ive been turned off american products is seeing people like this.
oh well another movie not to be give my money too awesome
its fine  tifa is part of the italian senate now  she needs a break from final fantasy so she could be part of someone else s.
she just wanted to be the center of attention and the second the attention is shifted towards someone else  game over.
I haven t been interested on seeing newbatman movie.always remember melonie you are  by are heavenly father.I absolutely  that you put scriptures in your videos keep it goingplease. takecare melonie
I was gonna say men can be healers to... but then I realised  re do  probably wont help my argument.
idk bout you fellas but if Im hurt and bout to die I dont want bubba taking care of me.
wait.. so zoe is mad about short skirts and healers  yet she is playing catwoman.. a notoriously sexy character and thats fine because she s the one doing it  I hate how it is okay for one woman to be sexy  but as soon as another woman they dont like or a character from any form of media dresses sexy they flip out. itseems like a self-esteem problem on their part. also the way she puts him down for being so excited is awful. you can see him gradually get less excited the more she bashes it. she and other woke people are the reason I am okay with gatekeeping.
when it comes to tifa from final fantasy 7 and final fantasy 7 remake. I like tifa original outfitsadly only video game mods for pc version can bring back tifa original outfit.
robert patterson spent years being hated for twilight and refusing to get into shape for batman  only to potentially become another henry cavil level chad while that chick is on the fast track to becoming another sarkessian level target among gamers.
damn patriarchy assuming women are all doctors healing everyone!arieth literally has the best ultimate in the game  she gives invincibility. tifa is a highly skilled boxer.
she just mad that even aerith has a bigger bust than she does
you can definitely tell one grew up rich.
she must be fun at parties.
tbf thats a pretty poor description of tifa lol. she is so much more than a  sexy  character in a miniskirt  like being empathetic  awesome and kicks ass.
I dont think they called themselves  woke . I think others called them that. I guess its cool if you want to keep using  woke  and  based  wrong. more importantly  zoe is wild for hating on ffviI girls when she knows absolutely nothing about it. Im not surprised though. here s hoping the batman is good though. kinda looking forward to it.
she s acting like one of those girls who mocks their bf s for their nerdy geeky hobbies and passions because she doesnt get it  try saying similar stuff to what she enjoys and then you will be the a  hole for sure
who knew robert paterson was so based vs the virgin zoe kravitz who basically plays a character who uses her femininity to her advantage.... I am scared about this new batman movie but if she s barely in it and it mostly focuses on batman going after penguin and the riddler  then Im sold
Ive never been more proud to say that I have absolutely no diea who youre talking about!
lol right ! there s something amazing and powerful about a nurturing woman.
tbf Im pretty sure he was just trolling with the refusing to get in shape thing lol
I think the not getting in shape thing wasn t real and he actually put in the work
@shaun jay and youre entitled to your opinion bro
she s thatstrong whaman you d be rolling your eyes at. just like how she s rolling her eyes here.
I have to wonder if people like zoe are being advised by publicists to be shitty people.  tweet this  and get the internet mad. but thats a good thing  because your name will stay in the public sphere. bad press is still press!
there is only one black woman to play cat woman and its the beautiful eartha kit. may she rest in peace.
question. what is the origin of  based   I think it might be  based in reality .
she hates woman being an assist or healer  she probably wants the brute strength type of female character  you know  strong female   tifa is there though  and yuffie
zoe kravitz complains about a character in a skirt  while she walks around naked in public. the level of hypocrisy there is breaking my hypocrisy measuring instruments.
imo  women hate when men find female characters in games movies books attractive because it is competition for male attention. even if a woman wouldn t want anything to do with a given man  she would rather he was pining fruitlessly after her because it gives her power over him.
the biggest irony of all is that tifa was created to be an example of a feminist woman to the japanese female audience.  she s not the useless girl who just waits to be saved.  you can notice that a lot of the shit introduced by the revolutionaries and that helped to create women like zoe appears precisely in ffvii.  feminism  environmentalism  racism and class struggle are just a few examples of garbage that has destroyed people s minds over the years and that appears in this game  purposely to also make the japanese minds.yes. that a bit of the truth behind this game.
no one tell zoe kravitz about mercy from overwatch.
I would buy a cookbook.have you seen paul saladino s comments about chicken being bad for you as only cows pig can break down bad fats in corn you can see a short rehash here https   www.youtube.com watch v zf2dpdn_60yI loooove chicken  but if its unhealthy if they eat corn I worry about nutrional value   for weightloss
healers are awesome!!and I also like girls with minI skirts. I think that makes me......a man   woke people will use anything normal against us.....so sad they are twisting every good thing.
kravitz is a product of the holywood system and robert is a legit nerd of ffviithis is why people like her should be gatekept from gamingif she wasn t acting she d be an activist
envy  the deadly sin type is also known as invictus. its different from  say  admiring a person s outfit and saying   Im so jealous  thats such an amazing outfit!  plus  there is a righteous sort of jealousy that we have for God  and God has for us  which is mentioned in exodus when God gives moses the ten commandments. however  the deadly sin envy of invictus is something like the jealousy that came over cain and led to him murdering his brother abel. judas  before betraying our Lord displayed this similar invictus jealousy when he griped at the expensive oil being lavished on Jesus. thatsaid  invictus envy that is deadly is type  that if you let it eat at you and act on it  can lead to malicious intent upon others. we could probably come up with more modern examples  but its for the best to work out one s own salvation  and thus not dwell on where other people are at too much to where you feel you need to doxx them or otherwise ruin their lives.
sorry  that cat stole the show. did you consider making it a cohost
he should ve said something like   yeah  women healing the world is very toxic the character should ve had your ability to spread misery and loathing instead .
zoe done f    up everything.
just here to be supportive and boost the algorithm thing.oh  and to be honest Im wondering if you might be immortal. itseems like you do not age!
and both characters are bad ass. aerith is way more than a healer  and tifa is a boxer.
it doesnt matter to her what the characters were like she would find it bad anyway because its not her
to be fair  she was clearly completely ignorant about ff7 and only could respond to what patterson was saying based on his description  and that description was maybe the most shallow way you could describe the tifa arieth love triangle.  its a choice between a healer and a sexy video game girl . not  its a choice between your children friend who grew up into a strong rebel and barkeep  and this spiritually sensitive flower girl who brings life to the lifeless slums the fact thatshe s conditioned to get disgusted with and would shut a guy talking about a thing he loves in an interview with just  healer and sexy woman  still isn t great  but maybe we can go a little easier on her for not knowing more than that.
I still dont get how tifa lockhart became italian.  Imean  is there an italy in the world of final fantasy
something was shown with her in it in a certain way during a zoom meeting that was hacked with the senate and it became a meme thats all I ll say.
pattinson didnt even explain the game correctly tho....
I fail to see how being a healer is a negative thing. supporting people  defending people and keeping hurt people alive is one of the most honorable things a person can do. ever hear of doctors and nurses  most people wouldn t live very long without them. male healers are also a thing in almost every jrpg so its not a gender issue either.
rahscene  I choose my words short  soft   sweet if I were you  otherwise youre gonna be eatin  em through a straw
great. this is the type of person robert has to work around. thats probably another batman thats not sticking around. and who could blame him
based pattinson calls her aeris.
pattinson must have some sort of feminism-tune-out ability cause he never really lost his good mood even as she s actively being cancer inches away from him. feel sorry for the guy that he couldn t geek out in a more sympathetic space away from sociopaths like zoe.
I feel like some people now just get mad anytime a fictional character in a game is attractive. or anytime a girl is busty. as if these women dont exist in real life and arnt allowed to exist. and its not like male characters arnt treated in a similar way in games. tough  strong  and ripped. lol. call me crazy. but characters should be able to be however the artist wants to depict them.   p
anyone else wanna let our girl know about holy
which is why rob should gift her a ps5 with the ff7r game hahah
daisy wears shorts that low-cut when golfing or playing tennis.
hmm  tifa and aerith are world famous  doesnt this child of famous people know this  maybe I ll go get the beautiful gal brianna  over at  strange rebel gaming   who s the voice of aerith in the ff viI remake to comment on this. girl when through civilian marine boot camp- and really improved. she s a bag  imo. bad. ass. girl. I ll be passing on catwoman- how good can it be  with opinions like that.
yeah  I was thinking the same thing - how canthis broad who literally played catwoman really get upset about aerith and tifa   they are iconoclast characters along the same lines as catwoman  but for a different genre.  literally both very strong female characters  yet there s a problem cuz whah-men.
u know its downhill from here when youre jealous of a video game character .. who doesnt exist.
short skirt and a melee brawler kick-ass barista avalanche just chillin  in her basement   problems in the world.she just seem to be a lovely  agreable and level headed person to work with. she doesnt let him finish his explanation and dismiss the whole thing while robert is clearly all giddy up and happy to talk about something he cares about. thats just sad and pathetic. nothing more.
I know of people who chose a black character and he got shit for itsince he did not look like that in real life I am like is this real
her opinion means nothing to me. robert s  on the other hand  is such a bro. I would love to talk to him about video games!
zoe kravitz has literally been hired due to her looks  her status as lenny kravitz daughter  and maybe her acting....though she s pretty much playing the same person in every role.the audacity of the self absorbed thought process that these kinds of people have is infuriating.and the data we ve collected on dating apps   long term studies has made it clear that almost 90  of the women will always go for the top 10  of men. which means that yes  if you are a man in that top 10   you literally have your pick of women throwing themselves at you. robert pattinson is one and he is clearly speaking from experience.
lana rain can cosplay as really good tifa yeahyeyeyeye! you dont look like 30 to me you look 20   _   _   but glory to ukraine !!!!!!!
its almost like she had no way to contribute to the conversation so she resorted to base level woke.that is the only positive possibility for this  is thatshe doesnt really care but the only resource to pull from to contribute is the hollywood woke toolbox and she pulled the most applicable tool.I dont know much about her so Im not familiar with how she talks  but its telling of society that I d be betting more on her just being some woke numbskull as opposed to just trying to be involved in the conversation having no knowledge of the topic.
zoe was killed off scene in x-men days of futures past  so Im not turn up about it
lol she ll probabaly throw it out the window out of jealousy cause the models for f ar e gorgeous. cloud is prettier than her. and the characters and story is amazing glad f doesnt have a zoe strong whaman character
@npc Im knot
figure this   she heard the most basic  stereotypical description of any video game girl ever  healer  and  short skirt .  how is the response not going to be what it was   if tifa s description was  beats monsters and robots up with her fists  Im sure the response would ve been different.  but we have healer  short skirt  love triangle.  thats as basic as it gets.
I already didn t like this lady so this doesnt really change my opinion of her.  in her defense  Im old so I doubt Im her demographic anyway.  I have to admit though  my opinion of that twilight fella has vastly improved.  not that it could do anything but improve  but still...
you said your favorite feature on yourself is your arms. I would tell you what my favorite feature on you is...but you would probably slap me.  that is just meant to be humorous. i.e. a joke
Imean to be fair rob didn t excatly give her the greatest description of eather characters.but even so that reaction was pretty horrendous.Ive just come to terms with this crap after all this time lol
she doesnt get to have an opinion. she just made her name off the back of her dad so her opinion literally counts for zero. she s never lived in the real world.
2 things in this world that the woke will learn the hard way that you dont mess with is lotr and ffvii.
I like how she ll bash ff7 for having woman embody everything modern feminism hates but more than likely wont bother to learn the story behind the characters or take the time to connect to the characters.
its called  being a hypocrite
also you went indepth about your diet but why no fish  usually my daily course is a beef bison brick  chicken or salmon which I consider the more nutritious choice. I need to include rice or beans to not feel hungry so its not all carnivore  just dont think rice has exactly had a part in attacking people s lifespans.
ok well now its personal
I dropped your channel name on russell brands channel so expect a ton of subscribers  he has 5.11 million subscribers so I though other normal people would like you as well.
I despise the thats the problem with the world. honey  there s about 9 047 639 638 524 726 779 336 720 problems in our world and no its not japanese anime videogames. kravitz is definitive elite platinum spoon baby. she was born into wealth with a career paved for her at birth.
no one cares about zoe  she was literally seething over robert loving a video game
rules for thee but not zoe.my ff title that makes me geek out is ff iv  american ff iI . rydia is a complete bad ass and arguably the most powerful character of them all.
so I take it zoe kravitz has never done a nude scene because it would go against her feminist views .we re in the game tifa punched the shit out of enemy
as long as these  celebrities  and their opinions dont actually mess with my games and my gaming experience  then they can say whatever they want. zoe was cool in the batman irony but she s not a game reviewer  not one I rely on for decent critique at least.
all I got from this is that robert might be a man of culture  while zoe comes off as a typical bitter feminist.also tifa still best girl both classic and remake she still my video game crush to this day.keep up the amazing work melonie!!!
Lord save us all
man its bad enough people think fictional characters are too sexy. just leave tifa and aerieth alone
hey  I haven t played ff viI remake yet
I disagree with that. both of those 2 female characters cant be healers and one of them would be more like fighters. also being a male war time medic or healer could be cool and has been. this is obviously zoe claiming a wrong position. everybody has preferences and will choose a person with more of their desirable qualities than another person
@anonymous rando  that has nothing to do with the context of what the woman heard and how she reacted based on what she heard  or how she might have reacted if she had been given more information.based on what she s given  you have a choice between a healer and a girl in a short skirt  if a movie could be broken down like this  you d have a bad movie.  it makes sense that if a game s characters are simply  healer  and  short skirt   you d have a bad game.  take duke nukem s latest game.   male bimbo  or  80s action hero with no charisma.    dumb guy with guns.    muscles for brains. youre stating she s claiming a wrong position based on information she couldn t possibly have.  she s not claiming a position  she s making a statement that the choices suck if thats all those two characters were.  your own statement also possesses incorrect incomplete information.  you can set both of the characters to work as healers  so yes they can both be healers.   versus your statement of how they cant both be healers  in fact when aerith dies  tifa became my healer .  you can also set up aerith as a solo fighter  in both the original and the remake .  as such both of them can also be fighters.and then ultimately  the  everybody has preferences ... has absolutely nothing to do with the comment youreplied to.  my comment had nothing to do with preferences or how the characters needed to be played  but how one could get a better reaction by using a better description than  short skirt  as tifa s sole only exclusive character trait.imagine if cid s only defining character trait was he s white.  person 1   the romance options in this game are really compelling  there s the guy who uses a sword  and then there s cid  he s white and Im like I cant decide. other person   is that really all they are   what kind of choices are these for men  either I could have a sword or be white  so uh  my entire comment is on a reaction based on information the person received meaning the entire construct of the comment youre replying to is acknowledging that the person we are discussing  zoe  does not possess the knowledge we have on the subject matter and wouldn t know that the game gives the ability to choose character roles or have the freedom to ignore roles altogether.  zoe  as a non-gamer  also makes several reasonable assumptions based on the extremely limited information provided  something literally anyone would make while on the wrong end of not knowing shit.you ve also  kinda pulled a zoe here.
I never said no fish. I eat shrimp and fish regularly.
to be fair  zoe probably doesnt even know how tifa and aerith look like.little ms. feminist got triggered because of the way robert nerded out about them.
zoe is woke so no way ill support anything she is in.
I wasn t going to see the next batman movie before this. now Im never going to watch it.
on women healing everyone  materia made itso everyone could be a healer in ff7. I will defend that game to someone like that despite not being much of a fan of it because that take is so uninformed.
snub is ineffective
if you dont want aerith to heal take the cure materia off her and  put it on cloud then you get a  soldier who heals. not to mention tifa is one of the strongest damage characters in the game   both games. let s examine final fantasy 7 characters tifa  one of the strongest physical attackers in the game. yuffie  a ninja... enough said. aerith the best magic users and healer in the game. now let s look at the male characters caitsoth vincent cid all useless. barrett  is useful for his range that is it. cloud is it decent all rounder til his last limit brrak. damn the patriarchy!also complain about  stereotypes  while you wear a skin tight leather suit  who has seductress as a main character trait. then get mad because people look at you sexually... she hasn t  but probably will .
social pts for her in crowd hollywood in crowd. zoe s take just makes me yawn.
oh I wont pay for batman  thanks for the info.
there s a certain irony in a woman who plays a comic book character  bashing videogame characters  and more or less shitting on nerds.nerds is the reason a third batman franchis is even considered a good idea.
I think maybe she was joking and it didn t land
Im trying to get my younger sister to try your diet cus she s really skinny and she wants to not be a pencil but as of yet she wont try it  I ll keep working on her though cus I think it would work and so far nothing has.
she wasn t jealous.  its a narcissist thing.  she just wanted to demean it for sjw cred and do it while he was describing it.  so...narcissist imo.
its okay. aerith and tifa doesnt give a f    about her anyway. lol.
healing considered weak.. Jesus.. said no one ever.. until now.. and tifa who  in my opinion  is the best played part about ff7 remake and also destroys as in hand to hand combat. idk how you can get more masculine than that. show this girl the tifa fight in advent children
haters gonna hate. ainters gonna ain t
feminists must be such joys to be around and so happy with themselves.... clearly by listening to zoe for more than 12 seconds.
its always funny when the woman who dont like when female characters wear anything remotely skimpy  have photos where they are wearing skimpier clothing next to nothing in public.oh no Imight become team edward lol.I love tifa she is awesome. but healers are awesome. like in paladins itso hard to win without healers in that game.
brie larsen called. she wants her attitude back from one zoe kravitz.
healers are way more useful than bards.
you wear flare leggings  what are you from 1999 honestly Imiss flare jeans  the butt was still tight as can be  but it had that retro 1976 look that resurfaced in the late 90s-06
he undersold tifa. she fought with her bare hands. in a world of swords  guns  and magic  she punched people.
I wish I could find a church I could get into. I think its the fact that its organized that bothers me so much  I feel like its directly opposite of what Jesus actually taught
zoe kravitz is a token hire.
I always ask myself the question why some people try to disgrace and destroy old buildings and unique architecture from the past  as those things have nothing to do with their personal opinion or hate about religion. all nuts  this world
aerith is the trad queen
clearly no--one is more successful than melonie because they re more attractive
zoe needs Jesus- a man who heals everybody- to heal her.
she has issues and needs to stop being jealous of animated female charactersedit  5 29 wait  wait he wasn t even talking about the remake and she was already b ching when she doesnt even know anything about the franchise  characters or even their lore or the lore of final fantasy viI   wait isn t she the same one that write the comic about the mom whose power is her menstrual cycle  cuz if so she s very detached  just saying  t
tbh robert massively oversimplified them.
I really hope he sparkles
hmm this was not as bad as I thought  he did a poor job explaining the characters imo. she didn t need to be so dismissive about it but she should have played it off.
my question is  why do people dislike healers   do they not wanna be a hero  or do they want people to die   like  girl or guy ones nothing wrong. when I used to play fps games like seige or ow I used to main mercy  mostly bastion but thats beside the point   doc and mostly recently thunderbird  my favorite character . I dont see or understand the issue  like why     who cares if its usually a woman isn t that a good thing  and even if a character is sexy is that wrong  unless its a child  or meant to be overly sexualized then yeah thats a problem  but what s wrong with sexy  bayonetta is a good example of using sexy to advantage and making it work also lara croft and even more  I swear people who have high status or are just on the internet confuse me.
liked  for the zoe- tifa aerith stuff. sub d  when I saw the Christian woke comments. bell d  when I saw the votd.
zoe is crapping on something she has no clue about. there s a great depth to the story and characters of ff7. some of the best in all of gaming and set up sp much for the future of games. its amazing someone who is supposed to be creative and in an industry about story telling is this oblivious.
get ready for zoe to be the next brie larson. she s gonna act like she carried the entire dceu after this movie makes its 1st dollar.
also the way they whine about healers...they re basically whining about female healers saving everyone including males imagine the situation being reversed and how their whining would change to  ugh  poor women always need men healing them in these mysogynistic games!
for some reason  I like pattinson more and kravitz less after that clip. Im actually looking forward to the batman!
no fun allowed!
wow  what a burden  to have to see characters of your gender constantly able to do grand feats of positivity that mend the minds and bodies of those around them.I feel like whatever character you bring up she would have a problem with it. itsounds like she s just trying to be that  dickish contrarian  archetype and  as an actual contrarian myself  Im a bit offended.
and people question why I have no interest in the glittery batmans.
zoe lacks imagination and a sense of wonder.
he didn t do a good job of explaining the girls but she was a bitch. both are good options but tifa was best girl in ff7. for me it was a toss up between tifa and celes from ff6 for best girl in series.
media  men should open up and be more sincere media  uuuuuh we dont want to talk about your dumb videogames  dont get offended you are really emotional are you not a man !
I got no issues with zoe. but frankly  she shouldn t be complaining about the roles of females in video games. as someone who isn t even deep in ff lore  I only know some of the story elements from the most recent ff7 remake game  she of all people cannot talk about problems with a game series like final fantasy because I doubt she knows the first thing about the games. and she shouldn t be talking about sexualization of women in entertainment. considering she is playing a character who is known to use her sex appeal as a method to obtain what she desires. and  like you mentioned  she wears sexy  revealing outfits to big events. but she wanna get upset because a girl is wearing a skirt that being said  I am excited to see her and pattinson in batman.
she probably just wanted to act all cool and blas   like  ugh  men and their silly video games  amiright    but came off really dismissive and unlikeable instead  lol.
tbh  I love ff7 but I never found this infuriating. she s never heard of the game so she doesnt understand anything all about it nor the characters. I was more excited to see rob nerd out.
I d like to point out his description of tifa and aerith was atrocious. her response to the description of aerith  yeah that was terrible. its like she was reaching desperately for something to be upset about. but his description of tifa was  she wore a short skirt . putting aside its just shorts.... thats how you describe her  especially in the concept of the love triangle  you give aerith the quality  healer  but tifa gets  short skirt . its fine to rag on her for her bad take but dont let him slide on that.
no one ever talks about jesse
I never thought zoe was the right choice for catwoman.  to me she s not only wrong for the part  but in the trailers  itseemed like she and pattinson had absolutely no chemistry.  michelle pfeiffer is as close as we ve gotten to a live action version  and so far  no one else has come close.  sadly  its not surprising thatshe responded the way she did.  she s just another hollywood hypocrite who takes sexy roles  and leaks porn of herself  and then turns around and virtue signals.
yups woke snobbywood at its finest
tifa s fighting style is basically that of a monk...let thatsink in for a moment. also take note how she was the main character while cloud was in a coma  but nah  let s forget about that because being appealing to straight men makes her nothing more than a fighting fuck toy which is totally okay to say about women you dont like...just ask a feminist.
he should have also mentioned that aerith was also the chosen one.
yey!!! melonie mac gtrat see ya on here  im a huge long-time fan of urs and ur facebook streams   contemt  I definatley without question just hit the subscribe!  definatley a joy see ya
as a girl who loved all the women in ff7  and have always liked when female characters have the cutest armor outfits  even the sexy ones like tifa  I found this super annoying.
I heard  poor antifa heals people .xd
zoe doesnt know anything about ff so I really dont care what she has to say about it. still looking forward to seeing the batman movie.
sexist men are bad for gender equality  but feminists are right up there too. so many feminists dont realize that when you try and say female characters shouldn t be in certain outfits or fill certain rolls youre limiting them just as much as the males who always put those characters in those roles and outfits to begin with. a true feminist wouldn t have a problem with a girl filling a certain role because the idea of gender equality is that anyone can serve any role regardless of gender. a lot of girls who played this game probably related to one of the two characters that zoe thinks is pandering to gender norms and thats what important  not the fact that zoe  who herself plays one of these cliches in catwomen  didn t see anything she could relate to or respect about them.
why did she act like that  a female character isn t allowed to be able to heal her companions  what s the problem here  she probably wants female representation in video games  but when there are representations of women thats not useless that both boys   girls love  she denies those female characters. bloody hell.
zoe kravitz  the definition of a self-made woman  thinks that the problem with the world is 25 year old video game love interests.wow....
hey mel I just want to say that zoe and some other celebs say some dumb things that us   other people disagree with and so that is why celebs dont know what to say in a good way to other people that want to have them agree on when they are talking bout something that what they want to talk bout  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that and let you know that too  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok mel.
the veneer on doublespeak is really wearing thin for me. I dont want to support anything they do. I like patterson  but count me out.
not to mention he called her a thief..... I think he genuinely confused tifa and yuffie
cause she s forgettable in the original game. she didn t get any real character development until the remake.
only due to the fact thatshe let cloud keep going because of his ptsd.
to be fair  his explanation of ffxiI was a little crude and rudimentary  so I wont judge her based on thatsnipet of an explanation. alll of us know how absurdly in-depth that game is. talking about it for 3 mins and expecting her to get it is a bit unfair.  though I suspect  even if she knew the whole tale she would find some faults in the female portrayal and damn the patriarchy and all that jazz. plus  people can be painfully unaware of their own hypocrisy. I bet she would argue that  chainmail  see through dress she was wearing was  tasteful nudity .
aerith was more wizard than healer.  give her the right materia and she hits like a truck. I find her rush to judgements ironic  you shouldn t accuse the devs of making hasty generalizations while making hasty generalizations.
rules for thee but not for me as the saying goes  these kinds of ladies also seem to be shocked when men dont want to be around that miserable negativity and bashing of what they like. all the good men are gone am I right  xd
well these characters that zoe is talking about are more real than her feminist and racist bull crap she s always spitting! Im not even a final fantasy fan but hearing zoe talk crap just pisses me off!
halle berry   I was the worst cast as catwoman zoe kravitz   hold my race swap you white privileged a  holes
just goes to show how judgemental she is if she s going to write off two extremely meaningful characters based on a crude description alone. now thats the real problem with the world.
I dont know that robert was explaining it terribly well. but yeah  she was right away being negative and taking a bit of a woke  feminist stance on it.  this is what s wrong with the world.  yeah  no  sweetheart. there are things in the world far worse than video games.
this is how women behave if a man shows interest in anything other than her.  its an instant turnoff to everyone around them.
you do realize that aerith as a character is modeled after the vila or vilia--slavic water damsels--and approximates someone born in russia and raised in the states   and that her innocent guise belies sensuality decrying such a character while trying to play a character known for some level of sensuality seems stupid enough.  someone fed her the talking point for publicity reasons.  after all  celebrities are tasked with looking good so they can endorse stuff.and  in the process  they look bad.all aerith wants to sell is a pretty little easter lilly.  thats all we need to know!
zoe looks at the world through a feminist lens.    in other words   blind.
melanie  on your church advice  dont you think the question should be wether it is the true church  remember  our Lord only started one church.
the whole classic dnd class cleric is a male healer.  kravitz is an extreme leftist wingnut.  she is jealous of tifa and aeris.
this interviews like chalk and cheese
ok    for pattison and - for kravitz. I never cared for either of them but mad respect for his ff7 love. the way zoe handled that interview was so just disrespectful and indicative thatshe doesnt care or know anything about the game.edit  oh yeah  and at least tifa   aerith didn t get turned into androgynous man-women in the ff7 remake. and with the way its shaping up  looking like aerith isn t going to be dying in this one.
healers are important  allhealerslivesmatter
I feel like its kind of important to point out that while her reaction definitely isn t  the vibe   so to speak  she s not reacting to the actual game or characters of ff7. she s reacting to a very brief  and kinda shallow description of something by pattinson. like ok yea  ff7...its this love triangle between you  a kind healer  and a feisty girl in a skirt. not exactly a world class account lol. so sure  it would be nice if her reaction was more of a probing one  rather than dismissive  but again  this doesnt equate to her actually attacking  or being offended by ff7.
re  church - the most important thing to look out for is heresy.  church  is a waste of time  no matter how it makes you feel  if it isn t teaching actual Christianity. today  most of these type of  churches  have gone woke  compromising dogma to be of the world  a few of them have gone the other way and dont preach love. a quick test is to examine the church s stance on homosexuality. if you get the westboro baptist church stuff  find something else. if you find a church that celebrates homosexuality  it has compromised with the world. you want a church that doesnt spend a lot of time talking about it at all  but when it does  it preaches compassion to and tolerance of individuals  framing the issue with something like   we are all sinners  so let s look inward first. have you disrespected your mother or father  have you coveted another man s wife  have you not been your brother s keeper  have you given alms  do you feel self-satisfied when you give alms   stuff like that.
nothing wrong with tank tops. show off them arms  they have kick ass tattoos on them
I like how robert pointed out  alot of details   I notice how nervous he was about sharing this information  most likely because of all the time he spent with zoe  who seems to be a disgusting feme-nazI who hates anything a guy says about women  unless it perfectly matches her religion of hate   pride  like he said  its a love triangle  one girl is feminine   is a healer  the other is masculine   a fighter  cloud chooses the feminine one  sis I wish he said that to heron a separate note  zoe is most likely going for woke points from her hollywood masters   yes she is a hypocrite  but I stand with the Bible  there s nothing wrong with a woman sharing her body with her husband  instead of the world  modesty is about being humble   treating your body like a church  you dont strip a church  you dont abuse a church    you dont look to the world to validate a church. that has nothing to do with jealousy  or envy  its being a humble servant of God  only those full of pride obsess over there appearance.matthew 6 31-33 31 so do not worry  saying   what shall we eat   or  what shall we drink   or  what shall we wear   32 for the pagans run after all these things  and your heavenly father knows that you need them. 33 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness  and all these things will be given to you as well.
I wonder if she talks crap about nurses.
agree with your take on the nerd boy. agree with your eye roll. agree with your pointing out her hypocrisy on skirt. disagree with you saying zoe is attractive.
hollywood hypocrites in a nutshell.
sounds like she s jealous.
lukewarm acting  born into fame  still lands a role and then complains about not getting roles where another block woman got the role  and now jealous of fictional characters
oh my gosh her attitude is horrible like let him talk about ff7 for real she just kept interrupting him it was infuriating he was just expressing his passion and here she comes killing the mood  eye roll . I bet she does not even know anything about how nostalgic that game is and the characters. but also ive always liked tifa more  3
control stroll up to make picture larger   hope I am not mansplanning
it annois me when people judge something in 5 second when they dont know annything about the story or charcs it kind of shows thatshe is verry judgemental and she doesnt even ask who they are what they are about or says ya il check them out later no inmidiate bashing.aerith and tifa are iconic and so what if she wears a short skirt zoe wears a bikina on the beach thats even worse.aerith is a headstrong healer nope healing is bad and tifa is a strong female fighter nope short shirt wel youl burn through allot of good charcs that way wel how about sephiroth nope he looks like a she-male I bet she would say that or something in that direction.not to bash her to much but I have found out in the last years that allot of celebs are not so nice as the media says and they often contradict themselves.haah the ironie I like the vids I seen so far and youre on a mostly meat diet  and I am a vegan God has a sense of humor    I wil sub for now because you have some good content mind you I just found youre channel a fuw days ago so wil see.
waiiiit you Christian    sister!! so cool!! Im a worship leader. good to see a Christian content creator on youtube!!
fwiw   here is an image showing  both sides  of that mesh dress ms. kravitz is shown wearing  from the back  in this video  https   pagesix.com wp-content uploads sites 3 2021 09 zoe-kravitz-007.jpg quality 90 strip all
I worked a job with about 15-20 women in my department. we would all take lunch in the break room. and I would play my hand held game system. the air was vacuumed out of the room   they started talkin such crap about me. I dont think men  especially grown men  are allowed to enjoy games in the presence of non-gamer girls women. sad.
hey  Im perfectly fine with any women who want to heal me. uh  purely for ya know  if Im like bleeding or something. and nothing else. anywho...
gonna say it  it needs to be said  melonie mac   zoe kravitz
Jesus .....was a healer..........
Im glad the  chicken wire  dress trend hasn t spread over to men. jeez its borderline exhibitionism when women on the red carpet do it. but if itsomehow comes to men  I think people would react very different.
zoe making a big deal out of nothing. wonder if she ever gets indigestion from all those nothingburgers.
zoe dear  its not thatserious. way to make a mountain from a grain of sand. it was not even a grain of anything to begin with!.
lol yeah zoe  it was way better when women weren t allowed to be doctors. we should totes go back to that.
non-denominational is great.
nina and momo   tifa and aerith. bofiiI   ffviicome at me bro.
commenting to feed the algorithm

zoe obviously isn t a gamer
melonie how dare you go to church for worship and not to compare clothing.
same vibes as brie larson in interviews. she always has make herself look  strong   but really she comes off as a full of herself and mean.
boom boom .
maybe she s just really method... imagine catwoman being catty
she acts as if most nurses aren t women. also  she didn t need to be so patronizing toward thatsituation.
whos zoe again
eh  michelle pfeiffer will always be my catwoman.
healing is for wahman
I wish zoe kravitz would get away.  I wish she would fly away  yeah  yeah  yeah.
yeah  pattinson   kravitz aka dumb   dumber
should watch tfs final fantasy 7 machinabridge.
she only wishes thatshe could be as relevant as aerith   tifa.
I still dont know what the  comment etiquette  is. I feel like I comment too much but I have thoughts as the video plays out. is there some kind of  comment etiquette
thank God Im not the only one who found zo  s comments unwarranted and gross
irl women gets jelous of tifa ..I see that happen before... and women do idealize too.. man are more honest most times
strong brie larson vibes.
what a hypocrite! the real problem is how people like her view things that were never a problem to begin with. last I checked  healing is a good talent to have when saving a life.
kravitz doesnt know a damn thing about ff vii
and I really wanted to see his batman. but I will not support her
comment as often as you like  it helps my channel and I love reading them  so no complaints here
and I thought  the problem with the whole world  was a war in ukraine  fuel prices  rising costs  natural disasters and a pandemic.  but no... tifa s skirt is the problem...
talk about hypocrite. she is literally doing an interview about a movie where her character is dressed up as a catwoman in skin tight leather.
zoe kravitz is no fun at all I guess.
woke   walk away.
before she call aerith n tifa the problem with the world. she is doing the same shit. why r u doing the same shit u find problematic
she looks like a female elliot rodgers. I thought this before ever knowing anything about her.
I dont see what the fuss is about  she knows nothing of the characters or game  and if someone said the love triangle is a major plot in the game. and described the two girls as  the healer and sexy thing in a short skirt  my desire to play such game would be kinda low  like damn thats it  there s nothing else enticing about these characters cept one heals and the other wears a skirt.
we cant have anything discord is ded too
I was becoming confused every time someone said  and tifa  itsounds too much like  antifa . I have more I want to say but will say it as a separate comment.
least now I know to skip out on the batman since I dont indulge woke ass celeb hot takes
loved the batman movie  but zoe kravitz opinion is so stupid...robert pattinson on the other hand... total awesome man.
I swear base people have nothing better to b than about lol  yall talk about zoe not knowing ff7. yall dont know about zoe kravitz. she s always deeply sarcastic and when she doesnt know about something  she fills in the gap with snarky wit. its just her. everyone says shit that doesnt get digested right in the moment. gtfover it
is zoe kravitz a huge gamer or something  is that why she is on a show with a couple of guys talking about final fantasy 7  Imean  if she is not a gamer  this seems like it would be a normal take from a woman who is not a gamer.
oh my God its like the girl from cowboy bebop all over again. also Im tired of this double standard ladies do you think they make marvel movies where the guys take their shirts off for men no its for women
pretty disappointing to see the actress jump at the first thing to complain about  and point out something that will no doubt be seen as a negative in today s  social climate. tiring to see how many just go with that garbage for some woke points.
aloy got much more bad a   and forbidden west versus zero dawn
who the fuck is zoe kravitz
Im not a fan of hers  I dont know her but....y know..I watched the clip in its entirety. its really taken out of context and is just being used a spam  gotcha  moment. I can see the other channels taking the bait but I assumed you wouldn t which is what surprised me. in my perception of the clip  he s being extra nerdy and hamming it up and she clearly doesnt know anything about the franchise but she wants to give him shit but even as she says the  oh no  all you need is a woman like such and such  she s rolling her eyes and playing into the joke. this is clearly a duo cast member relationship  of which they were both having fun  and she was playing the feminist roll to give him shit. go back and rewatch! youre removing the clip of all of its subtext. once again - dont know him. dont know her. I just call it like I see it.its excruciatingly difficult to go on these press junkets for 24 hours straight to 10 different press programs non-stop and say everything perfect. its grueling! she s also expected to make it entertaining and since she knows nothing about the series she s faced with trying to make a joke or just sit there silent and nod along for 3 minutes.
everything that comes out of zoe kravitz mouth when interviewed for stuff regarding the movie makes me not want to watch it. in a previous interview she said something along the lines of not wanting to be eye candy for men  but continues to play one of the sexiest batman villians ever. idiot walking I guess. now she complains about tifa and aerith... do I have to take her seriously
has she never played an mmo  women generally play healers by choice
lol women also tend to take jobs that nurture and heal like nurses lol
when you ve been baptised in the religion of wokeism  everything is viewed as a problem.
the only reason I know this woman is cause of a man .. her father. she will never attain the status aerith has.
zoe is one of the worst catwoman cast choices ever.
that interview is what turns me off from watching the batman movie.. wish they remove zoe from that interview..
ay I know this sounds really petty but I kinda dont like her anymore haha
zoe kravitz only relevant due to who her father is and nepotism. she should shut up and be thankful she gets any work.
zoe is idiotic  ff7 is blockbuster and could be a big hollywood franchise
I already wasn t interested in this movie because it feels like batman has been rebooted a thousand times  but now Im definitely not interested. you cantell she doesnt play video games  and thats fine  but then dont comment on something that you have no knowledge of. unfortunately that has never stopped sjws before lol
she seems like the complaining and nagging kind of woman. like if her dude was to play a video game she would say  why are you playing video games thats stupid .and if her dude was to say that her going out every weekend is stupid there would be a huge problem. just a very basic modern female to be fair.
zoe is pretentious and tries too hard to be not like the other girls
literally like who fuckin asked   these actors and actresses seem to think people care about their opinions. also  the game came out like 3 years ago and they re just now getting pissed off
all I pray I hope she is barely in the movie. I dont want to see a love story. sorry.
oof this is bad but just wait till you actually watch  the batman  and listen to her harp on about how all of gotham s problems are caused due to  white privilege   I wish I was joking. she totally out of nowhere literally lectures batman on it during the film.
or does she have feelings for robert patterson and this is her lame childish jealousy and insecurity showing
as a feminist  Im opposed to women being put in the role of healers! thats why I only see male doctors lol
if she a feminist  like zoe comes off annoying.  what is her deal - men dont look at me  and then batman they use her sex appeal to sell it.. she wears sexual dresses to premieres..then goes off on feminist stuff.. like.. and aerith isn t healing cause she s a woman..God.. maybe aerith is a good caring person .who has that ability
right so problematic  says the woman who got pregnant on a batmobile on set with your co-star.smoothbrain take  galaxy brain.
hate to burst your bubble  but Im not gonna see itbecause a certain actress just wont shut the hell up about fictional  digital characters
who the fuck is zoe kravitz
you mean the same zoe kravitz thatstarred as the titular character in the unintentionally hilarious feminist power fantasy kimI  why am I not surprized...
yes how dare women become doctors and heal people  if aerith had just stayed in the kitchen and fixed a sammich for cloud.
tifa fights beter
robert sounds like a male feminist...
zoe is one of the most overrated actresses in hollywood.
ugh  women have to be healers.tifa  dosent even need a weapon to kick ass.ugh women have to be attractive. cloud  sephoroth...that dress ! and then complains about women being sexualized !woooow that double standard.
in the way elden ring isn t for me because its hard maybe some games aren t for highly sensitive women who cry unless the female characters are tlou2 abby
im bored of the over use of batman. dont dc has other super heroes besides him 2 09 oh  the cringe.
women are the most amazing creatures on the planet.  but good Lord the pettiness is just sad.
obviously a person who never played the game.
yeah  no. ms. kravitz isn t  beautiful . she isn t ugly but she s average af.
like with athletes....shut up and do your job.
ground chicken sounds gross.  tendies   nuggets
another out of touch hollywood actor talking about stuff she knows absolutely nothing about. and thats why the hollywood movie industry is dying.
didnt care for pattinson until now. anyone who loves ff7 dearly is part of the club. zoe is not part of the club so she can go hang with her snobby feminist friends.
the movie might be good  but riddler and catwoman look like sheeeeeeeeeeeeit.  zoe is insufferable to top it off.
jokes on zoe catwoman was the single worst part of the batman movie imo. the only thing I didnt like.
frits
leave it to a woke jewish person to not like the Jesus type character in a video game...lol
final fantasy ...is soooooooo over rated.
hot take here japanese ff6 north american ff3   ff7 come at me  and chrono trigger is still better than thatseries. so is super mario rpg and paper mario  paper mario thousand year door.
as they say. if they didn t have double standards they would have none.
frrst
wow  I didn t know that zoe kravitz was the daughter of lenny kravitz and lisa bonet. she s the definition of nepotism.
first
first! never played final fantasy. most pointless comment ever.
also zoe kravitz isn t beautiful. personality 2 10looks 3 10
zoe kravitz is boring and doesnt have the stature for catwoman.
so youre triggered about her opinion of a video game  well  as you conservatives are so fond of saying -  get over it ... what does it even matter what her opinion is...
she clearly isnt beautiful on the inside
