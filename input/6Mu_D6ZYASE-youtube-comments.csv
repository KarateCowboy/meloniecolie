current mainstream entertainment   lets take something we didn t create  dont understand why its good and change it to whatever we want. if you get mad  youre the problem.
him being a fan of the witcher and seeing the higher ups say they dont even like or haven t seen the resource material must ve been hard for him. I cant imagine being a fan of something  going under a contract  and then finding that youre the only fan of the source material.
this is good news for witcher fans. he sent a message that cant be ignored
whether you like the series or not  cavill is the show s biggest draw. not only for the eye candy and substantial star power he provides but also the legit nerd cred he carries as a diehard fan of the source material. the show is dead in the water without him.
when henry cavil was promoting season 1  he was excited   proud to play the role of geralt the witcher. but when he promoted season 2  he was less thrilled and was just phoning it in. he was obviously not happy and when season 2 released it was obvious why because season 2 was so far removed from the lore that it was embarrassing. notice he has not talked about season 3 whatsoever  henry is obviously not happy with how the show   the franchise is being handled by netflix and he s gone. I dont blame him.
this is good for cavill.  now he doesnt have to witness firsthand the destruction of a franchise he loves.  he was the last bastion.
henry cavill was the reason people were watching the witcher. so happy he s returning as superman.
his one and only condition to continue with the witcher was that they must tell great stories  while also honoring author andrzej sapkowskI s work. what does that tells you
he was willing to work on both projects  but  there was a shift. season 1  he was very excited about the show. season 2  he was a bit less excited and even somewhat embarrassed. season 3  he rarely spoke about the season at all.he d pull the books on set and he was called a dork for it. I found it a little odd to describe him that way. then we learned the writers mocked the source material and it all kind of clicked.if you had a choice to move on  why stay and work for people who hate you
henry stood with the fans  and the fans rewarded him for doing so by watching the show in large numbers. witcher  season 1  became something made for fans by fans  and in doing so it allowed new audience members to embrace the source material and become fans. as itslowly strayed from the source material it became obvious that the fans were no longer the focus  and they will leave.
I saw that coming the moment I read thatsome writers actively hated the source material considering henry is a big witcher fan.
well Im sure the writers and showrunners and everyone else there is happy to have the guy that loves the books and games so much to be leaving. since they hate the books and games so much and dont want to have anything to do with it  Im sure he must have annoyed them bringing up the cannon all the time.imagine how bad that working environment had to be for cavill to be leaving a character he is truly a fan of.
being a true fan to the books and hearing upon wokeism invasion  Im with cavill on this. he s the best to have ever played geralt  and will remain the best one to do so.another show franchise that ll soon tank....
I believe the main reason he left was the disservice witcher tv series was doing to the witcher universe and fans around the world. if there s anything henry cavill cares about  its his fans and favorite fictional worlds. he s a big geek like you or me  just more handsome. the superman opportunity was just good timing.
henry was the reason I watched the series dude was invested in the games the books he actually cared about the character and now he s out
true passionate fans stand on their principles and do not stand for changing the lore because of someone s giant ego.keep standing  mr. cavill
this is the good news indeed. cavill has been done so dirty by hollywood over the years. netflix made a woke witcher even with cavill fighting for changes. its nice to see him win after all the crap he s had to deal with. I hope cavill and the fans get the superman he should have been. cavill is genuinely one of the nicest actors today and is a big fan just like anyone else. he understands and appreciates the fans. hopefully he gets a lot of input with his second go superman. because seeing his passion is infectious and he has a great superman in him. the future looks bright.
when you know how badly he wanted the role  as he has stated himself multiple times  and you know how much he pushed for the show to be more lore accurate  I honestly dont believe that he would just leave the show in order to play superman again. I believe that  if the show had been everything he wanted it to be  he would have figured out a way to be able to do both. I ll probably still watch season 3 to see his last episodes as geralt  but no way Im sticking around for season 4 without henry.
I would actually say its good news for witcher fans. netflix should stop ruining this awesome world and its characters asap.
its amazing that he quit. the man has integrity. he fought for a as much as possible book accurate show  which was very doable. the writers and showrunners admitted to hating the source material.this is not only a lesson in how not to bow down and do anything just for the money. its also a lesson for people to do and work on thing they love and not not try to pervert  destroy or water down source material that they have no love or passion for. henry puts his fans and the fans of the projects he works on  first. hail to the king!
its always been that way since the beginning of history..... but when you convienently forget change destroy your history  it makes it more difficult to keep track of
the show two seasons are sucks
its not a bug its a feature
perfectly describes rings of power
@seahawkerino  wheel of time  dr who  star trek  star wars  resident evil  mcu   halo  and pixar disney...
@seahawkerino  you forgot star wars  star trek  wheel of time  mcu  late phase 3 and phase 4   doctor who etc etc.
@seahawkerino  oh I hear ya.unfortunately  its a far too common an occurrence indeed.
youre part of the problem proceeds to not list a single reason
its always been like that. the only modern thing is calling fans toxic and racissists
it turned out to be the same gynocentric crap  that you can watch in every other disney franchise today.
@erik demann  i.....what does this have to do with my comment specifically
more so the rumour the writers actively hated and ripped on the source material and games.
@monster               because we re dealing with the exact same class of ideologically driven higher ups as over at disney s  that cant write a script without using it as a tool to promote their own semi-religious belief system  even if you held a gun to their heads.if you think its a coincidence that the female characters ended up taking up more space than the witcher on his own show   essentially from the get go of season one  you very obviously haven t been paying attention to the level of social engineering western viewers are being put through at present.
cavill needs to write his own fantasy epic  he s played enough wow now that Im sure he d write a better script than 100  of the people working in hollywood today.
yeah its obvious henry cavill gave up on the project since he said in an earlier interview before the first season came out that he wants to sign on for 7 seasons of the show  he looked very very excited doing press tours for season 1. the guy got sold a bill of goods  so he ejected from the project after the bs switch-and-bait.
without cavill they should cancel the show and save themselves from embarassment
actually  it  is pretty easy to imagine.  its a staple of capitalism.  money is all that matters  not people.  if you work in any large corporation you will understand it.  you can give everything  but your passion wont matter one bit.  eventually  you have enough and move on only to repeat the experience until you have broken your body and spirit enough to be able to spend the worst days of your biological life not having to continue doing it.
agreed
dont forget disrespect the source material and think they can do way better
you forgot  and let s use it to push our personal agendas
its what women do.
rip lotr.
@dr. octogon   its always been that way since the beginning of history  hell to the fuck no!
to the show s credit though  it follows the books more which is closer to its source material. the problem there is that the books weren t very good.
yeah because who expects an adaptation to to mostly stay true to the souce material. the audience clearly wants my shitty fanfics  s
money people dont understand geek culture  which ironically loses them money
they lose and they still win. the rabbit hole goes really deep
well said!
I hate the future
@dr. octogon  not true. look at the original lotr movies. the first trilogy. the 2001-2003 films. that is why they turned out as masterpiece movies loved by all  they kept to the source material   honored it.
@pit Lord  the people are the money. thats called shareholder capitalism which is the best thing ever. what s really ruining content is stakeholder capitalism  where the  stakeholders  are a bunch of powerful investors with stupid esg and deI priorities that ruin good content. cd projekt is already caving to this and admitted as much.
@ithamar lowe  they wont. the ratings and reviews will tank but of course the creative team will blame  those damn racist  misogynistic  homophobic  transphobic  fatphobic  toxic fans.
@videotzar19  I know  they have to proceed to ruin things.  no matter what
they lied to him
have you actually read the books though   there is a reason that is the only publish work of that author.  I personnel thought the books themselves where crap compared to other fantasy works I have read over the years. I chalked it up as it was written in another language and maybe didn t translate well.
imagine him talk about how they were killing the series like mark hamill
and yet ignore it they will.
no he didn t I dont see how what you are saying is going to change anything  if it was going to we would still have henry cavill and netflix would care  but they got liam hemsworth so they obviously ignored it  and dont give a fuck.
@demonpride1975  but more people that were defending this piece of  will take a second look on why fans were so critical about it. sooner netflix loses its rights to the witcher franchise the better. my hope lies in hbo s hands  maybe I ll live long enough
@demonpride1975  no  they have contractual obligations. they lost loads of subscribers and are adding a free  ad supported tier. they are feeling it. yourealise how many shows they cancel
this!
best case  it dies a death and gets a better adaptation in a few years. cavill returning to play vesemir
its astounding to me that netflix and the writers think people are watching the show for their vision. the series honestly hasn t been that great up to this point aside from henry cavill s performance and the entertaining monster of the week episodes. people aren t watching because they love lauren hissritch. no  most people are watching it because the witcher 3 was one of the best video games of the last decade  and henry cavill is a great leading man and a perfect casting choice for geralt.
meanwhile  hemsworth is going to have whatever nerd cred he has dinged up something awful.
I agree.
@colten53  netflix are run by people who simply came up with a better way to deliver movies. they should never have been in charge of making them  or that much money.thats why subscription models suck. they reward companies and exploit people.
yep Im worried season 3 will be bad. it is 1.5 months away and we ve seen nothing for it.
@arcosian cosine  the fact if you notice when season 1 henry was promoting everywhere and season 2 he barely did and now he ain  t even promote season 3 and if he did he probably post one or two thing
when I saw their casting choices  I realized that this was just going to be a shitshow
@rambleon07  well yennifer is drop dead gorgeous and she was awesome in s1.cavill didnt promote s2 that I recall.  nor has said anything about s3.
@no representation  yeah  regardless of s2 s writing going off the rails  yennefer s casting is absolutely on point and freya allen really got it together in s2 compared to s1. shame henry is leaving. if the witers producers cant be arsed to respect the material while their lead role is one of its biggest fans  I cant blame him. Im living vicariously through him telling those hacks to get bent.
@reeven  yeah cirI was flushed out much better in s2.  which was good as it was the focal point of s2.but I felt they forgot about yennifer.  if she had not been in s2 what would be different   nothing.she and geralt got like 1 scene or something.  they built up this sexual chemistry on s1  and it just vanished.they could have easily had her get away  that was the worse written get away ever  in the premier episode and found geralt at witcher traning castle in episode 2.  I was really hoping to get a whole season of the 3 main together.  but we got nothing.
how they treated eskel pissed me off.
@tyrant_Gods  fact I knew once they kill him off I knew that why henry didn t promote the show that much and since he ain t post nothing about season 3 it got worst
I  agree. no reason to watch it if he leaves.
facts
why  he s a fake geek and his superman is terrible.
@john gonzalez  l take
@john gonzalez
@john gonzalez  your take is so bad on so many levels that I dont even know how to explain that to you...
@marb  you know its true. henry cavil wont save warner s failed dc cinematic universe.
so y all weren t watching because you like the witcher but rather for just an actor
@lilmario0  liking the witcher is a very good reason not to watch this series.
@judicator  the show is suck  boring  unenjoyable  bad writing  bad story telling  bad casting.
@arcosian cosine  season 3 wont come out until 2023. there s nothing for this year.
@rambleon07  yep. yennefer and triss  an indian woman a jewish gypsy and black fringilla for polish folklore !they had to walk back their non white cirI casting call too. riding
@no representation  I disagree  for me she doesnt do it as yennefer  and about for me she aint that pretty  hell I dont like her looks.
@nerviniex  s1 was all about yennifer.  it was her origin story.  s1 was more about yennifer than any other character.  even geralt.  we discover much more about yennifer than geralt in s1.  if she failed as yennifer  the show would not have garnered over 70 million views in a week nor would she have wonthe new star award.she blew my mind as hunchback yennifer.  she blew my mind as hottie of any century.  if she doesmt do it for you then you aint a man or a woman.  as every man ans woman I showed this to fell for her the instant that door opens to reveal teansformed yennifer.
@no representation  cry is free
@nerviniex  youre the one crying the show isnt up to your standards because it has beautiful woman playing yennifer who is nowhere near as hot in the games.
@no representation  u might wanna start a business with all that cry! so u are a saying that even a video game character is way more suited and beautiful than the netflix one
Im glad he quit  now Im definitely not going to watch season 4.
@lilmario0  the witcher netflix show is a embarrassment. doesnt respect the lore.
@bernard knoll  yeah I like the joker too bud
nope   I started watching it because of the games    only managed a couple of episodes....
@john gonzalez  worst take in a minute
@chris cunningham  I watched because of the games  but henry made this poop show good. just like rings of power  you cant just slap a name on it from a universe and it turns to gold  takes work  good writing and good action. with also good actors. people who read the books hate it  I just played the game.
@john gonzalez  agreed   I really enjoyed  man of steel ....
@bobby thorton  cry about it
@john gonzalez  l
@bobby thorton  come up with a more original response. Im seeing nothing but clown emojis and  l s. dorks lmao
and too bad for witcher fans.
@john gonzalez  the joker has nothing to do with any of this.
@gabeseditz  went right over your head  didnt it
@john gonzalez  maybe because you didn t explain anything  how does joke ruin the lore of anything  its a self-contained story.
@john gonzalez  clown
@gabeseditz  yeah you definitely didn t catch it. I wasn t refering to the movie itself. I was playing dumb towards all of the overused clown emojis. its not that deep
@gabeseditz  nah Im not mad. I just love seeing his simps get all pissy because I criticized an actor.
@john gonzalez  I dont think its fair to call him a  fake geek  and say his superman was bad. he was never given a proper chance by the studio and was abandoned after only three films.edit  and all three of those films were criticized because the writers took a direction with superman that most people didn t like. that wasn t henry s fault.
@gabeseditz  he is a fake geek. he doesnt care about the fans. its just another job for him. anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional. who describes playing superman as having sex  or who s first superman book is red son   thats pretty telling for a so called geek. cavil had three movies. he cant convey the character without coming off as emo and cocky. it wasn t just the terrible writing of those movies. cavil s range sucks for the character. getting him back is not a  win  for the fans like how some of these channels love to claim. they just validated the terrible foundation of the dceu by bringing the actor back instead of starting over.and dont counter with  zack s vision  or  his superman is learning . this demonstrates fundamental flaw in people s understanding in the character.
@john gonzalez  if you want to watch crap writing and b actors go for it. season 2 lost fans  numbers dont lie.
@bobby thorton  was that meant for me  cause Im not talking about the witcher
@john gonzalez  I disagree with what you just said  but whatever. think the way you want to think. also Ive never heard him describe playing superman that way  what the hell
@john gonzalez  henry is a great superman  idk who could replace him. no actor that looks just like superman like him that does a good job acting.
@john gonzalez  you do realize wb have been fucking him over since he became superman because people actually like him  he s also one of us a gamer just living his dream who actually know these characters that he is playing.
not going to lie I have a man crush on henry cavill  he played geralt perfectly. the minute you swap an actor because the original wanted continuity  is the minute I say yep fuck this show.
@juan lopez  he s not wrong.  but its not cavill s fault.  he can only do what a director and script tell him to.
@lilmario0  most women do not care about the source material.
I read the books and played the games  I have zero interest in the netflix show. even less now that henry cavill is gone.
you mean there s more of a reason to watch it now
you are not wrong I guess Im done with the witcher
true  I skipped almost all of the scenes  so I could watch henry cavil.
@john gonzalez  lol the dude isn t a fake geek but his superman was terrible under zack
henry cavill sucks as superman
@john gonzalez  did you ever stop to think your taste is just bad
I was hoping that he was going to defect to the mcu.
true.I was falling asleep at the other scenes...thinking  when is it gonna go back to the witcher  . it was a chore.there is no reason for me to watch season 4  especially .
@donald dow  thats funny. I can say the same thing to everyone frothing at the mouth for cavill superman lol
john gonzalez  he s earning more than you ll ever make in your life and has more people respecting him and his work than you. its okay to dislike his show but let s not pretend you are more successful than him or dc when you dont even make your bed this morning and still living in your dad s basement.
@e-satan  thats called projection. the guy plays pretend for a living. thats not really a valuable job. I never mocked the guy for being successful. why is that the go to argument for fanboys when their idol is criticized
@john gonzalez  lol you probably liked the eternals
@cmdr lostjayhawk  lol you wish. believe it or not  not everyone who criticizes the dceu is an mcu stan.
@john gonzalez thats not true but I guess thats what kids would say on youtube on their free time.
@e-satan  says the kid resorting to  parent s basement  deflections lmao
@john gonzalez  I would say henry s supermam has been horrible in the past due to bad writing. cant exactly do a memorable or proper performance when the writers had their hands down their pants.
@pegabis  but somehow I doubt that he can convey thatsuperman energy that others before him have. I doubt a change in script and writers will fix that. Imean  even that black adam scene came off real villainous for superman.
@john gonzalez  says the kid who claimed  projections  when being defensive
@john gonzalez  btc wtf
@e-satan  lol ok bud
man he played that part so good.. on glad he ll be in s.3 but beyond that I dont think I ll be watching
@john gonzalez  says the kid who uses  lol ok bud  as deflections
@lilmario0  I watched season 1 because of the witcher  stayed for the cavill.  Ive seen lots of interviews where he totally geeks out over projects and the other actors have no interest in the source materials.
he was the only reason I even gave it a chance  but I knew it wasn t going to last long
@grunttamer  ohok. honestly I didn t know he liked itso much.... his passion for it is what kept y all there. make sense if your a big fan of the game. so yeah understood.
@john gonzalez  let me guess u think he s a fake geek because he s an actor and rich.
@john gonzalez  how is the dc can cinematic universe failed they have been doing better than marvel for almost 2 years now
@john gonzalez  clearly ur getting off on hating on henry cavill and making weird shit up.
@lilmario0  yes  the games and the even the books are far superior to the show. no reason to watch it otherwise.
@john gonzalez .
@lilmario0  did u watch it
@cobra  agreed
@john gonzalez  alright  but you gotta get over it.
@dav wes
@john gonzalez  dude. he s not.
true  goodbye witcher  welcome back superman
wait they called him a dork  who is why and where s that proof I really want to see it
the show was much removed from the source to start with. it diverged from the start.
@daniel smith  even so  it was still good despite its odd structure. the season finale and season 2 went too far  at least for me. I watched the entirety of season 1 but I haven t convinced myself to watch all of season 2. I think Ive only seen two episodes. if they would let go of their  the writers  director  producers  etc  diversity quota crap and give up on the attempt to inject ideology into great stories and just use the source material as the basis of their stories the show would be way more popular and would be one of the most beloved franchises ever made. I dont think they will just make a good story. instead  they will fill the show with sjw perspectives and self-insert characters  and remove good story structure and character development. if they do good stories I will be happily surprised. but I dont see that happening.
@jchinckley  what s funny is the way humans treat geralt  and other witchers  and the elves and dwarves  was the exact analogy the source material used for the bigotry that every production company wants to fight with their shitstories driven down our throats. I dont get why they dont see that and they ham fist everything.
exactly... I was so disappointed when they killed eskel like that. like they straight up disrespected the guy. why why would you change the story like that and it was a trainwreck afterwards
its like... a normal job. poor diddums
@bruce  um  yeah  duh. its pretty soul crushing when you think you landed your dream job yet it turns out to be shitty people youre working with.he s an honest and open fan. what s your problem with saying it is pitiable for a fan to end up working with people that hate the sources
@bruce  no.
yes..they will ruin it by  reimagining the witcher universe
lol  micha   ebrowskI was far superior
cavil was the best person to portray the video game version of geralt  but Im glad he left because he was the only reason to even bother with the netflix show to begin with.
henry cavill literally walked out of the video game. the hemsworths should give up on acting though. it doesnt suit them
@ithamar lowe  chris is a damn good actor  liam on the other hand not at all
liam hemsworth what joe popiscopo wasnt available lol
it was already tanking when season 2 had less views than season 1.
@alwaystryin  I swear has nobody read the books  they did that already with season 2!
I actually feel bad for liam cause he is getting onto a sinking ship and I am sure he is aware of  how devoted fans were to cavill playing geralt. its so unfortunate that cavill was psyched to have a dream come true to play geralt and for things to be as true to the source material as possible  only to find out he was the only one who cared about that aspect. the only thing the studios knew about the witcher is that it is very popular and wanted to cash in on it.
@urim tummim  he was great  but film was absolute disaster.
@kat  one might say it was better than netflix adaptation
@urim tummim  you might be right  I dont know. I dont have netflix as they keep pushing their agenda by being as far from facts or source material as possible  i.e. the crown  witcher . and I left the cinema in the middle of wiedzmin  I just couldn t stand it. books are genius  what they do with them on screen not so much. but maybe I will give the film another chance  -
@kat  same treatment as with the rings of power. great lore but modern agenda is way more important than good storytelling
it tanked in season 1 dude. I cringe everytime I think about rewatching it
two words. enola holmes.
the buff geek
the legendary super geek
I agree  he himself said he will not continue with the show if netflix disrespected the original material
how come it took him so long to realise  they race swapped half the cast before the show even begun. surely  he was aware of their casting choices and still continued to make 2 seasons
@mr mann  the story was not too far off season 1 then they went crazy into the strong woke  wahman
@mr mann    he probably had a 3 season contract that he couldn t break once he saw how bad they were doing with this property.  Im just surprised they didn t cancel the show rather than recast then have to cancel anyway.
he also loves being superman  so I am glad he s back in red and blue.
@njmfff  yeah
my exact thoughts  as someone who openly says henry cavill is the only truly enjoyable element of the show  even if jaskier s moments can be quite funny. sorry  not sorry!
Im a huge witcher fan and I loved seasons 1 and 2  I haven t seen 3 yet . the criticism of season 2  frankly  felt ridiculous and fanboys hating just to hate because nothing would ever be good enough for their overbearing expectations.
they have not ruin witcher at all and liam is a big fan of the witcher as well
why would it be great news  that means that liam will take over and netflix still wont give a shit.
@dont worry  well I think the dryads of brooklyn destroyed a lot  I really do. Im glad I didn t have to see them in season 2 and season 1 would have immensly better without them. I never want to see them again.
@dont worry  read the books then you ll get it.
this! 1000  this!
no offence to chris hemsworth.  well  considering its liam and not chris he might be a little offended lol
I have played all the witcher games and read the books after that. I watched the witcher series and I could see from the very 1st season that they were neither true nor honest with the books or even the games. I am glad henry cavil left  he is a true witcher fan....the people at cdpr who worked on the witcher game could have done a far better job than the showrunners of the witcher series if they were given the chance. they did a great work on the games. when I read the books  I always imagined the characters from the games  thats the impression they left. even now when I think of the characters  characters from the games pop up in mind specially from the witcher 3 game .
cavill is a legend. nuff said. getting out with class and navigating the woke entertainment culture like the white wolf.
henry just cares about his reputation in the industry  he does not want his name to be associated with this netflix crap. very good decision  I understand him completely
I dont blame him. he was the only one who cared about the ip on production. he is probably embarrassed by his own work.
I think what scares me is  reimagining  because thatspells woke-washed  as you call it. if they only said  modernizing  and were more general about it  I d lean toward tech updates only.
I get the feeling modern reimagining just means  we are going the way of the show. it must be hard for a geek like cavill to work on projects that he knows the people writing it dont care about the source material. I saw an interview of his this week were you could tell he was disappointed in rings of power although he kept it cool  but then said how much he loved house of the dragon. I get the feeling he real wants to focus on superman and give the fans a superman we can all look up to... up up and away!
henry cavil  like atlas was holding up the heavens  was the one who kept the show going. there s no geralt without him  however we finally got him back as superman.
I was reading an interview by the producers  and one thing I remember is them using the word  representation  for season 3 after the alphabet people complaining there weren t any alphabet relationships in the series. sounds like the usual representation checklist that every new and movie goes through.
henry cavill is someone we have to root for whenever he makes decisions like this. stand up for the people who stand up for the us. wonderful actor who has really brought to life many of his iconic characters two being the witcher and superman. best supe ive ever seen and I already cant imagine the witcher being played by someone else.
man he was the only thing good about the witcher netflix series.
its nice that they give us heads up before they destroy our favorite franchises.  modern reimagining and made for a modern audience is code for stay away.
henry heard what the others that worked there said and think about the source material and left. a great man with a great decision! he stays true to himself and what he likes. I think he is the perfect geralt  but not in this show. if someone might produce a very good witcher show he will be just perfect in every way and this role might be remembered like aragorn or gandalf..
its gotta be hard being the only actual fan of something that you are part of. season 1 had its high points buy by season 2 it was obvious how they just wanted to the show to be about yennifer and  girl power . Imean  the amount of time they spent focusing on characters mourning and crying over yennifer as if she was some sort of perfect deity was pretty bad. geralt became a secondary character in his own series.
henry cavil played the perfect geralt  absolutely perfect and I loved the show because of him. he also plays the perfect superman. he should do both.what I really want to see him play in  is aegon the conqueror spin off series of got.I first noticed henry cavil in the movie immortals  which was my favorite movie he s played in so far  and ever since then  this guy is gold. whatever he plays  he will  be great in
im more surprised there are 3 seasons of this show than henry cavill leaving....
that was the most civil exchange I have ever heard between two actors.... good luck to both of them.
I remember being super excited for the show when it first came out  I love the witcher games.  I lasted half of the first episode before turning it off in disgust  the writing was horrible.  it was clear as day the writing producing staff considered geralt in the video games  toxic  or  problematic  so they made him a bumbling idiot that was always getting put in his place by all the strong independent female characters.  that literally goes against his entire character   hes clever  a badass  and a womanizer similar to conan. yes he will occasionally get tricked and what not in the games but they do so in a believable and interesting way   triss and yen were so likeable in the games  I hated them in the tv show.  they felt like completely different characters.  I could just tell in the very first episode the writing creative staff weren t fans or hated the games and wanted to change the characters for a  modern  time.  similar to the halo show  I felt nothing for this show.  its an imposter wearing a skin suit of a friend we once knew.
easily was the best part of the show  I d say his performance was the reason I enjoyed the show despite its problems.
Im still processing this personally.  I wish they had just cancelled it post-season 3.  recasting your main character may be possible in some contexts  but when your entire show hinges on that actor s passion for the role you cant.
@brandon williams  the problem is not him but the writers
netflix doesnt need to ruin the franchise anymore. its own developers are going to do that with their reboot.
I caught that too
from both seasons only episode 1 from season 2 is honest to the books
what netflix crap  the witcher is one of the best series out there right now. get woke or get clowned.
@elden wolf Lord  why s it a woke issue
@yuren chen  woke means to wake up. I dont care how anyone else tries to manipulate the english language.
@elden wolf Lord  its one of the worst tv show out there right now. I can give you atleast 10 to 15 tv shows that are far more superior in quality than this trash
@   kobaye     there aren t 10 to 15 quality shows at any given time throughout history. your standards must be low.
@elden wolf Lord  lmaooo  your standards must be very very low to think the witcher is one of the greatest tv shows ever
@   kobaye     if there are 1000 tv shows available and if the witcher is in my top 50 thatstill consitutes one of the best tv series out there. glad I could wake your simple mind to true logic
like season 1 had only a few episodes that were about him. the multI 45 episodes solely about yennefer were agonizing to get through. if he wasn t for cavil and yennefers boobs I wouldn t have even finished season 1.
@the lone space marine  yeah honestly the characterization of strong women having to be men haters and recklessly indignant is so old Im tired of hear seeing it. baffles me how this has been a problem for so long but people wont accept they are being as ignorant as the people they supposedly hate.
its good. they ll destroy themselves like rings of power  or she-hulk
updating  might also have been a decent term. with an annex that  graphical engines have made some significant advances since the initial release. and what was acceptable then would be scorned by audiences now   or words to that effect.to further bolster the point you were making.still  Im on the sceptical side for now considering their word choice.they should be well aware of how fandoms react to that dreaded sentence.so they re going to have to prove me wrong on this  before I ll consider it.
let them  we ll just not watch it. I couldn t even get though season 2 already. just obviously written to focus on anyone  women in particular  except geralt. felt more like adventures of jennefer  with geralt as side character.
@snakedogman  lmao!  did you even watch season 2  yennifer took a hige backseat in season 2 compared to season 1. sirI and geralt were the stars of season 2 and it was 10 times better than season 1 was.
@ruI silva  they dont write her name down on paper. so I will spell however the f I want.
@elden wolf Lord  ba ba ba ba baaa
@elden wolf Lord  its ok to say you weren t educated and your spelling isn t the best shill
Im not even going to bother with season 3.its over now as far as Im concerned. henry has already been paid  so its not like its going effect him.buh bye netflix travesty.
henry cavill is geralt of rivia. it was the only reason I watched.
he doesnt come close to playing the perfect superman. that isn t his fault though  he s doing the best he can with snyder s bastardised version.
the show had high viewership thanks to thats right henry cavill and joey batey as well because their dynamic as geralt and jaskier was that good. but mostly because henry cavill tho. thats how the show lasted 3 seasons I dont think jaskier alone can save this show
its just bs  right  the social game people play
liam is not going to have any fan support in this role
I will reserve judgement for now. it is easy to be overly cynical in a world of rings of power etc  etc. however  it was certainly refreshing to see two guys pay appropriate reverence to a role  so I think giving them the benefit of the doubt is only fair.
@deeppiledreams  the respect they show for each other is nice but doesnt change the fact that nobody wants the change and probably nobody will watch it.
@edgar roman  yeah you could well be correct there.
@bruce  no clue but its still civil and professional.
even if the new actor is a fan and respects the material  the show unfortunately wont improve if the director and writers are in the way of not respecting the source material.
@beefnoodles95  true that  just for clarity my comment was not addressing the quality of the show but the quality of their discourse.
@bruce  yes its all the usual bs and boot licking but its at least civil and nobody is getting racisismed so itsounds strange nowadays.
@beefnoodles95  note that everyone in the show claims to be a fan for the press. even the marvel dc comic writers thatsuck claim to be comic book fans. afaik one of the only brave and stunning that admitted she was not into comics is the she hulk main writer showrunner jessica gao
controversy isn t really cavill s style
@marco genovesi  you said  racismed  so now I am surprised they didn t replace geralt with a black actor.
@marI rowen  geralt is a secondary character in the show so its ok. the main characters are the sorceresses anyway
I know the author of the books andrzej sapkowskI wasn t happy with the deal he made with cdprojeck red since the success of the games was a win for the game developers  but one has to wonder if a better financial deal with netflix was worth the deviation from the source material. apparently it didn t sit well with cavill
well said
I hope liam can faithfully carry the torch but with the allegations about the writers room  Im doubtful that liam will have a fair shot at geralt
I only watched for his geralt. some others were good but he carried thatshow on his back with his performance. I gotta say Im looking forward to him as supes again.
I can certainly sympathize with followers of the witcher but at the same time I can understand why cavill has walked away from netflix.
henry did such a great job! its sad to see him leaving the witcher series. anyway good luck with superman! at least perhaps thats a sign that this superman will be actually good
100  agree with ur take. I tried to watch it  got bored a few episodes in. henry cavill was by far the best part. this is gonna tank so hard.
well  Im not surprised. sure  he was cast as one of his favorite characters  but in the end  it was like he was playing his favorite character in a very very badly written tumblr fanfic....soedit him quitting this will save me a lot of time  since I only planned on watching the next season because of henry. I was only sticking to it because he was such a good actor and overall great person. his geralt voice was....perfection!
watching melonie struggle with names is so adorable. and I swear  itseems like seems like she s bored with every live action show lately. since its sunday....go steelers!
this doesnt surprise me cavill is a big fan of the books and games and there have been rumors that he wasn t happy with all the changes the show was making to the storyline also I imagine he was tired carrying the whole show on his back
well he deserves better and we get him back as superman
henry was the link that attached me to the series. now that thats broken  I dont see myself sitting through this series anymore. my joy for his return as superman trumps his exit from witcher any day.
geralt is such a difficult character to pull off correctly  the personality is so nuanced  I really cant see anyone else pulling this off like cavill did.
the show was a slap in the face of fans of the books and video games.  totally dont blame him for leaving.
to be honest  Im a fan of the games  haven t read any of the books  yet  though Ive dived into some pieces of lore out of interest looking around or through the games journals and have a basic picture of what happened  what should be going on and how things should eventually play out. season 1 although being confusing with the timeline  because of the nature of the book they were adapting being a collection of small stories  and bad editing having all stories past and present cut cross together  and some bad concept designs  nilfgaardian soldiers   felt like the witcher and got me excited for season 2. well  that was until that came out. apart from the first episode  which was part from the book they adapted for s1 and was cut for the later season  although they improved on having more witcher inspired music and better designs in some parts as mentioned before  they fucked up sooo hard with the story and characters I really didn t want to watch any more of it. I thought thatseason 2 was sooo incredibly bad that a season 3 never came to my thought that would be happening.
henry s press release about leaving the show was very entertaining. how many orchestrated rewrites did they go through before publishing it basically he left cause it was and is woke garbage  the end! lol  I cant remember where I left off after finishing the first season of witcher. like most others  I kept dozing off and not even caring about what Imissed. if I remember correctly  it became all about serI and yennifer. on the topic of remake of first witcher game.I think this will be an amazing success especially when cdpr decided to farm out the project to another company. how could it fail  look how well it worked for rockstar when they farmed out their most important games ever to a wet behind the ears developer to update! it was a masterpiece of a cautionary tale to all devs on what happens when yourelease a poorly made product. what s also sad is is someone from crockstar had to ok those sh!t remakes!given our current situation with all the blatant attempts to screw us the consumers by big corporations  I dont put stock into anything these guys say!let s just say  I ll believe it when I see it! cdpr is another empty vessel who makes decisions base on graphs and charts via the board of directors who likely will never see much less play the end product they dump on us .the rockstar way!
he was to good for this show
whenever I hear the quote  reimagining for the modern audience  I immediately check out. we know what thats coded.
it kills me that henry cavill wont be geralt going forward.  he embodied the character so well and you knew he took itseriously!
nothing is better than something bad  this piece of knowledge saved my marriage and ressurected my grand parents
never got into the show but it wouldn t have lasted the 2 episodes I watched without him.
what s funny is that the first episode of season two happened in the prequel book before geralt was even aware of cirI s existence.
if he s as... level-headed as his older brother  the character of geralt stands a shot at being accurately portrayed  as cavill s rendition was.
a fan of the witcher wouldn t like the netflix show anyway. its not accurate to the novel or the game. its just its own weird americanized woke crap.
@max master j  imagine how much worse it would have been without cavill. he was the only one who was actually a fan of the source material and would push to make certain things more fiathful.
as a fan of the witcher books and games Im so Goddamn happy this has happened netflix deserves to burn after season 2.
season 1 was pretty close to the source material even though the casting wanted to spread  the message  and be  diverse .but I didn t care about it and enjoyed season 1 because I knew the first 2 books.but season 2 was a total mess with so many changes and making yeneffer the villain it just sucked.I really didn t like it and didn t have much more hope for season 3 anymore. seems like henry shared the same thoughts.
netflix said they were gonna pursue success  not wokeness. does the ceo need to be replaced    does freakin blockbuster need to come back ! !
I dont sympathize with fans of the show they got what they paid for. they were happy with the nonsense fed to them in s1 which allowed all of this destruction to happen.
season 2 already did worse than season 1 in viewership. they managed to piss off both book and game fans by killing off eskel  before even the rest of that dogshit rewrite season came out.

sad to see cavill go. but hey we get him as supperman. yes!  great to see you  love ya melonie. another great video.
cavill could have handled doing superman and the witcher at the same time. Imean he isn t even in over half of the show anyways. more than likely he left because he was tired of the writers and show runners butchering the source material. in season 2  one of the writers had written geralt s reaction to joke about the death of his horse  roach. cavill didn t like that and instead delivered a speech directly lifted from the books. thats something that actual writers who appreciate the source material could have easily done. it is cool that cavill was enough of a fan to do this scene appropriately  but as the actor  itshouldn t be his job to hold the writers to deliver a show that fans want.
interesting  your reaction is basically on point with how I felt about this series.
I get the fears of  modern reimagining  but it could also mean its being given a new coat of paint with modern graphics rather than trying rewrite the story and characters. I wouldn t worry too much until we see more and get more info
this really sets the tone for s3  so sad news... if the writing is even worse than s1-s2  then Im good with his decision
always knew this would happen. when the show barely started. the first signs was changing the characters.
well that pretty much guarantees I wont watch another episode.
if I remember correctly from past interviews  all the hemsworth brothers are pretty big video game nerds so I believe liam when he says he s a fan. I think he ll do just fine and Im looking forward to his take on the character. sucks that henry is leaving but he s got bigger opportunities.
for me as for a fan of the witcher books and games  watching a second season of tv series was so painful I swear to God I will not watch a third one. when I imagine what kind of torture it was for henry to play in thatshitfest  Imust say I totaly understand his decision.
I wish hemsworth the best. he seems like a good fit and Ive learned not to write off an actor for a role
good thing henry got out of the sinking ship before it capsized
Imean we all saw this coming as soon as it was announced who was working on the show and they opened their damn mouth spouting out a bunch of nonsense. cavil was the only one keeping it all together and I hope it tanks hard.
maybe they can cgI cavill s upper lip on liam.   problem solved...
I watched some of season one when I had netflix  but was kind of lost knowing nothing of the source material. I thought it was interesting and the monsters were cool  but I didn t really understand the world. maybe because they didn t explain it to me because the production team sucks so bad.
once I hear those words  I tap out. if everyone  who s opinion I value  says its good I ll try it out. already beat the og a long time ago
thanks henry you were the show and like you its time to go .
I have to agree with you. he made it watchable. he was pretty good but there was some parts where you get bored fast with some of the side characters
at least its good to know we can stop watching at season 3  not for the actor change but because I hate when producers hate a product yet want to make money off itso they change everything about it for people that aren t even fans. its good to see that both actors are being good sports about it and very supporting of each other.
actually very sad about this. henry cavill was the perfect live-action geralt. he took his role very seriously and loved it until he found out the writers are hacks who hate the witcher source material and ruined the show. not going to watch any more seasons on netflix. they messed up big time by hiring terrible writers and show runners.
the fuq  krewsade! no cavill  no coin! what is actually left worth watching on netflix anymore  I can almost see your point on the first season  but as it progresses and the different threads make more connections  it really picks up steam and draws you in to the characters culminating in an awesome payoff cliffhanger in the final episode. it feels kind of similar to the first season of  the expanse  in that way. it may be hard to slog through the setup  but the payoff is worth it. side note  I also wonder what your opinion of the battlestar galactica reboot is
good old supperman. he can cook turkeys in a single bound!
I hope they keep the original theme from supperman. if there isn t frantic playing of the triangle  I ll riot.
season 3 already done and of course cavil is in it.
it was so boring anyway. basically no fun in it
@ iga zdovc  and no matter how great that might be  what I know will follow is going to be worse than the worst of the first 3 seasons. liam hemsworth hasn t managed to convince me to care about a single character he s ever played. best of luck to him  and maybe my pessimism will be proven unfounded. but that d basically be like quantum physics making my motorcycle levitate. technically possible...but definitely not gonna happen.
too bad the show only had 3 seasons... I sure wish it had more.cant wait for season 3. I look forward to the show s finale.
I do wonder if part of his reason for leaving is the time taken out for other roles. stepping back into superman is a big role. I also think he has to be in the running for the next james bond  and if so who knows what stage those talks are at. if he became bond that probably wouldn t allow time for the witcher.
its not liam that has me worried  its that henry was willing to leave it behind. I dont buy for a minute that you couldn t schedule around both of those roles  which tells me he s lost faith in the project  full stop. henry must know his leaving kills the show  and as a fan I dont see him wanting to kill off something based on a story he clearly loves. maybe in the future he could figure out something for a aaa film where he has more control. that would be something to see.
the name power of people isn t what draws the audiences anymore  not when the project is an established ip. first two seasons were pretty cool  wish them luck on their take on the witcher.  no doubt their watch numbers will take a hit.
Imean it makes sense  itseems like in season 2 they were trying to make him a side character in preferring woke characters.
did that 3 episodes into season 1...good for you  mr. cavill.
also remember that henry cavill had his agent contact the producers before there was even a showrunner. and when they began auditions  henry wasn t included! only after no one was selected did they turn to henry cavill.
the only reason I was watching the show. thatsaid  the audience cheered and clapped when henry showed up in adam!
well to be fair when henry cavil  who I knew little about was cast to be geralt of rivia. I was not sure about him  I had only played the video games. so what I knew of the character  just to me didn t relate to henry cavil. and boy was I wrong  he spectacularly took the role and made it his own. so Im going to sit back and see what chris hemsworth does  give him a chance as I did with henry. and if it does not work out  then I have a couple of seasons left with henry as geralt. then I can simply move on to something else  few things to catch up with. net runners series from cyberpunk 2077  and arcane from riot studios ip league of legends. but it does seem odd for a super nerd and fan boy  and I say that in the most positive  loving and respectful way. that he s turning away from something so beloved. I did notice in season one of the witcher  there were some leaning s towards the woke movement. but they were very subtle and didn t intrude very much  to the overall enjoyment. however I have not seen past that first season  so I wonder if with most viruses. its becoming an outbreak  and henry is like  nope  Im getting out of dodge. but then the dc universe is rife with the virus being a virtual pandemic  so maybe it is a money thing perhaps. but with henry itseems unlikely  so I dont know.
henry is a guy I d play 40k with.dude is awesome
beau warned us  the writers hate the material source. they want to make their own stories and shit on what made it good.
the potrayal of eskel in season 2 was probably one of the reasons he decided to leave.
gurentee that the writing staff   producers cheered when he quit. he was the only one holding their feet to the fire to make it right. and they ignored his ass 99  of the time.
r.i.p witcher...
now he should play commander shepard from  mass effect
lets be real  the show was called the witcher  starring everyone else but cavil
I dont blame him for quitting witcher. the way the writers and show runners treated the source material in thatshow was horrendous. there s no hope for the witcher.
my brother took the ap literature class last year. he said that they were taught not to interpret literature by studying the time period paying close atention to the author s words or reading about his her life and other work  but rather to put a certain lenses and to think what a freudian  marxist  feminist or lgbt minority member would say with the story. they basically deconstructed the story and reconstructed it in the given model. its not surprised that producers still believe they are faithful to the source material when their  adaptation for modern audience  are so far from the original.
henry wanted to be a unofficial loremaster onset and in production and he actively got shutdown by the showrunner and I daresay support staff. my heart aches for this man and a dream pissed on.
henry cavill was the only reason I watched thatshow
there are no woke characters in the witcher. or I wouldnt watch it of there were.
congratulations  you have been rewarded with a prize. send a dm to the telegram above
I dont blame him. henry cavill is one of my favorite actors and he knows respects the source material more than anyone. if he s out  so am i.
melonie   I couldn t make it past the first episode of season 1.me      watched season 1 four times....   but... I only watched season 2 once and didn t find it nearly as gripping as season 1
mads mikkelsen would be also perfect for the role
witcher crew   cmon hank let s have sone fun today! get a little action going! cavill   we must stay true to the lore Imust explore this character more deeply witcher crew   aww fer fck s sake
no one will watch it without him.  good luck with that.  he is the only reason I watched.
cavill finally told hissrich where to stick the silver sword
we keep our fingers crossed for a good  modern reimagining . also good puppies!
lol  henry watched season 3 and was like  Im done
melonie  besides tr  what s your next favorite game game franchise
I dont have an opinion on this but I would like to point out how beautiful melonie is. theres no way you cant notice but its always worth mentioning
honestly dont care who plays geralt  liam seems like a good person to do so physically wise. if he honors the source material I dont care is in the seat. yes I do want a superstar in the seat but honestly I want someone who cares about the roll. hc cared for the roll  I think he cared to the point that he wouldnt let a shit take over.
man getting the lead actor replaced sucks  Ive been playing bayonetta this weekend and drama and concerns of va pay aside  it is still very jarring that every character sounds like how Im used to except the main character. it really just gets to the point that every time I hear her speak all I think about is that itsounds different  it takes me out of the experience.
-  shouldn t we hire people who actually like the project and wanna make it as authentic to the original vision as possible  -corporate media   and let the fans win   what are you nuts !
as a former game artist in virtuos  I know that tomb raider s next will be the remake of anniversary and my art director made lara s high poly model.
tbh I feel bad for liam  regardless of the show s quality  he s gonna get a ton of unfair hate and comparison  mostly hate  for taking a job opportunity.  really sad.
I think interviewers should start asking the cast or writers producers who claim to be fans on the project like simple questions to see if they even know the basics of that project. this will be a good heads up for the viewers.
as long as we get him back as superman im happy.
this makes me so sad honestly.
if he s leaving because he has problems with the direction and writing of the show  and the people doing those jobs  he really should stand up and say so to shine a bright light on their skullduggery.
nobody can play geralt as well as he did.
too old
aw thank you
always
please  anyone with integrity should turn it down. such that nobody will do it  so no show gets made. thats what a good society looks like
take the risk and pay the price
as a witcher fan  is this a new tactic to bringing in fans. it works so well with henry cavill they re going to start having all the actors claim their massive fans of the source material for shows like this
since the witcher has magic in it  I think the way they ll change actors is via magic  lol.  basically  a magic spell to make caville s witcher look like liam. they ll probably explain the reason it happened in the show to help ease thor s brother into the role.  its lame  but thats the only way I canthink about how to explain it to the viewers and why.  Im happy we got our superman back!
this tells me the fighting he had to do for season 3 didnt end well and he was over it. he had said he would do both superman and the wticher prior to the report that witcher writers hate the source material. this just makes me seriously concerned thatseason 3 will have even more bs in it.
without henry cavil there s no reason to watch the witcher.
if youre going to do a series based on video game lore you need addicts of the game involved in the writing. if its based on a game with multiple choices and multiple endings  you need input from players who have experienced multiple choices and endings. they went into the project thinking it was a quick money grab from a gaming audience  they didn t realize how precise they had to be with actual characters in order to retain that audience. I got as far as the first episode of season 2 and rage quit.
for modern audiences  is corpospeak for  we dont want our old audience.
hey mac sister!keep being b a s e d
only henry cavill knows how to use those swords  not liam or anyone! only henry cavill looks good in thatsuit!
this is about saving face for him.  he needed a decent reason to bow out of the show and the showrunners dropped the ball.  wouldn t be surprised if others are recast.
probably why he left is cus of the season 3 witcher script.  its gonna show how much of a fan the writers are   and when it comes out
totally agree. henry was the the prime reason was so popular cuz he got into character so well
henry cavill - respect  100!
I honestly thought this was a troll post on twitter but I predict that the witcher is going to lose views because of this.
they had their pr guys give these written statements thatsave  face  whether its between henry or liam here to the public but its just a bunch of bullshit. its easy to tell that this isn t the truth with what s  being said.fact is that henry  when  finding out that this show was being made  actively sought out this role. like he had his agent literally leave voice messages and bug the show runners repeatedly over and over and over. he is such a avid fan of the books and then the games and he loves this geralt character. he talked in interviews where this is one of those role of a lifetime type characters to play as for him.thatsaid  that only reiterates how he would not give up this role willingly. he s choosing to quit because there is a direction and desire to disrespect the source material which he is well aware of  and called them out on often. I was honestly surprised he was even going to be in a season three after seeing what they did at the beginning of season two. Imean a job to job  but seeing how he talks about the books and this universe  I kept thinking that he would show signs of being upset with the show. so whatever shit they re doing in season three and confirmation of this direction they re going in  it must ve been the straw that broke the camels back. so he s not saying it out loud and letting his pr guy do the nicely worded messages between his leaving and liam taking his role  but what he s really saying is  fuck you Im out. this is not the character that I wanted to play. so between that  and then miley cyrus s ex-boyfriend replacing him  how this show even stays alive is beyond me. literally just shows how desperate netflix is to have something because this show is dead.
I dont blame cavill for leaving  he is a fan and understands the material while the writers do not. he was the only good thing on the show!
the last time I went to cd projekt red s website to look at their esg stuff  half the pages let nowhere and itseems like they were trying to stay as far away from woke stuff with their esg language as they could. they seem to be not doing this willingly and are pushing back as much as they can in their language. I d recommend diving in and seeing if you see the same thing.
Ive not missed a video in years  but Imust admit the  go boom  channel is by far my favourite.
remember his interview where he said all he wanted was the show to be true to the source material  witcher writers dont remember.
new video yay!!!!
just makes me wonder why liam isn t in marvel already with his brother.
or rather dont explain it and act like nothing happened. it is a recast  everyone will understand. to think the audience needs explaining is to question the intelligence of the viewer.
season 1 was fine. I haven t watched season 2  but based upon this I will just stick to my plan of rewatching stargate sg1
that ll be the next taika movie  where thor s drunk brother  door  moves in.
everytime he gets a role he knows the character and actually play them good either wb or a studio fuck him over so sick it
did geralt have any lines in the last series as opposed to the occasional grunt. he was just a background character in his own show.
they took advantage and sidelined their biggest actor in the entire show
I died a little inside hearing about this
sad news but the quality of the witcher dropped hard in season 2 no wonder he left
henry worked hard to get on the project because he was a huge fan. I knew something was off with season 2 he was a lot less enthusiastic about the promotion for it there are even stories of how he tried adapting the story correctly and quoting the books and after episode 2 I just could not watch the show it was a catastrophic depiction characters in name only. I am glad he moved on to superman.
youre such an optimist.guess I better hurry up and get the original before they pull it.
the game is supposed to have an update to make an option for geralt to look like the netflix actor  so what are they gonna have 3 versions now
let s be honest. the writting was on the wall once he announced he was back as superman.
id honestly rather wait a few years for another season to have henry as geralt
but whose gonna replace the writers
after season 2 I knew it was out.  toss a coin to your witcher
its a shame. Im a fan of cavill starting because of his defense of witcher fans.
witcher was in my top 3 all time shows and henry as the main character was so perfect .why dose everything thats perfect never last!!! I guess I ll just be watching seasons 1 to 3 on repeat.
liam will fill it well  I dont think he will do as good as henry but we might be surprised.
this is good news for witcher fans
the show wasn t about the witcher in the first place so it already wasn t good.
I like that liam is apparently a huge witcher fan as well  but Im concerned that he looks more like the bard than geralt.
that he ey is back as superman and I hope zack is back to film mos 2 because mos 1 was 9.5 10
I think liam can pull the character but can he carry the series like henry  I dunno
good thing you didn t watch the ending of s2 I though in bleaching my eyes after that
you need higher standards lol
@low-key  or maybe I can appreciate a show without shitting on it because it is different then the source material. not saying that the show was perfect but it was better then most of the crap currently coming out. way better then game of thrones for sure
Im betting he saw the direction and attitude the witcher writers and showrunners wanted to take and he just had to disassociate himself before it all hit the fan.
now he can grow back out that badass mustache from mission impossible!
clarification  they never said  modern reimagining  anywhere in the official announcement  I dont know where bounding into comics got it from  they said that they re making it for the  next generation of gamers  which to me sounds like they are welcoming a new audience that probably started with the wild hunt and didn t play the first game  also the implementation of a new engine in unreal 5  it is more of a technical speak than saying they ll change the content  they ll probably remove the sex cards Im sure  but they weren t liked that much in the original too  and they ll improve the gameplay  but the main story will remain the same
im not so sure of the current team  a lot of their experienced members quit during the whole cyberpunk...still they used up a lot of goodwill too so lets hope they learned...
season 3 must be geralt on a hunger strike lmfao
this is actually good news. time for cavil to work on something worth his time for the netflix witcher to be scrapped and a new series to emerge  but this time based on the source material.
henry is all class
make no mistake  supes has nothing to do with it. no reason he cant do both. he s leaving cause the writers are straying too far from the source material. so the reality is even if he stayed it would probably still continue to get worse.
to be perfectly honestly I never cared for the netflix witcher series I couldn t get into it I only watched maybe the first 3-4 episodes then I just gave up
its fine  having a witcher in the witcher just gets in the way of the stunning and brave magic girl bosses anyway
well  there s this scene where a  knight  chops up a harmless creature for no reason. that was pretty funny  in context.
coming for our fantasy movies and shows y-y
and just like that  I have no reason to check out season 3.
no offence to chris hemsworth  ahahaha dammit thatsays it all
clipped coin covered this yesterdayish  he brought up some quote from awhile back that henry cavill promised he would stay with geralt as long as the show tried to stay true to the books and games  cause he loves those and wants to bring that love of the fans to the show. henry saw how garbage season 2 was  just finished season 3 which is probably woke garbage  and was done with the series. they already have a replacement before season3 is released.... yeah he was done with these fricks
people  remember that this isn t liam s fault. no hate towards him is justifiable.
the first season was good  but the 2nd one was heading downhill fast.  I can only imagine how bad the 3rd season must be for henry to leave.
netflix had planned for 5-7 seasons  they fronted loaded the cost into the production facilities  equipment  sets.  netflix is locked into that number of seasons. itsounds like the parting is amicable.  I hope henry cavill will offer liam hemsworth guidance. cavill seems like an honorable dedicated person. its just that he cant be geralt and superman. there just isn t enough time in his schedule.  a few years back the spartacus series lost their star to cancer. while spartacus star andrew whitfield was treating his cancer  the production shot a prequel season  before the character s arrival. unfortunately  mr. whitfield succumbed to his illness  and was replaced liam mcintyre for the third season. mr. mcintyre tried to have his portrayal consistent and loyal with and to mr. whitfield s.  also  in star trek  discovery and star trek  strange new worlds  anson mount makes a serious effort to be consistent with the late jeffrey hunter s portrayal as capt. pike.  my point is  it will suck if liam hemsworth doesnt make an effort to copy cavill s portrayal  and tries to  make his own . every time replacement actors do that  its for their ego  and it confuses the audience. the only exception is james bond  but even that has its limits.mr. hemsworth  if you are reading this  do the homework  consult henry. he s an honorable  stand up guy  and most likely will be eager to help.
I dont rightly know but as a fan  this is not bad news for me. netflix had their shot. I wish henry the very best. he was an excellent geralt of rivia in a butchered take of the northern realms. this is for eskel.
ah  liam hemsworth. better known as chris hemsworth s brother.
just in time for superman
@bruce  stash man!!! ba-ba-da-da!!
now  see if you feel the same way after watching cdpr s video about esg.
@kyler  so they ve gone full corporate  its not like we haven t seen this with cyberpunk s release but its still sad to see.
there is about 2 hours worth of  good  content in season 1  all when henry is on screen.... the other 6  hours is just waiting for more geralt stuff. season 2 was absolute garbage. it hurts my brain how anyone got together to make thatshitstain of a plot and shitfest on book characters they were tripping over to ruin
@visser matt  you know its too bad because I had high expectations for this show and I heard somewhere the creators of this show dont even like the games or the books so thank you netflix for wasting people s time and interest
@aziaxtremenfinity  yeah  its honestly strange on who ends up in charge of productions. I bet some set workers read some of the books and stuff and asked why nothing made sense  thats where rumors like that come from. leh sigh.  why make a show based on a famous book game series and ignore the source material being important during hiring
is it bad news tho  the only reason the show was getting views was thirsty women simpin for henry  not watching for the actual  adaptation  of the story. good news imo  henry got wise and left a shitty production.
well now he gets to mentor shazam and fight black adam. cant wait
he left because 1  gearing up for superman projects  2  he had a  career ending  injury while filming season 2 of the witcher and doc advised him to not do heavy stunts no more.
this just makes me so sad...
I think the remake is going to just update the graphics and the swordplay. the original is tough to play and there is a lot of backtracking for the sake of making the game take longer. that being said I dont think cdpr is going to do any woke changes. they might clear up the story a bit to make it more seamless into the witcher 2. the games didnt even feel related.
good for him
the show didn t respect the books or the games. henry is better off as superman.
Im surprised they didn t go  its 2022 let s get more diversity and make geralt a poc  btw tomb raider is awesome Ive literally played every single one.
if henry isnt geralt Im not watching the show. I personally really liked his portrayal in the show.
I would much rather him be superman than geralt.  he got a raw deal after man of steel so Im glad to see dc attempting to right the ship.
the thing I dont understand is they even had andrzej sapkowskI as consultant for the first series. I dont know if netflix also had him back for the second  third or fourth series but im guessing not since the showrunners hate everything about it and know very little if not completely nothing about the source material.  im not sure if they flew him out there to be on set or if all business was conducted over video calls but netflix still paid the man to be there or standing by to make sure things were close enough to his books.maybe netflix was trying to virtue signal and  one up  cdpr who had refused to pay sapkowskI when he sued them for more money  even after signing away the rights to his creation for a fixed lump sum of cash instead of royalties residuals like cdpr had originally offered him. it could also be because because sapkowskI s name being attached to the show added some level of authenticity which served no purpose than to fool the real fans of the franchise that if he was involved with the project then the show was going to be awesome.either way. I didnt care to carry on watching after the first series. I cantell henry cavill is superman because he was literally carrying the show on his shoulders. the show dies without him.
there is a huge chance this is going to tank without cavill.
season 1 was so good.  then they made season 2 about everyone except the main character.   Im not a witcher lore guy so I dont know what they changed I just know itsucked but whole.  I watched season 1 3 times.  season 2 I stopped watching like 4 episodes in
they literally could have just had a collection of episode of the witcher just witching and hunting stuff and people would have been fine with that.
time to update geralt for a modern audience  I bet.
good things never last for long in hollywood.
they want liam because he doesnt have power to push back and when it fails the writers will pin it on him.
modern reimagining.  the death knell.
no interest in that woke show
he didn t quit because it was a terrible show  as you said he got a better offer to be re cast as superman  to be honest though superhero movies are so watered down now its really background noise when you are working at home or playing video games. all these superhero films aren t making money because they are being watched they are making money because its something to watch when nothing else is on or something to listen to in the background.
Im not religious  but Im praying for a new henry cavill witcher show. one with writers who get it.
the tv show was mostly pretty bad with just moments of good stuff. so I think its actually good news that he s leaving...because he seems to have his heart in the right place  and I wouldn t want him to keep associating with a show thats trashing the lore. btw  no doubt time conflicts also had at least some effect on his decision....but as said  geralt is a dream role for him  meanwhile imo superman is a somewhat risky role  because a good superman movie is very hard to make. but with the witcher show heading south at a rate of knots as more and more people have had enough of woke agendas wrecking shop with established stories  I think it would ve made any decision of his much easier to make. he was doing a great job when on screen  but thatshow titled   the witcher   wasn t hardly about the witcher . hence  not really his dream role after all
Imean the guy had to choose between superman or gerarlt or rivia.   I wish he had done both though but im excited to see him back as superman!
they re out of their minds if they think anyone will watch season 4. all respect to hemsworth  henry was geralt.
good news actually for most witcher fans never watched it.I never did  because of how they slandered triss merigold.
I think cdpr s modern reimagining is only about ue5. the first game was on the aurora engine I believe.
I liked the first episodes of both seasons. it was the only time it ever felt like the witcher. but I hated most of the actors  writing and pacing for all the rest so much I just started skipping ahead in each episode to just the scenes with geralt. you get through it fast that way because he s really only in it about 15 minutes an episode for most of them. as far as the re-imagining of the games.. most of the crew who worked on the originals are gone from cdpr. they aren t going to be using the red engine. so not only is there going to be a new agenda behind the writing its not even going to play like the same franchise. least they told us the plan. that was nice of  em.
man henry cant get a break .
I am more convinced it came down to money instead of passion. it was well known that he has asked for large somes of money from dc  superman  for a long time  which is why he wasn t in shazam .
so far each season was based on the games  maybe he does not want to do a 4 because there is only 3 games
thats a shame  henry did a really good job at being geralt. the rest of his cast mates on the other hand  were not so great. especially the lady that played yenefer.
as a massive witcher fan Im good I ll stick to books and games thank mac you are awesome.
I have heard something about an older witcher tv series made in poland. would be nice to know is it any better  and even better if it were subtitled to other languages.the witcher games are on sale on online distribution platforms  at least on steam and gog.
I get the feeling a pr team wrote these exit and entrance letters.
really depends on what sort of  reimagining  they are doing for the witcher 1 game. there s some clunky dialogue that could use work  some quests that could use some touches  and some fighting mechanics could use some serious work as well as a general graphics overhaul. they stick to that and flesh out the game on those points and make it more like what was in witcher 3 and probably everybody will be more or less okay with a remake. they start injecting woke garbage and there will be issues.
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
the modern reimagining of witcher will have geralt killing monsters to pay back his student loans
replacing a main character doesnt really end well for the majority of shows.
yeaaaaaah. he s what got me to watch the show. probably be a pass for me now. its fine. just saving me money
its actually brilliant news. cant see what you talking about! cavill gets back to being an a-list actor and respected in the industry  and the witcher tv show that really the yennifer tv show can go die its slow death and take all its girl bosses with it.
I didn t because of how they race swapped and character assassinated yennefer. ironically I am the same ethnicity.
superman...
I d say jaskier was also a good cast other than henry as geralt
I think cirI was ok too and jaskier but jennifer chick  cause lets be real that isn t yennefer  isn t good or convincing.
Imight remember wrong but the polish adaptation series is here on youtube. cantry to look it up.
@molly h. johns  I found it. and could be a movie. dont know is it legit.
it is possible that by  modern reimagining  they are referring to the game mechanics which are pretty dated.  lets hope so.
he was the only thing carrying the show.
the  modern reimagining  is probably more about making tw1 more rpg  a little bit like tw3  open-world etc
good to see cavill back as ole supes in black adam. I loved him as geralt but oh well. got one more season to enjoy. hopefully it ll be a good one.
henry is such a pro  he even graceful pulls out of a franchise that he loves. the writes of the s1 2 show are not professional and destroyed the opportunity to make a block buster. the pissed it away and will never be re-employed. in another big block buster.
the witcher was a love project for henry. according to freya allan he s walking lexicon for the witcher on the set.as I heard he even bugged the producers and the writers to make the episodes more closer to its origins.hemsworth  I dont think so. I am sceptical about him to fill his shoes.as for the superman topic. I loved henry as superman. he s the closest we get for Christopher reeve. however the treatment that he was about to replaced by a more woke  more modern version and he can return just because  the rock  lobbied him makes my stomach crawl...that being said I wish him the best and the witcher show too.
Ive heard rumors he has no speaking role at all in season three. he just grumbles the entire time looking around.
give season 2 a watch dude is a bad ass. hemsworth I dont think will even cut it let alone polish the boots
thor   will woke for      fans   we know. no thanks .
modern reimagining  is the equivalent of taking teen-titans and the outcome becomes teen-titans goI hope fool designs the game with witcher 3 in reference. it might just be me  but I kind of hope they keep some of the combat in there  I actually enjoyed having the three combat styles you have to use based on what enemy you were fighting   but having the click to crit effect can go away lol
let s not confuse liam with the better brother.
despite what he looks like now  we ve always felt a nerd kinship with cavill  Im having this horrible vision of him being made light and fun of by the woke bullies who run the show and care more about agenda than story and lore and that is why he really quit. hope thats just my imagination.
let s hope they dont do what happened with mass effect. though the overall game was still really good with the release of the legendary edition. their were unnecessary changes that were made that literally contradicted the story. those that have played the game knows what Im referring too.
the puppies sure love to play. so much energy.
well Imean henry flat out stated that if they ever deviated from the source material or tried to change to much that he would quit the role.and with hollywood being what they are it was to be expected  henry kept his word they tried messing with his favorite franchise to much and he walked because he didn t want to be part of destroying it. I dont blame him I d do the same.the show will be dead in the water without him.
I think this is good  itshows that he actually cares about the witcher franchise and doesnt want to a be a part of some woke shit they want to do  I guess .
be prepared for a quick downfall... it ll never be the same
its more than just them saying a modern reimagining cd project red has said how they re going to be focusing on their esg.
disappointing cause cavill not only played the part perfectly he looked the part. well it was a good run while it lasted. they should just wait until cavill is available to do the next season rather than killing the show with hiring a different person.
dream collab team  brett cooper and melonie
watch  the writers producer director will get to liam and the battle call of a quote will be  its ma am!
cavill needs to focus on getting the warhammer 40k movies tv shows up to speed and playing garviel loken or some other awesome hero of the imperium.
even the dogs get irritated with the  modern reimagining  of our beloved stories.  good puppies  d  ...right on queue.
good on him.
I was pretty iffy on his casting  and when I first heard his voice  he sounded like a cosplayer. he ended up doing great  though. wont be any better with him gone. the writing and other casting choices sure aren t compelling enough to keep watching.
I always got the feeling that after several episodes  most fans of the witcher games or books lost interest and the remaining viewers were made up of disenfranchised khaleesI fans looking for a new female icon to follow in the form of ciri. given this possibility its easy to see how modern entertainment bends the knee to social media madness instead of designing entertainment with a purpose and maintaining that heading.
after season 3. so people can be thirsty about him for one more season.
at least it was only a side character they had to change...
melonie  this has nothing to do with the video  but your hair is always so one point.stunning.
say whaaat ! !  I wasn t impressed when I heard cavill was getting the starring role for s.1 but he absolutely bossed it!  s.2 made some poor choices and ended up being a bit dull and forgettable.  I have no faith in s.3 without henry playing geralt and no interest in watching it despite being an actual witcher fan.  well done netflix
for the record  you would be a great lara croft
henry is a fan of the witcher  and he s seeing that the entire concept is being completely disrespected  while over at warner they seem to be open to finally giving superman the treatment he deserves  so this is going to be a no-brainer for him.
they didn t deserve henry. so glad he s back as superman.
its been real. tokyo revengers is coming next year though so thats great news lol.
Im not saying hemsworth wont be good in the roll  but there s definitely something in the wind that made cavill decide to take his career some place else. we shall see I guess.
I dont even like the witcher s book and games  but even I recognise that it would be stupid to change its whole world-building and story on a whim  the witcher s world is solid  it feels alive and fleshed out and it doesnt need some pretencious writers that wants to destroy it
I was almost expecting to hear jeremy from  the quartering  playing his  rrrreimaginnnnned  soundbite.
a small price to pay  for man of steel 2!
I think its more to do with henry s new long term commitment to superman leading to his step down from the witcher showbut I do think both the show runners and netflix not using or following the source material made it easier for henry to step away the role and I cant blame him. even I know the show is God awful and Ive never watched it.
hit meup thanks for watching
I just cant help but view the liam casting as discount chris.
I hope they finally write the right superman movies for him. he was great as superman and geralt  but to this point he wasn t given the right material - in both cases.
one of the best modern remakes we ve had in years was medievil  because they updated the graphics and changed very little all hail sir dan!!
so sad
wife woke me up to say we are not watching the witcher anymore  turns out its because henry isn t in it anymore.
with henry quitting witcher not sure Im going to watch itseeing as he was one of the ones staying true to the source.
thatsucks it was one of the rare netflix productions that is actually watchable and good
cavil is supposed to be in tw3 enhanced edition so its not all bad.
from what I heard  its because they are openly against the source material. the writers want to do their own thing.Im getting very  game of thrones season 8  vibes
I honestly have not even wanted to watch season 2. has been sitting in my queue but the news that came trickling out about the changes to the story as that there was so much less focus on geralt to the point that he was almost like a minor character has made me rather indifferent to watching it. I am sticking to the books and games.
I respect henry cavill so much right now.Im calling it  cdprojekt is going to make female witchers a thing in the remake.anyone who hasn t bought the games on disk better do it now.
yeah  hard pass on season 4 without cavill
liam seems very excited to play geralt  its gonna be sad when everyone stops watching because henry cavill was their favorite part of the show and then netflix drops it because no one is watching
wel thats fine Im glad he finished the season
I heard they replaced him.. but I hadn t heard he   quit .   I suspect he probably had filming conflicts.   I love henry s positivity always.   if the wokeness becomes a too much I will quit watching the show... thats just really bad news.
seeing liam take over the reigns of a aegis like this after his emasculating miley sirus marriage is like trying to watch arnold schwarzenegger play an action role after he did the movie junior. cant take him serious in the role.
girls love henry cavill in the witcher.  news flash
with liam it will no longer be geralt of rivia but gary of rivia the imposter
shame the witcher tv series only has 3 seasons
after season 1 he said he would stay on as long as the writing was good  after season 2 he is done.
ha!
I appreciate your comment dm above to receive prize
bingo
smart guy
say it ain t so! how the hell could he quit  unbelievable! I love the witcher. I dont think its a terrible show at all.
henry was geralt. Im done with the netflix-series.
hImelonie for reporting this topic.I hope your weekend has been going well for you your family takecare melonie
welp  they had a good run.
love cavill s dedication to gerald. it was the only good thing about the show.
Im so happy  I hated this show  and love henry cavill  let s hope this tim around the extended universe he created hasn t completely ruined itself before he can come back to reign it in
this cant happen. who am I going to toss my coin to now
Im surprised cavill lasted as long as he did. he is passionate about the witcher world and was greatly displeased with ideology getting the nod over source material and story. he should have seen it coming and never signed on  imo. the top priority of show runner hissrich has always been pushing her agenda.
not even chris  its liam  chris s brother so not even thor is gonna play geralt lol.
I d say its a good thing. now no one has any reason to support a show with crap writers behind it  and calvin gets to work on a much bigger project where his opinion is taken seriously and he s happy.
used to say that embracing things like metaverse and other  social  network medias was like subverting youre mind to chinese style censorship... but with companies like cdpr and netflix dropping the drawers for esg... its something worse... cyberspace didn t have to suck  nor did the witcher
modern reimagining.  the death note.
I heard witcher the show got better on season two because they had the witcher character in it more finally but personally I was so bored with season one so I never got far enough to know personally if it got better
when  they say reimagined modern day you know thats a concern
remember how luke reacted when vader told him   Im your father   well thats how I feel about this. nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!
so about the witcher 1 remake its most likely the idea of geralt playing sexy pokemon thats going and I cant really say ill miss it as it kinda made you play to get the cards not because its what you wanted to pick  its the same problem that moral karm systems have you dont play the game your way you play it because you want to get max light or dark points so you get the best toys.
if they woke the witcher  the witcher is gonna go to sleep
so  as someone who only watched the first season  I d like opinions  given this news  should I still watch the rest of the cavil episodes  cause Im sure not watching whatever comes next.
there seems to be a problem with a few of his characters.
0 53 speaking of tomb raider  there was a recent article saying tomb raider deserves a  resident evil style remake.  is thatsomething you d be down for  melonie  or do you think there d be problems  I d post the link but youtube freaks out over comments with links in them
you like watching crap
@bruce  I liked watching the witcher. probably not now though.
watch season 2 episode 1  then just imagine the rest is good and watch no more. ignore that advice at your peril
@bruce  lmao  thanks
depends on the people running the production probably. that would be my reaction. that  and they should keep lara as the tough-as-nails girl thatshe was before the reboot. Im not a fan of the old school the way melanie is  but thats because I joined late in the game. its the mid to late 2000 games that are near and dear to my heart  and were a blast to play.
just discovered you and 2nd video Ive watched. I like your voice.
good job kid.
for context   imagine if the you7tuber were a hot archeologist willing to play lara croft as an archeologist  but the show runners demanded a  gender studies  major to play a hollywood interpretation of an archeologist for croft.
04 00   no offence to chris hemsworth   she said  d see  thats the guy we would rather see in that role  even she knows
the only reason I watched it was because Im a huge fan of cavill. damn shame.
ngl  it d be cool if you could choose between henry cavill and doug cockle s voices for geralt in the witcher remake.
give liam hemsworth a shot  all good. definitely will still watch it.
is there a reason now to even invest the hours on his last season  season 3 will be coming out soon then after that  it will be with the new actor. honestly  Im conflicted. Im positive 90  of us all watched the series purely because of henry cavill. he made the show.
I liked sezon 1 and was hyped for sezon 2. I was thinking that ye sezon one wasnt that good but it was a fing witcher right. I watched 2 epizodes of sezon 2 and that was that  d
I think it would be better if liam was a different witcher  that way henry can come back do guest appearance as gerald now and then. think that would be a better.
they dont need to make a modern reimagining of something from something as recent as 2007  unless they want to inject social issues and other politics into it.  in the past  I remember that they d only  remake something from way longer back in time  like the 1950s to 1970s and just update it to recent times but only with regards to fashion  decor  technology  etc.
you know you got it. the dream
the show is ok and the casting switch does make me less likely to watch. but it could be cool to shake things up in terms of the witcher world. make the new season about the nilfgaardian army demanding the submission of the viper school and other witcher schools. have someone like letho be the focus.
at least I dont have to reactivate my netflix account now.
not going to lie  I never even heard of the witcher but when I saw my guy henry I gave it a chance and was hooked ever since. Im not even gonna disrespect liam and even give it a try because I ll just be comparing him to henry. liam bruh just say no this is not good for you man.
I couldn t get past season 1.  it was mildly entertaining in parts  and others were flat-out boring.  cavill was a great geralt  he s a great superman  and I look forward to his future works.
well season 3 is all for me. good job netflix. smh
henry cavill is geralt of rivia.I wont watch witcher without henry cavill.
its already telling when a lot of people keep mixing up the brothers.
Imean his back was probably getting tired of carrying thatshow and getting no appreciation from the show runners for it.they made a show about a monster hunting sex magnet and made him secondary to woke narratives
they should have just made liam a different witcher or something and made him the mc for thatseason as someone else to leave the door open for the real geralt to return after superman.
I thought it was chris hemsworth replacing  was like  eh  its not that bad   but now I know so now im like neh
I feel like the only way replacing cavill would work is if season 4 is prequel. liam looks a lot younger and could be a good younger garalt. also  Im hoping modernization of the witcher just means updated combat mechanics and quest direction because that first game is old school as hell. Im not worried about them going woke on this. cyberpunk is still pretty recent and that game gets absolutely gta in terms of ridiculousness and it feels like it celebrates how raunchy it is. I feel comfortable with this remake and hope that it comes to consoles since the original is still locked on pc.
so we lose geralt and get superman back huh
the second season was terrible.  Im glad he made the wise choice to leave thatsinking ship.  what a difference from the first season.
hoping this makes itso that they reboot the show and actually try to make the witcher. I dont know how yennifer became the main character in the show. while geralt was just some side character love interest for yen. its called  the witcher  itshould be about geralt who is the main character. itshould look like house of the dragon meets Lord of the rings. itshould not be clean or cg. itshould be grounded and historical looking while taking place in a fantasy setting. itshould be about killing monsters as political factions rise and fall in the background that geralt gets tangled up in. and geralt should have a beard. I know there are times when he s clean shaven but he looks best when he has a beard. cavil still could pull it off if the ladies really need the fangirl crush. but make it about geralt killing monsters and getting tangled up in the politics of the warring kingdoms around him. if you do that it will be good. if you need to have a female protagonist itshould be about ciri. yen and triss should be main love interests and powerful secondary characters. they should be important but not the main focus. the main character should be geralt and if you want a secondary female storyline focus on ciri. ultimately what you should be focusing on is just being true to the witcher universe and story. thats all the fans are asking.
3 58 no offense to chris hemsworth  he will not be able to fill in liam neeson s boots.
I wish these damn writers would try harder to make these stories better instead of trying to destroy the series.
great news for dc fans. now we can get superman soon
I hate to hear this about henry cavill  for me he was the only reason Imanaged to make it through the entire show of the witcher on netflix because oh my God it was so bad
this would be like making a movie where mark hamill would hate playing luke skywalker.
wait  there is a 3rd season out there
if you wanna english version of andrzej sapkowskI  then I recommend andrew sup  cowskI  itshould sound quite well
damn that hurts Im done watching then lol was good
it would be like refusing an offer by satan to become bruce campbell - only if ash was a side character in a soap opera - no deal
what do the showrunners dislike about the witcher to begin with  the books are great  well written and not campy or full of  young adult  clich s.  what is there to dislike  good storytelling
good for henry. fuck these companies trying to destroy art.
if I had to chose between being superman or the witcher I d choose superman. but thats just me.thatsaid I will check out liam as the witcher. I have the advantage of never having read the books or playing the games. I will read the books eventually.
lol you called him chris man thats gotta sting  he must get that a lot.
as you can see  they re still trying to destroy all heroes and all franchises.
thanks for watching I really appreciate  message me by the name above to receive gifts
only stick to the games and the books  or other trustworthy media. never trust netflix
we haven t had any recent movies with luke skywalker.
@bruce  are you kidding me
probably that it doesnt confirm to their world view.that the mc is male and competent with an exotic flair that catches the eyes o t ladies.the whole patriarchy diatribe.
there is just one problem with this article  the devs was not saying the two words  modern reimagining !!!
whenever someone starts a sentence with the word imagine makes thatstatement hard to believe. lol
of course he quits  he got to be superman again.
chris hemsworth....last thor movie  his brother
yep. another modern reimagined rings of power adaptation echo.
well was awesome while it lasted.  wonder if it went woke and hc said bye bye
toss a coin for your witcher...
pretty funny how dc now wants to use him as superman again  I think he s chasing the bigger paycheck.
no more witcher without cavill
I ll probably still watch  but cavill was and always will be the only true white wolf.  he captured geralt perfectly and trying to top that is like trying to top heath ledger as joker.  now the only question is   will liam be the next phoenix...  or leto
the question is  who needs another superman movie
it is good tho. yeah we lost a witcher show. but it was going on the wrong direction and henry cavill knew it. you can hear it his voice in interviews.
I bet liam is a fan of the witcher because of cavil and not the books game.
he left to be superman.
liam   oh please  I like him  I hope he knows that he will step up into ones shoes and into a broken series
honestly  I love liam hemsworth but henry cavill is the reason I watched the show! I love the witcher and henry is geralt to me. he embodied the white wolf and both loved and respected the book and games. once henry is gone  Im done.
they already messed up big time on thatshow. he was the only one carrying the show.
there was a lot of things about the show that I didn t care for  but I watched it because cavill was great in it. no reason to watch after season 3.
liam...damn. what s the betting pool on this news backlash has netflix cancelling after season 3 now
I honestly dont think it has anything to do with money or his sm role. I think something in season 3 is so off the rails  that cavill was like  nope  I am out . he loved that role too much to quit due to money  and I am sure he could have worked around scheduling conflicts with the sm role. add to that  no one likes that hemsworth. he has only gotten roles because of his brother anyways. Imean I would have less of a problem if they got mads mikkelsen or something. but damn. this franchise is dead.

welp. thats it for the witcher  I guess. but if you ve no gripes on subtitles. just watch the polish tv series the hexer. thats their own witcher adaptation.albeit that got cancelled  too  of course.
henry cavill must return he is geralt of rivia as much hugh jackman is wolverine
modern re imagining would seem technical but there is that video where cdpr has essentially embraced esg. not sure on the remake. it will be a wait and see for me. no hype  no preorder  I ll just wait till its released and see what gamers are saying about it.
not hemsworth!!! rip
people said heath ledger had no chance of matching jack nicholson as the joker. give liam a chance.
I hope that by  modern reimagined  they mean better graphics  a bigger world map and open world with some new side quests a a modern gameplay similar to the the witcher 3  but the story and the rest stays the same.
did not really like last season  and based off this news I am starting to think that next season will be the last season of this show due to the writing and now the character change.  I dont think this is a good move for  hemsworth  unless all he is doing it for is a pay check.  I wish they would find actors that really like the character they are portraying and not just for a pay check.
cavill can see the trainwreck ahead  so he is simply getting off before reaching it! at least the dceu will have a good movie coming out soon.
modern reimagining code for going woke apparently netflix didn t take notes from amazon s rings of power or disney s she-hulk.
I think we all should be aware that henry being super fan or advising lauren is also part of the very good marketing they have and the marketing strategy they drained it out.changinf the  actually main character  or one of 3 main characters or the main character the people cared the most is devastating. for sure for me it is. it doesnt look good either way.cavil choosing big dc money  taking the two lead roles  superman in upcoming movies and the witcher is rather difficult  witcher per episode is 1 milion   and dc movie 20  or cavil left because if the shit happening on the set or mix of the two. all of the reasons  are bad.
liam hemsworth needs to play the games and read the books. he might become a die hard fan.. and then go in the same narrative cavill wanted. the writers cant replace geralt more then once.
if they write it in where witcher is killed then the new man can come along will work.if they try just changing him will not work
this really bums me out. no one can replace him as geralt.  ill watch season 3  but when he is gone  so am I  and I bet that goes for most of the fans
if he decided to leave.. must be very baaaaaaad
wow  imagine how much worse the show will be now that the only person that cares about the lore is no longer part of the crew.rip
since henry and the dude in charge of xmen  94  the same guy who warned people that netflix witcher is filled with people who hate the books and games  left  that tells us that now these people have full reign to go as ham on the new season all they want. possibly got season 8 levels of crap. this is why you should make sure that all show adaptions of popular media have people behind the scenes are fans of said media.
damn I guess with superman back on the table henry would rather do that then work in a witcher show ran by non fans.
I d rather wait longer for cavill to continue with the series than to change out the lead role and lose all authenticity.
dc got more ws in 2weeks than marvel had in two years
I d love to hold out hope that  modern reimagining  will mean updated tech..........but not too much
the writers hate the material  so yea if a fan is playing a character  yes they will quit.
its a show called the witcher and he s a background character.
I hate this but Im starting to see that this isn t the only problem starting with the fact that every single show is going so woke and they just dont care about the consequences anymore. we as fans have made ourselves known and they just dont care. esg is here to stay until we destroy the ultimate organizations behind it.  we know who they are we just need to have leadership in place that wont sell out to the globalist cabal.
it is a sad day for witcher fans.
guess season 3 will be the last one I will watch  I dont have faith in liam to be able to do the character justice. but I can understand why cavil decided to do it  he is a fan of witcher and source material was not respected and that obviously rubbed him of the wrong way.
cd project red has recently announced that they will bring their games more inline with blackrocks esg score.so yeah it will most likely be woke.
little reason to watch the next season at this point
season 3 must be a real stinker.or something else is going on here. not like there is going to be that many superman movies he couldn t keep filming witcher. unless there s a lot of interconnected justice league stuff planned.andrzej is just andr  Im pretty sure. polish spelling  probably the origin of the name for all I know.
I cut netflix when they thought cuties was a good idea so I diddnt catch most of this series
I wont discount hemsworth without at least giving him a fair shot. I dont have much hope for the show as is  much less without henry. we ll see.
he was too good for this show anyway  playing second fiddle to the raceswapped  strong independent wahmen who dont need no man
around this time they say it got a massive influx of buyers cyber punk was heavily discounted I picked it up for  20 aus
of course he s leaving.he got superman back.not one man in human history would turn down playing superman to play geralt.
well done with thatshow now.
if henry cavill quit and the writers apparently hate the source material  then I think Im no longer watching the show. I never even read the books or played the games  but I still think its a disrespect to make a show while hating on what made it possible in the first place.
not even he himself could make the show good. he made the right choice to distance himself  from this  show
no this is very good. he s jumping ship for superman and highlander. are you crazy
I agree with caville s move. he has no job security with witcher anyway. his character has been regulated to the sidelines and feminists are pushing other characters over his part. at least as superman he is completely undisputed as the main character and probably has a good 3 or 4 more movies to make money from. just count the superman movies and justice league where superman is the main hero. smart move.
chris hemsworth looks like a ken doll from toy story   I wont be able to take the show seriously with a change like that .
I cannot understand the mindset of working on an adaption for an ip you hate.
why does everything in entertainment needs a modern take
who the hell is liam hemsworth
you cant blame the guy. I d leave to playing second fiddle to a race swapped yennefer although the title depicts otherwise.
you know he had to take a look at what these idiots were planning for future seasons and just went   nope!  rip witcher series...we hardly knew thee.
you cant be a witcher fan and also be a fan of netflix witcher. the show has nothing to do with the witcher books or games  especially after season 2. good thing that they killed off eskel  that makes it 100  clear that this show is not connected anymore to the source material. you cant even call it bad fan fiction  since we now know the creators actively hate the books and games.
modern reimagining just means its going to be massively woke.same with reboot  if they used the word remastering  it would mean with modern graphics and gameplay.but they didn t use the word remastering did they
you say bad news I say it is good news since I can now guilt free drop witcher after season 3
I have a hard time putting witcher 3 above witcher 1. although tw3 was great with its story and effort put into it  it also had this ubisoft game feel that I hate. tw1 is insanely immersive  though you have to be able to adapt to its un-intuitive combat mechanics.
he actually quited to make superman movies  just sayin.
as a witcher fan this sucks but so did season 2 and the only reason a super fan like henry would walk from this show is if season 3 was more of the same. he was as vocal as he legally could be over how disappointed he was with the direction of the show. so Im not upset here  I appreciate henry s respect for fans of the source material and telling us not to waste our time with season 3.
are you kidding !  melonie Im a huge fan of the witcher series and Im an olive toned arab.  for modern audiences   I was looking forward to gaming it on my pc a remastered witcher 1 would ve been beautiful smh great now Im pissed
if he has been secretly cast as cregan stark..... that could be why
this is why Ive given up on tv  movie and game adaptations and just stick with reading the books.
ugh   thats rough.
I get the impression that the writers and directors feel like the problem with the witcher is that it has too much of the witcher in it  so finally they ve gotten rid of him altogether.
Im not a huge fan of the tv show  mainly due to the race swapping and  with a few exceptions  general bad casting  but I didn t really hear anyone in the cast and crew respond to criticism with  you are all just racists.  Imean  after she-hulk and rings of power  is it really that bad
cavill left... rip witcher
I wish liam the best but I wont be watching the next season... I d need to have a netflix subscription for that.
ahhhhh im so upset
I am not sure I care if liam hemsworth is a big fan. he lacks both the stature and demeanor to properly bring the character to life . if there is a season 5  I would be shocked.
because people keep voting left
netflix subscriber drop incoming  me thinks. I re-subbed for tw season1 and was disappointed enough with all the race swaps that I canceled as soon as I had watched the first episode.and yes  the games so far have absolutely established the characters and how they are to be portrayed. the games were the medium that made the story available to a wider audience  I only read the books afterwards and while translations are always problematic to some degree  they are decent at best  english translation .yeah  yeah  call me an -istaphobe all you want  I ll wear it as a badge of honour.
how many shows have to bomb before these writers learn no one wants their reinterpretations
there were only 2 good things with yhe witcher which got people watching it  cavill as geralt and the fight scenes with geralt. both of which would disappear with cavill gone.
also cavill is the nerd fan and like you said making fun of it didn t help his decision
I think the remake will be fine. cdpr doesnt have a history of doing work stuff  so I think they re just retelling an arc of a very popular character from what was a very rough game.
better he keep to his true sense of self. just as well  shame on liam for joining in. should let itsink to teach a lesson  though it likely still will with altered acting styles which will affect the show  but still. henry leaves a role to make a point and liam shows up like  screw your point!  wasn t a liam h. fan before  less so now.
season 1 was ok  I was able to watch it a few times ... I couldn t finish season 2 .... the show runners and writers have already destroyed the show
choomba you can interrupt me from getting ready for work  and leaving any day. those dogs going crazy amuse me. idk cd porjektred  seem to piss off alot of people  remember they did the cyberpunk edgerunner anime and that took off and that wasnt woke. cdporjekt red should take over tomb raider  and I think it will be fixed. like I said cd projekt red fixes things and lives up to there word so far  so I think they will do a good job  with the witcher show.
all I heard is the show stops at season 3
so cavil s witcher will be replaced by thor 2.0  I get his choice though he s sticking with the better more iconic character of the two.
I stated the witcher series with the witcher 3 game... I loved itso much started reading the books and playing the witcher 1  and 2... well the witcher 1 was for me unplayable. the combat and controls were so different I could not get into it  I think many fans feel the same about it... witcher 2 was good but not as epic of a story and not as impactful as 3... the problem a lot of fans have for netflix witcher series is they cut sooooo many important aspects of the story that my mom  not familiar with books and game lore  was lost in and constantly had to ask me to fill in the blanks... yet netflix witcher series added useless crap that negates the lore of the franchise... like yennifer s backstory  like why  also made yen a young inexperienced sorceress and that was triss... yet triss in the series seems to be the older more experienced sorceress... so they got the characters wrong. and when the mess too much up they alienate the fans.
yep and Im dropping the series after season 3.
rip witcher. 3 seasons is a good run.
come on melonie do the reimagining  like the  quartering
its good news for real witcher fans. we may hope that this abomination will end soon. netflix f..ed up this franchise so bad that it would be hard to restore it  but if they cancel this show soon enough  we may hope thatsomeone someday will do the justice to the source material.
actually since he s playing superman now one could argue it could be a good thing. especially since the writers have zero respect for the games and books
good news for superman fans tho
the only thing about the movie worth watching has left. good luck liam hemsworth whoever you are.
good for him...liked him better as superman.
its actually a good newshe s a great geralt in a terrible version of the witcher world
as for the witcher games I hope they take the time needed to make a great game  I ll happily wait ... please learn from and dont repeat cyberpunk.
henry deserved better
need to clone henry cavil so he can play both the witcher   superman!
liam hemsworth is a decent actor but he s still going to be seen as a poor mans replacement for henry cavill.
guess Im cancelling netflix since I cant share a password with my family in the near future anyway.
he was the only one holding it together and kept me watching . season 3 is the last one I will watch. maybe not even  considering how mediocre the 2nd season was.
he s a fan of the lore and the show is probably going the way of halo and he doesnt want to be part of the sh t show.
their loss.henry is a great man and a great actor.but these days is not important for most people.
6 00 I wonder where this news outlet got that comment from because in the original cdpr release there was nothing of  modern reimaniging . they said they modernize the game by moving to unreal 5 and will rebuild the game mechanics from ground up - and in all fairness since we re talking about witcher 1 here which had some pretty bad gameplay mechanics  the combat in particular  this is absolutely needed.the graphics where already not up to date anymore when the game released in 2007 which means a remake of the graphics is sorely needed.in short - nothing in the cdpr post said anything about changing the game on anything but technical levels.last but not least - youre us american. cdpr is not. this cultural problem youre talking about is mostly a us american  canadian and australian problem. europeans have a much more realistic take on life.
@melonie mac go boom love the content! is this your only channel and platform
Im aware of five remakes of 2000s games so far  call of duty modern warfare 1 and 2  star wars kotor  dead space  and now the witcher. I hope this isn t the beginning of a 10 year trend of just  re-imagining  older  better games to fit with modern pc ideas of society.
I love tank tops with no bras  thank you
why not just wait for him to be free
best part of the show. nothing against the guy but liams season will tank lol
happy he s returning as superman  but liam hemsworth  liam hemsworth !liam fucking hemsworth! ! ! ! ! !
honestly I think this is a good thing. the witcher has been going woke and I dont think henry wants to be apart of that. so we get superman back and he doesnt have to go down with the ship for the witcher. Im not watching the show without him in it. so the witcher is officially dead
just stop it at season three. geralt wont have the same leverage with liam  no matter how good an actor he is.
bet you it turns out the director wants to make it woke witcher we already heard the staff making it hate the game and main character
no person should be forced to do something they dont want to do. tom selleck famously lost his chance to play indiana jones because they wouldn t let him out of his contract with magnum p.i. that was a pretty common occurrence back then  but those days are long gone  and the industry is better for it. personally  I would prefer that cavill continue to play geralt  but Im going to reserve my judgement until I see what hemsworth does with the role.
the witcher  thats me out.
I saw the cdpr drop on their approach to esg.  it got 266 thumbs-up and 5 371 thumbs-down as of 42 979 views.
that really sucks you cant replace henry caville. liam can play thor really well but that doesnt mean he s perfect for the witcher
modern reimagining is code word for let s add a political agenda in this movie tv show
its a good thing. the trade off is cavill gets to focus on superman and all that. he is better valued somewhere where they care more about the source material. we at least know that james gunn is competent  unlike netflix - which hires writers that hate the source material.
yes cdpr has basically bowed to esg...
its gonna be cancelled after liam s 1st season guaranteed.
wasn t a big fan of the witcher show  even though I was really looking forward to it. I just hope cavill has a better time with dc movies this go around.
not only you being part of a tomb raider production but you also playing lara croft...... and quitting
its a well known fact that writers do their best work when they despise the source material...
well thats me out I will not even bother to give it a go
replacing henry cavill as geralt is like replacing robert downey jr. as iron man. you just cant....
henry loves the characters and the world and when netflix starts to add gender racial politics and change the story  I find I can not blame him
netflix doesnt want to be outdone by amazons Lord of the rings their like look we can fuck up a show too
I just dont understand why people who have no knowledge  interest  or love of the source material would want to sign on to make this  or any other  show. they re doing a disservice to the ip  actors  and especially their fans. how canthese people expect these projects to thrive and make money
liam hemsworth  .. why    there has gotta be a better option than him
game sounds as awesome as saints row remake lol.
season 2 was pretty good. who ever the producers are. really need to pick up the books an actually read them or better yet play the video games an follow it for the proper story. Im definitely not watching if henry not playing the witcher
cd project red are studio from my country and is located in my hometown. they are far from the woke policy and they show it many time. lets hope they dont go this way.
Im gonna miss him as geralt of rivia. but if the witcher fulls off the maps after the news broke out I wont be watching it anymore.
they should of been respectful of the source material then maybe he would of stayed
I cant say Im surprised. this says a lot about the state of the series behind the scenes. as you say for a witcher fan to ditch the role of geralt  things have got to be bad. I thought s1 was decent  s2 not so much. itspoke volumes when it came out that a portion of the writers actively dislike the franchise. that kind of thing really disheartens me  not only do they go off and make their own woke trash  they have to infect and destroy things they have no interest in. I no longer look forward to any film or tv series. odds are now its going to suck  and I find myself being surprised when something is good. stuff I used to love I now dont give a second thought when the latest release hits the scene. media is in such a bad spot right now  and I dont see that changing any time soon. these companies dont even seem to care they lose money  they double down on the wokeness to appease the mob.
as a huge witcher fan  main games  online gwent  books and everything in between . this was the best news Ive heard this weekend. now I just want this shitshow to get cancelled
also  pretty sure the remake will change triss to look like the actress from the netflix show.
the witcher season 3 is coming out in the summer of  23... if the season is badly  re viewed why renew it already for a fourth season why announce hemsworth as cavill s replacement  right now  superman  a new guy ritchie movie  a new matthew vaughn movie maybe james bond and maybe the highlander... cavill is a busy man so it could be a scheduling issue.
thatstar wats girl will be happy tho.
the only show that can confidently change actors for the main character and keep the numbers up is dr who!!!any time a show has changed actors for a main character they find out pretty quick how fast the fans will walk away and this will be no different. at least we get superman back I guess but after henry leaves I for one am not interested in seeing thors lesser known brother take over the role. supermanasgeralt notthorswimpybrother
I ll bet he quit because he s big on the actual established lore but the showrunners are not.  he s got some creative control of superman so better to do that.
as a  blank  fan. . .   - liam helmsworth   every modern actor  actress out there!Imean really   did anyone expect him to say anything else  which is sad  because it casts doubt on actors who are actual  fans  of something.
Im a witcher fan and having henry as a superman instead of geralt makes me happy. geralt should not be looking that good and charming after all.
big shoes to fill.
by how  remakes for modern audience  are going  I assume that  modern audience  is both stupid and entittled.
I loved the first season of the witcher. the second season was a terrible slog until the end. even if the third season returns to form  I doubt I ll bother with season four without cavill.
season 4  thecorrupt twisted witcher .
I loved the show....im sure hemsworth will do a fine job. he seems enthusiastic  and is determined to do his best. Im surprised to hear that people didn t like the show. I guess Ive been living under a rock for 3 years  because Ive heard nothing but good praise for the show......im dead serious this is first negatives Ive heard about the show. I have a feeling that these negative reviews are only surfacing because of henry cavils stepping down.....this is sadly how the world works. all the reviews on the web mostly positive or great....8.2 isn t bad last time I checked....I do understand that people have different opinions.
well I wasn t going to watch season 3 so no loss there.
remakes are either really good or really horrendous.
this is why I am worried that the fallout series will get screwed.
why bad news lol! most fans left after season 2
this is sad but as well kinda does not bother me. to be honest  I barely got trough season 1 and then watched not even whole episode 1 of season 2 and then gave up. I first found out witcher as old tv series from 2000 when I was a kid. now I know that was not received well by book fans. but I did enjoyed it. when games came along I jumped on them and I wanna read the books when I get bit of a free time. just this tv show kinda disappointed me. henry was the best part about it for sure.
welp guess I ain t watching netflix anymore
why do so many writers feel the need to rewrite characters and their stories  if they dont like them  work on a show that you enjoy writing on.
many witcher game fans and witcher book fans have been unhappy since the beginning with casting choices  and how they handled the stories. I hated what they did casting for triss and yennifer  they aren t what we wanted  but what the diverse politics today want.
@faeres munkeyes  I didn t mind them.....Im not an angry keyboard warrior like you guys lol
@kevin harvey  voicing an opinion makes us angry keyboard warriors
bad news for witcher  good news for superman!
I love she wishes no offence to chris hemsworth
henry is a likable guy and all  but neither he or any other actor can hold a candle to the geralt from the games. never watched the show btw.
I love your voice
they just destroyed half of the first season and later 90  of the second season. in an interview henry cavill said that he will be geralt until the point where the writers and the showrunners are faithful for the source material  they were not  so he quit. he is a professional  he could have been the witcher and superman simultaniusly. I am a hardcore witcher fan  played the games and read the books and the show butchered the sourc materials  so Im with henry cavill 100 .
witcher 1 woke remake will use the tv show as a guide for diversity inclusion and equity. they ll certainly add more  but the show will be the starting point.
so what Im hearing is its not going to be as good cause they re gonna crap on the source material
I felt bad for him. he really hit the witcher character out of the park. the writing and the entire show focusing on yennifer more than cirI  geralt and triss combined was cringy. I would of left as well.
the first season was ok. but the second season was so bad  one week after watching it I basically forgot everything that happened.
I dont watch super hero movies  except deadpool   so I ll likely never see cavil as superman  but I loved season 1 of the witcher. season 2 was not put together well at all. I have since cancelled netflix for good  so I wont see the new replacement either.
what about the highlander remake
its not too early! they mentioned that they are implementing  esg  the american version of the ccp social creditscore to their company
yeah okey then I cant continue to watch this series  I wonder what my wife has to say about that lol.
if I remember correctly  cavill was the only reason why this show got made in the first place. he pushed for itsince the beginning. oh well  guess this show is dead.
I couldn t care less about the witcher personally. Ive got no interest in the games  books  or show. thatsaid  I genuinely feel for the fans of the show. I understand that cavill probably had no choice but to give up the role in order to go back to superman. even so  it doesnt change the fact that no matter how good liam is in the role  its still not quite going to be the same.
thats the same as the halo tv people who said they never played the game.
I d much rather see cavill as kal el. any day of the week. screw these showrunners that dont know their asses from their elbows already.
I reckon he wanted his face back. netflix the face stealers. I wouldn t sell my face for a franchise Im a fan of either
netflix should just consider this the end of the witcher franchise. seeing as though henry cavill actually cared about the lore of the book as well as played the video games. which basically means this show is doomed now. lol
I hope cdpr doesnt pull a wokey and make a saints row reboot  cause aye we all remember cyberpunk 2077 launch right
I dont think their gonna make a season 4 after 3 its gonna get canceled
never played the game or read the books. as such  the series didn t bother me all that much. I ll give hemsworth a chance
thor swooping in to take the spot
as someone who couldn t even make it past the 2nd episode of season 2 after seeing what they did to eskel  this doesnt surprise me. this makes me wonder how big of a shitshow season 3 will be if it made henry quit...
the books will always be good  and the witcher 3 game will always be worth a replay.  especially with the 4k remake on the horizon.  the hollywood poxy crews can not touch what has been already made and successful.
liams jawline too soft for the witcher.
what would you think if all the cybernetics were a byproduct of the elvish empire is trying to take over the world and cyberpunk because of the necker plague being the elvish war machine
there s something very authentic and cute about you.
I could understand henry ditching the witcher because of a bunch of asshats who knows nothing of a franchise and wishes to destroy it in the form of bad fanfiction. also  so happy he s back as superman. I hope he gets a proper sequel.
I liked henry cavill in the role  but honestly  they need to fix the writing or something  regardless of what actor they have as geralt. the first season was all over the place  but it kept me interested. the second season was kind of bad imo. my interest is pretty low at this point.
haha she says gauralt instead of henry cavil @1 54
I ll just add that as far as I cantell  having watched only season 1  that the second season of the series might as well be called the witches because Ive heard that geralt hardly features in his own show due to the overdone levels of estrogen-based content.funny how that keeps happening. its all part of the  for modern audiences  tripe that the talentless keep producing
be honest have you ever said  melonie mac go boom  just before farting
henry and joey batey  jaskier  were the best part of the series  in all honesty. it was badly paced as in boring  the casting was lackluster other than those two  and I got fed up with token black people getting shoehorned into every other scene. as a fan of the books  and Ive read them all   yes  Im aware of how vague sapkowskI is in describing his characters often times and I can already hear some out there bleating   its a fantasy series what does it matter.  but still  the continent is effectively medieval central and eastern europe  where there were no black people  that Im aware of . call me  rahcist  all you like for just stating the truth. I wish hemsworth all the luck in stepping into this series  and credit to henry for being a class act about this  as Ive come to expect from him.
as much of shame as it is to see cavill leave the witcher series. cause let s face it. he carried it thus far. least he wont be dragged down with the crap netflix is doing with show.
sad!
wasn t the first witcher game kind of bad  if so  I dont think  reimagining  is a bad thing.
did he quit  netflix ended his contract  but itsounds better if he ended it.
why dont they just remake the witcher as a tumblr cartoon for modern audiences just like they did to thundercats
modern re-imagining  - that means its going woke and will ultimately go broke.
oh if you see what I say about this the place of powers thing thats so that the way that inserts not what they do anymore can be used for like common actions during cut scenes because well recycle the places of power things are different
oh you were wondering Im pretty sure its a caving thats supposed to destroy all these books that a caving would never destroy them and stuff like that to where you play the bio integrated cyborg witcher that will have resistance to the neck you get to select a body styles and face but thats to match you up with its hard to explain probably would get cut from the game but right now they re sort of an evolution process based in mutagen in your entryway into the main map battlefield like youre not a witcher at first because you dont have the mutagens its video game right now a cybernetic system interprets nanotech stuff its a big power up twist thing to where you can have a lead off against a giant war machine that people are pretending they re not using against you its weird it makes for some pretty complex story progression surrounding aid from other planets
hit meup thanks for watching
season 3 must be that bad.
hello flailing arms girl. yes itsucks henry is ditching witcher. Imean  you gotta go where the money is right
I thought it was fake news  cavill loved the witcher.
this is great news  henry s talent was being wasted on the witcher series. it could have been great if the show had a decent writing team.
good! stupid crappy woke netflix series dont deserve henry. he is one of the only leading men these days I actually like who isn t woke offscreen. I hope he eventually gets the lead in a real fantasy epic where we get to see him lead armies and actually have more than like 1 sword fight per season. immortals was badass even with everything wrong with that movie. he needs another role like that  that lets him be the badass he is.
he s a fan. why would a fan want to be part of what they were doing
they re even doing a witcher remake of the video game and will be  re-imagining it for modern audiences .everything they touch turns to .
we live in a time where entertainment franchises commut suicide in order to gain popularity through the hatred of the fans  these idiotic show writers think pissing everyone off equals fame and success.... lmfao
it all comes down to the money - he took the bigger payday  the show was really silly imo
I love how companies think pandering to the 1  of twitter and the 2  of the global population will make money.
there was a 3rd season
henry cavill was the only reason I watched thatshow.  I wanted to support him.  I liked the show and the legitimate interest henry cavill had in the game lore.  it really is a shame the witcher had writers that didn t even like the games.  if you dont like the franchise s story and lore  why take it on bunch of damn narcissists.
smart man.
hard pass. cdpr went woke with the witcher remake game   likely the rest of their properties at this point. netflix already has a record for doing this as well. more s the pity.
Ive never played the witcher games but I have been a big fan of the show.I cant imagine anyone but cavill playing geralt. the season 4 is going to flop and I dont imagine there will be a season 5
they have an example with rings of power on why this is a horrible idea
yep. another modern reimagined saints row 2022 adaptation echo. let s hope thats not the case.
get  rings of power     dr.who  scriptwriters who are available for new work  let s really f this up.
why would you need to reimagine the witcher for a modern audience  Imean even the jonas brothers are older than the books.
I really liked season one  once I figured out how it was being structured. season two was mediocre at best.
well  I was on the fence about it before. but  Im out now!
huge fan of the books.smaller fan of the games.had no interest in the show the second I saw how they cast yenn and triss.haven t watched an episode  and I wont. hope he moves back over to superman.
oh but melonie season 2 was good. I understand what they did in season 1 but I did not like that direction either. it can honestly be skipped to the finale imo.
cavill was the best part of the show. even with him they jacked up season 2. after season 3 Im out..
the first witcher game getting a do over or modern reimagining is great news because the mechanics of the first game were overly complicated and clunky. the graphics also haven t aged well at all.
season 3 is last for me
wait  seriously  if thats the case then rip the witcher tv show. henry pretty much solo carried it. without him its flaming garbage.
did she call him chris at 3 59
those netflix writers are stupid for hating the source material. having read the books and playing the game  thats what fans expect  so what s wrong with using it  its so dumb that they choose to be defiant against what we want.
imagine a best selling african fantasy novel then adapting the characters to reflect  modern  society. do they not see the double standard
superman is needed more in this era and henry is the man to do itthe witcher show is lost Im not interested in it and its dropped off the top show lists a while ago
well the only reason I even was able to finish season 2...Im out. nothing against hemsworth  but Im afraid there will be no defense for the story line.
Imean  can you blame him
I never read the books or played the games but even from watching the show yennefer felt more like the protagonist than  the witcher  himself geralt  and I lost interest halfway through the second season. I doubt I ll be watching any more without henry cavill being in the show.
I dont want to see henry cavil age out on 7 season of some cheap witcher netflix show.I want to see henry move on to much bigger things like coming back as superman or a 007 role before he is too old.very smart decision by henry much more money  much bigger role.
there going to she hulk it. modern reimagining
why anyone  including henry cavill  would believe any director or writer would stick to either the books or games for the storyline of a tv show blows my mind. from the start they didn t follow the story  and changed many things that completely ruined it as a tv show in season 1. this tv show is not for any witcher fans
what witcher fans   they were cavill fans.
this just in  the witcher season 4 draws embarrassingly low numbers after henry cavil is replaced by liam hemsworth  the younger less talented brother of thor and an actor that absolutely nobody wanted to see play geralt. and thats not a prediction. thats a spoiler.
when you force the God emperor of nerds to quit woke witcher  the mysandrist showrunners have doomed this next season for them.
he probably seen the woke writing on the wall and bailed. I dont blame him
I have a feeling witcher will be straying from its original format in season 1 and will suck.  henry in return is abandoning the role and returning to superman.
the wife and her cavill club just disbanded hahaha
even if the replacement actor was a good one  changing the main character is a nono.oh and we all know henry left because the show is a woke sinking ship. imagine being a real fan and quitting  not sus at all.
this is one of the worst news I have heard  henry is and will always be the only geralt for me  he embodied him so well  for some he is the reason the show is even watchable. changing the actor for the main freaking character of a show is just super bad  maybe he didn t like the writing  who knows  but whatever this is.. it made me loose interest in the show as a whole  I liked it very much but with this change I just dont see myself watching from s4 onwards with a different actor  its going to feel so off and weird cause its still going to be geralt  like seeing the new actor interacting with yen and ciri.. its a different person man lol. show is gonna get cancelled at s4 for sure  its just sad.
I gave the show up halfway during season two.I have all the books  so I dont really need to watch the tv show.
melonie..melonie... marry me! youre so gorgeous
dude has like sooo much stuff lined up its understandable  jame bond rumors  new highlander reboot  mission impossible again rumor   annnnnd he commin back for superman
nothing against liam  but these are boots too big for anyone but henry cavill to fill. I feel sorry he has such a daunting mountain to climb  and already with so much resistance.
if hemsworth would be a witcher fan he wouldnt have accepted the part in the first place. I guess money talks louder than reason.ps  being an entertainment journalist at this point you could have looked up at least how others pronounce sapkowskI s name  love.
the headline should read  henry cavill leaves  the anya chalotra show!  no one cares.
Ive said it before and I will keep saying it  as a slavic person  I didn t feel represented enough in  the witcher . sure got a lot of black characters in a story  based on slavic and european folklore....
guess ill just cancel my netflix no pint in having it any more
season 1 was great  season 2 was just ok 3 wont be any better and 4 will be bad enough for netflix to cancel after 4 s numbers tank.
cavil was the only good thing about witcher tv show. I also didn t even bother to look up season 2. here in poland the witcher books became incredibly popular because the world was heavily based on polish eastern european culture  history etc. that usually wasn t represented in fantasy  occasional transylvania here and there but usually only as a name to reference vampires   the games also had this. it was in atmosphere  writing  characters  language  etc. and the show has nothing of it. its just a cash grab attempt to milk game of thrones audience. the world in the show is some generic medieval setting with token ethnicities forced randomly here nad there.regressives love to cry about  cultural appropriation   but this show isn t even that. its cultural replacement.
well by by witcher
yes it is good! this is the best outcome. the shitshow that is netflix s the witcher dies  cavill doesnt lose his credibility as a fan of the source material  although taking part in 2 of 3 seasons that had been rewritten dents it  and he returns as superman. winwinwin.plus  Im sick of this..  this narrative that henry cavill was somehow steering this to be closer to the source when the evidence is right there in season 2 that that didnt happen and wont in season 3! I feel like Im taking crazy pills here!!
these companies are idiots. if anybody at netflix honestly thinks anybody will watch the show with liam hemsworth they re actually crazy. now I have to not watch this show like I refuse to watch rings of power.
Im also hoping that  modern reimagining  means updating the game with modern technology. the woke plague isn t as bad in poland as it is in the us  but it is there  so time will tell......
liam hemsworth will be fine as geralt. he s good at playing second fiddle to female main characters like katniss and miley.
plus henry hulked up hard core he doesnt even fit the source material anymore
I guess the witcher games and show will have to go broke and die before we get them back... smh
I d give season 4 a chance with a 2-3 episodes. if he doesnt deliver  then the witcher series  for me  is over.
this show helped me cancel my netflix sub.
I think this confirms season 3 will be trash  the showrunners seem to want to make up their own story  pretty sad this show had great potential
as long the witcher remake launch ain t like cyberpunk then Im confident
kids always think they are smarter than their parents.
cdpr didn t just announce office changes  they announced that they are implementing esg in their offices as well as in video game development. cdrp even released an esg explanation video detailing how they plan to use socialist identity politics into their games as a driving factor in those games.this all but guarantees that the  modern audience  remake of the witcher will be heavily impacted by esg propaganda.
the rock saved cavill superman
he should have bailed mid season 2 when it became apparent that the writers hated the games and lore and were actively trying to destroy it with woke ideology and some twisted offshoot of girlpower feminism. I was surprised he stayed for season 3.
Im sorry  but I honestly dont care. Im just happy to see cavill back as superman.
r.i.p.
season 2 was basically the rings of power for the witcher franchise. most people dont realize that  because all they know are games  not the books. cavill  on the other hand  is a hardcore fan and I cant blame him for quitting. I wouldn t want to contribute to this worthless adaptation if I was him.
replacing the man of steal with the guy that got dumped by miley cyrus   dont exactly seem like a upgrade  .
they re not remaking it to be walk-through simply saying modern meaning the games going to have modern graphics looking like the witcher three if not better.
season 2 is pretty much dogshit .. but there is one shining light in it and thats the 1st episode which can be watched as a one off ... the 2 main actors are a joy to watch
I do not see this going well. if I could choose an actor to replace henry as geralt then based on looks alone I d choose anson mount. but he s tied up  in star trek now so that was never going to happen. I just cant see liam in the role. he best start hitting the gym.
for me personally  netflix witcher was dead after season 2 due to those hack writers who think they re better than the original author  cavill basically the only good thing in it   so  not really a bad news  I wont watch season 3 anyway.
it ll do one more season after henry cavill leaves then it will be canceled
sad to see how disrespectful people can be. I think henry was awesome as geralt but saying that the shows only worth it with henry is kinda disrespectful and mean.
come on  did you play witcher 1 I played witcher 3 and read the books and loved them. then I tried to play witcher 1  and couldn t enjoy it. there were many reasons  but the portrayal of female characters was a big part of it.witcher 1 was famous because you could go around conquering some ladies  and you d even get nice collectible cards for each lay.some more understanding of social issues is exactly what the game needs. witcher 3 s world is still the same world  grizzly and dark and horrible things happen  but witcher 3 does a great job at exploring prejudice and injustice in a deep manner  while still allowing adult wish fulfillment for players in a non-awkward way.
thanks for watching I really appreciate  message me by the name above to receive gifts .
the dreaded words nooooo not again
I haven t watched  but regardless of show quality  superman pays more.
he and joey batey  jaskier  were the only bright spots of the show.   yennefier was trashed by the writers  same with cirI   tris.
Imean  season 2 was kind of anti-climactic imo. so I dont blame him for leaving. I cant imagine season 3 will be any good. liam is an awful casting choice. I like him as an actor  but hes not a good choice for geralt.
the people behind the series actually made fun of the source material  I guess Im not surprised considering they re nothing but ungrateful  creatively bankrupt  talentless hacks.
so the only reason I watched the show is going to leave it
am I the only one who thought the witcher episodes were really good  I dont know anything about reviews but I really enjoyed it
witcher fans
glad henry is leaving the witcher since itseemed he was the only one who cared about the source material. as for this new game  idk what to think of their comments but after they got cucked with cyberpunk plus their bad business practices for that game  its up in the air.
jfc  cdpr is not going to remake witcher 1 to be woke. they literally mean they re going to make it a modern game. the og witcher game is pretty clunky  and I doubt the average fan of tw3 who didn t play the prior games would go back and play through that game. its a warranted remake that could use a modern re-imagining in that the game needs to be remade with modern gaming conventions.
if you have yet to cancel your netflix subscription. now is the time.
9 03 we shouldn t be afraid. they said the remake will be done by a studio run by people who worked on witcher 1 and 2. when they say modern reimagining they mean focusing more on very old gameplay and graphics than politics. also  witcher is a super liberal book so I dont think they can fuck it up.
thanks!
this is actually great news for witcher fans because this insult of a tv show will hopefully get cancelled and stop desecrating the witcher s legacy
I will be shocked if any game cdpr produces after cp2077 is any good at all. this is not the same company that made the first three witchers anymore. I am expecting complete failures on every level with every single game they make. some companies are just dead  and I put cdpr and naughty dog in thatsame category of  beyond redemption . you can cure a sick puppy  but you cant bring a dog s maggot infested mangled corpse back to life.
atlas shrugged.
hmm  there are other witchers  so no reason to replace geralt. let liam take another role. sad about henry leaving. he looks great as superman  but that is an overpowered super hero I could be without. I will miss this version of geralt!
henry cavill or not. but the major concern for is the writers. they are not fan of the game and the books from sapkowski...
the hemsworth brothers are both part of the hollywood crowd. hemsworth has no problems taking an iconic strong male character and making a goofy joke out of it just like his brother did to thor. chris hemsworth s thor is basically jeff spicolI from fast times at ridgemont high. the witcher series is done. it never was a good series faithful to the source material. now with cavill out of the picture it will be a hundred times worse.
modern reimagining of the first game is in this context very good  it doesnt mean that the game will be woke  it means that the game is going to be developed for the current gaming style. original game is very outdated with controls and rpg elements  and it was their first  dip  into the game development  it aged poorly and its very difficult to get into for newcommers. Im a fan  and have huge gaming experiance but this first game was always very difficult for me to enjoy 100 . quite simmilar to the first mass effect - excellent story but very clunky  fortunately they ve fixed that one with remasters.
yes you are
I watched the ending. you basicly said the same.
thank you so much
lol melo u kept saying liam instead of chris
on the topic of games  I gotta admit  Im tired of re-imagining and reboots like that. just remaster the game so it looks better in hd. I dont need new reimagining of anything  let us play the classics or leave em be
at this modern reimagined is a bad word
I definitely wont watch it  you cant change the main character halfway through a series.they should either cancel it after season 3 or shelve it to a much later date and try to get cavill back.
I continued to watch the awful witcher show just because of henry cavill but now that he s left Imight drop this show entirely.  hearing about the  witcher 1 remake is awesome news  if there s a game in that franchise that needs a complete re-do with a modern engine and visuals then it is this one
who s going to tell anna tswg
cdpr did not say modern audience but the mechanics of the first witcher game is horribly outdated gameplay wise.if they do a straight up remake and the story is unchanged then this could be really good because the first witcher game has not aged well.
oh well  according to one creator they hate this lore  the original one  so another title for me to not to bother
not a shittin  chance I ll be watching without henry as geralt. he was born to play that role. now we get great value geralt. no thanks.
the first season was soso  but the black elves killed it and they went woker in the second season and detoriated from both the books and games....so ...... f ck it.... glad he goes for something else....
haha he got pushed out cuz he was the only fan
hearing this and that the writers dont like the book or games.... nah Im done with the witcher show.
season 4 white wolf becomes woke wolf
good for him. the whole series is going down the drain anyways.
he was a good witcher. between witcher and superman he was an awesome witcher.  but without him I wont watch it. hemsworth isn t that good if an actor in all honesty  he s lacking something definitive.
tis is absolutely wild. thI has to be about money. or he really has taken the superman money. but this I v upsetting. _jc
Im playing witcher 3 right now actually lol and he makes a very good gerald of rivia and after season 3 I will probably quit watching it
superman or witcher - not a difficult decision.
never had any problem with the series  I think its great.he left because of money  nothing else...not watching s04.
so much disappointing news for these shows and games... sounds like Im not watching playing anymore .. wanted to play the first witcher remake but itshould be made exactly like it was... not the reimagining described ... old script should stay in the game too. also superman was the best garelt.. got the voice perfect too. without him  especially with that replacement just wont be watching. btw the series got way better by season 2 lol but yeah they ruined enough characters in the show... garelt cant be played by anyone else.. he was the only one they got right. and dandelion. hope as you said it is just graphics they re talking about in the games at the end there ...sheesh
because liam is in the role not chris
please dont share that he left for superman movie as its not true  he is staring in one movie and it wouldn t of conflicted with his scheduling.
I was more upset learning that the writing team does not even like and openly mocks the witcher game and books. I like henry cavill and portrayed geralt well  but  for me its the writing team thatsets me off. why would I want to watch a series made my people who are not even passionate about the witcher
this show is doa come season 4
between superman and the witcher he s been done dirty. I feel so bad for him getting to play characters he really likes only to be fucked over by Godawful writing and showrunners directors that dont understand what people loved abut the characters.hopefully none of those previous writers from the snyderverse are involved and he can play a superman that I wouldn t live in fear of if I lived in metropolis. brad bird would be great to helm a superman movie.
this is good news for the witcher fans. the soon this show crashes and burns the sooner we can forget about the abomination. Im happy anytime hollywood s bastardized versions of my favorite ips lose money and fail.
andrzej sapkowskI   andrew sapkovsky
I do not think it has anything to do with superman  he could do both  this is 100  about the witcher after season 1 going woke  it is not even about the witcher anymore. one you tuber called it a  intersectional feminists wet dream . reports henry carried around the books and would regularly object to major changes from the books by pointing to the part in the book and the woke hollywood staff would make fun of him. yes the game creators went totally woke  I heard their ceo make a speech and they are horrifically woke  it was like it was out of some kind comedy skit it was so woke.
hopefully each and every one of us and everybody else who s ever watched the show absolutely never watches it again. in fact cancel netflix  get cable again!
its been bad news for witcher fans since the end of the first season.  the show has gutted the graceful power of the original source material and absolutely destroyed the fundamental dynamics which made witcher so amazing. then we find out that the show has hired people who dislike the source material and are actively subverting the shows characters  rheir relationships and the world dynamics in favor of some bastardization of what I dont know.  itshould maybe be a prerequisite for any writer hired onto a shows writers room to like and support the source material.  the showrunner should be held responsible for not investing their authority to the standsrds set by the original story.  if not then why buy the rights foe the witcher   if its not the wiitcher then what are they doing   oh  they re cash grabbing and leveraging off the reputation of the source material that they seem to resent despite its success because they think they can do better. I wish they would to do that batter thing instead of ruining a great property for all of us who have bonded with these characters and the story and faithfully give them our money because we were promised something they have completely failed to deliver on.jerks
oh no  not another modern reimagining  we already know what this means  it means its going to be another  rings of power  woke fest that will go broke.this is very sad considering their good news in cyberpunk  all of their news of new games means nothing if they decide to make the game woke.
if liam hemsworth is taking over as the character in the witcher show and henry cavill s leaving the show is going to call it is going to fail because of liam hemsworth he s the most unpopular hemsworth brother out of the hemsworth who really hasn t had a successful acting career at all he s at everything he touches most likely will fail
I already gave up on the show after season 1  and so it can drown in sjw wokeness for all I care. Im just happy cavill is out! and back as superman. now all that is left is to cast this man as the new james bond already!
you would make a good laura.
the show wont survive without cavill playing geralt.  they should either introduce another character  still not good   or just cancel the show  better for their bottomline .  they got the wrong helmsworth to play geralt  by the way...
ok. why do studios hire writers that actively hate the product they make! ! itseems so alien to me.  hey. we want to make money on one of the most recognizable narrative adventure games in history. let s bring in people who dont understand dont like the source material. it d be like having me write a movie for sword art online. I ll do my best to ignore the prepubescent ogling scenes  the completely brain dead characters  and the complete abandonment of the world these people living in being a game by removing all game-esq aspects of it but then you wouldn t have a show. because I removed everything I didn t like from the show  I removed the show from what Im making.
doggos!doggos  doggos  doggos!!!
dang. thatseries is fucked now. okay  it was already fucked  but now its open season.
the witcher could have been the new game of thrones  but they chose wokeism and lost many potential fans
to be honest the witcher series was pretty bad  especially when compared  to the games and book. I didn t care for henry playing geralt at all  it didn t seem natural when he was making his voice rough. henry isn t that good of an actor either  but he is a great superman and perfect for that role  so this is good news
while its probably contractual obligation that he quit the witcher due to some hush-hush contract with wb just to get back playing as supes  I can also see the reason why he would have personally quit when a Goddamn showrunner publicly admits that the writers producers fucking dont know jack about the lore or even hate the witcher lore.  the absolute last thing a superfan of the series likes to hear is the fact that the people behind the show give zero fucks for the lore and just want to use the platform to bring wokedom into it.
rip the witcher.  I canceled my netflix account when I found out they blackwashed the show.but now... with cavill gone - pretty sure the show will lose whatever viewers it has.   clearly the show has issues if cavill quits.
they chased henry out of the role with their stupid ideas. but I dont think cdpr will  modernize  the game in that way. the witcher is a beast of other era in pc gaming. its way too clunky and old school. the second part can still be playable for fans of 3. but that first game is so mouse centric that they never ported it to consoles.
cavill was the last guardian of the material. if he left then there is no reason to watch
after reading the books many many years ago        I couldn t believe a apparent super fan  was  this show           90  of the show   was bs       if you compare to the books              I now have higher respects for henry               the  showrunners did a   injustice  to    to the books. I would not  want to   be apart of this retelling    their story
adaptation scriptwriters mocking the source material like their ten-a-penny eng lit graduate selves are too good for the job. I d be interesting to hear what multi-million selling  widely adapted works they re known for creating. ... wassat  oh  they re not. none of them  how very surprising.
liam hemsworth  really
polish mythology that after the new casting for the next season never looked so polish lol .look diversity doesnt have to be in everything especially when it takes you out the world its set in . I can watch and really enjoy foreign films without white actors like the film s the raid which is one of my favourites.
that is boom boom byebye to witcher then.
season 4 is not an honest name for it.the final season of the witcher will star liam hemsworth would be much more honest.
all a person needs to do is just compile the scenes with henry cavil in them  cut out the rest and you have a watchable show. the arrogance of the writers to think that they can mock the original source material as if what they are contributing isn t total and complete garbage. imagine those losers congratulating themselves for the great writing they think they contributed while single handedly taking a series thatshould have been epic and running it into the ground. too bad the show runners dont fire them all in a an attempt to appease cavil. no doubt he tried everything. he once said he was prepared to do 7 seasons. tragic.
I am sad off this age we are living in  we have best actors in movie history but worst woke writters and producers in history they must change source material so much that eweryone will hate it.
I guess I will watch season 1 on repeat then. season 2 was absolute trash except for the geralt and cirImoments. liam hemsworth as geralt  nah  he doesnt even compare to cavill. cavill will always be the one and only live action geralt. netflix has gone so far downhill since their height of success. the only thing keeping them afloat is stranger things. with all their failures  umbrella academy being a big one  I have a bad feeling about the upcoming season of shadow   bone and the release of the avatar the last airbender series. every single writer for netflix needs to be fired. the fact that netflix writers think think they can do better than the original writers shows just how out out of touch they are. netflix should just cancel  the witcher  now  since the only person who gives af is gone. as a woman  I dont think female showrunners should be in charge of stories written by men anymore  everything they touch turns to woke trash. the only thing hollywood is good at producing these days is nauseating levels of disappointment.
hey  twerking children are expensive  they cant float cavill and them too. come on man!
I would not worry about game reimagening. the wokeism didnt spread in poland so well like in us.
been a fan since I played the first game a lot of years ago   then read the books then came the 2nd and 3rd instalments of the game.the series was terrible  just another show about strong whamen and their perspective   hardly any monster hunting   fighting   etc. it had so little gerald in the witcher that only cavil made me was through season 1.did not even bother with season 2 as I had canceled my netflix with cuties   cavill leaving is a good thing   the writers did not like the source material and made fun of it... make a new universe then you loons   with all the whamen you wish   but since you have the creativity of a lobotomized starfish you need to ruin a existing franchise.
how to kill any franchise or new movies.have   diverse    inclusive   or  modern reimaging  in the description or promote it as such
not surprised  and dont believe for a second that its about  him being superman . its because the writers and producers for the witcher pulled the typical  extremely predictable  hollyweird shitbird move of  reimagining . henry s only stipulation for remaining as geralt was they stay as close to the lore as possible. after season 2  I knew exactly where they were taking this show. less witcher  more strong  independent  fierce  flawless  we dont need no man s!season 3 will be all about justifying yennifers bad decisions  her  taking her choice back  and watching cirilla the vampire slayer toss around dudes 3 times her size with ease while never failing at anything  ever...hey  if Im wrong  I ll come back here and meme on my own comment. but sadly  this seems like routine hollyweird predictability...
s1 was good s2 not so much glad he s escaping it before it burns
witcher was crap when season 2  started and watch it most of on x2  I have forgotten it already a real shame but must be done and Im glad cavill has jumped the boat on this.
even ignoring the fact that they said the words of doom  witcher doesnt need a fkin remake. please stop remaking old stuff ffs
he ll go to some other nerdy trendy kiddy comic book franchise.
I think youre assuming a bit too much from the phrase  modern reimagining  that doesnt imply wokeness to me  they re just talking about how the remake will be modernized to current standards of gaming. the first witcher game is basically unplayable with how outdated the controls were. I doubt cdprojekt would fuck up their franchise  all of their games have been extremely faithful to the source material.
how do you tank a game company....do this... the remake of w3 is going woak too...
Im glad henry saw the writing on the wall  but also sad that he s not playing geralt because of how passionate he was maybe in like 5 or 10 years when all this wokeism crap is over he ll get another chance at it and be able to do the story justice  but at this point I cant really fault him.
I honestly think witcher 2 was better than 3  as far as a tight narrative game  with less exploration.
he was the only good thing in it.. nothing else matched
we know how much you ladies love the hemsworth s brothers  Im sure the witcher will be just fine
ppl are going to spit chips.    again  it will make ppl angrey @ his superman too. _jc
gotta respectfully disagree on the cdpr aspect because any company that adopts esg standards that decide which  social or environmental  politics are to decide how their games should be made aren t something I d ever support.
cdpr isn t satisfied merely cyberpunking video games anymore  now they have to cyberpunk even our favorite shows... well  maybe not our favorite  but our shows. as to cavill  best of luck to him in the woke dumpster fire that is comic book movies these days. the rock coming out and playing pretend is just him being an actor  which is what actors do  act. the truth of the matter can be expressed in the first 5 minutes of their new black adam movie which is a scene fully featuring a brown child lecturing white men about how they are evil colonialist invaders exploiting their resources. I have no hopes for the future of hollywood.
the woker
a modern reimagining . as if it wasn t already way too geared toward a liberal audience. henry has been dying to leave probably since early in the first season.
damn!
I just dont understand this trend of hating the thing you ve created. it never used to be like this. its the same with 343I and halo. I guess being woke makes you hate everything  even yourself.
season 1 was fine. cirI in books is a 14 years old though. that was the biggest miscast. season 2 was pure abomination. changing source material can be ok if you create something better or something that makes sense. sadly  employing writers who openly hate the job. what can go wrong  right  executives truly are to be blamed. would I employ a person that hates the job and will boycott it from day one
there goes the only reason I was watching.      guess they want to go broke.
its actually good news. the witcher tv series was an abomination and a mockery of the source material. it would have been great to have a studio and writers who actually cared and wanted to bring the world of the witcher to another form of media but they did the typical hollywood thing and changed the world  characters and story to suit their whims and fantasies. henry cavill is better off not remaining part of this joke of a tv show.
hello. here s a tip for you about witcher  creator name   annjeey sub-kowsky. try that. greetings from poland.
unpopular opinion  witcher 1 was the last good  thrilling  maturely written game from cdpr   traditionally  not playable before a literal re-release like amount of code fixing patches .lol! cdpr s about to remake their great first game earlier than crytek remastered their great first crysis! and look how well it went for crytek - and crysis 1 fans  like me  along that trilogy ride into mass market  young boys and consoles  sorry but true . thats the downward spiral into utter gameplay design boredom  leaving only cutscenes clicking and shootie shootie dumb npcs in a boring but beautiful  open-world  - not only in cdpr s case solely kept alive by capable modders and those ever-thirsty boys.hey melonie  do yourecognize some patterns in  modern  tomb raider games    unfunny fact  excellent art creators cost nothing compared to professional software engineers and professional dedicated software testers  which are unfortunately elementarily needed to implement working advanced gameplay features like free-to-roam widely interactive open-worlds  freedom of role-playing beyond character creation  joinable dynamic factions  persistant consequences of choices not only manifested in a missing added dialog option in two or three quests elsewhere and one to three different ending cutscenes  selected by and-masking an 8 bits flags variable in a simple enough script every  coder  can come up with - in an emergency also possible by comparing it as an integer with a few dozens constants  p .
--liam hemsworth is going to look like an anorexic geralt compared to henry cavill.-- modern take on the witcher  sounds like they will do something like buffy the vampire slayer  but they will do the current trending crap and gender swap geralt and the rest of the male cast and then make geralt a gay female names geralina.
it will never be over.
liam s face just ...no.c mon....
@00 35 liam hemsworth  the man who will always be second to get there. and  agreed  they are clearly going in a direction far from the book and henry is not happy. season 2 was already doing this even more than season 1. I have a feeling that henry fell for the bait and switch just as we all have with this neo-marxist hollywood bs...
it wasn t the witcher show anyway.
liam hemsworth isn t half as attractive as henry cavill and doesnt fit for geralt. unfortunately for liam  he bears a strong resemblance to his brother chris and  to me  he ll just look like a discount thor rather than geralt.
reimagining means inclusive. there will be alot of black and asian characters  at least one main character is going to be gay  and a trans person will be involved. missions will be about stopping a cow farmer because his cows are burping too much and contributing to climate change. or taking out racists for calling a character a slur.
cant they ditch the writers and keep cavill  bet they were trying to woke up the witcher like the recent marvel stuff and cavill said nah Im out.
my argument is stop remaking games that dont need to be remade. I ll give you an example  silent hill 2. I bought the ps2 game last winter and replayed it  for sept 2001 itstill looks amazing. let s remake it  why  because its most popular. silent hill from ps1 is the one needing remade  all its 32 bit 3d polygonal glory is simply not appealing to the eye after ps2  gamecube came out. konamI understood this when they remade resident evil and metal gear solid from ps1 to nintendo gamecube  resident evil remake is the best re game to this day. the atmosphere in that game is amazing. however  silent hill 1 is the best horror game ever  it doesnt get the credit it deserves because sh2 overshadowed it. but I recently replayed them  sh2 is just fine  its sh1 needing a remake.
instead of kicking lauren schmidt hissrich out.... henry is leaving . . . . after season 3 I quit . . . .
some of the writers making fun of the source material ah  maybe thats because they know they ll never create something as impactful as the witcher book series. creating a cheap imitation of a vastly superior work.
how is this bad news for witcher fans   the show was a disgrace to the witcher lore. its akin to  rings of power  to fans of the Lord of the rings. its a slap in the face and a middle-finger to fans. having it end would be mercy. having henry cavil leave just sends a message that we  the fans  will not support this travesty   destruction of the lore we love   respect. henry cavil has integrity. after season 2  I swore off season 3. henry cavil being in season 3 will  not get me to watch it. the damage was done and Im done.
he dont even look loke gerhalt lol how is he gonna do it justice lol. also look dapper as usual melanie.
ouch  another potentially decent netflix show is about to turn into shit and hit the fan.that new guy thats going to substitute cavill has nothing even closely similar to the geralt looks. cavill just needed to grow a beard and he d have been decently close.
this is old news. like months ago.
yeah....s3 will be the end for me. I choked down the woke horseshit that came along with s1 and 2  ex  basically everything out of yennifer s mouth  because of how much I liked cavill in the role. Im not going to bother with spinoff cartoon either. time to toss this franchise on the woke-murdered corpse-pile with star wars  lotr  dr. who  star trek  etc  etc. woke is why we cant have nice things.
another stunning win for the herd that will feed on absolutely anything. they must be so proud.henry fought to give us the witcher. but the brave childish herd that will feed on anything and the woke activists won  again .
the show is dead without him
my guess is that henry quit because the writers turned the show into yet another feminist bastion of mary sue men hating cabal
you are such a beautiful woman.
the show was crap especially for someone who s from poland. showrunners have shown a total disrespect for the books and slavic culture in general. apparently season 3 is even more disrespectful so I ll be just speedwatching it  just like season 2 to see what kind of crap they made up this time. as for the remake  I understood it that they meant the game s outdated mechanics plus going woke is the last thing I would think when talking about cdpr but one cant be sure of anything these days.
I ll be honest  the witcher show was a watchable garbage  not actually a witcher  show  saved only by cavill making itso. now the show is really dead  as if the lore contradictions in the first season was not enough to leave it near dead. I also dropped the whole thing after the first season and went back to the games and books instead.
well Im done with the show....that really pisses me off
if it means more superman Im good. henry and anya s yennefer were barely carrying the show.
so thor is becoming superman
yeah.Im pretty sure he s picking superman over the witcher.it may or may not have to do with how the show was being handled.we ll never know for sure.one thing I do know is I wont be watching anything starring henry cavill from now on.I just like actors who have a least a glimmer of a moral compass.I dont believe henry has one.at least loyalty isn t one of them.God have mercy on any woman he gets in a relationship with because he s all about the  better deal .seems like he has a cheating nature about him.
modern reimagining...so geralt will start wearing skinny jeans and drink latte  dandelion will be gay and cirI is going to find herself overwhelmed in the patriarchal world and will go on crusade for women s rights sounds cool to me.
henry cavill is garlet
honestly I am kind of relieved that henry cavill left the show the way it was going but I would pick his witcher over superman anyday...not a big fan of zack snyder and although I only watched the witcher series because of him
good for him. thatshow wasn t the witcher.
I dont want to see anything in real life.       I just want you to tell me about it.   im serious
the witcher 3 the wild hunt is perfect the way it is
I liked the first season  I couldn t get through the second season. they should just end it. go out while its popular  not while its dying.
I wonder what show does she likes because every show or game she has mention she either its boring or it not good to her only positive she kinda gives is tomber raider game maybe somebody in the comments that probably more things she likes because I dont
noooooooo!!!
nooooo!!!!
bad news for netflix witcher fans.there  fixed it.
goodbye show
netflix is now a dead streaming service. why use the words  modern reimagining  if they could easily say  update . after cyberpunk  cdpr is gonna cave   tank their own remake.
good for him.bad for the show.
now start making up story they say and add woke and we get the season 4 series finale
rest in peace netflix the witcher. I will not watch the witcher on netflix without henry cavill in it. I am not a fan of liam hemsworth.
hell no. henry carried by himself nobody is watching for notyennefer and the person playing her. season 2 s rating is evidence thatshe has no pull.
absolutely no reason to watch this show anymore . sad   but he did the right thing  let it crash and burn
go woke go broke if cd project red goes woke too I wont be buying the games
they need to have jason momoa to replace henry  c  that would be awesome
its gonna be another female empowerment show by season 4 mark my words and then its gonna flop which is what always happens.  its already been heading in that direction  geralt has been getting less and less important in his own show.  by season 4 they re gonna want cirI or one of the sorceresses to carry the show now that cavill is gone and I doubt its gonna work.
modern remake  adaptation  and  modern audience  are pure cancer to any franchise.
I hope modern reimagining means the tech.  they re polish.  they generally dont do wokism there. although there is a vancouver office soooo....  fuck     -geralt of rivia
tumblr re-imagining
idk. this sounds like he had enough or something. Imean  everyone knows cavill loves the witcher mythos  but that cant be said about the rest of the netflix production crew.
henry is my favorite. wow  I will not watch witcher now seriously. henry is just a nice all around guy. a gamer   a lure guy  down to earth . ill support henry. they are destroying movies and shows for the last 10 years. I watched it because of henry. I dont care who they put in his place  not going to work. we wont talk about woke got knock off or the lotr knock off that have strayed wayyyy far away to make themselves happy and push agendas and narratives. wokeism
cpdr is now dead to me.
tomb raider is your favorite franchise ! no way !
nutflix   lol.
andthere goes another good show in the trash. if the writers didnt like it then maybe they shouldnt be working on it in the first place.
damn it netflix  you can f ck up a wet dream!! first they stop the punisher and now this  I know they are going to make 1 more season and it is going to suck and they will cancel it. they got to stick with making original movies and not tv series.
whelp  guess Im not watching any new witcher shows.
@melonie mac go boom
im hoping that the God of war show rumors stay rumors I do not want them turning my fav character and games in to woke trash
last season was a mess  a ton of filler with verry little pay back.
cavill hemsworth as geralt  depp mikkelsen as grindelwald  hod       rop
welp I refuse to watch the series after season 3. what this tells me is someone has botched the writing.
cd projekt red made a mistake with cyberpunk 2077. they are about to make another mistake by woking the witcher.
oh well  so dies another show.
might as well be liam neeson......
7 25 as a pole I would gladly help you with your pronunciation of andrzej sapkowski. nice try though
the witcher even old
frankly I have no horse in the race for the witcher.. know little about the lore  played a little of the fiest game and watched s1 bit eeeeeh
on twitter I pointed out that triss character was all wrong and I got backlash on how I am a racist because she is not white... like I never brought her skin color up at all... just that her character is not right. did this tweet ages ago... wish I could copy paste it here but yeah... usual reaction  criticism call me racist when I never said anything about race...
sounds like the witcher ip is next to die.
yeah liam hemsworth is too young  and too pretty to be a good geralt. just not gonna be the same.. like logan is to hugh jackman  geralt is to henry cavill.
might as well end the show without him most people wont watch
guess I wont be watching that again.
did this chick just compared herself to laura croft  lol
when they lose their biggest draw in henry cavill  its going to be bad for netflix when the viewership goes down.
with henry cavil leaving the show  it will hurt season 3 and tank season 4. the remake will be a disaster  let s not kid ourselves here  they will ruin the first game
oohhh fuuuuucccckkkkk  I didn t see that  modern reimagining   stuff about the remake....it weird living in a time in which you feel dread instead of joy when they announce anything about the franchises you like...
well thatshow is dead now rip witcher
what nobody is talking is that henry is announcing this before season 3 is live  that only means that is going to be shit  and hemsworth..... he is not that big of an actor for a role like this.
he quit the witcher because it isn t good. he respects the lore and characters too much to be part of it.
so that means the end for netflix s witcher.  no one is going to watch it without him.  joey batey can not carry the show because he is not the main character  even though he is good enough to carry a show  just not this one. so thatsuck.
when I hear  modern reimagining  all I hear is soooo geralt is gay now
hit meup thanks for watching
young  I agree. if by pretty you mean soft  then I also agree. liam aesthetically is a cw hire  not at all fit to fill cavill s boots.
I really like you sorry if I shouldnt
show will be cancelled after 4th season
just as well   the show wasn t good enough for him.             and I dont like people named  liam .
then I wont watch it anymore  good for him
when do u think u will b live on twitch again
I bet season 3 sucks. cavil probably didn t like the writing and why he is wanting to dip
wow. he was great on there. after season 2 my opinion of the product went way into the dirt but now this is the cherry on the top. dead show.
its actually good he is out. please let this show die with what dignity it has left now.
lol of course they fired him he was in the way of their modern view of the witcher. another netflix show thats gonna end canceled
well without henry I dont give a fuck about the witcher show anymore
esg was the cause
well netflix can write season 3 off as an l already . what are they thinking  most women I know who like the witcher franchise and myself personally dont like the crap they re writing soooo who are they writing this for
the show was only moderate anyway  compared to the games.
shit guess im done with the witcher. thatsucks
season two was so boring I couldn t even stay awake
him quitting means its dead we only put up with the writers and show runners woke shit because of henry ... and if he quit a character he loves then its bad ... im betting season 3 is a total dumpsterfire   and hemsworth cant frigging act
the witcher season 3 must be an absolute shitshow if cavill is out.
it ll be interesting how much cash the modern audience shells out for this. I played the original 3 times when it came out  thats enough for me. just make something new.
all my fave ish sci-fifantasticalcomic book stuff..is all getting woke fukked.
sorry for the simp comment but you look stunning
he was amazing witcher f hollywood
I wont be playing the next witcher game.
modern reimagine doesnt necessarily mean wokeism or anything political. ethics are very different between gaming companies and hollywood movies. these two arent the same nor follows the same rules. in the terms of sales only a foolish gaming company would follow a cultural doctrine when knowingly it ll plumet their reputation and sales. im certain most gaming companies have payed attention to blizzards failoure at it. modern reimagine likely means new mechanic method they can use for the older witcher games which wasnt possible back then. keep in mind the game is about 10 years old if not older. so yes modern reimagine is the proper world in the terms of how far tech has evolved.
no chance im watching after he leaves lol. just cancel it now.
no  this is great news  because the abomination netflix has had dancing about in the witcher s flayed skin will be put out if its  and our  misery.
this is good.  he was the only reason consoomers participated in yet another piece of cultural vandalism.  glad he left to go play as superman.
welp  I guess I wont be watching that anymore
henry was a fan of he source materials including the games  they ruined the witcher with their casting  and without henry I have no interest.
modern reimagining for who  the 1  of the population that is offended by everything.
I will not be watching but its not an indictment of hemsworth as an actor. I think he s a decent actor and a classy dude. netflix is just trash.
wait!  you like tomb raider
this is great news!henry doesnt want to be apart of that trash anymore. he was super happy before season 1 promoting etc... he believed they would be stick to lore as much as possible. but they didnt they ruined season 1 as alot of it was not lore accurate.you can see he didn t put much effort into season 2 and hes not even talking about season 3.he loves the storys but hates that they are destroying it.season 2 was just trash season 3 will not get better so we will see if theres even a season 4.but its not even worth watching without henry.and stuiped audible is changing all the covers on the witcher books and a netflix series sticker on them. now that pissed me off. they shouldn t have done that. that garbage of a show has nothing to do with the books and shouldn t even be compared. the netflix series is fan fiction trash.
first season was awesome  second season was crap. second season was a completely different tone than the first and it just didn t work
I couldn t even finish the las season. the show is dead to me.
cd pojectred joined the  esg and said  diversity and inclusion is our core going forward so fans have a right to be concerned with games like this with statements like that I want to have hope but the esg is responsible for the trash woke political crap we see in all our games today its still to early to say but this doesnt give me much hope
I wish they would stop with the  modem reimagining  of period time pieces set in fantasy worlds. its so pretentious and ridiculous to think they need to fix these works of art.
everyone  can you just go back to making coherent and impactful storylines  well pay you..hollywood  best I can do is some mediocre reboots riddled with overt wokeness  and swap the genders on everyone. well make you cringe at every showing.  oh  and make you pay a subscription to see it.
nice dogs
reimagining is one thing. promising to follow the source material only to bait and switch is just a shitty thing to do.
yeah  esg.they re not talking about better graphics and better gameplay.they re talking about virtue-signalling  esg   and trying to attract investors.
great  now this will be ruined. the only reason most people watch was because of henry cavill.
good thing he went away because the show will end in no time
hey I dont like the new witcher actor too bad cavil isnt there anymore  now I dont  know if im interest in the new show most likely not.
what s a big deal here  this show is so bad from beginning and have nothing to do with books yet now everyone is mad because they will recast geralt  cavil was not a good choice from the beginning. I get this he is a big fan  handsome guy because of everyone now thinks  being nerd is cool  but think about working with this guy who notoriously admonish his own boss and hinders production. he even not directly insult series by seeing he wanted more from books. netflix had enough of him and wanted to get rid of dude.
well thatshow s now dead to me.
Im sure all the holes will scream for a browneye to replace n dress up in blonde wigs with contact lenses in
but he was the only really good part about the show! so dumb  why would they do this
how do you make a modern version of a game while calling it reimagining of the original material. its not a remake its not a modern version of the game its a new game using references from the original.
I hope yen and cirI and jaskir actors quit as well.
I sure hope they dont turn the witcher into a fruitboy
1st  they fk up dr. who   now this fkin bs... he was the one person who was believable in the role...
netflix begging people to subscribe again. then ruins people s shows. wont be watching it without henry
the worst thing is the both sided  boot licking  of both actors  that at this point I cant take serious anymore. just pr nonsense...as for a modern reim.... not going to say it!!! no! ...may very well lead to modern bankruptcy. just sayin
well the shows done now. no point in watching anymore.
I refuse to watch witcher without witcher in it. and real witcher will always be henry cavil. there will be no one like him even with shitty writings  he shine through darkness like great white wolf.
5 38 did she say f  @ face
this is not good for henry s career. that industry will take notice.
netflix should just go ahead and cancel the witcher. henry carried the show on his back! without him the witcher completely falls apart
these woke writers are going to make him part of the alphabet community. no thx!
you dont actually like the witcher though  melonie.
I said  puppies
it really is just a matter of time that most games will be ruined with woke nonsense.
wp
I only watched a couple of episodes   really didn t like it!   but that lump of wood hemsworth will kill of the show entirely....
bah I wont watch it.  I liked henry but I respect his decision.
well  I wont be watching any more witcher.
so... cdpr fails quite hard with cyberpunk 2077  and their reaction to that is to remake an old game. did all their creativity and passion just vanish after making witcher iiI  wtf.
he was to good for this shitshow
Im glad he left witcher  I wouldn t want his career to be tainted by the woke tv series.
season 2 was not good. season 1 was good not great.
the writing for the show was pretty bad  Im not surprised in the least.
thor as geralt will suuuuuck.
aaaand poof. all my interest in the show is gone.
I want to see patty jenkins direct a henry cavill superman movie. no more zack snyder. I dont want snyder to come back to direct.
nooo... netflix sux we want cavil
the show is done.
its good news   this shite wasn t sopose to be made if they are bothcing it that bad. I played the games first and then the books.
if you ever hear the words  modern audience   run  run very far away very fast. dont waste your time. dont waste your money. just. fucking. run.
yeah no.  no cavil  no watchy watchy
I dont like recasting. most likely wont watch after season 3.
cavil is constantly in things thatsuck but does a good job anyway. his superman movies sucked ass but he was great as superman.
let this be a lesson to all ip holders.  never sell 100  rights to anyone  and always reserve the right to revoke the license w  no refunds.you can park this in the same garbage dumpster fire as rings of power.
they might as well just end it all now  I was a huge fan and Im not even going to watch season 3. hemsworth is a horrible actor  chris is the only one of them that can act at all and he s not even that good.
well  farewell netflix s witcher. Im out.
hemsworth will do a terrible job. what a joke of a show now.
actually it is awesome!!! thanks God henry will not continue to participate in this shitshow. btw I watched series because of him
the modern re-imagining will   the last of us 2  utter tripe.
I know alot about the witcher and seriously henry was the only thing that made me watch that garbage. he was really close to a geralt we could have. the monsters  their behavior  the story  the relations between nation. the other characters are all butchered  some even worst then other. eskel was a big wtf did you do to this character!!! vezimir trying to turn cirI  the leshen etc. nothing was faithful to the book and video game  only henry.
4th season of the witcher  I didn t even know there was a 3rd. thatshowed started kind of meh  and went severely downhill in season 2. is anyone still watching it
sorry but it really doesnt matter canceled netflix 2 months ago
get ready for transexual geralt.
people in hollywood dont read
this show is fucked
Im not watching it. the show was built off of henry cavill  not liam.
henry cavill was literally the only good thing about this show.  Im glad he s leaving even though I love him as geralt  he deserves much better than the shitsandwiches the writers of this show are serving up.
let s just hope they dont make geralt gay bI trans...
its a trash sub cw show without him. the writers hate the books and the game. rip show.
show wasn t focused on geralt enough.  too much  yennifer  too much ciri.  season 1 bearable despite the stupid timejumps in story telling.  season 2 was a dumpster fire.
I couldn t even finish the first season  boring and predictable tbh.
I wish they replaced cavill with viola davis. peak clown world
netflix already blackwashed the witcher series.  I couldn t finish season 2.  I wasn t going to watch season 3.  glad cavill is out.
I dont know why he would pick superman over the witcher.the dceu threw him away and has actively been trying to replace him for a black actor for years.at least the witcher crew wanted him there
the witcher sucks! I couldn t even finish watching the first episode thats how bad it is! he is making the right choice here! its time he dedicates his talent to smth of actual worth!
dont feel any problems with that. let that awful series go in flames!
thats it this serie is over!!what a waste of potential....
meh show kinda bombed in season two. maybe now it will die bc cavil was hard carrying. as for the remake I will sit out the  modern reimagining  we just want the game with better graphics...
oh no!!! I actually liked the witcher  it was fun and funny. if henry cavil quit then its over. show is dead. you cant replace superman.
this is good news for witcher fans because the netflix garbage was not good and Im glad henry is no longer associated with it.
whelp  another show Im no going to watch.
if cavill is out  Im out. not a fan of hemsworth.
great news!!! he was an awful witcher!!
the witcher show sucked because they cheeped out on it-hired the cheapest bus bench developerthe cheapest absolutely the cheapest costume designer..everything cheap Imean they picked up some of these guys at the flea market!
looks like season 3 will be where I leave it  too. another ip ruined by idiots who think they know better than someone who sold enough books to get this kind of attention.
the new witcher game will be woke trash just wait.
I had enouth in the second season. this was not witcher anymore just some netflix bullshit.
hemsworth is too soft and pretty to be the witcher. horrible casting!
loved cavill  hated the show.
be nice if you could put on a t-shirt once in awhile  guy or girl its just a sloppy look
liam is a horrible choice for the witcher
the tattoos were a bad choice and you know it. quit doubling down.
and by the way  look at the original actor micha   ebrowskI  playing witcher in a rather bad polish series of the same theme in 2001 2002  worse than netflix  but not woke yet  - that was even before the games.
henry was the only reason I tuned into the otherwise nonsensical show.I was expecting monster hunting  romancing  and gwent  but all we got was girl power and characters that were race gender swapped. begone!
liam  pffft... not keen he is gay
yeah  im done watching it!! an I will not watch liam hemsworth s  he is not the witcher!!
I only watched the first season and didn t like it. the first season wasn t even about the witcher. geralt and the bard guy were the only enjoyable part about it  and they were underused. it was basically the yennefer  and thats not what I want from a witcher series.
season 2 was a total crap. no surprise he jumped ship
cdpr lost a lost of trust with me with cyberpunk 2077. witcher 1 wasn t very good so I will believe it when I see it.
how about good news  never support something that is toxic to what you believe in
I found the series to be pretty boring too. I couldn t finish season 2
show was crap  good for him !
liam hemsworth  the less charismatic hemsworth  pass
yep  this show is dead. Im sure season 5 wont happen.
the show is dead! netflix should just cancel it.
mary sue cirI ruined season 2. it was horrible.
hope the show gets canceled. its so ass. glad he left. it must ve hurt to see them butcher one of his favorite series.
I hope those arses never get ahold of robert e. howard s conan or michael moorcock s eternal hero  elric corum books. they suck.  the tv writers  not the books.
as soon as henry cavill says his out of the witcher  it means its gonna be so diverse and so woke that they gonna shove their fucking message in us. so fuck witcher 3.
modern reimagining  just means race-swapping a bunch of characters and shoehorning in woke ideology.
he seems to be a quitter  first he quit justice league for mission impossible  then superman for the witcher and now his dumping the witcher. unreliable.
this is dumb. they should have just waited until cavill was available. there is no continuity here. dumb...
he was the only good part of the show anyway and dandelion but the show was garbage from the beginning
Im not watching  liam hems.. ugh
dont care about witcher at all. let s hope that they dont wokefy the upcoming cyberpunk s dlc.
fuuuuuuck!!!
if the remake has one raceeswap or gender bs Im out
series 1 was amazing. series 2 was a steaming pile of garbage. I guess series 3 will not be much better if it made him quit.
I ll be honest  I hated cavill as geralt. thought he was all wrong for the part. then again  I dont think much of him as an actor so there s that.
might as well cancel the series.
ding dong! the witcher is dead!I felt sad when I heard the news. henry was the reason my wife and I watched this series even with its flaws. art being sacrificed for quick money needs to end
what is it with all these producers story writers at these companies not like the source material   gtfo  go do something else you waste of space.
cant wait to see triss as a black character in witcher remake.  woke
honestly  the witcher series was dead since the day it day viewed on netflix.  its a bad adaptation from a great source  and the second proves it more so  and the direction they want to take the series  which is also bad.
wow! haha crazy hc was the only good part of the witcher. lh stepping into the role is like a child try on their parents clothing. it doesnt fit.
you should work on your lighting. its too bright and makes your face look flat.
I ll never get this. why not make a witcher series about eskel or other witcher schools  they could have just leave henry as geralt and tell the story in the same world about somebody else.. this shit never worked.. it had not worked for tomb raider  will not work for blade  and will not work for this show either.. idiotic  pre-historic thinking that they can just replace the actor..
the show was cringy   as was his acting in it...
this is good news! the show was ruining the franchise by corrupting the source material and just being plain bad  bar a few scenes Im sure cavill had a hand in making. cavill was wasted in this garbage made by a feminist soap opera producer.
the witcher show was absolute dogshit.glad he has the integrity to walk away.other actors regularly destroy characters  franchises and mythos for a paycheck.and there are no witcher show fans.. only cavill fans that were watching.
modernized   they mean americanized... culturally appropriated...
stop saying henry was the reason people was watching the witcher being a fan of the witcher is the reason people was watching witcher y all be saying anything stupid and did the writers come out and say they was making fun of the show no they didn t y all internet people need to stop believing everything you hear with no proof
I am so sick of hearing and seeing  modern reimagining .if they make it a black  geraldine  that of course has to be gay so they can have less sexy versions of the same love interests with the same quality control of cyberpunk I honestly hope it crashes the company.
I wont lie  I know most witcher fans weren t fond of the netflix witcher series  but I was enjoying it. it did have some  girl power  nonsense n it which was unfortunate. but I still enjoyed a good bit of it. but if cavill is gone  I wont b watchin it. u cant replace the main guy and expect that to work for fans. sorry  not sorry. just not happening. if it were chris hemsworth maybe.. and thats a phat maybe. but liam  fuckin liam   nah  fam. just nah..
henry by and large is the main reason the vast majority of viewers ever bothered with the series. keep in mind  he s an a list celebrity and gamers only account for a small percentage of the viewing population. cavill  marketing and word of mouth is what made the show such a hit.
lets be honest the second season was literally horse shit. didn t even follow the story of the witcher   it veered off to another mary lou character forcing woke agenda girl power shit down my throat the entire time. if I wanted to be patronized for being a man I d walk at a womens march wearing an  I hate abortion shirt
no offence to liam the show is going to fail
henry cavill was the main draw of the show. witcher is dead after season 3. I ll watch season 3 to support cavill s work. then I ll stop watching. Im a long time netflix subscriber  but Im strongly considering unsubscribing after witcher season 3 and stranger things season 5. netflix has nothing interesting after those 2 seasons of shows.
no! God no! what terrible trash show will I not watch now !
sigh..... star wars  star trek  warhammer  Lord of the rings  dr who  marvel  dc  tomb raider... and now witcher.....is there nothing sacred to these woke rejects
why is a polish company accepting this crt nonsense  it doesnt even make sense for their culture at all...Im really sad for cdpr because they could have been one of the last bastions of decent entertainment in the industry but they are f-ing it up. my hope now is that the coming iron age makes up for it but its going to be a slow process.
wow what a horrible casting with liam hemsworth. I never thought I d say this but just cancel the show.
turning the witcher into a pile of shit like rings of power   he is like ye im out.
the witcher series is dead to me.  henry cavill was the only reason I watched that woke show.
liam hemsworth is a huge downgrade from henry cavill!! this stinks! henry embodied the character!
dont blame cavill after they murdered eskel in season 2 they proved what was coming was the witcher. Im done watching this crap
thats what I think to I think old henry quit because itsucks.
witcher is going to suck. I dont think im going to watch season 4. I just read an article showing that cd projekt red is caving to the  stakeholders  for esg priorities. say goodbye to good content.also  those quotes by the actors dont sound authentic. they sound a little bit like pr statements.
so  youre a huge witcher fan who is concerned about how liam will do  but then you didn t even watch the second season with the guy who you saw was the best ever  smh. why do you even act like youre such a fan  if you thought the show was boring and didn t even watch the second season  why the hell is your opinion even valid on this  lmao. what a trip
great news for witcher fans  actual witcher fans  the netflix diversity hire trainwreck is dead hooray. even the writers said they hate the books and games.
Ive just seen the trailer for the witcher blood origin.conclusion  the witcher is getting the woke treatment. the witcher is dead
if your acting and writing is being dwarfed by a game that came out 7 years ago  you should just quit.for the love of God  just stop!!!except henry... he was great.
this is good news for witcher fans since the show needs to die
the witcher 1 ok  bait and switch the witcher 2 badthe witcher 3  the witcher 4 passrunners bad  writers weak
dont know why but Ive never liked liam  he isn t likeable to me. maybe he works in certain roles but not as a heroic main character  and as geralt  hell no!
I tried I tried I tried but the witcher sucks
meh  another franchise to die. nothing new.
this is terrible news said no one with a stable mind  move on with your life.
superman doesnt need this crap
I do not sympathize with fans of this trash series. you fattened the paycheques of mediocre actors   actresses hired to tick a box rather than their skill  you handed your money willingly to ppl who actively dislike you and the witcher source just for 1 piece of eye candy who is gone now. and now not even feminism and diversity hires can save it.
henry sold out. idk why everybody wants to elevate him to sainthood. he just torpedo d a franchise he supposedly loves so he can star in a crappy generic superhero movie.
the witcher season 2 was dog shit anyways.  I knew it was too good to last.  season 1 was the only good one.
last of us gonna be shit too.
yikes. ntflx witcher   dead
he sucked as him anyway. henry is an overrated and overhyped actor anyway and he is not alone in this but this is about him.
too bad. he makes a better geralt than superman. his superman is not very convincing.
okay but why did they have to pick another beautiful white man to play the role  is there a shortage of lgbtq poc actors or something  how about amputees  or people in wheelchairs  cant they play the role just as well  I think a midget would probably be a refreshing change  since little people are underrepresented in entertainment anyway.
the show sucked
another woke trainwreck
it was shit anyway. I loved the games. the show was not good.
too bad the much of the story of the witcher is plagiarism of michael morlock.
.... and Im out. henry cavill was carrying this show. fuck all modern content.
this show is pathetic. season 1 weak and season 2 is an abomination. same level as rings of pawer. nothing from books  this is netflix s own story. cavill has repeatedly said that the show is deviating from the books.
read the books and played the games  even gwent  but the show is absolute shite  typical netflix adaption.also cavill is a terrible geralt  dont me wrong I like cavill but I just dont see his as geralt
the witcher show is now officially dead. henry cavill was what made the show worth watching. the rest of the show is mediocre at best. I wont bother watching anymore.
lol and yet you are here commenting.
@pavlov s dog  k
modern tomb raider is trash  I was a massive fan got all but the latest was so weak.
I was really distracted from your video.  youreally should use an ad-blocker on your browser.  fungal toenails... yuck.
it was a crap show  anyway.
henry cavill is so professional. anya chalotra and joey batey were great but thatshow was fucked from season 1. really they ought to just scrap the witcher at this point and give anya and joey their own show.
have you ever seen the witcher 1  first check it  play  then come back and rethink the  reimaginate .
oh good  bring in a  beta male with every facial que to show it.. guy lacks any muscularity of dynamic movement skills to show he can play the part.  might as well bring in cartoon bambI  be a more believable geralt. done with the series.
girl  the thing you dont understand about cd projekt red is  it is a polish game developer and poland as of now is not poisoned with united states  bullshit woke leftist crap  thank God . so  I am pretty calm about this remake. gladly  we dont follow your american insanity guys.
youre not very good at this....
if you are bored by the witcher then its a you problem. top 5 series currently airing. with  refreshing non-woke content. which I dont watch that trash.
lol no. nobody is watching the witcher for those two get real dude
