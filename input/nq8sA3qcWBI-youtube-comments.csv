disney  how dare georgia make a law limiting abortions! also disney  thank you china for allowing us to film mulan right outside your organ harvesting camps.
this character was pushed because the co-creator  who is currently rumored to possibly be fired for her inappropriate behavior  was also a vice president of creative design and would stand to make a lot of money if this character made the big time. fortunately  this character was not as well received as the media made itseam.
great points at the end of the video. I think one of the big differences between adults and grown up  children is caring about other s approval. I try to live by the prayer for the power over things I can control  to let go of what I cant  and for the wisdom to know the difference. thank you for being the real you. it brings much more benefit to the world than if you caved to the mob. also  you are pretty
making characters from different backgrounds and races naturally cohesive is what makes a great movie. forcing it and throwing it in the face of the viewer all the time makes it cringy as hell.
dont let hollywood touch witchblade or darkness
I grew up reading my older brothers comics. Im really tired of them changing the characters especially the powers. starfire from the teen titans was my favorite  but the changes really turned me off the the tv series.
hey melonie!  I just binged watched a few of your videos and I want to comment on the video youreleased on march 12.  towards the end  you talked about that as a Christian you should be strong.  Im somewhat a Christian as well  Im in fact am a catholic.  it can be hard to act like Jesus  its definitely a struggle for me.  Im always failing to be like him and the people on twitter and others like them dont help with that problem.  I dont know the point of this comment I wrote but your videos are really inspiring to do what s right.  I wish you the best and I cant wait to see the next video!
g4tv to be nominated for backpedal fest 2022  currently the only contender in the running.thanks for doing what you do  love watching your content on the day to day. the Bible verses are a welcome addition.
10 22 when I was a kid  and while I wasn t homeschooled  I was effectively an only child for these years and grew up more with older movies than current ones  I loved true genius  and had I watched it back then weird science would have been well up there too  I think I saw revenge of the nerds in my early teens. Im going to say that movies that danced around poverty back then and now are completely different  because I think you could argue that carrie was a movie about it too. but yea  any movie today about that awkward time of your life is just wholey appealing because of how sanitized it has to be or the people making them today are creepy as hell and lets end it there because there are people I can mention from old movies thatshould have never been able to work around kids again  but disney  I think it was them  hired them anyway.
it looks like disney is following the cw formula in the cringe category. stop playing identity politics and give us good stories with likable characters.
just tell me a story. a good story. make me feel something. make me think and wonder. stop using a character to tell people what they re supposed to think about what the  story  says about society. make escapism fun again  make me feel like I forgot the world existed while I was in the portal to the something else.
you said 90 s x-men animation and I immediately heard the theme from it. such a great throwback.
its definitely not my kind of thing. I hope that it works for the people who like the character though. btw did you actually get into the tomb raider comics when they were out  if so love to hear a review from you as a mega fan. oh and love your Bible verse of the day. it actually brightens my day so much when youread them. please continue to do so
anybody else thinks melonie calling us boomers is kinda... hardcore in a cute way   Imean every single time I picture every viewer after hearing  what s up my boomers    emitting a low  deep and guttural booooooom whether they re watching their screens or listening while doing something else  like the gow boomer ennemy does when engaged in combat. and thats just great !
refreshing to hear someone from my gen say that they prefer dc over marvel. what beats batman  for real
even if you dont make it  remember youre in the finals of our hearts  3
ms. marvel debuted in 2013 in the fallout of a marvel comic event. she has powers similar to mister fantastic  super stretch and size adjustment. with strength based on her altered size. she got her powers from exposure to an artificial element called terrigen that activated her dormant inhuman genetics. not mutant genetics  inhuman bcuz one of her bce ancestors was experimented on by kree aliens.
this is why I watch my old school movies way better !
wasn t personally familiar with the modern character of ms. marvel so I went to take a look. this version of the character was created in 2013. there are a lot of differences between her and other characters that have gone under the ms. marvel name  which is fine. looking at the power set though the powers are completely different... first off she appears to be an inhuman  which is cool  Im a black bolt fan  but her powers from the source material appear to be  healing factor  shrink enlarge body  stretching in a similar way to mr. fantastic or plastic man. decent strength ability when she makes herself bigger too but the trailer shows like... completely different powers. crazy departure.
in other dead-on-arrival news  - eric july.
mulan.... I saw the 1st scene of that movie at a review and was glad not to have to watch the rest... perfect from the get-go idealized politcal zealotry with a feminist agenda driven protagonist who s only flaw is being too perfect  coz female power... next!
case in point  the avengers game by square enix. horrible game and they made kamala khan the main character. stupid af.
@lurch685  yeah date soft lost tons of money on that game with all the glitches and the poor choice you mentioned.
but thats not even true.  making characters from different backgrounds and races naturally cohesive is what makes a great movie  it doesnt make it great it doesnt make it bad  it adds nothing it takes nothing away. the same movie doesnt get better or worse just because you add some gay or black etc. characters. it just adds arbitrary rules to the story which makes it harder to create.
that isn t what makes a great movie unless the movie itself is about different races together. otherwise it is irrelevant at best  and propaganda at worst.
this is in regards to inclusiveness. there are plenty of other factors I agree. but forcing it doesnt do anything to benefit the characters or story.
@keto3883  yeah  the whole  look  Im all for diversity and I know it is a good thing  thing that people always say is very inaccurate imo. it can not be a bad thing  but in the end the only  diversity  that is truly good is diversity of ideas...and that is something a lot of people dont like in current year.
to you
@illdee04  to me  nah. I couldn t care less about diversity or representation. it is about entertainment. being woke for the sake of being woke is not entertainment  without a very morbidly skewed sense of humor . it is being woke. can something be woke and entertaining  the deck is heavily stacked against it and completely saturating the market. try not being woke. or an actually different take on it  like creating a picture and making the mess of color with no rhyme or reason be the point. show the audience the absurdity of it all.
too late for witchblade....but the 90 s series was pretty good. was only 12 episodes I believe.
@bushinryucat  didn t have an anime that was good
thanks melonie for liking my comment the darkness games and comics inspired me to make hellborn a millatay serviceman with demonic powers
if there is a thing that fills the heart. it isn t in twitter. keep yourself out of that limbus of madness buddy.  your health will improve a lot if you just cut that out. I did.
its funny how batman gets to be a badass but characters like this must constantly bring up race  gender  etc and they have no idea why they fail its astonishing
cry some more
@t.o t.o  watch your token characters fail some more
@victor von doom  hmmm lets see which token characters have failed in the mcu. care to name them  oh u cant bc there haven t been any that have.
@t.o t.o  captain marvel is the most hated  king  lmfao  valkyrie is being laughed at online captain  diversity hire  falcon is a joke and this crap let s see what s next
the 80s   90s animated superhero shows were on a different level. they re all classic   legendary. fantastic 4  spider-man  batman  iron man  x-men  ninja turtles  ghostbusters. epic!
I heard that one off 80s one.
batman is goat!!!
yeah  Ive always liked dc over marvel too  and was also refreshed to hear that answer . but I grew up with btas  batman  the animated series  and jl jlu  justice league  too.
you mean before or after dc had batman left at the alter by catwoman
@the royal mediator  btas was the best animated superhero show growing up  bar none!
iron man would beat the batman.
@jonathan sanders  haha. realistically  Im sure it all depends on the story and prep time.
martha
@the royal mediator  then the lawyers would get involved  and both would end up living in hell s kitchen .
well its a good thing youread the wikI for us
I was totally thinking it was like green lantern with how her powers are. I dont think they can do the elastic type of powers on a disney  series budget  fox couldn t get mr fantastic correct the 4 movies they tried. at this point itseems mcu doesnt want people to read any of the comics the movies are based on  they change too much about them
turning red is both stunning and brave. man  what happened to pixar  this is the studio that brought us toy story  the incredibles  ratatouille and wall-e.
kamala s power  as manifested in the comics  would make her appear too much like mr. fantastic from the fantastic four. the way they have changed itso thatshe gets her power from that bracelet. which means its either the nega-bands   which is how the og captain marvel a kree military officer  got most of his powers or  the way the powers are presented  the quantum bands  which is how quasar a cosmic scale hero  got his powers.the 2nd one is more interesting since quasar has a few supporting characters that would be nifty to see on screen  like epoch  which is an offspring of ego and a  living planet  .
like the first two gifs you showedgood point about changing the powers. ms.marvel wasn t particularly a big character  but changing any character at their core is disappointing to the fans and dishonest to any new audience.
they gave her the crystal hard light construct powers  think green lantern  for the show because stretchy powers giant fists are hard to do in live action  they always look kinda weird .
she is 35 ! woah she looks incredible for her age. goes to show how much good exercise does for the body. but that aside  Im giving this movie a hard pass. marvel has been infected by disney s wokeness and it has never been the same since.
I really admire your ability to keep your mouth clean. its been a struggle with me for 20 years or more. since Ive been commenting and chatting in live streams Ive been trying to keep it clean here  since this is your house and I want to respect that  Ive found myself cussing less in conversation.
I totally agree with you  melonie  gina should portrait red sonia  hell  she would be an awesome xena warrior princess too!
Im glad I found this channel  I cantell youre gonna go far! bless
I thought the blue lighting was an aesthetic thing  since blue and yellow are complimentary colors. so at least your color coordination is on point thanks art school  finally the  10k  of my student debt and 4 years of my wasted life was finally put to use 15 years later in my 30s...for a youtube comment.
awesome video again melanie  love yo hear what you think about the g4 thing sounds good love the Bible quotes too
you are right malonie  you cant just change a superhero s powers and have them remain the same character. spider-man is spider-man because he has the powers of a spider. if you can just change whenever and you are nothing unique then you are really nothing. we are defined by our limitations as much by as what we are capable of.
ms. marvel was made for those zoomers that are always zooming everywhere.
I haven t really watched this next run of marvel. thatsays a lot about the current state of marvel.
what you said about pandering is so true. the example I like to give is avengers endgame vs the season 2 finale of the mandalorian.spoilers in endgame  they have that cringy scene were carol danvers gets the gauntlet and all the female heroes show up to back her up with some terrible line. in the mandalorian season 2 finale  they have an all female squad of warriors take over a starship while the main guy is off saving grogu. but they never mention it is all women  they are just badasses who are there to kick ass. and that works so much better than  what they did in endgame.
here is the problem now with a lot of superhero movies now. develop character...powers are just a side. point being tony stark was brilliant yes  but he was also arrogant and selfish in the beginning. he had a tragic moment...and it made him re-evaluate his choices and life...not changing overnight but you could see him becoming a hero...which made endgame that much sweeter as it made his culmination of hero that much greater..this is what made tony so beloved is his evolution!...wanda is also a character with flaws and pains thatshe has to overcome. steve rodgers tried to the right thing but even he made mistakes...also with most of the characters when they came out it wasn t just about ohhh look how powerful I am...no...this is why especially they are ruining female heroes....even women know thatstruggle and triumph over a flaw or obstacle is what makes that person more real and believable. like the spiderman no way home...omg..great movie...to understand choices have consequences...and doing the right thing might have sacrifices. this this is what makes movies great. lastly  these woke or new messages are the wrong messages to teach...yes diversity is important but no over skill or values a person has. just because you make a character female and make her superpower doesnt mean she is a good person with values. also  how does a person handle power...one of the best messages I still love is from spiderman.. with great power comes great responsibility!  meaning you have to watch what you do with powers and not just powers but how you are as a person!  struggles build and define a person...woke messages are just like oh the person is diverse and powerful that is enough..no no no!
meanwhile  more seriously  I suspect they changed kamala s power set for budget reasons  too. sparkly crystal effects would be a lot easier to look right  or good enough  on a tv budget than monkey d luffy powers.
the kamala bit  ive been wondering the same thing because of the timing!! and its disney so I wouldn t doubt it.
you speak nothing but truth. you are my spirit animal. stay safe and keep doing what you do
so crazy to hear someone say their first movie was t2.  mine was e.t.   now I feel old.
its disney. they got all the money. they just being cheap.
well duh  what else would you use it for
except now they d freeze out wasp and surI for being  problematic  its only girl power when they all agree.
I laugh because star wars woman are invincible.
they have changed her powers for the show. youre right about being stretchy like mr. fantastic  for this show they turned her into a green lantern-type.
as someone that is all about keeping a character true to their source material. when this ms. marvel was first introduced in the comics she wasn t very popular or known  much like negasonic teenage warhead . however after watching this trailer. I feel like this is a big improvement and its going to be way better than the original concept.also Im catching a lot of  Im blue da ba dee da ba dI  vibes from this video. and I hope once you get that g-fuel shaker there is a chance for us to purchase it. it would be cool to have a boomer shaker.
unrelated but Ive been calling the art style of turning red wallace and gromit like as well  Im glad Im not the only one seeing it that way.
thanks for cranking out content at mach speed!
love your enthusiasm  keep it up
I dont mind green lantering her stretch powers  since stretching never look good in live action  but adding the other stuff was weird. I agree we should see the show first  but to invalidate a fan is never okay. they are the ones that made it popular in the first place to be adapted.
marvel so focused on creating diverse characters. then when someone takes a closer look... yeah this sucks. we need to change it for live action.
ms marvel was originally carol danvers in the comics in the 70 s until they change it
omg...youre 35  !   my dear you are simply rocking it ! yeah I dont know anything about this particular toon  problem is that they are changing characters in multiple genres and everyone will be affected sooner or later. by the way  kinda funny how its now ok for the girls to be all lusty over a half-dressed male...wonder how the moral elite  would feel if it was a scantily clad girl that the boys were leering at. personally I could give a crap  I was a teen in the 70 s and we just had fun without having to deal with this stuff  but at least stay consistent.
I ditched twitter over a year ago but youre making me wanna come back on just to help.
yay macdrop!! your gfuel gifs are   what can we do to help    I hope you make it through to round 4!!
I dont have a problem with poc s being  the lead in movies and tv shows. what I have a problem with is when a movie or tv show wants to remind everyone the lead is poc every 5 seconds.
I tried to get my daughter into this comic book. but no go. I wonder if the show will be different. its aimed at her. we ll see.
so has melonie always been a alien shape changer or has she been replaced by one and the real melonie is tied up in the basement screaming for help
is it overly creepy that I wish I had a melonie mac body pillow
noooo way are you 35 years old    you look like and I thought you was around 18 to 20 years young. amazing. keep up the great work.
if your wondering why they changed her powers  its cause they re  for lack if a better word  goofy.embiggeningthat is the word used to describe her powers which is essentially like mr. fantastic  minus the stretching. the reason they likely changed it is cause it would look fake and cartoonish on tv with a disney  budget or grotesquely horrifying.
6 20 they changed her powers  new she is basicaly green latetn  also she was inhuman new she is not  I call it inprovement  stratchy skin was not even her original power its just her latest version  thats why many say the same about her powers   a lot of comic also said its improvment
if you want a comic accurate representation of kamala kahn as ms marvel. please play at least just the story mode of the marvel avemgers game. there s no pandering and she is almost spot on with her comic counterpart. her power is polymorphy and kate bishop  girl hawkeye  her powers are supposed to be cosmic portals and shielding. the disney marvel basically made kate a powerless person to be more like the guy hawkeye. and gave kamala kate s comic powers. its so weird
melanie  playing gamecat  photbombs -- because catmelanie   wut ! cat   gif improved
no one cares about lantern
yes..white  superhero good...brown superhero bad....
@samhosh vader  exactly  got a problem with that muslim vader
thank you! just emotional support to help me thus far haha! much appreciated  really hoping to make the quarter finals
a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man. embiggens  I never heard that word before I came to springfield.  I dont know why not. its a perfectly cromulent word.
when you mentioned it in a different video that people dont like being called boomers  I just thought maybe they could be called goers or macers.
let s be real  little to no one likes this ms marvel character any more than they like captain man-vel.
holy shit  with those gif entries she doesnt stand a chance  d
staying true to the source material is superhero movie adaptation kryptonite.
35 years old. yeah. and now I realize I should take better care of myself.  I look older than our boom girl.
getting some serious cw vibes from this show  it probably is going to be hilariously bad  and yeah they completely changed her power from the comics  both in origin and functionality.
I would never watch a movie about puberty either.  as a guy I remember it and didn t appreciate the hormones constantly tell me   now  now  now  can we do it now!!!!
you had me at kamala haris  subbed
I like the tank top bra steelers color combo melo!
robocop  terminator ect. someone s trying to get on my good side do you have any feelings on  80s cartoons  ie. he-man  thundercats
the crack in my screen protector lined up right in the middle of your forehead today. combine that with the blue tint and youreally did look like an alien for a minute. much love  chica.
what get s me about the  representation  is that its so obviously paint-by-numbers. I actually enjoy learning about other cultures and religions. but disney isn t interested in showing them authentically. they look at islam and say  ok we have a muslim character. how do we represent islam  .  I dont know. just show a few prayer rugs and a woman wearing a thing on her head. thatshould be good enough.   and then thats the extent of their representation.compare that with matt murdock of daredevil. they did a great job portraying his catholic faith because its an integral part of his character. its where he draws his morals from. so every time they touch on catholicism  its not just  show a shot of a rosary  boom catholic . they only touch on it when moral issues are being brought up. thats both relevant and interesting.
they changed her powers for the show your right she s the  female version of  mr. fantastic !
this has mcu spiderman vibes. nerdy protagonist becomes a hero.
Jesus!melanie is 35  she looks 25
the fact that I generally agree with you and the seemingly fact that you are Christian has given you my subscription.
I hope it at least explains why everyone s gushing over captain marvel given she s spent maybe a week top s on earth since she got her powers. couple of days in her origin movie that was very much not known  as no one in the other later movies knew of her   a brief cameo after the snap followed  bye Ive got to save the rest of the universe which doesnt have grief stricken heroes like you to to take care of it.  another brief cameo well away from any publicity during the end game battle and then she left again. unless she stays around longer in the tv shows no one should even know she exists.
she s a fan of ms marvel so she took her name!
melonie  if you want a nice amalgamation of western comics and maga  try iconic comics and this comic called kamen america.  and you should try to get yourself something from earthworm jim creator doug tennaple.
those aesthetics are not in the show only the trailer its trying to pull you in to watch
Im sticking with boomers  the offended can deal with it
they rush everything.
exactly. thats why daredevil was so popular. because the story was good   they didn t use religious believes as anecdotes.
its very hard to display a muslim person as there are different cultural iterations and also remember six days in fallujah  there was a bunch of agitated muslims no doubt they were just woke agitators  that hated the game.
my assertion is  if she is a superhero and can do whatever she wants  she shouldn t have any trouble going to prayers at the mosque with the men instead of the women. girl power.
no one really believe thatsuperheroes can have one of the major religions by the fact that in their universe literally life creating and destroying Gods exist ...
@notmy thing  if anything I d think that would make more heroes and civilians believers of one of the major religions. at the very least I doubt there d be many atheists once it becomes common knowledge that thor actually exists. people would start to ask what other  Gods  might be real
I was surprised when I first heard that too.
I can understand why they modified kamal s powers for cinema.  let s be real here  they d look ridiculous in live action.  mister fantastic had some goofy looking visuals as it is  but a kid having a hand be 6x disproportionate to her body   would just... look.... stupid.and you melonie  are one gorgeous alien.
Imentioned this in another video I am an adult woman and so ms marvel is not for me. I hope younger kids will like it. now would I be willing to watch a movie about a young girl growing up   yes. I gave lady bird a chance and edge of 17. this just doesnt look that insightful or interesting. Imay have watched this when I was 10ish. by 13-15 I was watching monty python  kubrick and reading Lord of the rings and octavia butler. I too was a nerdy girl so this would likely not have been what I would watched this as a teen.
I like the blue look of your video.  its a chill vibe.
I ll like your gifs when I decide to log onto twitter. I intentionally avoid it for the usual reasons.
if youre an alien  you ll understand when I say  nanu nanu.
I feel I have lost almost all interest in a hollywood movies  especially the big-budgeted ones  which is something I never would have said even just 3 years ago. most movies now dont feel like an engaging experience but just a product thats pull straight from the conveyor belt just to be consumed and quickly discarded. its fast food that doesnt even taste good. of course  there are a few exceptions like dune  I ll watch anything by denis villeneuve  and west side story but in general  there is just better stuff being made outside of the hollywood system and I d rather dedicate my time to entertainment that I feel was made with love and passion that tries to offer a good experience and that doesnt feel like a corporate cash cow.
marvel got really preachy like the rest.  its been hard to be excited about any of the new stuff coming out.  my friends and I used to be so excited for movies we d hit the midnight releases  but thats all gone.  also  35    no way!
first time  viewer  like your based opinions.  1 subscribe
disney definitely dont care about representation  if they did they would have always represented other cultures rather than starting now or recently
the camera lighting is in your room is as blue as the trailer made me feel
melonie mac you should play   the last of us part iI   because what you just said at the end of your video. it was foretelling in a part of the game !!    and no its not a small spoiler it was a small part of the game
4 34 exactly... the majority of people have no problem with female badasses- its the forced dialogue and scenarios that take us out of the movie and remind us we re being preached to. I love to refer to this show called revenge  where emily and her gay  bI   side kick take revenge on a bunch of elites. emily is a badass in this show. she s fucking awesome. she kinda pisses you off in the later seasons but Im assuming they simply tried too hard to make the show longer than itshould ve been. the point is that in this show- you aren t constantly being preached to. people loved so many female badasses before current hollywood decided to fight a battle thats already been won. they re just looking for a dragon to slay and feel like  the good guys .
if I was an alien I would be a saiyan
she s one of the most disliked characters in marvel because of the story arcs her creators wrote edited approved of. eI there was a long running story line where she and her  young avengers  were pulling people  mostly young white men  from their homes  in front of their families  because they would post something mean on the internet  and then she d rough them up before tossing them in the fricken raft or other hidden black site super max villian prison.the avengers video game is pretty much the best written and expressed kamala khan version to date  and this actress seems to represent the character very  very well from where I sit.big problems people have with the movie so far. the few fans she actually does have  3 cancelled comics  all cancelled very  very quickly as well  along with two cancelled team books which she was featured in  are upset because she is so young  which takes away chances for marvel to possibly have her in love scenes appears to bother people  they said the exact same thing about america chavez. well kinda  they said marvel made chavez so young so they could avoid having her in love scenes with other women . her powers aren t the same.problems marvel fans in general have noticed that her fans seem to have missed. not only are her powers different  which Im actually cool with in concept  as seeing her stretch all over with tv budget cgI would have been grotesque at best  but they made them magic based. let thatsit for a second. she s a devout muslim girl  from a very kind yet devout muslim family  using powers derived from magic  so she is essentially denouncing her religion every time she uses her powers. this isn t like a teen kid sneaking a few bites of bacon at a friends  this is a big deal. her costume. yikes. her costume in the comics is nothing great  and I believe she made her first costume herself and maybe her mother made the next  Im not familiar with her exact costume lore  but it looks nothing like thatsave the small skirt. in the comics its more of a tank top body suit with alone ranger style purple cloth mask and a cape thatstrats completely around the front of her neck and drops down on the side of her two shoulders with the middle cut out  kind it looks almost like a very long religious scarf almost. its not an awful costime  but I d see why they might want to make some changes for the shows and movies.not these changes though. she is a captain marvel superfan  but that costume is ridiculous and looks like something you d pick up at costumes etc. to rent for a halloween party. it just looks weird. a few of her fans were bitching that ms. marvel is skinny and awkward  not chubby and goody  but most people aren t saying much about the weight thing  so take that as you will.lastly  people are taking issue with the  brown girls from jersey cant be super heroes  or wtv line and goofing on itsince we ve had a lot of dark female super heroes  heck  the elite gaurd in wakanda is pretty much all elite women super heroes  so idk why they would be stupid enough to put that line in. maybe if they left out brown and girls  no  that wouldn t work since you have spidey from jersey and captain america from brooklyn. no not girls from a hard working ny suburb  but certainly super heroes  so itshouldn t be a surprise beyond  oh my allah  Im a super hero!!! Im actually a bit torn on this one because the actress seems to nail the good character attributes of ms. m.. the goody attitude  the kinda awkward social aspect etc  and even with that line I doubt they re going to focus on the muslim part  which is actually a bad thing  but they want it to air in chna so...   so it might just be the occasional throw away line they ll toss in once in awhile to virtue signal which if you aren t hyper aware of can be ignored out of hand  Im normally pretty good at thatsort of thing myself. I really liked wandavision for instance  but could not finish watching lokI as when its that overt  well you can only ignore things so much as they are slapping yourepeatedly across the face with it. then hawkeye came out and I was fine with it. same with the black widow movie  which I thought was fine until the third act and saw taskmaster turned into a cyborg paralyzed woman  of color    . on the other hand  though I did get through falcon and the winter soldier  the politics ruined it for m. again  you can only get whacked upside the squash with identity politics and characters behaving  well out of character so many times before youre shaking your head in annoyance. then once you do notice and register it  it is impossible not to continue noticing. I also could not get through eternals  and I tried as I was an actual fan  having bought about 50 comics when they were in print during the  90s  but that movie was just so disjointed  all over the place  with characters I liked being the wrong color and sex  behaving nothing like their comic book counter parts. luckily it was so boring I fell asleep all three times I tried to watch it  so no biggie I guess.and that  ms. melonie mac  is about all I have for why people are pissed  with the worst being her powers being switched from  inhuman  to magic! based  even if they ditched the stretchy  they should have come up with a cosmic reason  or bitten by radiotive silly putty reason  not magic. bad call. she d literally be killed in most muslim countries for that  and absolutely disowned  even in the fake us marvel universe. heck  even moreso in the marvel universe. thats just stupidity. add in the brown girl from jersey line  the silly costume  and a tone that is about 15 years minimum below her actual fanbase s age and yeah  marvel has another disaster waiting to happen on their hands. keep in mind  this is with months of re-shoots too. crazy that the only  north american  teen based super heroes in series are decent have been a cartoon on amazon 99  of comic book fans had never heard of and  stargirl  from dc on the c-fricken-w  dont care what anyone say  thatshow kicks ass . end novella
0 16 if youre using excessive blue light or orange light  you should set manual white balance
ms marvel keeps getting rebooted and she even had the leading role in the marvel video game  but she has consistently been unpopular. the only reason marvel keeps pushing her is because she s the pet project of vp sana amanat  who right now is rumored to have been fired for inappropriate relations with staff . I would not be surprised if this was ms marvel s last chance and that marvel will quietly disappear her when the show fails to find an audience.
it feels more like a super hero version of sabrina the teenage witch as opposed to a action super hero show. which is fine  but it is for a certain target audience that isn t me.
melonie mac  go boom merch and daily uploads to rumble please.
nice video you are very correct about not pleasing everyone but as Christians we still need to be Christ-like  on my own channel Im trying to call out woke paradigms that are false  why being fair and being a man of God  its not an easy balance but we have that responsibility.
disney turning marvel into shark boy and lava girl.
I dont think its a problem of these films being fast food garbage. I think the focus is on political ideology and not good story telling. the result is a bunch of pictures and sounds on a screen that dont resonate with your nature.
@does not apply yeah  I probably should have mentioned the blatant pandering and political stuff is part of the reason for me not caring about hollywood anymore  for the most part. thatstuff makes me wanna roll my eyes so far to the back of my head.
they ve been preachy for a long time now
also regarding her powers  they re changing them in the comics to match her new powers in the tv show. you found some people who liked her old powers  but the general consensus was thatshe rarely used her shapeshifting powers to her full potential and only ever gave herself giant hands. my guess is that the change of powers is to try and get broader appeal from that highly coveted young female demographic that they re obviously aiming for  because again  ms marvel s consistently struggled to find an audience and the sales reflect it.
dont do sabrina  the og  like that
@victor von doom  lol  I dont think sabrina was something to defend  but have at it if you liked it. as we dont know how good or bad this show will be it remains to be seen if its a knock. the point was it looks like a show more about teen drama with super hero powers as a back drop like how sabrina is a teen drama with magic as the back drop.
@raymond weiss  sabrina the og at least was quirky and kinda fun this looks like hot garbage masquerading as a superhero show and I wish ppl would stop saying  its for the children  I remember kid s shows being awesome like ben 10 or star wars the clone wars they also had occasional brutal and badass moments this is garbage
not to bash inspector gadget because its  good oldschool cartoon but liking kamala khan ms marvel and watching this movie is like loving robocop nd ending up watching gadget they changed her powers and went way over the top with everything.
thank God we have your reaction to balance out grace rudolph s  dont know how to spell her name  beyond the trailer reaction.... her subs are all antI wyte flaming sjws
with all the neon colors  idk  I feel like Im watching a trailer for infamous first light.and the creator  sana amanat just got fired yesterday. lol oh the irony.
I prefer dc these days I think largely because I am bored of super hero movies. dc with batman is the only ones right now who are trying to take the bat universe in to a more grounded place. for me joker and the new batman are closer to where I want to go with things.
just get over it  is code for really saying  shut up and submit to the narrative.
fear is the path to the dark side. fear leads to anger. anger leads to hate. hate leads to suffering. I believe the woke crowd has a fear problem. the faith is strong with you.
nothing gets me more interested in a movie like checking off ideology boxes again and again throughout the movie! Im psyched!
20  likes to views means you have a grip on this  mm. dont hold back. get yours.
the people saying its for teenagers why does it bother you  should keep thatsame energy when she s introduced into the marvel movies.
if disney believed in turning red they would have put it in the theater. the movie wasn t bad a little all over the place. but yeah obviously disney didn t believe enough to put it in the theaters.
apparently they changed her power because it was too expensive to do as it was originally. and so that ms marvel didn t step on mr. fantastic in the upcoming fantastic four movie they re supposed to be making. also someone said that the bands are supposed to be a throwback to the nega bands worn by og captain mar-vell to further connect ms marvel to captain marvel. but this just looks like a 90 s teen tv show like  parker louis cant lose  or even bad cw. and it looks this bad after a ton of reshoots. imagine what it looked like before them. oh btw  ms marvel and the vice president pronounce their names differently.
just dont understand how a character that cannot with regularity maintain a solo title  much less sell copies of said titles  especially in 2021  those numbers were so so so sad   was panned as the main playable character in the recent aaa pc title  sales numbers and player reviews dont lie    and is an obvious self-insert by the now mysteriously missing vp of marketing for marvel comics sana amanat is still getting pushed onto people as one of the main faces of the mcu.
your first crush was robocop  mine was batman. xd
to me it doesnt seem like she wants powers to actually help people  but just so she can be  cool   which seems very selfish.
endgamewastheend
marvel was way ahead of the curve when it came to diversity.  marvel however was purchased by disney and disney is about the money and as a corporation thats been around for quite some time they have the long view  and the characters from marvel and star wars will rake in money for generations to come.  as a marvel fan the only thing I know of about ms. marvel is thatshe was a somewhat obscure character in the marvel universe and with slumping sales was absorbed and killed by rogue when she was part of the sisterhood of evil mutants before she joined the x-men.
you know what Ive noticed on twitter lately  when Imock stuff like this or a good example  when Imocked g4 for their twitch streamer hypocricy  dudes who normally white knight called me an incel. I find it hilariously ironic considering the dudes who use that word to attack others are the same dudes donating to hot tub streamers  declaring themselves  male feminist allies  and support onlyfans. talk about pot calling the kettle black lmao
you should do a sonic 2 trailer reaction
as someone who did read her comics  I can say that  yes  her powers are changed. but her entire personality is the exact same sith absolutely no differences. that one guy who said ms. marvel was awkward because of her powers is completely wrong. she was awkward long befote she got her powers.also  I dont feel this show is pandering. there are times where I watch movies and shows where I cantell they re pandering  even though I dont necessarily have a problem with it   but marvel seems to ride a fine line between pandering and portraying minority characters accurately  and they definitely lean on the accurate portrayal side far more than they do the pandering side. falcon and the winter soldier is a great example of that. its not shoving anything down our throats  its not acting like its doing something new  and its not being disingenuous. every scene with isiah bradley specifically is absolute perfection  and I couldn t expect any less from a black showrunner.ms. marvel seems to be doing the same thing as falcon and the winter solider when it comes to its representation. its tackling it from a very real and accurate level  and it doesnt feel forced. unlike all of the cw dc shows.
tell us youre an alien without telling us youre an alien ms. mac  its ok tell the mothership we wont tell your secret lol
its called being delusional.
marvel-  logic is for bigots
disney changed the power set of ms. marvel because most people  comic fans sorry  complained about her original powerset. it made her look stupid and was too much of a rip off from fantastic 4 s mr. fantastic... but like the discount version or  off brand . I like the changes of this trailer and if disney plus wasn t such complete trash  I would allow my daughter to watch this. haven t show her the trailer yet so I dont know if she would like it. she wont look for the trailer herself because the current attitudes at both marvel and dc have turned her completely away from comics and to manga.
your a beautiful soul God bless ya.
yo  listen up here s a storyabout a little guythat lives in a blue worldand all day and all nightand everything he sees is just bluelike him inside and outsideblue his housewith a blue little windowand a blue corvetteand everything is blue for himand himself and everybody aroundcause he ain t got nobody to listen toIm blue da ba dI da ba daida ba dI da ba dai
Im fine with this. never cared about ms. marvel  but powers aside  she seems accurately portrayed.
crystal lantern show!
yeah  I dont really think marvel cares about ms. marvel except as a symbol of wokeness. I actually think she s a pretty decent character for what she is - at least  she started off that way  I haven t read much of her recent stuff - but she s clearly just getting shoved in everywhere because marvel wants to go  look! look! a brown person who we can use as a mouthpiece for our views! take that  everyone we dont like which is most people! .incidentally  you say youre not much of a comics person - are you at all interested in european comics  I ask because youre such a big tomb raider fan  and a lot of european comics have a similar vibe to those games - adventure stories and sci-fI fantasy stuff are particularly big over there.  and  of course  all the classic games have a bit of a european vibe to them  because they were made in the uk.
I usually take the  wait and see  approach with marvel shows. some hit the mark  others kinda dont. but it looks like its reaching out to their key audiences of families and some comic book fans  so we ll see. it ll take a lot to top the square enix version tho  I really liked that particular take.
in my best morgan freeman voice    melonie mac is blue. da ba dee. da ba die.
hey great content. your observations are very astute. I have to say though  with upmost respect  that your armpits could have their own onlyfans.
kamala khan is the 4th  ms marvel. all with different names  origins and powers. this character is a reinvention of the 4th.  kamala was created in 2013 and was designed with identity politics in mind. the idea was to portray the struggles of a muslim american in new york post 9 11. yes she had stretchy powers  shapeshifting  healing factor  bioluminescence  biomass manipulation and super strength. in this adaptation of kamala  her powers are basically green lantern but purple and no ring.
representation matters... always. im almost 40 and cant wait for this.
I generally dont enjoy puberty-centric stories  and at the same time will proudly burn on the hypocrite pyre for loving big mouth. xd
I like the  git gud  one.
I dislike whenever anyone says  you have to watch it to have an opinion.  this though I dont care because the only thing I liked about ms marvel  carol danvers  was she gave rogue her flight and strength. I know nothing about the new ms marvel other than it is self insert fanfiction.
easy skip they changed her power set too
as an adult man  I have 0 interest in seeing thatshow. however  if the show flops Im sure I ll be called toxic and be blamed for its failure even though Im not the target demographic.
billy batson is the real captain marvel. marvel s attempt with the character name only had relevance when rogue gained her abilities. now  rogue was a strong female character everybody loved.
no one care about puberty except those that haven t gone thru it yet. so this is for the young young lmao
thats the woke  prog mindset of writing female characters. kamala has an awkward personality  thats fine  but then they have their guidelines for portraying women  so they cant have her powers also be awkward too  because thatsomehow isn t empowering.its the same mindset that happened with captain marvel and her  not having to prove anything to jude law  when he tells her to fight him on an equal level. she doesnt wanna do it without using her powers  so she just doesnt  even as an indulgence and break from bein op in the finale. same way she doesnt have to learn or get better with her abilities  because she was always her best  it was just the shackles of the patriarchy holding her back.
lol this is going to bomb but because its on disney  you wont really know the numbers.
no they re not. its not accurate even to the original white ms. marvel.
@nukea6  appearance wise  yep. looks like kamala khan. and again  dont care about ms. marvel. white or otherwise. not even sure what you mean by  no they re not   btw.
@luridcontent   Imissed the  powers aside  part. forget what I said.
ms. marvel sucks in her comics  but outside of comics she s a pretty decent character. like in the avengers game or the avengers assemble cartoon. she s actually likable in anything other than comic books. but the unfortunate reality is that no one actually cares about her because she wasn t created to make an interesting character. she was created to be used for modern day feminist messaging.
@jcg s lounge  Im not sure if thats 100  true. I cant say anything about the game or the cartoon - haven t encountered either - but I did read the original ms. marvel storyline  Im guessing it was a miniseries  cant remember   and there wasn t anything particularly ideological political about it. yes  kamala s race and religion were highlighted  but it was much more about the whole  fangirl becomes superhero dorky teenage outcast  aspect  and she fought a crazy mad scientist with a parakeet s head  which was fun. if I were to guess  I d say the character was created just before marvel went super-woke  when writers still had to be at least a little circumspect about their politics  and then when the crazies took over  she was immediately seized as a symbol and things just went downhill from there. frankly  I doubt if either of us would have found much to enjoy about her  either in the spin-off media or otherwise  if she had been created as explicitly woke from the beginning - Ive read some of the characters that do fall under that category  and they almost uniformly suck.
every time a non white character comes its  wokeness
the only thing you need to know about ms marvel is that rogue touches her  puts her in a coma  and gains the ability to fly  be super strong  and near invulnerability. also. ms marvel was a blonde.
im so hyped to ignore that woke shit and save money in this global inflation
dc girl yessss
physical embiggen powers wasn t very appealing  so they changed her powers into a pseudo green lantern mental energy projections. thats a fundamental problem to feel the need to change the powers of a superhero youre adapting into a television show. then again  the problem started from the source. current marvel comic characters are unproven and simply pushed for ideological reasons. they re not so much characters as they are check boxes for social agendas.
this trailer definitely doesnt look like its for me .  which sucks cuz I think kamala khan is a cool and unique character.  not a fan of them changing her powers either but who knows  maybe they ll make for cooler scenes I guess  tryna be optimistic .  might show this to younger relatives to get their reactions.
I dunno about the show but the comics represent base fascism the arrest of a person character before they act on their thoughts of a crime. thats my problem with the modern ms marvel comics and character.
turning red was not as bad as ppl are making itseem  it was a good and enjoyable watch. I didn t make the connection that the main character was  going through puberty  until I saw others tweets like that one. it ain t that deep. great video though  keep going.
her stretchy powers are probably too expensive to do for a disney  series and in live action probably look grotesque.
oh sana amanat cares about kamala khan a great deal  since the character is 100  a self insert.the huge issue with the show is that ms marvel cant actually exist.  because captain marvel doesnt publicly exist in the mcu except to a very select few individuals and the general public does not actually know she exists.  if kamala khan based her whole super hero identity on captain marvel then that identity can not form in the mcu.
dayammm! she s sporting a ps5 controller in that gif!  p
I find it particularly interesting that playavengers laid down a dang fine roadmap of what a heartfelt kamala khan story should present as  and should feel like. and this trailer makes it look like the ms. marvel show will be the exact opposite.
my take on what has come out of marvel recently is multiple subtle middle fingers to the sjw narrative  yes I know they are owned by disney  thats another conversation  prime example  the  5 minutes of woman power  everyone is pissed off at in end game. most of  if not all of the women in thatshot earned their mantel as a strong female in their own right  except brie larson. everyone else kicked a    and brie larson literally got punched into space-time.
big marvel guy here. my daughter is 8 and she loves ms marvel. the trailer is cool... but we both weren t fans of the power change. its like they turned her into a cross between quasar and green lantern. I get it  fantastic 4 is coming  so maybe thats why they changed her embiggen powers
they already tried to make her the main protagonist of the avengers video game and it was a major flop. if at first you dont succeed  just continue down the same road over and over again. what a great model for success from the msheu. no offense to you  melonie but I hate the direction marvel has gone. the last great mcu film was the winter soldier. the success of the new spiderman should teach them a lesson about what makes a good comic book movie but it wont... sadly.
if youre an alien thats cool  better than the nut jobs on this planet
I  male  34  have to say  I couldnt care less about thatseries. the trailer bored me a lot. it might be good for teens but for grown up people  I doubt it.the real marvel hype actually is about doctor strange 2 and  for some people  moon knight.
no offense to the marvel series on disney   but they all blew. the best one had to be loki. the netflix marvel series were 10x better.
my reaction to the trailer   eh
I dont think this is for teenagers I think its for teen girls. also white liberals to feel better about themselves for watching a diverse show.
da dun dun dun dun dauhn duhnnn bahda dun dun dun dahnn duhnn bah duh dunnn...this is the x-men theme believe me.
youre referring to carol danvers who is the current captain marvel that has poor reception lol
@talentroller 44  captain marvel and ms marvel are not the same person iirc. also not to be confused with marvel girl  who we all know better as jean grey.
@i_drive_pro  all those events you mentioned there are carol s experiences who is captain marvel now. I know jean grey is a different character. carol s ms marvel experiences are irrelevant as she no longer is that character. kamala is ms marvel
that is correct   waitin  on dr. strange and moon knight . and morbius too   I guess .
@brad emerick  morbius didnt get me yet. but I am going to watch it anyway.
here s the thing  if a movie or series moves toward sjw themes by weaving them into the storyline  Im good. Imight roll my eyes or debate the scenes later  but Im fine with it.when you actually assault me with leftist tropes  anti-white Christian storylines and racist propaganda...... Im going to have a problem with it.
anime n manga still wins btw melonie jjk movie is coming in 2 days in theaters
the actres is actually 19  but looks 12.
they already f d it up by changing her powers.....doa
just a sidenote  kamala in finnish means horrible lol
long times no see
wait is your  go boom  because youre more like a boomer now  also great vids!
they always gotta ruin it with that one eye roll line. here its the brown girl reminding you she s brown. in batman it was catwoman s white privilege line towards batman.
miners are still trying to find source of the idea for this project.
alien or not youre still gorgeous
day 15 of commenting on your videos until g fuel sponsors me first crush was robocop.  based level over 9000.
bam! bam!booooom!!!!!
I saw you using a drawing tablet on one of your old videos  do you post art anywhere
youre 35  holy crap you look like youre in your early 20s!
diversity  disney hasn t been the same since michael dammann eisner left. and disney doesnt have a righteous bone in their body now
turning red is just teen wolf with a asian girl.
I cant figure out why if its supposed to be miss marvel  why do they use the abbreviation for mizz and not miss
like al things from or on disney   nice for the children.
I like the git gud gif
35      I thought you were like 22.... good genes!
I wish it was the original miss marvel

blue girl living in a blue world.
the last time a marvel movie a bit good was ironman 1
man they are really trying to push ms. marvel  1st they force crystal dynamics to make her the main character of an avengers video game and now a disney  show.
Im sorry... Im kind of new to this channel  but melonie is 35    what
the amount of ppl shilling for this is ridiculous
when youre blue  youre not an alien  youre a smurf. pls keep up with the times  grandma.  p
she said Im a superhero did she steal that from polka dot man
whaaaat   youre 35     no way .
I got banned on twitter for my first offense every by telling a dude that uploaded a video of him stabbing a dog that I would stab him.
I remember when kids had ben 10  powerpuff girls  danny phantom  and spectacular spider-man now they get this its a shame honestly
I believe its maybe a 10 year old character
commenting to feed the algorithm
tyrone magnus said it best when he watched the trailer   ...
passing on this
how in the world are you 35!
35  I wouldn t have given it to ya. good genes I suppose.
hey just wanna say Im praying for you and is there anything specific you would like prayer on
its always been the money  disney is the worst..
spectacular spider-man is underrated. its easily as good if not better than the 90 s show  and I dont say that lightly.
@the royal mediator  it was what I grew up on shame the new generation gets this
@victor von doom  I actually grew up on the 90 s show  which I loved  and its rare thatspidey s characterization is just right   but I was really impressed by spectacular. it was too bad that it had to end early due to rights issues. and disney s follow-up spidey show wasn t nearly as good.
@the royal mediator  the disney follow up was a disgrace peter got like 3 episodes alone before they introduced the spiderverse
@victor von doom  yeah  I was really disappointed with thatshow.
yup
grinchface lol
I wont comment on this show except to say that I wont be watching it as it was not made for me and I dont pay for disney . the main actress does seem very likable and perfect for the part.
let s be real  marvel studios decided to crap the bed the moment stan lee died. the movies are just gonna keep getting worse   nuff said.
hey mel I just want to say that I dont understand how marvel entertanment company make a movie called ms marvel bout a young girl having super powers which they already make a movie called captain marvel couple years ago bout a grown up adult young lady who had super powers and help the avengers to save the earth. anyway I just want to say and talk bout this topic of the new ms marvel movie  ok mel. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great evening at home with your pets and have a good nite  ok mel.
yeah its gonna bombcharacter has no stay power and comic hard fans for her wont like the power changes  hence them doing delays to get to here and still and still a fangirl to captain marvel who is barely known in mcu which is weird
shrug the trailer showed thatshe only wanted to be a super hero to be popular and get with the hot boy.  that kind of motivation is pretty shallow.
that   trailer looks like beep!
glad Ive been ignoring capeshit for 3-4 years now
ms marvel is a cw show with a disney budget
have you heard the church split podcast
wait mel you were on g4 in a bikinI where is the clip
youre 35 ! !
robocop  robocop. really
there s no way in the world you are 35  25 maybe
mcu stuff used to appeal to a wide audience  but this seems very narrowly marketed to teen girls. I dont think it bodes well for the ratings  which disney wont report unless its really good.
not with my money.
aghhhh the old jif gif quandary
I think Im gonna be sick
youre 35
camera looks great. u look like an awesome alien.
as a moon knight fan I was very disappointed with the moon knight trailer  so this is really no surprise.
hI  from what I understand is that the young girl with mrs. marvel power is from another dimension. so inside how there are multiple universes and that is where she came from there. also Im not sure though its only a guess and theory.
Im looking forward to eric july s rippaverse. but Ive liked superheroes since I was a kid. its sad to see marvel movies slipping in quality  though  and dc s been struggling to gain solid traction on their universe since the nolan trilogy ended.
yeah big surprises  thought thatshe 25 27ish was thinking I had a chance
at least they cast an actual pakistanI girl instead of picking a girl from any random place in the indian subcontinent.
hI there  mel.
marvel movies dont feel organic story wise anymore. Imean most movies nowadays aren t though so nothing new.
turning red was a waste if my time. and I loved encanto.
why is she called ms. marvel she s divorced
I think the whole  representation  thing is nothing but virtual signaling. make interesting stories  not check box stories.
she was by far the most annoying part of marvel s avengers game that just got released. which isn t boring well for me liking this show. lol
for the most part turning red is failing its not making the money itshould either domestically or internationally. partly because the characters are so horrendously ugly and partly because of the subject matter  youre right even today kids dont want to discuss bodily functions in entertainment like this  its gross and squicky to them.
35  wow look like youre 20 im 32 I look 40
have you stopped posting on rumble
wonder if they re gonna say whether she is shia or sunnI  no hijab  either
melanie how could you be so blind   she s receives her power by the nega bands she puts on her wrists. go to the looper on youtube on ms. marvel it will explain everything in full details.
I watched that trailer... reminded me of a cw show. thats not a good thing. the cw is going down the drain and cant get anyone to buy them out. why use that as a model
see I was in the demographic some years ago  and I wouldn t really like this movie and find it kinda cringy and annoying especially when they inject racial stuff  but I would go cause I would feel pressure to keep up with marvel movie lore and to observe the powers. but I wouldn t actually like it. I never cared about kamala which is also a reason
wait...youre 35  no fucking way. you look at most 22 23.
Im blue da bu de da bu dai.....
what ! 35 ! you totes give off 23 yr old vibes! where you get your genes from  forever 21
her powers are weird  they dont match the comics at all and her bracelets giving her powers is kind insulting to her character so this looks like a pass to me
as a big fan of the ms. marvel  kamala khan  comics as I am. this show looks like its gonna be a huge disappointment. follow the source material. so tired of hollywood always trying to reinvent the damn wheel. even the marvel avengers game presented her better than this.
Im not gonna watch the show. because Im not paying for disney .
so she did nothing of worth to gain her powers... just like captain marvel she has no hero s journey. also she is very self-centered   me me me  my dreams  my love interest  pronounce my name correctly  I am a hero yas queen   etc
looking forward to dr. strange 2...everything else...pass.
I think ms. marvel looks awfully cringy  and obviously aimed at teenage girls ... and since Im not a teenage girl  I think Im gonna have to give it a miss. I have to admit  I actually liked the character in the avengers game!
uhh they are accurate  she s a pakistanI american in the comics
yes she s supposed to be a stretchy girl according to the comics.  but nobody cares about this character really.  disney just pandering to checkmarks for representation.  maybe kids will like it  but disney will actually have to craft a good story and a likeable character rather than throwing in our face  representation! spend your money now!  cos thats a proven way to flop in the box office.  just see birds of prey and the 355 for such examples of fail!
I got into comics when ya boI zack started  and I kinda gave up after they rebooted it all. modern marvel  fans  care very little about powers  only about shallow references and shipping. ms marvel s powers are as confusing and nebulous as captain marvel and thankfully those characters are irrelevant to me.
is this the marvel character that rogue  a white woman from mississippI is going to kill
everyone goes bat man no go spider man
ppl are mad they changed ms. marvels powers. im glad bc thatstretchy shit does not look that good in live action. f4  the flash   the boys its borderline body horror
any other name than ms marvel.  like everyone has said  her powers come from crystal bracelets.  not a marvel.  just change the name to fit  instead of trying to get people to watch because of its name.
ms marvel suffers from apathy from all I heard. I few people like her but she s no miles.
the movie just screams women empowerment and we dont care about anything else
nobody is going to watch ms. marvel.              well   nobody who matters   anyway.
marvel has been trying to shoehorn this character into the mcu since thatsorry ass marvels avengers game  the process of the m-she-u has begun.
dc is soooo much better than marvel and always has been!!!!!
I agree with the points ideology.  now disney can see  look  we had a female hero  who was a muslim  so  score 2 points for us  aren t we so woke
ms marvel is carol danvers not kamala kahn thats an inclusion crap character and monica rambeau is farvel s captain marvel but not the real one thats billy batson.
meh.....I ll skip it.
thatsuperhero landing in the trailer is so horrible and cheap.. in fact  the whole trailer looks cheap af. and I cant take anything with the name  kamala  seriously.
as a marvel and dc fan Ive watched the batman which was great and I see this from marvel and its looks shit the mcu has been on a steep decline for the past few years now coz of identity politics and feminism when women are already in this stuff to begin with so I dont see the point
but Im glad they re bringing this as a pakistanImyself glad to see our representation in more different roles like this.
Im talking about accuracy with her powers and story lol
@melonie mac go boom  it definitely looks different but there was one scene where it did show her famous embiggen hands. its still early to say. Im looking forward to finally seeing a south asian superhero take to the screen
the og mar-vell had his power through the nega bands  which is essentially the same thing.  so that argument is out the window. instead this version does not resemble the faux-mr fantastic inhuman version that the comics character was
@pete wisdom  oh  thanks for informing me.
are you serious   have you checked marvel s box office results for all movies combined. its over 25 billion dollars. I would say that very successful business.
eh it looks alright  all of these superhero movies and shows look the same.
ms. marvel...  you mean shit fist   mcu 2.0 is in for some trouble if they think the last couple of releases is good  along with this and padme thor...
self-inserts always suck ass.
Im already not a fan.. so much propaganda behind this trailer.and its not about pandering. save for few items  disney tanked hard. they dont care about money  anymore. disney cannot go bankrupt.
dont know man... this looks like a teen netflix movie  and not the good onesmy question here is  will they portray the  religion of peace  how it works in real life or their ultra happy version of it
ok boomer
literally no body asked for this no body
never liked marvel much
it looks terrible
honestly....it looks like hot garbage.now terminator  total recall  robocop   x-men series  swat kats  etc. those are movies and shows I c an get behind.
Im not gonna go see ms. marvel Im tired of hollywood and pushing woke propaganda this is my favorite Bible chapter 1 corinthians chapter 15Christ died for our sins  king james version
as a muslim the pandering was unbelievably annoying an disrespectful
I dont want to sound harsh but this movie looks like a dud and sadly when it fails men will get blamed for yet another bad ideal of a movie.
it looks like its for children. as a 40 year old  Im going to have to pass. phase 4 is mostly crap so I wouldn t expect much from anything they re putting out.
there is no good to this character it is a virtue signal  she was made by woke people who have destroyed marvel  ms.marvel is carol danversshazam is captain marvel
looks more like a cheap netflix teen series rip off with a dash of diversity and superpowers and way too much bright coloursexactly the message should be subtle  not deep throated at the audience
and no gays and lesbians because some muslims wont be happy
this is the character that ruined marvel s avengers video game and totally destroyed that potential of quality of the game to bore fest. this is going to be flop have their seen the numbers of people not liking ms. marvel. utter useless from disney.
marvel and dc have become too normie  plain and oversaturated for me to enjoy. and this just seems like boring trash imo.
melonie  I saw your tweets on simpcast. the last jedI is your favorite movie ! unsubbed. tsk tsk
they will do the bare minimum and maybe show her praying the way muslims pray  they re not gonna be actually accurate about the muslim religion.
bahaha that was so hilarious. I had no idea they were even going to do those joke tweets and it caught me off guard - I got a great laugh lol
@melonie mac go boom  I did like what you said you d actually call simpcast - honest to God spit take. lol
this movie is going to flop  ms marvel couldn t be more boring if they tried.
ah gotcha  this is the hate reaction video. understandable  there s clearly an audience for that I suppose. you hate woke hollywood and long for the good old days...super original take!!! conservatism is fine just maybe drink less of that haterade. you dont have to take time out of your day to shit on something to virtue signal to your anti-sjw fans audience. we get it  the culture wars is the only thing you care about and is absolutely the most important thing in the world.  Imean  I think the dc universe is for emo goths who never grew out of their my chemical romance phase and worship nietzsche  without ever reading the guy   but you dont see me making a whole ass video shitting on batman do you  sheesh  take a step out of your bubble and talk to some real people before shitting on other peoples work.
this movie looks like crap....
this movie is a dead on arrival. the only people interested in this boring movie are karens and sjws.
ms. marvel is muslim. never heard a jew or Christian ask for representation.
