re  women protagonists as  woke.  just having a female protagonist isn t woke. woke is when the female protagonist a  never undergoes any hardships. b  without any justification  powers  training  etc  can beat anybody. c  is constantly validated through the movie. d  has all male figures be either villains or bumbling incompetents that need the female protagonist to save the day. the trailer didn t fall under those categories  imho. now  the movie may still revert to woke form  but the predator trailer didn t.
Ive got high hopes for black adam because his character role type is a heel and dwayne johnson was one of the best heels from back in his wrestling career.also  you got a thousand cool points when you said your dad is infantry. I was airborne infantry for a bit but then I went medic and worked with a sapper unit. my dad was a fighter pilot  too. military families are their own thing and I feel you about it. nice rants. stay awesome. go boom.
her cat everytime she starts recording   aight imma head out
honestly  my only issue with the girl hero is that even in mma  there s weight classes because even a few pounds matter. so  the female matching or surpassing a man physically  is a big stretch which makes it too unbelievable to me  unless its done like aliens and rippley  she couldn t match them physically so  they faught as a team and out witted the aliens or predators. with the new movies  I guess it also feels like a gender quota a lot  where I never got that feeling with rippley  like she could ve died just as easily as the men but she either got lucky or she barely missed death and had lots and lots of help. that feels more real to me. lmk if you think maybe thats what it is...
I liked the trailer. itseems gritty. they may have done the usual race swaps but I think thats to be expected at this point.
dj has been lobbying to play black adam for a while and I cantell he s getting everything he wished for! -- hopefully for better than for worse! black adam is a very classic shazam villain  and this film looks to be borrowing heavily from a strong anti-hero storyline in the canonical comics where adam decides to take over the corrupt middle-eastern nation of khandahar  if I recall the name correctly   finding and marrying the superheroine isis in the process!  originally from the 1970s live-action show paired with the live-action 70s shazam!  so he becomes a better person thanks to her -- but then sad things happen  alas. I suspect the lady in the trailer toward the end is going to be isis eventually.
you watch what you want to watch.  black adam looks like it might be good.  I dont know the character  so I am open to see how this plays out.  all in all  just be you.  from the time I was introduced to you on here  you seem to have a level head and I appreciate your takes.  if we all agree  life can get boring.  thank you for keeping me motivated in improving myself.  I say this as a raider fan.
it looks pretty interesting  its got a darker tone to it  at least they didn t put a bunch of marvel punchlines in it. I love your laugh at that point when he said  I do   lol anti-woke extreme backlash just fuels more wokeness imo. I think we ve got to a point where anything that doesnt have jam packed wokeness in it gets a pass.
its the role the rock was born to play. I think it looks like fun. also  pierce brosnan as dr fate is an inspired choice.
happy to see you enjoy black adam  prey  she-hulk  etc.   refreshing to see compared to all the hate everything s getting lately
melonie dont worry about liking what you like! its all just entertainment at the end of the day. we fans just are passionate and text is not the ideal way to convey a conversation. you know what Imean
matthew 18 15-17 is a good call. so often we spend time calling people out without either first addressing our own faults or thinking about the potential impact on themselves and others around them. gossip is like a forest fire - let itspread too far  and it could be seriously damaging. discipline is also important though  for the health of the church.great exposition on those verses  melonie!
dwayne johnson has been in some great movies  especially those when he teams up with kevin hart. jumanjI and central intelligence to name a couple. loved the rock in the mummy returns when he played the scorpion king.
your videos are always a nice part of my day  thank you
it will probably be fun enough  bit of a thor  1st film  feel to it with him being a  God  out of his element  but it looks pretty standard anti-hero origin story stuff  it looks like they ve changed the origin story a bit  see below  to make him more of a reasonable anti-hero  rather than a villain   which isn t surprising as they re hardly going to release a full-on villain movie.spoiler ish  - comicbook lore black adam is basically evil shazam  hence the lightening bolt   got his powers in the same way when his cousin     was chosen   decided to share his power to save adam s life   fight the evil empire that kept them as slaves  adam wants to genocide them  his cousin doesnt  so adam goes full evil   kills him.
I like your take. just because you have a different opinion on a movie doesnt make you  woke . even though I hear people saying bad things about a movie  I still like to see it myself. thats the best way to tell if I like a movie or not
what I always liked most about black adam was that he was magic so he always handed superman his ass and shazam cpt marvel always had to come help him lol
I think black adam will be great! thanks for sharing mel!
I am very excited for this movie. dr fate!!! the rock seems awesome cant wait to see him go up against shazam
for the most part  the rock s movies have minimal woke bs at most. those moments are easily overlooked. he has a special charisma about him that allows him to play himself in every movie and still be entertaining so it ll probably be at least a decent movie imo. only time will tell lol
agree!
I agree with your analysis but the new predator is woke  the idea of a barely armed  by today s standards  female in the comanche culture  very patriarchal  taking on a predator is laughable  I could then get into the mistakes regarding comanche culture at the time period of around 1700 but that would be a short novel.
@dean firnatine  sure its ridiculous  but thats hollywood. historical films are almost never accurate. doesnt make it woke. even a female rising in a patriarchal society isn t necessarily woke  like  say  the  original mulan  which wasn t woke  vs the live remake  which was . now  this is all based on the trailer. being 2022  there is still a good chance the end result will be woke as hell.
right on.
@cj carella  neither hollywood nor msm have disengaged from woke preaching enough for us to trust. too many franchises have been reduced to cheap fanfiction and too many fans have been alienated. the natural reaction to new releases these days is to mistrust them  and its gonna be a few years before that changes.wait for the next two or three dc movies to prove they re interested in making great entertainment. not the very next one.
100  agree. perfectly said.
@cj carella  that line in the trailer already make it pretty woke to me  why do you want to hunt    re   because you all think that I cant . this sounds like cope tbh. the plot is telegraphed so much that we know the predator is going to be a female one and its going to kill everything except the 1 comanche girl who talks and does sign language to her dog... Im allergic to this kinda thing already hulu disney can kick rocks.
the trailer  movie is not woke.. for now
@justin carloz maxino
I have to agree the predator trailer does seem woke.  just imagine if a guy or teen boy was in that trailer.  it would just seem dumb. a predator trailer should not be a voice over from the  hero .  itshould be a bunch of cool kill or narrow escape shots with the predator and little snippet cuts of the tribe talking about the  demon  or  evil spirit  who is killing everyone and what to do.  kill the spirit  appease the spirit  run from the spirit  ask for help from ancestors  ect.  there should be a legend about this from the past too.  this movie should be taking cues from the original predator movie like when the locals talk about how every generation or so something comes to kill them.  or like when the native american soldier takes on the predator.  Im not saying a girl cant defeat a predator but show instead of telling it  show it...even in the trailer.
youre describing the movie pray. she was even more of a mary sue character than ripley in aliens. that movie was totally unbelievable. the natives had magical kung fu theater style fighting tactics and a woman who mostly ran away was able to take down a being from another planet from a far superior evolutionary and technological society. its ridiculous its garbage. but then again all women protagonist in movies are usually unrealistic at least within the last 5 years in movies and television shows.
cole train like aw shit here we go again
exactly. it depends on how the movie is handled. to me  the logic of itseems absurd though. one predator took out a whole team of green beret mercs I think it was. I just dont buy the idea that any single person  male or female  could counter and kill a predator with stone-age tech and no prior experience against one.
yeah but Im getting bit annoyed by all this superhero stuff... like itseems that hollywood is almost incapable of producing something other then that these days... where are the fun adventure movies  where are the deep forrest gump movies  or green mile or something... or at least anything else then  here is a vigilante superhero that has been wronged or created in a lab  type of story.
honestly I dug this too. it was just like the comics too.
I agree melonie  things are getting better  I also agree with your take on prey
I cant wait to see dwayne johnson play the rock in black adam!
love this trailer  really fit the character I grew up watching on the cartoons and the video games. and a lot fan bashing this film and movies like joker and vemon for taken their characters to a different direction. movie are not like the comics fanboys
I think some folks hate the whole woke movement so much its clouded their judgement. you said it best  these aren t the movies to be bashing women leads. with thatsaid  I guess the entire game of throne series was woke because it was chock-full of female characters who evolved into strong female leads and the main villain was an evil wench to boot.
other then swapping carter hall it looks good to me.as far as woke stuff in prey I know there has been some leaks about the plot  I believe drinker has done a video about it.
it looks like an mcu movie  and thats been my big complaint about dc films outside of the snyder film universe. they may been disappointing to some degrees  but at least they weren t copy and paste of a rival. the copy and paste mentality gave us nerds  the r zone  and  the virtual boy
I agree with you! stopping the cancel culture by becoming the cancel culture is not the way!
I remember when the rock was in talks for being casted as black adam solely based on his hairline. well...back when he still had hair. honestly  I dont know much about black adam outside of his hairline and his shazam like powers.as far as the predator alien stuff goes  danny glover managed to beat a predator and we know he was too old for that  hit.also  linn kurosawa is my favorite bug killer.
I go to movies  to escape  reality  for a  few hours I dont  go to see reality I get enough of  that in my life
well I will say the obvious here lol  when it comes to any movie  tv show  etc.  every person on the planet will have their own feelings on the movie tv show  etc. so when it comes down to it  you  the individual  will either like it or not. so if you love the movie  awesome. if you hated the movie  awesome. in the end  all that matters is how you felt about the movie. for this movie  I will love it already because it looks awesome and I love the actors and everything.
I dont hate it. it looks fun  and I ll probably go see it.
just be a good person and I will watch what you got. good  bad  or ugly  Im here for it. since everything else is terrible politically correctness
hey melonie  have you heard about the act man getting demonetized  idk if that would be too drama oriented for this channel but since he does similar videos I figure it might be a good topic to talk about  youtube is really screwing over its creators and itseems pretty malicious at this point.
to be fair  I agree with you  people are just jaded by all the shite and making it a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy!
the rock as an anti-hero  it looks like its going to be great. I think he has fun when he gets to be a little bit of a heel  and itshows. definitely didn t see anything remotely woke in that trailer.
the movie looks awesome  and I have no idea what could be woke about the trailer
6 22 - I wonder how you would like the game  wanted  dead   Imight have mentioned it a few times in a few of your comments sections and at least once or twice in your discord .  I know its a weird title  but I guess I should inquire about the teams previous titles   ninja gaiden  and  dead or alive    or how much familiarity and or like you had  if at all  for said franchises.  Imention them because they have explosions  butt-kicking and some fun action  ninja gaiden  yes  dead or alive not so much unless youre into fighting games of doa s style .  its okay if its not your thing  I just thought you might appreciate it to some degree since it had a protagonist that kind of reminded me of you with her beauty  ink  and asskickery  that  and she wasn t wokefied as far as I cantell  beaten with the ugly meh boring stick   and seems to have a descent explanation of her badassery rather than just girl power  I think she s a cyborg to some degree and she might have some legitimate character flaws  but it might elaborate on her story and personal life as much as ninja gaiden and doa did with their characters  which is essentially not much.  they were some action focused titles and I dont remember much puzzle and challenge outside of what the fast paced combat may provide .so yeah  whenever you find the time to review what information their is for wanted  dead  it isn t out yet  there s articles here and there  but I dont trust them that much
hey you do you. stay yourself. some of us come here for that. so many creators are so absolutely blackpilled. any content that doesnt make me want to walk into the nearest mushroom cloud is a ok in my book.
not sure why  they re not introducing him in a shazaam sequel but looks kinda fun. not sure why people think this looks woke  - maybe just cause the source always puts out woke stuff. would be nice if things are starting to shift back.
but thats the whole point. we read about them in the comics  so when they come on the movies...itshould be the same
exactly what I was thinking.  carter is supposed to be of egyptian descent so  the typical white coloring in the comics has long been inaccurate anyhow.  I guess cyclone should be a red head  but as someone who is a jsa nut  I can objectively say they never did anything significant with the character after she was introduced. my big worry is that his reincarnated fianc  will be a good person. anyone who read 52 knows better
he has been making movies with ryan reynolds too much lol
your verse of the day was my verse of the day for my devotions. seriously  I read thatscripture before watching this video.
your beautiful  has absolutely nothing to do with the content your covering at the moment  but there you have it. love the content
I guess everyone is a hero now
I dont think the question with black adam is going to be is it woke    it is really going to be is this movie any good    if they treat dr. fate with respect in the film  it will probably be well received throughout the fandom.   dr. fate is probably as popular a second tier character that dc has in their universe.  screw him up and people will be big mad.   I cantell you that the best dc comic of 2021 was a team up between the flash wally west  and dr. fate that came out towards the end of last year.   in conclusion  I think many in the fandom should reserve judgement on this film until they see it.   aquaman and shazam were surprisingly not as bad as I thought they would be before I saw the films.  also  predator movies are hit or miss and I often times like some of those films more then many of the critics.   I thought predators 2010  with adrien brody was awesome and I know many dont agree with me on thatstatement.
I think it looks pretty good too!!!
looked awesome to me as well. maybe the coof made me lose my sense of taste too.
hImelonie I absolutely loved seeing your cat sneeking in.I usely like  dcmovies Im not going to see that .thanks for bringing this out their mayyou continue to .takecare melonie
until disney and corporate hollywood confesses to all the evil they committed and still commit  apologizes and repents  I shall never give those companies my time and money however possible.
never underestimate the mind of girls. yes  our emotions have a million swirls  but we are strong! never doubt us  we re never wrong. we have big hearts  and we try not to fall apart. our minds aren t complicated. our thoughts are just hated.
black adam is a sadistic leader who would do anything to protect kandhaq. he doesnt care who he kills or hurts to get what he believes is his  in the comics he became good bcuz he met a good women but when she was murdered he went berserk and it took almost all of dc to try to stop him but he still was kicking the butts of heavy hitters
been really enjoying the videos did you see the ms show  to see if you lost your taste keep up the great work
also  good grief  is pierce brosnan playing doctor fate !  -- that would be mind-blowing!
black adam looks pretty damn good. even if the story is so so everything else about itseems to be up my alley. the visuals  the tone  a protagonist who has no lines they wont cross. bring it  Im ready for dc to overtake marvel already because they should ve easily jumped ahead by now.
miss melanie..... I was never a huge fan of color lime green but for some reason... I dont mind it now.. I dont know why Im just messing with you I have to be honest like every time I watch one of your videos the first thing I say out loud is oh my God she s fugging gorgeousI didn t think that women like you existed the fact that easy on the eye s is a bonus of course I live in small town iowaI guess there s a community college not that far from here not going thereyou know what they call a woman like you herein a town of 900 people tourist or lost or a college student  there s a community college not far from here  just saying
I just watched it. it looks like it could be ok. no obvious woke drivel. Im not really sure what got you so excited about it but thats just me... Im pretty jaded  d ... it takes something really special to get me excited about anything these days   _   _    I think youre right though  it does feel like we re winning... slowly. also  as you mentioned here  just having a woman protagonist does not make a film game woke. we ve had plenty of great films games with strong female leads. some are my favourite films of all time... aliens  terminator  ghost in the shell  silence of the lambs... people on either extreme  right or left  are just dumb.
hImelonie  hope youre have a great week.  been seeing you a lot on fb  so hope your fame is increasing.  sorry to say though  I prefer marvel comics over dc  but this looks like it could become the best dc movie I have ever seen!  I lost faith in dwayne johnson  for throwing his political support behind biden.  haven t seen anything woke in this trailer  so I will be giving it a watch.  going to be watching the new thor this weekend ..... Im pretty sure that is going to be woke as.....  God bless.
it ll be interesting how black adam acts in contrast to shazam! once he runs into him down the road.
it looks good to me.  as long as they dont pull a bait and switch and the rock is barely in it  itshould be good.
black adam started off as a captain marvel  shazam  villain.  he is reference in the shazam movie  for he killed the wizard s siblings.  he has all the powers of shazam. he has evolved into an antihero.  consider him a darker superman.
this trailer looks to me what the mcu movies used to be like with like iron man and captain america and the beginners
I agree  I personally like marvel more than dc  but I want nothing more than to go to the cinema 10 times a year bc both marvel and dc are just dropping bangers lol. I hope this is the start
@mekhaI williams  we could ve had that this year if dc hadn t pushed so many projects back. right now I prefer dc just because for the most part they aren t under creative restrictions like the marvel stuff is  although dr strange and moon knight were steps in the right direction in that regard. I want there to be a legit back and forth between the two franchises in a perfect world lol
dc will never overtake marvel in anyway  shape or form. they were never really competition to begin with.
authenticity is why I watch youtube  when youtube personalities stop being authentic  thats when I stop watching
Ive always preferred the more serious dc tone. I hope this movie has that. the trailer had a mcu vibe but I still liked it.
I hope this isn t bait and switch. I want to see good movies again
this movie does look good. could end up being one of the better movies for dc. some people just love to hate on everything
diana in wonder woman not  woke.  rey palpatine in star wars   woke.
you said you dont want to be a grift channel.  you can do both.  sydney watson does a skit where she argues with herself.
ngl I think they did alright on this one because the rock is perfect typecasting for black adam but man Im feeling some super hero movie fatigue nowadays
yes! the puppy  is in the background!
I agree with you melonie  its not really woke. it just seems like a good movie.
it does look really good
black adam looks pretty good.  Ive heard of black adam but Ive never got into him   this makes me wanna look more into his origin.  Im a dc guy too  but I like some marvel of course. but I agree this looks great  Im hoping it is. ppl saying its   woke  are just wanting something to complain about.
hopefully dc sees the mistakes marvel is making. I think it looks good too!
people are entitled to like or dislike whatever they want  doesnt matter what group youre in or what side youre on.
trailer looks like fun. the rocl yet has to dissappoint me. I ll give this a chance. or not if they lock us down again.
the only issue I see so far is that they are making him good.  he is a bad guy!!!
this trailer does look good enough by all accounts. however  black adam is a villain  specifically shazam s archnemesis. so setting up a redemption antihero arc as his first movie ultimately should fall on deaf ears for fans of the character  who this movie should be for  as they ultimately know that any progress made in this movie is for naught as he has to become shazam s villain by the end. and with this not being the first time the dceu has gotten ahead of itself  such as with doing the death of superman storyline too early   people should be cautious with this movie. also  there is a risk that the rock will just play the rock in black adam cosplay like with other characters he has done.
I dont see anything in the trailer that would make me think black adam is going to be  woke.  I just didn t find it terribly interesting. I cant deny  I am feeling the superhero and the overdone cgI fatigue. and to be fair  Im lukewarm on the rock as it is  mostly because he s just always the rock. I do like pierce brosnan and sarah shahI  so supporting cast has promise. did he just catch a rocket  he just caught a rocket!  got me to both audibly and physically groan. it reminds me of  they fly now  they fly now!  from that last star wars movie  return of the emperor or whatever it was called. this humor is predictable and uninspired. and while it fits better in the marvel movies with chris pratt and deadpool and venom  it just feels tryhard in the dc movies.I dont want to be completely critical  and admitting I know nothing about this character from the comics   so I will say seems like we might get a decent character story out of this movie  so that is definitely something to look forward to. I ll probably see it  and it will probably be ok.edit-ok I just watched ya boI zack s review of the trailer  and I think he pretty much nails how I feel  he just puts it into words better.
well I do   super-powered chuck norris ! oh wait  thatstatement was an oxymoron in and of itself  lol
I have to agree the predator trailer does seem woke.  just imagine if a guy or teen boy was in that trailer.  it would just seem dumb. a predator trailer should not be a voice over from the  hero .  itshould be a bunch of cool kill or narrow escape shots with the predator and little snippet cuts of the tribe talking about the  demon  or  evil spirit  who is killing everyone and what to do.  kill the spirit  appease the spirit  run from the spirit  ask for help from ancestors  ect.  there should be a legend about this from the past too.  this movie should be taking cues from the original predator movie like when the locals talk about how every generation or so something comes to kill them.  or like when the native american soldier takes on the predator.  Im not saying a girl cant defeat a predator but show instead of telling it...even in the trailer.
I see that cole train slipping by lol  3
some people love to hate everything by default.  I would like to see what they actually like
shazam isn t really a villian tho.. he s kinda like doctor doom in a sense. he does wtv it takes to benefit himself or his people. and if that puts him in the position to where he has to fight the justice league or society then so be it.
yeah it lolks cool and Im a black adam fan so I look forward to itspoiler comicbook lore adam gets his power from six Gods like shazam but his six Gods are egyptian in natures  the stamina of shuh  the swiftness of horusa  the strength of amonz  the wisdom of zehutI  also known as thoth a  the power of atenm  the courage of mehen
I honestly dont see the issue of women in leads for movies  as its already been done in popular movies  like ripley in alien  but I think that when the woke crowd try it currently  they rely on lazy writing  which ruins what could have been a good character
she woke y all! revolt!
I think some people expressing dislike and or criticisms for female  or whatever minority  leads likely  comes from not trusting these big studios to do it without woke agenda pushing. not that I agree with that kind of reaction. I think we should support good entertainment  especially if they do things like  good female protagonists  right so that we can show what we mean when we want good characters.
I say give black adam a chance. it might be fun!
melonie you forgot another badass female that I feel dont get the love for being a badass and that is cynthia rothrock. she was a total badass in the 90s who has five black belts in martial arts as 8th dan grandmaster undefeatedin competitions. I dont know if you watched the movie yes  madame where she co starred with michelle yeoh she kicked so much ass in that movie and made big box office money in hong kong. for me a badass female character can be strong badass but it also needs to have personality and the motivations for why she is pursuing x as well as fatal flaws that hinders the character progression in the plot to reach the endgame of the movie. captain marvel and rey skywalker are examples of how not to write a female character in movies as they are mary sue s compared to a ripley or xena the warrior princess who had fleshed out characters in their respective series.
this looks like a good movie but Ive been fooled before by a decent trailer.  part of it is that I dont know anything about black adam.  I was a little disappointed in this particular trailer because a few years ago  I was more hyped for black adam when the rock was talking about doing black adam with comic or movie stills in the background.
im soo tired of hearing drstrange and wanda. and now we get drfate. im so freakin hyped
my soul waits in silence on God alone  from him comes my salvation. he only is my rock and my salvation  he is my refuge  I will not be greatly shaken. how long will you attack a man  to batter him  all of you  as you would a leaning wall  a tottering fence  they only conspire to cast him down from his high position  they delight in lies  they bless with their mouth  but they curse inwardly. selah my soul  waitsilently for God  for my hope is from him. he only is my rock and my salvation  he is my refuge  I will not be moved. in God is my salvation and my glory  the rock of my strength  and my shelter  is in God. trust in him at all times  you people  pour out your heart before him  God is a shelter for us. selah surely people of low degree are a breath  and men of high degree are a lie  if they are placed in the balance  they are altogether lighter than vapor. do not trust in oppression  and do not become vain in robbery  if riches increase  do not set your heart on them.

I think we re just all on edge  we re so used to hollywood taking what we love and ruining it just for a message  we expect this now because its all they ever do  theyve even resorted to bait and switch tactics of giving us a bit of what we want in a trailer and then the film or show is exactly what we expected  and so far it hasnt changed and it hasnt gotten better. its misleading and they know it and when we get mad they weaponize it  they set the expectation to be disappointed and on edge so to be fair its what you can expect from people in general  its like you cant win as a fan anymore no matter what you do.
I am in full agreement with the sentiment. I am against race swapping gender swapping  stuff like that and the argument was always  make new characters instead of        swapping   and I feel like that is what they are finally starting to do and instead of appreciating that people are still saying woke this and woke that. I do however think they can do more  a new blade is coming which I am all on board for as I loved blade... well at least 1 and 2.
looks a ight.  looks better than most dc stuff.  the prey movie trailer looked okay too.
five years ago I would have been very exited about black adam  but I am so tired of dwayne johnson that I doubt I will go to see any black adam movie but I admit this looks good.
you are a dc fan because they tend to define between good and evil more distinctly.
hey melonie I just want to say that dwayne johnson is the best actor in movies ever and he got big muscles like king kong and Godzilla too. anyway also he can do some really good beat down on those who messed with him in movies  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that I think that this movie is going to be good and exciting to see and I can not wait to see it and tell everyone including you bout how the movie was in the theater  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to comment on your video for today  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
I dont think is woke   but I am not hyped either   this is more like the fast and the furious  when it comes out I will watch it    probably like it  but it doesnt make me eager to see  like a new alita battle angel or new dune would  those are what I would call great   will watch it though.
anyone played metroid back in the 80s or 90s  before there was lara croft  there was samus aran - and she was amazing!! who doesnt love a woman in a power suit taking on aliens on planets that eventually explode ps no disrespect to lara croft  nervous laugh
dr fate s helmet is missing two eye holes.
its not woke when female characters are central or included its woke when they no longer sound and act like a human being
I think the problem what antI wokeies have comes from hawkman being black this time.. but im pretty sure originally hawkman supposed to be egyiptain so actually this is the first time they got that right.. otherwise I feel like this movie is going to be good but at least better then dr strange 2 was  or morbin time xd
its the equivalent to getting a fortune cookie with no cookie just the paper
exactly!
melonie we will have to agree to disagree.  what they did in my opinion is  take adam s and Jesus s stories and twist them. not woke  I would have to say border line blasphemist. but what is sad is those who do not know the scriptures  will have no problem with movie. sorry I am so hard headed when it comes to stories that try to a slap at God in a round about way. again just my humble opinion. I still love you though  in a brother in Christ way. stay safe and God bless. oh I liked seeing your pup in the background!  lol.
the real black adam is a pure villain that wants to enslave humanity. you know johnson was never going to play that character.
ill have to check it out with sound. whats up puppy!
I dont think there is just woke and anti-woke.  there is also just the nothing  the absence of woke.
I had a audition for this film but I couldn t make it
I believe alot of weirdos take the antI woke movement to the extreme sometimes. they twist the meaning behind anti-wokeness for their own mysogynistic views. like bro  talia al ghul is a leader of assassins in the batman comics. imagine saying  I dont like the league of shadows just because a female leads it. well buddy  I dont like you because  I like women.
I used to buy comics every wednesday until 4 years ago when dc especially marvel went full blown woke and just garbage writing and art. I love shazam and black adam so I was excited until last year when I gave up on super hero movies. this doesnt have me excited at all  I hate how they keep making literal evil mass murdering villains into  good ppl . antI hero ehh whatever but they re villains let thembe villians. hawk man is egyptian  Im egyptian why did they cast a black guy  I d be happy with an arab sure doesnt have to be egyptian but straight up just west african black american as an egyptian  nah dude and they made cyclone this hot redhead a black chick yet again hollywood erasing redheads. there s legit articles on how redheads are erased and swapped with a black person every-time lmao
melonie is damn hot as hell.
dr fate is in it ! and might have a pivotal role  Im pretty hyped. I guess its woke because hawkman is black. yeah  well....billy dee williams did a pretty good harvey dent  so I ll give black hawkman a chance.
please reaction on kgf2. trailer kannada movie please
re prey she cant defeat a bear.she  allegedly  has no warrior experience  since she isn t allowed to be a warrior.her tribe of warrior men appear to get wiped out by an invading white-man infantry and a predator.she goes head-to-head with the predator using sticks and stones.she will single handedly beat the predator.she alone saves the tribe from the invading white-man infantry and predator.I would say thats not  not-woke. I dont have an issue with it being a woman  but I would say the wokeness is being telegraphed pretty loud and clear . and its supposed to be a trilogy so...I suspect whatever is in there  it will get worse.
I just watched the trailer while in the theater and yes it does look great  and I want to go see it. also it does look woke  woke is code for cultural communism  it doesnt mean leftism
I dont see what is wrong with it either. I think the community is used to complaining about things.
first off  100  agree dc is better than marvel. I hope the full movie lives up to the trailer  cause it looks very promising. gives me deadpool hancock vibes.
mirror forge longplay.  if you have time.
we re going through hard times considering what keeps happening to our favorite franchises  so as a cynic I totally get being bitter about almost everything that comes out. but I dont think its healthy to hate everything that might or might not tick woke boxes.people need to calm their expectations and learn to ignore what they dont like instead of ranting about it endlessly.I like watching folks dismantling trash movies and shows on youtube as much as anyone but all the negativity just gets as annoying as the woke pandering now.
I dunno who the hell is labeling this as woke. if we re just gonna throw that word around now at everything  then we ll end up like the far left where we throw labels around at everything and they start to lose meaning.
samus metroid longplay.  alien isolation longplay.      if you have a chance.
I hate woke stuff as much as anybody  but this looked fine to me. a good popcorn movie. I bet its better than dr strange 2  not a high bar  granted .
thumbs up for the nice tank top
I still want to work with the rock someday
you d have a point if black adam wasn t a literal anti-hero sometimes.
@josh cramer  youre doing the exact same thing  dude.not everything is woke  just as not everyone complaining is an extremist of any kind.most normies are just frustrated with getting beat over the head with some sort of messaging in their escapism. maybe people are more  forgiving  about right-wing stuff in movies etc.  which one might question  but thatstill doesnt make them extremists.
@max  calling literally everything  woke  nowadays is a pretty extremist take.
@josh cramer  call me nitpicky but I dont think of it as extremist  more like primitive  too lazy to differentiate or whatever.you sure have your bad apples but most of them are just tired of it all.so am I btw. technically Im part of the lgbt crowd and I am tired of the pandering  too. I dont need to see some version of myself on a screen because I can like or empathize with any kind of character.I am boring  I dont wanna watch myself lol
I agree that black adam doesnt look woke but I do think it looks incredibly generic and from a comic perspective he s supposed to be an out right villain not an anti-hero  so there s an argument for that. regardless  I love you and respect you opinion and taste
if I listened only to anti-woke reviewers I would not watch anything because they tear everything down. I get that we have been jaded by woke movies but I feel the tide slowly turning and we should acknowledge and encourage it instead of looking for small things to complain about and saying the whole movie sucks.
hey mm hope u doin ok
how was any of this woke  lol. you have a bunch of jacked up dudes going up against a super jacked up dude. if this trailer says anything  I ll probably be one of the dudes flexing my muscles in the theater from all the testosterone pouring out of this movie. the hawkman and doctor fate costumes are so lit!!
mel never answers any of my questions.
I do not like prey  specifically because the protagonist is a native woman. the idea that one of them would ever consider becoming a hunter or provider for the tribe is patently ridiculous. any tribe of natives would shun and ostracize a member that refuses to play their role in the tribe  especially if she tried to fill the role of a man. she would most likely be raped  physically scarred and sold to another tribe as a non-person. ridiculous to the point where it would be impossible to suspend disbelief. the comparison to ripley is also ridiculous  the characters share nothing in common but a vagina. nothing about their culture or circumstance is even remotely similar.
this is far from woke. there s no way marvel would ever have a main character gloat about killing people. this has a masculine dude being masculine. thats one thing dc does well. superman  batman are allowed to be strong and aren t dumbed down for a female to be better. wonder woman fits in and holds her own  on her own merit.
the rock was a perfect pick for black adam.
the woke anti-woke argument is way too black and white.  its like the current environment where dem   far left socialists! and rep   maga ignoramuses.  supporting lgbq  women  minority rights means I cant feel a bit odd about casting a black little mermaid  due to nostalgia for the original    its a spectrum in my opinion.  in the end  its just respecting your fellow human being.  for me   it isn t about elevating minorities in movies  or feeling white privilege is under attack  and I cant stand the term  woke . it feels smug to it imo .
I thought the dog was gonna squirt @ 4 02
boom!
I only come here because I have a pulse.
Im a huge rock fan  but so far black adam trailer isn t getting me excited for the movie. it is nice seeing rock in something other than white t-shirt and khakI pants
if people are calling black adam woke it is probably because they race bended every jsa member except doctor fate.
but Im just sick of superhero movies. I just want something else. another premise for my movies. anything thats not a superhero.having said that it does look pretty good. so here s a take some might not like too. I think there are a lot of people who s channels have become anti-woke and totally negative towards everything thats come out recently. and the worst part is that I think they are doing it for clicks.  just like the wokies are saying their stuff for clicks we have a good number of people I once respected whose channels I have had to unsub from.  I ll give an example and its doomcock. I just  cannot stand his over criticism of kenobi. shows not great but its not that bad Im enjoying it enough that I ll refrain from flaming it with every once of my being like dookcock does. now he s still on point about star trek but that franchise is lost. thats a hopeless cause while kurzman has it under his control.
black adam looks fine so far  its still way to early to speak of its quality  also I dont understand the people saying the rock is just playing himself here  have you seen the rock in any movie before!!   thats not how he acts at all  itseems he is taking this role quite seriously  and its clear he isn t going to start suddenly playing with his eyebrows or saying funny quips
@melonie mac go boom       to thine own self be true.
I looked fun. some people are too nit picky and cant be pleased these days.
smooth-brain reporting in  liked the video. monkey-vision detects no dark magic. enjoy boom-boom. enjoy bang-bang.smooth-brain signing out.
hey everyone needs to look into the quantum and act man situation! youtube is awful!
actually he is an anti-hero in his solo series.
@andrew naftel  are those new  because Im not familiar with any solo series  just his villain appearances in other peoples books
the movie looks pretty good action and cinematography wise  but the race swapping bs kind of puts a damper on things. I like the rock though  he usually doesnt disappoint.
Im just upset he s bald
commenting to feed the algorithm
not saying prey is woke but it looks like a ripoff of the fan film warrior  predator which in my opinion does look better then prey but its still early could change.as for black adam he s the evil original version of shazam which was pretty good so hopefully this turns out like a more serious version of that.
I really liked the trailer and honestly cant find anything woke about it.
for me it just looks like a generic run of the mill superhero movie. it doesnt look dark enough for a antihero villain movie.  the missing pointy ears and no accent makes me feel like we re getting rock adam instead of black adam
people who use the phrase space unironically are cringe af
it looks good  but I am biased rock fan.
this is classified as woke I think it will be a mediocre or decent movie  but we will have to see what the rest of the movie holds.
female lead  male lead  native american  white  black I dont care.its a disney movie  do you expect it to not be woke because of a trailer  Ive got a bridge to sell you then !because they never bait-and-switched us before. this movie is woke unless trusted sources say it isn t. its the safest way of acting when we talk about disney productions. Ive been burned enough time. Im not giving them the benefit of the doubt anymore. they can get bent.
mI issue with  prey  is...the trailer look amazing  just like  the predator  trailer looked amazing  but theovir was trash
this is a the rock movie. same dwayne johnson from scorpion king  tooth fairy  rampage  san andreas  jungle cruise  and many other subpar the rock movies. you ve fallen for the gift wrapping around the box full of dog shit. woke not woke is irrelevant when its a dwayne johnson movie
not a fan of the rock as black adam he has the look but not the acting chops to be black adam. Im a die hard black adam fanboy and the rock is just playing himself like he does in almost all his films. the justice society looks awesome though love hawkmans look which im a massive justice society fanboy as well and pierce bronson as dr fate is epic casting. the trailer looks alright but not like how black adam has no accent not good  felt like a mcu trailer to be honest and sc copying the marvel formula hasn t done them any good
women protagonist are grate  but dont replace male heroes with female versions. why cant they fight side by side. that is what makes a good story.
the way I see it is  dc is either hilariously bad or super good  whereas marvel is completely mid with the exception of about 2 mcu movies.
it looks completely non political and fun
Im not a dc fan typically.. almost all of the movies are boring to me. I really enjoyed the flash  arrow  dc legends.. etc... I enjoyed those. but superman is seriously boring.I went into this expecting much of the same and disappointment. but to be honest  this looks pretty sweet. I know nothing about black adam  but this looks good. Imight actually give it a chance.
I didn t know anyone called this movie woke. I just heard trash
sigh if you pause a video while talking should go back at least 2 secs lop you literally spoke an paused as the rock was givijg his short backstory of black adam lop
212th
I just cant get behind the dceu with its current roster of domestic abusers like ah and ezra
I will never watch this dog shit movie. no movie that race swaps a character will ever get my money. I am sick of being erased from my own culture.hawkman is white.deadshot is white.johnny storm is white.nick fury is white.catwoman is white.jim gordon is white.batwoman is white.wally west is white.heimdall is white.ripcord is white.domino is white.the kingpin is white.valkyrie is white.electro is white.jimmy olsen is white.baron mordo is white....and that is just comics.you ve got european fables - ariel.novels - roland.actual people! - anne boleyn. the fucking queen of england!
movie looks really dumb and generic.
dwanye johnson films are generic and forgettable.
your accent sounds increasingly like grace randolph  it is cringy  I really dont want to be reminded of her.
