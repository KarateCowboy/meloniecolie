Ive been burned enough by these kinds of stories that I always ask   ok  what did the media leave out this time   if the story is truly accurate then yes its an overuse of force. but I always find thatsensational stories tend to leave out important details all too often. and I definitely dont trust an outlet like kotaku to have any integrity.
take down  -stop and arrest. were the perps still in their car  a vehicle is considered a deadly weapon  especially if its aimed at the deputies. we need to hold our judgment  especially if the reporting is as biased as this.
Imean pokemon cards are more valuable than the us dollar right now.
local perspective  this is a very murky story. the officers had just finished a training event so they were waring tactical gear but no bodycams and yet the defense is claiming that they didn t know it was the cops. from what I have heard the teens had albeitshort criminal records. I also remember a recent event were this same department faced down known drug cartel members showing incredible restraint. was this out of control teens  suicide by cop or a few deputies overly amped up after a day of tactical training  the florida bureau of investigation will have to determine this  ie. the deputies names remaining concealed .  what ever the truth this article is very biased. Im not sure why kotaku is running this story but they do have some errors  namely it was two suspects aged 18 19 not kids. I also love the way the article stresses the color of the car as if cars have race.
cant see anything wrong here by the police.
this is a win for florida. californian shopkeepers   can we get some of that here
wow  how are these news making out of local news    Im shocked ! thank you for covering this melonie.
I hate how personal responsibility is never a factor  they resisted arrest  had a weapon  ran away  putting the public in danger   you cant let someone like that escape. like buddy stole some pokemon cards  get on your knees  put your hands on your head and accept the misdemeanor  why are you risking your life over petty theft... yeah its the cops fault for you not complying like people need to get over themselves.
that article is bias as heck  even the line  suspicious for wearing hoodies and masks in a global pandemic  shows how disconnected the writer is from the reality of florida. we were never so dystopian.
florida cops open fire on pokemon card shoplifters gotta catch  em all!
from some of the news reports Ive read itsounds like the driver might have tried to run over the officers in an attempt to flee. that could be completely wrong. the investigation is still ongoing so well have to wait for more information to be released.
its so easy to push blame and responsibility when looking in from outside  and while people will often say things could have been different  but the truth is that in the moment things are happening fast and escalation of the situation is faster  anybody can say that they would have done something different  but the truth is that in that moment you dont get time to think and more often than not you will move on reflex an instinct rather than reason
Im gonna  go out on a limb and say this had little to do with shoplifting and more to do with felony resisting.
I agree with your take. kind of made a comment without watching to the end. kotaku articles are hit and miss depending on the author and you already know of their biases. would be nice if there was another source to cross reference missing info or add a bit of a counter to the bias. you do awesome work  I love your channel! really interested to see where tomb raider goes. going to play some of the old school ones once I get over my addiction to pokemon arceus.
here in florida  we take our pokemon seriously.
everyone really feels safe using a taser when the guy is literally taking a swipe at the neck
I used to do karate back in the day and we were always taught that karate is the last line of defence if you can get away getaway the best karate is the karate you dont use at all and its definitely nothing like you see in the movies it is a very disciplined and serious sport I emphasise the word sport.
I wonder if he yelled  thats my pikachu!!!  before he fired lol
pokemon cards are expensive but I d be more pissed with someone stealing my pizza. on a more serious note  kotaku is known for slanted articles and leaving out info.
so  the way this story basically begins is   florida man...  insert rest of video
yeah definitely withholding any judgement until it goes to court or there s video released.
crossed my mind as well
you can immobilize a car by ramming it and boxing it in between squad cars though.
dont feed the trolls.
@seven proxies  true  but if the officer is on foot  also  intentionally hit a police car is considered assault with a deadly weapon.
true
sadly true
noooooooooo its totally true.
sarcasm
she said they didn t have a weapon. they killed a kid for petty theft.
@brian  I was just talking in general  you cant get enough information from an article to break down an excessive force case. video is needed imo before coming to any conclusions. but if he got shot  Im assuming he resisted arrest in some form.
@nessa  resisting arrest isn t generally a good reason to use deadly force but yes we need more information and I dont like this waiting around like the old days where police departments takes their sweet time in releasing body cam footage. they should all be wearing one and should be published asap to the public whenever a shooting happens  if its justified they dont need to worry about anything if its not they need to fire trigger happy clowns.
lol ikr
ash  oh no team rocket is getting away with pikachu!officer jenny  not on my watch! shoots kid
and aggravated assault and attempted murder manslaughter with a vehicle aka black audi... I hate the predatory journalists who gaslight their articles rather than communicating the facts.
yeah I think important information was left out  the kid probably had a weapon of some kind like a lv60 charizard  ain t no way the police would let him summon that beast unhindered. lethal force was necessary.
go gun I choose you!
we take our pokemon cards very seriously here in florida!
the  attempted take down  wasn t  I believe  something  the suspects did. I think it is referring to the police  confronting the suspects. it was talked about around 3 minutes and 20 seconds into the vid.  I write it like thatso I dont have to deal with the time stamp link. 3 20  I wonder how many people know you can press click on that and it takes you to that part of the vid. itsometimes seems like not many know that. oops. I totally screwed that up. its at 2 47. thats why I didn t want to deal with it. its sometimes difficult to nail down the exact time.
poor kid
oh melonie  youre going to get me to act up with some dark humor.it is sad  but this lessens the sting.
I hope the cards are okay
I think its funny when stores post mugshots and the names of people that have been convicted of shoplifting from that particular store. there s just something to be said about the deterrent value of public humiliation.
I live in the vancouver british columbia canada area and I watched a grown man gets stabbed in walmart because he grabbed the last box of pokemon card on the shelf a year ago. the entire thing was filmed by walmart and multiple people in the store. two grown-ass men in jail hospital over pokemon.
okay well I wasn t that bothered by it  perhaps just enough to mention. it was more like hey lovely melanie please dont see us like that rather than  how dare you talk about us like that  lol its cool though no worries. wasn t looking to cancel anybody anyway. keep up the good work
okay  more details from other stories...the two who were thievin  got into a car with two others  and thats when the deputies approached.  so it wasn t pedestrians shot by cops  there was also a car involved  a deadly weapon .  not much information out there.
would like to see a follow up video once all the details are out
although I do like the wavy hair  Ive always been for variety and would like to see the the straight hair return from time to time.  even as a dude  Ive rocked many hairstyles in my day  so I can appreciate the mixup. keep rockin  mel!
tazers often dont work. and as another commenter here said  shooting at the legs doesnt work for several reasons. for one  you could miss and it could ricochet off the ground and hit an innocent party. for another  one could hit the femoral artery and the perp could bleed out  no loss in my book though .
there is a reason we call it  target .
ever since I was a child I knew pokemon was deadly stuff.
I think it was jackie chan thatsaid if someone came at him with a knife in a real fight  his first best move would be to run away  in movies its choreographed and controlled. he would fight if no choice but first option would be to get out of the situation.  so yeah if a martial arts master would run from a knife fight its not trivial
thank goodness Imanaged to escape with my pokemon cards and pizza. they should have used a different strategy  like driving off in a tank. thats not how I got away  I swear!
romans 8 28 is easily one of my favourite Bible verses and one I go back to as a reminder that God is always  always in control - and that is a wonderful thing.one ot equivalent is genesis 50 20 thanks for sharing melonie mac. go boom!
awesome thumbnail  and dont mess with pika-gat  or florida.  I believe the blue was justified because the teen didn t comply if the teen had them the outcome would have likely been different.  martial arts is like the indiana jones scene of a sword vs a gun fight replace sword with martial arts and that would be the same outcome.  shooting someone in the leg  arm or hand is extremely difficult thats why cops go for center mass  .  great verse as always.
I dont get why people think tasers are a sure thing. people fight back or run off after being tased multiple times all the time  especially if they re on drugs.edit  oh  you mentioned it too. well  there we go.
apparently you haven t put out a video in a week or so...watching videos I skipped missed before.hope youre doing well.
all good  thank you for clarifying and sorry for misunderstanding
@melonie mac go boom  no worries  its all cool   to you too
they were in a car attempting to run the officers over. cant  taze  a car.
takedown is where the officer attempts to detain and secure the defendant perpetrator s .
when I was in the navy mp training they showed a video of a man in cuffs sitting in the hospital with a police officer snap the cuffs charged the officer. the officer shot him 5 times 3 in the heart. the guy took the gun from the officer and shot him before he collapsed and died. police dont know if someone is high on something or if they have a weapon. they might of tried a takedown and might of been out matched or it might of been that it looked like he was reaching for something or trying to grab the police gun. without further information dont know what happened.
imagine getting shot over some pokemon cards
dont care how skilled you are  if your opponent is armed they have an advantage. even bruce lee stayed strapped.
I cant believe pok mon cards are still so dangerous....
these things never appears as these people describe  later you find out someone attacked a cop or was non compliant.  you make your mind up reading this only to find out later the story was completely opposite. I have learned to reserve judgement until the full story is released
about martial arts  Ive done kickboxing.  unfortunately mma wasn t popular when I was young.  too old.  so we were fighting standing up.first of all - all real fights end up on the ground.  so most  martial arts  training is useless in such a situation.  mma training is probably better but I wouldn t rely on that if someone potentially had a weapon.
no one under the age of 97 wears a face mask in florida.  play stupid games  when stupid prizes.  end of story.
well  pokemon cards are now a federal offense  so Im ok with the excessive force....
ya when I still see people wearing mask  I do have that thought in the back of my mind they watch main stream news.
melonie this was a aggravated assault and attempted murder manslaughter with a vehicle aka black audI situation... the only reason they would escalate this outside of those perps having weapons themselves.
pokemon and pizza all you need is a ps2 saturday with the homies and your all set.
that ll teach those shoplifters
only if you were wear some brown shorts you would look like the tomb raider. also pokemon cards have been used to dodge taxes as well. its sad someone has died over pokemon cards. but I know the value of some my mtg cards and I could see someone doing something like this over them as well  heck a black lotus card runs  15 000 I think or it did sometime ago. also a taser has a limited range  there is a video where a guy shot with a taser still pointed at someone off screen and said  bitch Im going to get you.
gotta catch em all
dont forget the time it was reported on facebook that a rracist cop had thrown an innocent black man off a bridge. everyone was outraged. then the cops released the bodycam footage. the cop comes back from his car and says  sir  I know your real name and I know you have warrants.  and the guy just takes off  runs across the road and jumps off the bridge. I guess he was expecting water at the bottom. no appologies from the people who had been calling for the cop s head  of course.
I disagree about what you said on training police with martial arts. they need to be trained in jujitsu period. they need to spend time learning how to take someone down safely
them pokemon cards tho
names are held back because the officers are victims because they were attacked. its called marcy s law.
steal a charzard you get the gak.  I thought everyone knew the rules.
might have
most people call it  f around and find out   you call it   heck around and find out   I call it   you are welcome at any time to test that hypothesis .I am military trained  10 years us army  cqb cqc instructor cadre   I studied isshinryu karate  and gojyo jujutsu.  I even teach concealed pistol classes.  I will be the first to say 1. when shooting  you go for the easiest target  center mass.  you must be aware of your target and what is beyond your target.  legs move easier than a torso  thus  you have a higher likelihood to miss  and potentially cause unintended casualties.2. learning martial arts is like having a set of tools.  you can own the tool  even know how to functionally use a tool  but owning and knowing how  is far different than doing construction with the tool.  you can learn all the moves in the world  but in a real world fight  if all you do is know how the technique is done  but have no real world experience in how a technique can be applied  it is like trying to read a book on how to build a house  on beach sand  and never having built anything before  while the book wasn t meant for building on sand.  you will be in the midst of a bad project.I guess that is my 2 pence on self defense.
daamn rockin the lc tank top  im not even hatin
another article said that a witness said the was an exchange of gunfire.
you write things in passive voice to make sure only facts get in the report - not to distance yourself -  I felt angry and got tired of chasing the suspect
cops in the netherlands are trained to aim for the legs...
these people always leave things out. police did exactly what they are supposed to do. but if someone tried stealing my alpha power 9 mtg cards  we re going to have problems.
most valuable pok mon cards  1 pikachu illustrator   900 000   2  1st edition shadowless charizard  399 750   3  blastoise wizards of the coast presentation galaxy star holo   360 000 .   these cards do have value and the above can be extreme examples of their value.  however  the story could be deemed as excessive use of force by police based on the information provided.   I doubt we are getting the whole story.   cops dont as a rule shoot people unless they have no other choice  contrary to some of the media narratives out there.
gotta catch em all
incidentally  great classic lara tanktop today!
hImelonie   geez crime is getting crazy
people seem to not know that the legs contain femoral arteries that when severed can cause a person to bleed out within seconds.  then again  what do I know... Im not a biologist lol
remember when kotaku talked about video games
gotta catch  em all.
cops aim for the torso for the maximum chance of hitting the attacker as it is the largest area. in a life or death situation  you want your shot to count. hitting someone s thin  moving legs is easier said than done.
you got to wonder....... was their any rares in there
as much as you love tomb raider have you considered putting you name in the hat for the next laura croft. I think you would be amazing
I cant believe all these people who think real life is like the movies. if they think they can disarm someone who doesnt want to give up  they will be found doa. if these nerds need a movie reference that really works at stopping a fight  think indiana jones on the guy with the sword in  the temple of doom.  thats how to stop an attack.
than awkward moment when yourealize  this ain t san fransicko.
rocking the classic lara color. love it!
dat charizard worth a small fortune right now.
no
@jedimasta yoda  me neither.
I think that was  raiders   I could be wrong  but I remember it being in a place that looked like egypt. anyway  yeah I always think of thatscene when wokies try to talk about what the police should have done
@sammaklaus  you may be right. it was doom where another guy with a sword showed up  and he didn t have his gun.
Ive heard of accidental bias in media  but this is full of suggestive language and leading statements. Imean  I know its kotaku  but this is like something I wrote in high school when they gave me an assignment to write an objective report on something about which I had an opinion.is kotaku still pretending to employ journalists or is it just a group blog at this point
kotaku is a dumpster fire  I wouldn t believe a single thing they wrote  even true things become lies once published in kotaku.
a screwdriver is deadly. in my old town somebody got murdered with a screwdriver. legs have major arteries anyway....
everyone is a professional cop and marksman behind their keyboards.shooting at someone s legs could result in a miss and a ricochet that could kill an innocent bystander.if they did tase the guy with the screwdriver and he fell on it and stabbed himself then all these know it all s would be complaining that they used a taser on him.
lara croft is chilling in the background
theft is a violation of your rights  they forfeited theirs when violating yours. I know this may sound mean or wrong but thats a discussion for the individuals involved and God.
speaking as a former retail worker  justified. shoplifters destroy social trust. Im all for hanging the flayed and tanned skins of shoplifters from a post outside the shop. it would cut repeat offending to zero. shoplifters will be added to the awning.
pokemon cards and pizza  seems like those thieves wouldve had a fun sleep over with the bros that night if the cops hadn t got to them first.  probably had the soda  movies and pillow fort all set up and waiting at home with mommy too. poor old gal. instead of hearing the wholesome giggles of hardened criminals playing childrens card games and watching the newest pokemon movies all night she gets to hear police officers grill her for information.
makes me wonder about their upbringing with their parents or lack thereof one in their life. I think shooting as what I know now seems excessive but on the other hand hopefully this incident will make others think twice about shoplifting. unarmed shoplifters who aren t putting other lives in danger shouldn t be shot but hopefully they pause and think it is not really worth taking the chance where they nothing bad will happen. in this case itseems like those kids might have lost a friend due to their bad decision to go shoplifting.
what the article briefly covers is they were in a car! cars are deadly weapons.
did they even aim for the legs  spoken by someone who has never fired a weapon and has no clue how to use one. fyI someone running at you with or without a weapon is highly unlikely to be stopped by a shot to the leg. but you are incredibly likely to shoot someone else on accident.
just because a superior officer trusts their deputies  that doesnt mean there isn t a huge flaw with the system in general.
and some people are baffled why there are robberies  things start small. saying that  its just pokemon cards  and pizza   is enabling them a shole thugs to do more crimes. what next  home burglary for them thugs   its just home burglary  excuse  then  its just  insert an act   excuse and I saw the article from a news organization. they used the photo of a  gentle soul  and  innocent looking  thug. the   he is such a good boy  photo. lolz
I dont object to police officers using violence when trying to apprehend an uncooperative suspect. even if the suspect has only stolen pokemon cards  a theft is a theft after all .but I cant condone shooting at unarmed suspects just because they were being uncooperative.shootings should be relegated firmly to situations of self-defense for the police  or if suspects are engaging in unarmed violence and pose a threat to other civilians.just go in there and clobber the bastards with batons  or taze and mace them. risky  yeah  a bit. but as a cop you should be expected to exhibitsome damn courage and not hide behind a gun during every single altercation.
this is getting out of control
hey melonie I just want to say that pokemon cards are not worth to steal for and those cops did a great job of catching the shoplifter but the cops should not have shot the shoplifter in the chest and killed him bc it wouldn t solve any crime that he had committed and there would have not been a happy ending to this story either  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say that killing someone who did a crime is not right and it would not solve any reason of the crime that had committed in florida  ok melonie. anyway I hope you agree with my comment to this topic of the story melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day today and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie. also God bless you melonie.
they keep on doing this revolting shit just to get attention   want to make a name for themselves
vice reports  well now I believe it as much as jussie smollett story
this article sounded hella slanted. I dont trust them so Im gonna go ahead and assume that they re liars.
that is not the jedI way.  my holiday is tomorrow
the shoot them in the leg comment always makes me laugh  because thats a dangerous spot to get shot. lots of major arteries in there that could kill you in minutes if hit. more likely for the cop to hit you in the shoulder when aiming for your core and you ll be fine.  you ll never make them happy  remember the cop thatsaved a black girls life by shooting another... they were upset about that too  like yeah just let the innocent girl get stabbed.... like they have no common sense.
I wasn t there so Im missing crucial information but I think I d rather just let the kid go if I had to choose between killing him and letting him get away with pok mon cards.
@tom foolery  what about personal responsibility though  when the cop approached them all they had to do was stop and get arrested. stealing pokemon cards would only be a small fine. however he resisted to the point where the officer needed to use his gun. there s obviously crucial information missing and we cant be 100  sure  but I still give the cop the benefit of the doubt. the kid didn t get shot because he stole cards  he got shot because he resisted arrest.
@nessa  I dont think resisting arrest warrants the use of a lethal weapon unless the person resisting arrest is an immediate danger to the people in his surroundings  I also think that personal responsibility doesnt fully apply to kids. I will reserve judgement until more information comes out but unless it turns out that the kid had a gun I dont think I could condone the cop shooting at them.
@tom foolery  my whole point is we dont know the whole situation  they resisted to the point the officer thought he was in danger or the public was. we need video evidence that isn t provided. I always give the cop the benefit of the doubt. but again personal responsibility if he didn t resist he d be alive. stop protecting criminals  resisting arrest is a crime.
@nessa  so is littering but I dont think anyone deserves to die for it. I wont reduce another human being to the tag of criminal and just shrug my shoulders when that person is robbed of his life. you go on about personal responsibility but I feel that personal responsibility should also apply to the cop right  if it turns out that the kid wasn t an immediate danger to his surroundings then at least in my opinion the cop was in the wrong for using a lethal weapon.but like I said I will withhold judgement until more information is released.
@tom foolery  if you litter and the cop is writing you a ticket  and you decide to run while pulling out a weapon then yeah. its not the intials crime that warrants violent interaction  its resisting violenting. personal responsibility. the cop does have responsibility to the public. if the person who he let go went and hurt someone else he d be responsible as well. if a cop acts in malpractice that is different and should be held accountable. but you cop haters think every interaction thats violent deems them to be arrested
@nessa   pulling out a weapon  like I said if he was an immediate danger to his surroundings then I understand using a lethal weapon but if not then other options should have been applied.
probably why youre a  former retail worker .
rooftop koreans would concur.
dont worry  at the rate things are going we will be in mad max territory before too long!
killing outside of self-defense against a legitimate threat of deadly force is murder. it doesnt matter how you feel if you should have the right to take someone s life  its if those feelings are justified by events that would certainly lead to your extreme harm or death. saying someone else should die because you think they are out of control or their life is inconvenient to yours is being an accomplice to homicide. this clause of  feelings  is substantiated as more important than the existence of another  and thus granted such persons as a special class which contradicts that all men are equal and the sanctity of life as the same. this is why strange murders occur simply because cops  wanted an easy way to catch the guy.  and the feelings of those accomplices who say  its not me  and I would never do that.  the application of deadly force on a perceived threat that has not committed heinous acts of violence or has brandished a gun  for example  as if to be used  creates the legitimate concern argument that cops are a threat and are the enemy because they have the discretion to exterminate you based on feelings that could be wrong. you cannot then claim to be a civil society while simultaneously expressing the lack of concern for proper discretion to be applied according to the right to bare arms and de-escalation. feelings always get in the way of reality  you dont feel for a person who loses their life unjustified  but you feel for the cop who intentionally murders someone. hippocrates. this being a clause on the sanctity of life rather than specifics of events  more can be said and this is the idea.
actually basedI also used to work retail when I was in college.  Ive seen it all when it comes to shoplifting.  glad those days are in the past.
@thewanderinghelmsman  didn t expect a roof korean reference! gotta watch out for them!
@shade  I agree that death isnt a valid punishment for all but the most worst crimes that only a inhuman monster would commit. I say bring back public humiliation punishments. bringbackthepillary bringbacktossingtomatoes bringbacktarandfeathering
@coomamon  sure  that actually sounds like a great idea. Ive learned that if people dont agree with you  youre probably right.
@shade  sadly thats true way too much. the average iq score is about the range that above average people would assume is below average. basically the smart underestimate just how dumb average person is. usually if the crowd disagrees with you then you either made genius fivehead take or a moronic one that even the biggest dingwing can spot. more often than not the takes that upset the most are ones they didnt fully read into. basically big long comments or articles online that most would refuse to fully read because of tldr mindset and get mad over the first two sentences without understanding of the rest. its why clickbait titles and thumbnails work so well to get people upset and talking but also why good ideas get rallied against so often. all they get is that the thing they like is recieving criticism and get mad.
@coomamon  well put. only thing I would add is that the most insidious complications and lies of society do require more wordy explanations to be consecrated from rhetorical conspiracy  which obviously has created the cycle of reinventing the wheel with terrible ideas  when often times  the answers are throughout history. which is why I pay attention to my peers and remain among all things considered.
@shade  true. big ideas require a lot of words whether they are to help society or hurt it. thats why people need to read things like proposed legislative bills before voting on them. theres a ton of words in them because theres a ton of ideas in such things but not all ideas are good and the corrupt are counting on it not being read when they put something like that out there.
@joseph rosa  former because with experience he probably moved up in life.
@shade  criminal was killed in the commission of a crime  zero sympathy. the solution to avoid this happening to you is simple  can you figure it out
@thewanderinghelmsman  the rooftop koreans were defending their business from being burned down by rioting gangs  not a couple teens stealing pizza and pok mon cards
@jedimasta yoda  the irony of assuming I dont  get it  because you dont  I get that. by responding with that  you are saying all crimes are punishable by death as long as youresist arrest. thats what the court is for  the police are not judge  jury  and executioner. resisting arrest is a crime that is dealt with in court  resisting arrest is not punishable by death  and the fact thatso many of you coddle these weak points your keep using just shows how little you understand about our rights. we are not ruled  we are governed  which means that we are not treated with contempt at their whim. you all create division with your fear mongering just because you like hearing that a thief was killed. a thief can change their ways  and a thief can be nonviolent. do I think hurting a business by stealing physical goods is wrong and punishable  yes  the right way. police dont want do car chases  they just want to shoot people and call it a day. thats not their job and youre basically giving them an out because they no longer want to uphold their integrity  but yet want there to still be a common respect for them when they are operating in disservice if they drop their standards. I understand the cops life is included as valuable  that doesnt mean you indiscriminately shoot people based off of an adrenaline rush that one calls  fear for life.  thats not how  fear for life  works. you still need to provide evidence to justify your mesures. the law applies to the cops too  and its supposed to be a higher standard for them actually  because they are representatives of the law and that doesnt mean being a prick  it means being a model citizen and protector of civilians.
@shade  excellent post. unfortunately  nuance is often thrown out the window during these kinds of discussions.
@lokI trickster g  thanks
by accident
he a good boy. turning his life around. aspiring rapper. gentle giant.
@ucrofr5jj5vxz5_q9xgz3ymw if he was armed  its a different story.I just went by the video and treat the situation as hypothetical.
ok drew
your friend the quartering is looking for good youtubers to sponsor for his new coffee company. use this information as you wish.
just another day in  merica
and nothing of value was lost.
boom!!
darwin award
maybe dont steal pokemon cards  lol
sad they died...but at the same time  I do think shoplifters deserve everything they get coming to them. rooftop koreans  where yo at
12 15 ill add a bit more to that  1  any melee weapon is deadly with 1 inch of penetration  technically even less is deadly  but 1 inch is what it takes for it to be anywhere on the body  a screwdriver  assuming its a  normal  size  is essentially a 4-6 inch long ice pick  1 jab and a jerk and you have caused enough damage to kill 2  any melee weapon within 20 feet of you is worse than a gun that isn t drawn  as in within 20 feet  even someone well trained wont react faster than someone with a melee weapon will get at you. 3  a criminal with a deadly weapon is 100  reason to fire deadly bullets4  tasers are easily lethal depending on where they hit you  they are just the less than lethal option  but you have 2 prongs that need to hitsomeone for it to be effective unless you have the self contained shotgun cartridge version baggy clothing  there is a reason they wear that  it catches prongs and makes it less likely to stick you  even in situations where tasers are used  1 officer points a taser  another officer points a gun for a reason5  if you are going to open fire you shoot to kill  if you  aim for the legs  you are shooting at a shallow angle  its more likely you will miss  and the ricochet is all the more likely to hitsomeone else. you do not fire warning shots  you do not aim to incapacitate  if you hit the leg  you either hit bone which shattered and it hit an artery or more likely hit an artery  they are bleeding out from here we have 2 cases in the us which changed how law enforcement is armed  1 was an fbI shootout where they had 0 stopping power  the fbI  killed  the target  and killed as in he was never going to make it  but because they had no stopping power  they returned fire and lost I think 3 agents. this is when everyone was armed for stopping power  to do as much damage and put them in shock rather than just penetration  the second is the vegas la  I forget which  bank heist where the gunmen had body armor and the cops had 0 way of dealing with them because of that. both are interesting cases that have re enactments made of what went down so give them a watch. and finally  while some cops around the world dont carry as standard  or are more or less fired if they ever think of using the gun they have  I would rather our cops not get broken bones and stabbed in dibiltateing ways and I give near 0 effs about the life of a criminal who refuses to comply  america is a country with 330 million known residence and over the course of a year we get a total of 30 questionable deaths  many still justified  but questionable  while we typically go years in between 100  unjustified one  and this is out of 61 million interactions in a given year. this probably went on a bit long but people like that annoy me quite a bit because they are the ones that hold up 1 bad interaction as the norm  and vilify the correct ones because they care more about a criminal than the cop.
you dont need to remind me
bruh
was itsuper effective
kotaku is a video game rag. why is it reporting on crime. is it capable of reporting on crimee. alot of lack of clarity in the article. what is kotaku s purpose in reporting this. my guess is that they want to bash cops  florida  and pokemon cards
these shoplifters  there s something very perversely wrong with their mental makeup
your light is way too bright
watch out the mwo the melonie world over is taking over and there s nothing anyone can do about it.
wow
gonna shotem all. gungrave I chose youuu

you are such a cutie
florida rules
its not  sad   every time you commit a crime you are putting your life in God s hands. one day the bill will come due. they got what they deserved.
yep steel type is super effective against human type.

man  Imake a comment about melonie s new do about a week ago and john s the one that gets spotlit.  oof.
anybody ever add cheese to broccoli
thats crazy.  its 2022 so not surprised
1047.7 use of deadly force.  5  apprehension. when deadly force reasonably appears to be necessary to apprehend or prevent the escape of a person reasonably believed to   -- y all can lookup the rest.
pokemon card theft -  shootingthere are steps missing.  attempted vehicular homicide   grabbing for the cops  guns   more gaps than content on this story.
I could kill someone with a shoe    a coffee cup   mobile phone    cable cord   game controller   etc   etc.but should all these items be named   weapons
the bias dripping off that disgusting article is shameful.
who let this woman out of the kitchen
biden creates dhs ministry of truth. would be interesting in what you have heard and your thoughts
florida man...sounds like florida needs men to me! call all I see is boy
thats kissimmee  its an area with lots of violent crime. the natives know not to stay in that area too long.
hello  to add more to the stupid comment about shooting someone in the legs and explain why cops are trained for center body  shots.aiming for a limb of the body isn t ideal for life or death situations because 1. its a lot harder to a smaller target thats moving around and might give the person a chance to kill you easier and 2. stray bullets could end up hitting innocent bystanders instead.
they should just bring rpgs. theft  rpg. rape  rpg. murder  rpg. domestic dispute  rpg. jaywalking  rpg.
I dont want to call people out in comments for stuff  but this one dude...  there was no need to shoot bullets at him  yes  there was. he had a screw driver and was rushing at cops. you have a tazer  1  they fail to connect most of the time 2  even when they connect  they dont always work  drugs make people not be affected often   and 3  tazers are still deadly weapons  just less deadly. did they even aim for the legs.  first off  thats a question. end your questions with a question mark  like this  did they even aim for the legs   . second  and much more important  no. because if you aim for the legs  there are major arteries there and the assailant will likely die if you hit and you almost always miss two spindly quickly moving legs compared to a relatively stable center mass shot at the chest  which is also often fatal  but not always .itsucks when people die  but you dont understand law enforcement  nor do you understand life and death fights. not even slightly. thats fine  but please look  up some good unedited bodycam footage of fights and shootouts. really try to put yourself in those situations from the perspective of a leo  and realize you weren t there even if you do roleplay in your head how you might have done it  better.
people in the comments cheering for capital punishment with no trial are being ridiculous. lethal force in any situation other than self defense is unacceptable.
can yourecommend some anime
Im surprised they didn t mention the race of the people shot which means they must have been white.
at 0 24. I hate to criticize the Godesss but that was very awkward. try  were shot at by  next time.
no sympathy. thieves deserve none. those weren t starving people out trying to get something to feed their families. those were scum thieves out to take what they want instead of earning it. they deserve the headsman s axe.
haha  so glad that I live in florida. sucks that a kid got killed over stupid cards  he put himself in that position  not the cops.
this was absolutely self defense  the kid was about to unleash his lv60 charizard ain t no way the police is going to let him summon that beast unhindered. lethal force was necessary

@tom foolery  thank you so much!
they were kids.
those where children  I stole bubblegum once when I was 14 do I deserve capital punishment too
@tom foolery  Ive been burned enough by these kinds of stories that I always ask   ok  what did the media leave out this time   if the story is truly accurate then yes its an overuse of force. but I always find thatsensational stories tend to leave out important details all too often. and I definitely dont trust an outlet like kotaku to have any integrity.
@oldie wan  yeah I think they are leaving info out or framing it a certain way to generate clicks. will have to wait until more info gets released.
nothing to see here. move on.
tazers.... depending on what they re on sometimes a tazer wont do jack crap..... and if the fool is crazy enough to attack an officer he s capable of doing anything.... he could stab a mom and a kid steal their car  high speed chase and run that car into other people and or someone you love....
um not all marshal arts are the same and not all training is the same.  that being said  I d rather have my gun when things go bad.
something is off  if you can afford to drive an audI you can pay for pizza and buy cards....
wow I love pokemon but I wouldn t steal anything it not worth it but the cops did go a little overboard
