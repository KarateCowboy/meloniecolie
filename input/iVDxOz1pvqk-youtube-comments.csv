red sonja is one of my favorite characters. basset did a great job with solomon kane despite having a low budget. it only makes sense for him to do another robert e. howard character. as far as the casting news. I think that is great news as well. they really need to cast a natural red-head in the role. dying someone s hair could work  but there really isn t a reason to do it when you can easily find a natural red-headed person to fill the role.
Im a newer subscriber  but thank you so much for being one of the few sane voices on the internet in a flood of hypocritical  woke  bullies. I know its easy to be discouraged when you get attacked on a daily basis  but you are making a difference. stay feisty  stay outspoken  and continue to push back against all the insanity. thank you melonie!
I ll never understand hollywood s obsession with race swapping  especially red heads. also awesome shirt melonie  line nine apparel is the best.
brigitte nielsen was a fine red sonja imo. sure as an actress she lacked skill  but she brought a natural hostility to the role which fit that character perfectly. I liked her accent and she didn t look bad swinging a sword. guess we ll see what kind of approach they take but its hollywood  which removes 99  of my confidence.
sonja and ariel mean so much to me and seeing them ruined hit hard. really hoping they either fix this  or just cancel it outright
I just watched solomon kane yesterday and I think bassett did a great job with it. I hope that getting the two woke idiots off the project is a sign of good things. red sonja can be a great character under the right script and creative team.
I would love to see a video on good  pre-woke female characters. Im in that weird age group where Imissed out on growing up with characters like classic lara but was grown by the time the wokies came about. actual tomboy representation is hard to find lol keep up the great work
I disagree with your starfire take  but I wouldn t be mad at you for it myself. haha. my take on starfire was why not cast a latina woman whose skin tone is at least close to the more bronze tone starfire has if they didn t want to give her makeup or special fx. people have said thatstarfire s look is based on a puerto rican singer named iris chacon  apparently this is uncomfirmed   but if you look her up  in pics from 1980 when starfire debuted  she looks like starfire. thats all Im asking for  for the casting to look like the character they re portraying. just my thoughts.
red sonja is such a great character of howard s. I hope this is the good news a lot of people think it is  because I have not been confident at all in any of hollywood s productions. its why I d rather any ip I produce get the anime treatment rather than the netflix treatment. japanese studios respect the source material. western studios respect the ideology du jour.
starfire is orange alien... they could have gone with that  and nobody would had issues wit the actresses race.. but they did went with the version we got... so.. I did not mind zoe salda a being gamora  cuz the character is green and she is green...
ooh I remember red sonja in the 80s  was one of my favorite movies along with big trouble in little china and enemy mine. hopefully they do a decent remake.
idk exactly what it is.... but damn you are such a refreshing addition to my regular viewing melonie... please do not stop your topic discussions have been so entertaining!
so Im a massive red sonja  fan she is like my second favorite comic character next to spider-man. when I heard that they cast her I didn t really mind it but when I heard who was directing it I got worried. knowing now we are getting the solomon kane director someone with a sword and sorcery track record I am so hyped. personally I think karen gillian could be an awesome choice but who ever they cast needs to have the presence of a femme fatale.
wow  did you just recommend dorohedoro  elevated taste indeed.it blew my mind! instantly likeable and full of personality thanks to a finely character-driven plot  with a peculiar mix of happy go lucky  dark fantasy  horror  mystery and choreographed brutality. the author is a female mangaka btw. here s to hoping more anime episodes will be produced.
haha. the first 15 episodes of sao season 1 was an amazing story. I loved the love story there too. but for other anime  I liked code geass. cowboy bebop is classic... I can never think of good anime on the spot   does research   oh! hunter hunter is really good  written hunter   hunter ! I also like gundam  I recently watched classic gundam  with amuro ray   but I also liked gundam seed and g gundam  on tv when I was a kid  haha  . avatar  the last airbender  which isn t technically anime  but definitely anime-inspired  is also really good if you ve somehow missed that.
as far as an anime suggestion I would go with  arifureta from commonplace to world s strongest   it has some romance  captures the situational humor of full metal alchemist while having a similar industrial age technology meets magic feel for its setting. it is available subbed and dubbed  and season 2 is in production. I try to watch all of your content on rumble  but came here to post this and the red sonja trivia  as this site currently gets more traffic.
all acting is pretending to be someone you are not. I dont mind if the actor doesnt look like the character as long as they have the talent to portray the character accurately. I dont get bogged down in appearances. with that being said  if you do have someone perfect for a role  e.g. karen gillan  then you d be stupid not to use them. thank you for creating this space melonie and sharing your thoughts.
we ve got jean grey coming soon in the mcu.das rite!
red sonja is beautiful because she was strong physically  mentally  emotionally  and in her actions. not just purely because of physical beauty alone. I hope they settle on an actress that can carry the role in the way linda hamilton did with sarah connor in terminator 2  modern politics aside . red sonja is one of many examples of women in pop culture being portrayed positively  strong  and independent prior to the year 2018  leftists think it only is just happening now . she was created in the late 1970 s comic the savage sword of conan by author roy thomas  artist barry windsor smith  and is an amalgamation of 2 vague characters from stories  non conan related but one was named red sonja  written by the original conan the barbarian creator author robert e. howard in the early 1930s. roy thomas wrote the screenplay for conan the destroyer and consulted briefly on the original red sonja movie  I believe . I hope he is consulted for the new movie for character traits  but he is getting up there at around 80 years old.
this whole day and age of slapping a beloved name on an original story  and using franchise staples as window dressing  needs to end as soon as humanly possible. when it comes to being a fan  these are definitely the dark ages.
I wouldn t be surprized if they remade it with a blue haired sjw and called it blue sonja with pronouns in the title.
thats very true and even if they did in this case they still could have given her a red head wig for Gods sake !!!!
@d clinton  you dont have to have a white red head . the elves in  Lord of the rings all had blonde haired wigs  or many of them . brigitte neilson who played the original red sonja had her hair dyed . could could easily get a brunette and dye her hair or blonde haired even could have her hair dyed . race swapping doesnt make sense definitely in this case . they haven t eece swapped conan the barbarian yet .
they are just saying there are no audience for actual black characters and stories.
never hire a dyslexic casting agent
also known as  white erasure
not enough red heads are showing up.to casting or aren t available
with this trend  Imight look the other way if amber heard as mera in the next aquaman film gets raceswapped.
@clitorim  project  requires a gingerdyslexic casting agent  rearranges letters of  ginger us
I thought her acting was good its just the script and directing were trash.
I thought she was great in that movie.
I respectfully disagree. her acting was so wooden  you could ve put her in front of a cigar store.
I get you  the little mermaid and the  red sonja  movie mean so much for me.
xd
well to be fair  they didn t even make beast boy green  because they were trying to go for a  realistic  take or so Ive heard  so thats why starfire wasn t orange.
@comrade shadowkat   so thats why starfire wasn t orange.  she s an alien  she has to be orange  it doesnt stop it from being realistic.
no  orange doesnt do well on screen. green does. in no iteration would starfire had been able to be done correctly without it being too costly
do youreally think they can get someone like brigitte nielson to replace her .she was a 6ft 4 danish supermodel and strong as well
sadly people appear so starved for new content they have begun to accept things which would not have flown in the past. kids though  know no better and will consume what ever is put in front of them.
karen would be perfect as sonja  she is funny in the new jumanjImovies    red sonja is as badass as conan the barbarian  would love to see a crossover movie in the future    I still hope we get a king conan movie either with arnold or a new actor in the future.
I think a good choice for red sonja would be that russian woman from kick-ass 2  she s got the look if you add red hair. Im a bit old school when it comes to anime  but I cant recommend gunsmith cats enough. girls  guns and cars what more do you want
I love red sonja. Ive been collecting the comics for a long time. they better not f this up.  full disclosure  making this comment just seeing the thumbnail lol
its amazing how much social media can be used for a positive thing knowing how poisonous it can be nowadays. and bringing someone back to God is  1. God bless you sister.
youre right its either you follow the script the wokies have written for you or suffer. and youre missing out on soa so many good moments in there yeah its romancey but it helps the story they are telling.
going to suggest an old school anime.record of lodoss war  both the ova and tv series chronicles of the heroic knight.there is also heroic legend of arslan  the anime based off a novel written by yoshikI tanaka. who also wrote the novel legend of the galactic heroes.yeah  this guy writes big epics.
this makes me happy mostly as a sonja fan with the comics and conan nothing about the reboot sounded great and they were going to do gail simones run if I recall... now maybe... just maybe could get a decent one.
I saw rose mccowan in the conan reboot and always thought she should play red sonja
funny  since I found your new channel  Ive watched more of your videos than I have before  and Ive been following your other channel for years. the new format is fantastic.
the lady from jumanjI would be almost perfect  she s also got that tough style that you need for red sonja.
yes!!!!!!!! this pissed me off beyond measure    red sonja should be a red head  whether they find a natural red head or dye a white girl s hair  I dont care  as depicted in the comics  it makes no sense to race swap her.
I love the fact how the original conan the barbarian and red sonja movies have all the  representation  wokies say they want but they still will be blind to it.
amazing content as usual keep up the good work.
I agree karen gilliam would have been a good  cast. and just fyI  you know they are going to dye her hair red for the show right
in response to animes to watch. gun gale online alternative is on hulu I think  and on netflix Ive recently watched demonslayer  and hunter x hunter. loved them both.
hey melonie can you do a video on the g4 stuff thats been happening  it would be interesting to hear your thoughts on it. amazing how they went from crying about sexism to having some twitch streamer in a bikinI on their show in less then 2 months lol
the perfect match for red sonja is rose leslie she plays ygritte in game of throne and is very much a red sonja charater already
love the shirt  mel! looks great on you and itsuits you! you are most def a rebel and a lion. 2 11 explain yourself young lady! I am sick and tired of ginger characters getting recast  it is deliberate  they do it all the time and then have the nerve to not even have the actors actresses dye their hair or wear a wig.
very strange indeed how they re mostly race swapping redheads nowadays. for anime I love sao  all 3 seasons and gun gale online   darling in the franxx is an awesome mech style anime inspired by evangelion. others I would highly recommend are the rising of the shield hero  cautious hero and that time I got reincarnated as a slime.
I agree.  making red sonya a woman of color is like making black panther a red head.  its just strange.  however... I dont like it when people say  make your own characters.    your own  creates separation in a way I dont like and it actually does seem a little prejudiced.  what we should be saying is  make new compelling  diverse characters. .  why   because I want to feel ownership of a new compelling diverse character played by a minority in the same way I hope others will respect and feel ownership of a character I already like who is not played by a minority.  I realize that they are saying  you  to the woke writers and not the actual people of different races... but its a terrible way to make a point.
haha. I love the honesty!
oh cool  you like slime  its a bit of a treat for me to see someone like it because I tend to see a hmm lot of dislike  towards it for being slow and boring.
@comrade shadowkat  you know people who think its  slow and boring    lol did they watch the same anime  its one of the highest rated anime this season. what s more  everyone I know who s seen it  loves it. of course liking or disliking something is subjective.. not everyone has good taste like us.
shes also white  mostly white so there s no race swap
hope you got the chance to see the final trailer for sonic 2  lov to hear your opinion on it.
also...thoughts on samus aran from the metroid series   never mind they did her wrong with metroid other m.
damn how I love busty badass curvaceous bikinI armour clad 80s  sword axe wielding vixins from heavy metal  red sonja to conan from the 80s-90s winning over hearts n minds of every red-blooded boy.
Imiss going to see movies at the theater. the theater is open again  showing movie again  and I have lots of free time...but the reason I have lots of free time is I keep my schedule open to help friends and fam in the neighborhood... so Im perpetually broke. I spend half my birthday and xmas gift money that mom sends me on my food  dog food   gas and bills. but Im sorta enjoying my life a lot too right now.
I dont really care for race gender-swapping  I tend to like things as close to the source material as possible  its why I dont like it when they suddenly make batman a killer when he s not  but its not exactly something that bothers me at the same time.so long as the writing is good  the acting enjoyable then I dont really mind the changes much  but if the writing was bad and whatnot then that just tells me what they really cared about and it wasn t the comic nor character they were making the movie of.
hey melonie!any chance you might do longer form videos discussing scripture in more detail love the videos  keep up the great work   God bless!
very random but Im so glad I randomly got your channel recommended to me a few days ago  keep up the great videos !
krista kosonen should play sonja. watch the show  beforeigners  and you ll understand why
I want an actual red sonya story with her back as her original red-haired fiery gun-slinging warrior woman of polish-ukrainian origin.
waiting for the live action brave film from disney with marida being played by letitia wright
bringing the director that did solomon kane is good news.
@d lo  if you like fullmetal alchemist  particularly brotherhood   watch attack on titan. there are parallels between the two that only become apparent in the final season. it is quite the ride!if you like sword art online  check out accel world. also written by rekI kawahara and supposedly set in the same world  but several years  maybe twenty   in the future. grimgar fantasy is another good one  and I think its getting a second season at some point.
for fma recommendations --- assuming you haven t already done both series  original and brotherhood  with their movies  -- perhaps trigun  its shorter by a lot  and ignore the film  which was trash . for more of a mix of genres  like fma  perhaps code geass.
hannah was great in killjoys  but gingercide is real!
love hannah john-kamen from killjoy.  this is a weird casting choice
for anime I would recommend berserk and claymore.
a lot of newer tv shows seem to be afraid of sticking to source material and even more so with creating an original idea. no wonder we see comments like  here s what we fixed that the og creator got wrong   and pointing out thier bs just gets them foaming at the mouth. its sad and makes it look like the entertainment industry only cares about looks and optics instead of quality of content.
yay  macdrop.... happy to see you on simpcast again last night. I wish I could of hung out longer lol.
please can someone produce a reboot that doesnt destroy my childhood memories
I want to see toby mcguire play shaka zulu.
dont toy with me miss nagatoro!  no dub
perhaps witch hunter robin   wolfs reign though it is fairly depressing. inuyasha is a fairly enjoyable series though almost a romantic comedy at times.
nice video mm. keep up the great content.
solomon kane its one of my favorite movies. is in my top 5. Ive watched it like 20 times
commenting to feed the algorithm .   and  yeah I agree karen would have been a good choice.  alos  I liked titans starfire too.
hannah john-karrmen made her bones on killjoys if anyone is out of the  genre-loop
how about netflix and their witcher casting  just about all of the main characters aside from geralt  vessemir   cirI were miscast  ignoring the in-lore descriptions for the most part. triss didn t even have chestnut or red hair in season 1 ffs. at least yen looked the part. now Im not knocking any of the actors  performances  I think everyone did great. but the showrunners kind of disrespected the lore quite a bit  not nearly as bad at the rings of power are going to be though. thats just a train wreck.
the rising of the shield hero  is a great anime
gillan was terrific in gunpowder milkshake and  of course  the mcu movies. she d make a killer sonya.
hey mel dunno how up to date you were with the whole g4tv fiasco but the recent developments involving g4tv are hilarious. they went from full on woke to having amouranth in a bikinI and 4 virtual youtubers in a show    an epic display of hypocrisy  might be worth looking into it  you might have a blast poking some fun into that if you were up to date with the whole g4tv scandal    cheers and keep up the good work!
karen gillan should play red sonja.
check out mushoku tensei. it is a great show. character driven and the animation is beautiful.
I love red sonja   I dont read super hero comics anymore but I love stuff by dynamite but if they make this woke  ill be pissed.
and karen gillian I think does so well in her movies. I liked gunpowder milkshake among other stuff...
in titans  starfire  is not starfire. they could ve painted her skin to be alien-like  but instead they were lazy. they dont even write her anything like starfire which is always the worst part.what is even the point in using these character s names if youre going to botch the look  personality  and everything else that defined the character  I dont want to see some random rip-off  I want to see the actual character I knew and liked. the only reason I am a fan in the first place.I am so sick of  reimagined  characters. thats just another way of saying  another person with a vague resemblance . this is why most american stuff sucks. they wont let things end  they milk it until you cant recognize it anymore. they dont stop until its so terrible they cant keep it going.
new watcher melonie. thank chrissy for introducing you to me  but I watch you more now. excellent show. upload to rumble daily please  as I am subscribed to your channel on there but wont on youtube. trying to leave youtube alltogether
haven t been to church in 10 years  but honesty the verse of the day is why I keep watching.
color blind casting is perfect so long as the character does not have a pre-established appearance or a plot driven reason why they need to be cast a certain color. plot can also mean setting  and historical accuracy is also important to consider for some films. no one batted an eye when james earl jones was cast to play thulsa doom  or when samuel l. jackson was cast to play nick fury. the problem comes up in stuff like red sonja when they try to cast color-consciously for no reason. its not progressive to delete the representation of one group of people and replace it with another. there s no reason to challenge the pre-established appearance of the character. its not even that people are upset because a poc was cast to play sonja  there are problems with that too  but foremost you cant cast consciously to try and spread a message that isn t there. there s nothing to be said by making red sonja look different except so the director can give themselves an unwarranted  self-righteous pat on the back while simultaneously achieving nothing. if you want to make a difference with color-conscious casting then the role itself needs to say something about race  not just redundantly intrude upon a characters design. color-conscious casting is a lot more appropriate for historical or social roles  like deliberately casting Jesus or a police officer as a poc.
they need to get one of those women who compete in those fitness competitions some of those women are hot and have amazing strong bodies
this is very good turn of events if its true. I like hj-k just fine but not as a red sonja.
I d like to see you do a video about regina from dino crisis 1   2.
that is an interesting concept. if they stopped the shows once they re out of story to tell  they could revive it later when they ve thought of more story. the audience would be hyped if done well. maybe the money still doesnt add up
day 14 of commenting on your videos till g fuel sponsors me.in regards to thatsuper nice comment you got about helping someone refind their faith. tbh I really enjoy the verse at the end. Im pretty lost spiritually at this moment in my life and idk but I definitely look forward to hearing them every day. please keep it up  its a very nice touch
some melonie mac before bed is always a good thing  I cant help it you are visually aesthetic. keep going and dont let the woke mob ruin your walk with Christ  never take the easy way out.
dont forget one of the greatest anime s of all time toradora!
it cant be worse than the original red sonja. I like barbarian movies  some of the conan rip-offs are very entertaining. but brigitte nielsen was so wooden  you could ve put her in front of a cigar store.if you hearken back to robert e. howard s short story about the character  she was a slavic ottoman era swashbuckler. the comic made her into conan the barbarian s contemporary and morphed her into a hyrkanian  a member of a race of fierce steppe horsemen  think turkics  mongols  tatars  cossacks  etc. . so a tall  ginger actress with slavic features would still work. and I d bet my left nut that the replacement of redheads is a hollyweird inside joke.
if the actress insists on wearing the chain mail bikinI  she would gain my respect as an actor and I would be fine with her playing the role  so long as she dyes her hair red . that being said  there are like several dozen red headed actresses including karen gillan who should have been up for this role.
melonie I happened across your channel by accident and I think its awesome that you do a Bible verse of the day. Im an old fart and you give me hope that the wokies aren t going to win.  stay true to your faith.
the problem with the starfire casting was they didn t bother to change her skin color to orange  which is a huge part of the problem.
red sonja is supposed to be caucasian. robert e howard was specific about her looks and heritage.
solomon kane is my favorite character. he actually inspired me to become a Christian.people need to stop telling me fictional characters can influence non fictional change.
well original red sonya was polish-ukrainian while marvels red sonja was from western hyrkanian basically eurasia in our world appearing persian. this actress looks the part
Im native american and only want to see a tall  lovely redhead white woman as red sonja  because I read the conan books. the solomon kane movie was well done though I felt he should have worn that distinctive  puritan  hat more. purefoy is a great actor  see him as marc antony in hbo s rome.
a part of me suspects that the fan casting for karen gillan is partly motivated by seeing her in the classic outfitnot that I am really complaining mind. it is a very understandable motiveI prefer bridget reagan anyways
rip redheads in hollywood.  even a young julianne moore couldn t get a role in a cape movie to save her life if she was in hollywoke now.
pushing towards 30k... keep up the good work! God bless!
love the movie  also redheaded people  is a mutation and beautiful one though
again  karen gillan  another example of a real woman that is both strong and feminine. hello lara croft.
haha. youre rockin  the ff vibe well!
dont forget black clover. check out sabikuI bisco  its a new series. - this was in response to the person looking for some animes like fullmetal alchemist.
I d like to see thatstrong female character video that commenter suggested.
karen gillan could be good and I loved her in doctor who  but she s currently filming for guardians of the galaxy 3. Im not sure she could pull off the seasoned warrior look.how about katheryn winnick - she was in vikings so she can look like a warrior and knows how to play the part. and she has a black belt in karate so should be no stranger to action scenes. I think she d do the red sonja role justice  even at age 44  but perhaps the story needs a younger woman.
no  roberts created red sonya  red sonja is inspired by her. he didn t create her. also she is eurasian which this actress is half european
in katheryn s own words about her role in vikings  which ended in 2020  many  many times I got hurt on vikings and my body definitely has the scars  to prove it . my fingers have been hitso many times with a sword or shield that my knuckles are definitely different than they were seven years ago before I came into vikings. I refuse to have a stand-in  and I did all my own stunts. every time you see lagertha on screen  its me. it was an extremely tough show  but I gave it my all and I worked really hard and I dont think I would have had it any other way. I think thats one of the things that made itso successful.
just get brigitte nielson some ensure and call it a day!
hahaha I like your new channel.....you have more drive  passion  energy than anyone I know.....Im still waiting for you to tell me you hate me for upping the workout intensity...lol
oh hey  a nine line shirt. I have two of those!  not that one in particular  but
I agree that karen gillan would have been a great choice for red sonia. sure  she was dr. who in the most recent woke version of the show  but she was great in jumanji.
justiceforredheads
I ll only accept katheryn winnick as sonja!
authenticity is the bane of wokeness.
whoever they hire to play red sonja  needs to be very athletically built with bulk on muscles.
the race of starfire s actor doesnt matter at all  but the character is orange. one of the few orange-skinned characters in pop culture. just like mystique is blue and gamora is green. now that I think about it  hannah-john kamen would be a good choice for starfire.
hey good morning mel. anyway I just want to tell you that there was a lady who play black widow in those marvel movies and she had red hair and also there was a lady in the jammongImovies too that had red hair too and so I just want to tell you that they need to have more ladies with red hair in every action movies  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that bout this topic of ladies with red hair  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home with your pets and at the gym today  ok mel.
if you like fma then check out yojou senkI  aka saga of evil tanya .if you like sao then check out the .hack franchise. its less action oriented and more slow burn mystery drama. Im watching hunter x hunter right now and Im very invested
yeah you got me riled up with thatstarfire take. lol. her casting is just tokenization. which is by far incredibly racist. I really like who plays starfire though. think she is a really good actress. but starfire is freaking orange for crying out loud. not white  black  purple  green etc. keep up the great work though melonie. love your content.
I ordered one these shirts and the hat as well.
drunk3po is a legend. hail!
the name red sonja was because she had red hair and her name was sonja...lol
I remembered a time when race or gender swapping was few and far in between and we were able to roll with those punches. for example  samuel l jackson as nick fury all the way back in the first iron man. now  it is blatant  obvious  and happens way too often to the point that it is insulting. it really needs to stop.
hopefully it will be better. red sonja must be a redhead and must have the iconic bikinI armor period.
10 52 all normal ppl want it11 07 - 12 16 sad reality
I loved the show titans  the casting for all of the characters were spot on except for starfire. I didnt hate the casting of starfire but it was a bit off.great anime  fate stay night  rin and high school of the dead.
Imight be mistaken but I think youngrippa59 made this prediction about race swapping red sonja. this is just ridiculous at this point.
do you know why brigitte neilson got the role of red sonja   she is a 6ft 4 danish woman   back then she was like a supermodel .and the original movie also had arnold schwarzenegger in the movie as well   correct me if Im wrong . some time since I saw the original . the bottom line is schwarzenegger and nielson were icons as they had the very strong germanic look   hence conan the barbarian . actors now are too camp for such roles . those previous movies were great . the rock would have played an excellent conan   and as for red sonja I cant think of really tough woman to play this role
disagree on that one
no.
also the  gingercide is real
good suggestion with tanya the evil!
I like your tattoos and hot takes on stuff. keep it up!
shout out to  drunk3p0  for giving sista melonie new cloths  like every video wifebeater  wifebeater etc thank u jay   melonie loving your content  dont watch tv  or movies these days so I appreciate the content  God bless   stay safe
at least we still have femshep..
I d rather see a red sonja movie actually based on robert e. howard s story  the shadow of the vulture . I was never really keen on the comic version of the character.
to the person who is wanting anime check out overLord it is about getting trapped in vr and season 4 is set to come  out this year
angel beats is another good anime.
like your videos you got a good head on your shoulders. you should go on fnt or gng s main event. as for the animes just go for the king.  watch our read one piece.
paul w.s anderson needs direct a red sonja movie and cast his wife mila jovovich as red sonja
there is never a good reason to race swap an established character.
I like the starfire on titans overall Im against the whole race swapping though
being a Christian  more center politically  and a causal gamer. your channel is a good watch.I am not bent out of shape about race swapping. but certain characters shouldn t be race swapped based on their origins.
what!  you liked the new starfire!  ... shrug  okay. you have your own opinions on things and thats fine. I dont have a problem if you dont have the same opinion as I do on a topic  and I imagine most here are the same. thats just part of living in a society. learning live with and accept  or at least tolerate  others despite our differences. as a side note  if you d like an example of tolerance I would recommend south park s episode the death camp of tolerance. its even more relevant today than it was when it was released almost 20 years ago.....now I feel old.
love thatshirt!
I dont think karen gillan is right for the role either. she may be a natural redhead  but she is just not physically imposing enough. she was pretty intense as nebula  but that was due to the face paint and prosthetics  which she wouldn t have as sonja. rachel nichols is 5 10  and adrianne palickI is 5 11  both played redheads in the gI joe series  scarlett and lady jaye respectively. either of those ladies could pull of red sonya.
alexandra daddario with red hair would be great as red sonja.
I think they should change her name to poc sonja or mixed-race sonja. diversity sonja  representation sonja  how about instead of red hair  she has blue hair and wears glasses and instead of being tall and muscular  she s kind of short and round  I think that would be both stunning and brave.
with everything coming out of hollywood Im not going to hold out hope for a  not  red sonja.  stopgingerhate on the comments. I would like to hear the thoughts on strong female characters vid. mainly because 5  10 15  years ago there were strong female heroes but they didn t have to be woke  manly  to be strong.
I just saw the title of the vid and I knew it instantly. lemme guess  black sonja. there s literally no way they ll respect redheads ever again... I dont know if Im becoming enraged or just sad.
wow .  its like my brain is a tree  and youre one of those little cookie elves!
for the person who wanted anime recommendations.  I would say the gate rise of the shield hero.  so I got reincarnated as a spider so why.
fnt on the 25th
@melonie mac go boom  hell yeah.  cant wait.  keep up the good work.
@t.o t.o  Im sure its fine. Im probably just extra critical because of hollywood s recent track record.
karen gillan would be perfect!!
I would rather stick with classic comics   the movie  thank you very much
serious question... how the hell are you in your 30 s and look like early 20 s  btw love the channel
6 3  195 muscular  martial arts trained. I hear God s revealed word...I crumble. thx for sharing.
they ll find a way to ruin her
I never thought sexyness feminity and faith Bible verse would be a good combo. wow. loving God word without a guilt.  d
if you want to understand the wokies and why they are so crazy  go look up james lyndsay on new discourses channel where he does a 5 part series on critical race theory.
for me  a ginger  nI think there s more to the character than the hair. needs to have xena vibes  gina carano in a wig would be better. sonja is beautiful but strong  she hangs with conan ffs. love the channel!
they replace her with an even worse fit  you ll see. besides  most women who would fit the character aren t even actors  brigitte nielsen wasn t one either.
get an actress that look like the character
I dont think that they would do a good red sonja movie  the same way that they didn t do a good conan movie - I know that the schwarzenegger movie was nice  but was very different from the conan that robert e howard wrote - the conan universe is so raw  violent and masculine that these woke writes would never pull of something great out of it.
I really wish they d stop casting hannah john-kamen in things  especially when she s not suited for the part. outside of killjoys she hasn t really been good in much of really anything she s been in. she doesnt fit any of the roles shes in. I think she d be better off getting cast to original characters closer to her acting range then shoehorning her into characters to check a box. imean look at this casting list resident evil welcome to racoon city - jill valentine..... doesnt act like joy  or cant act like jill   doesnt sound like jill  isn t built like jill  looks nothing like jill. why is she playing jill.ant-man and the wast - ava  ghostnot sure what was going on here. bad acting  bad directing  bad script  or a bad combination of all three. genuinely the least likable part of that movie.tomb raider - sophienope  not sophie. not any of the sophie  sofia  or any variation of. star wars the force awakenscrap movie  but even there she seemed completely out of place an unnatural in thatscene.her list of credits are equally dubious. she s either not given the opportuinity to truly shine or is just constantly horribly miss cast in failing projects that are desperate to fill a part.this isn t promising for red sonja if she is indeed cast. probably means no one else wants the part and she s desparate for a role. she needs to fire her agent.I just want to say she might have some potential. she certanly isn t horrifying to look at and she has an excellent voice that could be put to good use in games. something is off here. I ll go out on a limb here killjoys isn t a very good show either and I wish syfy kept dark matter instead.
karen gillen is a perfect angela  but id accept red sonja  d
coming from redheads on one side and blacks on the other  it really bugs me when I hear about red heads getting raceswapped for a fellow light-skin. I always think  why is hollywood pitting my people against each other   I want to see quality roles for both  not redheads getting their iconic roles taken away and black people getting sloppy seconds while their cool  longstanding characters continue to not get their time in the spotlight.
brigitte nielsen  red sonja 1985  wasn t a redhead either.
I dont think casting directors ever look at the source material. dont get me wrong. hugh jackman was a great wolverine  but he s over 6 ft tall. wolverine is supposed to be short  5 2 or 5 4.
I hope she s a physically fit and attractive red-headed woman. I dont care what race she is  so long as she looks and acts the part. I remember  growing up in the  80s  they beat this idea - that everyone is equal and we shouldn t see race - into our heads  constantly.  by the time I graduated high school  it had become so ingrained that I now notice a person s race about as much as I notice the color of their hair - which is to say  it is neither the first nor most important thing I think of when meeting someone.  now  they re bringing racism back into vogue and the people who demanded I not see race are  instead  telling me that not being a bigot makes me a racist.
she would ve been good as jill but damn the script fucked her over. also the costume for hanna s jill was so bad too
most differences in race are only skeletal  unless youre looking at a dead person s skeleton everyone looks the same. with few visual differences with the living. different distance between the eyes  nose  eye color  hair color  abundance of hair lack of hair. those are universal not tied to one race.
not a ginger  but how about katheryn winnick  vikings  as red sonja
@neroredfield  in your opinion fine  my opinion is yes
makeup
first part is herehttps   youtu.be bed_d6hc6tu
just say u hate her and dont wsnt her to work geeze
@t.o t.o  how about I just say I dont want you to post instead.
for real. where the hell is my static shock movie tv series
@backstabmacro  or the john stewart green lantern   he was the gl that made the most sense. kyle is a clown  gardener is an idiot and jordan was an arrogant prick.  none of those traits make for strong willpower.  being an asshole     strong will.  they do lend to lack of fear though.  except for kyle.  never liked that requirement.
@thatharvguy   Jesus fucking Christ
let s not be stupid.
dude  its a comic book. its fantasy. are you mad the actors playing nightcrawler and beast weren t really blue  dont be that nerd. being short wasn t really an intricate part of wolverine s character like say tyrion lannister.
@static charm  if you dont think being short was part of wolverine s character  you ve never read wolverine.
red sonja as a matter of principle  needs to be a stupid hot  busty  redhead that looks like she can ka   tn.also. strong females that are from days past  ripley. selene from underworld. trinity from the matrix. in games  chun li. sonya. ayane yacoby  israelI sniper in rainbow six . taki. liara t soni. miranda lawson. moreigan. bastilla shan  even though she was annoying and easily replaced with canderous ordo and hk-47 .I could go on and on...
I know is a pay day and the exposure is probably good  but I wish they had enough integrity to not be in these shitty remakes
oh  thats interesting. that last name   huo  looks chinese. the chinese way to pronounce it would be like  who-uh  but said like its one syllable.
getting karen gillian to play red sonja wouldn t work - she s too old  short  and doesnt have the barbarian body to pull it off.  sonja was tall  powerfully built  and young.  brigitte nielsen had two of three and she was able to meet the character image.  red sonja being a redhead was only one of the aspects about her.  thatshe could tear you limb from limb was a major thing that added to her appeal - beauty and brawn  as they ve done everything they canto eliminate gorgeous  built redheads from hollywood  they re going to find it nigh impossible to cast her correctly without appropriation.  you cant just get any old ginger to play her - you need a fairly exceptional ginger to play her  otherwise it just wont work.
another ginger was killed. I knew it even after reading the title.
God is in everyone  he doesnt check boxes ! he ll only judge you on who you ve bin and how you treated others ! sadly in todays world its all about checking boxes ! just be who you are and be the best person you can be ! treat people with respect  dignity and dont enforce your views upon others ! thats all God ever wanted. all the rules that have bin made  are all man made since ages ago.
the main actress does not strike me as the red sonja we are used to.    why is it that these low budget movies are always being race swapped.    a movie being race swapped is already a bad sign.  that means the movie wont entertain but its more focused on getting on a high horse.  why are red headed people always being race swapped     directors cant write strong women.  the fact a woman is strong doesnt mean she has short hair  is pissed all the time and looks masculine.   dying the hair of a dark woman to pass her as a white character doesnt work because the features dont add up.  I would recast the character completely.  there s nothing racist about a character being white.    hollywood race swaps characters because they dont want invest in making original ones.  we ve all noticed.
go boom all!!!
Ive honestly always though that idris elba would be a perfect choice for james bond.
gooo boom!
I had originally dismissed the red sonja movie because I thought all the woke crap was gonna ruin  but hearing that the same guy who directed solomon kane is in charge  has me excited to see this movie.
actors who take on the role of a race-swapped character have no integrity. isn t it bad enough that kamen already ruined jill valentine in that joke of a new resident evil movie  now she wants to play a race-swapped red sonja too  hollywoke cantake this crap and hove it. just another new movie to add to my ever growing blacklist of things to avoid. its easy to say that we shouldn t blame the actors for this stuff because its the people making the movie or tv show doing it  but remember these actors are agreeing to these roles  so in my honest opinion they are part of the problem. these actors know full well that taking on the role of a race-swapped character is just pandering to the woke cult.
is there not a ginger actress in the whole planet to play red sonja
I think hannah is gorgeous but not for red sonja  not the height  not the nordic look.
drunk 3p0 or jay is always good and has lots of cool stuff to say like his channel of course its good that he s now I believe he s married to gina carano...someone correct me if thats wrong.  or you know what dont correct me
will she be red headed
nice. its a combat flag. appropriate. nice shirt.
I just realized I was following you on tiktok for a while now and did not even realize it
I see you got a cat. so youre a cat person
brigitte nielsen wasn t up for reprising her role
@better than fox  she always looked so short next to matt smith.  anyway  brigette was like 6 4  if I remember correctly.  she stood eye level with arnold schwarzenegger.  one of my favorite memories of the original was the battle they had with each other.. at least until ernie reyes  jr. got in the way.
well actually this actress is half norwegian. meaning shes white as well. red sonya is from persia which this actress looks the part and also no one complained in the 80s when brigitte nielsen was blonde playing the character

terry crews could pull it off.
redhead this time  damn I hope so. also isn t that gal in the thumbnail  in that terrible resident evil movie
youre kidding  mel
gina caranno red wig  nuff said lol
its never good news. its just a speed bump on their way to shitting on everything.
thatshirt though
facts
d lo you have to watch claymore
you also have to consider red sonja is inspired by bodica.  but lazy race gender swapping is in fashion.  I have very little hope.
someone  somewhere is absolutely hell-bent on ruining everything enjoyable about the 80 s.
only a ginger can call another ginger ginger
thats not a woman baby thats a man baby yeah!
at this point they might as well make red sonya a bald 5ft asian guy with a beard and rename her yellow sao.
that one slevees style so cooll
thanks.
I highly doubt this movie is ever going to be made  they just use it to get headlines from the casting.
unless red sonja is a red head I will not watch this
I ultra love redheads I ll be damned if we re gonna let these uneducated   inexperienced sewer mutants destroy  bastardize   destroy our beloved characters.for what  just to please   simp for one person
chain mail bikini!
first!!!
they made brigitte nielsen red when she was blonde
hit that like button boom! people trying tell me what to do bye felicia boom! am I a boomer boom! idk boom. yuppers boom!!
showin of them tattoos
killjoys
red heads get a crap end of the stick
why is no one standing up for the gingers  they are ok to replace  note  I am not a ginger but they are people too!
redhead replacement seems real in hollywood. I dont get it.
got to get the hair right
mj basett  the director of the strike back series  who went completely nuts on drugs and is now a woman
stop the gingercide!!
so for all of the people claiming they aren t racist  how many true friends do you have that aren t the same race as you  dont give me excuses.
verse of the day       omg subscribe
ranking of kings and the 86
modern hollywood isn t capable of making a fun movie with a fit red headed woman in a gold chainmail bikini.karen gillan after a few months of muscle building would be incredible. which is why she wont get the part. what s going to happen is they ll put a short black woman in a phony red wig and give her  practical  armor.
if she doesnt have red hair Im not watching it
Im not religious  but with all the crap in the world... even Im praying for judgement day.
gingercide
that chick would be okay for red sonja. its about how they look  not their ancestry. notice no one complained about jessica alba as susan storrm  she looked the part.
it certainly seems deliberate at this point with the replacing of gingers of poc. its lazy  tokenizing and pandering. and it does make you wonder if the casting departments have dyslexia when they see the word ginger. like  no one is thinking about that undertone when they keep race swapping the redheads.
several talented and gorgeous gingers in hollywood  cast them instead of keeping with the gingercide.
oh really  I didn t notice
bridget nielsen was blonde when she was cast
@better than fox  jessica alba is mexican. ethnicity  not birthplace.
@better than fox  not sure what your point is  if you even have one. jessica alba is not born in mexico and white. she is born in america and mexican.what I said was that no one complained about her in the role because she looked like sue storm. this proves that when someone complains about casting choices it is not because of racism but because the actor actress doesnt look like the character they are portraying.also  italy is in europe and south africa was colonised by europeans so of course they are white.
hell no one complained that brigitte  nielsen was blonde
I highly doubt we are going to see her in that classic chainmail bikinI in this current era of political correctness. just take a look at bridgette nielsen s red sonja in the 80s  even back in the day hollywood was worried to show her in that bikini.
see  its this identity politics pandemic
Christ is king
liveaction starfire was poorly cast
canthey just get a white redhead for once
if they cast someone less buff and less beautiful than bridgette was  it will be a failure.  everyone will make the comparison and its dead in the water no matter what.thatsaid  my faith is low in the project anyway just because  its hollywood .
who
I like that actress but she wasn t right for sonja. here s hoping they now hire an actual ginger red head and not a poc now! lol
I cant believe red sonja is having a white girl cast for the part. lol. thought for sure it would be an african queen with a red weave.
titans starfire is so not starfire.  we shall duel online.  in a turn-based game.  Im old whadda want also aliens and terminator both pre-date wokies and their  invention  of strong female characters.
I cant help but notice you still haven t made changes to your channel to suit all our personal tastes.anyone would think you own this channel or something. very cheeky
the character has red hair and green eyes.  cool  lets cast a black girl
watch it flop
guessing we will never see gingers play any roles anymore...yay.....
oh look  another movie I wont watch.
hiiiiiiiiiii
another character ruined
no. starfire on titans sssssuuuuccked. personality and look. if zoe saldana can wear green paint all over for gotg the person who played starfire should ve been orange. keep gingers ginger. stop the swap.
...so a role for a red head who... wont get a red head to play it. yeesh what s with hollyweird and the hatred of red heads
well if they race swap sonja it wont be watched in my household...just tired of the sjw bull crap
if I was the director I d give her a sleeveless chainmail shirt and her classic chainmail skirt.in the third act of the movie  a monster would strike at her  ruining the chainmail shirt.she grabs it and throws it away. from that moment on  she has her iconic comic book look.this way  you can do all the promo images and trailers with the chainmail shirt while also givingcomic book fans the iconic red sonja look at the end.
no one complained when brigitte nielsen was blonde in 85
none auditioned
@t.o t.o  none auditioned or none were allowed
the majority of ppp dont her or that movie
that will not happen. we are living in a black and dark world now.
@der magnus   then they will get nothing form the fans.
this woman is half norwegian
well actually this actress is half norwegian. red sonya is from iran which this actress looks the part and also no one complained in the 80s when brigitte nielsen was blonde playing the character
no one complained in the 80s when brigitte nielsen was blonde playing the character
she isn t race swapped she I half norwegian.
wont watch it. needed to be somebody believable as a red head.
another redhead bites the dust.
if anything itsolidifies that there is a God if chimps have a 2  difference in genetics. well I guess I am not a monkey s uncle.
sweetie there is no  test  developed by the white man that cantell you if you are native or not. albeit we do have different bones and capillaries.
think I ll pass  another character being destroyed for the poc woke era no thank you !
wow some more swapping of character race  Im just done with all this  I wont be watching any woke movies anymore.
it will still be crap.
starfire should not be a ghetto ninja  and no no black girl should play a white women
sorry but I wont watch a non-white red sonja
red sonja ! ... red !!! ... as in ginger  with white skin !!! ... now this character is replaced with a fake !!! ... a black girl     ... damn this  woke  sh!t !!!! .... all black actresses replacing white ones is hilarious  and an offence to some of the writers who invented a hero ! ... what s next   ... connan the barbarian replaced with another black dude   ... how about darth vader  in star wars     ... why not offering the role to a black guy  for a change   ... what   just because he wears a black outfit  with a black cape  the guy underneth cant be black   ... how about a  new  batman movie  with a black charracter   ... how about putting a black woman in the batman role   ... so we can exchange even the gender of one hero  not only his skin color !!! ...  and whoever heard about black adam     ... another white dude !!! ... take that black culture !!! ...
sao is trash tbh
every woman would be better than karen gillian. she have common face without any exotic facial features.
a black woman playing a redhead   that is so cring. I look forward to a redhead playing black panther next.
brigitte nielsen was blonde
she is norwegian
well actually this actress is half norwegian. red sonya is from persia which this actress looks the part and also no one complained in the 80s when brigitte nielsen was blonde playing the character
