blackface is a very specific practice  only really offensive in an american context.  foreigners using costume makeup to darken their skin is so far from  blackface.   honestly  if youre putting in effort to make it look good and not going full trudeau  youre fine.salute to a fellow irish native american.
the best thing you can do is ignore these people. enjoy the kitagojo ship and watch itsail. the show is worth watching. you get a good romance and a wholesome story. that and the cosplay info is pretty spot on. my theory is that they cant stand seeing the female form. all the stuff they do makes them look like men. they want everyone to look like some androgynous blob.
leave it to people who probably dont know what the sun is to get upset over a tan lol
this happened to a  russian   cosplayer who used a bronzer to tan herself in a cosplay a few years ago.  twitter went after her hard.  so messed up.
imagine trying to act like tanning is cultural appropriation.
this anime is so good. I dont understand how people can get upset with something like this. like pretty soon no one can go outside or to the beach because you might get a tan and thats not allowed. people are really reaching with things to get upset about.
actually  in japanese culture  there is an understanding as to what  being offended  actually is. I only know this because not only have I studied japanese culture  but my aunt  who married into my family  is from japan. she married my uncle  who served 22 years in the us marine corps  which incidentally led to him being stationed in sasebo  japan  I think .my grandparents also took a trip to japan. and it is interesting to note that artists  for example  actually take offense if you offer to buy their artwork  rather than ask for it as a gift  as my grandfather found out after an artist drew a still-life of him. the point is  I think  that  being offended  in the us has turned into a meaningless term  like racism. does it exist  yes  Im not denying it doesnt. but itsure is funny how the word or phrase carries a lot less weight here than it does in cultures like japan. and thing is for me  Ive never had near the difficulty communicating with foriegners from places like japan or elsewhere. I tend to find that they dont second-guess everything you say  and try to read between the lines and find something there that may or may not exist  in terms of meaning. I guess its why I like foriegners  because I find most foriegners to be more plain-spoken than most american people  save for people who live in the country  or in a small town.
this anime is so good because the female lead is considerate towards the male lead. she doesnt disrespect him  as a person or even make fun of his hobby. she does tease him sometimes  but its obvious its not malicious. also  the female lead is kind to everyone.also  the animation quality is really good! like  it has no reason to be that good  but they did it anyway.
Im not really a big anime fan but I can respect the art style. I will however help gatekeep your fandom from wokies.
imagine thinking youre not a -ist but literally imply that a section of people cant get tans because of  colorism . twitter really does live on a different level ig.
next time melonie gets asked what tanner she uses  she should just tell them  the sun s empowering rays!
I have to constantly remind my self that twitter is not the rest of the world.  it is a small amount of sad people with nothing going on in their lives.  that being said   thanks mel for trying to leave the world a bit better than you are finding it.  we need more people to do that.
girl  the wokies are so mad at you because you are a. very pretty  b. very charismatic  c. confident and d. dont care what they think about you.  you are an embodiment of everything they hate.  and everything we sane people love.as a person who combusts in the sun like a wokie in a southern baptist church  I am jealous of all people who cantan.  doesnt help I am on three different medications that make skin more sensitive to sunlight.  oh yeah  I live in sunny california because I apparently enjoy pain.
the fake rage aside  I highly recommend my dress up darling. I watched all the episodes they had put out last weekend and I really like it. its very cute and the animation is wonderful. they paid attention to detail with a lot of small things and I was very impressed with that.
twitter activists need to learn about the gyaru and ganguro subcultures in japan. getting a tan doesnt make you racist.
Im so glad that for the most part japanese  korean  and other entertainment markets dont listen to these people. there are so many things they put out that I disagree with and dont like and guess what  im glad. because some one out there does agree and does love it  and even if something is genuinely wrong it can provide a great road to a good convo. well at least among the adults.
Im part okinawan  therefore also considered japanese . I can confirm  yes  we can get dark  that being said  there is also a fassion style in japan called  ganguro  that became popular when I was a kid.
in joker voice  hollywood turns a bunch of redheaded comic book characters black and nobody bats an eye because its all part of the plan  but one little anime gives a character a tan well everybody loses their minds!  love the new channel melonie. stay positive. stay happy. also watch old school demolition man for a good laugh!
translation   its not fair if light-skinned people get darker because dark-skinned people cant get lighter. how dare you be ok with someone doing something not everyone can do!  if you want to know how stupid that logic is  let s take that exact same train of thought to the extreme   how dare women give birth when men cant do that!  seriously  what is with these people. its like being offended has become a form of entertainment in and of itself.
the anime is awesome and anything new that comes out will find a way to trigger the wokies cuz they literally are offended by everything. we went through this with goblin slayer and rising of the shield hero.
and really you know when its done as mockery. anything else like cosplay shouldn t matter to anyone. nor should those people who do so be shamed. just because people with darker complexion like me  Im brown  cant just turn white doesnt mean people with lighter complexion should be policed from getting a tan. I d go as far to say as long as you aren t doing it as a form of mockery even if it doesnt look good on you feel free. Imean Ive seen some cosplay pics on the internet and some really aren t good with their make-up or costume designs. probably since they are new to it or cant afford it but in no way does it mean they cant do it.
thats the thing that always get me. americans are always freaking out about blackface because for americans the historical context is pretty offensive  but bruh. I lost count of how many times entertainment shows and actors from for example brazil have made  blackface  as a mean of representing a dead black artist or person of historical importance. I always get baffled by how offended americans get because the concept of it being offensive is so alien to everyone else in the world.
never go full trudeau.
this is like the shitty advice lazy parents give their kids when they are getting bullied.
@pass_the_m  my father would always tell me  make an example of them  make them and those that witness that youre not to be treaded upon. he d tell me   dont fear other adults  I ll back you if you know you were in the right  but fear me if you started the problem because I will not tolerate a son is a bully.  I remember his words so well and I put them to the test on a number of occasions and he always had my back until his dying day.now days  his advice would go over like a lead balloon with these schools that think they own your kid.
@mr. rose  what we really need to do is figure a way to make an example of them without becoming like them becoming the monster  is what has led us here to begin with and we really need to find a better approach or the cycle will just stay perpetual
I dont ignore them  I taunt them. I have fun with it
baaaahahaha
they dont think there are differences between men and women..... what do you expect from these people
@dinoslay  what rock do they live under
these are the same people that end their rants with  go outside and touch grass! . I say  put down your participation trophy and mow the damn lawn.
who was the person because I would love to support them
dang really
was that jannett incosplay
was that the pokemon character  I think I remember this.
that one was kinda different since the character was black. but what people dont realize is that the cosplayer was russian and has no clue about the history of blackface etc.
@bigman dogs  so you can do brown face
@nielen emhof  yes why not
@bigman dogs  why was it different
it was the zombie shark girl who got dissquilfiled for her cross play and idiots said its black face
@nielen emhof yes.
@mrgrimjaw  I think you mean the pyke cosplay from league of legends. we re not even sure if he s black because he s undead. for all we know he could have been the whitest dude ever when he was alive.there were also others who cosplayed lifeline from apex legends and were cancelled for trying to be true to the character down to the skin color.
@avery  I know I still call bull on both that crossplayer won fairly to be dissatisfied she should have sued the con and the contest
@mrgrimjaw  yeah  its so stupid how people cant appreciate art like that.
I remember when people got offended for people making food from other cultures  stuff like that is so stupid.
@nikolas devalois  I personally know a lot of indigenous latin american people who get irritated when people call them  latino    latinx  or  spanish . they also get annoyed when people assume spanish is literally the only language spoken in their countries when  for instance  mexico officially recognizes around 68 different indigenous languages region-by-region basis.
@p. whitestrake  that will leed to some communication problems...
we all really should just stop paying attention to these people.
I would have to agree. Im really not an anime fan either. there are a few that I absolutely love  like death note  toradora  yurI on ice  made in abyss  and monster. but most anime just dont appeal to my sensibilities  mainly bc a majority of them are heavily action-based .
@johnny r  have you given violet evergarden a shot  great story and very little action.
@danihel arun  I actually saw the first season  I just forget about it a lot lol. maybe I ll rewatch it  bc I do remember enjoying it  I just forget practically everything that happened.
@johnny r  there s also a special episode and 2 movies. im sure you enjoy those as well.
@johnny r  I loved death note. attack on titan is my favorite anime
good they best stay away  they are already destroying all movies they touch.
make gatekeeping great again
@eric demoniacx  aot is a great one too! I forget about it a lot of the time  but whenever its brought up  I instantly remember some of my favorite scenes. I do wish it leaned more into the horror elements of the series  like in the first season  but learning about the titans was pretty interesting too.
@hitroman  eh  kinda sorta. there are a lot of action anime  so while youre right about there being many non-action anime  I d say its still fairly obvious that the action genre heavily outweighs a majority of others  especially in terms of quantity. its been very hard to get into the medium  bc most of what I do find is action  and Im turned away  and the rest of what I find  Ive gotta sifle thru and pray I end up finding something worthwhile.
twitter just really needs to die like myspace did.
@erik mckoul   it really does.
Im really loving it myself.
Im reading the manga but my anime sause says its 2nd place most viewed right under one piece so I definitely believe it
@p. whitestrake  Imean thats the reality that most people dont realize thankfully  eastern media s main demographics are easternsure  somewhere down the line  the consumer bases over there may get  woke  too but I doubt it  cultures with histories as broad and old as those dont typically buckle under completely irrational thoughtIve been following various forms of asian media for a very long time  and Im excited to see a rise in asian creators artists just not giving a shit about western criticismthe world doesnt think we re the moral superiority anymore and it fucking rules. lol
Im sure they dont even realize they exist lmao
russia sure doesnt. russian movies are dope af. watch a russian movie as soon as you can.
lol   watch out though now they have a tan photo of melonie  they cantry and get her for culture appropriation of  ganguro
@stagfoo  ganguro is the fassion style name  they call the people who are using the style a gyaru. in this case she d be a  gyaru girl  but without a ton of makeup
I legit read that in mark hamil s joker and it fitso well.
and when their own comics dont sell  they get what they fuckin deserve.
I can get dark as wesley  snipes in the summer than light up to light skin in the summer
not long found your channel but loving the content. you seem like a really genuine person  may God bless you
oh jeeze. Imean my skin tone can range from light tan if I work jobs away from the sun  to rather swarthy from the sun to the point people will think Im different ethnicities. stop telling people they cant get tans! this is like the animal crossing space bun hair thing all over again!  doing great mel  I remember back when you always had to bite your tongue so Im glad you get to be free hoho.
did you get your hair done  it looks great!I never understand why they want to find offense in everything. as someone who works a normal job and lives a normal life Im already exhausted. I cant imagine how exhausting it would feel to be offended at everything.Im just gonna read my Bible then watch an anime without being upset over every little thing in it.
I work in retail. I had a customer say   I dont mean to insult your intelligence  but   I immediately replied   dont worry. its been insulated by the best.  Ive also said   there s no such thing as a stupid question. the only stupid thing is to not ask. otherwise  how would you find out the answer  I used to get angry a lot. as Ive grown older  Ive realized that its not worth the energy  and it wont change the other person  so I decided to change myself  mel. boomer going boom.
hImelonie. I was wondering if you d ever consider doing a video or a series on some female characters you find to be just as interesting and excellent as classic lara from character design  personality  and development  I think it d be cool to hear your thoughts on them. feel like we ve been gaslit to think  strong female characters  with are a new thing that the wokies are responsible for.
hey melonie  I just wanted to thank you for what you do.  I found you on youtube last week when I was at a very low point in my walk with the Lord  and honestly didn t know what to expect when I watched your video  but when you did the verse of the day and talked about your faith  it really encouraged me to get my life right with the Lord that night.  Im doing a lot better since then and just seeking God s guidance and grace to lead me through.  I really enjoy your content as well and have subscribed and been binging your videos lol.   God bless you  and keep standing strong!
I cant fathom how there are people on the internet who dont know what a tan is  they must ve seen kids in school who were tan af after summer break and then got pale af by winter  or seeing their classmates come back from a tropical vacation during winter break and being super tan now
I dunno if its jealousy or boredom or a mixture of both. some people just need to get over themselves.
just found your video and channel due to youtube recommendations  yes  really .there s timesplitters rewind. yes its been in development hell for years  but the devs are not professionals and said that the main reason it been taking so long  is because they didn t realize the scale of the project. the multiplayer seems to be pretty much working in an alpha stage and have showcased with footage and all of the base modes are working. its really down to the animations  assets  environment art  character art and single player missions  I think. the engine itself is working perfectly. they re probably going to drop a version when they finish up on the timesplitters 1 single player missions. since they mention they re going drop  newer versions every now and then.plus there s also the two guys who were working on goldeneye 25  a faithful remake of ge  but are now working on  s.p.i.e.s dont die  because ge 25 got c d    . the soundtrack the music guy was making was sick  he s a fan of eric sierra and captured his style from the movie so well. look up  the janus files  on yt and you should find it.as for perfect dark  well  last I heard they re rebooting the series as a stealth game... why
anime women shave their armpits  have they gone after this one yet  lol
Ive seen this anime and the best part about it. is that the girl who s playing cosplay is the kind of girl every guy wants to marry she s kind  considerate  and wont make fun of you for your personal hobbies likes or interests.long story short she s the kind of person everybody would treasure as a friend sometimes. but this caption in this moment in this frame makes her look like the worst person ever. find that kind of funny.
nope  we must not allow this or any anime to be cancelled!
booooooommm!!! when people want me gone  makes me want to stay here even more  that is the same thing for me. I have been threatened  insulted and told multiple times for me to stop making videos for my channel or show my face. and it just means I want to stay here even more!
that comment from fabrickind is just sad. the part where she says that ppl with dark skin  cant just take it off.  thats messed up. there is nothing wrong with having a darker skin tone. for those who actually wish to  take it off  you need to re-evaluate yourself as a person  as a human being. stop with thatself-hatred. learn to love yourself for who you are  skin tone and all.
if nothing else you can always count on people to be offended. love these videos Im going back and watching some early ones and your commentary is authentic and entertaining. you blend the spiritual and natural beautifully.
wouldn t people having darker skin help normalize it  and thus help fight colorism  if you think about it  this is a great anime stride toward social justice.
mel  you rock  keep doing what you doing and disappointing the haters!
I am writing this to help out melonie mack and this video and this channel with the algorithm
I saw an interview with a famous anime creator  I cant remember his name . he said that he loved anime because  something along the lines  of while japanese are usually so serious and conservative  anime can be as silly and fun as he can imagine.
well  we live in a world where calling a bag a brown bag is racist and non Christians ending prayer with  amen and awomen . heaven forbid a cute girl rocks a tan  real or otherwise.
the thing is they cant cancel anime cause anime turns everything into gold
leave my dress up darling alone  Ive been reading it for over a year now and it is so adorable. later in the comic they even have people cosplaying other sexes so they should love it.
one thing we canthank the wokies for  they are giving us new anime to watch lol.
wow these people literally have no life. this is why Im praying for something drastic to happen in the states that will either wake these fools up or wipe them out. its these types of people that truly push people to do horrible things they would have never done before or worst. thought the cosplay was good and hope she does more. this woke mentality is going to hurt those that are woke worst in the end and honestly I no remorse for them at this point in life. too old to care anymore. melanie mac you are awesome and keep these videos going.  keep offending these morons and keep being you girl.
yesterday it was berserk  today its my dress-up darling. we really gotta start gatekeeping this community again to keep crazies like these out. either that or tell them to keep their shitty opinions to themselves.
I used to have a year-round tan when I was a boy.  in my mid-20s it went away and I have the skin color of bread.  still have my fair complexion though  so age is still not showing too hard on me as long as I wear a hat.
keep up your good work on this channel melonie.God bless you!!
for those you want to know the anime s name its called  sono bisque doll wa koI wo suru  or  my dress up darling  in english
my dress up darling is one of the best romance and slice of life anime Ive seen. the manga is fantastic as well. its right up there with quintuplets for my recent favs
the girl on the anime is probably  gyaru   somebody who likes western style. they like to colour their hair bright colours  tan and wear a lot of makeup. it was popular a few years ago  but not so much now. Imet one once  she was really nice  lovely in fact.
as an anime fan  this news just makes me like anime even more
you know  it actually makes perfect sense that people living on twitter  who never go outside  dont know about suntans. lmao.
when we were kids one of my brother s friends would tan so deeply he was darker than a hispanic. and he s blonde   blue-eyed.
the worst part is that those people some times push that an anime character is  black  in a couple od episodes later the characters  appears with the swinsuit tanned marks marks  were they are pale like the other characters.
what s worse than the bad take is saying   I know that this is okay to do in that culture  but that doesnt make it okay to do as time goes on  I relate to charlie chaplin more and more  whether I re-entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me. I would like to have told them that the sooner I was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better  that I was fed up of america s insults and moral pomposity
context   the character used foundation all over herself to match the skin tone for a cosplay. she didn t have enough time to get an actual tan  since the idea was spur-of-the-moment. honestly  the anime is quite wholesome. op was probably upset because the character painted on the skin tone... lol but obviously this is not the same as  black face . op dug themselves a nice hole.
even if the character kitagawa marin is not tanned but using some make up to darken her skin for cosplay   its still okay   nothing is wrong with cosplay and portrayed character accuratelyif I ever going to cosplay someone like ozymandias from fgo  egyptian pharaoh  or dhalsim from street fighter  he s asian too  I ll have to darken my skin or else its not a good cosplay .
and we love it .. keep up the great work  japan.. thats why I just watch a lot more anime than anything else ..
in this case though  its not actually a tan. its actually foundation  it was actually clarified later on. not that I think people should be bullied for putting on foundation. everything is equated to blackface as if the intention of the person doesnt matter. not everything is a minstrel show.
when identity and race is at the pinnacle of importance  the natural outcome is to see every coment  every emotion  every image  and every person s worth  through the lens of race. it crushes the individual soul.
I generally prefer sci-fantasy anime and ones based on rpgs with op characters. sword art online fits what I like and does have a romance in more than one season. this one is interesting isekaI shokudou which centers around a small restaurant that once a week connects to a fantasy world. this is an amusing one kuma kuma kuma bear about a girl from our world which ends up in a fantasy world wearing a bear suit of armor. Ive been watching anime since astro boy and speed racer from the 1960s.favorite Godzilla movie would the one I saw first which was with raymond burr in Godzilla  1956 .
itseems like people dont know what the ganguro fashion trend was. it was a style popularized in shibuya where teenage girls would style themselves in ways that contradicted what was seen as the traditional style of japanese beauty  long black hair  pale skin  proper personality.  gyaru   gals  would dress in the exact opposite  dark skin  blonde hair  and outgoing attitudes. it was seen as a way of rebelling from japanese sterotyping while empowering japanese girls as to not conform to tradition and express themselves.if twitter drones did at least a minute of research on the ganguro trend  they d be in support of it  rather than taking down what is ignorantly seen as an attack on race. their outrage is just a control tactic  plain and simple. saying ganguro has anything to do with race is itself racist  but these twitter drones are too ignorant to see that.
people with dark skin cant just take it off  michael jackson has just entered the chat
came for perspective on woke nonsense  subbed for the gospel  more power to you sister! God bless!!
as an honorary asian during the fall winter time im pretty light complected but during the summer  especially since im in the desert I can literally drop 15 shades darker like bruh there is a 56 color pantone swatch that asians can hit on the chart
Im half mexican and I also cantan in the summer. mmm tanning  what a new concept! haha
people with dark skin cant just take it off . yes they can. the exact same way that cosplayer anime character did  with foundation.
I just got out of church and thats already enough internet for the day. I cant imagine being this indoctrinated in victimhood. it has to be exhausting. I am tired anyone else tired also why are the people that cry racism trying to cancel an entire culture for their own form of entertainment  yep thats enough for today
Godzilla 1985 is amazing and since I was a kid I thought I was the only person alive that favored that movie. its so nice to hear someone finally like it too.
ppl just cant stop trying to pick a fight with my dress up darling. itseems every episode they try to pick it apart  and its not even a controversial show its a fairly tame often sweet rom com show about a costume designer and a cosplayer.
marin is an angel.  best girl of all time.   mumble mumble...burn this company to the ground.
they will be offended and mad no matter what  if it isn t you it will be something else.  they are broken people who are just full of anger and hatred and can no longer think like a normal person.  just ignore them.
for a while I have been praying that God would bring a woman like you into my life. I did not expect it to be via youtube. I forgot God has a sense of humor and I should have been more specific.well played God
I cant imagine going through life so miserable  angry and jealous that you have a meltdown over an attractive fictional character. I saw a video one time where a woman got an add pulled for a robot toy cause it had a feminine shape.
just remember melonie  when the haters try to cannel you  we boomers have got your back...  for me when it gets a bit much I pop on   fake woke  or  snowflakes   and crank up the volume
your in my top 5 favorites  great job.
as a black man who speaks japanese  worked in the japanese music industry for 5yrs  dated japanese girls  understands the culture a good amount  and has lots of gyaru ganguro friends  this is actually mental bro xdI did a video talking about how ganguro is not blackface. its also pretty funny bc I just saw this anime last night and had no issue with it at all. I guarantee you she will think gyaru and ganguro are blackface 100 . even if  she does not have any historical context to the styles what so ever.you want an instance of when japan actually said some crazy shit to black people it was when there was a show  cant remember the name but nobita did a video on it and I remember seeing the original and thinking to myself  well damn ppl are gonna get mad   and there was a black guy running and he was winning and the announcers  who were japanese  said something to the effect of  the gorilla is winning  or  look at the gorilla run. that is messed up. not a anime about cosplaying.omg shit like this really gets to me man. its such a fkn shame dood.
I bet you she typed that up without a second  thought  really said  yeah this will do .
great anime  definitely worth a look especially if youre into romance
apparently this is one of the only animes where the character doesnt wear anything a school girl outfit all the time
good for you! enjoy your day!
this is why I have no plans on getting a twitter account ever. its toxic and unbearable as heck on there. not to mention draining as well.
if that anime is this manga I was reading  that it reminds me off   the guy is a shy family dress cloths maker and the popular girl is into cosplay  specifically more eroge cosplay  and was looking for someone to make her costumes.  Imade a comment while back on the manga  thatshe d make the perfect  roleplaying gf  in bed  p.   egging the mc on he has to keep her.also  japan has this fashion amungst delinquents  called gyaru. where they use heavy dark make up.  but the sjws are just too dumb to go find out. they never research before and after they preach.  and to be honest . I dont give any fucks to this bl... facing.  so many tools get offended what  actors  did in the past  it just makes me laugh at them. I d encourage it just to piss them off.
Im the same. Im mostly white but a quarter mexican so Im usually pale but come summer when Im out in the sun I can get pretty dark tan and I dont really burn unless Im out in the direct sun 8  hours a for week without a shirt.
being able to take off a tan is kinda like being able to bleach the skin and thus it is possible  check and mate.
you just made me realize that I have been living thatscripture my whole life.
people with dark skin cant just take it off  well  jackson didnt have a problem doing it.
this is why we and japan need to gatekeep anime from the woke clowns
mate... I cant even look at the sun without getting a tan. its insane! btw can we please get a walkthrough beginner guide to a carnivore diet I have been craving meat for months consistently and constantly feel like shitso would really like some pointers from someone going carnivore
yooooooo I was not expecting to make a video quote!I can happily say I was referred here by jeremy hambly. you are a beautiful breath of fresh air to the chaos of current society. I try to catch every video and look forward to your comment reactions as well as the daily verse. its very unique to have that. sadly its also unusual. admittedly I do not have the strongest spiritual relationship but those daily verses really do help keep God on my mind and more than once now  you ve picked one that directly applies to my current day or situation. make of that what you will  but he reaching me through you. keep it up! much love from a michigan milk hauler!
I love a good story and the hero s journey.
the worst thing that happened in that episode is they didn t show her in that cosplay...
I just heard about this anime less than a week ago. Im not sure what the appeal is  but I really wish american cartoons today had as good of artstyle and animation.
mock them or ignore them. if you have control in a hobby group and they pop up in your group  ban them as soon as possible or make your group actively hostile to them.
my dress up darling is great and pretty uplifting.  people complaining about her having a tan is embarrassing.  its just jealousy and making an issue out of nothing
I love that with all of the craziness going on in the world the biggest  most major thing on the wokies minds are  blackface and the proportions of women s bodies.   this is the next generation of leaders everyone.
I love this anime -- I remember thinking while watching this latest episode that  oh boy ... crazies gonna have a field day with this one  haha
I love final fantasy characters for the same reason melonie
I love the show and that girl upset about a anime tan needs a life smh
I knew this going to happen. I so predicted it
so far  for me  korea is batting 100 whether its been action  horror  drama  or animating shows like castlevania and avatar. japan is still pretty high  but Ive seen enough weirdness that not everything from them has been a hit  just the majority
I have two cats. my advice is to let them do whatever they want      unless it is harmful to them  which they never do.they bring me all sorts of live gifts. all sorts. I thank them and throw it away  discreetly.
true but this isn t even blackface
trying to cancel anime is like trying to put down fire with gasoline
I think your theory about teaching humility is a pretty valid one...
Im so white when I go into the sun my skin always turns bright red. I hope I dont offend any woke tomatoes.
I live in maine  grew up on a farm  work construction and spent 15  years in the army...Ive always had a tan from spring until late winter...my young daughters get even more tan as my wife has mic mac in her line
oh now tans are offensive!  what s next eyebrows !! unfortunately I just burn in the sun  ps love your channel!
Im the same way about japanese entertainment. most of the stuff I watch now  outside of youtube are japanese with english subtitles lol. anyway  have you seen shin Godzilla  if you hadn t  its a more recent japanese-made Godzilla film that makes use of practical effects and truly brings back that evil side of Godzilla.
I believe the main female character is supposed to be of the gyaru  sp   subculture in japan which is supposed to emulate the western overly tanned bimbo aesthetic which is also why she has blonde hair.
my dress up darling is a good anime  people just want to get mad over random things
melonie gets an extra pokemon for not being an iphone user  3
I hope japan continues to hold the line and ignore these wackos.
Ive been seeing it for some time  we always talk about how wokies hate men  and masculinity  but it becomes clear that these people have a clear problem with women and femininity as well. its a wholesome anime with nothing but sweetness  even I as a guy have to admit that   and yet this triggers them. I think their head would implode if they read berserk. also  expecting the whole world to see things through a extreme left american lens is patronizing beyond belief.
I would love to share a fav quote I learned a while back. stick s and stone s may break my bones  but everything offends a woke feminist liberal democrat .and its very true in this day and age.
my natural skin tone is the same as the tan anime character in that tweet but I use self tanner still lol the wokies will crucify me.
man this show was so fun to watch. really interestong details to about cosplay I had no idea about.
so tanning now is what toxic behavior  wtf  so now Im being inconsiderate when tanning  because someone with darker skin color might get what  jealous because they cant get a lighter skin tone naturally  is that it what kind of unbelievable bs statement is that... in the anime she used  dark foundation  to appear tanned. now someone explain to me  how someone with darker skin color cant do that the other way around...  especially since we are talking about the cosplay scene in this case. so melonie watches romantic anime  who would have thought... good taste in case of horimiya.
I hear ya. japanese media tends to be way better than american stuff just by avoiding wokeness. kamen rider and ultraman have become recent favorites of mine for years.speaking of which  who do you think would win in a fight  Godzilla or ultraman
how would they handle the episode of friends where ross gets like 4 tans per side  Im guessing there would be crying involved.
far from uncommon to come across white aussie s with natural tans almost all year round with similar  or darker  skin tone than that anime  and Im sure the same is true for parts of america. amazing how far from reality these type of people can be.
amen! good on you for preaching the gospel!!!
the wokies dont understand tanning because their is no twitter outside. plus the sun makes it hard to see the screen. I join you as someone who can just go outside and tan very italian go from pasty to tan every summer.
after your cat walked in I just wanted to see more of him
they better not cancel nagataro because her skin is tanned because honestly she s a fun character  oh man things are just getting so freaking ridiculous  the things that are getting canceled are getting dumber and dumber  plus at this rate everything is going to be canceled in which nothing is canceled  the canceling will literally cancel itself out
that cosplay anime is freaking amazing! Im caught up with the manga  but cant stop watching the anime either
you want a good life  get yourself someone like melonie mac as a friend. its a start.
keep up the great content!
if you enjoy romance anime I recommend toradora. its definitely my favorite. and thanks again for the daily verse.
op  oh oh  what self tanning product did you use     mm  mmm... uhm... the sun
ah the wokimons...... I thought everybody had to be open and accepting but sheesh. Im always surprised none of them pops a blood vessel by being that offended.....this said  if it did actually happen  it would solve the issue of wokimons.....a bit like in those movies  scanners   old but a classic
was just about to watch this ep. but seriously japanese artists could care less what some small time western cosplayer thinks.
I read the manga and I have been waiting for this episode for months knew twitter idiots would freak out
the narcissism theory is pretty spot on.
Im shocked twitter doesnt come after anime more ... she just got caught being a bot on the toilet...
oh no here we go  I had a feeling people were gunna trip  btw the anime is amazing
gotta love this person getting offended over  colorism  while feeding into said problem.
new to your channel  and I am delighted by your willingness to share and talk aloud about your faith and show how the Lord teachings help you stay spiritually strong and not worn out by the hate you might receive because of it. I ll be praying for you and try to catch your videos as often as I can. but for sure always put the Lord first in any thing you choose to pursue  be it your own channel or your choice in entertainment  because I to have to remember to not live vainly with my life that is now the Lord s. I hope this will be an encouragement for you  and like I said I ll be praying. peace
nice tan! haha I been hiding from the sun almost 10 years and still darker  also native mixed  lol but still a quite nice tan for sure! just curious have you checked out the  gospel of thomas   gnostic Christianity is a lot less well known compared to mainstream version  but got is an apocryphal text full of sayings parables of Jesus    I found itso enjoyable that I regularly meditate upon the wisdom therein. maybe give it a look sometime.  _
they are crying over nothing.  hell she didn t tan. she straight up says there s a body paint she uses. its to match the character she s cosplaying.
anime is the best. they really know how to tell a story.
and Im blonde and tan naturally. and yes japanese people do tan. Christ I lived there for along time and I can honestly say they tan. okinawa has allot of tan japanese.
the japanese and koreans understand that people want to be entertained not lectured
love it its hilarious its always over the top.
because woke people make the content about themselves  and not about the content.
remember when they tried to cancel ghost of tsushima because  its offensive to japanese culture!!    meanwhile it was breaking records in japan and got creatures just ignored the wokies till finally they  woke  gave up and started demanding a female protagonist for the next ghost of tsushima. thats how you deal with these morons every time  ignore them long enough and they just move on to their next victim to harass.
twitter doesnt understand cute girls.
I have a friend who is italian and she turns an olive color when she tans. its natural for some white people to get a bit darker after being in the sun for while.
you are the absolute best!!!!!  keep up the awesome work.
be a chad  dont skip the ad!
I ha e been wanting to see this anime for a while.now I wanna watch it even more
yeah this is so stupid lol first of all Im pretty sure theres a whole subculture in japan where gyaru  I think thats how you spell  what kind of girl marin is  tan themselves to a ridiculous degree. it isn t blackface or anything  its just a trend.Im technically mexican but my family from my mother s side comes from spain and my dad s side are straight from aztec  mayan. my older and younger sisters have light complexion skins while I have really dark skin. in the summer I laugh at them for turning red and getting sunburned easily while they make fun of me for getting just darker  its a whole family joke thing lolbut for people who s whole identity revolves around superficial things  like let s say....... skin color and sexual orientation  this is a threat to them. they see themselves as  so unique  and if anyone challenges them on it  they get angry because everyone else doesnt care about thatstuff. idc what skin color you have as long as youre cool with me. even if youre not  I can still respect as a person  as an individual  not part of a collectivesecondly  and I cannot stress this enough  its a bloody anime!!! we have people with silver hair and red eyes  purple hair  green hair  orange hair and every other color you canthink of. she s fictional  she cannot hurt you but if she did  thatsays more about your fragility than anything else lolthirdly  marin is an attractive girl. feminist and other sjws hate being reminded that there is a beauty standard that they cant compete with. now Im kinda on the husky side but do I sit here and go  how dare you !  anytime I see a male protagonist with a ripped body  no I go  holy crap I want to have a body like that  let s go! Ive been working out for the past few months and I can see that Im slowly losing weight but I still have quite a ways to go but even still I will not shame another man who is in shape because they have the discipline that I lack and itshould be praised.lastly youre irish indian  I just found your channel and huh I never would ve guessed it lol thats rather a unique heritage and you shouldn t let anyone else put you down for it. live in a way to make your parents proud by being goodalso youre a Christian as well  me too! man its good to know there are Christian creators out there. a word of encouragement from hebrews chapter 10 verses 24-25 and let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds  not giving up meeting together  as some are in the habit of doing  but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day approaching.
korean film industry has been on fire lately  imo.
I imagine these people have never heard of gyaru fashion.
love that top melonie    damn  not even fictional characters are safe from the woke crocodiles  there is a special toilet for them
a fan made timesplitters remake is in the works melonie. its called  timesplitters rewind .
speaking of anime  to your eternity is an awesome anime that came out in 2021. its very unique and adventurous anime so if you like that  I would say give it a watch!
this one confused me because the picture looked like a drawing. but it was fun to see your kitty  coltrane.
wait until she finds out about ganguro!
Im getting hard nostalgia thinking about time splitters.
the fact that they got surprised is hilarious  this cosplay was shown in the manga and the anime op before the episode. bunch of short attention span window lickers.
wait  using bronzer is now problematic  what about tanning beds  how about going out in the sun  what about a trucker s tan  where its just your left arm
in that episode of my dress up darling  best thing coming out in anime right now   its not a tan. they make it clear she achieved that look with skin colored foundation applied to her whole body. but she learned wearing that much make up on her whole body in the summer made her sweat like crazy.even if it was make up and not a tan  liberals who virtue signal about this are crazy and show their racist by saying  people of color cant wash their color off  as if they think black people should ever want to and a light skinned asian is just tormenting real people of color if they wear a shade for a costume.
your left arm would be racist
@blossom  yeah  its like they see dark skin as an affliction or disability  an cosplay like this no different than pretending to be in a wheelchair or to need crutches for fun.being dark skinned is a disability to be pitied. its as normal and beautiful as any other skin tone is.
anything woke can be controlled by cancelation  right  anime comes across that way cause anime went that way before art left the equation so now it escaped the wokeness but look that way to the crowd stateside.
japanese manga creators should wear the outrage the left cultist throw at them like a badge. they should never bow and become more like american comics. manga is on top because it doesnt bow down to crazy people and they make the art and stories that they want. as long as they keep doing what they are doing then they will continue to stay on top and make bank in the process.
I wonthe genetic lottery in my family  mum and dad both burn in the sun and my sisters a ginger so  lol I however just get darker and darker with almost no chance of sunburn  lol
those attacks to destroy manga anime looks so  directed  - no matter if its dumb or dumber. just like attack on  recently discovered by wokies  berserker  no matter what about are stories  only thing important is this surface level of seeing brutality only...best way of fighting is to laugh at them  as much as we can! and I can recoment itsagundam  critical drinker  mauler and nerdrotic  yes  there are more creators  like heelvsbabyface  but you can find them out for yourself now   so... have fun!
you have to admit.....the wokies are consistent when it comes to being offend about  anything !!!!!
twitter just doesnt like fun  jokes  art  anime and it all unless it panders to them which is odd.many got ran off or harrassed for you name it twitter wasn t like this before all from tumblr mainly moved over 2009 - 2015 was peak twitter more peaceful twitter shocking to believe.
I dont really pay attention to a lot of these controversies - but I bet they hated nagatoro
the episode that woke creature is referencing has to do with suntanning. its literally just a sun tan... like  what
at the stage of my life I am at now  I dont let insults upset me  no matter how bad an insult could be. instead  I clap back with creative responses that absolutely annihilate them off the face of the earth and then laugh maniacally about it. also  I brought 2 large rare steaks to this video after a good day of hard work. mhmm......steak.....
I love this series
true comments  I like this new format. people get offended far to easily on the internet  they say thing without being there in the real world  because they just dont think about what they are saying and I bet they would not say it in person.
love your cat  looks a lot like my best friend of 12 years dexter
me  I love my dress-up darling!   cancel culture vultures  oh no you dont!
ousama ranking is a very good anime! with animation style for kids with adult themes and nobody in  its a true bad guy  just victims of choice and consequence except for the Gods and gyakuza
anime is one of the last bastions of creative freedom left  and its one of the primary entertainment mediums for my household because of that. sjws are going to find something to be offended about  and will continually spin things up until they get something--anything--they can claim as a victory. and when they can get someone to bend the knee on one thing  they ll want it all. never show weakness. never bend the knee.
Im irish and native as well lol I get what youre saying.
also  um  I believe thqnordic is cooking up something timesplitters. they just need to announce it already. hehe.
can you do a work out video  that would be so awesome and some one for sure would get mad...not us though...
mel got the guns showing!
someone speaks about timesplitters...tears comes to my eyes
are you secretly a vampire  you dont look a day over 25
I am not a fan of anime. but I am far from woke. but back in the day afro samuraI was my spin move.
omg  tan anime girls are the best !!!!!!!!!!!
damn  I didn t know you turn bronze. thats hilarious.
melonie keep up the good work. you are like the farmer  you never know when one of the seeds you cast will hit fertile ground but what you say might sprout into a plant that bears fruit. I dont know who this comment is for  but someone is going to read this and think  he s speaking to me.  I am. someone is thinking that they ve committed an  unforgivable  sin. there is only one unforgivable sin. not accepting Jesus into your heart. all other sins are forgiven. you are forgiven. you are loved. does that mean you have to be perfect  no.  steps away from the podium  and now we return you to your regularly scheduled youtube video.
coletrain is awesome and cool camo top .  I agree with your narcissism take on the western countries.  wait now a spray tan is problematic smh.  great summer pic that made you look like you had lighter hair while on camera you look asian to me fascinating.
gotta watch ousama ranking! pure greatness.
what s wrong with tan women I want to go to florida beaches and meet some tan women hahaha  and good video !
being a metis person in canada. me mudder is cree and my dad was white. I go real dark brown in the summer and turn lighter in the winter. my younger brother would call me brownie in the summer when we worked together.
I dont know anything about the anime but that is a whole subculture in japan. I forget what its called  but its like dark skin  light hair  and fancy clothes or something. anyway  point is thatshe s not just criticizing the anime  she s criticizing japanese culture. how un-woke of her.
thats a sweet tabby cat!
hahaha so now an anime cantrigger people huh  Im surprised they re not mad about a bag of m ms! lol
I bet these people would implode if they ever saw naomI wu lol
this is nagatoro all over again
wait am I wrong to think canceling someone  lets pretend this character is an actual person since the wokies do  for having a tan a form of body shaming hmmm  shame  shame on the wokies! lol
hey  Im here for the kitty too! groom away  fluffy boi!
who truly gets offended by a tan  Im mostly irish  scottish  and welsh so the direct sunlight is never kind to me!
no human can save anthers soul  man  if this is not the most important bit of info you ever hear.
my dress up darling is a great show. I dont understand why anyone is mad. lots of people use fake tan and it is not the same as doing black face. its so annoying when people try to make something like this an issue when most people who act like this cud care less about actual problems.
the japanese culture is an aspirationally excellent standard.
Im tired of this cancel crap!!! they say be inclusive.. but here anime is the most inclusive stuff on earth right now. they have something for everyone  has a great story to tell  and it honestly brings so many people of different backgrounds together..so lets get rid of it!!the  is truly sad
kitty is offended  he s rage quitting
japanese cultures is pretty cool they dont care people think.
this is so exhausting lol
I guess that twitter person must hate nagatoro also
this is the problem america has. they re always complaining about that everything s racist. we get paid to be offended about fake nonsense. dont get me wrong  I love my country but its changing so much for the worst. never back down.
you ve got to be kidding me. this is getting ridiculous. now they re going after anime canthey leave anything alone.
honestly  just start making things that bother them  or  challenge them to  complete  successfully market  and profit from  with the condition of getting it crowd funded instead of having capital investiture  make a media series based wholly upon their complaints aggrieved by them of other properties.tl dr spite them for the lulz  or  challenge them to put their money where their collective mouths are.
seen the episode  the anime fun to watch. in the episode  she takes a shower and ask the guy help to re-apply it... she totally luv him  butt  I guess he is too nice...by the way one of my boss always come back from cuba completely red  as in blood red...if I where to expose myself like that I would die from 3e degree burns.
they are just jealous cause kitagawa is the best girl.
there are tan japanese people though... there is a whole ass harajuku style based around being tan its called ganguro.
I guess I should cover up in summer then since I get tan oh woes me
imo if you want to change anime youre not a real fan. a fan would enjoy the medium for what it is not for what you want it to be  because it would no longer be anime.
m.m.g.b. you are stirring the pot! lol                                                                                                                                                                            you are very brave and just amazingly  normal ! the best part is you just laugh at most of the woke and show why!  omg! you just showed that foto of you with the blue shirt. can I say that you are just beautiful  well its the truth so I hope I dont put you in any harms way... I kind of like all Godzillas but the one where he looks like a lizard  brodderik . you are right Godzilla is japanese. my question can Godzilla get a tan  I say yes! I n some movies he definitely has a light tan compared to others..king kong just gets old and grey  in before anyone else! keep rocking my warrior!
new follower here. what sort of anime are you currently partaking  Ive been bouncing between city hunter  dragon ball  inuyasha  and fist of the north star.
another great vid!
idk how you came across my feed but I enjoy what youre slinging.
anyone recommend a good anime  I am a big full metal alchemist   sword art online fan .so anything similar in that genre would be nice.
I agree mae us pale white foke are light when its not summer time but we get darker during the summer time
getting ridiculous  the woke hivemind have been going after anime since goblin slayer and rising of the shield hero.
@nukea6  I still find it ridiculous either way.
@nukea6  it was way before then. around... early 2010s when it was more noticable.
there s a nice little anime called  boku no pico  thats brilliant for some people. try it!
remember xinyan from genshin impact where she was hosting a concert  and due to all the bright lighting twatter was mad thatshe wasn t black enough  so they  fixed  it  that has got to be the first time Ive ever seen a black person wear blackface.
and the  women are objectified and opressed in japan  quote is a statement they also believed. even thou the top manga series are made by women.
woke people have massive egos. if you offend them  you chip away at their ego  and they get mad. having your ideas challenged is a humbling experience. and its an experience they dont want.
colorism is a huge issue and people with dark skin cant just take it off ...what !  if I am understanding this correctly  this person thinks having dark skin is a problem and those with darker skin want or at least should want to have lighter skin tones. that is absolutely backwards and racist thinking. if someone has an issue with another person s skin tone  then they are the one in the wrong  not the person with whatever  negatively perceived  skin tone.
your old tan makes me mad.  I didn t realize what Im missing.  seeing beauty makes me feel good.  are wokies trying to feel bad   Imust be messed up.  go boom.
being tan used to mean you were a peasant who worked outside and it was looked down upon. personally...I think people who  over tan  look wierd.
keep up the great wholesome comment and for your  outspoken faith to God and Jesus. amen  none of us are perfect.
as soon as I read the manga when it came out and saw this part at the very end of book four  I knewweewwww this would cause issues to dumb ass people on twitter
how dare they cancel my waifu kitagawa marin! she is wonderful! the japanese are able to create fine art compared to the wokes in the west  who just destroy. and if they were smart  they would know that the character was doing cosplay. cosplay which is one form of appreciating anime. the best thing the japanese have done to prevent these people from interfering with their entertainment...was just ignoring them.
lel  I was expecting this since I read the manga....... I was like  ooh lel....wait..... oh no....... hoooo noooooo.........ho nooooo marin........ they are gonna come for you.....
day 13 of commenting on your videos till g-fuel sponsors me. anime often had better messages in my experience. Imean I grew up loving spiderman and captain america  etc.  still love them but marvel is a shell of what it was now.  but just look at the messages and the differences in how super heroes  get their super powers. spiderman got bit by a spider. captain america was a science experiment. most of them are born with powers.goku  guts  even ryu from street fighter. they re yoked and they earned that through hard work. its very different. Im not saying one s better than the other  but one certainly lends itself towards a better and more inspiring message.
no way I just so happen to watch this show but I was already subbed to you  as a  white  person who s skin is about as dark as portrayed in the shot of the skin tone she s complaining about the character matching I find that person crying about the characters tan laughable
I hope every crazy person on twitter looses their phones
I find it funny....if wokies are getting triggered by current anime manga cosplay etc....ho-lyyyyyyy crap would they have a nuclear meltdown if they see the old-school stuff from the 80s and 90s.ninja scroll anyone  xd the rock man says  hello
didn t we just have a gyaru hate train a few months ago...they have a small one track mind that keeps going in circles
berserker is getting backlash from wokies now. I really like anime  first exposure was robotech then it was hit or miss for a few decades. now Im catching up on stuff. Im tired of the bs. video games and anime are meant to be fun escapes from reality.
lefties get triggered because they cant control people from other countries as well as they can in the us. those countries have their own culture  their own values  and probably dont care as much what a small group of westerners- who aren t part of their audience and aren t buying their product- think of their work.the anime  sono bisque doll is actually pretty good  though I prefer story character-driven romances and am horribly biased . the main characters have a great dynamic and its adorable to watch their relationship develop. it has some fanservice  which Im not as much a fan of  but a lot of it gets tied to the main characters and their relationship  its fun to watch them get suddenly awkward . also  Ive been watching more of your videos lately- I enjoy any content that isn t the woke lefty version  and I appreciate the Bible versus at the end. I need to do better about that kind of thing- I used to be  but got out of the habit  so this helps.
what  canceling marin kitagawa  no one has that kind of power.
if only netflix would stop making live action remakes of popular anime. death note  bad. cowboy bebop  worse. now they re coming for one piece...
they will never cancel my goldfish!!!
more reasons for me to watch it  is it called berserk  thats all I can find on crunchyroll and netflix
I love anime and hate to disagree with you  but humility is not big in the east  especially in japan. it is actually the opposite  they are all about pride. this comes across a lot in anime  characters always being driven by their pride. the reason japan is so unwoke is that they consider all non-japanese people to be inferior. this was a major driving force behind their relatively late-isolation  before commodore matthew perry of the usa sgowed up with warships and forced japan to open itself to international trade  they literally considered all non-japanese to be barbarians. this master race mentality also ties into the japanese involvement in ww2. back then  they actually considered us all sub-human  which is why they commitso many war crimes. but after the good ol  us of a  nuked them back into their proper place on the pecking order  they got more low key about it.like I said  I love anime and really like the fact that they are not woke. I just thought  as a Christian  you d like to know it is due to a cultural failing  that being the sin of pride  rather than due to the virtue of humility.
they are some of the most hypocritical imperialists. God bless anime.
that verse also describes the woke. lol
its not a good question for an atheist  because they do not believe in hell. its pretty simple  if you compromise yourself to save one person that is counter productive. the point is to try to help however you can and not pretend to help just to make yourself feel better. an atheist does good because they like helping people  without the benefit of an afterlife  because that concept is not a thought to them. as a physicist I can not deny or confirm any true answer  I just measure the things we can see and people can come to their own conclusions about my data.
lmao! I knew this was gonna happen. I knew sjws will whine about gyaru style or tanned japanese girls.
when can we get the japanese to apologize for geishas  you might say that is a part of their culture  but so is really dark tans  and one anime studio apologized for doing just that to one of its characters. also what of white cultural appropriation  why should all these other races be allowed to steal from the white man when their ancestors weren t the ones who came up with what made the modern day world what it is
Ive always gravitated towards japanese culture  anime  games  cars  etc. the 80s 90s era was the best  modern stuff not so good. the animes were better than western cartoons  japanese devs are better than western devs  the cars were way better than domestics. Im just salty that the prices for all my coveted 90s jdm cars have tripled in the last couple years and are almost unobtainable for an average person. oh and what s the big deal about a tan  in my experience  a lot of anime manga character designs are westernized rather than looking like a traditional japanese person.
I just got in to my dress-up darling  if they try any funny stuff I ll one-punch them through space and time
didn t they say people shouldn t judge black people cosplaying light skin characters  which I dont have a problem with black people cosplaying light skin characters  including fat people  even if its may be cringy because they re showing their love of the character they cosplaying.also correct me if I wrong  but japan does have a problem with colorism because of the pale japanese nobility vs tanned japanese peasants.
they forgot how the human body works in the sun
I think youre very wrong about humans not being good. I think we re unique among God s creations because he chose to save us because we have the capacity for good and we can be good. we can also save another human  not the way Christ leads to salvation but we can save each other by steering them away from damning paths  by picking up someone who has fallen  cleaning them up  and showing them another way  by helping each other and just being the difference between a bad day and a not so bad day can make all the difference from someone making the wrong choices that let them stray from God.
summer melonie vs winter melonie.tough choice
6 20 squatting in adidas gear... are you part slavic  too  xd
yeah  I prefer japanese and korean entertainment over western entertainment as well.
so  your saying its not a justin t.  moment
we cant just take off our skin color  hol  up. lemme put on white face and a blonde toupee. its gonna yuuuuuuge!
I guess people are not allowed to go outside and walk in the sun now
there are no good people  oof....
theyve never been outside before so im not surprised they are offended
oh no  animated scribbles changing colors  how could they
its literally in the Bible that no human is good  not one. so I dunno what to say to you on that one are we loved  yes. but are we good and do we deserve God s love  nope lol
@melonie mac go boom  verse  I ll have to reread. so why then are we worth saving  why has he saved us time and time again  to the extreme of sacrificing his son and flesh to save us
google japanese gal girl or gyaru girl.  someday these people may learn there s more then two types of human beings in this world.
they do realize some people kjll for their anime  right  no   good.
can anyone tell me if the anime is worth watching  I love romance movies but haven t found any good strictly romance animes. except gamers   the quintessential quintuplets
better not show them mr olympia or the arnold classic lol
I guess she never heard of a gyaru before
if you get triggered by anime then there is something wrong with you...
what do you count as a  walking sim   just looking for clarification
irony to those who said they gonna end race problem but talk about skin color subject 24 7
dear wokies  go outside and play with your friends.
I think these people are partially missing that these characters are japanese  not american european.
the woke disturb my perception of reality
I am a boomer so I have no complaints.
I dont get it........ there are tan japanese people. haha. its a style of their as well to have tan skin like the gal s. you cant paint all the cultures around the world with the same brush. I thought they would understand thatsince that is the  tolerant  side. they complain about small things since life is so easy for them. maybe when life gets hard in a couple of years since everyone is lazy  they might change their tone on real issues. they have to fight for something even though its not an issue.
leave my anime alone you woke wookies or whatever  seriously though  leave my anime alone
if they dont like the show  then dont watch it!
Imoved to japan to for my entertainment as well..you like Godzilla movies !! that is so cool
doom guy can save people from hell. and only doom guy.
ive enough cherokee that I pass for mexican in the summer except Im 6 3 . really mess with folks more that I can speak some spanish.
half of asians are naturally tan. I guess this hater never heard of akI dearest.
pretty sure its a stereotype that all asians have pure white skin  too. a lot of asians  take yer pick on korean  japanese  vietnamese etc  have naturally darker or tanned skin...
arnold classic was darker than some people born that way.
I really want to see a large group off people hurting the feelings of those wokies
@raul rosas  I like to imagine they get their feelings hurt 24 7 being out in public or online public communities
colorism.  lol.
k-drama is where its at! fyi
great tan mel
did the name koltrane come from  koltrane the creator of the azeroth public radio podcast
long live nagatori
melanie mac go tan!
I am pretty sur that person has had plenty of comments that make there way to hero heI s channel or rev says desu channel
really good anime
let em try
people not understanding tanning really need to touch grass
even the whitest of white can get tanned. my  white coworker surfs and his skin looks like a louis vuitton handbag.
thanks
fk em I want the dubs anyway consolation of subs mean nothing to me. I love japanese media  and I love how the mock and ridicule them for crying about stuff like this
thats a babe
one other comment  if tanning is  cultural appropriation   then what does it mean for people from the philippines  those people are more tanned than some black people in the states -- and they re also asian.seems like we ve got a double-standard here...
southern japanese people are tanner
dark skin tone is not just exclusive to only black people. there are other races that have dark skin tone too.
virtue signaling is getting so far-fetched that its comparing a sun tan with blackface.
yet appropriate the opposite gender is okay in their eyes.
like another youtuber youngrippa59 says  monetize your haters
leave anime alone
these woke white people have never even looked up or studied japanese culture  gyaru is a fashion trend in japan. their is even gyaru bars in tokyo   also recommend my dress up darling if you are into romance anime just know that there is of course ecchImoments in it
just wait til the wokies discover gyaru culture in japan  d
people are so stupid Im half polish 1 2 puerto rican and depending on how much I stay in the house I  can get really dark or really light
commenting to feed the algorithm
looks suspiciously like sun tanned black face
colorism  lmao..
I see chonker  I liek.
boom
man if they keep trying to fuq with amine
did she fart at 11 55  lul.I guess thats one way to get better   expel the worst.
colorism... lol.
I dont wanna live on this planet anymore.
ganguro girls  ever hear of em
my wife is asian and darker than that
is this person new to anime japanese culture  bc gyarus are a thing. wait  are they trying to cancel gyarus  as a poc Im not ok with that
this is what happens when the demand for racism outweighs the supply.
as an american of irish and scottish descent   I say and do whatever I want. anyone who doesnt like it  can kiss my  foundation ...

the issue with these woke cancel culture is  that they are racists and fascists. what they say  what they do shows  that they care about races and their features. I thought we are over that  and ppl matter by their manners  behavior and character  not skin tone.
lmao most of they time ppl thatsay shit like that are the racist oneseven I with brown skin get dark under long exposure to sunlightguess I turn a shade of racist too xd
this is why there are no original ideas in the us.
its called melatonin most people other than red heads on rare cases them to  can get tanned and in cosplay if your white and the character you like is black its ok to do that its not colorism its respecting a character and same can be said if a black person wants to cosplay as a white person more power to them as well
ditto
wokie person  I hate  people who do black face !   sits in the sun whole summer trying to get a suntan...............
I am getting so sick of the wokies  sigh   the anime is a great fun show.
hey mel I just want to tell you that wokie people just dont know how to be outside and get any sun bc most of the people are inside of buildings working at their jobs and new mothers are being inside the houses with their new born babies and other mothers are babysitting the kids and other kids to keep the kids inside of houses instead of being outside in the sun and so that is why wokies dont know how to be outside to get any sun to be tan  ok mel. anyway also wokies people want to cancel the anime bc they dont really watch anime cartoon shows or anime movies bc the wokie people only watch sports and watch non anime movies and watch news and watch other stuff like that on television instead of watching anime shows or anime movies  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that and let you know that too  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you my thoughts and my opinion on this topic  ok mel. anyway I hope you had a great morning at church this morning and hope you had a great afternoon at the gym if you had time to go to the gym today but if you didn t have time to go to the gym today that you had a great day today at home with your pets  ok mel. anyway I do hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok mel.
the salty army is legion. reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
the whole woke mob was bashing on a game on twitter   we need more black women characters in this game!  - its a japanese made game  they are making a great game with a great story. just enjoy the game! why is color so damn important  not to mention people losing their shit over there not being trans representation aswell..
sun bathing  cancel that person
Im reading her tweet and Im like  why the f  is colorism a huge issue  how is that an issue if youre not a racist   Imean  come on people. unemployment is a huge issue  not colorism.

dont you know that a tan goes against the woke cult doctrine! haha
lol
some tans are orange
I would assume the woke would like seeing skin diversity but looks like logic cantake a back seat
brazil!
there will be a point that this woke will be a laughing stock.
side note with your elden ring playthrough you have to watch this   https   m.youtube.com watch v t3guvcjbpj0.   absolutely fucking hysterical non pc parody
im not even sure what we are fighting about any more  like who fucking cares
woke people just make me laugh. I grew up in hawaiI and there s a lot of tanned japanese people living there. you know what  there s also a lot tanned white people there too. Im sure it has nothing to do with living near the equator
lol  colorism  hilarious. I love how they just make shit up. so they can get offended on behalf of people who either dont care or dont consume this media.
japanese people who work in the fields and work outside... look like that.. zero japanese peopel have blond hair naturally.. talk abnout that lol
this whole race thing is very weird to me. we are all just humans  our genetics are at most 1  different  most people are less than that. it makes no sense.
your assuming woke people actually leave their safe space. they dont even know that people cantan.
facepalms so hard a sonic boom destroys my window look... people.... its anime  its japan  they dont give a fuck about youre fee fees or our western social political obsessions.keep being japan!.... japan.
looks about the same color as the last president.
they  the woke lunatics  will not be happy until every person character is a black lesbian trans furry bi-ghostal amoba. please leave anime alone the only entertainment left that hasnt been corrupted.
I dont blame people who wants good shows moving to anime sense the woke clowns turn marvel dc comics star wars 007 james bond into a dumpster fire
the tolerant left
that is such a stupid take     Im black and that did not affect me in any way!! its cosplay for pity sake   . and anyone who watches anime should know that gyaru girls are often depicted having darker skins tones either due to tanning or make-up..... sigh ....
always woke gringos speaking on behalf of others. I guess that person never goes to the beach bc tanning is cultural appropriation.
what I cannot understand. why do the wokiez get upset with what us nonwokiez do  but we are not allowed to get upset with what they do that offends us
so does this mean if my pastey english arse goes on holiday to somewhere where the sun actually shines and inevitably come back burnt to a crisp Im now a racist
the amount of people who cry about black face still. I did it for halloween and enjoyed the whining
people mad about game difficulty obviously never had to play any nes or genesis game ! these kids dont know hard games !!
I hate woke messages but honestly I would be happy with anime being canceled
just get a list of what s not racist. its clear thats the shorter list.
keeps these woke from japanese culture  already ruined games and movies
woke people are very racist against japanese because japan is a very conservative country.
by this logic its  colorism is the sun give you a tan. what is this logic  everyone get some sort of tan when in the sun long enough...
stopped watching pedowood films years ago. anime is way better
an excerpt from luke 16 19-31 that is relevant to the question about sacrificing yourself to save someone in hell. emphasis on verses 24 and 26 the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to be with abraham. g  the rich man also died and was buried. 23 in hades  where he was being tormented  he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side. h  24 he called out   father abraham  have mercy on me  and send lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue  for I am in agony in these flames.  25 but abraham said   child  remember that during your lifetime youreceived your good things  and lazarus in like manner evil things  but now he is comforted here  and you are in agony. 26 besides all this  between you and us a great chasm has been fixed  so that those who might want to pass from here to you cannot do so  and no one can cross from there to us.
gee... tan in a can...just like trump uses... yeah deck stain comes off eventually... Im a redhead and burn easy... and hate sunscreen...
I cant even. triggered by tanning  are. you. fucking. kidding. me  tanning is 100  natural. what the fuck we suppose to do cancel the fucking sun
you cant beat bts.
first
this is not ok ... mmkay.changing a caucasian character to be black is not ok  either.change my mind.  d
shows you how cringe  pathetic and ironically racist the woke virtue signalling is. lol.
my issue with all this political bullshit is that most people seem to watch these shit cartoons purely for fanservice and like 1  of them actually have good stories. have you seen any of bakI the grapler  holy shit it makes soaps look good
oh yeah cheato or dorito dust is non toxic and can be delicious if used as a skin toner...
hooray!!!
