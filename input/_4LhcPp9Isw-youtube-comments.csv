Im just so glad the Lord of the rings trilogy was made in the early 2000s. it was a time when you can make movies with pure passion and love for the original source material and not follow some stupid political checklist
its ironic how they say they are making this in the image of the real world  but tolkien s work already mirrors the actual world and its history
to quote j.r.r tolkien   evil cannot create anything new  they can only corrupt   ruin what good forces have invented or made. this is what amazon is doing
Im not surprised by any of what Im seeing with the rings of power at this point. wokeness is absolutely narcissism. I kinda feel like they re trying to re-write the past  whether its tolkien or anything else  to fit their narrative. most of us were raised to judge people on the content of their character  but now all they want to focus on is appearance  sexuality  etc. all I canthink of right now is  who controls the past controls the future. who controls the present controls the past.  Im glad you speak your mind  keep it up. they ve been controlling the present long enough.oh  and I hope your mom is getting better. Im praying for both of you  dont want you getting the coof again either .
clearly a story translated into 20 languages and 2nd in sales only to the Bible wasn t reaching people. thank God amazon is fixing it.
we re making the show accessible for a diverse group of people   this is only under the assumption that your viewers can only identify with  characters based on skin or gender that reflects their own. the only thing preventing accessibility to the show is a prime membership.
this is so sad for tolkien and us the real fans of the Lord of the rings. this is just going to be a horrible mess. sauron looks like eminem s illegitimate son. like I didn t need a transformer to look like me to enjoy the transformers. really good Bible verse melonie. I share that one as a reply to one of your tweets not to long ago. we need to rise together. love the video melonie. still praying for your mother.
its going to fail so hard and I cant wait for the tweets on it.beyond the aesthetic changes  you know the writing is going to be so cringe  woke  intellectually backwards and creatively bankrupt because writers who are into this they seek to preach  virtue signal  exaggerate  they love dumb childish humor and they will try to shove in everyone s faces their ideologies despite being a story that is not about grooming kids into gender theory or minority anarchism. its about the impact of war on all people  coming together and while diferences exist there is good on each. its ironically a story about people breaking free of oppression  not falling into ideological oppression for social justice or segregation based on who is the most ethnic and woke of them all.
they  show runners  want the name Lord of the rings to sell the product but dont want to follow the content of Lord of the rings.  so its the halo show problem all over again
the people who are only able to relate to a character if they share the same skin colors sexual preference are simply shallow. you should be able to relate be inspired by a character through their actions  their aspirations  their goals  their fights  their background  their moral values...
no one wants to watch something that does not reflect the source material  especially when it gets destroyed and filled with wokeness to this extent. this show is going to have the most wokeness that has ever been seen in entertainment. they are disrespecting tolkien and his work. they had the nerve to say this would be better than toklien s work. fantasy stuff should not reflect modern times  that is bs. we want to escape from modern times. also  they made sauron look like eminiem  lol.
my way of dealing when woke stuffs come out is to boycott them  I will do it again with ring of fire ! but your way of dealing with woke stuffs by informing peoples via a platform and give your opinions on that.... I respect that a lot !  thank you for exposing all that non sens mel.
prayers for your mum  melonie. hope she gets well soon.
I watched the Lord of the rings trilogy  and that was more than enough for me - I really dont need anymore with the rings of power.geez  one ring was enough trouble! look at gollum at his mtv award speech!
so true. they are the ones saying   I cant identify with a character that has a different skin colour to me.  to them people with a different skin tone than them are  different . they are making it a topic to speak about. they are putting importance and emphasis on skin colour. its absurd.
Im so glad you brought back the verses at the end of the video! screw the controversey  you send a powerful message with each and every one of your videos! Im still not Christian and I love your way of making those messages make sense to the real world. so many people are too wrapped up in their own nonsense to take the time to relate with reality.
happy friday everyone!!  Im going to start watching peter jackson extended editions tonight. the only things these trailers have done for me is wanting to go back and watch the good movies
when this fails they are just going to scream about how everyone is an istaphobe and how its the toxic fandom s fault. these people are completely incapable of instrospection. just like star wars.
Im waiting for the headline  the Lord of the rings  the rings of power is nothing like the books. and thats why its good!
yeah  this was crossed off my list waaaaay back.I refuse to support woke racism in any form  and as far as that goes  amazon knocked it out of the park from go. great content as usual.
the 2000s were the peak of movies  especially the early 2000s.
there was still  woke -type stuff in those movies--it was just far more subtle--which is why Christopher disavowed them. still  far better than this crap.
yup. we are lucky to watched the real slim shady lotr in the early noughties. I give eminem amazon s version a pass. no way amazon s version going to better.
and the mmo was made in early 2000s too
@larry richardson  like what
it wasnt made in the 2000s  almsot fully shot  shot   in 1999 and the project started in 1994 I think  1998 the actors got together.
@jc  witch king   you fool... no man can kill me eowyn   I am no man  ahhhhhh
I wonder if there will be a lot of gang violence in it  like in the real world.
nope  just musicals and cat videos.
@dying rose  yeah no woke or political nonsense
also it was made in a time where it can be kept in the data age or online. but trust me future generation will have to do some digging to find it. when you sort history instead of tell history you create history so it repeats itself. its especially true today because the information age is so fast history can be rewritten so quickly. let s hope this isn t where we re headed in the entertainment world. these societal shifts comes in waves and last 10 years. this is the 80s parts 2 repeating itself it will go away just like it did by the 90s.
@thomas romano  fair but thatscene is nice for her
@knox2don  yes there was  like turning arwen into some action hero who shows up to save frodo from the ring wraiths  when in the book that was done by the elf glorfindel.
we got 3 amazing films  thats all we get.
this is the new boxxy now
and Im glad that this series is not connected to those films. it makes it very easy to separate them in my mind. when I watch the original star wars trilogy I cant help but to think of disney s star wars sequels prequels and it makes those original movies a little less enjoyable to me.
I have the lotr trilogy on both bluray and 4k bluray. Im all set.I have the digital version as well on prime  the code came with the discs   but Im sure at some point those will be retconned to be made more  inclusive .
youre not true lotr fans. the Lord of the rings movies are full with flaws and represent modern hollywood. but jackson fans dont read books and dont care aboot the lore.
@reek  not every fandom has to think alike. imagine how boring that would be. entertainment is subjective in case you didn t know. also  what makes you more of a lotr fan than the rest of us  if you keep up with that narcissistic mindset  youre not going to make it very far in life. and as a jackson fan  I have read the books and I love them. bold of you to assume that Im not familiar with the lore. not every adaptation is going to be 100  faithful. thats just unrealistic thinking. yes  jackson took creative liberties and made some changes with the story  but jackson and his team still made successful movies that captured the spirit of tolkien and they received great reviews from both critics and audiences. if you dont like the movies for whatever reason  thats perfectly fine. we can disagree. but you saying Im not a true lotr fan because I have a different opinion than you carries no validation.
youre not telling us anything new or insightful
@dr. thomas rasberry  what are you babbling about
disney has done this with star wars and marvel. dc is now trending in this direction as well. tainting what western society has thrived on and loved.
@m singapore  in the youtube comments expecting novel insight
false quote commonly used by fake tolkien fans  jackson fans .use the correct version  th shadow that bred them can only mock  it cannot make  not real new things of its own.
this is why back then films were fine compare now its always have to me woke messages and political stuff involved
Im not trying to create a consensus around my opinions to get everyone on my side. I dont have an agenda to push. I just want to watch a fantasy show. let us do that. if the series is not for you  then aw well. too bad for you  but dont try to take the fun away from those that do like it just because youre angry or miserable.
wokeness is absolutely narcissism.  truth over 9000! you said it on the bullseye s bullseye. I feel like garbage movies in the old days would be more entertaining then todays woke movies.
who controls the past controls the future. who controls the present controls the past.  yes    and their problem is - how can you control the present with any means of escape from the present still available to general population huh   d
its translated over 32 languages.
don quixote
wider audience  means hardcore leftist minority. seriously  it one of the most beloved franchises ever. it pretty much created our modern idea of  fantasy realm  with elves  orcs and dwarves.
amazon will prob reboot the Bible as a tv show soon  p
which some people might cancel in retaliation. bet that never crossed their minds.
stop educating them. theyre supposed to educate you.
pretty much.
halo  starwars  marvel  dc and it keeps going...people using the name of something to just sell shit.
I would argue that  relating  to a character isn t necessary in order to appreciate the character or story.so creators should stop worrying about whether the audience can  relate  to characters or not  and worry more about crafting a good story.
@seven proxies  I totally agree. there is no need to be able to relate to a character to enjoy a show. for instance  who am I supposed to relate to in the simpsons or south park  my point was rather to question why the people advocating for more diversity are only able to relate to a character if they share the same skin color for instance. as a  poc  myself  I despise that acronym   I never understood that argument  and think thats actually racist.
dont watch it. dont worry about being left out of the conversation  because  the conversation  is what they want from you. they dont care if you hate it  they only want you talking about it to get others to hate-watch it  so they make money.
I think there are lotr pornos thatstick closer to the source material.

@mike williams  bwahahahah! good one!
you dont care aboot the source material. I bet you haven t even read lotr. your knowledge of lotr probably only reaches to the movies  which themselves regularly contradict the books.your whining aboot  woke  shows you trash the show for political reasons  its part of the culture wars.
@reek  bruh  I own and read the hobbit  the Lord of the rings books and the silmarillion  so my knowledge goes far beyond the Lord of the rings   hobbit movies. I do care about the source material. the Lord of the rings movies may have had some differences compared to the books but they were amazing movies. I like the hobbit movies too but I do wish they reflected the source material more  there were things I disliked in them. nice try though.
also  amazon s show isn t reflecting any of the source material and they did add a ton of wokeness in it  not to mention the writing and fighting choreography is horrible and the armor is bad looking and this is just scratching the surface. Im not even political  the show is just horrible for many reasons.
yes! you get it. do not watch it. its a big world full of other things that aren t trying to manipulate you into hate-watching
yes  you are not a lotr fan. the movies are not Lord of the rings. they re unfaithful  well-executed action movies based on the books.
oh  lmao. you are saying that immediately after I wrote it. well  cheers. couldnt agree more.   you even called it absurd... weird xd
even the old movies trailers were a thing of beauty comparing to those series trailers  d
exactly what I said elsewhere  and exactly like star wars and star trek too. their truth is an opinion  which aren t guaranteed true. so inherently  these people exist on a fallacy. they are oxymorons in the most literal sense you can get.
@rigel b  fair enough
its going to happen just get it time.
oh we ve been getting hints of it in the interviews. its just a matter of time.
highly enjoyed the video! first time Ive ever seen your channel. your stumbling with some of the words was really charming. I agree with a ton of what you ve said. history has been constantly rewritten  but its so much harder to do in the modern day and I have to wonder how much they had gotten away with before this.
nice video. I read last night the writers  producers were heard saying  this is an alternate universe of lotr  which clearly it is but they re never going to admit that lol  I would respect them more if they just admitted that instead of them trying to say  oh this is canon to the movies
this show will be unforgettable for all the wrong reasons
you know  I think the issue I personally have is these people dont care how important tolkien s work is to a lot of the fans. just my story  my grandfather and I read the books together while he was dying of cancer  I took my dads first edition copy of the silmarillion to show and tell in 2nd grade and a bunch kids stole it from me and ripped it apart and laughed at me for crying  when I was getting sober I identified with frodo in a way I d never been able to before. in short  these stories aren t just stories to me and people like me  they ve kept us going through the dark times. so for someone to just blatantly disrespect his work  to say  it isn t good enough  we ll fix it  is offensive on a deep level.
I grew up wanting to be like bladehis skin colour wasn t important  it was because he was tough  strong  he killed vampires  evil  and his attitude.
that image of the bleached haired person at the top of the article isn t of sauron  just as a heads up.there s no credit on imdb yet  but the actor who s supposed to be playing sauron is named anson boon. the actor with the dyed blond hair is bridie sisson. it could end up thatsisson is playing sauron  though that would be pretty strange. I guess that fits the bill though  since this show seems to be doing as much as possible to be strange.
the same company that made a decent reacher show produced this too...its mind boggeling.
if I wanted to read a  reflection of the world we live in   I would never pick up a tolkien fantasy novel.youread fantasy to read about fictional worlds that you do not live in. the genre name kind of gives it away   fantasy . as in  something completely imagined  or  fairytale .there s hundreds of thousands of authors who write novels that  reflect the world we live in  already. pick up one of their novels instead. how hard can it be
series looks great. cant wait to see it.
even if the show fails  nothing changes. the media s goal is to get the new generation used to the garbage to set the new standards  no matter the cost   .
these people are destroying true art. thanks for keeping up the good fight.
so why use the name  because they want money  . sums it up perfectly!
Im going to love watching this rings of power... Ive been needing something stupid to distract from the seriousness of real life!
thank you for clarifying the insanity involved in the efforts of half-assed overpaid storylines that are aimed at dividing the groups of our previously somewhat cohesive society  before major foreign investments aimed at these subversive acts. the more people that are courageous enough to talk about it  the better we can all defend against it. keep being awesome.
speaking of poluting history  there was magazine  I think it was vanity fair  that came out a couple months ago with a massive focus on star wars and retold all of kathleen kennedy s accomplishments at lucasfilm  labeling each of the star wars wins as her own  despite her absence  and all of star wars s losses as some other factors fault  despite her heavy micromanaging
you know what would be funny  if on the day the show airs  the movie theaters start showing jackson s trilogy and everyone sees that instead. that would probably be a huge fu to amazon lol
exactly. history is told by the victors. so they can say they re trying to erase tolkien s work until they re blue in the face and when we win in the end  they and their crappy show will be forgotten or remembered as a bad joke. these people understand they have no control over how their work is viewed and it pisses them off to no end.
great personality and have so much to say. its a shame your videos are so short
galadriel in 2d age was a mother already  but they never mentioned it. and probably her seek of a safe country was due to this - I would give galadriel this motivation for the seek of safe country - it was becouse of her daughter! but they invented additional charachter to be shown as role of mother  what is that   d
never felt compelled to respond to your videos before. but... you nailed it!!!  woke narcissist. keep it up.
and the terminal list.
yep  no regard for the fans.. when lotr is searched for  I bet amazon is paying to shovel rings of power to the top   and bury the original source material.
jus dont give prime the views they need. watch it elsewhere  matey
piracy is your friend
talk about coincidence. this morning s sermon was on narcissism  its pervasiveness in both modern culture and churches. modern narcissist think they can change the meaning of words  even scripture. such individuals place their needs desires over God s and often place themselves as equal to God. I felt like God was touching me on the shoulder saying  you get the message yet  humble yourself .  message received.
lotr has been translated across the frikkin planet already and been hugely popular across it. all manner of cultures and creeds have loved this story. gonna be funny watching it get ripped to shreds on youtube. let them burn money if they so choose
this reminds me of a quote from the star wars disney trilogy. Im probably summarizing here  but  it was basically like   forget the past. kill it if you have to.
I am tired with my label listing me as someone with  internalized  bigotry  racism  misogyny and a host of other nonsensical slurs heaped upon me at every turn. I can not relate  sympathize  rationalize any behavior other than my own as represented by race  sex or political affiliation. such a sad biased viewpoint we see now. forget that all of us are human and have feelings or opinions as individuals no  now we are a collective represented by only our faults as seen by others and not our individual strengths.
youre a very good daughter to take care of your mom like that. God bless you and your family. I will say a prayer for your mom. duane.
great channel!  you are so spot on and make me laugh.  being a 52 y o  I remember the great tomb raider games on the pso.  besides the turd of rings of power series  amazon destroyed one of my favorite book series  the wheel of time.  and that new lara figure does look like a dude.  glad that the wokies were not around when mcfarland did his twisted oz series.
whatever barbara! I do what I want. now stay out of my room while Imake these rings.  sauron probably
they dont represent at all tolkien world or his views  his principles  values and complexity. this show is an insult to tolkien and his legacy  the european mythology roots were replace with american politics woke propaganda  the Christianity with payne mormonism and tolkien with people with no talent for storytelling. these actors actually have no real message  cant even get the philosophical essence of a mythology. all it is about seeing themselves on screen. this is why when you go to the trailers you have millions of dislikes and they got tolkien style mockery from the fandom. no way in one month the marketing will twist it  the failure is in september and this will be due to their poor artistic vision and not let tolkien be tolkien.
just stumbled on your video because the thumbnail reminded me of disparu s  and pulling up Bible gateway got me to sub  haha. looking forward to checking out your previous videos now and I hope your mom is doing well.
amazon deserve to have a monumental financial disaster on their hands with this.  will they be able to dazzle and distract sufficient numbers of normies. they re certainly not bringing the fans with them
its good to hear a content creator saying out loud that people shouldnt buy products while they are against what has been going on since the mid 2000 s. especially in gaming you often hear content creators say they are against certain things  but than turn around saying  they cant help themselves cause they are fans .
these were the best actors for the job.  more like jrr token.
thank you for your commentary on tolkien s writings which were never meant to be  adapted  to today s woke  sjw  gender neutral  society. he was writing a mythology for england and not a social documentary for the 21st. century.  hope you mother recovers 100 .
I have an idea. how about we set up gofundme for renting out theater auditoriums on the day it comes out. we can host public showings of the trilogy world wide. I do believe its on the anniversary of tolkien s death. so maybe we can say a few words before playing fellowship.
love your analysis  well youre right rhey just want people to like everything they they make without questioning anything  if you do youre all the isms in the dictionary
I liked the scripture you picked. Im new to your channel and Im watching all your videos. enjoying your work. God bless you.
melonie s drunk! but is she drunk on butter  red meat  or both
fun on instagram today  not a joke...melonie mac story post   believe in the power of divine appointments and guidance. God knows how to put you in the right place at the right time. you will meet who youre supposed to meet  see what you need to see  you ll show up right on time to step into the blessing God has for you!! psalm 37 23 instagram   see why fact checkers say this is false. satan   oh... I guess it is today!  ps  reliable leaks say the eminem guy is not sauron. halbrand is. yes  that was a spoiler  and  yes  nobody cares.
Imust admitit  this was a good video.
fans   let the Lord of amazon come forth!  let justice be done upon him!!!the black gates of amazon open and out of it  an embassy.  at its head rides a tall cloaked figure  with a banner bearing on it the logo of amazon prime  amazon prime   my master jeff bezos the great bids thee welcome! there was a long bitter silence amazon prime    ...is there any of this route with authority to treat with me   or indeed woke enough to understand me   he mocked. fans    we do not come to congratulate you on the upcoming rings of power series  faithless...and accursed!  tell your master this!  your company s agenda of preachy virtue signaling and political correctness is to depart from this series  never to return!  amazon prime    I am a herald of the far left and may not be assailed!!!  what do you want   let me guess  perhaps all the insights of scholar tom shippey  or the art designs of john howe  or the same wardrobe and costumes of the jackson trilogy ! !  fans     your treachous trailers have already crushed many tolkien fans!  millions more are at stake!  but you could save them amazon!  you were deep in the social and creative circles of the tolkien estate!  delay the series until its made right!  amazon prime    ha!  bigoted fools!  I have a token I was bidden to show thee! pulls out the tattered plaid shirt of peter jackson  and a heaping ash pile of burned books   the books written by tolkien himself fans    no!  amazon prime    the kiwI and the professor were dear to thee I see!  know that tolkiens legacy will suffer greatly at the hands of his host! a word of encouragement to the fans the literary universe of middle earth is the life s work of a brilliant man who over 60 years ago decided to share it with the world.  it has brought serenity and bliss to countless millions.  middle earth belongs to no target audience.  it is in no way gender-phobic  implicitly racist or offensive to any creed or group.  it is already an unforgettable masterpiece with a well deserved place in the zeitgeist of mankind s most beloved pieces of literature.  amazon has abandoned reason for madness.  they dare to pervert the innocent and beautiful message of tolkien to suit their own agenda.  they may make their show however they like but they do so at their own peril.  we the fans will hold them to account for attempting to bastardize middle earth. so many are already deciding to boycott the upcoming show.  many are even rallying together to pay homage to tolkien in their own middle earth-inspired creative works.  do not lose heart!  no matter what happens we will not allow the true memory of middle earth to be silenced or forgotten.  amazon will get no glory from us.  the message of tolkien will endure for it belongs to all of those with good will and all of those who have eyes to see its true eternal beauty.  and years from now  when the fight is over  we will all pick up our personal editions of the hobbit  or Lord of the rings  or the silmarillion etc. get cozy in our arm chairs  and put this madness behind us. .
sanford and son still has me rollin.
wait  september  fucking darktide and sage are coming out in september. I dunno about anyone else  but I absolutely cannot give a nanoshit about rop even if I did like woke bs. I have games to play by people that actually put time and effort into their productions. I cant spare a cent for people that cant write let alone describe things trying to one-up a globally-lauded writer.
s okay. its already rotten  it cant spoil any more.
I thought no one could ef up the story and lore more than what dumb   dumber  david benioff and d.b. weiss  did with game of thrones  but these j. d. payne and patrick mckay have managed to do that! nice thumbs up
nothing will change until enough of us stop watching these new  equity  shows. it will get a lot worse until they finally start to make good shows again
Im glad most people are sensible about the rings of power  and seeing how much itspits in the face of tolkien lore. however I do see a decent amount of people being like  oooooh shiny   cause it has a big budget  and then blatantly defending this crap.
omg  thinking bout what that out-of-touch actress said made my blood pressure spike.....this is how they kill off all d stuff we hav grown to luv all our life  everything is woke now...everything and they seem very serious about forcing this crap down our throats and im so sick of it..geez
this was great  and will said with the verse of the day. just helping a sister out.  its pronounced moe-der-nity.  I hope this correction isn t upsetting.
excellent video. well said.
you d think these big companies would get tired of losing money.
its not batman if he s now a news reporter in a yellow trenchcoat with a pet bat. the bbc did the same thing to sir terry pratchett with  the watch ....however  the changes go deeper than just the aesthetics  as the novels  main characters have been altered in major ways. fan-favorite cheery littlebottom  for example  is no longer a dwarf and is instead a human  which makes for a rather unnecessary species swap  lady sybil ramkin is a vigilante instead of an animal-loving  upper-class recluse  and angua von  berwaldhas has ditched her long blonde hair in favor of a shorter style to match her new angst-filled personality  which is a far cry from pratchett s more complex depiction of the character. loyal pratchett fans expressed their displeasure with these changes to the source material  including his daughter  rhianna pratchett. prior to the the watch s release  rhianna shared her thoughts about the show  saying   its fairly obvious that the watch shares no dna with my father s watch. this is neither criticism nor support. it is what it is.  writer neil gaiman  who collaborated with pratchett on the novel good omens  has also sided with disgruntled viewers  saying on twitter   its not batman if he s now a news reporter in a yellow trenchcoat with a pet bat. https   www.cbr.com bbc-the-watch-terry-pratchett-fans-anger-discworld
they re obsessed with  the message
if they wanted to piss off tolkien they should have just had everybody flying on eagles to accomplish every objective.
sorry for straying off topic but... your hair looks gorgeous  mel.
they learned from the best - jk rowling
I like you your take on the Bible verse. when you first read it  I immediatly thought   damn  the Bible is big on gains  talking about the need for a workout buddy .    take care!
3 11   everything there is to say about the current state of the modern entertainment industry.
I remember glenn beck talking about Gods of egypt  how it was going to replace charlton heston classic.  yet nobody saw it. I dont  think anyone remembers it.  so I say in three years nobody will remember this show.  so people should go and buy a copy of lotr and forget about any depiction.
all the diversity that exists in the many dungeons and dragons worlds thatshows fantasy is very open to all  people and instead of making a forgotten realms show they have to go after robert jordan and tolkien.
you do not simply walk into mordor.......
this is sick  absolutely sick
the power of slim shady will save the rings.
I loved the Bible verse at the end
they simply can not differentiate between esthetic aspects and ethic aspects    of an adaptation.
one does not simply change tolkien s work.
the Lord of the rings is the greatest fantasy series. however  its wrong. here s the correct version.  -amazon prime  rings of power.
they have another article showing they have never read past the third page of the fellowship
more than that. remind your elected officials about your dissatisfaction. even in the wokest of cities  I have seen whole school boards fired and district attorneys removed from office.
also never have I heard so much comon sense in a video from a person   especially the prat with the culture war I fully agree with you on that.
praying for your mom.
eminem should come out with a song called  one ring to rule them all.
are you doing a video on the new lara croft movie news  or lack of movie should I say
I cant believe they admittided it
the mmo is still goin n gettin better
the woke people have taken over a lot of institutions because they organize and show a vestige of solidarity.our side of the spectrum has been sorely lacking in both.sometimes you have to think beyond yourself and your own problems. sometimes its important to remember that if something can happen to your fellow  it can happen to you as well. so its important to put in extra effort to help your fellow when they re down  and not expect a  reward  or  compensation  for it.
preach  lecture   force everyone to become miserable like them
Im black and support everything you ve said. the way to beat this garbage is to standing together as one. dont support it  dont watch it....
Lord of the nostalgia bait
tolkien actually hated when they did fanfics back in his day. imagine the gasket he wouldve blown if he saw this garbage trying to subvert his own creation
no way Im even gonna pretend to watch a show in a world where sauron is played by a young eminem. no she-hulk for me either while we re at it. I guess she s more powerful than the hulk who at this point they ve basically turned to shrek. I like to pretend thatstar was doesnt exist now. and I dont see any hope for any of this changing anytime soon sadly.
they admiteded it!
guess what  I ll use their illogic against them.  maybe I cant relate to their show because they wont have a character that looks like me.  Imean exactly like me.  so  if they wont cast me  I wont watch their interstellardave-phobic show!
melanie mac   empty your mind  be formless. shapeless. like water.if you put water into a cup  it becomes the cup. if you put water into a bottle  it becomes the bottle. if you put it into a teapot  it becomes the teapot.now water can flow or it can crash. be water  my friend.                      bruce lee
very good choice of verses.
I dont think most people are gonna remember this show in a couple of decades. if anything  amazon s rings of power will stay in history as one of the most disrespectful to the source material shows ever created  along with all the resident evil live actions.
such an iconic bruce lee quote!
conversations  and  education  only goes one way with these people. reject their premise  dont give them an inch.
totally awesome video melonie
this photo with hobbits in the forest with 3 girls and this old guy... well  actualy it is realy picturesque scene with nice sunlight shining through the foliage but has nothing to do with pre-shire age hobbits. there were 3 hobbit clans - harfoots  stoors and fallohides. they lived in different areas. harfoots were farmers and craftsmen who settled close to dwarven settlements - so I asume on small hills near big mountains  stoors were fishermen who lived on the banks of tributaries of anduin  and fallohides were the actual forest tribe of hunters. so this wood tribe here should be named fallohides. but in this case they can not be played by darkskinned actors. becouse fallohides means literary  pale skins . so itseems thats why they chosen harfoots not fallohides to be their wood tribe. and I dont think that pre-shire hobbits settlements were in such a clime that they could use skirts made from grass like peoples in tropical clime. all their settlements were in the clime similar to the one of europe - from north italy  anduin tributaries   gondor   venice   north italy  to north sea or baltic sea   boreal forests of mirkwood area. so  congratularions on trying to live through cold part of year - from september to april - on the coast of nordic sea or baltic sea with just a bit of grass clothing on you  d  d
the worrying thing for me  is the  normies  I speak to about this really dont give a crap how loyal the showrunners are to tolkien s work.  they will lap this crap up and beg for more just because its content to consooommm.
to be fair  moderninity does sound better than modernity
they are fighting a won cause and want to be seen as heroes while they destroy something so great   majestic and complete .
for sure we do see ourselfs represented in certain types of people. and race is also a factor. but there is feelings  backgrounds and class differences. mothers of the whole world might look different and share different cultural values and language. but they all have in common that they are women and mothers. same goes for popculture. I love blonde  more nordic characters. but for decades  me as a german guy  also loved playing black woman in games or love asian culture. it was like that forever. im 25 now and this never changed. doesnt matter if im on the right or not. I dont need forced representation  so does no one else.this woke bullcrap kills it all.may God bless u melonie!
thank you for pointing this out mm! you are spot on we have to cal this dumb stuff out and stand against it.
the real slim shady isn t sauron there are leaks rumors about who is gonna play sauron .
its confirmed its not sauron. thatsaid. sauron or not sauron  wow what a haircut. wonder where the heck in middle earth do they get the barbers  and how they maintain that haircut in a medieval setting. never see anyone living in a place that doesnt have modern comforts to have barbers everywhere.also  tolkien fans dont need or want adaptations. much less a corporate fiction of an existing universe thats literally a life work of a man so catholic that he insisted to read the Bible in latin  and based on north west europe mythology  for england.edit  this is no story  this is pure narcissism and self-entitlement.
at least the actors made also abundantly clear that they dont care about tolkien s works  and that they are only salivating at the thought of being superstars and be set up for life with a multi-million  multi-season series that will make history  in their predictions . I bet thatsophia girl is already reharshing her speech for when she gets a star in the walk of fame at hollywood. absurd.
its the mac attack.
ya know  I wouldn t even care if they said it was an adaptation of tolkien s work and expanded the setting to include diverse ethnicities and whatnot. like sure  why couldn t there be dark skinned dwarves and elves in distant lands and distant times. what pisses me off is that they are taking well established characters and lore and twisting that to reflect their own idealology.
thats not sauron  its probably someone else.
red flag for me  all they talk about  showrunner and actors  is diversity. like I cantell this will be story diversity. pretty obvious where their priorities are.I grew up on sonic  teenage mutant ninja turtles  earthworm jim  bucky o hare  thomas the tank engine  biker mice from mars  street sharks  animaniacs and loony tunes  other than one episode of street sharks  there are no white male main characters. was I supposed to identify with all these animal characters based on something superficial or was it just strong characters and stories that I enjoyed  ppl are so brain dead about what entertainment is - its an escape not a mirror.
I never had an interest in watching this anyways  Im sure it will bomb
if it weren t for this show  I would never have realized how racist and close minded I am. thanks chubby trolls of wokenshire.
simple take your kids and show them the jackson trilogy or better yet read the lotr to them. never give prime a dime  pirate it if you have to watch it.this world like all other fantasy is meant to escape from this friggin  horrible reality. not to mirror it!
lawd dem rangzzz thatshit never gets old!
commenting again for the algorithm  gotta love when a megacorporation  franchises  tolkien for  content   a wholly new set of stories thatscrubs what tolkien actually wrote  even calling it the Lord of the rings only making their title a sub-title  his work becoming a palimpsest to much more digestible television to mainstream audiences  with amazon rop iconography dominating the cultural consciousness and all spaces and spheres of tolkien discussion and licensed as merchandise everywhere. its inappropriate. a co-opting  a hijacking  an appropriation.
yeah  I wonder who thought that haircut was a good idea.
I want to add that in  medieval setting  or in  ancient rome setting  we can get scissors and haircuts as well. you can find photos and papers about archeological finds of brushes and scissors of different times in real history - from wood  bones  or metal. of course tolkien elves were highly sophisticated civilisation with perfect art  they were meant by tolkien  read his letters  as the epitome of perfection in creating anything  so I asume that any adaptation should be showing them - at least - as fitting their hair as long  brushed  braided and sometimes jewellered. but those tv elves look like they d be haircutting by electric machines to impress american marines.  d
@tallis keeton  its not thatshort hair doesnt exist in medieval setting- they do! but not like... 1 cm or less from the skull kinda short. thats screaming modern already.. meanwhile elrond and celebrimbor haircut just makes no sense considering they re of royal blood  while not in succession to be high king  especially in case of celebrimbor  and that it was basically emphasized that elves have some sort of cultural importance in their hair.
yeah  sauron is that halbrand guy  according to nerdrotic  I think he saw leaked scripts for whole season.
the fact that they say its a reflection of the real world makes me laugh every time I hear it. nobody wants to see a fantasy to see a reflection of the real world. thats why its called fantasy!
are you a prime video subscriber  you know what to do.
arnold schwarzenegger was my favorite action hero growing up in the late 80 s and 90 s. despite us both being white  believe me. we look nothing alike. lolthese people s obsession with skin color is a clear example of why racism will never die. to put it plainly  they dont want it to.
man Imiss the early to mid  aughts
the more they preach  the more I want to talk shit without watching a millisecond of this series.
I think they should have renamed the woke lotr series  dungeons and drag queens  as it is more in keeping with modern identity politics and ideals  but maybe thats just me.
if tolkien didn t write it then it didn t happen
she s probably right  this series might be the future version of tolkien--crappy though it is   kids are not reading much these days  so slowly  the videos movies will take over completely  and the books will be viewed as quaint antiques.  bummer  man!
their reaction sounds like a defense mechanism against valid criticism. they are being defiantly stupid.
@jay flack   what can we do   spread the word !    spread the word to show the  normies  - who will watch the series anyway of course - that it is not a creative adaptation but a malicious ideological deconstruction of tolkien s esthetical and ethical ideas and values. unite to gatekeep !    unite to defent the beloved man s legacy !  unite to defend the truth  the truth of this universum  which they try to condemn  to smear  and to make as trivial as they can - by focusing it not on 4  great themes  of tolkien s mythopoeia but on trivial topics like gender and race. in today s tragic situation of western culture tolkien should be deemed as an ark of culture  as recently one of polish literary critics said in one a book of essays  and we fans should be honored to be deemed as guardians of the ark. I hope that all fantasy fandoms will help us  tolkienians to spread the word  to educate  normies . and never bow down  never bend the knee !  before amazon s travesty. - tolkien fandom stands alone. - not alone. fandoms ! - to the king !
Im so bored of incorrect casting. if they cant even get the cast they hire to look like the character what s the point  it totally kills it for me. hollywood has become multiverse of the downtrodden. the stuff they crowbar in for brownie points with existing ips  just to say they included a minority  or something for relatability  even when it doesnt fit. stan lee said it best  I wouldn t mind  if peter parker had originally been black  a latino  an indian or anything else  that he stay that way.   but we originally made him white. I dont see any reason to change that.  I think the world has a place for gay superheroes  certainly   but again  I dont see any reason to change the sexual proclivities of a character once they ve already been established. I have no problem with creating new  homosexual superheroes.  it has nothing to do with being anti-gay  or anti-black  or anti-latino  or anything like that   latino characters should stay latino. the black panther should certainly not be swiss. I just see no reason to change that which has already been established when its so easy to add new characters. I say create new characters the way you want to. hell  I ll do it myself.
nice applicable Bible verse insert.
romans 1 28   and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge  God gave the over to a reprobate mind  to do those things which are not convenient.   just remember  everything the people taking wokecain are doing they brought upon themselves  and they re all going to have to face the eternal penalty for it.
its  mod-urn-ity . just a helpful psa.
I really wish their show was tolkien canon but it is populated with moral exhibitionists  so it isn t canon. personally  Im skipping this mess.on the positive side  the memes are going to be glorious!
this show is everything tolkien despised  allegory  in all its manifestations. so this has nothing to do with tolkien.
mel plz report on the tr script leaks !!!
Im actually glad she was honest. first they admitted the show has no connection to the movies. but now they admit not the books either  lolol  its hysterical  but thats good.  Imean who wants this show connected to them. Imean it was clear from the start it is not connected to either. amazon wanted a social justice show that was super expensive and to slap the name Lord of the rings on it to lore in movie fans.  not book fans. that was never going to happen   the issue is the movies lead many who did not read the books into reading the books. and they thought wow this is better then the movies even.  I give peter jackson credit. because that is the best your going to get a Lord of the rings in live action. your never going to get it like the book. I dont think it can be done. what can be done is movies that gets as close as it possibly can becoming a movie thats great but still not the books. this show has nothing to do with the world I have loved my whole life. it is not cannon nor necessary for me to see that will add to the books. and for those who only saw the movies. you do not need to watch this show cause it will not add anything to the movies. this not a prequel to peter jacksons films. they flat out even said that. you dont need to watch it. its not cannon. the books are immortal. the movies and some old cartoons are to a degree. this new show is a publicity stunt that will die.
there is no one who looks like me. there is only me
I love spawn. so as a white dude am I appropriating black culture  or maybe todd mcfarlane is. its all so crazy
will do! I tweeted about it but cant make a video until tuesday as Im out of town
do folk of color really look at  the pj movies and think  nobody looks like me  this isn t for me  I cant enjoy this   pretty sure I  as a white dude  dont feel that way when I watch stuff with just mainly minorities in it. if I did  there wouldn t be a commercial out there today that would be for me.
it literally 5 seasons of dog sh t. its going to be tough to stomach and watch this.
the truly virtuous do not seek recognition or glory  as like the true followers of God will never gloat about their religion. God recognizes your deeds without fanfare as people will acknowledge what you do without the narcissism trumpeting your actions.
when I go see black panther 2  I wont be upset that yt people aren t in it.
they re redoing  bambI ... mummy kills the stag  bambI s dad  because he s an alcoholic and drug dealer plus human sex trafficker with a bad temper! mummy is a feminist who wants a fair world as long as you dont expect her to do anything and has her own forest with security fencing plus guards!   bambI goes trans and turns into the stag and destroys anything with common sense and decency.. stay strong fans! cheer s
I usually enjoy your videos  and I agree with you on most points  but its hard to take you seriously when you cant pronounce modernity correctly. its a dead giveaway that you aren t diving deep enough into the subject matter of wokeness. you cant refute the woke culture without understanding what it is and where it comes from.
well said!!
tolkien s work is totally 100  based on catholicism... wokeism wont stop trying to subvert his books. it almost looks like heiiywood let peter jackson s trilogy to reach the popularity that it has to tumble it down now. you know  the higher you climb  the higher you fall...
entertainment is a luxury. we re officially in a recession and possible depression. people are gonna waste money on necessities and good escapism and this ain t it. hollyweird is gonna get hit hard by this lesson while independent and oversees take over and rightfully so for all the bad crap they are trying to shove down peoples throats.
if you dont want to stick to the lore of the world go make your own series... tolkien s world is already diverse! elves  humans  hobbits  orcs.... there s plenty of diversity already.
I dont understand how show movie runners think it ll help their projects make money to come out publicly and say  we want such and such to reflect modern times .  Imean  do they not understand that the exact purpose of fiction is to escape the real world   why would I then watch your movie  since if I wanted real world politics  I d turn on the news   Im willing to bet nobody could provide even one example of when saying thatstuff actually helped a movie or show  so that would mean they know this  and are willing to trade profit for virtue signaling points.  sadly  as long as they view these virtue signaling points as a form of currency thats more valuable than money  we wont see any type of market correction.
youll enjoy my rings of power shorts
amazon  shitting on the shoulders of giants.
mel is too early for video posting
when will u b live on twitch again missing u
you want to see a movie with a diverse cast that doesnt rub it in your face  predator.
facts
all they want is for you to hate-watch the show.they need you talking about it. making it trend. allowing it to make money.do not oblige them.  do not watch it. do not let curiosity drop your beans in their bean counter. just dont watch.
they need to stop doing this to everything in hollywood! it just needs to be left alone  thats why if you cant make a good reboot or prequel series  then leave it alone! its not hard! its called fantasy for a reason  we need to escape  not come back to reality. we need to separate fantasy from reality here  people!
dem rangz of powerz
we are nowhere near a depression. we re barely even in a recession. its a correction and its much needed  because stocks cannot go up indefinitely.
admittitting is a thing. also...yeah  saw this coming from a mile away  especially with the eminem-ish sauron. like...what
lol  just a little help for you. its  muh - dern - ity . hope that helps.
its so far removed from what the Lord of the rings is you cant even refer to it as that. the worst part is they think they re doing something great but they re just crapping over everything and everyone. rings of failure is what I ll refer to it as.
crom damn it.
I cant wait for the premiere so I can not watch it.
that image of her is the antithesis of everything attractive. but please  educate the rest of us on  your truth .
oh man  now even the Bible is getting on my case about having no friends lol
I do kind of feel bad for the eminem look a like considering we all thought was sauron plus considering is a wahman  but shouldn t have buzz cut her hair.
hey melmac!! where s alf
the hubris... btw thats not sauron

just like the ring was cast into mount doom  and all the imperfections purged .......... ive cleansed one aspect of my amazon watchlist  which is a shame after seeing all the out coming developments  I was interested at first but now all that has been crushed between gollum s teeth. Imean were all about representation n all  but the fact is there are plenty of tv shows and movies with diversity in them  not every story has to have those aspects  does not mean the person who creates it is a racist  its just a world they created - its like just because a movie is mainly asian actors like say the live acted  space battleship yamatto   does not mean those characters are only accessable to asian people   does not mean I cant relate to kodaI  or his robot of all things.......  really after seeing all they are talking about im lost for words and how their thinking they basically think is the mental processing gospel of some how  todays world
blam...Imean boom
it happens to be my face  is such a psychotic comment to make
plot twist jussie smollett is actually sauron  pissed off because no one believed in his  this is maga country!!  little prank.
love and peace
seeing your butter skit on facebook alot. I like the skit alone  then these facebook  content  creators kinda just tag their skits with it. its bad  wish they could actually make original nice content.... most of them dont and just do the  I dint jiggle  videos which freaking annoying
the whole show is just a fan service! thats why we see galadriel warrior princess  hobbits  harfoots my ass   wizards  black elves and dwarves  and now a balrog and palantir! they dont care about the lore! they just thought about what characters  concepts and events made the original film trilogy famous  and re used them in their own make-up version of tolkien for profit and in telling the message.
lol they are so different that they cant come up with anything original
Lord of the rings in the 2000s were so amazing and now its just always these political stuff taking over media is annoying
its a trend in us an western society.
I will not support Lord of the woke  ring of the broke.  I hope it fails miserably.
melonie s fav character is the fat guy lol
the arrogance of those wokes makes me
the thing that pisses me off the most is how they keep saying they are the first to be doing something.. bitch please..
thats not sauron. but I totally agree.
you are awesome and beautiful
anakin skywalker brought balance to the force as well - he destroyed the jedi. sounds like that is what this show is trying to do to tolkien s work.
no see I think this will go down in history....the historical toilet bowl  if you will .
I am just glad thatseries is not connected to the peter jackson films.
melanie  not that I put that much importance on it  bt you an intp on any chance  your choice of words is weirdly similar to mine.
mo-dern-ity
its the narcissistic arrogance of these actors that is annoying me the most. they are so deluded in thinking they are actually revolutionising anything.this show needs to fail spectacularly and break the spirit of this false polictical correctness trend forever!
there is only one Lord of the ring and he does not share power.
this is narcissistic gaslighting
mo-dern-ity
sauron looks like vitas 7th element
this show isn t as good or important as amazon thinks it is. thats not something tolkien s fans can educate them on  we ll leave that to the ratings! I think I ll go read a book  instead. I ll say hello to the hobbits for amazon. take care.
well amazon doesnt care about the story  they care about their story.
same with the race swapping game of thrones show coming out
@david hutchinson  amen brother!
close! infp haha
@melonie mac go boom  close enough I guess
the narcissistic arrogance of these actors why are those birds singing like thats something that birds are known to do
I like you nails.
let s take a world that is full of diverse races and insert a bunch of humans of varying colors.... ermm  what.
looks like its going to be a cw show on steroids  including extra seasons nobody normal wants. nice content creation  amazon
its particularly bad with the new star trek series. they vandalize legacy characters
dude early ass post... anyways just coming on to say hello  Im kinda lost and having difficulties accepting myself and my own past...
nothing will change unless you say who  they  are. here is a hint. itstarts with a j.
when will you people finally understand that the austrian painter with the funny mustache was right
its pronounced modernity
this is not tolkien. just make a diverse cast fantasy film without the tolkien name and then let itstand on its own.
Im so happy that the Lord of the rings movie was back in the year of 2000 bc if it was out now and got a bad review that no one would ever see it and enjoy the movie and the characters in the movie. anyway I just want to say that bout Lord of the rings movie and I just want to say that the new ring of power is going to be awful and terrible than Lord of the rings movie and I think that I will never ever going to be watching the series ever  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to make a comment about this video that you have done  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that you have done a very great job with it and I just want you tell you that keep it up and I am so happy for you melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening and good night melonie.
imo the worst part of this whole  muh representation  bs is you cant do it back  it you call a move too black or too mexican or anything else your racist  but these days to white is a major problem

woke of the rings.... there should be a law against shit like this.
what a weird narcissistic society the western has became because of all this crap activism on media sns. you elect representatives and get your representation on politics  school boards  etc. not in movies entertainment. its weird a studio spend millions on cgI  stage construction  costumes making  everything to match what the original author described  but they refuse to do the same thing or have the same care with the characters  which are one of the most important role in the adaptation. what s the point in making a movie adaptation of a classic story if the only thing that will look similar to the original is the background  objects and costumes. shall we start also asking for places representations  shall I start screaming to see brazilian slump represented in middle earth   on the real world  now if a non-japanese girl uses a kimono  the left just start screaming that is  cultural appropriation  and try to cancel this poor soul  they even made baseball teams change their names. and what do you call what we are seeing now  trying to re-write history and change everything that was created to be an european mythology isn t cultural appropriation  rings of woke showrunners and cast are totally arrogant when talking about the show  they only talk about virtue signing  but they cant say anything right about the story. actors who call themselves  activists  and say that they are happy to be the same activist inside the movie should be banned from this kind show. if they want to be activists on the screen  go make a documentary for God sakes.
this show will fail harder then paramount  halo .
my friends  torrent power  fk amazon
moh der nit tee
they missed an opportunity to represent transmen by not giving the female dwarf a beard.
woke bullsh t like we already knew
I have been told that the eminem character is a woman and not souron... Imean  wow...talk about sticking it to the patriarchy so hard you become a man...
many thanks!!!
its simple appropriation. they do it because they no faith in other cultures mythology  their creativity  or their own originality. anything written in the view point of the easterlings would have been better.anything written in the aspect of new characters from different regions would have been more original  but that takes work  skill    effort.
another amazing franchise ruined buy the wokies...
this is gonna flop  big time
this is why I only refer to it as amazon s rings of power. its a lousy fanfiction that has nothing to do with tolkien or the Lord of the rings. the day this comes out is when I cancel amazon prime.
cultural appropriation!!!
not a reflection of tolkien s work  that just makes it that much easier to disassociate this garbage from the films and novels.
do not watch it! when you do  whether you love or hate the show  you ll count as a viewer and thats all that matters to them. cherish your finite time and attention  and dont squander it on another woke shitshow like this.
boycott em
I ll pass on this garbage show.
Im not subscribed to amazon prime and wont subscribe as long as this anti-tolkien monstrosity is available on it.  hopefully people will cancel in mass  if only for a few months in protest.
can we all cancel our amazon subscriptions  the day before this crap is released
this show is just a knock-off. same name worse product.
woman in charge of that project is jewish  that is all you need to know.
get woke go broke.  fight marxism where ever it appears  through feminism  critical race or gender theory  or socialism.
best thing people could do is not support this and maybe come together make our own content based on tolkens work. I hope people dont support this garbage and dont get sucked into this obvious gas lighting series. they dont want to make anything new just want to make money off something with zero respect for the source.
this looks bad. I have absolutely no problem with strong female characters and diversity but if its done without context and its shitsmeared on our face with some lame political point  thats it when show fails badly.
another failed cw script wearing a known ip  skinsuit. its re  halo  bat woman.... bad fanfiction is all it loks like to me.
for crying out loud   give the show a chance  its just some lame actors that dont know shit thats talking
also companies shouldn t change previously establish franchises instead they should create their own original stories  if they want to change things so much
