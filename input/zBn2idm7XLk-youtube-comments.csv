she hulk is a self-insert by admission  but that does thatsay about them  she s sad  angry  lonely  unloved  hates her life  hates her job  and can only achieve short-term gratification without true fulfillment. its actually quite sad when yourealize the show is a massive self report.
its ironic thatshe-hulk has more toxic masculinity than the male characters lmao
their attempts at damage control are funnier than anything in the show itself.
she could predict the criticism ahead of time  because it was true. all she really proved by putting those comments in ahead of time is she could see those same problems too. but rather than fixing them she thought if we try to shame people it ll make them go away. but unlike in she-hulk objective reality actually exists here  there is no way for her to complain and magically make the problems in the show go away. even if everyone stopped talking about the show  it d still be awful. cheers for the shout out
wow  people really dont like our show and we upset a lot of people. . . what should we do   tell them we made it bad on purpose.
this show made me feel much better about my own life.if the character is that miserable  its almost certain the writers  producers  directors  and actors are even more miserable  so Im actually doing okay! thanks  she-hulk!
so let s make it clear  they made the show bad on purpose so that fans would critisize it and now they re praising each other how smart they are for predicting negative reactions. wtf
they are so nice to make a show to give youtubers and critics a well-paid job
youtubers are now more respected critics than mainstream woke media
its not bad you just hate it because women are there later its bad just to trigger haters
I still cant figure out why making a show bad on purpose was green lit.
disparu very correctly pointed out that in the show  she-hulk broke the 4th wall so that the show-runner could talk to the audience  merely using jen she-hulk as a proxy . in every other movie  tv show  or comic book where the 4th wall is broken  it is done so that the character cantalk to the audience. very important distinction. and that is why the show was such a poorly executed version of what the john byrne comic books accomplished.
we have an epidemic of toxic creators and critics... not toxic fans.
this feels like the hollywood equivalent of  it was just a joke bruh! cant believe you fell for it hahaha!
I hate how this writer confidently thinks doing this would hurt anyone she looks so confident  I guess she doesnt even use any kind of social media
we did this to kill the franchise  so we can go back to producing obscure  artsy  films like we did in college.  thats how I read this article.
we knew we have absolutely no talent. so we accurately predicted the fans would say they didn t like our work and that we have no talent. got em!!!!!!!
honestly probably the best way to give the writers a sign their show sucks and get it to be canceled is to not even be a  troll . just dont talk about it and when whatever studio is producing itsees that its not even getting people that  hate watch  it  and therefore no negative comments  they cancel it because no one cares. when no one cares the studio doesnt make money on that time slot so thatshow is cancelled for something that will make money.
yes  another ip destroyed out of spite just to own the trolls. these people really hate these characters and more importantly they hate the audience.
also the writer admitted thatshe-hulk is a self insert. its like these people are just adult children.
I noticed that too - the show seems to hate everyone! certainly men are portrayed poorly  but women are also shown as superficial and catty  or  frenemies . there is no love for the lead character  who is made to endure a series of personal humiliations  and there is little concern for society as she-hulk is most frequently used for self-benefit. heroes and heroism are mocked or dismissed too. and for a disney show about superheroes - which one would expect to attract children - it has a lot of adult themes. one has to think this level of hostility originates from a group of deeply unhappy people lashing out at the people and society around them.
@guy gadbois  some people have God-shaped holes in their hearts  and instead of filling ithem they instead try to inflict thatsame emptiness on others.
yeah thats so true like how unhappy is jessica gao  lol
sad af
its an indictment of the american education system
@guy gadbois  I almost wondered if it was a low key satire because I find it hard to believe anyone would write a character so miserable and be unable to see the clear problems in her life and want to write them into something better.
nailed it
its so true.
nuff said
yeah seriously. its like the creators weren t actually mad about sexism  but that they weren t the ones on the side with all the power over the other gender.
lmfao they were projecting their true colors outwardly while spending what over a 100mill
pretty much every female character in media for the past decade or more has been that  take the most toxic asshole man and gender swap and then we re supposed to celebrate the character. no  those of us who actually see people as equals do not like those characters no matter what gender race they are.
@ne01lnwolf69twin85   225 million precisely
the idea of toxic masculinity is just some wine-mum s idea of her ex-boyfriend.
sad thing is  there are people that deny the show is a self insert  and is accurate to the comics. Ive had to tell them that jessica goa has literally referred to she-hulk as  my avatar . they still deny it  lol.
like a lot of people  I have trouble wrapping my head around the concept of making a show bad on purpose just to mess with your critics.  what a waste of everyone s time and resources--not to mention trashing your own reputation.  it didn t take long for most of us to realize that the problem with many of these shows isn t that we fans are toxic  its that the creators are toxic.  creativity is supposed to be the supreme act of human beings  literally making something out of nothing  and jessica gao has taken this opportunity to throw a big girl spite tantrum.  the only person gao appears to hate more than marvel fans is herself.  I thought I d seen it all  but wow  was I wrong.
@ellen  self loathing is a very powerful force
the series is sounding like a cry for help at this moment
and literally needs help loopholes to achieve success
must be nice to use disney resources for self therapy.
@david smith  could be - I hadn t thought of that. their satircial style seems to be more of the  in your face  type like with the kevin robot than low key  but maybe. I also thought there might be a character development arc where she d grow out of selfishness into being a hero and find satisfaction in life that way  but that didn t happen at all  instead she broke the 4th wall and re-wrote the world around what she wants  even kidnapping daredevil into it. great lessons for the kids  lol.
@guy gadbois  yeah  given all the comments by the creators Im sure this is not the case. but under other writers  a few tweaks would actually make it a brilliant satire
g4 tv strategy so you know where this was going let s see what s next that likes to use the hate your fans strategy.
jessica gao described she hulk as her  avatar  so yeah is kinda a narcissistic show.
@ace max  I hope they all get fired aswell
@guy gadbois  wow!  that analysis blows me away.  I didn t even consider that.  the writers have to be deeply troubled narcissists to write this stuff.
@hakims haberdashery  why exactly
@guy gadbois  thats hilarious!
@josu  patI o  100  on point.
@duncan mcokiner wow! that was one of the most wisest youtube comments I have ever read. well played
@duncan mcokiner  your comment reminded me of heart-shaped box by nirvana. great song.
well said
@thefatman69fude  she s so self-deprecative she thought she wasn t good enough to play herself in the last episode and just hired someone else lmfao
jessica gao should quit writing  take up knitting  buy about 25 cats and spend her time ranting about men on twitter while screaming at kids who are playing quietly on the street.
she s sad  angry  lonely  unloved  hates her life  hates her job  and can only achieve short-term gratification without true fulfillment. narcississm in a nutshell. xd but I doubt narcississts can be sad. this kind of people sure can be angry  but they rather cant feel sadness. sadness is somewhat related with shame  and they dont have any. at all. all they have is ego that goes beyond event horizon and complete lack of self-awarness. so yeah  maybe it is possible for them to feel anything more than anger and pride  but it must be rare as all hell at this point..
@_night in gale_  oh no  these people feel horrific sadness. but they just deny and bury it.
@guy gadbois  and the creators of saints row. they d all get on really well. they could all sit around  being crap together.
@duncan mcokiner  thats right! they are hella miserable but they repress it from their consciousness. thats why they tend to be aggressive whe you try to reason with them  they hate and fear to hear the truth about themselves . good thing you clarified that.
@_night in gale_  and its why they see people trying to help them live a spiritual and physically healthier life as evil  hateful monsters. its like they re going through every stage of grief at once ad nauseum  aside from acceptance.
@ronnie patterson   its always by folks that never been around a real one any length of time.  were you
oh yeah  a loved one is married to one. been witnessing the tears   carnage for about 10 yrs now. so sad how kids are used by those monsters to keep supply intact smh @_night in gale_
sad   nope   if someone does that for real with a show   this person deserve everything that make that person   feeling bad .
and she sleeps with anyone she can and thinks that   a relationship
I dont get these people making shows now. just try to to put out a good show  if fans dont like it just say ok. work on their craft come back with something better  they wouldn t be getting any shit from fans
and she doesnt even want to be a hero at least
and she only cares about herself.this behavior is supposed to be regarded as heroic.
so youre saying she s the average
if they did this but in the comic book way l.a hollywood lifestyle which had the toxicity type humor in it but real action story  balanced it would of been alot better
@duncan mcokiner  please dont bring religion into this
@digI shade  seethe.
@duncan mcokiner  funny that you felt the need to react in a mocking and what could be called aggressive manner to a polite request to not bring in something that had nothing to do with the conversation almost seems like youre the one doing the seething
I think you just described most people s lives in a nutshell. so this show really should be the most relatable show marvel has ever put out.
@digI shade  my brother in Christ  you talk like youre trying to meet a word count. its not remotely polite of you to passive aggressively attack people s religions. you came into a Christian space and demanded that Christianity not be discussed.
@duncan mcokiner  Christian space right 1. I dont see this video discussing anything to do with Christianity 2. I didn t attack your religion I asked for you to not bring it up  mainly because it has no relevance to anything in this comment section
@digI shade  God isn t the answer to everything  well  he s certainly not the answer to 2 2  but he is the answer to the God-shaped hole in your soul.also  everyone is varying degrees of an asshole. there are no truly  good  people on an objective level. the difference is thatsome people work harder at being good than others  and trust God to forgive their failings.
let s not forget the finale where the protagonist has characters punished for things she knows for a fact they were created and compelled to do and makes daredevil into her sex puppet. creepy.
@duncan mcokiner  why do you have to make religion part of it
@sup  I will always praise she ra and the princesses of power for how they imo perfectly wrote their strong female characters. everyone felt real. everyone had flaws and strengths. everyone was pretty much equal imo  even though a majority of the characters were women . women weren t treated as better than men  men weren t treated as better than women. itseems like that is what true feminism started out to be bit nowadays shows like she hulk generalize all men as stupid a holes  the very thing feminists nowadays hate  generalization  and all women as being right and getting everything they want in the end
@sup  meanwhile  fortnite...
thats a usual standard for women. they ll enforce some toxic masculity subconciously. how many women have left their man when they saw him cry  or considered a man weak for crying  dont rely on pc answers from them  rely on actions.
@kyle curcio  because Godlessness is at the heart of the issue  Im Christian  and the channel Im commenting on is Christian. I ll never understand people who get so triggered over religious people just expressing a basic belief that they feel the need to ask  why bring religion into it
yes  Ive never seen a woman called out to reply with  I was joking  when you clearly know they weren t.
facts
the funniest thing in the movie was mr immortal yeeting himself out the window to get away from the two ignorant harpies thatsomeone managed to sneak into a law firm.
@fatgoat  its as if  a woman s yes means no but yes but no but yes  is true  right  who would have thought
@nagalior  im a women and that crap is confusing lol
if the show was bad on purpose  then why did jamila bragged about the show being number 1 in some unverified app list  and then going on defending the shit hulk show
@e-satan  simple. they noticed all of the negative feedback so decided to double down and state they meant to make the show bad the whole time to make itseem like they know what they re doing and sound in control  not realizing it just blew up right in their face. any production that willingly admits to  making a show bad on purpose to anger trolls  is not something I would ever follow again. I ended my disney  subscription.
@hr lfr  and how does that  making a show bad on purpose  play to the bean counters that currently run disney bob chapek paycheck gets criticized for being a numbers guy and focusing on profit. making a show so bad that 1  disney loses money on the production 2  it drives people away from the service. sounds like something chapek would not approve of. if the loss from this show reaches his level  can we expect him to make changes in those running the division that green-litshe-hulk s self-indulgence
lol ik thats like a dude saying I didn t cheat because Im a piece of shit I cheated because I wanted to test our relationship to see if it could survive cheating
trying to make sure disney doesnt think the show sucked and believes it was a fluke  so they can get season 2 confirmed
another real one in the comments. love your videos too.
she didn t though. it is just cope.
many of the comments from the trolls on the show were complete straw man arguments no true fan disliked she-hulk from the comics. we would never say   she doesnt deserve her powers   or thatshe was  taking the job from a male superhero   because she-hulk is a beloved female character  unlike carol danvers  whom those arguments do apply to  one could argue.
this is an excellent point.means they full well know what they are doing is wrong.
disparu as always  top quality commentary.
@the lone space marine  the emperor protects.
if they are mad at the critical drinker  thats not going to go in their favor at all lol
you gotta love how oblivious these people are.while they are toasting themselves on  trolling the trolls  they are responsible for one of the lowest rated shows  and losing money for their company.
its such a ridiculous argument. all it means is thatshe may be a little self aware of her own stupidity. that is all.
this is literally the wojak meme of the guy rage crying while wearing a smug mask.  the cope is off the charts.
I was thinking the same thing hrolfr  its sloppy and amusing.
@levI ackerman  and we will see if losing money is enough for disney to change direction.I d like to think disney top brass got an earful of how  socially conscious  new shows  must  be  and all that.  and maybe some of the higher ups believe that  too.  but now that the ratings are in the higher brass see that that approach loses money.will those that preach this message get replaced  will the higher-ups thatsupported this message get replaced  will they be convinced that  the message  is still vital but the she-hulk writers just did a bad job
I kinda liked it. its faithful to the comic and its silly. especially madisynn.she stole the show. could ve been better. but its nowhere near as bad as everyone is saying.
and I normally hate anything with ham fisted  messages  especially girl bosses. but its a charming show.
it almost feels like gao made a bad show so she d have something to complain about. so she can say  see all the hate we re getting! I was right! just as I predicted!
such a genius idea
thats exactly what happened
isn t that like making a faulty bridge and then surprised when it doesnt work. then tell people it was made faulty on purpose
the reaction of an emotionally unstable teenager ........ coming from  adult professional  workers in the tv show production world.
@frank bazeley  this sounds like and excellent way to end up in prison  lol.
sounds like something an 8 year old would say
us    is thatsupposed to be a damn surprise     nobody could make a show that bad by accident!
yup. thats how I interpret as well.
I would love to see a factually  checked  video that could actually show 3 years ago they said hey   lets make she hulk bad. we know that  folks will hate it  and  we will blast them and say we planned this . .
if the show is that bad  people are not trolling it  they are just telling facts. the writers predicted the truth  how genius of them  smh.
yep  they outsmarted the trolls and sucked all the vital fluid out of them.
I believe the spirit of andy kaufman would be proud of them.
dont forget  they  supposedly  told marvel execs about their idea to make a bad show just to troll strangers on the internet  and marvel agreed to give them millions of dollars.
who is andy kaufman
give me a year  and I ll never understand that kind of thought process.  but then  Im a rational and reasonable human being.
@nimz  uh  no.  no.  andy wouldn t have pulled shit like this.  he still sought to entertain people  not piss anyone off out of spite.
@                    somebody before your time.  some people called him crazy  and Im still wondering if they were right or not.
they just want negative attention.
@todd taylor  not if they re women
what s really funny  is by admitting they made it bad intentionally  they admitted it was bad. which makes anyone who defended it or said it was good  look even worse. like nah bro  you just have shit taste or no taste  because they admitted it was bad.
@attacker angel  except women dont do contruction.
@                    jim carrey s inspiration.
narcissists! they didn t know that. she knew she couldn t succeed so she made something so outrageously bad knowing that any publicity is good publicity. they couldn t create an amazing show and they knew a mediocre written show wouldn t get publicity and conversation so they resorted to total shock value to get us talking. they re lazy and tired!
100       kinda like going up and spitting in someone s face and then saying  yup!  I just knew you d be pissed off when I did that!!!!
lol its like giving yourself a pat on the back when you predict that when you serve your partner a plate of literal shit that they will hate it and respond to that negatively
I could understand them making a good show and making little jabs here and there at the toxic fans. but this is just sad. there were people who legitimately wanted this show to be good  and it just ended up being used as a vehicle to shit on a small percentage of fans.
got em! lol

they re living rent free in the writers  heads
she hulk had so much potential
@shinku gouki  nop
@hakims haberdashery  she hulk could have been a badass show
doomcock certainly profited off of this.
@shigermuleye  she-hulk a kids show  ok groomer
@shinku gouki  the source material  yes  the show  no
@marco genovesi   if they would have stuck to the source material  the show would have been great
and they fear that. big time.
always have been
agreed
this is among the reasons why the indie industry is becoming popular right now.
@yukI nagato  research is time and energy consuming  I respect that. what I see in amazon rop is that many of amazon creators did not familirize themselves with existing studies so proper enhancement of base material on screen was not actually possible. since tolkien s story is massive  proper approach is required. amazon did not do that.
@tunebeat  well if the big companies produce shit  then the small ones  indie  will start to rise and take the place of the big companies  if they dont fix the problems  aaah beautiful capitalism
honestly  some random guy recording with a crappy phone camera on his own bedroom  is a far more respected than mainstream woke media because at least his opinions are genuine  no shilling  no agenda
@hakims haberdashery  no operation
blessings in disguise
doomcock will have another pool full of money
anyone can do a critics job literally anyone and everyone is a critic
@frank gomez  indeed! critical thinkling allows mindful discussion
it wasn t. they re just mad that everyone said it was trash and didn t lap up their propaganda.
but they said it was a great show  best thing from the mcu  the other day. which is it  lol
they literally congratulated themselves in the show for basic writing.  connecting the a plot and b plot  nice!  they also admitted they couldn t write courtroom drama  or know how to hire a consultant. that didn t write this bad on purpose. they re just that incompetent. you could literally hire random women on the street and they d do a better job than this just by not being insufferable  entitled  and arrogant. they wasted tens of millions of dollars  and even more than that in fallen disney stock  all just to troll youtubers and be a misandrist piece of sh t. this is what a dying company looks like.
they ll never know the sacrifice you made
investors money
lol. they definitely didn t do it on purpose. look at the reviews online. the only people who seem to like it  excluding the bots they clearly used to pad out the score  are either super casual watchers who have no idea or people with apparently a missing sense of humor. the show is objectively bad as a  comedy.  the creators claiming they wrote it bad on purpose is a lie.
Im sure its just cope on their part  lol. like a little kid   oh Imeant to do that!
it wasn t  this is cope.
they absolutely made it bad on purpose. I suspected as much halfway through the show just based on the fact that half of jen s fourth-wall comments are her praising or making excuses for the show s writing. it was like they knew a lot of their creative decisions would be poorly received.
@jonathan dunston  its been reported by marvel insiders that the show was considered to be so bad that they held back its debut by a couple months so that they could do reshoots. would be interesting to know what all was added during those reshoots.
@anonymous cheese  both! because of their cognitive dissonance!!!
disney executives saw a decent ip and wanted to make some money.jessica chow saw an opportunity to vent her undeserved  rage  at the submissive  patriarchy  because a small amount out of men in the world haven t treated her the way she wanted  but said she could bring the ip to life on the small screen in a way fans of it would enjoy.by the time disney figured out they had f---d up hiring her it was to late and they were stuck with a dumpster fire they had to try to sell as a good product to all the possible  new viewers who heard it was trash
@eirik bloodaxe  who everyone speak for yourself you dont speak for us
that comic was garbage..
toxic creators. critics and fans are literally the same thing  and the sooner that disconnect is cleared up  the sooner we can focus on cleaning up these creators
you are right...there s creators like melonie mac who is a troll...she talked bad about rop b4 it came out...and it was a good show...these people r not fans...they r publicists who have associations with different channels.
100  correct...the real fans r being influenced by troll critics and youtubers like the quartering
@aliensandspaceirl  are you hate watching  lol haha!
we have both  unfortunately
@heikira  I watch this chick because shes cute and I like small girls
@aliensandspaceirl  hate stroking then  that actually makes it worse lol
@aliensandspaceirlrop is only a good show if you have low standards and are caught up in the pretty shots and flashy scenes. it lacks substance and depth.
@therhysstreams  rop is awful  thats why it has a billion viewers  ...I saw it..its better than top gun maverick
@anonymous cheese  lacks substance and depth  no you r wrong...as some1 who actually saw the show..you r 100  wrong
@aliensandspaceirl  have you ever considered that it has so many views for the same principle that people cant look away from a train wreck  creators monetizing that abortion of a show  and people watching and laughing at how bad it is. I guarantee you the percentage of people that are watching it and loving it is extremely small. also  it accumulated that many views because its riding off a beloved ip. something that these directors could never create from scratch from their blood  sweat and tears like tolkein did. its an insult to tolkein that any of these talentless hacks are allowed anywhere near that ip.
@gmu_alum08  so the show is bad because the writers came from bad robot  is that your reasoning ...I dont care lol I liked it and I read the silmarillion...inreally dont care what you think...rop wont get canceled...all the haters watch anyways lol
exactly
@aliensandspaceirl  tbf studios were caught buying out tickets to their own movies  that got hushed real fast. I believe the numbers are being fluffed. money is a universal lubricant. and their will be a second season   only many writers will be replaced and the same with the actors.
nobody just gives up on a billion dollar investment.
but they say that wonder woman was written badly  especially the first one  and is why gal gadot refused the 3rd one. the 2nd one was them transitioning to wokism. their 4th one is supposed to be full wokism.
@aliensandspaceirl  she talked bad about it for 2 reasons  1- yes  for attention 2- and because it was bad
@aliensandspaceirl  the show is so good all its fans are spending their time trying to convince everyone else its not garbage... makes sense  lady.
to be fair  there are some toxic fans. but they are the type that has always been toxic  always gotten obsessive  or taken things too far to meet someone. every performer has had to deal with those types  and they aren t really new news. thatsaid  this new trend of gaslighting any criticism as toxic is ridiculous  the real problem is that the narcissistic personalities prevalent in hollywood cant take criticism.
@silvus sol  bingo!
@aliensandspaceirl  well  youre obviously easy to please if you d call rop good.  you do you.  but please dont disrespect the majority who disagree and think the show sucked  dont call melonie a troll because she saw all of the same warning signs that many longtime fans did.  it was going to be another politically motivated  uncreative dumpster fire  and lo and behold!
@heikira  thatsounds creepy as hell  but I wouldn t be surprised!
@lex ruptor  I wish it was as simple as that  but we have to factor in the  professional  critics aka the shills who will gush on anything from disney or amazon or whoever to get certain indulgences and be invited to all the best shindigs.  in thatsense  the shill critics working for whatever newspaper or online rag are just as toxic as the people they bow down to.thats why a lot of fans have had to take it upon themselves to be critics  and their honesty makes them really different from the  pro  critics who tow the corporate political whatever line.
well a bit of both to be fair
@lex ruptor  critics. aren t. fans.
agree
@lex ruptor  I think he means professional movie   cinema critics that get paid to blow into marvel s ass .you know all the  true  critics who only give good ratings even when the show is dogshit .
you are spot on and the people who claim critics and fans are the same have no clue tf they are talking aboutcritics are paid to make a review and in recent years are paid to give good reviews  while the fans pay out of their own pocket for thing they deem worthy of their dollar. the idea that critics and fans are the same is one of the dumbest stuff I heard this week
more of a  jokes on you  Im not stupid  I was pretending to be stupid all along.    they  obviously  wont be making it any better in any way or form.
even if it was meant to be a joke all along  pissing of the people who you want to watch it is not the best way to get praise either. they fucked themselves on both ends.
funny  I never watched it. so  jokes on you gao.
dont be a menace clip below.https   www.youtube.com watch v nesewccpy1yseems more like this   aaaaaaahhhhhh  hahahaha. Im foolin yaall. I was jus foolin yall. those was just jokes. wheeeeeeeeew. wheeeew
the fact that the emojI got slanted as well
its a lie  they wrote shit  filmed shit  and posted shit to their servers. they actually thought it was bad and re-wrote everything and thought this version was better.
its just immature. if I shit my pants with the intention of fishing for a response  its not going to change the fact I shit my pants.
we totally owned the critics by making them a boatload of cash
the only ones they hurt were their imaginary boogie men
let s waste 225m on a stupid show to troll the randos on the internet  that will be an epic win  she will realize what she did  just like whomever woke movie director who made a woke movie  I dont remember either names  who said he was praised all around for doing a such a woke job but no one would ever call him to work on anything again  now that I think of it it might have been the last terminator movie
@gastndorf  ah  tim miller  who directed terminator dark fate. he d proudly said that the female terminator would terrify closet misogynists. then the film flopped so badly its credited with finally ending the franchise. he had a recent interview where he admitted he was  wrong - though of course his reasoning was that he d been wrong to think people would want to see a good movie  lol. since the film he s just made an animated series for netflix and been one of the many producers for the 2 sonic films.
@eirik bloodaxe  exactly. the fnt crew seem like they couldn t believe their luck to have two prime lolcows land in front of them at the same time in she hulk and rings of power.
Imean they did trigger people  tons of people actually. people took hours out of their week to complain about it for being  woke
thats the problem with closed circle  they only get echo chamber for their works and thinking  they think they re so  smart  and  brave  giving this.... things to public. meet too many people like that in my life
where. they spawn
only twitter
only person they re hurting is themselves
@theasylumcat  why is this so funny  its true and a great point. but damn it I cant stop laughing
and all at potential risk of not insignificant financial loss to the company  its investors and shareholders  just for kicks and giggles  how is it these people still have jobs
yes  but they hate themselves most of all.
hit the nail on the head.these people use stories people love as ammunition in a culture war and dont care in the slightest about the collateral damage to fans and fandoms  or the fallout that taints a property and fandom for years.
@nick napolithey are the trolls.
tbf I dont think they care one way or the other about the characters  the characters are merely a tool to use to make everyone else as miserable as they are
they hate themselves and their lives even more...
@billy william  beat me to it. the lefts ilk think righteous criticism is trolling. she hulk only trolled disneys shareholders.
@pelinore geryon  george soros the wef and davos.
they dont hate the audience  just the nazis acting like they speak for us normies lol.  highfive
irony is they seem to hate other women too. certainly any that disagree with them.
wouldnt it have been a better use of time and money to make something good for your loyal fanbase than to  own  what they say is a small out of touch fringe minority
@syver reborn  its not a show but rather a platform of influence
@anthony  pretty much what I was saying
and they hate themselves.  no one would make a show bad on purpose if they didn t.
tf  speak english sir. I dont understand q speak. @billy william
@syver reborn  absolutely correct. the property matters not because whatever it is becomes a mule to load down with their baggage.
@anthony  these people serve a master who subsists on negative energy. the more rage and anger they can whip up  the more bountiful the offering.
again sir  english!!! your buzzwords are interesting but kinda silly when used in a sentence my guy lol. bugmen  slaves  darkened reprobate minds kinda work  but nwo  my guy  they aint been thing since what 2000  hell  hulk would probly need a damn walker to get to the damn ring- muchless wrestle. @billy william
@ronnie patterson  youre ev...
@ronnie patterson  ...il sub...
@ronnie patterson  ...human...
@ronnie patterson  ...garb...
@ronnie patterson  ...age.
now you getting it. please leave these   quit deleting your corny shiit. seriously  it looks like im talking to myself everytime you do that!  highfive @billy william
@anthony  yeah but trying to actually do something good is too haaaaaaaaaaaard.
it wasn t destroyed out of spite. the attempted to create a great show but failed miserably.
lol  not to butt in  but where are you folks getting all these so called  failure  stats from  its wierd  the legit reviewers have mixed but mostly positive reviews on it  yet sites like this always talking about how  the fans hate it lol. what fans hate it    wheres these failure stats you guys can share  @marc williams
@ronnie patterson  Im merely repeating what the creators themselves said about fans  responses. and what failure  stats  did I cite
the creators werent talking about the fans responses  they were talking about sites like this    the folks that believe the sites are being truthful  which would be the anti- fans lol. how could you not know this  especially with she hulk spelling it out for you  as for stats  you dont have them  yet you claim its a massive failure. so thats  2  things you clueless about  yet your comment was posted anyways. not trying to be a smart ass  but. . . .Imean. . . cumon dude.  @marc williams
@ronnie patterson  bro its not fab response its fab viewership. also just so you know even feige and jennifer goa who produced the show know it is a failure based on how low viewership numbers were. Imean it didn t even make the list for show viewership and thats as itscored lower than ms marvel and basically every other show marvel put out. thatsays it all man. so next time you want to come all high and might to an argument make sure you have all the facts
fair enough mr  facts  haver. you got any links to prove that  or you just repeating nonsense from haterville  @dominic belton
@ronnie patterson  I dont need to prove it with a link marvel s reactions to this event says it all. also thanks  but Im not a hater I just remember og films like edward norton s incredible hulk which laid the ground work for the entire she-hulk series and the rest of the mcu to muddle it up.  Imean if youreally want to talk Im probably more of a fan than you anyway so
exactly! I knew you couldnt link me to anything to back up your claims lol. thats the haters game 101. I get a kick out of the snowflake antI - fandom sites always talking the  fans  think this  the  fans  say that  etc. etc. lol. im like omfg  quitsaying the fans think what you anti- fans think cause they actually dont  hence she hulk doing just fine  with you or this site unable to proove otherwise lol  highfive @dominic belton
@ronnie patterson  well Im not an antifan thank you Ive seen just about every show  movie  and cartoon marvel has put out. the problem is though that there is an obvious difference in quality. for instance iron man was way better than the eternals or even the second doctor strange. this shouldn t happen  but it does because production teams spend more time on effects and other dumb stuff than writing an eloquent storyline. Imean its not even like we re expecting a tarantino film just make an accurate story arc for each character.
the sad part I how many so called  fans  fail to see that.....
@ronnie patterson  waitso where is your proof the show was successful
@ronnie patterson  also make sure to provide stats and info on how financially successful it was in comparison to both shows and movies
lol  dude I dont know  nor care how much money disney  makes. thatshit antI -fans are into. us actual fans just watch it  then go about our daily lives not dwelling on the shit  whether its good or bad. @dominic belton
@ronnie patterson  bro your no actual fan your just lazily calling yourself a fan without understanding the context of what your watching.
@ronnie patterson  bro also learn how to spell. I literally dont know how Im maintaining a conversation with some with like a third grade literacy level.
ok wtf does redundant mean  is it kinda like  being repetitive or boring  also in the dark wtf dumbly means  as well as wtf a dullard is. now thats settled  I actually do know wtf you talkin about when it comes to the impact of a good movie   especially so when reading a good book. that being said  is that why you guys cant seem to hate this series enough  cause it doesnt have oscar worthy  acting  or pulitzer worthy writing  is that really wtf you expecting from a series called she-hulk attorney at law         my guy . . . uhmm @dominic belton
@ronnie patterson  you obviously cant understand basic ideas if you have yet to understand that Ive already explained that a stories development or how they integrate the storyline is what makes a show or movie great. also it makes no sense that you cant figure out what words like redundant means when your literally using a search engine to respond. literally  this is the true purpose of google.
well  . . . at least I aint a fraud that falls back on search engines to spell big words @dominic belton
@ronnie patterson  first of all I dont need search engines to figure out words. however  you most definitely need one to figure out what Im say. how about you use basic comprehension skills and actually learn from this conversation. all you ve actually proved from this is that you cant read and process a simple statement given to you. not to mention you cant even back up your own argument.
@ronnie patterson  also how about you focus on educating yourself because you have the writing skills of an infant before trying to throw something my way. obviously you must need google if you cant understand the concept of redundant which by the way does not mean repetitive.
sooooo  the rarely used word  redundant   is really just a lamer way to say the often used word  repetative  then  smgdh its all coming togeather now. thatsearch engine is really doing a number on you   your kind. yall believe being an anti- fan is the same thing as being a real fan  cause redundant is the same as repetative - lmfao!!!   thats not the way thatshit works slick.   oh btw  I hrd the God awful failure  called she hulk  has been nominated  by the real fans  for a coveted peoples choice award                  @dominic belton
@ronnie patterson  yeah bro look at the selection though its up there with a bunch of flops including house of the dragon and rings of power. ha! ha! youreally thought you had something there. all that proves is that the quality of tv shows has gone done. Im so sorry for you my guy. also again redundant doesnt mean repetitive. I hope maybe one day you develop some kind of standard so that you may understand that quality does matter. instead you just want to watch a show to kill a couple brain cells without actually wondering what is happening.
@ronnie patterson  bro also define antifan for me. also give me some proof that you are anything close to a fan. also again prove your argument thatshe-hulk was successful because you have yet to show any proof the that the show was successful
@ronnie patterson  yeah there is a difference between watching a show because it is popular and actually liking a show. you think because a show gets viewership it is liked and that is not true.
@ronnie patterson  see you argument is basically pathetic because you cant actually prove the reception was good. all you can prove is that a lot of people watched the show. but then you want to call me an antifan after the tons of proof there is saying the exact opposite. how about we talk about the scenes jennifer gao put in which attacked fans that dont like the show. that there is proof of a wide reception or why did she even react so unprofessionally
@ronnie patterson  yeah bro because just cause you watch a show doesnt mean its liked. its like just cause you say you  ronnie  are a fan doesnt mean that we all have to believe you. see your stuck in this delusion that everyone has to feel how you feel and thats a lie. some of us have different opinions to yours and we re fans too  but we also have a right to voice how we feel
@ronnie patterson  also when did the writers once put anyone in their place. you act like these people are being attacked. all anyone is asking is to make a show based loosely off the comics that will do the characters justice. this is not what we got from the mcu
the writers put you antI fans in yalls place- hence yall upset  while fans get a good laugh at yall. and yes yall did attack this show right when it was announced    yall researched she hulk was indeed a female character lmao. theres a ton of antI fan sites like this  that picked apart every scene  multiple times per day of the frggin. . . .wait for it . . . the trailers!!!!! lmfao  bubblelyfe @dominic belton
@ronnie patterson  bro what are you on   first of all you still keep using the term antifan but how about you define it. second  I dont know if you see yourself as an antifan  but Im not. I just provide my honest opinion on how shows like she-hulk perform. and honestly if you cant deal with that idea you shouldn t be on youtube. also bro this isn t a site  its a platform. there is actually a difference in the two. youtube is the site  however the content creator provides the platform. all Im saying if you want to be emotional about people not liking the same show as you maybe you should get your priorities right and focus on making yourself a better person. instead your here having a tantrum all over this platform. but lucky for you Im here to set you right.
lol  so you deduced from calling out my spelling  to explanations of what the term website   platform really means  without addressing the subject at hand  gee whizz  didnt see that one a coming lol. try again kid. this time stick to your previous comment about nobody attacked she hulk    I countered with endless nitpicking of trailers before the first episode aired lol. side note  I get its the bubblelyfe way to delect when you are wrong  but untill you start making sense  this hole will keep getting deeper   deeper. js @dominic belton
@ronnie patterson  I find that funny because you still have yet to present proof that the show was successful. so why dont you do that honey and let the men do what they need to do.
gee I wonder why she hulk turn out to be a man hating but still desperate for male attention wine mom who hate her life and is always eating and drinking in every scene. it was jessica gao all along
Im surprised she said woman and not birthing person   that killed me
you would think the goal of a writer for a tv show would be one of 3 things   1. to entertain  this should be for all shows   2. to inform  for your non-fiction   3. to convey a message  not in every show but in most shows  a value set is present .  also  maybe to make you think.  thats not necessarily a message because it could be an academic type show instead of a moral dilemma.if I was the head of a studio  I would not want a writer who said their goal was to tick people off.  that would seem like they re in the wrong business and going to drive away your consumers.  no consumers   no movie.  no movie   close or sale of studio.  close or sale of studio   no job for studio head.
thank you melanie. you said what I was thinking. and since Im a male in today s society  none of my opinions are valid  so thank you as a female for calling out the bullshit. why marvel would like to alienate and insult their core audience is beyond me  but they can go ahead and fall back on their modern female audience. I am sure that these exceptional women will not drive the company to bankruptcy lol. as for me  Im done with marvel. cancelled disney plus and everything. Im tired of being disrespected. but again thank you for having sense and awareness on our behalf. we men appreciate you sis!
the she-hulk writers wanted us to have contempt for them  mission accomplished.
these people are so narcissistic they took an ip that was popular  wrecked it  inserted themselves into it because they thought they were interesting enough that people would want to see them  then gloated about how they did it all on purpose to take out their anger on fans who dont suck up to them at every turn. Imean wow. just wow.
what if they had done this show 100  serious  like law and order but with super heroes and villains. it could have been soo good but they all have such a chip on their shoulders for what has made this genre of tv and film that they  love  so popular in the first place. strong heroes and not sex obsessed addicts. they got so wrapped up in trying to paint themselves into these characters that they put a knife not only in its back but also in the heart of these heroes and their fans. Im truly worried how marvel will decide to regurgitate the fantastic four.
I long for the days when marvel made entertaining movies and the only things we criticized was the villains were underdeveloped or there was a bit too much humor etc. now marvel punches down at their audience for not liking what they put out and have these narcissists running the show.
they didn t  predict  it... they incited it... Ive seen this a lot. to make an analogy  it would be like finding a beautiful flower  then stomping on it repeatedly  and then finally pointing at it and criticizing it for being broken and ugly.I propose thatshe knew from day 1 how she wanted to attack the fan-sector she was after  and how it would affect them  so  she set out to do just that  and then touted herself as a prophet for  predicting  the obvious result of her attacks.
I love the spins that keep coming out. it keeps changing at breakneck speed. every day its a new spin to contradict the last one. its honestly more entertaining than the show itself.
everybody  we re going to make an absolutely killer final show! later   um  boss  the ratings are in. the final episode sucked.  okay  we re going to tell everybody we deliberately make a sucky final episode to own the trolls!
honestly this all feels like a  oh no the show was really bad. wait a minute. what if we play it off that we did this all on purpose
let s come together and write our own she-hulk series since they look at this character as a joke
Ive gone from being a welcomed fan to an unwanted villain. got it.
if they made it bad on purpose then they did an amazing job. its actually astounding how disasterfully bad they made it.
not many messages from three years ago prove that this was actually planned and not just a way of excusing the terrible writing and plots without actually admitting that they are not good writers!
- we owned the trolls! - their channels have experienced nothing but growth thanks to you. - but we owned them! our show is amazing! - when do you start filming season 2  then  - season whatnow
remember jurassic park  titanic  the dark knight movies that youremember and stand the test of time. no one will remember this show
I really like that they thought it was a good idea to put together a  show  that insults both the original ip and the fanbase  at a time when disney stock is dropping. that will make the shareholders ecstatic  Im sure.
this whole scenario reminds me a line from kung pow.  we have purposely trained him wrong as a joke
writing a bad show on purpose and predicting a negative reaction was so genius of them lmao
wtf is birthing person  is this abomination of a phrase really a thing
that was funny! very on it    birthing person     she has witty cool posts.
no money   no food drink   ded
who would ve know that a show about superhero that rolls her eyes every time she has to save someone and a lawyer who have no idea how the us legal system works would tank
@melonwatermelon  yeah didn t they say they realized in the writing room none of them knew how to write a courtroom drama  peak dunning-kruger.
you just described the daredevil show. daredevil did everything this show wanted to do but better. heck daredevil even had a scene of men catcalling women at night in new york that was way more realistic and impactful than in the she hulk show
yeah but the xmen are the ones that worry me the most
the writers admitted they couldn t write the legal focus she-hulk show they wanted to write so instead they wrote this.
none of them have the talent to pull off a law and order tipe show. so they made a show that was on their level. a dumpster fire with the marvel logo slapped on it with millions of dollars in it and excrement sitting on top  of it rolling down the street.
@josu  patI o  l seem to remember you cant call them x men any more  not inclusive enough  they are getting a re brand  smh.
who cares she-hulk always sucked as a character anyways.
@sad child  how can catcalling even be  impactful
@facundo montivero  because feelings over reality   it made some women  feel  away and as we all know any minor discomfort to a women especially in the first world most comfy life ever in this greater scheme of a world is the worst thing ever in the world. an impactful reminder how hard the women have it and how bad them mens are ohh woe is women.
thats because you guys complained about everything now they re giving you something to complain about congratulations
if marvel had stayed marvel instead of selling out to sony and disney  we might not have this problem. but there you go.
@red ninja  I didn t complain as much as some people did about small things in marvel. do I think some of their movies were weak  yeah but now they are getting people to turn against each other in the fanbase by inserting woke socio-political ideas overtones into their films. honestly a brilliant move on their part to deflect criticism but in time it ll be their downfall cause people will stop going.
@rodiusmaximus  im not sure about that cause the first couple of movies under disney were good even great. you gotta remember the doctrine for woke has infested every movie studio. if they stayed at paramount or their own studio w  a distributor giving no mandates they would bow before the mob
its gotten to the point thatshe hulk made me appreciate the netflix ironfist and lukecage more.
Ive always found the mcu to be outright terrible  I honestly think people praising this garbage for 10   years is how we got here  people applauded mediocrity and consumed to a point that they could use your own dollars to mock you and spit in your face while a vocal few ask for more
@red ninja  and what about the people who didn t complain
yup  thats exactly what it is.
like thats such a huge disrespect to the character and a huge waste of time!
chicks do this alot.in real life  Ive several times called women out on things they do or say..often try cover themselves  rather than admit doing wrong . it was a joke is another common way of avoiding accountability.
after spinning it as the best thing from marvel ever. they re getting caught in their own lies.
@fatgoat  thats unfortunate that you ve experienced multiple women like this in your life!    hopefully  you ll find someone who also takes accountability for their own actions!
@fatgoat  oh geez    Im sorry I didn t  mean to offend  I was trying to provide a sense of comfort! people like that  who try to make excuses for their toxic behavior  aren t the best of people! of course  only until they realize how they really are and not how they themeselves interpret to be and if they choose  to change!
thats exactly what it is. jennifer tells the writers she  didn t like the story.  mannn they are trying to escape the bad writing.
@  stargirl    you didn t offend me at all.I understood your angle  was just saying...Im not emotional about it  dont need support  but it was  comforting  to see a human reach out to another human stranger  that is nice  thank you.I do the same often for ppl in life  and online...at work..its a basic human thing that I enjoy.Im no at all offended by you cosmic lady.
@fatgoat   of course! its been a pleasure!
nah.. let itstay in the coffin. lets create something new....
disney would never allow it. marvel and star wars is lost forever. we just need something new.
it d be really cool if there was a fan made she-hulk series!
there s literally a better she hulk production on youtube from like 2008 with absolutely no budget called shamelessly she hulk. its the lowest budget thing ever and is infinitely better than this show. and I didn t make up that its better either  its rated a 6.5 on imdb  and the disney  show is a 5.9 right now  and sinking .
@marvin powell  ooo! thanks for the info! I ll definitely give it a watch!
this is what we need in entertainment...independent films!  hollywood is the problem  not the medium.  we just need creators to realise they dont need hollywood to make their ideas.
since when has she-hulk not been a joke
@  stargirl    Im extremely open and honest and like to explain in detail...this does often confuse ppl..most ppl are alot more emotional than me  so often assume  or project feelings into what Im saying.I see myself as more a computer than emotional person...add up the facts  do the math...find the truth and a solution.but again  thanks for trying anyways to comfort me somehow.but I assure you  Im happy and comfortable and get my fair share of both female and male attention..
@  stargirl    good day to you
@fatgoat  oh okieee loll!last part got me! thats alright  Im like a computer too loll  but Im also still emotional and yess youre very welcomee for providing a sense of comfort! and I wish you an endless eternity of happiness!
@fatgoat libs do this all the time.hating people badhating people who hate people good
genius!
@  stargirl    hope things go well for you too...maybe we will confuse each other one other day if we meet again .I dont have anything creative right now  so I ll leave you with a simple.take care  and all the best to you.
@anthony  yes  they are narrow minded children  sad and frustrating all at once.
well said. I dont believe for a second they actually tried to make she hulk this bad on purpose.
yeah  not to mention they clearly dont know what trolling is. you dont write a garbage show and then suddenly come out and say  oh btw guys  we just trolled you . thats not how trolling works.
@happy  han solo voice  thats not how it works.
I only remember it when disparu or thorias drops another vid. they re funny guys and entertaining.
they will  just not for the reasons the creators intended
there s good marvel content that I ll enjoy for the rest of my life...and most of it was before end game.
just like todays music. it wont ever be remembered. but the stuff from the 50s-90s will always be replayed
critics   this show is obviously a self-insert by the writer or writers shills   you only say that because you hate women jessica   I self inserted  so I could own the trolls who accused the show of being a self-insert show shills   shunning and brave I hate modern media.
they could have done this in a portion of an episode  having a set time for just dealing with the internet trolls and even talking about the fairness of criticism. it would have been easy and very interesting to do so. but instead  they make the whole show about it and beat a strawman to death over and over and over and over again. very sad  just like the writers must be irl
they can keep pretending like they re proud of this and feel accomplished  but we all know they re still drowning their sorrows with wine every night. this isn t how you overcome your weaknesses and insecurities  they re still just as miserable and salty as they ve always been and acting that way is a tell.
Ive never watched the show but I get what it is because of all the criticism lol
oh no! I feel so duped. outsmarted by such clever writing. darn!
if it was made only to get under peoples skin it really makes you ask questions about what the heck the higher ups are thinking  assuming they knew anything about this in the first place.also if they didnt know anything about this and they first time they hear about it is when the stock price drops after hearing that they aloud a show to be made only as a troll its fanbase aka they people paying their wages you have to imagine that the writers and showrunners will have a similar career path to ryan johnson and d d  oddly all 3 of them have only worked on 3 things since they messed up big
thats a pretty expensive troll if that were true  but I know they are just saying that to save face which brings them from being super petty to super pathetic.
doctor   Im going to kill the patient on purpose  ok  trust me  bro hospital ceo   yeah whatever... here s your check
made it bad on purpose...sure. the villian of the show is all the content creators I watch. makes sense. how about make good shows  like melonie  instead of wasting time and money. but it has helped a lot of content creators numbers go up. until next time
one of the other youtubers I follow is overLord dvd. with that mask  they were clearly targeting him too. keep up the good work melonie. is it wrong that Im hoping they include you in next seasons hate list  you must be getting on their radar lately oh  and whenever you do a video with your hair up I cant help but be impressed by your shoulders.
Ive gone from being a welcomed fan to their greatest villain. got it.
both these shows alone has helped recently a lot of small yt creators explode in subs and views  like call me chato  an ex-exec producer. his last video about the she-hulk variety article was really good and hilarious  and also just some guy latest videos on both sh rop are gold. I highly recommend anyone checking them out.
the first step in their plan was creating a show that would be hated by as many people as possible  which only amplifies the credibility of all the criticism the show received.
I really like your post melonie   very insightful and right on. thanks   I think mcu really slipped and went down hill  and its a shame. I do really enjoy your thoughtful and witty discussions.
I once told my mom the same about my grades ages ago... she didn t believe me either
our side is creating such great stuff right now  with barely any budget our creators make better quality entertainment
she hulk   strangles a puppy audience  dont strangle puppies!writers  you played right into our hands!audience  huh
I thought they said the show was for the audience marvel wasn t paying attention to before  women in particular.are they saying that women enjoy bad shows  sounds kind of nasty towards the people thatsay they enjoyed the show.
the fact that Ive never really taken the time to know the names of any writers of any show up until jessica gao says something. if she wanted her name to be associated with trash  mission accomplished.  I ll put her next to the film maker uwe boll.  maybe they can collaborate someday.
Im one of those people that discover all the youtubers you mentioned with she hulk and the rings of power. there was so much to criticise that a lot of content was created in a short period of time. for that Im afraid that this hype will fall flat like a failed souffl
they are lying anyhow. otherwise they would and said this before it aired not after it finished.
@anger macfadden  facts.
same here.
will there be a next season
fyI about doomcock. his main channel is pretty much complete bs. look up knights of melvin debunking him. and his spat with ryan kinnel. with thatsaid  I like doomcock s opinions and his conversationss when he s on podcasts and stuff. but his main channel is just pretty much just him making up wish fulfillment nonsense
@biggiiful  Imostly watch the friday night frolics. too many wrong predictions on the other stuff  but that one is entertaining.
next season   yeah ...  nah.
I think they thought they were making something good  they re just horrible at their jobs and are using this as an excuse.  oh shit  they dont like it  yeah  we did that on purpose.
I love how they spent all this money to own themselves   great job dI ney.  I lost just about all respect for tatiana maslany  especially after calling gao a  genius  wtf !    and I thought her performance in orphan black was one of the best I have seen on tv as numerous clones with distinct personalities. she did a good job of playing a self-insert of a see you next tuesday in gao.
just watched black adam. it is possible to make a good movie. dope story  nice twist  family story line. didn t overkill with the jokes  I actually laughed out loud at one of the jokes. the cameo at the end is epic I dont even care that it leaked. itstill cheered seeing it. they got black adam right. with thatsaid  the mcu is purposely being derailed. they re clearly ruining it on purpose.
I found your channel from the rop....whatever it was. I have grown to appreciate the way you think about things and your perspective on what has been happening to the media. I told my wife thatshe would prolly be good friends with you if you knew each other  d  d regarding she hulk. if this is really true and not some sort of attempt at salvaging a little bit of pride then its really sad. I strongly suspect though that these writers have shot themselves in the foot with this one. you know that no owner would sign off on a spite project quite so large  so that means that it must have been sold to them as a true product pitch. the chances of these folks getting to do another project without heavy oversight is probably non-existent or more likely  career suicide entirely. also  I think they know thats2 is out the window for them.
I do enjoy your content. do you like westerns if so  have you seen lonesome dove  a miniseries made in the early eighties very well written and produced by suzanne de passe. a movie that was intended to star john wayne as call  james stewart as gus  and henry fonda as jake spoon  but the project collapsed when john ford advised wayne to reject the script.
I wasn t punched! it was I  who hit his hand with my nose!    someone with the same qI score of a she-hulk writer!
this is literally going to be velma soon
if only they d shown this level of imagination is the show itself.
thatsaddest part of this is the fact that they thing they  owned  anyone.  people are complaining because we know the stories are suffering because writers focus on preaching a message instead of focusing on good stories and characters.     so they admit they made a bad show because they were focused on preaching a message.......then start high fiving each other for a job will done.    honestly  it is embarrassing they just proved the critics write.      they had a chance to prove an all women team could make a good comic tv shows with 25 million an episode and they wasted it acting like children.
the worst part of this is no one is gonna take anyone who worked on this project seriously in the future if they had put the effort into making a good show rather than preemptively complain about people not liking their bad show then this show could have greatly helped them
these people are geniuses. they are able to predict that they ll get a negative reaction when they poop everywhere  amazing! someone give them a nobel prize.
I cant wait until the next season of she-hulk where she meets billy butcher  the cameos are gonna be awesome.  we may need more superheros after  though.
well written hell I would of accepted competently written and mildly entertaining
so basically  we spent millions to write bad fan fic to troll mean boys  thats spectacular. it has all the depth and drama of middle school.
the  writers  room  for their show about a lawyer was open for three years and nobody noticed or seemed concerned that no one they hired knew anything about lawyers  dont you think that might be a problem
lmao gao really thinks  the trolls  played into their hands  nah she just proved that we re living rent-free in their heads she really did tank a beloved character to spite real fans. how pathetic is that
I have to admit that Ive been watching your videos for the last two weeks cause I happened to stumble upon you accidentally and I found your video is very interesting and stuff but I tend to agree with you a lot of the stuff concerning she hold and all thatstuff they didn t follow the ip the right way  or they should have because they had comics that they could ve gone by and drawn from directly.
if they had written a good story  and actually made the real she hulk  people would have lived it. she hulk was a fantastic comic  and well loved.
an expensive social experience then putting the stars and the cast at risk of not getting anymore jobs - since that is a thing. well done at trolling for your own selfish intention and the fans that made this show possible in the first place. or did you forget  no fans   no new development or disney plus shows
this interview actually shows that the youtubers  critics and former fans were correct.
when you feel you have done something special but its the same old woke  fake  hate crap. all these folks offer is hate. this hate eats you from the inside out and when itstarts to show on the outside it can and will get really ugly.
I love she hulk. everything about her is perfectly written... disney made a green troll series and called itshe hulk....can I sue disney for misleading information about the main protagonists
their aim was to make a crap tv show and  to be fair to them  they succeeded. they should be really proud of the fact they achieved their goal. they created something that absolutely nobody likes  except simon peg and a few lonely cat ladies  but they were probably just impressed with the bright colours and ps2 quality visuals.
do they realize they said to their employers   we literally blew millions of your dollars for a joke  and they think disney and marvel would be okay with that
things like this are why audiences are quickly approaching total apathy toward anything disney marvel
great job that they didn t get renewed for a 2nd season
what else canthey say at this point   its the equivalent of falling in front of people and then say you meant to do that!
not gonna lie  I actually am grateful for she-hulk.  without she-hulk I wouldn t have found disparu and melonie.
I predicted that the show  especially the 1st episode  was made to trigger certain people from the 3rd or 4th episode on...and I think it was very funny. its been a very long time since a show or movie interacted  directly and indirectly  with the audience in this way  which makes sense for she-hulk due to  meta  being its main theme. I was one of those triggered people  but I can admit Ive been had  and laugh about it. it wasn t done with malicious intent but for fun
she-hulk is actually a good character. she had so much potential to be portrayed as the hero she is in the comics especially during the john byrne era. its a shame these scumbags hijacked the character like they did with others.
I ll  be honest  for ww gal was not my 1st choice and I am skeptical about it. in the end she did  a decent ww but  I just figured I d like to see the female version of a spartan from 300 being wonder woman. she didn t have to be that jacked though but just visibly believable to be doing what she would be doing.I dont think it was an unfair expectation either  you dont see scrawny male heroes doing martial feats or strength feats. the other way is they could have played off ww to not be strong af but quick footed. but they didn t do that  they had her chop off a part of doomsday which was on par with zeus since a version of dd and wolf in dceu had fought in canon of screen which came to a draw.we saw how ww got bodied by wolf in the later movie but still  eh  she isn t a bad ww.someone like gina carano would have fit more I think. she d have had to cut maybe 15lbs and get lean but she already has the body type for a life action ww.
she s the kid who fell on their face and got up all muddy saying  Imeant to do that to troll clean people  even if its true which I doubt  still not a good look.
imagine writing a battle scene where halfway through the soldiers randomly have bendy rubber swords then saying   haha! I knew people would  troll  us for thatso we did it anyway to troll people for trolling us! gotcha!   thats my analogy..
jessica gao   I want to troll the trolls by making the next marvel show the worst thing they ve ever seen. disney   thatsounds intriguing.  what s it going to cost us  jessica gao   at least  75-million...and a huge portion of marvel s fan base. disney   we re in.
how sad. gao can act as clever and in control as she wants but a few short years from now when wokeness in tv and movies has died and she s sitting at home with no man  no partner and just her dog  she may have to ask herself if any of what she did really made her life better in the end.
what amazes me is that they say that they predicted the comments that they would get only to completely get everything wrong. literally nobody was saying anything even close to that about she-hulk of all characters  one of the most beloved iconic female characters in comics. this is why you dont hire people who dont know jack  about the thing they re writing to write an adaptation of all things
cool. this makes me even more happy I haven t wasted any of my time on this show
Imiss the tv and shows made prior to 2017
I d support a reboot for a she-hulk done well  I cant imagine how they d get her work work in future films shows because of this show
this whole  we made it bad on purpose  crap reminds me of when someone trips and falls and then tries to pass it off as if they meant to do it...
the entire purpose of the show were the writers telling us they are incompetent and then proved it by writing this show. the worst part are that people will say  you hate women  even though you ve given them a reason why the show is not good.
they would. its disney and marvel after all. until dc manages to pull out a blockbuster and start rolling in money with their new anti-woke aproach disney and marvel will stick to the woke product.
yes  exactly. I d guess that jessica gao wasn t even aware thatshe hulk was so popular  previously. must not have been included on she hulk s fandom wikI page  lol.
me to
I bet if they actually had stuck to the comics then this show  would have a whole different rating. I love the original she hulk comics!
thing is there are people that grew up on she-hulk as a character. she is a legacy character  and has been a key member of the avengers for most of its existence. the writers pretty much stuck a middle finger to those people.
yes a new video. go boom!
gotta love how they use the terms  trigger  and  trolls  without knowing what they mean.  to trigger someone is to make them lose control of their emotions.  to troll someone is to do something specifically to annoy or offend others.  rational criticism or even sincere mockery of a film is not being triggered or trolling  but at least we have their admission of doing the latter.
so it worked as intended.everyone at least do not love it.I wanted to see matthew  honestly!but if the series was good for me  I d watch it!I gave peacemaker an opportunity and it didn t let me down!
Ive read each ep of this atrocity was  25mil which adds up to a total of  225. gao used  225mil to vicariously live her fantasies and then talks about the entitlement of fans er  Imean  trolls.
its sad when I d rather watch the reviews than the actual shows
damn I had high hopes for she hulk smfh cant believe they blew it with this bs and spent all that money.
no this show wasnt  bad on purpose . these writers are so aweful  they try to pretend it was  on purpose .
no we re not comic failures  we were just trolling bro!
she-hulk is what happens when failing upward becomes a viable career path.
she-hulk was not bad at all ! it was a proper adaptation of what this character is all about and it also poked fun at the current state of marvel fandom and  fatigue. I think it was brilliant and fresh. its a legal comedy  like ally mcbeal  that pokes fun at current social dynamics. I believe that marvel succeeded in what was attempted here. the whole theme of the show and the finale anticipated the reaction of the culture in a sort of genius meta commentary thats totally in line with what she-hulk should be in this day and age. we have to let marvel be weird and have fun with different tones like they re doing so well these days.  the writing at marvel is as its ever been   a little campy  casual and convenient  but fun and with cool worldbuilding. they are delivering better  more bold and risky  creative productions.  thatsaid  the special effects are sometimes a little undercooked I ll admit that. I personally salute the bold stylistic choices they made with wandavision  ms marvel  moon knight  strange  and she-hulk. I feel like some of the fans are just fatigued and or spoiled at this point  making them ungrateful and entitled. its ok if you dont get the meta and the weird and are there mainly for the classic super hero recipe. its ok to find things bad  I just dont agree. for me  the hero punching the villain is often the least interesting part of a marvel film.
long story short  the show is good  you just hate women  here s a list of cool lady characters and why they re popular  ...you just dont like doing anything different   but youre not doing anything period  ...its empty and devoid of anything on purpose!!! dont you get it     collective facepalm with background laughter
something goes wrong   oh  we did it for the fun of it   oh we just wanted to prove a point   oh we wanted to trigger people .I did this as a kid  bet a lot of people do. its just an excuse for failure.and yes  Imet you  the critical drinker  and saw some videos of folks I wasn t following for a good while because of she-who.
well this exposes all the shill reviewers that claimed it was a good show then doesnt it  she just threw all of them under the bus.
gao   we made a terrible show on purposenormal people   great  we ll cancel  never subscribe to  disney
they did their jobs to well. they made this show so bad on purpose they turned the hero into the villain and the real life inspiration for thr villains into the heros.
there s no way they were trying to make it bad.  its so bad because we know they had genuine passion for such trash.
rule 1 of superheroes.   just be badass.   its not that hard.  we will put up with social commentary  if youre just badass.we will put up with funky special effects.just be badass.we will put up with shaky writing.just be badass.we will overlook plotholes.just be badass.we will love youregardless of race  creed  sexual orientation  nationality.just be badass.badasses dont whine about their situations they fix thembadasses dont lament the societal patriarchal structures. they set the example to fix them.when will these idiots figure this out.
jessica gao  Im so happy to be on a marvel project  but they wouldn t let me  an asian woman  write shang chI so Im going to make she-hulk into a show that attacks fans and attacks marvel itself.  other karens  youre a genius!
they did dirty all the people that have brains   not just the fans of the character.
not first
wow  these chicks are rightfully patting themselves on the back for predicting what would happen if you take an established franchise and give it a generic woke rewash after its only happened 237 other times in the last 5 years. brilliant
its kind of funny how she goes from the first episode talking about how she gets cat calls  and all this crap on the streets and how she s like a victim and stuff  to actually twerking with megan thee stallion and another episode. its a complete contradiction!
when I can predict the likely criticism for my work  I usually change the work to make my clients happy and maintain a good working relationship. they took a bold alternative route... let s see how that goes for them  d
we made this show bad on purpose  I wonder how they gonna explain that to investors
literally just binged this show today because I have been getting tons of suggestions for videos about the show  including this one. there s been so much discourse about the show that I just had to see it for myself. I can definitely say that it doesnt surprise me that they were trolling with this show  but thats actually really disappointing because I found jen to be an actually interesting character  and seeing a  super-powered  individual navigating her otherwise normal-ish life was actually a really fun premise for a show. the show had potential  and I lowkey enjoyed most of the episodes  so Im pretty sad they basically just made the show to troll the  haters  instead of making something that could stand on its own. if nothing else  tatiana maslany  as well as some of the other cast members  gave me enjoyable performances and more genuine laughs than I should probably admit lol
Im really enjoying the new she hulk comic run it got me through the show
I love that you avoid cussing. thank you for setting standards  girl. I also appreciate your pro-Christian tweets  you are a breath of fresh air!
they remind me of the kid who couldn t read in middle school so when the teacher told him to read  he made it funny so people think its just a joke. it has gone to shit and their idea of damage control is telling people they made it bad on purpose. actually  it was their very best.
Ive had people in the same discussion tell me  after I pointed out the show was completely misandrist   that the show isn t misandrist   is flipping the script on misogynist shows of which they claim there are countless contemporary examples  but when asked to name one they clam up . thats the kind of person this show appealed to. people who dont understand that if you are  flipping the script on misogyny  then what you are doing is being misandrist.
they could just said the show was a parody of a marvel show instead of a  law sitcom and I d believe that.
I ll just say this about she-hulk and the crews crippling insecurities. nothing screams  I depserately care what you think about me!  louder than loudly proclaiming  I dont care what you think about me! .
so either they backpedalled with a lame comeback trying to say  we meant to troll the fans  or disney mcu really has money to waste they wanted to troll the fans just because    she hulk is literally mcus batwoman. and nice hair do I like the hair up looks good
spending millions upon millions just to spite  neckbeard loser critics  seems very petty and juvenile
I have to wonder if at any point someone in the echo chamber of a writer s room this show had asked  should we worry that we are trolling everyone who pays for d  as much as the trolls we are directing it at    naw.. they lack thatself-awareness.
many of their critics already had a hunch that it was all done out of spite early on and they just confirmed the hunches to have been accurate as far as gut feelings go. the writing staff s  prediction  is as impressive as a child intentionally getting every answer wrong on a test then patting themselves on the back when they receive an  f  grade for their effort.
we all show up for milla jovivich  angelina jolie  and michelle yeoh action films.
she-hulk creators   we shot ourselves in the face  and massively flipped off everyone paying for disney  just to trigger our critics by proving them right about us.she-hulk critics   well done  you sure showed us.
amazing to think that disney spent millions of dollars to purposely make a show they knew was bad and attacked the very fans that loved the original she-hulk comics. its probably the most insane thing I can imagine a media company could do... so who did they make it for then... I guess just themselves
they are a bunch of sickos
if in the show doomcock finally takes over the world then I ll actually watch it that would be lit.
so you have fallen for the trap. I havent watched and will not watch it even out of curiosity cuz thatstill makes them money. not watch it is the best way
@                I didn t watch it through their streaming service  so they got absolutely nothing from me. the beauty of the internet is that I dont need disney  to watch disney  content lol
especially when thats what they think they re doing but isn t. all they really did was spend millions to give a middle finger to men in general  and call everyone a troll
imagine me explaining my excitement for this show to my gf when it was originally announced  only to have my gf then look at me like Im a damn idiot as this show gets worse by the week.
how did they predict those  troll comments  exactly because all the comments Ive seen about the show online are very different from what they show inside the show.I have seen not a single person complaining about there being too many female superheroes to give just one example. also the people online didn t blame the actors  but solely the writers  well... until a certain actress brought the hate down on herself with stupid twitter comments anyway  but I consider this a reaction to her twitter  not the show itself   so again wrong prediction.the only thing they could predict was that the show would be hated by the majority of the audience that usually watches marvel stuff and that prediction is something any 5-year old could have made. and now they are padding themselves on the back for a grade-school understanding of cause and effect. wow...but then again their writing skills and understanding of the law and court issues seems to be on the level of a grade-schooler too  so I guess that is consistent at least. any criticism you can lob at them  they have thought of.  really  then why is their universal answeer  you are racist and or homophobic and or misoginistic  even when confronted with criticism over their understanding of the law  even hate watching is attention ... so in other she s screaming at the top of her lungs for any attention  since she either is incapable of or too lazy to garner attention with a good product. so in other words  once again childish behaviour. she s just a toddler screaming  pay attention to me! a question that I wish one of the journalists would ask the writers and director is  do you think you ll ever get another job as a writer director again   because I bet they didn t consider how much they are sabotaging their own career for some twitter points. if the series they produce is a huge financial failure  which mocking their own audience is a near enough guarantee for  who would be willing to hire them  no matter how woke a company presents themselves to be  at the end of the day they need to make money or they ll go bankrupt. working against your own audience is something they might be able to indulge in for some time  but once their money dries up its change or sink and that means the woke writers will inevitably lose their jobs one way or the other.I love the irony of how their own self-sabotage is helping the very people they think they are trolling.
as a supervisor in charge of a budget  I cannot wrap my head around someone intentionally making a product to fail  just to tweak the noses of some people on the internet. Imean  they re hurting themselves by intentionally making a product that will not make any money. thats insane.
our show sucks and everybody hates it. we should just tell them that we wasted millions of dollars and months of our time to troll the trolls!
oh no  a man! they re so evil  horrible  and entitled. I wonder what kevin thinks of this since he s their boss and a white male! give that a thought
they re going through the 5 stages of cope  denial  anger  bargaining  we are here   depression  acceptance.
its like saying you dont bathe so people you hate will say you smell bad. the joke was on them!
youre right. I started watching you after seeing you on drinker s channel where she-hulk was one of the topics
I need to try this when Im at my work and get a bad review.  yeah Im shit at my job  but Ive been doing it to troll you  and this review of my performance is engagement  which Ive been aiming to get from the start
in the end  the viewers owned the she hulk creators who spent the studio s money and did not provide a return on investment. like they forgot who pays them  not the studio  but the viewers.
at this point  I cant understand why people are surprised about this. they insult the fan base  make a shitty product that nobody likes  and then they walk away saying its not their fault.edit  if I opened up a steakhouse in a community thats 99  vegan  it wont be the community s fault for my failure.
I wonder... if people just decided not to watch the show at all  would they have clung to the narrative that the show wasn t for everyone like they were saying while they were releasing episodes  Im firmly in the camp that they tried to create some bs fanfiction  and people didn t like it  so they lashed out saying  its not for you.  then when people picked apart the show pointing out all of its mistakes and flaws  they re now turning around and saying   we got you  we made it bad on purpose to screw with you!  um  Im pretty sure they didn t and they re just trying to salvage what s left of their reputation so they might be able to continue having a career after this  assuming someone believes what they re saying now as opposed to what they were saying only a few weeks ago.
I wonder if the disney executives who paid for their joke will be laughing and green light a second season or allow these writers to work on another show.
the sad part is I could see tatiana as a young ellen ripley if they wanted another alien movie.
no the villain of this show where actually the writers if they believe in what they said in the interview
she-hulk serves as a vessel for the writer of either how she perceives the world  or how she perceives her world is perceived through the hollywood lens  aka a parody of its perception. the biggest problem is that neither one is very interesting for anyone who isn t the writer or either find some form a humour in a very superficial reflection of the world. its the creator that chuckles at the genius of their own navel gazing and then backtracks and says its a self-fulfilled prophecy of bad writing and social commentary  simply because that in itself is more amusing  rather than laugh at the funny perceptions of what is real or her writing talent. whatever the truth is  it is what it is  a poorly written and unfunny show  that is targeted for those very same reasons.
whatever happened to  with great power comes great responsibility . in my opinion a superhero isn t just someone who stops the bad guys. a superhero is someone who chooses to risk their life to save everyone  regardless of whether the people deserve it or not. like aunt may said  sometimes  in order to do what s right  we have to be steady and give up the things we want the most. even our dreams. what does she-hulk sacrifice  not much. she does everything in a way that benefits herself more than others. would she risk her life for one of those intelligencia men  I doubt it. I guess she s the judge of who deserves to be protected and who doesnt.  stomping up to k.e.v.i.n. and demanding that he change her ending was like the opposite of what a hero  role model should do. she s like the anti-spiderman in thatshow.
I wonder what its called  aside from hilarious  when we live rent free in their heads  but it costs them millions to troll us.
so clever...they accomplished exactly what they wanted..1 season and thats it..kind of makes you wonder if the alonzo crew realizes they dont have a choir to preach to..
those villain masks and doomcock mask are almost identical. he is one of the  targets .
too bad she is now brainwashed by woke mouse and is attacking fan now
@melonwatermelon  agreed. I think they ruin more careers than they make  however black adam was really good!
the thing that bothers me is not the show being trash cuz I just dont watch it. its the fact there are people out there who like it. now this is scary.
1st thing they did was changing the origin story from bruce saving jen with a blood transfusion  to jen saving bruce in a car wreck.. we were able to predict the trolling bc its not trolling and its the same complaints of all these bad shows  they dont learn.
melonie is so pretty and she can see through all the bullshit
so about all those stans that have been lauding the show this whole time....
Ive got a great idea here for the showrunners of future marvel tv shows. hear me out  how about we make a show based on a popular comic book character that we love because we re fans for the fans of that comic  crazy  right  but  it just might work!
I thought producers in hollywood gave money to directors to make box office successes and get a profit. to learn that  poking fun at youtubers  was another viable investment objective! go figure
I wont lie  I tolerated the first ep and never went back. I can only hope daredevil was used well!
person trying something stupid which she would know how stupid it was if she had any grasp on what she was supposed to do and faceplants  I totally meant to do that  got ya  for expecting me to faceplant and break my nose..... and chipping two front teeth.... and loosing my job.... probably my career even. you go mrs gao ! really  got us there !
imagine  in what other job you go and do things bad on purpose and still got paid  outrageous
they point in that gotcha at the end like it was really cool to call out the  trolls  but in reality if they d just made a good show then there wouldn t of been any criticism oh Imean trolls.
I subscribed to you and everyone else mentioned because of she hulk and rings of power.
hahaha thats a good point that the show has helped boost people s social media accounts more.soon youtube critics will be getting more views than the actual shows they review
I would kill to hear what the business side debriefing sounds like -yep  we re struggling for viewers  flops and major decline in interest across our ips and here s a new strategy  directly attack remaining viewers. truly I dont understand why heads aren t rolling.  metaphorically speaking
this is just the mcu version of   Imeant do that!
the difference between tragedy and comedy. tragedy is when bad things happen to good people. comedy is when bad things happen to bad people. she hulk is a perfect example of comedy.
they did the same thing with the little mermaid. its about triggering people creating controversy and division. its not about making something the fans love anymore.
living up to the expectations of the trolls is not owning the trolls  its proving them correct.
if I paid someone to write a show and they said they deliberately made it bad I d be firing them immediately. so yeah  since this hasn t happened this is quite clearly an attempt at damage control
you could litterly  have gotten the same game with a few winks to the ideas in there and moving forward with a good show.
melonie great video the shenmue anime based on the videogames is on crunchy roll and came out this year its really good
nah. these writers dont have enough talent to make a show bad intentionally. this show was 100  meant to be revered and uplifted by the masses  and when these people realized nobody thinks of them the way they think of themselves they had a real  oh s     moment and went into spin mode.
when superficial narcissists fail  they always say it was on purpose  - their egos  cant handle failure.
I really hate how this is just how western media is now at these days. entertainment should be for entertainment  plain and simple. itshouldn t be a campaign to spread hate on the internet  itshould be a fun thing to bring people together. how the hell did we get to this point
the little troll that lives inside me  sounds like she needs help
I was so disappointed this was bad I was all set to she an awesome she-hulk story.I hate how these days the characters I enjoy watching as a kid get mistreated and used for some kind of agenda.I always love sitting down after I get back from being bullyed at school to see stan lee present the marvel action hour with the hulk  fantastic four  x-men and mr stan lee s favourite spider man on the fox kids channel.but its not just marvel characters the new velma show based on scooby-doo s velma with her as the main character or disney s little mermaid why are all characters getting altered to be all most completely different from the original or have do or be something they are not.
I just want to know if the people who invested money in show were aware of the purpose
next level iq. they got methey tricked me into not watching their show and doomed me to finding so many entertaining youtube channels that I now subscribed to.I got owned  well played marvel trickery department  not you loki
cool to see you and disparu shouting eachother out
thank you for watching and dunking on this  show  so I didn t have to.
we should sue them for story by credits since we  inspired  their content.
if this is true I feel many of the people behind creating much of this show should be fired   probably blacklisted in hollywood if their goal was to make something terrible to piss off people on purpose. if these types of people work for a small business   make something with that intent  that business would go under almost instantaneously.
according to logic  comic logic  and sitcom logic the last big bad  the bad guy  is the character that the main character defeats. in she-hulk that character is the writers and marvel studios. they act like its the random troll group. however  they admit they re the enemy of good quality product. the fact that they re oblivious makes sense. they said they think the first season of the sitcom is to only talk about the main character. that tells you all you need to know.
they were able to predict that the show they knew sucked was going to have people say itsucked watch out nostradamus!!!
Im sure the producers love the fact that they created something intentionally bad. they re lying anyways  thats just an excuse because the show is so poor that they have to pretend like they did that on purpose.
they basically said they made the show as a money laundering scheme
bad on purpose  oh. well then. good job. good job all around. you had a goal and ya met it. not sure why  but ya did. fantastic.
let me get this straight  this was the producers plan create show with xyz issuesknow that xyz issues existexpect valid criticisms of xyz issuesmake the people who critique xyz issues the villain and call them incelsact as if you are super smart because people commented on the issues in your show and call them idiots for it
so they lost money trying to make a show that trolled their critics...  wonder how disney s investors feel about this
im sure disney loved the epic trolling the creators did  spending all that money just to stick it to the people not interested in the show
yes she expects people to believe she intentionally created one of the worst shows in tv history with terrible ratings ruining her future career prospects just to  troll people
this has  syke  I had my fingers crossed  energy.
imagine taking out an episode from the middle of the season of any show because that episode is  not for them  ... if she hulk did not cover some of the characters from other movies and series or some important plot points  ie. sokovia accords  and was purely isolated series set in marvel universe - id not mind it being  not for me  and would never watch it  but then again no one would probably watch then and they would loose money.
I was actually excited about this show.  but  they were too involved in spreading  the message  to actually write a good show.  we just got sex in the city with a super hero.
a fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. the grapes seemed ready to burst with juice  and the fox s mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.the bunch hung from a high branch  and the fox had to jump for it. the first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. so he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it  only to fall short once more. again and again he tried  but in vain.now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. what a fool I am   he said.  here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for. and off he walked very  very scornfully.
hey melonie did you see black adam yet  and if so  what are your honest thoughts
ahhh the old  we were only pretending to be stupid  cope. classic.
Imust applaud these brave woke writers.  it takes guts to ruin your career in such a public and costly fashion.
if they had actually made a she-hulk show  they might have a point. but this wasn t she-hulk  this was bizzaro she-hulk with no relation to the actual she-hulk besides the name. the fact they used this as a means to cover over their abominable  pun intended  characters and plots is just another red herring to distract from the fact that this is no longer marvel at all - it just has marvel names and powers.post-script  I dont think they actually understand what trolling is. if we didn t mean what we were saying and were doing it to get a reaction  that would be trolling. but we re serious as a heart attack. coincidentally  thats precisely the effect this kind of thing will have on marvel - the lifeblood of money will no longer flow.
those poor writers  they actually think what they did was trolling.  trolling would have required them to first create something that had the semblance of being good before pulling the rug out from under us.  what they did is equivalent to watching your drunk uncle awkwardly hit on all the 19 year olds at a wedding  piss himself  pass out in a pool of his own vomit  and then waking up the next morning thinking he was such a stud.
they just suck at writing  I cant put as much responsibility on the actors  because they are acting out what writers write. but this was literally a vanity project where she could show an extremely biased sample of what her life is like. how the show is written is how she sees and interprets the world
we intentionally made this piece of garbage to be garbage  we weren t proud of our horrible writing at all! lmao cope
Im having trouble coming up with a non-first-wonderwoman female-led superhero show of the last 10 years where the writers  rather than trying to troll their own audience  set out to just make the best show that they could make. I wonder if thats why there s such a history of problematic female-led superhero shows. because it feels like every time an established good writer and director come in and make a show with a female lead  or strong female presence in the ensemble cast  its popular. alien 1-2. buffy. firefly. hanna. v for vendetta. heck  the hunger games.
sure it was. thats like saying  oh it was a joke  we meant to do that . nah  they thought they d write the wokest shit ever   thought we d eat thatshit up.
I see a lot of people here expressing doubt that the show is bad on purpose. I fully believe they made it bad on purpose for one reason  jen s fourth wall breaks. think about it. she claimed wong would give the show  twitter armor.  she predicted people would be annoyed by the wedding episode and made excuses for it. when her life fell apart  she asked the viewer  is this what you guys want   the evidence was there long before these interviews. they absolutely planned for the series to be poorly received.
obviosuly they re lying. you cant fake something you cant do. they are only using  trolling  as an excuse to justify their inexperience with making a series. you can only fake something when you know how to do it.
its funny thatshe-hulk climbed over black panther on the disney  web site.  a true acasemy award winner not to mention generating billions for marvel.
I shudder with horror and dread the day jessica gao and rian johnson meet and make something together.
if you listen closely  you might hear the sound of a car door slamming shut as my last bit of patience for marvel and hollywood peels down the road  never to be seen again.
what s funny to me is the very short fall thatshe-hulk had to be woke.  to me  characters that break the fourth wall that often never very good.  and the biggest problem with marvel women is most of them are either team members or derivatives of a male hero.  dc s women  ie wonder woman   black canary  are more individualistic and definitely not derivatives  although there are plenty in dc as well.
she-hulk to me is just a better version of deadpool in the comics.  the live action version isn t my favorite  but the story they put out there was good.  I dont know about the meaning behind all the stuff  but I ll be watching more of them if they make more.  just my thoughts though  peace and love y all
I would ve rather seen melanie here be cast as she hulk. beautiful and smart  and could ve told them all to screw off  do it how the fans want. I would ve watched that.
this reminds me of a little kid that trips over a curb and lands face first in the pavement then pops up and says  Imeant to do that
they thought they could do it but proven they couldn t so now they re trying to play it off as if they didn t even try and the show was some type of  troll or something. its like awkward girl trying to approach chad and got rejected but playing it off as if it was a joke.
you are awesome  back peddling much....these woke idiots are so hypocritical. its just bad writing and choices on their part. they need to own up to their shortcomings and be accountable for their actions.
this is what happens when schools hand out participant medal instead of telling kids they ain t special. we get a generation of people blaming others for their shitty personality or lack of skills.
so writers directors instead of making the series with passion and love and care for the comics the character and the  source material you instead deliberately went out of the way to make a show to basically  troll  people welp guess I know why disney is gonna go bankrupt
translation  we manipulated our way into a  space  we hate  so that we could do everything we could to destroy it  and those in it...
heh... yeah..... that was definitely a brilliant plan.  golf clap
how   and why   are we even surprised this is a thing   I said this a million times  I ll say it again   this is nothing new  these people aren t doing anything differently  they used to do it back then and they re still at it - they dont like fantasy and cant understand why we do - all they do is destroy every single thing we enjoy - they insert themselves all friendly into our circles  then they mock and belittle us - its is just a different way to harass us - they used to do it back in the day  and they re still doing this now - its called bullying. ...
you d think they would ve taken notes from the developers of the sonic film.
the pieces for this show were there. a legal comedy set in the mcu surrounding superhero court cases. that type of show is ripe for comedy. the problem is that they didn t write jen as a compelling character. they didn t flesh out any of the side characters. they didn t give us anything to bite into. the show was fluff. the pieces were there and it bums me out that instead they wrote a show with the intent of creating a toxic environment amongst fans. I love staying up late with friends and watching the new marvel shows  then talking about it afterwards. the concept of she hulk having to be a statement on female leads in superhero films feels a little behind. its hard to make that point in a post wonder woman captain marvel world. wandavision was a female led show  and it was great. I enjoyed ms. marvel. this show felt lazy. female led superhero content has evolved.
oh! in that case they did a great job
I love the epic burn about  opening up more jobs than the president  thank you for that
if their goal was to create a bad show  then job well done folks.
following canon is crucial in the superhero movie industry. that is the foundation  from their u cant go wrong.
interesting marketing strategy we ll get all those people who have devoted their lives to following comics and tell them that they re no longer necessary and then wonder why the industry is crumbling afterwards
she s saying that because its the only way to cover for their incompetence.
puts it out if you hate it  you hate women! gets a lot of hate it was on purpose lol
the people who were involved in she-hulk just need to quite because they are just digging themselves a deeper hole at this point.
ms gao should look up  pyrrhic victory . how s the next project looking  the next commission  what is the production team going to do next  once you go scorched earth on your dignity  reputation and fans  and the studio cancels the next season  where does that leave you  I doubt a back-up career in pr beckons.
I love how the show was so bad their trying to play it off like thats how itsuppose to be
thatshines a good light on birthing persons writers for sure
yeah  she showed them. boosting their views and add revenue. garnering them more likes than the actual show got  em!!
claiming you made it bad on purpose is just trying to make yourself look cool and act like youre in control. they thought they made a great thing  then when they saw the reviews  realized it wasn t food and backtracked
someone needs to teach them some classic common sense like the phrase cutting off your nose to spite your face and the fable of the man who killed the golden goose.
we made the show bad on purpose haha. wait  why aren t you watching our stuff  I think they ve forgotten they re in the entertainment industry  and not the  waste everyone s precious free time and money  industry. imagine going to a restaurant  getting served burnt food and then the chef coming out saying they did it on purpose while laughing at you and calling you a troll.
I think its funny she talks about her  position  in  the culture we re living in  . is she positioning herself as the villain
and yet there are people who proudly claim  this was a good show you just didn t watch it
imo  once they realized it was a trash fire  they used this  troll idea  as an excuse that it was deliberate. that way it was also a middle finger to people on the right.
that is what we do is to criticize movies and tv series. we have always done this with anything. they do the same damn thing  but get angry when their work gets criticized if it is not a good review. there should not be anything wrong with reviewing movies and tv. these woke creators are truly insane.
making a crappy show on purpose... a genius idea! Im going to shoot my own foot to make a point myself!
we love trolling the trolls  - wow  its a shame then that the trolls dont watch your swill  so the only people you trolled were fans and average viewers...epic winzorz!
when all else fails  remember   you failed on purpose
all she hulk taught me is the writers are so thinned skinned its transparent. the trolls won and they re just coping at record highs.
I really like she- hulk in the comics. I liked her run as part of fantastic four. I was so looking forward to this show. too bad the writing is so bad.
we wrote a sh!tty show because we knew they were going to say it was a sh!tty show.  see we showed them
there is so much resistance to a woman just existing in a space of superheroes the same space that made she hulk popular enough to even have a disney plus show !  smh
wow  on earth would I want to describe to streaming services for making horrific content
what I took away from this show is that jessica gao is so lonely and unhappy and hates men and finds everyone else superficial. the sheer amount of depressing self insert from the writers is just kind of sad.
Im sure they wanted to waste all that money just to  trigger trolls    whoever financed the project knowing this must be a financial genius!!!
isn t this sort of like when the joker lit all that money on fire
what a stupid world we live in. let s write a show with the expressed purpose of making fun of and being mean to the audience we re writing for. as a life long comic book fan I barely pay attention to the death throws of something I once was a huge fan of. r.i.p. stan lee 1922-2018
the current state of films and tv series.  we make films for the sole purpose of being petty pieces of shit with people who disagree with us .
they chose to do a she-hulk show because it has been a successful comic book series in the world of comics shops  which is hugely male dominated. they used thatsuccess as a spring board insulting the marvel customers from the past. they didn t choose another character which had been less able to stand on her own like kitty pride or dazzler. then they are upset that the customer base rejects the product they aired. then they claim they intended to upset everyone all along. pretty convoluted logic when you think about it.
seems like a good business decision. rings of power is the same thing.
so     they intentionally wasted hundreds of millions of dollars   I am sure that disney was laughing about that  .
if they could ve made something good then they them would ve. they them planned on taking a deuce on fans from day 1.fans  meanwhile  waited to see the trailer before giving it every bit of vitriol it deserved.I look forward to seeing them at the unemployment office.
thats the excuse that they came up with to justify the crappy show that they made unbelievable  so they came up with a show to give a big f u to the critics  if I was there boss I ll be pissed off . all that money that got wasted and I definitely wont have them back
dear melonie do you think they ve figured out that if she-hulk is certified as  canon  they ll compromise every future marvel superhero project   from now on  every time there s an element of danger or sacrifice  the audience will expect the central figure to bitchslap the writers to create a happy ending.frank.
when they say they  predicted  troll comments  3 years ago   they mean they cherry picked a handful of women-hating posts. note how none of these troll quotes on the show say anything about female comments  gay lesbian comments  or comments about the writing  the plot  the cgI  etc. they live in a bubble world and interpret all criticism as misogynistic. like jen in the show  they do not regret or learn from their mistakes.
that article is 3 and a half weeks old.but yes the show was sorry.
if marvel cant see thatshe-hulks portrayal of feige as k.e.v.i.n ist a good look at all then I honestly dont know what to say.
dont forget doomcock.
either fiegie has become woke himself..or he s trap with bunch of woke crew  writter  and staff and than afraid to fired they who underperform.. kinda feel bad for him
kevin feige didn t greenlight that aI scene  some people Imean someone above him did.  that was dehumanizing
wonder woman was great!!! one of my fav superhero movies
saw you from an older video that may have hit algorithm jackpot or something.just wanted to say earned likes for what you say  earned sub for when you include Bible verses!love to see it!
heck you!!  nice one melonie!
she was handed a great ip that fans loved and she still turned it into garbage
was anyone disappointed in the season finale of she-hulk simply because they were expe ting the hulk king to dr samuel sterns from the incredible hulk movie from 2008  ever since episode 3 when the wrecking crew attempted to mug jennifer for a sample of her blood and especially since the reveal of intelligencia gearing up for another attempt in episode 6 the buildup for identity to the hulk king was massive right around the premier of episode 6 they announced that tim blake nelson would be coming as the main antagonist of the new captain america movie new world order and they also announce he d be in thundercats and he d be reprising his role as mutated dr samuel sterns aka the leader. it would ve made sense for dr samuel sterns to be the hulk king since he had a room of bruce banner s blood in the incredible hulk movie also emil blonsky was super lame to I think my favorite part was when wong broke him out of prison for good
this is what happens when you tell everyone that is ok to be mediocre this is what happens when you validate things that doesnt deserve validation  in all honesty I can partially blame the society for this but not all of it when you want a good product you have to get your teeth in it  doesnt matter what you do you gotta be a hard worker this ppl just want to laid back and be validate the future of  tv  is definitely in danger when all this awesome producers writers are retired this is what we gonna get all the time we have to stop validating mediocrity put a stop doesnt matter what your intensions are were if you dont have a good plot just dont try to be this mediocre
they are like restaurant workers spitting in a customer meal because he she insulted them. except that they do it to everyone and in front of them...
translation  you cant fire me  I quit!
if the showrunner couldn t understand the criticism she was receiving  apparently she didn t understand the nature of the culture as well as the actress thought she did.
we trained him wrong as a joke!
ohhh I get it  they are so good to do bad stuff they embrace it
if you go out of your way to not only insult your boss and your clients  but to intentionally do a bad job  in the real world you get a pink slip. at least. I d be sued for damages as an engineer.
Imeant to do that
they say they damaged the  trolls  when these youtubers just got more engagement on their channels from talking about how bad their show is and that the show is performing lower in terms of ratings than any other project  but I guess I ll chalk up one point for the creators of she-hulk for their  hate bait ..I guess. the literal audacity of them to think they broke down some  walls  by antagonizing their audience at every turn just for them to say  it was intentional  they literally said in the finale how they know more about what the fans wanna see more than kevin feige  like I know what Im about to say is a meme but if it was me  I wouldn t of let thatslide.
let s assume for the moment that this is entirely true  and not just desperate gaslighting meant to make the showrunners not look like complete morons whose lives are filled with naught but bitterness and alcohol. the fact that disney has not fired them all without further pay for active sabotage of a disney production and stated that they would never be hired again at disney should be grounds for a shareholder lawsuit given the amount of money flushed down the drain on this project.
gaslighting and scapegoating have no limits.
I hope the disney s investors also liked the trolling...
I wonder what her excuse is going to be when the show doesnt get second season
basically admitting thatsomeone lives rent free in your head is not the gotcha moment you think it is.
never even looked into the show  could only make it through 3 episodes of rings of power before I couldn t watch  I cant watch 90  of the films and shows released these days.
bad is an understatement. she hulk twerking....lmfao.
melonie looks good with her hair up
I d buy that for a dollar
Ive only seen two episodes so far  but I like the show.  just sayin .
problem is the  toxic fan  whom they want to insult  like me  isn t watching the show. therefore  their so-called  victory  tactic against trolls  is useless.
25m an episode for trolling purposes  suuuuuuure
showrunners  deliberately makes content that will offend fans of the ipfans of the ip  complains about those very same offensesshowrunners  you activated my trap card! when this card activates  10 million of our viewers watch your content instead of ours to give us 10 000 points of self-satisfaction.fans of the ip  is now able to quit their job and do youtube full time ha! you fool. now I can make even better content that fans actually want to watch  making your entire studio irrelevant.showrunners  ... did we just.. g4 ourselves
they said they were able to  accurately predict  the trolling comments... but the series finale  spoilers  involves people leaking a sex tape to discredit jen at an award ceremony. did Imiss something  did hulk win any awards  and has anyone leaked sex tapes  awards  or no all the criticism I hear is thatshe-hulk is entitled  narcissistic  shallow  nothing happens  and the writers themselves admit to not having any clue how to write a legal show. were those criticisms anywhere reflected in the  trolls  in the show honestly  when they say they were accurate  are they only referring to the fact that there would be people who vocally didn t like the show  and some of them would be men  I guess thats technically accurate  but its as precise as trying to lob a baseball from california to new york  and then claiming you were accurate because its the same country.
well  what I heard is  she hulk  is so bad  basically it is the last straw breaks the camel s back  including star wars  ms marvel  captain marvel and ect...  the investors now demanded the little mouse to took away some of power from kevin feige. he s no longer in charge all of the marvels tv or movies.
everyne forgot xena the warrior princes  it was a smashing series
oh yeah they really  got me  I didn t watch a shitty show or contribute to them making money but they  got me  alright lol
so now the shareholders have grounds to sue.
so the show was made to troll  haha!!!    wow that is sad if it is true... I couldn t put in the work in something I didn t believe in.
the villain is actually based on the critic doomcock  who legit pissed off hollywood so bad they felt he was one of the bigger threats and decided to make her a real mcu villain lol
I really hate when people say  there were no female heroes when I was younger  jubilee  rogue  storm  wonder woman  scarlett witch  jean grey  cat woman  and of course their source material she-hulk and titania
thats a lie they thought they had a shit load of a community that was gonna support it and get paid big time but realize they messed up. this is blatant back peddling.
and marvel thinks giving these people she-hulk as their trolling playground was money well spent  right
I thought the show existed for me to ignore it. hmmm... weird...
because saying that you already knew that by insulting people they would either insult you back or ignore you  its totally a prediction. you totally need to be a clairvoyant  to get that. they totally got us  wow  Im shocked...
alright  people. you will come up with an excuse for why this show is so terrible that doesnt involve us having been too cheap to throw money behind a sub hero and that its wokeness fault. I dont care what it is! get to it!  1 week later   you said what ! ! ! !
joke s on you I was just pretending .
I d love to see you join friday night tights or az s bbc panels.
all I wanted was some more context for the marvel universe and we got nothing literally nothing
so I have a great idea! let s put out a show that chases the audience away. it will surely make money  right  hahaha
aka  we failed miserably at producing a good or watchable show so now we re just gonna lie and say it was our plan to fail all along!
millions of dollars just to turn us all off and stop watching the show after a few episodes. it bombed.  we meant to do that . uhm... okay.
if you make a bad product on purpose  you shouldn t just be fired  you should be blacklisted from ever getting another job in the industry again.
I find it amusing that they know what the complaints will be. but they refuse to actually fix what they are complaining about. the complaints are valid. plain as the nose on their face. I think the deeper problem is they dont understand problems and how to fix problems or to face the music. they think they re right. despite the fact of the evidence of the universe around them
the art of just decent storytelling is getting lost on writers of most franchises itseems.  if it wasn t for andor surprisingly  I wouldn t have my sub on d . I only skimmed through she hulk to see how daredevil would be handled and regret thinking it would be worth the wait. cool fight scene and dialouge but ehhh..... I hope daredevil  born again goes nowhere near mentioning this she hulk show ever again. but they fucked  so I guess we cant escape it.
I dont understand. did employees just admit they not only failed at their job  but they failed on purpose to piss off their customers  who they hate   wasted company funds  and damaged the company brand and products for shits and giggles  and the admit this publicly without being fired or sued name any other organization where even one part of this crap would be tolerated. this crap is unreal.
thats a billion dollar gamble to make a show just to troll
if they would quit hiring people for the check marks and start hiring people with real talent to write  they will be able to sell their product.
so her trolling was intentional. what does thatsay about her integrity  stooping to the level of trolls only means she wasn t ready to act like an adult and give us good entertainment.
imagine thinking that making your own fans angry is a good idea. sure your show gets lots of publicity but all the future projects suffer.
its sad that marvel beginning I would say in 2013  once the movies started making alot of money. they began to hire woke writers for the comics and movies .  God forbid they hire writers who are fans  comic book collectors.  wouldn t want someone who loves and respects the work to write the comic  show or movie.
this is just damage control. already at the absolutely lowest level of  we were just pretending to be stupid guys honest.
Ive been a fan of the mcu since the beginning.  Ive enjoyed all the movies and shows but she-hulk is probably the first one that I feel like I could ve done without.  the megan thee stallion episode was especially bad  its like they were trying to break a record on how many times they can say someone s name in one episode .this show could ve done the character so much better but instead it makes you not care if she s in anything else.  like if there s an avengers level crisis again  which we know there will be  that just let her stay in la instead of calling her to come be a part of the battle.
they could ve written a good show like agent carter  if they were capable.
if you can predict that fans will think something is going to be crap  why not fix it  its almost like they can see outside their bubble
the problem is nobody s playing in your hand  like they said they re saying nasty things about the fans  so they re literally just getting reaction  because people are pissed. so they are saying they wanted to piss off fans just to piss them off  so that they would say mean things  its literally the dumbest excuse Ive ever heard in my life.
in other news  when peewee herman fell of his bike that time  he meant to do that. film roll at 11.
triggering  critics and delivering free content for critics are two very different things!hell  doomcock gained thousands of new subs after their  attack  on him as the un-intelligentsia
they weren t facing trolls they re facing true marvel fans I really dont think they want to go there and I say they re because they still are!
they should have got the writers from better call saul to do a superhero lawyer show.
hImelonie would you be curious to see the shenmue anime on crunchy roll based on the games its really good
right they did that on purpose. thats a big financial sacrifice.
ah yes of course they made it bad on purpose... bazinga I guess we all fell for their  trap
being honest  when someone says they did something on purpose when it comes out bad. it implies that they can do better if they tried. sadly  with their ideology and lack of talent in scriptwriting. I dont believe even if they really wanted to make a good product  they wouldn t be able to.
can you imagine a corporation purposefully putting out a product that draws no money  seriously  fire these people.
calling the critics trolls is projection. they themselves admit that they were trolling the audience and acting in bad faith and now anyone who noticed it and took issue with it is the bad guy. prime example of gaslighting.
bad on purpose...mission accomplished.
they had enough comic material to appeal to fans  they could ve easily made a great show but their reasoning for making a terrible show was   we made itso bad in order to make it awesome . that is so insanely moronic  its like saying   we burnt the entire forest down in order to stop forest fires
this chick is cool. she took the red pill
6 38 I think this applies to the velma show too. this whole   if you hate it youre ___ist!  is the lamest  non-argument shit ever
the show has become  reality tv !
isn t that just like someone who loses a fight saying  I let you win . why would they make a show to have a go at youtubers when they have never been had a go at. I think captan hindsight helped them.
show was bad on purpose . right. they destroyed three of stan lee s beloved characters because they wanted to  troll the trolls   who the hell are they fooling !they just cant admit that they are shitty writers.
shout out to hypnotic  he shares the same views on this barrel fire
2 22 was just going to type that  how rent free they get to live in their heads  lol. you know they are so creatively bankrupt and narcissistic when they take a beloved comic character and turn her into a middle finger to the fans that loved her. sure  good job. I guess they are convinced hate creating makes good stuff instead of creating with love. then give the surprised pikachu face when the so-called audience backslashes against you and join your created villains. Imean  that is the point of rop  right  chase after a villain long enough  and he will appear  of your own making.edit  guess its time for the cold shoulder and the silent treatment. let s rewatch the good ole hulk and wonder woman series and show them  yes  female heroes are more than accepted. sorry youre just not lynda carter.
lol they just said this because it ended  up being shight. it was not meant to be bad  on purpose
it ended horribly but I liked the actress who played jennifer she hulk  and some of the characters  but its definitely low on the marvel scale.
she-hulk is the final boss of girl bosses.
I do believe everyone is falling for a double fake out here. hear me out... we knew all the way from right around when the show started airing that none of the writing group could write courtroom scenes at all because they had the unmitigated stupidity to say so publicly. since the beginning its become increasingly clear episode by episode that they were superimposeing themselves on jen she hulk. where this really just goes mask off is in one of the interviews over the final episode where jessica outright calls she hulk her avatar. they re trying to play this off as an international thing  but I think its a mistake to take them at their word. that brings me back to the omission that they cant write legal scenes...the question has to be asked how it is that an entire writing group was hired and yet none if them could write the material  for one  we know disney s identity politics crap heavily factors into their hiring practices and even who gets to work lead projects. to put it nicely  the entire team put on full display that the are diversity hires that didn t have the talent or experience to be lead writers at all. thats honestly being charitable however. looking closer at what they actually did  any person could binge watch a bunch of legal drama shows from over the years and mimic the lines or plots. thats not what they did at all. they simply threw a word salad of lines together and thought no one would notice. they even baked in a reference to the depp vs ah trial where they have one of the lawyers object to his own line of questioning. keep in mind that was approximately 6 months ago now after the series has ended and not before itstarted airing.at this point Im fairly certain that they simply cant actually write at all and when they eventually get all the writers in the same room to start working only did they all effectively realize that they had all pretty much lied on their resumes. so instead of fessing up and facing the music  they did this crap. I cant really think of one solid instance where they actually wrote jen in character and not some kind of obvious self projection. hell  one could even say the same of all the characters as they were nothing short of projecting how they thought of them and us the audience onto those characters.
itstill boggles my mind that Im still called an incel for raising the exact same points that even women  bring up about she-hulk
this whole trolling the trolls business is a cop out
okay  so now they ve done the let s make a bad show...joke. does this mean they ll do she hulk justice in a season 2  do we get a good version where the writers actually try please  people were excited to see the character  I hope they take the time to actually try for their fans moving forward rather than purposefully make a bad product out of spite.
should def link articles in description
if you can accurately anticipate every criticism of your show but choose to lean into the issues instead of fixing them  you weren t interested in entertaining the audience in the first place. its not about money  its about sending a message.
this is exactly the kind of thing that can happen when you hire people purely for diversity rather than for merit. qualifications  experience  knowledge  etc  should be the only reason they are hired. not because they have the  right  skin color  the  right  parts between their legs  or they have the  right  sexual preference
4 05 facts!!!!!!!!! pure facts!!!!!!
I bet these show creators writers had boyfriends in high school or college that they treated like crap.when the guys finally had enough and left the  ladies  blamed the men and now everything they do is with vengeance in mind.
its reads to me like theyre trying to say they did it on purpose when in reality they just wrote a horrible story.
maybe its because Im not a top business executive  but it doesnt seem like purposely making a show you know nobody will like or watch is the best use of time or resources.again  I am in charge of no marketing departments  but I fail to see how this would have been considered a successful  or beneficial business venture.
she hulk is actually a cool enough character in the comics. I was able to watch 3 episodes of the show before I stopped watching.was pretty disappointed.if they were actually intentionally making a show to piss off marvel fans... I dont know what to say other than I guess Im cancelling disney plus. so good job  ladies  I guess.
thatseems to be the trend going on in hollywood for over a decade  make the worst movie series possible. what  is there a competition going on down there
the best troll will be the pink slips for the staff. good luck on season doooo...
we made a show just to shit on the people watching us. normal people .... k
I didn t think anyone could be worse than dnd after s8 of got. I guess thats an accomplishment
the only troll thing about mcu is how badly they butchered hulk. I dont think anyone was stressing she-hulk that much before the show was announced lol.
I know exactly how to piss them off! torrenting every single episode they make  for free! then see their reaction! they wont be making a single dollar  let alone making profits! its sort of like counter-trolling! whether its a filmmaker or creators of web series  torrent sites are like their kryptonite!
thats a lots of money just to help people make content for youtube. such nice people. they are definitely going straight to heaven.
sure  it was bad on purpose...so then why did they have to do reshoots and push the drop date back by a couple months  forcing miss marvel to come out earlier  if the badness was done on purpose  lol.
there s so much resistance to a woman just existing in the space of superheroes.  - wow. actually  its pretty well the opposite. I would really like a good she-hulk show. I want to visit the alternate universe where different people ran the show that wanted to make it for everyone - including the  incels .
these women are such geniuses that they probably wont be getting another season. its fun watching them burn marvel to the ground  and those ashes only feed the iron age.
surely this a textbook self own from mcu
its tragic what they did to she-hulk. I like the character. the fact she was used to further the agenda is tragic on so many levels. its tough to get excited for anything marvel related. the trust just isn t there... as much as I want to buy into thunderbolts. even captain america  nwo  seems like it has some promise... with dumb decisions like this. giving this hack writer a job   allowing this project to see the light of day. by the time deadpool and thunderbolts comes out I just may have lost all interest. if they at least offered something we can sink our teeth into  ok. it definitely wont be wokekanda forever. here to 2023 I guess
I keep wondering where the major disney shareholders are  its time for a shareholder lawsuit.
the last episode kinda blatantly said this   and the daredevil episode proved they re at least competent when they want to be. if this is true  which I partly think it is   they then cared more about  making a pointless statement than telling a good story  which doesnt change the fact that the show wasn t good. its like deadpool pointng out lazy writing in his film  but the movie continuing to be lazily written.
I dont understand. making the show a troll from the start meant they did it intentionally to instigate. let s hope no one offs anyone or themself over this or the writers will go to jail for inciting violence.
well jokes on them I never watched anything on disney plus since they change the original disney film s I cant trust anything about it but I do wish I d seen wanda vision!
I feel really bad for she-hulk fans the most. they should know that isn t the real she-hulk  that was a puppet that was made for hate watching and bad writers.
Im curious as to how they think they can make money making programs people do not want to watch.
guess they dont consider the following characters as women.wonder womangamoranebulawasprescue  pepper potts valkeriescarlet witchmariah hill  shield agent black widowshuriokoyejessica jonesyelena belovabecause all of those characters have been in movies or tv and were accepted and sometimes loved by majority of audience.  I d personally watch entire series thats just gamora and nebula... because they are well written characters.
unfortunately for them  critical drinker  quartering  and nerdrotic are much more intelligent than they are and capable of clearly outlining legitimate criticisms of the quality of shows and movies.
ah yes  the convenience of copping out by claiming your intention was failure.
do you know who will be not laughing the next time disney intentionally  trolls the troll  and pulls a bad product on purpose  investors.gross mismanagement of money  at the very best. if some people in the she-hulk cast team wants to tank their product they can use their own money and franchise
she hulk   strangles puppyjess gau  I knew there would be fight back from haters and trolls!!lol
what I dont understand is why somebody would write sh t on purpose  you have a team of writers and a fantastic budget and priceless source material and a built-in fan base... but you just  troll the trolls  with a bunch of garbage  why  but thanks for the video  good stuff!
they d definitely be more self-aware if they didn t constantly spam the word  troll
I watched season 1 because it was so comically terrible  but its true that a watch out of enjoyment or disdain is still a watch  so might have to give season 2  if they even let them  a pass.
so let s get this straight.....they made a horrible show to  troll  the fans so they could  make less money than if it was successful  someone s ass needs to be fired
hey can we make one of your biggest and most confident female characters look like an absolutely wretched glurtch just for the sake of making people mad   we d lose millions! its greenlit! conversations that never happened. writer is a blatant liar.
imagine being so triggered that your entire company spends millions of dollars  months of effort  and countless employees on  trolling the trolls   a tiny amount of vocal fans of the original work . well done disney!
wait  so they spent millions of dollars just to get bad press  ya  right!
they resorted to pulling a pee-wee herman falling off his bike trying to do tricks then saying  Imeant to do that  .hilarious that they think anyone would buy this excuse.  the real villains of this show are the creative team for taking one of the most beloved characters from the comics and putting her in the worst thing the mcu s ever produced.
I knew it would be bad. I didn t want to give them my eyeballs. no views means less money for them.
I was watching the show pirated but after 4 ep I stooped it was so bad that I didn t want to watch it for free
how to change the fabric of the universe according to thor love and thunder  use ancient and insanely powerful artifacts to open a portal to the center of existence and make a wish to a being beyond comprehension.she hulk  just break every rule set up this far out of nowhere and complain for ten minutes.
its about time that the writers addressed the negative backlash of there merely existing a female super hero  after all we all remember all of the complaints that were launched against wonder woman  black widow  storm  rogue  scarlet witch  and the she hulk comic book.... oh wait... there wasn t any.  I guess it was just a really badly written show.
this reeks of someona falling on their face then jumping up and saying  Imeant to do that ...
if they wanted to own the trolls  they could have just made something good instead.
we fail upward  it was the plan all along lol
canthey redo shehulk  with new writers and actors  and people who actually want to entertain and make a funny legal show.
this is a way to show how much money marvel actually have throw away money. who green lighted on making show bad on purpose to troll the whole world in the end  not just the minority who they say the trolls  but everyone else. and spend millions. they must ve had the thought to continue the series for marketing. I dont believe this show was ment to be a  one hit wonder .
thats the worst excuse in the history of excuses
the biggest cognitive dissonance that woke creators cant seem to get a grasp of is they want strong female leads but they are also infallible and perfect from the get-go. women are strong and independent yet should be guarded against the smallest hint of criticism or judgement directed their way.  in order for anyone to be deemed  strong brave  etc.  we have to see them struggle and come out victorious against great odds. purely simple and something a even toddler would be able to understand. I dont know if they are actually too stupid to get it or aware of it  but do it in spite of all the criticism to get a one-up on the supposed  toxic-male fanbase .
melonie sounded spanish when she said disparu lol
saying the show was done badly on purpose its just a cop out to cover up incompetent writers. instead of trying to prove the trolls wrong by making a good show  they  made it bad on purpose . thats what I would say if I didn t know how to write a good story
I deliberately didn t win  on purpose!    every young child s bad loser refrain. this is what the writer s of the tv-series are admitting to is on that level
so when the show gets cancelled because no one is watching  will that also be trolling the trolls
wait...if they knew what the trolling topics would be and that those topics were  unoriginal   wouldn t that mean that these writers are producing ideas that are self-admittedly  unoriginal
lol!!!!!! bad on purpose. suuuuuuure  let s go with that now.
I think all your channels have blown up over shehulk trashing because a  we are officially getting past most fans tolerance threshold for the kind of direction the mcu has been going now with bothe dr strange 2 and a shehulk being the straw that breaks the camels backb  the big comic book channels we had been watching like nando v movie  mr sunday   nerdsynch  comic historian have all not been very critical or acknowledging of our problems with phase 4 mcu  in fact more often they ve praised it like they always praise marvel content unconditionally. c  also amber herd trail and matt walshes movie has kind of fired everyone up a new on these particular culture wars.
what is this trend in hollywood to make meta plots  creating a show about fans of the franchise rather than stories in franchise s world  thats meta. creating a movie or a show referencing real world politics in fantasy  including superhero  franchise  thats also meta. I think those  creators  think they re really smart  but its exactly opposite - not creative at all  a fanfic level of writing.
when I would trip on something obvious or run into a pole  I would say  Imeant to do that .  not one of my friends would believe it  nor should they have.  this is damage control at its worst. well said  no talent and no research  just garbage.
now  I didn t watch the show  but all the stuff in the show I saw from people who covered it was not any of the criticisms that were being tossed at it. if true  that makes this  trolling the trolls  position an even bigger l  in my opinion.
its just a prank bro.
what a horrible rationale for a series. really we now see trolling as a legitimate form of entertainment. the she-hulk creators are not only horrible writers but ethically questionable without any artistry. they are so narcissistic and self absorbed. Im amazed that they not only dont hide their shallow intent but that actually proclaim it with pride.
the 2 primary writers of the late 1970s incredible hulk were women. however upon interviewing them they said that although sometime they  got annoyed  bill bixy push back on one of their writing they state that he made them better writers! wow the 2 sexes working together and women acknowledging help and or positive contribution from a male! I cant believe this is a thing we have to be like wow back in the day!
hold up... they make something bad... then people call it bad... and they call those people trolls wauw thats....borderline r-word
does gao not know what the definition of trolling is  or by calling the critics trolls instead of haters or istaphobes  is she implying that those people dont actually hate the show  but only pretend to  very weird.
dont take anything at face value. it is very convoluted. bad things happen. and  there is madness! always take madness for granted!
nothing created out of spite for its audience is going to be successful.
what they are saying is what we all kind of figured out. the writers room was a bunch of depressed middle school girls whining in the lunchroom.
they re logic is flawed. again what is their target audience   we made a bad show on purpose.... please watch it.
imagine paying people good money to make this shit  on purpose.interesting strategy cotton  let s see how they ever get hired for anything ever again.
I dont spend millions to  get back at someone   must be nice to burn your own money just to look at the other person and laugh like youre burning their money. shrugs
lol these folks are clowns. yea take that! meanwhile I wont be directing season two but I still won!
the fact they were so pissy at legitimate criticism of the downfall of their franchise that they decided to make an entire show  dedicated to mocking the people online who judge them  has got to be one of the pettiest fucking things Ive ever seen. instead of owning up to their mistakes and taking a look back at what they ve done since endgame  they decide to simply blame the people who dare question the current mcu. thats not how you get more views or get people on your side.
I cant comprehend the concept of nuance and satire
so the person abused her opportunity to go after a male audience which then makes the fans hate marvel disney more... victory I guess. hope disney turns and around and says  maybe we shouldn t be attacking our fan base  didn t g4 just get royally fucked by this same behaviour
ha! tricks on us!  they made it bad on purpose!  they really showed us!these writers need to be never hired again as writers.
speaking of writers that ruin a show on purpose  its sad to see that house of the dragon is taking thatsame route.
if you throw a match in a puddle of patrol you can easily predict the outcome.
7 20 Im calling him kevin feegis from now on.
I enjoyed the show very much.the bottom line is there is no way for marvel to 100    please everyone.when wandavision came out  people who just want to be spoon fed the same masculine drama of heroes  because they cant stay focused with short attention spans  completely shitted on the show and called itstupid..because they had to wait and see the story unfold.by mid show things get explained and suddenly these same hypocrites would say how good it is. they called it a slow start  but what can you expect from tik tok generations who need everything explained to them immediately or they re lost. she-hulk was going to face the criticism either way because the same hypocrites that complain that marvel has a repetitive pattern that they are bored with  yet when you break up the pattern and give them something completely the opposite   they still bitch.this isn t just males who are full of themselves and gender entitlement  as if they are the only ones watching the show...this is for all the people that can never be satisfied with anything past endgame. no one is begging these people  who obviously wont bypass the shows for the sake of clicks and likes on their channel  to keep reacting to it. this show was set up to be a straight up comedy. thor love and thunder was exhaustingly very over the top with their comedy  and yet yt critics were not nearly as bashing on it as the she-hulk show.btw  the statement you made about wonder woman being liked and supported by men because you believe they thought it was good  and the she-hulk writer did a horrible job.....wonder woman was a good movie and an absolute savior to keeping dceu alive and kicking from the train wreck of failures that came before it. but perhaps they liked it a lot because the character s costume played into a fantasy of scantily clad women. the she hulk bashing trolls didn t get that kind of satisfaction from her so she became a target before the show even aired. the script went very meta  which many had a problem with  but yet they cant get enough of it from deadpool. whatever...the show is a filler with a few easter eggs here and there. just something to keep the universe in our minds. her beginnings seem comical and meager  for which Im sure her presence later will grow more heavily involved with the gravity of the role she will someday have to be prepared for. same thing was for loki.after years of being some what laughable  he later showed character development and now has a sense of responsibility and gravitas to his future and what part he may have to mature into.well... to each their own opinion. like it. dont like it. the show exists. Ive spent a lot more hours on worse shows than this light hearted one. if youread this all....thanks!
you dont like feet
@melonwatermelon
@melonwatermelon  na but seriously  besides thatscene  the writing is just going downhill purposefully  and its ruining the series  and Imean worse than season 8. yes I do like feet  but not like that larys creep.
if this was there plan why were they defending the first two episodes   and what do the credits say now that they rated the show high  do they change their score knowing that the show was made to fail  will rings of power do the same  is  a new from of   get out of jail free card
I watched she-hunk  1st off  it was bad  but  there was glimpses of what could ve been a decent and interesting story. I think if they would have  leaned into the  law and order  story pieces more  with occasional super-her-o fights  it could ve made for a more compelling story.
well it did feel like an insult to fans because regardless of quality of this show  fans are still paying that d  subscription  buying merch and paying tickets to see movies.
I like your tattoo melonie. where d you get it
a middle finger to the critics... who rated it at 85  on rotten tomatos...yeah. it was a finger to the critics. sure it was. it was a finger to the audience  who rated it at 34 .
marvel fans   boooooooo!!!! she hulk writers   boo you  boo all of you!!
well  that taught me a lesson. that ll make me think about being a male again  I wont do that again. I just dont know what I ll do now that the patriarchy has been so thoroughly smashed.the fact I didn t watch it at all doesnt matter. gaos genius and wit was so devastating it flowed over the bounds of reality and made me realise just how a horrible person I was was because of my genitals...and probably skin colour  Imean  they always have to have a go at whitey as well dont they.
oddly  for some reason I dont believe them about trolling trolls. I think they failed and are trying to save face.
she hulk was bad on purpose  so they wanted to loose money on it
she-hulk is only bad because we decided to make it a deliberate choice... what are you jessica  like 5 years old  so now they ve played that card they have zero excuses for the 2nd season to be nothing but pure quality I guess  my bet is they wont do a season 2 and leave it as a win. in their heads at least
youtubers - get paycheckwriter- second season cancelled it just a joke bro
Im so glad the economy is doing so well that these jobbers can waste everyone s time and lots of people s money to make a purposeless bad show. thanks  the market is oversaturated with them lately..
you are lovely and Christian. not that we aren t all in general  but youre great I dunno how I subbed to you but Im glad I did. youre on par with anna tswg. but youre I dunno  nicer
really reads of  cant make fun of me if Im in on the joke
what makes a tv show good is one worth watching  adding current day politcs as a plot narrative into them diminishes the quality of it even today and ruin any future it has like reruns. they can pretend they were courageous and brave for making this hot mess but it comes off as cowardly and petty and the brand suffers cause of it. if only stan lee was alive today...
hell  she could have used that old trope water is wet when it comes to their dialogue with online trolls .  all she really did was prove how untalented her and the writing staff were.  I didn t wathc it though so I dont know the exacts.  I did catch a sippet with the   she-hulk smash matt murdock.   I dont know how my eyes stopped from rolling out of my head.  anyway  God bless.
if I was an investor  I would sue. to make something that was was meant to fail and lose money sound illegal to me. if I was marvel I would take action against the creators of purposely trying to damage the brands name.
I hope k.e.v.i.n either cancels the show or reboots it with a new writing staff. have jen wake up in a hospital after the car crash so bruce can give the transfusion as in the comics.
what if they make it bad on purpose how canthey make money
Im yelling bs.  they found out how bad their show was and now their making excuses.   I dont believe for a second they made a show with the intent that it would fail and loose money.  I do believe they they intended to make a woke television show with the intent on preaching   the message  and it turned out to be an epic fail.  hence the excuses  the final episode  and of course  blaming the audience for their failure.
so basically black adam was made for the fansshe-hulk is made for the trollsdafuk!
contrary to popular opinion  I actually enjoyed most of she hulk in the kind of way thats  its so bad  its good.  like  it was enjoyable with its consistency of nonsense  sloppiness and cringe. therefore  in my eyes  the show was pretty ironically entertaining. so  regarding the show creators  trolling the trolls   they failed! ha-ha-ha! because not every so-called  troll  out there disliked what they banked on for  trolls  to dislike!plus  they also failed to give the show a narrative appropriate for their intended message. now  what do Imean by that  Im referring to the show s dating narrative. the show has she hulk date a bunch of men   so-called  trolls   thus giving a false narrative that akin to she hulk and her dates mutually trying their best to give themselves and their partner a pleasurable experience  the show creators and show runners tried their best to give a show thatsatisfies all its audience. when in fact the creators and runners intended message is   troll the trolls. screw everyone who disagrees with us. the real problem isn t an audience losing interest in mcu movies and shows. the real problem s that the general public and or world isn t woke enough or feminist enough. although on the flipside  maybe the creators meant to fail to give a proper narrative  because the whole show was meant to be a failure to begin with  after all.
Im calling bullshit. initially  I think these people actually thought this was going to be a smash hit. when it flopped and the only thing everyone could talk about was how it was hot trash  now its   well we just did it to troll . maybe when they seen how bad they bombed  they switched to trolling  but I dont believe for a second that was the original idea.
I thought they said they didn t care about youtubers.  oh well.
Goddamn melo
no wonder they keep rising the prices on parks  there s no way their making money on this!
gao and co  deserve to be fired after publicly admitting there was no rhyme or reason to the series other than  owning the trolls.
loved you last night. you were screaming for hours
I dont think they actually understand what an internet troll is lol
the point is to be entertaining enough to leverage making money. if you shun your audience and dont have a product people want to see  well dont take my word for it  look at the prime example over at g4.
must be nice to have so much money to just throw away
show ended almost two weeks ago and people are still ranting about it. it lives rent free in every hater s head at this point.
so thats how they value the time of their fan s  that they made a bad series and now they re bragging about it  how it was planned to waste the time of all viewers and after that they are telling to people who are pissed  that they are toxic!
I wouldn t even feel bad if she hulk writer gets doxed
if this statement is true about the show writers....that is alot of money to be spending in a studio that doesnt belong to you. this also reveal s why the long time fans of the marvel comics ip was so concerned about the direction of all of the stories. this behavior puts on display as to who these types of people they are and what little respect to the source material  if they even bothered to review it  they had to build. they took a great opportunity for many first time entertainment folks and took a big steamy poop on their experience. they think that they got back at the salty yt reviewers  however you just kicked all of the actors and actresses right in the gooch and taints  you made these foilks think they were apart of something special and youreally just used them all for dunking on the most vocal of reviewers on yt who called you out on many of your shenanigan s. bravo mcu  bravo....you clearly got us....but it cost the careers of the people you put in front of the camera.....because are they really going to be able to work in any other studio after the bonfire you created at marvel studios cools to embers  I wouldn t touch any of them with a 25ft pole....
they actively ignored one of the key elements of the internet  dont feed the trolls.
it isn t our fault the writers didn t read and adapt the source material. my wife  who is two toes from the line of sjw cant support this show. this was specific to jessica gao and her desire to hurt fans with heroes. so far all  this does  is make me miss 1989-2001 tv and movies even more.
if you dont love my crap... I will brand you as a troll!!!  Ive been branded far  far worse than a  troll  for disagreeing with the message.   troll is an actual upgrade at this point.
spawns cgI in 1997 is better than she hulks
they took an opportunity to make a strong  independent  and kind female lead  and they turned it into a joke. goes to show you how much they really care about female empowerment female problems. now the only thing these writers will be known for  is the time they took a top tier character  and made themselves a laughing stock by making a thinly veiled attempt to bash on the very same fan base that gave them their jobs. now we know what they have to offer...nothing.
she hulk gives me low hopes for lokI season 2.
sounds like she has a serious case of tommy wiseau-itis  director of the room. tommy wanted to make the greatest dramatic movie ever made. made  the room   and it was more of a comedy than any drama.after all the laughs at his expense  he came out and said   uh  Imeant for it to be a comedy ! so  right gao..
the  female not welcome in the superhero space  is a self fulfilling prophecy for these types. men hate women superheroes so let s write her as a heck you to men etc. wow men dont like our character  we knew it!
they litterally fed the trolls
so instead of making a good show she made a bad one to own the troll.  my God kevin should make an example of her and scold her.
awktually  here at marvel  we we re trolling you  ......riiiiiiight.  you look  wow!   with your hair up btw
what they re not saying ... is that this type of program  designed to fail  is a scam  and its the producers who profit from it. its the plot from mel brooks   the producers   which is these days a reality. producers  realizing they are unable to produce actual quality shows  are turning to purposefully producing stinkers. for mel brooks  the stinker was the musical  springtime for hitler.  for modern producers  its  rings of power    she-hulk    wonder woman 2   just about anything on cw  and so many others. the producers promise investors a blockbuster  and they sign a list actors  but then behind the scenes they hire rookie writers and directors in order to destroy the product  and the audience is aged 48-58  and not the younger demographic that advertisers covet. who profits  the producers  who are scamming hugely off the top! who takes the blame  the audience! and apparently shareholders are falling for it  but maybe no longer at wb  which has changed management. amazon and disney investors are still getting soaked  and whoever is paying for marvel and dc comics  they re getting soaked.when quality is low  investors are getting scammed. that is an immutable law of business. bad management - which has been running their own scam on investors  and has proliferated during this period of easy money from federal reserve policy - is setting up companies for a rude awakening like at wb  or a crash  as seems likely at disney.
by referring to she hulk as  her avatar  to act out how she sees the world proves the youtubers and critical fans correct. she didn t write jen as is she used the established character to preach her feminist nonsense.
if  Imeant to do that  was a multimillion dollar money laundering operation.
you know  the best way to actually get back at the critics is make a good show. but nope  they d rather get high on their own stink. have these folk matured beyond adolescence
so a tiny amount of people wanted to get back at another tiny amount of people by wasting a huge amount of money that wasn t theirs...
I like she-hulk character  and will not let these goobers destroy my affinity for her. I hope marvel can learn from this and realize that they need to find fans to create their property. because other than that you just get petty creators who dont care whether the property is destroyed. iron man became as popular as it is because of love that jon had for the ip. please dont hire any more petty people.
female actors that have never been a part of this universe. dont understand the complexity  and how faithful fans want people to be to the material. I have no problem whatsoever with a female actress  taking on a superhero role as you mentioned  wonder woman  as I ll probably example and how successful that was but are above the dc properties. wonder woman was the most successful pro for the entire franchise  which is unfortunate but when she hulk  they had an opportunity to do another slam dunk like miss marble was  I thought thatseries was very kind hearted and family friendly. and they should ve been more episodes where she defended either more villains or superheroes themselves  and made it really complex to the point where she may have had to rescue them at one point as she hulk.
so basically it was made to make fun of men. some people think that qualifies as a storyline.
few fun facts about jessica gao  she was born in california in 1984  which is already ominous as fuck. she s also credited as having written that episode of rick and morty... you know   the one. seems to me her talent lies in hamfistedly self-inserting herself into series just to shit on people she doesnt like. textbook example of failing upward.
we ll show these toxic fans .... we ll intentionally make a bad show ....that ll show them ......somehow. I sincerely have no idea what they think they proved. if anything  its that fans are too lenient  not  toxic  enough  with the morons writing and producing ip they care about.
I will always praise she ra and the princesses of power for how they imo perfectly wrote their strong female characters. everyone felt real. everyone had flaws and strengths. everyone was pretty much equal imo  even though a majority of the characters were women . women weren t treated as better than men  men weren t treated as better than women. itseems like that is what true feminism started out to be bit nowadays shows like she hulk generalize all men as stupid a holes  the very thing feminists nowadays hate  generalization  and all women as being right and getting everything they want in the end
saying the quartering inspired an mcu bad guy is like saying kylo ren was inspired by darksydephil. are you 100  sure this is actually the case
and they actually published this article
how is creating something awful just to upset people who would be upset at that awful thing an excuse for making something awful  that excuse does not provide any evidence that they could make a good show if they didn t decide to do something so stupid  if we play along with their framing. indeed itshows such poor judgement that  even if true  it provides evidence they wouldn t be able to write a good show even if they didn t try but did-- so to speak.
the one  with the pickle  I am pickle riiiiiiiiiick!!!
yeah  we meant to do that....
I hate the fact they wasted my time for 9 episodes just to troll and get revenge on people they have issues with.  for the people in the middle like myself who could care less about the issues of identity politics  feminism  wokeness or any of the nonsense that people are always complaining about nowadays  all I wanted was a decent show but no I couldn t get that because Im caught in the middle of some bs culture war.
the whole idea of triggering  projecting  or calling people snowflakes and the like just seems so lost on these people. no one can be triggered if they dont care. its actually quite the opposite of being triggered. we re just having a laugh at their expense and unlike them  I ll sleep just fine. lol
this is the problem with marvel and disney now.  trying too hard to send a message and giving up what your audience really wants to be entertained.  going into the toilet.
to troll us  seriously thats it and I was expecting a good comment yet disappointingly its  bad but again its not the first time I was disappointed just like how marvel agreed to be brought by the rat.
translation.we spent milions of dollars and thousands of man hours for the lolz.
it takes an amount of arrogance I couldn t imagine to deliberately make a terrible show with the expectation of pissing off critics  and all so jessica and the rest of her fellow cat ladies can say they were right expecting the critics were horrible in the first place.  let s really think about that.  thats like the person in charge of the school cafeteria hating the kids who go there during lunch break  she thinks the little turds do nothing but complain  so okay.  she puts  insert nasty secret ingredient here  to give the kids  fill in something embarrassing here! .  the kids are embarrassed totally and complain  and the chef says   see !  you see! !  I knew you d complain!  youre little bastards! disney and the mcu spent many  many millions and wasted almost as much time helping jessica and her band of neo-feminists to create a television show because they disdain and hate certain members of the audience and couldn t care less about the rest.  Ive really got to ask  is this an abberation  or is it typical of the pure narcissism in our elites   if so  only people who think they re so damn right all the time could be so completely wrong!we weren t asking for much  just to be entertained.  but they couldn t even do that  and thatsomehow makes fans like us the bad guys   the editors and writers for marvel and dc s comic books have had the same attitude for years.  they put out subpar shit and when we dont love them  they claim victimhood and blame us.  oh  they also say cute little things like  if you dont like my politics  dont buy my book. the worst part is  the  inclusive  execs who wanted to score brownie points hiring these wingnuts are too scared to fire them  otherwise they ll get bad press!  thats why bullies like heather antos are working steady in spite of the industry sliding down the slope.  and heather is just like jessica  she sees any criticism and anger toward her for being a bad person as somehow positive!  I really couldn t imagine what its like to be that kind of person  and I wouldn t want to!
all they have succeeded in doing is pushing me even further away from watching anything in the marvel series productions.
wow  the amount of coping they re doing is unreal
oh  so they made the show bad on purpose as a way to troll marvel s critics. its just like the time I got an f on my report card on purpose to troll my parents. I was all like  you guys being angry about this just shows how tired and predictable you are lol.  the little troll inside of me was so happy.
when yourealise fortnite made she hulk better...than whatever that was
the creators were happy to  troll  people who they felt would not like their product .. to what end is it productive to alienate the fans that gave you the ability to make your product in the first place. comic book  nerds  made this possible. no one outside of comics  comic books  knew or understood the power of storytelling in this media.
here s a crazy thought.hire a writer not based on their gender race nationality or skin color but based on how well they can write.like successes in their track record.best-selling novels awarded screenplays etc...then make a tv show that apealls to men and women if its a superhero based show have it not be about sex but instead about good vs evil good guys vs bad guys
tbf this strikes me as a  nuh uh Imeant to do that  when you fail to do something and get laughed at.but then coming out and saying that is also not the optic they are looking for  not the smartest bunch of writers eh
I like how they call peoples who dislike their stuff   trolls  . I get it we are in a time where   hate porn reviews   are very popular but still when the majority of peoples think the show is mediocre bad  and it apply to alot of recent shows not just she hulk  with very clear arguments of why it actually bad and can develop on it for like 10 minutes  ... as a producer you might do well to actually try to consider giving their opinion a minimum of credibility as they are clearly anchors in your fan base when it come to the general opinion.we are in a weird time where big franchises seem to try to self destruct for some reasons it weird.
these writers and director should never be allowed near comicbook content ever again
this reminds me of a line from the discworld novel small Gods   it takes a mind like vorbis to plan revenge before the thing youre getting revenge for vorbis  is a religious fanatic in a theocratic dictatorship  that is the only religion on all of discworld that is actually wrong. the disc actually has a magical feild that actually turns belief into a force. if enough people believe in something  it actually comes into existance. all the Gods of every religion on the disc actually exist  and they get stronger every time humans worship them and get weaker if they stop doing it. also  sometimes 2 cultures interact  and then the 2 Gods merge and the new God has to keep changing wigs or putting on fake boobs or something.the omnian empire  however  is so opressive and so intolerant of anyone saying they dont believe in om  ironically no one actually believed in om anymore and om  starved of belief  died. he only came back to life at the start of the novel because of one young boy who ll literally believe anything you tell him. and even then  he came back in the form of a small turtle. everyone keeps trying to eat him and om is considdering making eating turtles a sin. vorbis is basically the pope dictator and he s described as having  a sane mind made of inside parts  and has black eyes. he s technically an atheist but also a hypocrite and he punishes people for even thinking of honouring anyone but om.he did something to p    off another country that was basically the discworld equivalent of ancient greece  they retaliated  and then vorbis launched a counter-attack he d actually been planning months prior. if you know how  trolls  are gonna react  and you do it because you know how they ll react  you are not the victim and they are not the trolls.
does anyone honestly believe that they put time  effort and quite a bit of money into trolling their actual audience of course not  what we have here is creators trying to make lemonade from the dogshit they created.
I hate trolls  I trolled trolls  that means Im a troll  ergo I hate myself . .yup that pretty much sums up what the writers gave us through self insertion so they re not wrong technically
Im curious if the people who finance these  creators  will be thrilled to find out they invested in a project which was created to specifically push away audiences.or do they just have zero talent
instead of making a show thats bad on purpose to troll the people who will inevitably hate it because it was designed to be hated  why not just make a good show instead    the logic boggles the mind.  in what universe does this even begin to make sense
1 12 how far back are they going because as far as I know  moon knight was fucking amazing and praised to high heaven as well as black widow  shang-chI  spiderman  etc.3 01 I dont get how people like her constantly think that people ignore or scoff at female superheroes when pretty much the most popular ones as of now....are women  just like how jen disrespected hulk and his trauma  you got the she hulk cast scoffing at the beloved female superheroes and villains.3 35 this just showed people how thin skinned the crew was tbh.
knowing that fans will be upset over a shitty product doesnt make you clever. its a self fulfilling prophecy
its like someone tripping and falling  then trying to play it off. they re such transparently juvenile clowns. I wouldn t doubt they maybe talked about this once they realized they had nothing close to an actual show s worth of content. we see right thru you clowns.
if I walked into work naked  started swearing at everyone and punched the receptionist in the face  I could probably accurately predict how everyone would react.if I were to walk into work with boxes of pizza and doughnuts  I could also probably accurately predict how everyone would react.just because your predict how the reaction will be doesnt make you cleaver. in fact everyone else predicted the same reaction! the truly cleaver thing to do would have been to create something that was enjoyable in a way no one predicted.in reality  isn t it more telling that if the show was deliberately bad then the people who say they liked it are really just idiots who fell for the trap of liking it
there are easier  cheaper ways to  troll the trolls
so if this show was meant to be nothing more than a  parody to trigger people does this mean  that a she-hulk show could still be made  a series that honors not only the source material  but also their fans  the hard work and dedication that other writers  directors  actors  and everyone that built up what we all love the mcu stands for  can still be made everyone we still have a chance for a good entry for she-hulk! in all serious though  someone needs to get a lawyer team together and sue these people for wasting resources and abusing loyal subscribers dollars to deliver this series of episodes...for a joke.
so  painting a caricature of an already liked character to spite fans  is what we re going with now  mkay.
I hope marvel sues her for this. lol
it was a big f you to the trolls  yeah  right. this was a writing staff for a superhero law dramedy that admitted that they cant write courtroom scenes.no what really happened was everyone denounced it as garbage. it didn t make the top ten in viewing. the writers were exposed as trash woke-mongers. saying  lol it was a troll  is simply gao s clumsy attempt at damage control. I hope she keeps us appraised about her upcoming projects so we can not watch those too.
nothing I have seen has made me want to watch this show. we are now in an era where hollywood is so pompous and delicate that they cant take criticism. it was bad enough before that they flaunted their wealth  now they want to gaslight people that dont like their content like we re a bunch of peasants thatshould take what we are given.
this has to be the most expensive self-own in history. she hulk is a monument to one spiteful  writer  who used millions of dollars of disney s money to be low tier troll  couldn t even get to God tier with all that expense ! . the most pathetic part being that jessica gao thinks that any man who watches this will be suffering some kind of  sick burn   !
smh let s be honest  ppl were gonna troll no matter what. ppl been bitchin all about phase 4 since wandavision. so idc thatshe-hulk turned out the way it did. I fucks with it.
2 16 I thought the villian was more doomcock overLord dvd.
they are  making fun of their own straw man interpretations. either the writer of this article has terrible grammar  in which case they should not be a professional writer  or the creators of the show are quoted as saying their own interpretations are based off of straw man arguments. so  that would basically be saying that their own criticisms of those who criticize their product are baseless. good to know you are at least aware of your own hypocritical attitudes ladies.
no one watched the show.  how did they own me   asking seriously because I didn t watch a single episode.
even doing it on purpose was an l thing to do....so instead of proving critics wrong and making them look dumb by making something  actually good......they decided to prove to the critics they cant do better and their criticism is correct  its like joining a basketball team you hate  and making them lose on purpose.....you lost too!!
as a fan of a character I shouldn t have to watch all the b s bickering garbage behind the scenes interviews of tongue in cheek hissy fits to understand the show. I purposely watched the entire first season without knowing the details of the references... didn t understand a gash dag thing. I felt like mr. immortal  which sadly enough is how many marvel fans felt. I even wrote to them saying  Im a vulnerable adult male  and I hope youre not making fun of me. sometimes it takes me a while to understand people being mean to me. I see that they lied when they told me no  not at all. as a man I feel attacked  and left out. if youre a women and you want to make a point fine  but this is not how you do it. think about how much each episode cost. if you had a problem with how women are being treated  I would have donated that money to an organization thats fighting to change that. this just seems like a cash grab  shame  and a need to be right. oddly enough causing more and more women to fall into the trap of attempting to do this in their everyday lives... but they dont have  I work for marvel  type money  so it just ends up being this  she-hulk writers   Godzilla. Godzilla shows a woman how to easily beat rodan. Godzilla forces women to fight rodan. do you understand
if it weren t for trolls  no one would pay attention to them.
shehulk isn t a bad character in the 90 s comics. they ruined this character.  coulda been awesome.
a parody show can be entertaining.  the simpsons  south park  family guy  and yes  much easier for cartoons to do so  but that doesnt mean live action cant do it.  heck  deadpool is a parody  and its sure doing well!
so wait - from now on  they are going to write into their stories aspects that hit back against fans  and use up precious screen time and dialogue to put marvel fans down  rather than tell a good story...for the same fans       can anyone spot the problem with this are they f cking serious  has kf lost his marbles
well  traditionally marvel has a fan base made of straight males  so I dont believe for a minute they do something just to trigger their fan base  simply  they ve failed  and now trying to get away with it. Im not exactly a fan  but  for example  I really appreciated hawkeye  because I like both hailee steinfeld and florence pugh  the chemistry between them  etc  even if I didn t like the kingpin in the show  so  its not true that males dont appreciate movies and tv shows if the stars are female
I remember when marvel first announced a potential she-hulk show on netflix before disney  was a thing  I was so excited. the hulk s are some of my favourite characters  the cartoon from the late 90 s on space channel was the best.this show was so terribly bad and just absolutely was such a let down. why the hell would they hire some weirdo like this who talks to kevin like this .its self-insertion  she legitimately says  I would have written a 10 minute conversation that we ve really had  like the show isn t about you. its about she-hulk  the people who created she-hulk  and the fans who made she-hulk what it was..they decided to crap on everyone thing that even allowed she-hulk to be a thing for her to get a job to make a show about. disgusting.
just subscribed great video
the show was pretty much marvel showing they dont care about the fans anymore  they did up to end game but now they are pretty much being star wars and just doing whatever they want  regardless of it making any sense or logic  pretty much the last decade means nothing to them now and the fan base they built they see as their enemy now.
they lost millions of dollars to troll people. uh huh.
wait it took them 3 years to write this ! love how the creators try to spin this into some sort of gotcha against the critics. as if burning a lot of money in a garbage fire is somehow a victory for marvel.
we still have spiderwoman  there s still hope of having more decent female mcu characters  black widow was awesome
if you troll the trolls then the trolls aren t trolls  but you are. also  how is it possible thatsuch people have a job !
I call bologna  they re rationalizing because they cant except the fact that people hated their work.
if they started this project 3 years ago and planned on the backlash happening  why would they make the show at all  probably just to validate themselves with their terrible ideas in their echo chamber
how stupid do they think people are  sure you made a series entirely to piss people off and likely get cancelled  riiiight.
as a  f u  to critics huh  is that right you know how in the last episode she confronts her own writers and says that her story is shit  seems like mixed messaging to me.because they already did parody their critics within the show  thats how insanely insecure they are  but then turned around and basically admitted that those critics were right. ah yeah  sounds like an fu to the critics alright. if youre bipolar that is.
its like playing a game and losing..and be like  lol not my main  or  Im not playing fr fr
when marvel allows snobs to make garbage shows like this it really hurts the brand as a whole. I read she hulk comics as a kid and was looking forward to the show actually. but it went out of its way to make me hate the protagonist and make man hating jokes every five seconds
my takeaway from this video.. they knew 3 years ago that this show was going to be ass. wild..
worst thing they did was throw she hulk under the bus. hating the fans is one thing but the damage done to a beloved character  notably female  is irony at its worst.
so  marvel decided it would be more profitable to to make a bad show in order to  troll the trolls  than to make a great show to enthrall marvel fans who knew there was any money in trolling trolls who was supposed to watch she-hulk  just trolls  so you could troll them  are there enough trolls to make-up viable viewership
so better to be evil than incompetant
the measure of a man is what he does with power. that goes for women as well. instead of creating something great  they decided to worry about  online trolls . instead of killing them with success  they decided to show how petty and vindictive they are. how is marvel allowing this
they actually admitted its bait for luring children online and hooking up with 9 year olds.
so they pissed away millions of dollars and further damaged the marvel brand name and the careers of everyone involved with the show just to troll marvel fans   well done!  you certainly got one over on us.
this is pure cope. this isn t the first time they ve wheeled out the  x show isn t supposed to be good and thats okay . I cant remember what the other one was  but I remember it happening. it was awful  and they need to justify it by saying  hehe we made ya mad huh   its kinda funny that fiege was even like uhh I know this is feminist propaganda but this is kinda overselling it.
I absolutely do not believe for a second she wrote thatshow because for it to suck   damagecontrol
the best way for she-hulk crew to have punked youtubers would have been to make a well written  and awesomely fun show.what was the budget for this temper tantrum of a show seems to be an expensive insult. I think they punked themselves. maybe this will be a wake up call to feige to get him back on track. hope they all get fired. bring back favreau  russo bros.  markus   mcfeely and the ones that love and know the comics.reboot a proper she-hulk. the character and the fans deserved better.super hero women are not just limited to marvel and dc. what about michelle yeoh  she s used her dance background and degree to become one of the best and most beloved martial arts super heroes of all time.  fight choreography is just like dance choreography. I want to do that. I can do that  -- m. yeoh.win goes to fans and youtubers. loser is marvel. they did it to themselves.
when a child draws me a picture I pretend to like it but when theyre grown and paid to do so im going to critique it
its very embarrassing to see that these youtubers creating videos in their living rooms with fifty dollar budgets are garnering far more views than this professionally produced television series. the word pathetic comes to mind.
I never get the idea of resistance to female superheroes. outside of hercules  almost all my hero shows in the 1990 s and early 2000 s were women. ripley in aliens  sarah connor in t2   xena the warrior princess  buffy the vampire slayer  tru in tru calling  the halliwell sisters of charmed  lynda cart  synonymous with wonder women and beloved by nerds   hell I watched sailor moon  the female power rangers were the only reason I watched the power rangers  that and being 10   dark angel  created by james cameron   hell even modern times  orphan black was kickass with the actress that plays jen walters leading the role. she was the hero of thatstory.  what s so annoying and sick about the argument these people make is that it erases all the female heroes everyone could admire and look up to in the past  with the idea that these represent the first female superheroes.
thats a very expensive trolling  nicework genius!
so disney is okay spending millions to create a terrible show in order to satisfy a writer s grudge against a few you tubers critics. this makes no sense. I dont think stockholders will think this is okay.
you cant fire me because I quit.
I just  think . this your granted  25 million  per episode budget9 episodesthats 225 million dollars now hold on before we say hey thats not too much.  things I am sure where not countedtravel expenses to and from   ie  I live in japan ya better fly me first class to .. and back home  housing cost for those who dont live close to the studiorental cars food expenses off cameracatering and special diets the premiere partyswag bagssomething to consider  for those who dont think thats too much there are  folks breathing down the necks of animators   cgI  etc. its crunch time we need this stuff  done quickly .  folks who after the cameras  stop rolling are still working  late nights  many times unpaid     missing important times with family and so much more . the ones  who do most of the real work. to that end the human hours  spanned out over the  real hard  workers not these stars  has to range in the 10 s of thousands of hours bear in mind this was not a month long process to  get out these 9 episodesfilming began in mid-april 2021 in los angeles and atlanta  georgia  and lasted until mid-august. thats 5 months of filming uprooting folks as the  cast may have  missed important things  with family and friends to be ready to fly out  if need be. all of this to be lets do a show that will blast the trolls lets define trolls  when that term became a thing trolls where folks who would write  nasty stuff to get a rise out of folks . it was about  wanting to see this and that person become unglued and unhinged. thats all and hopefully see  a nasty note  writen back to them  how dare they as teh troll giggles  knowing they  got the person good now trolls are anyone who writes  anything bad about a show or  whoever . cause they really believe teh person is bad . a troll in todays world is someone who doesnt agree  that rings of power with a woman  who seemingly could do no wrong. you have  every  God damn american  soldier  from all branch s of  the service  from air force to navy  all go against  a monster  dragon and they all be killed  but   this  gladreil  comes in  kills the dragon   with some impossible  flying dance  skills and a dagger. a group of people look at it  and say its  bs  and  that was crap and its look at all those  women hating trolls. the reality is folks are  calling the show onto the floor and saying the back drops where shoddy  the action was poorly unbelievable etc  . they are folks who actually buy merch. they have 500 dollar  one ring to rule them all  they have sword replicas  they have  thousand  plus  dollar  outfits  made of teh highest quality . they have leather bound books . they actually have  exclusive  dvd blu ray sets . they have the soundtracks on physical cd . . they have collections  worth thousands of dollars.  they live and breathe tolkien . they are mad  to see their  beloved   series  being ruined  and they are the ones  the woke  who dont buy  jack  on  shared accounts causing us  to pay more a month for our  accounts  that dont share our accounts more !  yea  so  how are  the woke making the world a better place  but to she hulk . sorry for teh tangent . lets make a show that  sucks   and waste more than likely 500 million dollars when its all said and done  . with offending the real folks  who  could buy a few million dollars in merch to make it  worth it for teh studio to say hey  lets toss a  second season out look at the positive  views and the mouse and his   secret agents  didnt have to choke out anyone and  we didn t have to filter negative reviews yes please lets waste folks time and  millions of the mouses money to make a crap show and bring marvel down . just as  we have  wakanda forever coming out soon and about to begin the new  phase   hoping to bring folks to teh cinema  vs  wait for the show to hit  disney plus. its sad  even the parks are having issues  bring in  folks
it really sucks cause tatiana is why I wanted to watch the show as well as giving she-hulk a platform to exist  but the fact that they were doing this to childishly stick it to a demographic  is sad. I loved tatiana when she was in orphan black  she was amazing and talented along with a great script. and even back then tatiana was progessive and more accepting. but now since she s with woke-vel  she sadly got corrupted and is now woke. there s a big difference between being tolerant and accepting in being progressive versus the 4th reich of femi-nazism of  tolerant  intolerance thats taken the culture. ... sad.
yeah really stuck it to the youtube critics  by giving them a ton of content and views criticizing your show. gottem!
man sure wish I could spend millions of dollars for no reason other than to trigger people in a tanking economy.
so they  wasted  how many millions of dollars on this show just to  troll the trolls    that actually makes sense for disney these days
here is a way to own trolls. make it good.its not really owning the trolls if you make them right.this article is copium from the showrunners to explain away their incompetancy. remember  they said they didn t know court room dramas. they admitted to their incompetancy first. now its it was to own the trolls after the bad reception.also how does she accurately predict the backlash  one of the trolls in the show ranted about making your own characters rather than co-opting preexsisting characters. that doesnt add up in that universe and she-hulk being real in that universe. that criticism doesnt make sense within the universe but does is ours as in their universe these characters are real whereas in ours they are written. this is pure copium.
this sounds like pure cope from people who cant handle criticism and have allowed the critics to get into their heads.
when is the melonie mac onlyfans dropping !
so   what was their reason for writing all the female characters as petty  catty  selfish   narcissistic  and or vapid stereotypes  the one thing I walked away with from thatshow is that the people who treat women the worst are other women  and they do it with a smile. despicable.
so they decide to take the fans  the ones who ve been clamoring for a live action she-hulk for decades even when all they had was a production still of brigitte nielsen in a green leotard and a fright wig  the ones who were crossing their fingers and hoping and wishing and praying for them to succeed... and shit all over them for nine weeks straight just to get under the skin of trolls. thats 4d chess there. if the d stands for  dumbass.
marvel disney has actively hated the fan base for years. thats why I stopped watching any of their product. unless youre a professional reviewer  just quite giving them time and money. they ll eventually get the message.
storm had always been a great superhero. she s also a black woman wow
so the incredible ho will just continue to lose viewers while the show runners continue to out themselves as immature  vindictive  and deluded.
so basically they show a complete lack of respect along with a overwhelming amount of contempt for male marvel fans  I wanted to like she-hulk  and I saw a potential for it to turn around. but there is a complete lack of any character development. its also clear thatshe-hulk is based on the writers emotions and feelings  it makes me feel like the writers are unable to write about anything they haven t experienced themselves. that can be explained by bad writing  but its clear this wasn t just bad writing  it goes beyond that and its clear that the writers they hired hate the marvel fandom. the fact that marvel was willing to play along and let them do something like this disgusts me. imagine if they had done something like this to female marvel fans I refuse to watch anything she-hulk  and Imay be limiting how much I watch of anything marvel from now on. the disrespect they have shown to their fans is a huge turn off to me and itshould have consequences. hopefully the dc universe will be turning around with black adam and I ll be able to become a dc fan instead of a marvel fan.also disparu was way more entertaining to watch than she-hulk.
the cope is real.
definition of gaoism  doing something awfully incompetently while screaming out loud that everybody is going to hate his her work  so as to be able to say in the end  I told you so! I told you you were going to hate my work! I was always right about what the result of your evaluation of my work was going to be. therefore Im a genius! ... what a twisted mind. this is not cognitive dissonance because she knows she just made a massive pile of crap. she acknowledges it. what I see in her behavior is a scared child who was so afraid of taking this project in her hands that  since its inception  made everything to fulfill her doom prophecies and now tries to escape her responsibility by saying  you knew I couldn t handle it. you knew I was the worst. so why did you hand me that weight I couldn t bear. all this is your fault. bu ...
I wish I could piss away millions to take pot shots at people who criticises me Imean its a winning strategy to waste one of your best characters on something petty
im done with marvel I efuse to even bother with a marvel film when its released to cable dvd they told me they dont want my money so they get nothing from me
males have no issues with sarah connor  ellen ripley all strong female leads from way back when woke word wasn t even a thing.
I hope these writers dont touch anything else marvel has in the future
too bad this wasn t released to bomb in the theatres. so do these shows have commercials defraying their costs  is the model that people buy the subscription as a whole  so individual streaming shows dont have any direct competition or impetus for quality. they re just filler  as long as there are enough in the channel s catalog that people will fork over     for that these vanity shows get greenlit. maybe if enough people cancel their subscriptions and cite these shows  showrunners and actors attitudes as why  then the companies will tet back to the business of business and not babysitting woketivists. hopefully  future employers will remember that these people prefer wasting their bosses money to troll customers.
creating videos to criticize youtubers is alright when you are a youtuber yourself. not necessarily when its a multimillion production.
they intentionally wrote garbage.would you hire these people for anything its like a restaurant intentionally serving garbage to its customers as a screw-you to its customers.
I think rock saved the dccu with black adam.rotten tomatoes is the exact opposite of she hulk.critics 40   audience 90 .its pathetic how blatant media is just trying to tell people what to watch and think instead of honestly reviewing
gao   that really tickled me because the little troll that lives inside of me really loves trolling the trolls  ...pepper   its a bold strategy cotton  lets see if it pays off for em  ... https   www.youtube.com watch v 9hvejeb5uvk
I dont see a point in making a show predicated against the  internet trolls   where it makes the show terrible for everyone else as well.
they did own everyone who was stupid enough to watch this after watching the trailer. good political spin on explaining away their ineptitude.
what do you expect from people that acknowledge that they themselves cant write a good story  its equal to expect garbage are smell so bad
so we re at the point that we re putting critics in our stories so the characters can beat them up  this is literally some shit fourth graders do lmfao
thats a interesting excuse.
I heard black adam is actually a fun movie to watch  and apparently it doesnt try to sneak a political message. not great  but a good movie.marvel thought they were untouchable Gods.  dc knows they are here to make entertainment. you know what  maybe its time for dc to eat marvel s lunch. after all   marvel hates their customers.marvel you made your bed  now sleep in it.
I cannot believe that any writer and or actor would actually want to put out a pile of stinking poo. I followed her first series from start to finish and she was so great in that. and the comment about not accepting female super heroes  really  gal gadot was accepted  scarlett johannsson was accepted  the first wonder woman in the 70 s was accepted for crying out loud!!! that comment is a slap in the face.
I wish they admitted they had no ideas at all and just wing it episode to episode.
Imean  wouldn t it be better to disprove the critics by providing a superior show  why would you purposefully make it trash
not subscribing to disney  and keeping my money from them is like a f  k-you and I love that.   so much resistance to a woman just existing in the space of superheroes ... what rock did they find these people under
there is not  so much resistance to a woman just existing in thatspace of superheroes.  there s resistance when the execution is poor or middling  and virtually no resistance when the execution is strong  such as the first wonder woman movie  series like jessica jones on netflix and stargirl on the cw  or characters like black widow  wanda  gamora  sif  and the wasp in earlier mcu movies . there s also been resistance to movies like man of steel  batman v. superman  of which wonder woman is generally considered the best part   justice league  morbius  the ben affleck daredevil movie  superman iiI  superman iv  the quest for peace  batman   robin  x-men origins  wolverine  the iron fist series on netflix  the first hulk movie  and so on. some people really did not like iron man 3 and were not shy about saying so.comic book fans were enjoying stories with and about superheroines decades ago. was there room for improvement  of course. but take a look at  80s marvel  especially the team books  and you ll see a lot of great female superheroes  sometimes in leadership positions.also  yeah -- by far my most-viewed post on my fledgling substack is my critique of she-hulk.
ummm bounding into comics is kinda sus though. like if you cross check a lot of their articles it turns out to be bullshit
they basically admitted to wasting studio funds.. disney being all about the money isn t going to be happy about thag
disney is so thin skinned they take constructive criticism as an attack no one watched or liked she-hulk the only people who did are the woke feminists  and they cant seem to understand that the reason their target audience to watch the show dont cause they attack and hate on them every chance they get and it baffles me.
yeah and Im a shitty dad on purpose....
imagine a marvel director actually being edgy. just the slightest bit. for example  have a white man be replaced by another white man  and he comments   oh  it doesnt have to be a woman or a black guy this time  did hr fall asleep   you know  just one time make fun of the pc agenda everyone can see but cant talk about - a situation that just begs to be made fun of.
but of course they re saying this. far be it from them to admit that they done goofed and to take responsibility for it. I knew from the start it was a woke hot garbage power grab masquerading as a series from the moment I watched the trailers earlier this year  and being perceptive is not  trolling.  funny how the creators of these shows always conveniently forget to make their characters likable and well written so that they can justify complaining and trash talking just to drum up publicity for their vanity projects. sad  isn t it
they  made doomcock the villain he would like to thank them for the 8 000 more followers they cant write and call it a comedy  is sad if they had stuck with the story that was already there their ending was so bad they wrote themselves into a corner
I wonder how mcu executives feel about sinking millions of dollars into a bad low quality troll
this show has only made the friday night crew richer while bankrupting marvel.
the first wonder woman movie did well but the 2nd did not. black widow was very popular in marvel phase 1-3 movies  but her own movie in phase 4 did poorly. captain marvel movie did very well because it was the movie before endgame came out  but people didn t like the actress. its not sexism or misogyny  its the writing  quality of show or movie  and the actress that determines whether or not a female superhero is popular or not.
well jokes on them  because I liked it. you know Im kinda a misogynist myself  and after I saw how much this show just destroyed the credibility and integrity of women  I knew this is for me.
why would they do that just stab themselves in the back hahah
hearingtatiana maslany willingly participating in a project to make a  bad product  negates any statements Ive heard thatshe s a talented actress.  I haven t knowingly seen anything she s been in.  now  I ll actively not watch anything she has a major role in.  to admittedly target the demographic who will absolutely trash the show youre creating good or bad is such a bad move!  but  to make it intentionally bad  and supposedly tailor the script and plot to predict reactions in order to come up with their  sick burns  ahead of time   some of the reactions probably are predictable  but some of the harshest Ive seen couldn t be predicted because those writers creators  minds dont work the way the most vicious critics  do.  critical drinker is a good example.  he s off the wall!  I love it! the best revenge is to live a good and successful life.   want to get back at the worst critics   you should have made the best  most bulletproof show you could.  how petty are the creative team to want to make an  intentionally bad show  to play to their own egos k.e.v.i.n. s assertion that  marvel only perfectly crafts its products...    before  she-hulk   thats been proven untrue.   eternals   thor  love and thunder  intentionally sending a self-serving  eff you  to the demographic is pretty pathetic.  Imean you targeted the guys you loathe because... guys and the patriarchy    purposefully  making a bad show was spectacularly done with the last episode!  I know these other content creators have said this  but the irony of jen walking into court and telling the reporter that people need to take responsibility for their actions is staggering!  now  the creative team  and I use that term loosely throughout this comment  seem to do so.  Im just not sure they know what the consequences of their actions will ultimately be.  like not being hired after  she-hulk  is done for anything other than another misandrist project   the  woke movement  is returning to a sleeping state  which is probably better for them.  although  the real world and not the fantasy world is probably more of a nightmare to them  but is a passable normal for the rest of us.
I think thay give up on the fans just right for  social equity score.  bank loans. Imay have forgotten name of the score
the fact that they wrote in a doomcock  overLord dvd  character to  own  is rather petty and childish
pretty feeble attempt at damage control. if what the show s creators are saying is true  and I doubt it   they spent nearly 3 years and millions of dollars to make the show what it is simply to get back at the youtubers podcasters they somehow knew would  rightfully  call out the show for what it is  absolute garbage. essentially they re saying they created this show out of spite. so what does thatsay about the show s creators  not much.and really  who comes out the winner in all this  the show s creators who are claiming they created the show to  troll the trolls   or the aforementioned youtubers podcasters who spent next to nothing  apart from their sanity  watching and criticizing these shows  what baffles me is that the film and television industry is notoriously tight with a buck. they ll squeeze a quarter till the eagle screams. yet they seem to be giving free rein  and millions of dollars  to a bunch of inexperienced  untalented hacks  letting them create whatever they want whether itsells or not.  and historically it does not sell
I haven t watched the show because of the trailer and disney attacking fans. and I am encouraged not to watch anything new with she-hulk since I have a bad immage of her now. let s assume there s more like me  was it worth it
I need to add something important here...I stopped watching your show at episode 5 ! thats all I lasted.  your show was unwatchable.lets just say its true....how does this work to promote any future projects these people create   its seems a very career killing move to me. so no I dont buy their little lie here not at all. they just sucked at making shows and determining what marvel audiences wanted to see. their shows would have been better off in late 90 s or early 2000 s prime time but frankly ally mcbeal would have steam rolled them in the ratings and they wouldn t have lasted 5 episodes
marvel gave one of their most popular solo female characters to a group of hacks who then trashed the ip for the foreseeable future.
the critics are hate watching it  so their followers wouldn t have to. I d rather watch a cynical review of a pile of dung than the pile itself.
honestly she-hulk was never going to be a good show. we must all admitshe-hulk is quite derivative of the hulk. so the fact that the hulk has had some of the worst storylines in the mcu shows us that making another show about a hulk wasn t going to be a good idea. honestly  we should have all realized though when edward norton refused to come back and play the character.
we made a bad show! take that  manbabies!
how about instead of  trolling the trolls   you make a show worth a damn for the vast majority who wanted to see the character come to life
right.. she wanted to ruin her career.
yes but I only supported the she hulk comics because Im a disgusting toxic male with a deviant sick fetish for muscular green women. Im glad this show exists to let me know what a freak I am. although I cant watch this show as it wasn t made for the scourge of society like myself. thank you marvel  thank you jessica gao  thank you kevin feige. oh and in case you couldn t tell I was being sarcastic.marge  well duh.
really dont get where this idea that female lead characters are not welcome by male viewers readers and that there s some sort of resistance to them  . this line of thinking is utter bollocks  Im pretty sure that most male readers love to read about and watch female leads. female characters are amongst my very favourites - wonder woman  she-hulk  hawkwoman  black widow  I could go on. creators just need to create good books comics films tv series of these characters  not rocket science really.
they played themselves
1. dont feed the trolls.   internet 1012. looking at the vast amount of people who could have comprised the audience that would have watched this it amazes me  and that is not easy  thatso much money  time  effort  etc etc was dedicated to a delusional move to  get back at the man .  that audience has zero to do with the people living in their heads as boogey men.3. marvel has jumped the shark. when this is all over expect an entire lame but wrong excuse that all this was part of the  multiverse  and they try to sweep it all under the rug with that excuse.
the saddest thing is that you cantell they tried so hard to make a deadpool clone with she hulk but she s just annoying asf  anyways the hype for deadpool 3 is real though cant wait to see hugh jackman return as wolverine
if any part of this debacle was deliberate the only possible endgame is to make feminism itself so cringe thatsociety turns away from it - reversing the trend that has made female fertility so unfashionable that we are facing population collapse  and solve the demographic imbalance by getting back to making babies
the show is for leftover women  by leftover women and for leftover women. this behavior is the mid-30s equivalent of the japanese eight grader syndrome.
does anyone else turn the volume right down
Im not sure if youre just being overly-nice by not pointing it out  but that picture of the writer s room for she hulk is exactly what I d expect.  not a writer over the age of 23  diverse for diversity-sakes  not because they earned the job  and literally one male writer in the room who s clearly flamboyant as all hell.  not that his sexual preference is an issue.  its really not.  but the fact that this  progressive  group of woman dare let this poor little dude think he s anything more than a face in the room to stay legally inclusive both makes really sad and also cackle hysterically at the same time.
lolol we made a bad show and the critics hated it just like we predicted!! hahahaha!!  I dont get it  what is the strategy here  lol
its hilarious that they brag so much about predicting the same reaction that the industry has been deliberately provoking and exploiting for years. such big brain. reminds me of when feminists provoke men to a breaking point only to then go  typical male aggression . its a low effort copout that belies immaturity  not wit. also if they really did predict the obvious backlash thatsuggests that all the twitter drama was completely performative which still paints them as haughty  manipulative and shitty people rather than some kind of intellectual superior.also people were begging for a black widow movie during phase 2 so its not like fans hate women. we only got one after the character stopped being relevant and even then it was a mediocre in its execution.its not the characters  its the delivery.
what would happen if a man a wrote a poorly written female character  it would definitely be trolling the woke mob.
they lit themselves on fire to prove a point oh boy  I feel so burnt.
there s a huge difference between taking a laugh at your own writing and intentionally doing it wrong.Imiss when you dont include the Bible passage  at the end of your videos.
that response column is extraordinarily self absorbed  dream on! whose reality are they inhabiting  who are they making the show for  they are living a dream world unreality of their own imaginations  reality will hit them hard when they wake up.
women cant exist in this space without criticism!  no. badly written women cant exist in this space without criticism. and sadly there s a lot of them because of the stupid ideas they come up with for women  like this show. its supposed to be a comedy... no reason it couldn t have been a superhero show that had occasional laughs  but fair enough. it was terrible  humor   though. and never make episodes where you attack the audience  regardless what they do. that is not a good idea as it will get them to go after you that much more. write a good show  and they d have nothing to say. you wrote the same old crap you usually do that people dont want  and have the audacity to call your detractors  unoriginal   if  every time you put the same kind of junk onto the screen  you get the same criticism  the problem is you.
the irony being that male fans popularized shehulk comics to begin with. you think a hot sassy green chick with giant busoms was made for women    I wasn t alive in the 80 s  but just a shot in the dark  no.  they are doing a great job at pushing away the core demographic that would actually watch this show if done well.
its on purpose because they couldn t write a good show if they tried they just have so many layers of cope to never have to even acknowledge that they might have created a terrible show.  who are these shows for I cant imagine making stuff for feminists or other hate groups is very profitable unless the people making reviews drive enough viewership to keep them going idk.
the problem with self-inserts becomes an issue when self is a loser.  who want s to watch the show  super-loser    male or female  thats irrelevant.
as a fan but more importantly an individual who appreciates good writing and story-telling  I stopped after two episodes. I am not a critic but I hate the  bs  excuse we meant to be bad  she should be fired. how about do something  I dont know good
nice takes melmac.  this is like when that unfunny hack hannah gadsby had thatspecial which wasn t even comedy  just a bunch of rants and a lifestory.   when everyone realized  the pr became  you didn t get it  that was meant to be the actual joke .just like the kid who gets crappy marks on an assignment and boasts about putting no time or effort into it - it fools no one.
that is sad. here s a privilege handed over to someone to head a writing team and the opportunity to demonstrate how women can be great at a traditionaly male dominated industry. and thats all they could do  what a waste of opportunity  cant believe they re proud of what they did.
lol  they could predict what trolls would say because said trolls have only ever existed in their imaginations. thats why they consistently fight against straw men to deflect real criticism.
this is getting boring now. every time someone says they dont like a female lead film  they are automatically sexist. it does not matter if those same people like other female fronted films  and also dislike some male fronted films as well  just so long as they dislike one female fronted film  they are sexist.there was a post by paul feig crying that his ghostbusters film not being included in the boxset  and some female twitterist posted this shit  2016 ghostbusters is excellent. people who try and argue that itshouldn t be included as its not canon... are sure using a lot of words for  Im sexist . my reply was  so people cant use personal taste or reason without being accused of sexism  attitudes like this are not helping your cause.the 2016 film was bad  despite having a mostly great cast. and it is not canon. I would not want the remake in a friday 13th box either. is thatsexist too as I pointed out  the remakes of popular franchise films like friday 13th or nightmare on elm street  for instance  do not get included in boxsets as they are not canon  so why should gb 2016 be included in a boxset where the three movies are all the same canon  do people cry that mcu boxsets do not include ghost rider  captain america  1991   the punisher or any fantastic four films I will be honest and say that I love the mcu films but find the tv shows weak. agents of shield started ok  but went downhill. the netflix shows were mostly crap except daredevil. dont even start me on inhumans. and finally the disney  shows have been ok at best  poor at worst  with the exception of hawkeye and moon knight  but even I understand why some people might not like either of those as well.I had high hopes for she-hulk  but it was an absolute shitstorm of bad writing. the characterisations of the abomination  wrecking crew   titania were awful  although roth s performance was one of the standouts of the show  itstill ruined the character . the cgI was poor  with pretty much all the money spent on bruce because you dont put a big mcu movie character in a tv show then give him shit cgI too.the fact the main villain was such a let down  and the biggest draw for most people was the return of daredevil kinda shows you where they fucked up.I like most of the mcu movies  but for me the weakest ones have tended to be more recent. eternals is barely watchable for me. I was never a fan of the characters in the comics  so that did not help  but they moved so far from the original concept that it might as well have been a specifically created for hollywood bunch of characters  ticking every box for the sake of it.captain marvel was weak as well  but is at least watchable. the biggest problem with it is the character was too powerful  nothing to do with women as I also never liked superman while reading comics for the same reason   and I really did not like the acting. they also turned fury into a joke.thor darkworld was pretty meh  and that is a male lead film of a character I like in every other appearance  with an actor I really like.black widow is low on  my list too  but part of that is because it came way too late in the franchise  and I dont think the character was given the respect she deserved as she was just used as a stepping stone to launch the new black widow. shame as the cast were all brilliant in it  but the story was not great. I can easily watch it again and again  but not to the same degree as most mcu films.the problem is though as soon as you say you dont like a female fronted film  you are sexist. if the main character is black or chinese  you are racist. if some of the characters are gay  you are homophobic. it does not matter that I also dislike films starring straight white men as well.quality is what matters in a film or tv show  not what someones gender  sexual orientation or race is.
we spent millions of investors money to troll people we dont like! that is a business model I hope they stick to.
believe it or not  the excuse they give is technically an actual school of thought in performance art. and I fucking hate it.its called  dadaism.  dadaism is was a philosophy of performative arts that basically means that one can get their message out or  in the cases of those that created the philosophy  spread their communist message by creating a purposefully bad product. this was the excuse they made in order to push their idea as something  revolutionary. in reality  this school of thought is so stupidly backwards and up itself  that its spine is a literal knot. quite honestly  its not some  revolutionary  concept  but rather more an excuse to use a poorly made form of entertainment to push their message. conservative  liberal  libertarian and even some communist creatives considered this a truly idiotic excuse for their carelessness.the best way to get the message you want out is to make sure that the story  world  characters  writing  logic and creative twists are all air-tight and given extra aplomb to ensure the audience can enjoy themselves and even give the idea your pushing any consideration.
so Im male and shocker dont like the mcu  come on the movies are terrible from a writing point of view. so the hulk writers thought it would be clever to completely alienated potential audiences by making a complete rubbish show. sorry the comments aren t toxic  they are simply reactions to a poorly written show made by people who appear to have no life experience to base their characters on. and sorry if you cant write court room scenes  then resign and get a writer in who can do that. the studio just flushed millions by allowing toxic self indulgent writers to show they have no talent. the shareholders must be delighted by this.
start a petition to have them all fired and have more competent team redo the show.
Im almost starting to think that people like you are in cahoots with disney and the wokey mcwoker people. you get paid more  when d sucks. but to be honest  if she hulk was the shit! like itshowed her played basketball  or football  or surfing  or fucking frisbee golf! if they showed her doing normal things that a 2022 girl would do if she  out of no where got the powers of a God  I d probably still watch your videos talking about how cool it is! we just want to see some people who love what they re doing  make movies and shows. not people who are like  yeah  fuck them  we ll show them!
same. if anything  making a bad show on purpose is worse than making a bad show on accident
I thought the comic was poorly written in the first place. so  I was not expecting much from the show.
so I understand this is the purpose of your channel but Im kinda getting tired of hearing about this green thing  Imiss gaming stuff. there s no reactions to recent trailer  shorts  anything really gaming related. this channel bled over to your other one and guess who was the topic  this damn green thing  will we ever get gaming stuff back I need a break from this  its just becoming blah  for myself. I know its your channel and you ll do as you please but as a viewer Ive had enough of this buff green bean. I apologize for making this kind of statement  I just miss gaming mac thats all.
lol ok.  yeah their investors must be having a good laugh too right
I call bs on that admission... marvel is a business  they aren t going to dump a bunch of money into a purposely bad show just to trigger a bunch of youtubers...more likely its them trying to cover for failing completely at their job of making a decent show out of a popular character....
they really made a whole series and wasted millions of dollars and that was the entire vision for the show. Jesus Christ
they may have been going for the  its so bad its good  but she hulk was so bad its bad
tatiana maslany best waifu
Ive never heard of failing to impress to er....impress.
they wasted an entire season just to take a personal jab at  trolls  on the internet  I dont think thats how trolling works jessica.
your hair looks nice in this video
with quality excuse are you sure they were all getting  canned  soon
how long until the amazon writers make the same claims about rings of power   goodness people in the industry are such liers these days.
gao may have been able to sit in her little room by herself and laugh at her own  genius  abt  trolling the trolls   or whatever  but 20 yrs from now her show is going to still be bad  and no one is going to care abt her biased  self-destructive actions.
never ascribe to malice that which can be explained by stupidity.  the show just stank and so they now say they did it deliberately.  the writing is so poor they aren t clever enough to arrange this from the beginning and it isn t an own.  just shows the dishonesty of them all.
yeah because thats a goog excuse.  haha guys I was just trolling. Im not completely inept  I wasted all this money on purpose.
pov  you tried to disguise ridiculousness as comedy...... and got caught.
what s is that accent  not a dog. just legit curious. I have not heard someone say channel like that. solid info. the show did seem to lose sight of quality for trolling. not sure why there was not more oversight. who thought this was going to be a good idea
in essence.  they wasted money and everyone s time.    how do they still have a job
then itshould be funny  right  like a spoof  did it work that way
so instead of making a good product to prove that they can make a good show  they decided to make itshit on purpose.....ok  then
not a hater but no one gonna talk about how she said kevin fiege
saying it was bad on purpose would imply they were ever capable of making this a good show. they weren t. they are horrible writers that know nothing about the source material known nothing about the law and have no idea how to write a character without making them a self insert.it may have been bad in this way on purpose but whatever this team was gonna churn out was gonna be shit.  this wording implies they were fully capable of making a great show and just decided not too
mel is bae
sounds like reverse psychology.   lol.  yeah right.  Im sure thats why they made the show.
what else are you going to say when you are a complete failure.  I did it on purpose  so I really was successful if you think about . child like logic right there.
imagine being so petty you dedicated millions of dollars to spite people online. and at the same time  because its so terrible  those same people you want to spite just get more content out of it and so you help them make more money.
on what purpose
hmm I guess amazon should just take this stance with tlotr dumpster fire aswell.
why would you want to make a bad show on purpose
these people will never be hired again in any serious capacity.
so they were only pretending to be incompetent  could ve fooled me...
I hate this to no end.some people do indeed love to say bad things for sport. but others have concerns.but apparently they just dont care about aking money at all. this is not the way to do it.
if it was supposed to be bad. why are they whine and blame fans for not liking it then  they should know no one is gonna like bad show  intended or not.
they cant admit they made a horrible series without making excuses for a bad director period!! now they saying its on purpose to cover up their failure. meanwhile black adam is action packed comic book movie and will expose where marvel is lacking
fionahulk
expensive way to troll trolls  I bet disney loves that.
I dont understand where these people are coming from. they had the money and a well liked comic book character. they were given a big opportunity to do something great  and they did this instead. they became the clowns on a stage and  got paid.  but made a mockery of all female actors that want to be taken seriously. female actors that want to take on big characters rolls and actually make something amazing.also  why are so many different projects attacking their fandom lately. dont they want the fans to buy their product  are they trying to bankrupt their ips for tax purposes
holy shit....I was actually right....I literally said this weeks ago...I cant believe it....
the villain looked like doomcock
lol   even if people are hate watching  . except we weren t.  I didn t watch any of it other than youtuber videos mocking it
so they failed as storytellers and trolls. winning
you are so beautiful without makeup. just saying....
how about the scarlet witch  that we call mommy !! hmmm what about her
birthing person  .  does it really surprise anyone how childish and spiteful these woke people are   remember people.  these are the same people who are censoring others on twitter on a daily basis.  but hey.  just like one of the  she-hulk  actresses said... atleast their getting paid   right
she hulk was created to trigger the critics  - so you gave the critics the power  its more of an l lol.  you allowed people you dont know to dictate your vision and decision making.
I had already given up on the mcu after endgame so I had no desire to see the show anyway  and yeah after watching this and hearing other stuff about it Im definitely not gonna bother with it!!!
you know its bad when a  legal comedy  has virtually no accuracy to an actual courtroom and zero funny moments.
they could ve just thrown that money away  same shit honestly
apathy will come soon  and they will blame men. but all they will see is the chared outlines of what once were fans pointing to this article.
well gao created pickle rick so there s that for proof that the show was going to fail. even though there are many marvel female superheroes that are written way better than she hulk hell even better than some dc shows. I would say and this is saying a lot  batwoman was written better than she hulk and thats saying a lot lol.
there is a game that is notorious for when players start to lose badly they pretend they are a troll and joined the game to just lose on purpose as if thatsomehow is better. I think the people behind this show simply suck and in their baby like ability to deal with life s problems and are now pretended they are trolling on purpose  as if that is any better. the game btw is league of legends if anyone cares.... xd
they tried to copy the she-hulk comic style  so of course they went against the grain of what makes other comic book series works. and obviously not everyone was a fan of that.
the lack of emotional intelligence in marvel  disney  and these people is staggering.they dont seem to understand that at the end of the day its about making money.get woke  go broke!
they trolled kevin feige so  . yeah Im calling bullshit on the show runners .
they triggered the audience with no trigger warning ! so inconsiderate
well I hope disney  shuts their mouths close by  making the show not canon   and writting off entirely of any upcoming mcu projects  it can still work without she hulk  nothing would change
thats a really expensive  f--k you . oh well  somebody thought the money was well spent I guess.
so sadists made this show. lol wow.
massive cope lol.
I like your usual eye makeup. why no do it today
didn t feel like doing the whole routine today and just threw up hair up and did light makeup lol
to call this hack a  writer  is a far strech.
Ive only watched a few of your videos but Ive already heard you mispronounce kevin feige and princess rhaenyra lol do you even watch this stuff  or u just covering the latest hot gossip ! either way Im here for it
the problem is for se orita gaothe trolls were all the audience because nobody likes the show thatsimple
girl I love you
calculate the ad revenue for all youtube doing vids on how bad.
this is such a bad excuse for this show. they basically proved that people wont watch garbage.
if they are being negative  they are paying attention  - said the woman who spent tens of millions to get back at some youtube comments.
so you are saying actually genuine criticism lives in their heads rent free we are playing them like a fiddle
makes a show with the sole purpose of making fans angry  call fans every name under the sun because they get angry and the show bombs... entitled karen logic 1 0 1.
so they wasted millions of dollars in order to attack critics    a twit is free!!!
she intentionally made a bad show to antagonize critics whose job is to review shows... uh  why not just make a good show  do you know the mental gymnastics she had to jump through to sit in a room and say out loud.  let s make a shitshow that will make me and marvel as a whole look bad. what s that  make a good show  why would I do that
chasing status and fame rather than building something is unsatisfying in the end. granted watching what you built get destroyed is also horrendously painful
trolling the trolls  says only someone that doesnt understand what a troll is
so  they wanted to  troll the trolls  by making a show about one of the most popular and beloved female heroes in the mcu intentionally horrible to spite the critics who hold the same beliefs held by the majority of the entire audience!  meaning they dont care that they intentionally ruined a potentially awesome show for millions of fans!  such garbage human trash!
so  congratulations for the successes of making a show to troll the trollswhy aren t they happy then  even doomcock is happy about the free advertising.
good God! you look that hot without all the make up ! marry me
they predicted it  hhahahahaahahaha
there s a she hulk show!
anything to avoid admitting they are talentless  d  d
there a lot of hypocrisy in this writing team. we wanna make a strong femal hero show... but we also wanna make it God awful on purpose to own the trolls  theres alot of conflicting bs.
well then  I didn t watch it on purpose. wow they spent millions to try and own the trolls. I think they tired their best and did such a bad job are now making excuses.
I want that kind of money
I dont watch disney. I prefer to watch youtubers trashing disney.
sooooooooooo they wanna tell me that they deliberately wasted approximately 25 million dollars per episode  putting she hulks 6 episodes on 150 million dollars in total  and put yet another project on the badly mistreated and overworked special effect artists  to make their little revenge porn fantasy reality to satisfy the little troll inside of them  you purposefully wasted 150 million dollars by apparently knowingly writing a bad show that was meant to piss people off so you can have their fun playing victim  somebody hold me back  with this level of petty entitlement Im gonna turn into an actual she-hulk and somehow I have the feeling people would  accept me in thatspace  very well  now wouldn t they
I liked this show  but it didn t improve with each passing episode. the pseudo villian was dumb in so many creative levels and the 4th breaking wall ending was attrocious. usually series improve with each episode  but there s a bad spiral here.it had potential because the character faced challenges grounded with the premise and the story was fun and well paced... but the drop in quality in the last episodes was too much.
so are we the trolls or are they the trolls I cant tell anymore
so they spend money  to make little to none in return  but it was all in an effort to just piss people off...is this now how business works  make a product intentionally bad  just to waste investor money  and make people mad.if anything they are only going to make their investors mad  and the investors aren t going to invest any money in the future in anything they may want to do.
so they could of made a show that was good and opted out of it to prove a point  oh ok
so they wasted a ton of time  money and effort just to be trolls. thatshould blacklist them from any other work. no one would be able to take them seriously after that admission.
preemptive shitshow strike... they knew it was trash
doomcock
no  I know it was not bad on purpose because it was actually bad. if they were trying to make a bad show then it would probably be good based on their backward beliefs.
by making she-hulk bad on purpose  aren t they losing money and viewership  I dont see marvel recovering from this
season 2 will be woke-hulk killing the hulk.
guess she forgot about ratings and making a profit.
amazing that disney has to much money to waste to create a show that alienates its target audience. most ladies I know aren t followers fo she hulk.
you dont understand  I was only pretending to be incompetent.
so this movie was made to alienate your main demographic  smart move marvel...
subbed!  go boom!
of course it was bad on purpose from day one. you cantell.
welcome to woke people. they dont create out of joy. they dont create out of passion. they dont create out of love.they create hate. its what they want. by their own admission. they admitted the show was a self insert kind of show. they admitted they didn t have the talent to make the show everyone wanted them to make. and now they admitted that the show was deliberately made to make people hate it. truly evil people. I hope they get help.
or instead of lying to try and put yourself above the people that you hate after your show created with the intention to put yourself above the people that you hate failed... this is crazy  but hear me out... you could have made a good show that everyone likes  then everyone wins and the people you hate are proven wrong  so you win twice.
hey. if they love trolling the trolls  then gloves off. I did not watch the show  but when I seen the end part I was shocked. the writers room was filled with  by far  the ugliest consortium of human beings I have ever seen. quasimodo would look like a model when surrounded by this throng.
they make no sense not even a recovery   yep they make shows tank just to get back at critics. rename it trolling themselves. firstly they cried no one liked it and  called audiences sexist racist ect now they said it was on purpose to troll the critics.    hollywood done gone from stupid hypocrites to just plain dumb.
they are really eager to hurt the mcu brand name aren t they.
I hope they never get another job in hollywood again. that ll show us fans for sure. that  or disney marvel can be the next g4tv.  disney  owes us fans an apology now
so thay making  it bad on porpose  not realy want to be making the real bucks on ther fans ..  ohhh great ide that one isint it
mcu fans  disney   subscribers  trollsbtw his name is kevin feige  pronounced fuy-gie
ah the old  just kidding  excuse  show is bad  so lets use the  it was bad on purpose to troll lol .  I wonder if the writers will find the same humor when marvel starts downsizing and firing people due to poor revenue  while also realizing that those same  critics  grew in viewership and where able to make a full-time job out of it.  so who really got trolled in the end
I dont mind the content  but why are we still talking about this show  lol.
the show was  bad on purpose   oh... okay.anybody else getting a flashback of pee-wee herman crash-flipping his bike  getting launched off of it and doing a  recovery  somersault  and saying    Imeant to do that      https    www.youtube.com watch v vjxu7evxs2a
oh yes  that turd was totally on purpose.
why admit to such a things publicly  even to cover for a bad production  these comments taint their careers so thoroughly.
look up beneil dariush victory speech  your kind of fighter
dismissing any criticism whatsoever as trolling really isn t a good look.
what a jealous  petty and small woman she is.
projection level 1 000 000 000 000 000 000
so let me get this straight...if the writers were instead chefs at a restaurant they would serve literal shit to the customers and when a customer goes  what the hell  this is shit  they will reply with  aha! I knew you d say that! I am so meta and so clever aren t I   really stop justifying shit.
the show definitely wasn t great but I had some fun with it  the way the show treated men did suck though  a lot
funny most of what they pulled in phase 4 felt the same poorly written.  so this isn t nothing new from this  troll  creator.
or maybe thats just an alibI for being so incompetent at making films and movies.
looks like someone is replying to comments using your profile posing as you. I have one on each of my comments from 3 days ago
well I guess they sure showed us trolls a thing or two. show was so bad its not getting a season 2. lmao.
I swear this better not be canon after all this stupid stuff they have thrown in  please gosh dont have it be canon.
so they made this show to lose money
loved the she hulk comics but the show was so depressingly disappointing
melanie  marry me! youre so gorgeous!
they basically admit people who like the show actually love shit. lol
are they really falling back on the  we meant to do that  excuse   as bad as thatshow was  I shouldn t be surprised.imagine tanking your own show  ruining yet another beloved female character  pretty much killing the potential for a new franchise  further hurting marvel and disney s reputation  all on someone else s dime... on purpose... to  get back at internet trolls.   and couldn t even do that right.  what was supposed to be a comedy turned out to be the same old bitter  hypocritical projecting we ve gotten well and truly sick of in the recent years.  why do  modern day  feminists hate women so much   seriously - actual misogynists show women more respect.
I d like to live rent free. but not in a marvel star s head. no telling what vile stuff I d find there. plus there s very little room. one would think there would be so much room that there would be an echo  but no. its cramped because of small mindedness.
series existed just to waste everyone s time  and to flex  we are disney! we love to waste money  and we dont care who we hire to write direct bc you ll eat it all up!
soo instead of making a quality product with good story telling  interesting relatable characters  and gripping situations that pull the audience into that world they instead thought  hey! let s literally waste millions of dollars to  troll the trolls  not like its our money lolz!as obviously this was thee best way to show  them  that they were exactly as woke and devoid of any actual talent  yeeeeeah  cause thats how you prove your critics wrong  by doing exactly what their criticism of you are  got em!
they say that now because the show is just bad
that is a really expensive joke to play on anyone...
I took a poop and predicted that trolls and haters would say itstunk....and they did!!!  Im brilliant and can predict the future....hire me k.e.v.i.n
if the show purposely written as bad  thus she hulk broke the 4th wall just to change it  then all of her story in it were meaningless . I really dont know how on earth this rubbish got approval from feige and marvel during the pitch
ok  gimme a break.
using that much money just to piss off some people is probably one of the dumbest strategies Ive ever seen. kevin needs to leave and make way for someone who knows what they re doing and care about the products we re paying for.
the  trolls    in the dullest most sarcastic tone they can manage   no. please. stop.
they sure showed us huh the villain of this show is jessica gao with her self insertsthe misogyny from marvel
so they purposely sucked at writing  that is bs.
by all means waste tens of millions of dollars on a tv show that everybody s going to be angry about.  what a brilliant f     self own.  I know I know its easier to make a tv show than to give that money to somebody that actually needs it. with all the money they spent on that tv show they could have at least helped some families out.
Im not paying for disney  but I do have it. imma watch the shows regardless. I ll wait for the disappointment after the show. Im not looking for signs of wokeness  just want to b entertained. if Im not entertained  on to the next. thats it. no need to bash them on social media. I get y but I dont care bcuz ik when something isn t good  I dont need someone else to tell me so. the episode when she said she cantake anything bcuz of what ppl say about her being a lawyer  like women cant b lawyers. I felt that bcuz man feel like certain jobs are only for men not women but itshouldn t b that way. if your qualified  gender shouldn t matter. I didn t c that as woke. there s not a lot of female lawyers  miners  or construction workers. most of them want to be a nurse or behind a desk  secretary . ik a lot females who dont care for sports.
if it was bad intentionally  why did they have to drag daredevil through that mess
why oh why are investors financing this rubbish  now the actors  directors etc are coming out saying this was made to piss off an audience i.e the source of revenues and profits from these projects. investors now need to sue the actors  directors and producers for the deliberate or negligent use of investor funds to produce something they know would not generate a profit.
well its their money to waste
good use of disney funds.
if the show was horrendous on purposethen what s the purpose to give them money
so much resistance to a woman being in a super hero...I didnt hear anyone complain about pepper pots showing up in her own suit in the battle...it makes sense that tony would have wanted her to be protected.. other female heros dont make sense.
this girl is smart and hot.  damn!  that is definitely refreshing to see that.
sounds like an expensive trigger. are they sure the joke is on the critics maybe let these people trigger critics to their bankruptcy
when they target is they re playing directly into our hands  honey you are projecting.
opening jobs better than the president....   yes.   one of three best comments!
hahahaha they will do or say anything hahahahaha
I doubt they predicted the level of criticism... and all they do get they try to blame on it being a female hero.  I think they are just clueless in their own little bubble  and think the show is good and barely had anything they considered trolling in it.
so... they made garbage... so they are one-upping the people saying marvel is making garbage... by making more garbage
I dont hate the show....its much worse than that. I just dont care about these shows.  they completely lost me a while ago. I dont care about whatever shiz show they do. Im never spending another second on them.I get my enjoyment now by watching these shows get shredded.
I hope that every single comic fan boycotts all things marvel. you d think they would ve learned this lesson from how batwoman turned out
she hulk in this show ain t even a super hero. she saves no one  is only out for herself and just hoed her self around. if anything this should be a manual for  what women shouldn t do .  if you ever wonder why less and less men are getting married or even taking part in the dating scene.  its cause of women like this on this show and that wrote this show. there wasn t one empowered women in this show.  just a bunch of damaged goods that blame men for everything.
that is a lot of money to spend to troll creators on youtube.  at what point does management not see this   do they like wasting money
hahahahah this is some crazy strategy - make a bad show and also say its bad in order to nulify the voices of all the people saying it. are they  trying to invent a new genre - making bad movies on purpose
so it was a comic book show made by people that dont like or understand the comic genre in order to alienate anyone that might watch it. if they wanted to parody the comic genre they should have looked at ryan reynold s deadpool.
what canthey say at this point  it was a poorly written dull  depressing mess. Imeant to make it bad  a grown up somewhere should be taking charge. we are trying to produce products that people want to consume. not some sort of personal vanity piece. I dont know that I even believe this. it does seem like a weak rewrite of reality which is kind of ironic  to make the writers feel better about the dreck they have produced.
check the next witcher in netflix doing the woke s  t as well
marvel fans  she-hulk sucks!  marvel   we know. we made itsuck on purpose. see how stupid you are      umm  okay. that does sound like female logic. lmao  jk
sound like cope to me.   they just cant accept the fact that they dont know how to write a good show.
if you believe that   you are tarded. they thought it would carry it was trash. so now they are trying to turn it around
how is this trolling  I was expecting it to be shit. at this point the quality of these series is so ridiculous that I would almost consider trolling if they wrote it well and got me interested.
how come executives or shareholders dont lose their mind both whenever their money is wasted for this kind of trash and when  authors pulls this kind of stunt.
same with velma just a massive troll that isn t funny
so they intended to lose money...yeah stupid people do stupid things. in the process they helped you and others gain followers.
slither away from the criticism all you like we know you are full of it.  man  imagine if they just tried to make a great story.  people used to do that.  people that were hired on their talent level rather than their immutable traits.
I dont believe one single word of  we were trolling the trolls . this article is just there to make an excuse for this real bad written stuff.
outro song
hate watch  more like no one watched.
nice one  better than the president... lol
this is sad..they just admit its a self insert and they could care less about the product..imagine your final villain being  the internet  this is marvel..from interdimensional beings as villains to  internet trolls ..Im almost tempted to say marvel women cant write..
wonder woman is the best!
I only watched the first episode didnt click with me
tat sounds like a piece of rainbow. why are these people being tolerated
when r u going 2b live on twitch again
so marysue-hulk is the most expensive lefty troll in history fascinating.
they literally ruined my favorite super heroine on purpose she hulk is dead pool with boobas how do you mess that up...even on purpose
so all Im hearing is  my movie is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen in my entire life. how could I have been so blind  its a self-indulgent  adolescent mess  I can barely sit through it. and now with all this hype  Ive got a real snakes on a plane brewing. critics are gonna crucify me  my career will be over before it begins. God  if youre out there  I know I dont deserve it but I need your help. please take this project away from me. make it rain. send a meteor. anything  - abed nadir  community
for regular viewers the she hulk episodes were horrible. I asked my sister and she didn t care after an episode.
cinema sociopaths
the 4 movies tv series I refuse to watch are captain marvel  wheel of time  ring of power  and she hulk. from everything I hear there s no need to waste my time.
wow .............................just pure fucking hurbis!!!!!!!!!!!
lol
no  thats just a bad cooping mechanism...  I wasn t even trying  says the guy who just rev d his engine then got gapped when the light turned green.
ok melonie  apply for the job and write something better. I ll wait..
she hulk was so bad   even though I pirated it for free  I still feel I want my money back.feel so sorry for those who paid to see this.
lost me at they had previously good shows on disney plus.. the only thing descent was the mandalorian.
hasn t  triggered  me  I just didn t watch it.
always these dunk on men  shows  ruining major ip s wtf is going on man! really burning tons of money for a  own  of us dudes!  but leave major ip s out of it please this is why anime is so major and sad anime is subject to horrid en dubs......
its call wasting money..... trolling doesnt work that way.
lol trolling the trolls by make them getting paid by all these yt videos
yeah.  marvel showed the friday night tights crew. they did this making a show they knew was crap and doubling fnt crew s views. the only thing good about marvel now is them providing independent critics things to trash in an entertaining way.
its really sexist and double standardy thatshe forces and objectified murdock when speaking with fiege.
Im trying to imagine the pitch that got the money for she-hulk. we re going to take a beloved marvel character and make her into a horrible  piece of garbage with no redeeming qualities what so ever. she ll be rude  cruel  angry  entitled  sexist  you know  just the worst. then people that review movies and tv shows will hate it and then  we ll be able to say  ha ha! we knew you wouldn t like it! and then  the money will pour in!and  disney said  yes! what a great idea!! here s millions of dollars to make a show to anger a few dozen critics! go get them! we have so much money we can afford to burn it  like literally burn it.Im checking my portfolio to make sure I have no disney stock  this organization is going down.
this is what happens when the inmates run the asylum lol so they literally wasted millions of dollars to piss people off when the trolls out there  and they will continue to make marvel dance and marvel cant help but to dance for trolls
making something bad then predicting people will recognize that its bad hardly qualifies as clairvoyance.
the foolishness of this comment is that professional critics love the show. its actual viewers that hate it. lol
I smell copium
thats an expensive joke
I love the charcter she hulk but the show was so boreing  we watch marvel to se action adventure what villen will she fight next we did not get much of that and my God how many times us straight men gonna get talked down to we have a right to like she hulk to
mmmhmm... yea..... right.  the whole  Imeant to do that  bs. lol.... nice try disney  on side stepping your failure.
thats such a stupid excuse  so the whole purpose was to waste money and make crap! okay! good job!
well I did not even watch it at all
you would think the ppl who funded this trash  would be pissed. actual criticism is not trolling. this show could have been awesome if they listened.
why just why  why make a bad show on purpose  why spend millions of dollars on cgI for a bad show  is it wrong for me to think that everyone from showrunners to writers to be blacklisted from disney so they can never ever again make an abomination  like this again
she hulk is kind of the donald trump of superheros.  got famous by being intentionally antagonistic.
sounds like an excuse
wow  that just f my brain  spending millions of dollars for trolling the trolls! genius
kinda wish everyone just decided to ignore this crap show and not even talk about it the show runners just want attention and we are giving it to them
bitter misandrist writes a self-insert...........  costs disney   millions.  excellent!
maybe heres an ideainstead of spending your time and disneys money trying to piss off the fans of your franchise you shouldve been writting and creating a great exciting funny superhero lawyer show  just a thought
so they threw away million of shareholders money just to troll youtubers  yeah those youtubers made fat stacks of cash and got a fuck ton of new followers for their cause. gj marvel! keep it up please!
what
I stopped watching after the 2nd episode. not for me...
self absorbed  muxh
see her attempt to make us mad about how bad the show was did not work. watched one episode and changed channel. not mad just did not care.
so ya set out to make a failure. congratulations  you succeeded.
copium personified.
what a gross abuse of marvel studios resources.
major cope.
what a bold lie
actors needs to stop bringing up their own personal opinions during interviews about movies.captain marvel wasn t that bad  brie larson just needed to stfu about personal opinions on politics and talk more about the movie.the comedy etc etc needs to go as well.  if I want to watch a funny movie  I ll watch a comedy.
so marvel intentionally made a bad show and lost millions just to pwn youtubers..... yeah Im calling bs
there is so much resistance against women as superheros  bro what. literally so many dope women hero s that people love. wonder woman  gamora  black widow  etc. every single person a part of she hulk just uses these lazy talking points with no substance to their claims. what a shitshow  its beyond me how ironic it is that they dont even know what a troll is.
if youre making a show that cant make back its money thats not trolling the trolls. youre just trolling yourselves
hI all I can say is munchausen by proxy
this is a lie.  its bad so  hey we made it bad on purpose!  wrong.  no one wants their show hated or terrible ratings to have their show cancelled.  this is such obvious excuse-making.
the quartering is cringe though  regardless of how lame she-hulk is.
youre not male...but remember they only love strong independent free thinking women if they agree 100  with all their ridiculous talking points.
wow  the creators of the show are so arrogant. it really backfired. Ive yet to hear anyone genuinely loving the show.
jokes on you  Im not bad at stuff Im just an asshole. how is this better
youre cute I like your tatoos
predict the trolll reaction    man is like if someone make for exemple a antI black coment online   then blacks get pissed and the persons says haa I predict the reations of the black ...
wonder woman is literally 80 years ago. anyone who had a problem with female superheroes - if they ever existed - probably died of old age already.
that comment sounds like someone s a bad loser. they thought they were the best writers ever and now their show has tanked they claim to have made it bad on purpose to save some face. this show was objectively bad  because just about everything was bad  the script  the dialogues  the 4th wall breaking  the cgI  the acting.
she hulk sure owned those white cis males
the mcu stopped being good a while ago
I actually liked the show..hahaha I dont know I guess I dont really care or notice shit. I watch all of it cuz its a universe connected. all the movies the shows its just a part of some bigger shit and thats cool to me. lol only thing I notice and Im not homophobic or anything is that in every netflix show or something there s gotta be a gay side character. lol I dont care but its every show now
I said it once and Im saying again. stop watching shows that you hate. you dont like she-hulk  dont watch it. you hate andor  dont watch it.I know its frustrating but this is a business and if no one is buying their crap  they ll eventually either correct their course  as I expect dc will do from now on  or go out of business. and if it isn t a failiure then maybe we are just not the target audience anymore.but by making something out of this crap we keep on business. they just have to say we are all homophobes or racists or whatever and with that  they justify themselves for lazy  low quality storytelling.
lol so let s try to deflect after hating on their fans that wanted a good show not a dumpster fire. Im so sick of garbage shows that I have to sift thru to find a good one. then when I find one they cancel the show because there s not enough viewership in a timely manner. I dont really watch disney plus. but netflix and hulu or hbo max seem to have this problem. let s double down on garbage shows that no one cares about. then you see one you like and find out no season 2. show canceled.
this is what s sad about the show and why it was allowed to air at all. I take zero joy in seeing a beloved comic be trashed and characterized as a  johnny come lately  woke sjw feminist with no self-awareness  an utterly nonexistent plot  and a representation of every sex and the city   kardashian   real housewife of  insert city  self-centered bozo whose entire goal is to  troll  the audience  and apparently revel in that fact  while destroying any possibility of seeing the character in any meaningful way going forward in the mcu. this was an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions. I know we re only talking about  comic book tv shows   movies   but damn it  to some people  clearly not the writers   these characters matter and we ve been waiting decades for the off-chance we might one day see said character in live action! and what do they do  do they look at the vast wealth of material at their fingertips  Imean  literally  the show could ve written itself .nope! they admit   we didn t have a clue how to write courtroom dramas   so instead  they rely only established mcu characters  but end up bastardizing them as well! the thing that really got under my skin was the writers assumption that the criticism from  trolls   ahem fans  was that it was yet another female character and thatshe just happened to be as strong if not stronger than her counterparts. but I never once read or heard anyone comment that this was the issue. the issues are the valid ones Ive already mentioned and despite the critiques given  their heads are so far up their backside  smelling their own farts that they will never see that they are the problem.
so they thought hey there isn t alot of female super heroes lets make it a shitshow and troll them.if this show was supposed to be woke then they shld have made it good. this gotta be the worst show of all super heroes.. even green lantern is better
wasting this much money to prove a point or mess with someone  hmm... not a good look.
let s say that this is true  the show was bad on porpuse  so they are admiting the supposed feminist mesage is just dumb
no batwoman was bad on purpose.
im sick of them saying that theres resistence to female leads. when there have been good female leads!!!  if ur character sucks  ur character sucks. it has nothing to do with the lead actress being a female!
ill just say this she hulk the toxic and wrong way to do a comedy ... peacmaker the perfect way to do a comedy as a tv show ... compare and then put she hulk were it bolengs in the shitter
why plan on making trash  especially on disney
yes its trash and the only people they are playing is themselves. they ll be forever linked to this failure   she-hulk . actual fans can probably make a better live-action cosplay film
its just all damage control. I liked aspects of the show but it was lazy and it did make fun of marvel s fans.
waste money
sounds like an excuse for their fuck up.
does this woman hulk thing do any saving of the world or does she just complain about men throughout
so let me get this straight  kevin.  you paid people a crapton of money to wreck an ip that your parent company paid a serious crapton of money for   and they did this with the express purpose of driving off the people who have spent money on the ip   and then they hammered you too like a dropkick chihuahua   what the everloving fubar are you doing   and why the snafu are any of you all getting paid at all
Ive never heard such a bunch of bullshit.  we set out to make a bad show just to troll the trolls.  she should by all rights never be hired again if she s admitting she set out to make a crappy show.
youre so pretty.
marvel just has too much money to fuck around. lol
I noticed your channel and disparu because of this garbage show  so yes  congrats to the writters for digging their own hole and call it a win
they made she hulk shitty on purpose. yea  sure  thats why itsucked. what an awful excuse for making a good character impossible to watch.
so  by providing crappy content  thereby gifting you with content  upon which you and others like you  produce multiple videos  which results in views and subs  this is considered trolling you  trolls . that was the plan  huh
yes well sadly this is marvel movies going forward. more bad stupid woke feminist writing! oh and also sub and like melonie mac she s awesome! go boom!
there was no predictions of  how the trolls would respond .all they did was state fact. its not prescient or entertaining.
wow.  bad on purpose.  thats sheer moneymaking genius.  wait  dont bad shows not make very much money...so..what s the investment here   well  shareholder person  you see  we re owning the trolls.  the trolls   they pay us money to own them   no  they dont pay us anything.  most of them dont watch the show.  ok  so where do we make money off of them   well  we dont  see.  we make them mad.  we make them mad by our show  that they dont watch  losing money   yes!   this is basically a giant jar of cope being shaken over a gaping mouth at this point.
really !  they expect people to believe this   they didn t make this show to make money  instead they wanted to lose money  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
the only thing holding she-hulk is the title of marvel studios. if she-hulk wasn t a marvel studio property  it wouldn t get anyone s attention. worse show mcu to date.
well ...  isn t that convenient thats gonna look good on your resume   I threw away a ton of disney s money to troll a few youtubers.  do youreally think thats better than simply admitting that you cant write
in other words its self-indulgent garbage. got it. so we re supposed to believe going forward that any bad writing by cheap hacks is just them being clever  or orrr you could just write a good show.
good I hope they keep wasting money making terrible shows
show is bad  on a mechanical level  I d prefer we just let it die and stop talking about it.the story of the show and the individual episodes are just badly conveyed  and made in a way that it fails to entertain.
can it get any dumber
cant trigger me I never watched it and I can watch it for free because I sail the seven seas its truly trash and atrocious.
if we do not want female superheroes then why is it half of the x-men are all women. why are the fan favorites women think about itstorm jean those are fan favorites mystique amazing and she s a villain maybe what we dont want is on inspire riding maybe we think we are worth a actual plot and story
but why  what does any of this article prove  why waste money on  trolling the trolls...  I guess some people just cant take criticism. these Goddamn weak-minded people trying to prove an agenda are ruining everything I care about...
tragic  the waste of talent like tatiana.
never watched the show  thank goodness I didn t. when I saw the trailer  I could kind of tell that the show was going to be crap  and also this show was meant for feminists and women who hate men.wonder women was one of those few female movies that was actually really good. I dont know of any other female movies  just wonder women.stan lee is most likely churning in his grave.I can watch the indiana jones movies  including kingdom of the crystal skull  and still have fun watching them.
lol na. they just know their show sucks so they are trying to ride the  your all racists or misogynists  and acting like this was just a genius troll.. like yeahhh.. sure you wrote a bad show and hurt your career and  reputation badly as a  gotcha ... suuuuure
haha I love the whole argument about how there is so much resistance to female superheroes... ahuh  you do understand that a lot of fans favourite characters are female right  she-hulk was beloved before they got their dirty little hands on her. in fact this show wouldn t exist if she wasn t popular with the fan-base so Im called bs on the resistance to female superheroes. another thing to point out is manga anime which have entire shows works with female mc s or an entire female cast and guess what  people love them. I know its shocking right  almost like the quality of the writing is important or something.
I didn t watch it. glad to know it was horrible.
still with the same  people dont like female superheros  bs. just write a good show and people will like it  no matter who is the lead  it is thatsimple. stop making excuses for your crap shows.
Ive actually heard people defending this show  and wow  I wish I was that easily amused. instead of watching terrible things marvel are pushing out nowadays  I was multI booting an older desktop that I got for less than  110 and upgrading my windows 11 main desktop  as well as playing different multiple different games  aside from that. I would actually rather watch paint dry rather than most of the garbage that marvel has put out the last few years.   thor love and thunder   I would rather watch wcw thunder  and even though Im a big pro wrestling fan  thatshow sucked. I was 8 1 2 years old when wcw went bankrupt and got purchased by vince mcmahon in 2001. even in second grade  I knew it was bad.
this is so f  ked up
black widow  nebula  maria hill  gamora  scarlet witch........nobody had a problem with any of these characters in the mcu. this   men dont like women characters  thing is an outright lie and complete bullshit. as a man Im sick of hearing it and being used as a scapegoat. those movies I have watched  paid for  and bought on bluray. this trash I wouldn t waste a second of my time on. I type this as Im taking a break from playing the guardians of the galaxy game that came out last year. the game that features one or more of the characters Imentioned. hmmm.....
money laundering.
this complete bs .. .  the show was not bad  on purpose   it was bad because the writing and woke agenda was bad...  they are just making stupid excuses at this point..
lol doing the most to ostracize a fanbase that ya whole franchise was built on lmao. stop coming at us with lazy scripts and weird social hottakes. she hulk was simply lazy af.
why wouldnt men want to watch a show with a women lead I like women they are nice to look at aven women who r not conventially beautiful kathy bates is one of my favorite actors she was awesome in misery.
toxic showrunners and writers. the state of video entertainment  be it movie or series  is a pathetic  ideological joke.
predicting someone s logical response does not make you psychic or intelligent.
yeah!!!!youreally got me. o.oso basically  you pissed the mcu movie goodwill away on shitty tv shows  out of spite sorry  but Im not buying it- you cant fix stupid.
bruh this just sounds a major waste of marvel s budget. cheers for giving people jobs but way to go on ruining a popular franchise and wasting time money
how bad does this make kevin fiege look  he spent 20 years building the mcu only to have one writer insult and drive away the very audience he spent 2 decades building...kevin is just a coward who didn t have the balls to stand up to gao. pathetic!
she referred to herself as a woman. I dont accept that. even a supreme court judge cant define what a woman is. so what am I to make of this writer saying she is a woman.
so glad this show was terrible. I never would ve found your channel without it.
im not buying it. sounds like desperate damage control for a flop show. the writers are trash and have no idea how to write a good show so they come out with this excuse to try to cover up how hard they suck.
wasting millions of dollars for a franchise series just to mock and disrespect fans. do this back in the 50  youre shot in the street. hateful propaganda leads to bankruptcy. do the math  marvel!
you all hate it but you all kept watching it. why  because you planed a long time ago to ues the show as content for your pop culture outrage chanles and they knew that. she-hulk as a comic would make fun of what was going on with marvel comics and its readers and critics. the comic was always less interested in fine plot than those things. Imean she-hulk would do things like rip the comic page she was on in half just to get of of a situation and tell her readers they were basic for reading x-men like everyone else. in this regard the show nailed what the comic was about and I doubt the antI sjw crowd was even aware that they were probably going to be made fun of directly by this show. Imyself knew she-hulk wouldn t be she-hulk if her show didn t piss off the likes of critical drinker and the daily wire. mission accomplished. welcome to the deep cut satire comic books of the 80s in tv format  sorry you were the target  dont take it personal  its just jokes.
no. they simply have no talent.
I cant wait for marvel to die  to see people finally wake up to how terrible the mcu has always been was worth this awful show
they just wasted money it was an epic fail its bad enough she looked like shrek 2 but the feminist writing was disastrous.
xoxoxo
so thats why itsucks
multimillions for trolling  leftist humor
how is this crappy show trolling the trolls  what kind of dumb idea is that   Im making a bad show to make you feel bad  bs. really - well troll away - not watching the show anyway.
yeah...sure...I said similar things about failing on intention  botching things spectacularly...and making a fuss about it as  show ....when I was like...a 9 years old insecure boy. alex stein is trolling trolls. jessica gao is just a seriously bad writer that tries to insert her life story into a superhero series to make her greater than she is. her jokes are unfunny  her  empowered  women are insecure  misogynistic sl ts that are caricatures of real women and her  hero  cant control her anger just for the most miniscule amount of time. in a real marvel cinematic universe she would have been put down by other superheros as a simple villain. to justify her bad writing by telling that it is done intentionally is laughable and proves only thatshe is fully incapable of actually writing good episodes. at least one episode could have been made watchable to prove her merits...instead she just failed. even in trolling trolls
it wasn t funny though. nobody thinks this shit is entertaining. it was boring for the most part and barely any plot because they focused so much on  trolling
you say youre not male  but do youreally know youre not male   seems like its hidden hostility toward those questioning their gender.  lol.
nobody watches thatshitshow lol and thats why it wont get a second season
marvel was mediocre stepped their game up with infinity war and end game. since its been nothing but shit.
if its bad then fucking fix it
thats pretty lame.
pure cope.  it was written to be bad  it just went over your head!  utterly ridiculous. it was more propped up  man-hating trash. end of story.
lol the marvel critics are just whiny. all any of yall ever do is complain and whine. lol I cant finish this video that voice is just too much.
and it demeaned men in any way possible.also most of the writers were angry single middle age women. a didn t expect more.
nice try lol... make a terrible show... then say u did it on purpose.  there was no genius in this show... it was complete garbage from beginning to end.  awful on every level.  poor acting... poor writing... poor direction... it looked like a really bad episode of buffy the vampire slayer.  I havent seen cgI so bad since the 90s.  given that they couldnt even break the top 10 on their own network.... I think it was a big mistake.  if they made a cool show... people would have loved it.  imagine making a show that was written to attack the customer.  you get what u get... like no season 2 lol.
as a man  I d fully support this show if it actually represented what feminism was meant to be. feminism started off as  I want to be treated equal as men   a very valid and quite noble goal imo. but at some point it became  all men are idiots and incels and women are better than them at everything   which I just cant support at all. probably my least favorite thing about this show is their generalization. Ive seen tons of feminists over the years complain about people generalizing women  yet they feel in this show that its okay to generalize men as idiots and incels who are beneath women  and something I saw online that really bugged me is I saw a reddit post where a guy complained that they were generalizing men  and people commented to that person saying stuff like  if it actually offends you then youre probably that exact kind of person. if you weren t  you wouldn t care . but  like  all the feminists who complained about that kind of generalization for them felt offended because they weren t that kind of person so why cant men feel offended when they re portrayed as such  if they wanted to make the show bad on purpose  they succeeded because I hate how this was treated
garbage. they just aren t good at making stuff.
copium
no one forces you to watch marvel products. watch at your own risk. or dont watch at all. but if you do and dislike  that doesnt give you permission to obliterate your own personal life choices and decisions. go for a hike in the woods instead with your time. or just grow up if watching stuff.
why do you and jeremy  quarterpounder  nambla pretend to be into comics and games  when y all are clearly not
dude  melonie plays ys. thats the type of niche  awesome gaming experiences that real gamers explore  not surface level casuals stuck on madden and assassin s creed. melonie even draws her own manga!maybe explore her content on social media a bit better before you try to talk down to her...
@otterloopb  no one knows or cares about that rpg.lol typical scenester.her manga is probably as garbage as swagkage s.
