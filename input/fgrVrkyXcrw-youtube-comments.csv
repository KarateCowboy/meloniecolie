I find it fascinating that the people who bravely fight for strong women characters when they see a strong confident woman character go- oh no no  she need to be less confident   less sexy  or she may make someone feel uncomfortable  best make her a dude so no one can get jelly of her!
I ll never understand why video game developers wanna make their women unattractive and lose their femininity now. you can have a strong and feminine character without sacrificing anything.
Imiss legend anniversary underworld lara. they nailed her character design there imo.
lara is beautiful.. if she isn t beautiful  she isn t lara  done!
you want to be like her   you want to be with her   ... she is a power fantasy ... you cant achieve it.  but you can want to.    best quote of the stream.
they can make soft features in a statue. they did it hundreds of years ago all the time in europe.
thatstatue doesnt look like any version of lara I have ever seen  classic or reboot era. they took a unique  distinct look and character and turned her into  generic female adventurer copy 355 .
you aren t wrong. they could have given her more female features in statues. all you have to do is google search of the greek statues. I have seen better female statues here in oklahoma. I grew up with early lara croft games and love them. I hated the fact they changed her from the go getter adventurous type. she was like sydney fox from relic hunter. she didn t have to sacrifice her female qualities to do things. it kills me that they have to take a woman down and make her less special to say that is what woman should be like.
my lara croft will always be the original. I ll never forget the days as a child in the 90s watching my dad play tomb raider on ps1  as my mum read the maps to him. only for him not to listen  get lost and then my mum would get pissed and then he d listen and do as she said.years later when new tomb raider games was released on the ps2  my mum and youngest sister played them together.this new tomb raider interests no one in my family  my youngest sister gave it a go and she hasn t really played it much.
Imiss the good old days when the entertainment industry didn t cower in fear of puritan nutjobs.
if Imade thatsculpture of laura I would be ashamed of myself. they screwed the face up big time. just look at all the old statues in greece and you can see how easy it is to make feminine facial features. this was a deliberate choice to neutralize her feminine side. they are continuing to destroy her legacy because she was so loved by so many women in her original form and they want to erase that. you are totally right with the examples you pulled up of strong  curvy and beautiful women that perfectly showcase how it could have been done properly. but once again someone has ruined a beloved character in an attempt to virtue signal to earn favor as an  ally .
the original lara croft  with tight light blue top and khakI shorts was as iconic a video game character as mario or sonic. now she s just a generic female... not exceptionally colorful  pretty or special  no boobs to speak of  no shapely figure. just ordinary looking. and instead of shooting bats and tigers and solving puzzles with her gymnastic skills and wits  she now murders about 300 people in every game and thinks nothing of it. thats not my lara. thats not an interesting character. thats woke lara.
my wife has played and loved tomb raider and lara croft all her life  made me watch all the movies and we both have this to say   Im offended!
its sad that when they created her originally with her box type body it was cause they couldn t round her out cause it would bog down the game then graphics got better and better and she became less box looking and more womanly. but your right in she was created on the girl power image of I can do what a man can cause I trained to get there. now you have this movement where you have to look so androgynous if your female cause boobs are bad mmm-kay as a great counselor would say. so great work and keep your head high. your killing it
I love thatsome of the same people who argue that a design like lara croft is unrealistic would fight you to the death defending tlou2 abby as being perfectly realistic.
been really enjoying the content. love the new channel and nice to see another creator who is open about their religious beliefs. keep up the great work.
you hit this nail on the head  thatstatue is deliberately ugly. and I like the reboot version of lara. new sub here  I learned about you from the quartering. I play a lot of mount and blade  bannerLord  fallout 2  and skyrim  heavily modded. like a lot of guys  I almost always create female characters. nothing  trans   its just if I am going to spend hours watching my character while guiding them through their adventures  I would rather be looking at an attractive female. when I got the new tomb raider games  I was struck by how little modding is available for lara s outfits and appearance  and how difficult it is to apply what little there is. I read online that this was done deliberately by the developers  because they wanted lara to be a strong female character  and not be transformed into a sexualized barbie doll by the gamers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              this struck me as more misogynistic than any sexy outfit that the game owner  who paid for the game  could put on her. modding is a huge part of gaming  and making it harder  on purpose  seems like a really bad business model. not only in gaming  but in art and society in general  there is a war being waged against beauty.
I didnt mind reboot lara so much though her amazing ability to destroy everything she touched and seem almost fragile and incompetent at times was a bit annoying.  it really makes me miss the classic and legends lara who was very confident and unflappable in dire situations.  it was part of her charm! and being a red blooded male  the eye candy was a plus as well.
Ive only just recently found out about you  but Im liking you more and more!Im so tired of this backwards idea thatstrong women cant just be women. who doesnt like a badass  they dont all have to  nor should they  look like a dude... otherwise  what the heck sets them apart  strong enough to throw you across the room  but the  intimidating  part is having curves  the women that paved the way for strong women in games were  and always have been...actual women that look like women! what a major disservice to lara croft
excellent vod  mel! your take on unified lara s look is spot on! she really does look like a young teenage boy! I dont like it! God forbid we can be allowed to have hot sexy strong feminine women in games.
its like the people that complain about 2b from the nier automata game. thats one of the most confident and bad ass female characters Ive seen to date and yet I see  feminists  whine about her  proportions  constantly... I honestly think it comes from a place of self-hatred and extremely low self-esteem.
dont complain!  we all know the best women are transwomen.  all those transwomen breaking female sports records proves it!  you go  gurls!!
@cheeseburger cake  these people are not feminists  dont be mistaken. what they ve done to lara is literally the opposite of feminism  its just american political correctness. Im a feminist and I definitely didn t ask for any of this.
@svobodovaeva  I can respect that your a feminist but I think if you told the  left sided  feminists that your ok with sexy   hot females in movies games etc they would call you a far right and harass you. when I picture a feminist these days its someone with brightly colored hair thats overweight and is a huge fan of  consequence culture  and not necessarily a female and rails non-stop about  equaity  not equality.
@cheeseburger cake  no need to generalize please    its probably because extreme feminists are the loudest  they re definitely not the majority. but still...its only crystal s se s choice to make lara look like this  dont blame a movement  crystal never listens to what people actually want. they give us fans stale breadcrumbs and expect us to be grateful. I hate them with passion.
reason being is  we ve brought ourselves to a point where we can only  relate  to a character person who physically looks exactly like us  even though physical appearance makes up a small part of our characterIve always resonated the strongest with female characters  I get it from my dad. doesnt mean Im gay  doesnt mean Im trans  it just is what it is  and I dont need female characters who look like me. in fact  in addition to that resonance  I greatly admire femininity and the female form  but not because I want to be that. woman are just badass and hot  man  I dont know how else to put it. hahahaits very very odd though  how one second we were dealing with men boys not being allowed to show feelings   men dont cry    dont show emotion  all that  now  if a guy is more sentimental or more emotional  more caring  dude must be gay  no no no he must just be a woman in the wrong body. like.....what
look up the interview with the devs of horizon zero dawn. they literally say they dont think women that are attractive can be strong. and that is the mentality of the so called woke devs.
@brad dl  thanks I ll look it up.
its called wokeism
@brad dl  can you tell me the specific interview or when or where that was
they think women cant be hot and attractive in games
@skrellowtyper  and if they are those then they re fan service.
this. I totally understand and agree with the need for having and supporting strong female characters  and just find itso bizarre when that has to be  only specifically this one type of strong female character . cant be too attractive  cant be feminine   must be independent but not too independent  must be strong but only in a masculine way  must have become who she is through struggle and hardship and trauma  must be constantly threatened with rape and abuse  wtf    must be a fighter but eww guns give her a bow and arrow or sword  etc.
disney loved strong  confident women until one actual strong  confident woman said her opinions on twitter
lgbt lara. thats why she look like dude.
@dzul rashdi  itbdosnet relly like a dude maybe they want to make lara a lesbian
@noirmorter  its not imo.
@skrellowtyper  I couldn t believe it when he said it  I thought he was messing with me. at the time I never realized he was serious.
it is because of a political religion called intersectionality which became prominent during the early 2010s but was taught in university for years before that
@dean cushen  sounds like cypher from mgsv  the phantom pain
thats one thing dragon age did well  their powerful women go from old sinicle dragon lady to short strong willed dwarf girl.
you can also have both a strong and feminine woman  and have her be sexualized and fan-service-y. japan does this all the time with anime and video game characters. strong female role model  and also best selling 3ft tall statue merchandise in a sexual pose.so maybe its really two separate  issues  that they re combining together.
for some reason they seem to think that it is sexist for men to be attracted to women  but they are overlooking the fact that lesbians are also attracted to attractive women.
does look a bit like a man in drag.
for the same reason they wanna do it to us.
@brad dl  what s weird is the young woman aloy is modeled after is a lot more attractive than the character in the game same with dina from the tlou2 theyre taking above average girls and making them look manly  idk why everyone wants women to be men these days its weird af and also they want men to be soft too makes no sense
the swimsuit in underworld.. oh yea
she was pretty in legend. but they changed her personality too much  making her more soft. I still dig the classic lara more because of it.
@boro b.  legend lara wasnt soft at all  she simply wasnt on edge all the time.when situation called  legend lara was fierce af
I just played through those last month.  they are my favorites.  all the parts of the games seemed to be executed perfectly with one another.
@charming peasant  I didn t say that legend s lara was soft  I said they made her more soft than the original lara. original lara is an anti-hero with borderline psychotic personality traits  showing less emotions than an ordinary person. legend anniversary underworld lara became  noble  if you will  more human. legend lara will feel for a dead innocent she didn t manage to save - original lara wont give a fuck if she were on her place.
this version looks like david bowie thats not lara!
agree. legend anniversary underworld lara is the canonical lara for me.
replaying anniversary cause damn Imissed the curvy badass lara !!
angel of darkness and last revelation lara was my favorite. legend lara was ok tho
you speak the truth
ah yes thats when lara was like  im doing things because of my daddy  and never shuts up about her parents ever since
@un loq  well they mention the design  not the plot  d
wasn t toby gard  original creator of lara  involved in her character design for all three of those games
@nocternia obscura  I dont like her design either  there
@new aeon  only in the first game  he started to work for the franchise again in legend
@un loq  oh noo! eh  I still like you  just a tiny bit less. I would give you 2 cookies instead of 3
@nocternia obscura  you can keep them damn cookies
@un loq    @un loq  I had to do a quick search   so he worked on legend  some minor work in anniversary but definitely helped work on underworld ! I always felt like lara was lara in underworld    so this cheers me up  3 from wikI    for tomb raider  underworld  gard s work included co-writing the story  directing the cinematics  voice direction  motion capture direction  along with camera setup and managing the animators and lighters   and directing the european tv advert for the game. 4  gard and eric lindstrom received a nomination for  best writing in a video game  by the writers guild of america for their work on underworld. 10
the best design lara as beautiful as possible
I have the anniversary on wiI  its my little sisters but she abandoned it with her old wii. I was never into tomb raider on sony playstation 1. the best game on that console was castlevania symphony of the night. metal gear solid  resident evil trilogy  but probably my favorite after castlevania sotn was silent hill  silent hill is a masterpiece in survival horror.
yeah they did  same here I love design of lara there
probably the best design for her  imo. I prefer the personality of classic lara slightly more  a bit too much  oh  my past trauma  batman stuff in the first reboot series imo  but she was still lara and it was the best case for rebooting her. the main difference was that I always felt classic lara was almost a femme fatale who gave no shits about the last t-rex or anything  whereas legends lara was an actual  hero .current reboot lara apologised to deer and was  literally a cornered animal   an actual quote from a marketing guy... wtf   literal !  .
@boro b.   not so much when she shot several times while threatening her atomic blonde ex-friend.
@hue jaynus    70 s david bowie  or just blue jean version
that was the best remake reboot we ever got
legend had the best face
classic and lau lara is the best
exactly the point of such characters  I cant be goku but the fact I want to be is still solid motivation to go to the gym  d
it has been a thing forever for male characters. kratos  marcus fenix  chris redfield  duke nukem  bj blazcowicz  etc. Im never going to be those guys or even look like those guys  but its fun to pretend. for a short time  I want to say 90s and 00s   that finally became available female gamers too  who could imagine being lara croft  tifa lockhart  joanna dark  bayonetta  etc. but now they re being told  no  you have to only aspire to be like x . I want to imagine Im attractive as well as badass when playing a power fantasy game. dont women want the same thing  why would you want to roleplay looking just like... yourself
@owtdaftuk  nude mods make it even better and help you ignore the awful writing of the story
even the dudes looked more curvy...
the silly thing is that if they wanted to respect the character  they should have made a statue that had a classic legends style lara back to back with the new reboot one. classic with her two guns  reboot with her bow  both looking badass. I personally wish reboot tr was just not a tr game because thats my main issue with it  I enjoyed it as a game   but if we are going to have  alternate  versions  make it clear that these are indeed different people at heart but both are valid and great characters.then again  Ive always thought the best shot in the ass the tr fanbase needs would be to get an official crossover where classic lara meets reboot lara and they team up and respect each other  with classic lara teaching reboot lara a thing or two about standing up for herself. put to rest the idea that  classic lara is outdated and needs to be erased .
she looks more like a generic npc instead bruh
@huxley _s  I dunno man. I remember people used to say all this stuff about jennifer aniston and she is greek. she does have broad shoulders and a similar build to this and was still feminine.
another example is krystal ball. she is built and thats what she looks like in a swimsuit.
they are saying that angelina jolie is too attractive  therefore the woke version of ugly  therefore bodyshaming.
I played it as a teen older ones  it was fun loved those games!
the key thing about lara that made her not indiana jones imo was thatshe was graceful and compitant. while indiana jones and also nathan drake are clumbsy and lucky.
wow you have cool parents.
oh ho man! I remember when my dad came home one day with tomb raider for pc  and he said   son  look what I got for you..  I was 8 or 9 I think  lol.
yeah  nothing says progressive reboot like having your character become a mass murderer of men.who somehow doesnt go batshit considering before the island she never killed a person... yet when you are done with the island how many guys has she killed 100  200  more even  the sequel to that game should have played in an asylum or something.if we are to believe that lara is a  normal  girl she would be batshit with ptsd at least for the prologue of the next game.thats what I hate about the progressive agenda npcs ruining franchises left and right they never even think their own fucking plans through to the end and all that is usually left is a franchise hollowed out and a husk of its former self.
same thing with jill valentine from the re3  remake .
@fransens  she did have ptsd.its explained thatshe had to have therapy and had survivor s guilt.
my opinion is  they re just going to ruin another awesome game.
thats another problem they have with her  she trained to get where she is rather than spending 5 minutes watching a parkour video and instantly becoming world-class.
transman most likely  yay representation.
very realistic. she just abuses steroids like some gymbros.
tomb raider be damned  tlou2 definitely has the most fragile fans Ive ever encountered. literally cannot accept anyone having a different opinion even in the most slight way and will call anyone who dares voice even the most lightweight criticism as bigots  haters  idiots and everything-phobic. genuinely the most toxic and crazy fans Ive ever witnessed.
abby doesnt even look like the real life model they based her on  because they thought it would make her look too unrealistic
its pretty realistic shes just not natty
ironically  that resulted in the only outfit mods being available were nude mods
I still struggle to understand why women would want female characters to not look like women  idealised or otherwise. superheroic characters are idealised  but even if they are supposed to be  normal people   they should still look like... well  normal. making female characters look like men seems like the opposite of empowerment  its saying  a woman can only be strong if she looks  thinks and acts like a man .
thatstatue isn t lara  its abby from tlou2. anyway  I think we should be rather thankful that even though some of the changes have been annoying  especially some of the cringe dialogue   they were still enjoying and fun games overall.... you know  they could have totally fucked up the franchise as the original idea of the 2013 reboot was that lara would be lesbian with sam.... so thank God that never happened  but it was originally in the planning.
youre the best melonie  keep it up!! so happy that you are sharing your takes. they are
I think the bottom line is  when have developers try to make lara more  real  and  relatable  they re really just saying   ordinary  and  boring . I totally agree  and have always felt this way about classic lara  what made her unique was her ultra feminine appearance  and she had the brains  the wits  athletic skills and knew how to fight!! thanks for this awesome video!! its great to see male and female gamers alike  who totally understand what classic lara stood for!
respect the passion you have for this franchise
you should ve included brenoch adams tr1 reimagined cover  because lara s arms look really strong and cool! plus thats made by crystal dynamics franchise art director so its likely lara will have muscle like that in the next game  lots of people on twitter really liked her muscularity. personality wise I think lara has potential to be depicted like her classic self. with maturing  lara  survivor lara  can maybe find being feminine empowering rather than rejecting it  which Im sure many women could relate to . when survivor lara was at school she got picked on I think  mentioned in blood ties  maybe because she was a  tom boy   because in survivor biography I think she did do rifle club  and hiking or something along those lines similar to classic lara  so she really didn t embrace more  feminine  characterises because of the feeling like she has to fit into an archetype. as for lara being very active and more carefree this can also be included in unification as she s moved on from her dads death. as for lara being unattainable this can also be displayed  with men a male companion or whoever hitting on her and lara brushing them off  like aloy in horizon zero dawn  saying she doesnt have time because archaeology and adventure is her true love.but with thatsaid its understandable to be disappointed by a lack of a more  feminine  characteristics and confidence  especially considering her debuting in the 90 s  rebelling against other leading game characters  with her femininity being rebellious  and a symbol of strength rather than weakness  . but there is also another argument to add that femininity only equates to curves  big lips etc  but the idea of gender roles and stereotypes are tricky and equating feminine with curves etc when it can come in different forms is also a valid argument.
the legend anniversary underworld series were the first tomb raider games I played and I absolutely loved them.  angelina jolie made a perfect lara croft for thatseries of games.  to me this statue is  creepy  unrecognizable as lara from either the old or the new survivor series of games  and no I dont want one of my favorite gaming protagonists to look so - meh.
I found you some years ago and I am so glad you are sharing your opinions with us now. you are awesome  powerful  sweet and wholesome. we need more of you.
Im absolutely adoring the new channel  inspired me to be more of myself and do my content how I want! keep killing it!
I stumbled across your channel a couple of days ago  on lotr   and the more Im watching the more impressed  as in its rare to see in this media  I am by you and your attitude. I was am pleasantly surprised by the biblical end segments - particularly because its not just a token verse out of context and it is clear youre not simply a  cultural Christian .I have loved lara croft for a long time too  there is a major  over steering effect   not limited to this case  where people are running from one extreme into the arms of another. I am not a lara croft purist - I feel like certain aspects are a teensy bit too exaggerated  but agree they re making her too masculine. from the models you showed the 2nd one seemed ideal - excellent blend of muscle  waistline and sleekness  is that a word !  while believably practical  not just a weights body and not a pilates body.God bless  keep up the good work. edit add  meant to say I agree she should be confident and feminine. would want her to be more chaotic good than chaotic neutral though personally!
I ll be honest  I never really got into the original tomb raider games  my first true experience with the series was legend but Im a huge fan of the lara croft from the legend anniversary underworld era and wish they d bring her back. I did like tr 2013 and rise but agree with the disappointment over how lara is portrayed.
absolutely agree melonie!! thatstatute doesnt look as feminine as lara is to be. strong  sexy and confident. I dont understand why they have to defeminize some of the womanly figures a lot of us grew up with to admire and have as inspiration  such as lara  black cat and many more.
I would have never guessed that this is lara croft. she has a completly different face  her outfit is rather generic for a  tomb raider  and the only thing that kinda gives it away is a small necklace - which almost nobody will recognize.she just looks like a gender bend nathan drake tbh.
thank you for pointing out how the reboot took away lara s confidence and outwardly expressive femininity I have been told for years by people that I was just dumb and looking at it the wrong way but that was one of my biggest issues with the survivor timeline that and also if Im being honest all three games felt super samy like dont get me wrong the gameplay across the legend trilogy my favorite tomb raider timeline wasn t vastly different but I still remember standout moments from each of those games what my favorite levels were and if you showed me screenshots from all three I could probably tell you which one was which aside from the graphical enhancements of the new trilogy I dont really think I could do that as well
great content. love your takes. I liked the new tomb raiders just fine  but I do miss the long  elaborate tombs. I wish they would do more like the originals
love this one  lara has always been one of my favorites.  for me  having an opinion on someone or something doesnt make you judgemental  just offering a different perspective which can be a good thing if taken properly.  keep it up mac   God bless!!
you are doing what you do best  melonie mac. never stop doing what you do. also love lara croft. she is a badass and sexy too. there s nothing empowering about what they are doing to lara croft right now. she was awesome and always a next level fitness warrior
I was literally thinking in dnd aligments and called her chaotic neutral in my mind and then melanie said the same thing seconds later. love it.they re trying to make her lawful good when she was a chaotic neutral treasure hunter rogue.
I came for the hot takes but stayed for the hot pics! I love that you are also showing the receipts of real women being fit  curvy and feminine.
just found your channel  I love it! I completely agree with your take. a lot of current female characters comics video games  just look  androgynous. the template for female action heroes should be fitness models from a physical aspect. a couple hollywood actresses that are exceptions to rule  scarlett johansson  charlize theron atomic blonde . sexy-beautiful-gorgeous is out  looking like a 15yr old boy is in. lastly  youre correct   judge not  lest ye be judged  - sermon on the mount in matthew 5 7. have an awesome day and stay real!
I dont know who you are but ive watched a couple of your videos on lara and I love your ideas and your passion for the character  reminds me a lot of my own interest in duke nukem and how the character has been handled. cantotally relate to the unpopular opinion feeling. you ve got some awesome content and you hit the nail on the head with lara. thanks for the videos
great video!  love your courage and respect it.  keep up the good work and hopefully the internet will continue to be the really pleasant  respectful place its always been yep.  ps.  your explanation of the old law vs the new law was great.   its been a tough one to articulate let alone on the internet.  keep it up!  -
especially with that chiseled  strong jaw.
oh whoa that is that is not a good look thatstatue is having oh my oh my goodness
lara was and is an icon of the industry arguably more famous than her own franchise because of the impact she had for the industry and for female characters like I remember somebody pointed out to me why the movie was called lara croft tomb raider was because of the impact she had on pop culture in general why is itso hard to just respect the legacy of characters
not gonna lie  I am a big fan of the reboot trilogy. but I can see the point.
@chris fox  I hope I didn t come off as too overly aggressive to the survivor trilogy because I dont completely hate it its not like another realm mortal kombat situation
thank you for pointing out that God teaches us not to judge something I have personally struggled with lately is seeing how many people around me like to condemn others for the sins they commit or for simply life choices and interests that they dont agree with its been a struggle for me because it just doesnt seem like the right thing to do as Christians and also because if Im being honest a good chunk of these people like to use the Bible to condemn others with direct lines of scripture but choose to selectively ignore other parts of the scripture when it benefits them sorry for unloading all this here but it just felt important to say and wanted to thank you for speaking about this
Ive not played rise or shadow yet.  part of me tried to resolve the lara of the reboot with the previous version as someone who is going to end up looking like she does because of this traumatic adventure where she has to find thatself-confidence  etc. that everyone loves about classic lara.  then the other part of me thinks like you said to someone else  its kind of like an alternate lara.  what I dont get is all the hate people have towards the female fans who like seeing a character that is feminine  strong  intelligent  confident  etc.  its like there s this weird idea that in order for a woman to be strong she has to be a man.  at least thats how the puritans on thatside seem to be so hardline when it comes to design.anyway  I appreciated your comment.
@emily alucard  not at all.  I can see your point.
I love classic laura. when I was a kid my favorite character in media was indiana jones. when I learned there was a game I could play like that I asked my mom to get the game. I loved laura since that very first day booting up the first tomb raider game. its one of the most important game franchises of my childhood. I have bought the games many times over the years. for consoles and pc. I wish they would have left well enough alone with laura croft and made her less and androgynous.its sad because its the same battle across all media.
look up  alicenevermind classic lara croft cosplay  or  enjI night lara croft cosplay . both capture different looks for the original lara really well  original lara imo went through two different phases  before tomb raider chronicles and after tomb raider chronicles   they should have used either of them for sculpturing this statue instead of how they did it  thats not really lara.
lara was my hero... I dare to say I had a love and obsession for lara as hard as mel does... I was going to get into archaeology for her... but then the reebots came... and....  well...  Im a fan of assassins creed now
I think its best said this way. the old lara is someone I want to be  the new lara is someone like me.original lara croft was a superhero
my wife and I just had a similar conversation about the lack of real feminine body types in halo infinite. she is quite upset because they dont represent her  and they dont reflect the female spartans in the lore who look more like lara croft of old then the statue.new sub. loving you content melanie!
I agree with you about the statue.  they did the same thing to the latest assassin creed female characters  kassandra and eivor.  they looked more like football linebackers  instead of women.  even their facial features were masculine.  really enjoying your channel  melonie!
leaving you a comment  I originally watched the whole video but didn t get to comment ! same  been a long time lara fan  I so freaking agree with the premise ! she is who we want to be  as women and men want to date ! one of the creators for the tr 1 movie with angelina said the very same thing on the behind the scenes ! femme fatale and unattainable goals  3 but something to aspire to. I personally love shadow lara but she overlapped a super dark period of my life at the time and the setting in central-south america was a plus. I would love for her to come back as a woman who has become stronger and her attire is more fit for her curvy without needing to lie about her being a woman ! I enjoyed a lot of her outfits in shadow but others - you could tell - were simply there to keep covering her up    like dude we are in the hot ass jungles of mexico xd swamp ass anyone   anyhow keep up the awesome work with your videos ! I really love the picture slides to show you can have a woman who has muscles but is still very curvy...its like whoever is designing her is trying to design her as a man  down to her stance   .  also her hands on thatstatue are huge. big shoulders and enormous dorsImuscles ...like a dude. we have guy cosplayers in the tr scene and Im all for crossplay because I am working on my skyrim crossplay but I like the distinct separation of lara being a woman. lara is my go to girl for super femme fatale power  3
until I saw the comparison of the 3 reboot lara s at the start I never realised how different she looked. as weird as this sounds  lara croft was like the first female figure to give me my  sexual awakening  as a boy back in the 90s. I was literally in love with her back then. I still think reboot lara today is cute  especially in the first reboot when she was skinnier   but if I was a boy  I dont think I would have had thatsame sexual awakening because she lacks any sort of  sex appeal  and actually looks quite butch. I know thats a really weird thing to say  but whatever  I think it gets my point across. ironically though  I think her lack of sex appeal in the games is what caused the mass amount of lewds people have made of her. people want her to be sexy. reboot lara is the most lewded female game character ever apparently.
yikes I knew tom holland was in the uncharted movie but I didn t know he was the new character model for laura croft
Im so glad to have melonie s voice behind this train of thought
I just stumbled onto your channel and I have to say you nailed it! I played every iteration of lara and the tomb raider games going all the way back to the first game at its release.  yes Im that old   I dont understand why they have to destroy the strong  beautiful  confident and smart character thatshe was  in order to fitsome narrative is beyond me. I just wanted to throw in an edit here and point out that the statue looks a lot like the russian shot-putter olga ryabinkina. look it up.
always love mel s tomb raider vids. cant agree more!
women like classic lara exist  they re just rare  thats why they re special. once a discovery brazil     presenter  doctor karina olianI  came to college once to talk about when she did parachuting  swam with sharks and climbed the everest  all narrated in a flower dress. badass  feminine and real.
yeah lara croft was meant to make your jaw drop and if you were a bad guy she d break your jaw or shoot you in a very athletic way
hey melonie  just want to send you some good cheer. since you started this channel and I got here from the quartering  Ive enjoyed your part in my daily youtube routine! appreciate your commentary. unabashed Christianity is indeed the new punk rock.
hey melonie  I want to suggest that you do a follow-up video to this one sometime where you show examples of women cosplaying as lara.I just did a small search on tiktok and I haven t seen a single one that looks like androgynous larry lara.now  is that because men are demanding only one type of lara  or is it because those women identify with and love classic lara hmmm. oh how I wonder.
aw man  I really miss old lara... she was one of my favorite characters when I was little. I reaaaaallly miss her.
the dude walking the dog was so relatable
totally love you sister! amen and amen! I totally agree with what youre saying about how theyve changed lara croft. its sick and disgusting.. keep being a voice for what is right  good  and just  keep on sharing Jesus!  keep being a voice for the gaming community.
huh  so strong and brave and stunning  so fresh  so face to see the broad from the last of us getting a sequel. dunno why they changed her name to lara  precisely  though lmaoalso  homegirl has the stance of a 20 year old dude for whom every day is arm day. you only really get that raptor-like curling of the forearms if you do a ton of dumbbell curls without stretching or doing cardio. she stands like a guy in a rap video. but then they figured hey  give her a physiologically-impossible beaver breather and the absolute tightest 34c that target  excuse me ladies  targete lol  sells  and bam! shania twain s man I feel like a woman plays powerfully in the background
does this mean youre training to be an assassin now
so instead of becoming an archaeologist you became an assassin
@starsiegeplayer  I became a history lover xd lol
this. there s nothing wrong with reboot lara except thatshe s not lara. she s a neat new character thatshould have got her own franchise. instead  lara is now the grim  serious one and fucking nathan drake gets to steal being the quippy badass. classic lara was the closest we ve ever had to a female james bond or indiana jones. she was an icon  and a superhero. classic lara is an action movie protagonist. reboot lara is a horror movie protagonist. there is a huge difference.
you must be blind. its obviously not nathan drake. too masculine to be him.
still think the first crystal dynamics lara is probably the beautiful. I pretty much liked all the character designs in that game.
absolutely true. Im a huge lara croft fan since the first games back in the 90 s. Imiss her curves and sexiness. so sad what they have done to her
this is not my lara croft. thankfully  a true lara has been created by the team developing the angel of darkness remake and she looks phenomenal! she looks like she s in her 30 s  which is her true age  she looks perpetually pissed off but also very sexy. I looked up to lara growing up  I thought she was amazing  and thankfully I ended up growing a body like hers  not the face however      and her original version is still my favourite to this day. she and tifa lockhart were my idols growing up. I hated how they made reboot lara into a wet blanket.
I find it funny that they are trying to make a more realistic character  but they are too afraid to give her realistic muscles.
I actually liked the rebooted lara for the first game  since she wasn t supposed to be an athletic character in that game. she was an academic thrown into a crazy situation. they probably should have moved more into the athletic look as the games went on but I get what they were going for
hey melonie been following your channel for a long time love this new channel as well. really loving the unapologetic sharing of your faith. on the note of the law and the new covenant I highly recommend joseph prince he blew my mind saying similar things as you mentioned. also I totally agree the closer we get to God the less we want to sin even though we all fall short. keep up the great work!
I hope this isn t how she ll look in the next game
Im not a tomb raider fan  but I appreciate her using the thigh drop holster rigs  perfect position for open carrying a pistol tactically speaking. I have one for my glock 20  and solid snake used one to for his hk mk23 socom .45 acp and we all know he defined the male equal to laura  a bad ass lone wolf who accomplishes their missions.
when I heard that they wanted to unify the timelines.. I almost cried. there s no possible way to unify the tr timelines without cutting extraordinary content which they created but now choose to ignore and not elaborate upon  specifically speaking upon the core timeline  this statue  although I think would look more realised if it were in colour. it looks like ash from the rainbow six collab which looked hideous. she looked pale  frumpy and just thrown together and in no way like lara! lara did need a serious reform! just look back at the pervious tr marketing. thatshit was straight up grossly objectifying. that being said. lara shouldn t have ever lost her confidence and anti-hero nature. all her unique and independent qualities are being removed from this character so many of us love !! I just hope they ditch the double thigh strap holsters. cause its giving sottr and that game had some of the ugliest attire in a tr game ever.
classic lara was able to look more naturally alluring fully covered in winter weather gear while new lara cant come close to that level allure even while wearing a micro bikinImod.
ok. I know that I cant be the only person thinking melonie mac with a wonderbra would be an ideal laura croft!
they have done it in the games  they did it in the movies  they did it in the comics  now its time for the statues. what a bloke! looks like a character from tlou2. excellent video.
absolutly horrendous    oh how dare a woman look attractive!   insanity!
lara was a feminist icon. she was superhuman. ultra curvy yet incredibly athletic  totally driven  badass  dangerous  spent most games killing men. what s there not to love  probably they nerfed her because  as you said  you cant be her. part of all this is tearing down greatness. lara had to become the girl next door.
there was a figurine of kos-mos that had a similar strange  masculine face. it became legendary in the japanese collectible community who nicknamed it jashin mok-kos   evil God mok-kos  .this is jashin lara.
another great video. youre such an inspiration  every video is a banger.
I kinda agree with you.I dont think the statue looks  manly   although I ll grant you that it is a bit more androgynous.they seem to try to make her more like an average  realistic athletic body build. but I do prefer the older curvatious feminine physique. personally  I loved the angelina jolie version.
when I got the very first tomb raider game  my mom used to pick on me and she would always say  oh  joey is playing with his girlfriend again. this april 24th will be one year since we lost her to cancer. but  at least I will always have those memories to look back on.this version of lara is what would have pissed her off the most cause she used to tell my 7 sisters that they dont have to look like women in magazines  they are beautiful just the way they are. she said a woman should always be proud of the body she has  yes  its okay to make yourself look sexier if you want but  dont do itstupidly like making yourself throw up all the time  starving yourself to death. and she used to tell us boys to always respect a woman or women because when you disrespect them by calling them fat or any kind of insult like that  you are not only disrespecting her  you are disrespecting God as well.  mom was the voice of our family. she is probably talking God s ear off right now. lol. rest in peace  mom. love you and miss you lots.
we ve been making beautiful feminine statues for thousands of years  they could make her look more feminine less manly if they wanted. but  obviously their goal is the exact opposite.
weird question  but what would you say is the appeal of lara croft  Im thinking of adding her to a series I want to do and wanted a actual fan s opinion on her and the classical series.
oh thats easy! she s got those two big  round milky white eyes! what d you think I was gonna say
@chris casanta  heh.
she is sexy but her sexiness is not weaponized. what Imean is  she doesnt use it as a means to reach her goal. her sexiness is merely a by product of her lifestyle. her means to her goals have always been her wit  her intelligence  her curiosity of the world  and of course her huge arsenal of weapons. that is her appeal  in my opinion.
blinking rapidly doesnt change what that thing they call a statue of lara croft look like the real lara.   youre beautiful and awesome to boot!  keep up the great content.
its really about certain people according to themselves  not living up to  beauty standards  so they  unsexy  characters to make themselves feel better.
Ive never considered myself particularly religious I dont even know if I believe in God or not but I do find the Bible quotes at the end of your videos interesting and it gives me something to think about during my day
the issue was never realism to these people. they say it was...but really they just didn t want her to be sexy. and even in the realistic   muscular way  it makes them feel bad about themselves...but they cant have that.
give me lara croft form the witchblade tomb raider comic s  3
when I saw the picture of thatstatue  the first thought that came to mind was that it looks like nathan drake with a bit of a chest.  its so sad to see the deterioration of such an iconic character.
I understand you dont like the design of reboot laura as much  but do you enjoy the game play at all  I find them very fun to replay. getting ready to go through the 360 trilogy. tomb raider anniversary design is fantastic.
they want lara to be weak  and unsexy. its not the femininity they fear  its the sexiness. lara empowered girls to want to grow up and be strong and sexy. they are afraid of this.
you got me into anime years ago with your top anime vid claymore still on my top 5 list ty for that .  seriously its so nice to see you haven t been turned into one of these sith Lord wokies over the years.
thatstatue isn t... horrible. I agree  the worst part is probably the face. it definitely looks man-ish. the body isn t bad in my opinion. it certainly isn t overly feminine curvy but there s enough there. at least she doesnt have super broad shoulders   no hips. and to be fair that top is cut a lot lower than the original character model  Im also not seeing an undershirt but I do see her shoulder straps. I take it back about the worst part  the fact that her gun holsters are empty is the worst part. then her face.
0 59 tv contest question   which one is lara croft  a  b  c  or all of the above. me   wait what  where s none of the above
they should allow the gamer to create their version of lara  for a more personalized gaming experience for different types of gamers.
its kinda funny  I honestly had never heard of you till you created this new channel  coincidentally right around the time I bought every tomb raider game on steam.  I just figured youtube was tracking my purchases.  then  I hop back on twitter on the 28th of october after about a decade and your right there as a recommended follow  and I see that little cross and Im like huh  she s a Christian.  so I followed you there  hopped back on youtube and subscribed and started watching your videos.  its really nice to find a content creator who shares my faith as well as whatever other interests.
ruthless!!! I love it!!! I agree with you not taking away from her character but she doesnt look like lara!!! disappointed with gaming developers that concede to the wokies. when will itstop!!! get em melonie!!! rip them a new one!!!
I dont know if reboot lara would be considered  androgynous . I d consider ellie from the last of us  both 1 and 2  to be androgynous. lara is quite feminine to me. I d have to really hype myself up to wear a tanktop like she does in 2013 and syria  cuz my self-confidence is so low its basically underground. I dress pretty much exactly like lara does in rise but I dont think Im adrogynous  I am quite fine with being a girl but Im not a girly-girl  I cant stand make-up  Im visually impaired so applying it would be a pain and what s the point  lara strikes me as an introvert and kind of on the spectrum  my opinion  cuz Im high functioning asd and lara displays traits similar to my own  I do wish they would give her the backback and dual pistols back though
lara croft is slowly becoming my favorite male protagonist video game character.
critics wont be happy with lara as a female character until she is physically indiscernible from a male one.
one thing that I always loved about lara croft  the original lara croft  was she embodies the perfect combo of tomboy and hyper glam. it made her more badass. also  it went to show people that you can be  tomboyish  without being  butch ! at this point  lara looks  well  I personally dont want to come out and say it because people will be mad. but she looks like she didn t start out life as a she  they need to stop focusing on what lara croft looks like and focus on making the games good  if they actually asked fans of the character  they d say we want the original lara croft back!
whoa now  we all know cosplay is better than what the developers are making these days
imagine how lara would look like if a japanese game company took over tomb raider.
twitter would have a nuclear meltdown.
hell s yeah!
they re great games  but I dont count them as actual tomb raider games
@melonie mac go boom  thoughts on ps2 era laura
for me the perfect lara croft body would be the underworld promotional images ones . like the one she s getting attacked by the sharks and the cgI art ones.
yeah this lara croft statue looks like me in high school if I were to dress up as her back then.
Im kinda getting some abby smash vibes with this statue.lara croft ...
dont really mind the new design s  although Ive only played the first game from the reboot  2016 I think . Im not a huge fan of the series but I enjoyed room raider 2 when I was a kid. I dont think they can exaggerate  her shape in a  realistic  3d game. I just think it would look stupid. but I wouldn t complain if they made her waist a bit thiner. but isn t she like 16-18 in the new games  I dont know how old she was in the old games thought
this lara croft museum is not... well-researched  is it   if you could quickly cue up pictures of women who have the idealized body type of our videogame antiheroine here  they have no excuse.  they could should have immortalized ps1 lara for thatstatue  but they want to push their agenda.to add to the hilarity  I wrapped my workday before firing up this video.  throughout my shift  I talked with several women who could stand side-by-side with the gals you shared with us.also  the song you chose for the end credits is a cool-sounding representation of what you stand for here.
officially one of my favorite youtubers God bless you keep up the good work
they progressively made it worse.  I like what you did there. looooool
if I just saw the head and not the outfit  I would not even guess anywhere near this being lara croft.is this a statue to showcase just her classic outfit then  o.o  lolthat is seriously what it looks like.  someone just slapped her clothes on a generic department store mannequin and said   here  make a statue out of this.
the only thing thatstatue is missing is an adams apple  look at the hands  she would be out of place training to be a goal keeper. are we sure that isn t from the last of us
Imoved on to playing mostly japanese games now and have never looked back other than for indie scene in west. japan devs know how to create female characters that dont look like dudes and long may most them continue to ignore this strange modern woke mentality. Imiss the old school proper lara croft design  -
my minset from after the first game was she was like 17 18 and making her kinda weak turning her into a badass through the game was a good thing. then they just did the same thing for the most part.
I feel a remix coming on...  this dude is a laadddyyy  da na da na  this dude is a laaadddyy
why did they have to change her look nothing wrong with the old look. I completely agree with you. keep up the great content .
6 25  ... she might do yoga sometimes.  lol
gamers really need a push against these cultist developers. how much longer until we see game devs  with enough balls to push against these zealots!
I think youre spot on. on all points. lara can be strong and powerful as well as beautiful. not sure why folks that are feminist desire to degrade beauty. its odd and a bit vile I think. I dunno if itstems from jealousy or just plain envy. your also spot on when it comes to Christ porpoise her on earth. salvation and a rebirth of life is how you are gonna get into heaven. not of deeds and hollow works. working through Christ and his guiding light is the way. great content as always. keep up the good fight.
I love lara s look in the 2013 reboot I think they got it right  but in the second and third game   of the reboot   thats where I think they messed up  I remember noticing as the games wen t on and it was like why why are they spoiling an otherwise pretty character it really sucked  after that I totally got over her as a character and never paid attention to her since  2013 tomb raider is a 10 10 for me tho I think they did very well with everything in that game
some of those women you showed looked like they could also be samus aran irl.
too many studios now seem afraid to offend  so they go for a bland  realistic  look. Im starting to drift towards japanese games like final fantasy  persona etc because the characters actually have cool designs and interesting personalities.
only thing I have to say is when you brought the photo up of the model and said thats a real woman  hun we all know those pics are photo shopped so let s not get ahead of ourselves . but I do agree the statue is bad and Imiss old lara.
yesss!
that is not lara  that is lawrence .
I am so glad I found your lara croft videos. they re hilarious and make me feel very validated in my opinions. Ive always hated the idea that being feminine somehow makes you  weaker ... how ridiculous. as someone that has done archery and rock climbing all of her life  but also loves to wear heels and lipstick... there is space in the world for both things!on another note  I had a question about you saying that youre not a feminist. no hate or shade from me!! I was just wondering about it because for me  feminism means that men and women should have equal rights and are equally valuable in their own ways  which I feel like you believe as well  girl power!! . my question is  what does  feminism  mean to you  and why do you not consider yourself a feminist  really just genuinely curious. thanks so much for your awesome content! looking forward to more of your videos!!
sometimes its not about if the information being given is objectively true  what turns off people is how the information being given is  delicately recieved. certain words and phrases when heard just dont resonate with people and they hold anguish towards them prior to learning if the information is true or false.
also let s be blunt  angelina jolie looked like lara croft  just have her look like angelina jolie in a t-shirt and work boots and that would literally be lara croft. that is what the movie did.
I agree with a lot of what you said but one thing to take in consideration is that the heavy curves were in part made by the tech limitations  big polygons  no refinement of shapes  etc.
thanks for the video mel. hey you should use that intro... the one that was made for you with the plane  itshould be your signature intro.
imaging having a perfect  unified  foundation with the temple of osiris model  and then deciding to take inspiration from  she-ra  and the crossdressing ben 10 .
there are the real life women that modeled as lara croft in the og to underworld eras. should have just used features similar to them.also you get a sub for having those og lara croft figures at the back.
there is a reason why one of the most popular mods for the latest tomb raider games was replacing the character model with the classic one
I liked the reboot version as well as the old school. well at least the first game of the reboot. she was still attractive. but I d prefer the old school any day of course.edit  totally dont like this new look. the statue could be made better.edit 2  her body proportions are real. old school lara that is. it annoys me that developers say its not real. it is rare but real. I work with models all the time.
I feel like stuff like this will literally stand as a testament to woke cringe that they ll be in denial about when they re no longer pretending that  everything is problematic
in the beginning we had lara croft beautiful  curvy  confident  badass... now we have lara doubtfire  why did they make her look so hard in the face
strong women who think for themselves build up those around them. the strongest women I  know are my mother  sister  and wife. each is a powerful strongwilled thinker who help to make the world a better place. they stand for what they believe in and dont subscribe the systematic corroding of the genders. the future ideal according to woke-ism is ugly  androgynous  and genderless. to that I say a firm no. I want my girls to be girls and my boys to be boys and not have to worry about being either. God gave women curves and appeal for the same reason that he gave guys other assets  to compliment the other. as men and women work together  great things can and do happen.
I really enjoyed the first installment of the reboot.. .sucks that they made her less appealing as time goes onmight as well start casting guys for the role if this is the direction
thatstatue s design is the tomb raider equivalent of that initial design of movie sonic.
that laura looks like she might be able to lift up an engine block but definitely not perform the athletic platform jumps that the games require  so unless they re planning on turning her into a mechanic...
I like how game developers have to make the characters as ugly as they are so they can  relate
lara croft should be portrayed as exceptionally physically fit. she s a master in melee combat  a great hunter  survivalist  and explorer. and yes  she s always been very physically attractive  along with the brains to boot. what s so bad about an intelligent sexy woman  its not like someone is going to build a statue of thor or captain america without a six pack anytime soon.
looks like caitlyn jenner.
in this statue they are giving the same treatment as aloy from the game horizont in which the producers will choose to masculinize the character because they thought that a female face does not convey strength
lol just imagined the turban on  perfect.
@tarektechmarine
she was curvy in her concept arts drawn with pencil and paper too  and was deliberately made to be curvy.
@melonie mac go boom  interresting  thanks for the info melonie    I would like to see those drawings if you have some links... for science  p keep going with the channel  great energy and transparency !
I think one of the only good recent examples of a strong woman would be the roscoe character in reacher on prime. she s a badass female officer who is plenty feminine.
never knew lara had a twin brother
I cant quite put my finger on it  but I really liked this episode.  gonna rewatch 7 00 - 11 05 again to see if I can figure it out.
we wanted lara croft and we got abbey but what do I know  p
damn...she s fine. mel Imean  not transexual lara croft.
Im with you when you say that you want a stronger looking lara... but how would you be able to see her power from thatstatue where she is wearing all those clothes
without a body positive laura croft there will never be true representation.  this is a joke. I just like the idea of anything she tries to climb or swing from collapsing.
I wouldn t know that was lara unless you told me. and even then I d be like ... no she isn t.
thats not a statue of lara croft! thats yoshikage kira going through some kinda phase.
0 59 the nathan drake lookalike at the secon image always gets me
the defeminization of  female characters is getting way out of hand.
va issues aside  this is why I love bayonetta. femme fatale to the nth degree  super extra to always whoop ass in style  sometimes her quips and dramatic kills fall flat for comedic value  she has a caring side but can be uncooperative as well.if she got a western woke version  I shudder to imagine what it d look like.they d probably remove her glasses for  realism ...yeesh...
let s hope they re considering everything youre saying in this for the new tr they announced  today.
looks like the gym teacher in the first scary movie
keep spittin the truth  girl! big fan.
I swear if thats next gen lara Im so done.
I really appreciate the time we spent admiring beautiful fitness models
I randomly came across this video  and Im smitten  -  you speak the truth. God bless you.
is that a statue of lara croft  it looks more like marilyn manson to me. by the way  lara doesnt necessarily has to look realistic because she s a video game character  nothing more  nothing less.
Ive given up on crystal or whoever is in charge of lara s design  they just dont get it. they can dress her up in the classic attire  give her her dual pistols and braid back but she ll still look like a cosplayer and not the lara croft. maaann I hate the fact they wont just forget the awful survival mess happened and instead try to taint the classic games with that abomination
thats because you need to put all 5 fingers on it. with a tight grip and gentle up and down motion. thats what I did.
shorts and a tank top are not bulky attire and do not hide strong curves
classic tomb raiders are always the best ones I keep playing them over and over again the things went downhill after tomb raider angel of darkness with the very public break up of core and edos.
I think youre on the same level of looks as lara.
I really hope thats not the lara they have in mind for the abridged sequels
can we talk more about the fitness models please
youre incredibly based  Im subscribing.
it looks like they mashed abbie and ellie from tlou2 together into 1 statue.
thatstatue actually makes me think of thor from the latest marvels avengers disaster for some reason.
wow  looks like a young nathan drake with a bra on!nathan drake  hey  sully... remember that time I had to pose as a woman sully  yeah  hiding those scandinavian coins in the padding of that bra really did the trick!nathan  to think the guards were looking at the coins the whole time...
oh shoot  its the new larry croft game
so reboot laura not having the curves has a lot to do with motion cap and her looking like a college student made sense  as she was a college student. she also lost a lot of her confidence because the reboot was because it was before she was a badass. you literally see the first time shes ever killed someone and she didnt even get to let any of thatsink in. havent gotten to finish the second or start the third reboot so I wont speculate on those. I liked reboot lara  it was the lara but I think it made a good origin story  even if it was a rebooted one. generational gaps between standards makes sense. that all being said  yeah new new lara looks wonky. I saw the core of the problem the other day with a video talking about bisexuality in video games where they said having the option to be by isnt as representative of a legitimately bisexual or gay character. they dont just want the option of being able to act how you want and the developer saying this character is strictly this. first it was we dont see it in games  and now its the devs dont shove it down our throat in games. which is what they want. first they wanted more game freedom now they want less freedom for more representation.
and in the back of my mind  Im hearing the song  dude looks like a lady .I thought it was a stupid title  so long ago - I didn t know it was the description of nightmares to come. -d
Imean  we dont even know if she s gonna look like that in game. its just a statue. just chill  cd knows how to create a decent feminine character. I personally think rise lara was really gorgeous.
thatstatue looks more like nathan drake than lara croft...
I dont know what it is about your youtube thumbnail that you put on all your video images  but it catches my eye every time and Imust click on it. just a head on a plane. so funny to me!
I really enjoyed the latest 3 games and the new realistic design for lara. but this statue... what the hell
am I the only one that thinks thatstatue looks like eric stoltz cosplaying lara croft
will it include a code skin from original  polygonal lara
this is lawrence croft. the   reimagining
2 50   faster then a speeding bullet  more powerful than a locomotive. able to reach tall buildings in a single bound...  that is superman right
great video and you made so many great points
haha thank you!
you know what s also strange about thatstatue  there are no guns inside her holsters.
I will confess I did enjoy the 2013 reboot and rottr even more. they lost me at sottr  though. regardless  I always find myself revisiting tr4  my favourite tr ever  and underworld. by the way  Im watching this in 1080p and - oh  boy! does thatstatue look hideous or what
she looks like the lara from the mobile temple run inspired game
even though Im not religious. I appreciate the Bible talk because I can see it gives you so much strength plus so many others in this world.
time for us real fans to complain loud enough that we get og lara back. worked for sonic.
Im threatened by thatstatue. seriously  that thing scares the shit outta me!
I really liked the 2013 reboot  I never had the systems to play the earlier games so this pc release was the perfect place to enter the story as reimagined for a modern audience.  I thought the first game was one of the best origin stories I have ever played - youreally felt lara s struggle and saw her evolve into a more self-actualized person by the end.  I felt like her appearance merely changed to make her look like a maturing person  who had grown a little between each adventure.
thatstatue of lara looks like a guy from  my high school basket ball team.
you did some really solid research there.
watched simpcast. tswg is annoying. you are legitimately cool.  cant say I have ever said that before about a woman.  look forward to the daily quotes.  nina is awesome.
thats not lara croft. its abby croft.
melonie  the Bible tells me not to judge.the book of judges  am I a joke to you
this version of lara looks like the new version aged by 30 years and gender swapped the villain on james cameron s avatar
unified ! will there be another remake
without her guns it just isn t lara croft.  even if they softened her features.
even crazier  why did they take away her guns     but keep the holsters for some reason  I guess they were worried the guns might  trigger  someone.
0 54  they are trying to make her more realistic  not masculine. I guess the underworld muscles are still missing. and she can still be feminine.4 35  according to old chinese medicine  the stereotyped feminine body happens when woman  accepts maternity   her breasts increase  as well as her butt hip  and her shoulders shorten. I dont know if several exercises  grabbing things  would force shoulders to be larger  but she would has more muscles for sure  compared to reboot   at least at a little exposure level  underworld promo . so the 1st body was not wrong - if she wasn t feminist. 6 12  as I said  the curvy body is meant for maternity  and the athletic more masculine  for exercises  which was a man thing ever since. however  I do believe its possible to conciliate both  according to some kind of rare examples.4 52  this is awful! Ive a theory about that  but... no  she hasn t to be like that  period. this came from a trial game  they didn t know if it would be approved. just awful personality to has in a game.6 46  human barbie took 6 ribs off to get that waist  https   www.mirror.co.uk news weird-news watch-human-barbie-doll-who-69102378 30  waist and breast are about the same. but lara statue is ready for action  so she needs to  get less beauty . 9 00  well  I guess most men dont feel attraction for women like that  and being majority  they had to  reduce  lara. 10 52  Im sure most men would say she is embracing masculinity - I disagree at some level.
you cant call someone  fragile  when youre worked up over a fucking statue
on top what s already mentioned in the video  I reckon that the biggest issue thatsculpture has  when it comes to portraying a human female  is head size and shoulder width her head is just too tiny in relation to the rest of her body. males are usually portrayed that way  not females.
wow!  beauty  brains and faith!  you may be one of the bravest and truest ppl Ive seen on yt...
every time I see thatstatue  I get flashbacks to every female junior high and high school gym teacher I ever had. shudder
that ending is so powerful! the more you seek God  the more that God s will finds its way into our lives.all I wanna do is live my life in such a way that hopefully just hopefully Jesus and God will be even remotely proud of me. I like to live my life in a way that when I get to  heaven  Jesus will say  you did a good job  matthew  thats all I want out of my whole life. took me a long time and a lot of misfortune and bad choices to get to the point of reaching out to God and finally finding my way to truly living out the teachings of Christ to the best of my abilities. sorry if thats rambley   been a long day at work on very little sleep.
my gahd. even lara isn t safe from these weirdos.
remember the good old days I picked up the first tomb raider only for the cover. dont even know if I beat it  was young. I did beat anniversary and lara was athletic yes  but she wasn t strong enough to beat up dudes abby style. women represent beauty  men represent strength.
I have been playing tomb raider since day 1   kate beckinsale should be the guide for what lara should look like.  in my opinion.
thatstatues face looks like a young david bowe  the british rocker.
yours is lara croft. mine is batman. batman is a man who reached ultimate human physical and mental fitness. batman is my inspiration for striving to be my ultimate best in everything.
thatstatue looks the  its ma am  dude.
hey  mel! Im far away from the tomb raider as you can get  but the topic is interesting. question  which version of the Bible is best for a beginner  Im an atheist  but recently became intrigued with religion. cheers from russia!
why does lara have empty holsters on the statue smh I guess they might offend someone if she had guns.another great video thats why I didn t buy the 2nd or 3rd game because she looked completely different.
the statue s face looks like a young david bowie.
Im not a hard core fan of tomb raider  but I had a lot of fun with the last three games. I just love adventure games like tomb raider and uncharted games. that being said the original design of laura is better!
this is great commentary!  not just on lara croft  but on the Bible too!  Jesus shed his blood for everyone!  so  if we follow him  we should show love and respect...to everyone!   -
I hope you mean it when you say  if this is unified lara count me out some have accused you of being a flip-flopper who will jump on the bandwagon when the game comes out.I hope they are wrong and you will do the right thing and speak with your money and stick by your duel guns
the face on the statue looks more like leon from resident evil.
wow  as a gamer since the 80 s and remembering the first tomb raider games  this is not my lara croft.  its like they used alicia vikander  but made her face more manly.
Im most upset she s missing her pistols .
Im glad for your scripture moments. I have been working on getting back into the word more this year. I have been successful or at least better  but your little tidbits have really helped with that  in a since of community. to share my side for a 2way street  my current plan on daily biblical readings is a 21 day plan of Jesus  parables. today the parable of the pharisee and the tax collector.
this is my criteria for lara croft and tomb raider 1. smokin  2. dual 3. flashy iconic outfits4. sharp wit and tongue5. acrobatic skills6. atmospheric semI linear level design7. prioritize platforming and exploration8. light combat
in 2022  someone can decide that a character is too attractive.
hI nicholas!  d honestly it depends. if you want to know the history side of things then go ahead and start with genesis and go from there in order  but if you want to learn more about Jesus then start with matthew  and if you want to read some uplifting stuff then psalms and proverbs imo. also the youversion Bible app is so good  I definitely suggest it
@melonie mac go boom  thank you! I bought the audio version of king james s Bible. will it be ok as a starting point
Im happy Im a pc gamer and  I just get the lara I want.God bless mods.
Jesus take the wheel! lol that is a horrible look for leonard croft lol. they are ruining what she is. great upload keep em coming!
I think we lingered on the fitness models a tad bit more than required. all in good fun
the classic lara croft is a trademark feminine look  you could   should recognize it immediately. the  new  more masculine version  even from the rebooted games and the new film  although the actress is beautiful  is not lara croft.
she s got that tig-ole-...  hahaha rofl
looks like they took away her pistols too  but kept the holsters.
honestly  I wonder if these people didn t make lara into a teenaged andro boy with a padded bra simply because thats what they fantasize about.
they should cast melonie as lara croft.
melonie should be the new lara croft.
preach!!! I am glad Im not alone in thinking this.
also  thatstatue is more manly than reboot  laura
did anyone else grow up singing titus 3 5 in summer camp
tomb raider for was my first 3d accelerated game. laura looked bad ass rendered at 1024x768.
every lara croft model should just recrearte early 00s angelina jolie
if I hadn t been told thatstatue was of lara croft  I wouldn t have guessed that it was. it is very strange to me how they redesign characters to be  realistic   but actually just make them androgynous. Ive actually met  many women that look very much like the old lara croft. why do they seem to hate narrow jaws  full lips and hips  it is really insulting that markers of femininity are simultaneously seen as undesirable.
I was scared to point out the head was too small on twitter  everyone seemed to love it. but the head is way too small. the entire height should be 8 heads high  but this is 9 heads high
the original lara will always be the best one
you want to see how screwy the lara is in the modern version you dont even need to look at hip to waist  bust or jawline.just look at the hands  then compare them to the hands that are on all of those female bodybuilders. they have made a male lara with breasts for this new one  because those hands are male hands  they re large af.
you know it would be the perfect laura croft  gina carano
right on  well said.
thatstatue  it looks like leon s. kennedy crossplaying as lara.
actually kratos has a nine pack since the second game  when zeus tried to make spartan shish kebab using the sword of olympus.
hey mel love your stuff.  got.a request  since this platform is doing everything it canto  turn youtube into a dumpster fire filled with rotting corpses  would it be possible for you to start up a channel on odysee and post all your vids there
she looks more like abby from tlou2 than croft.
as the critical drinker would say the message!  is more important than fans.
youre the kinda hot thats been literally plucked from a fantasy recess in my brain
love the Bible verses in the videos and your not afraid to give your opinions on stuff
dont bother arguing theology with keyboard warriors  ms melanie  it just makes them want to argue more. I have three degrees in theology   I learned long ago that folks argue more online than in person. take care  be safe    keep sharing Jesus!
oh thats lara  I thought it was a statue of nathan drake!
thank you for sharing God s word. I was on fire for God. big time. till 2012 when my son was killed in a car wreck with his mom and a younger bother not mine. I was mad at God for a long time. hearing you has reminded me what Ive been missing.
if you want a really good example  check out valentina shevchenko  both in fight gear and in a dress. done
thatstatue is yikes. but you didn t like how she looked in the most recent games  I thought she looked smoking hot in them  boom  indeed haha.I am kinda worried about the next games though. I wonder if we ve seen the last of hot lara. I did like the most recent movie but also thought the actress looked nothing like lara. how do you think wokeness will affect future tomb raider games  besides just the looks
Im just my opinion I do like lara s reboot looks mostly  rise of the tomb raider  maybe there s something wrong with me  though I really hated her reboot personality and non-feminine attitude in the reboots and I do prefer her original looks cause its what I remember her when I was a kidhonestly what they could have easily done is giver her the reboot looks  if we didn t have a choice  is add a bit of more muscle tone  introduce more of her feminine and sexy side also give her some gun enthusiasm and that would be a far better recipe but unfortunately the series start to bleed its way into the media s agenda.
mel I told you all the ladies of games will look like abby from tlou2.
is lara pretty..hell yes...but that isn t just why guys loved her..she was strong  driven  kind  and generous. she is a good woman. she had qualities beyond the physical..but here is something else she had flaw..she was too head strong   stubborn at times  single minded at time  so focused on task at hand . I love that they showed this flaw in shadows  when her best friend jonah even had disagreements with her..to include she was so focused on quest jonah had to yell at her to help save people from a disaster . lara loved jonah and he did her and you could see that in the game  brother sister type ...this is why I love lara and her series. also  lara struggled and proved her strengths as she got through series..and she followed in her father s footsteps who she loved dearly.
hImelonie. check out  new tomb raider angelina jolie action figure lara croft statue model kit 33cm   on ebay. its aj but with the classic lara outfit. I think its awesome.
really enjoying your channel! keep it up! any thoughts on martha is dead sony censorship
so glad that game urinalists and developers are here to save the day with unmitigated  meh .
love your content!! subbed!
the romans have figured out how to carve soft features into stone I agree with you melanie this looks like its been carved by an amateur
I have my channel synced on rumble - I will look into odysee as well. thank you!
@melonie mac go boom  ok  I ll look into that. thanks.yt has me hooked to such a degree that I actually think its a pain in the butt to go look for other sites.
I think she s pretty in the reboot games  but she doesnt look  or act  like lara croft by any stretch
@melonie mac go boom  how so  I didn t play the older games.
apparently  they replaced lara with a 17-year-old german boy.
thats... a horrifying redesign. actually horrifying. how canthey slip so far
its crazy they have to do this to every female character but no one is telling women to stop butchering themselves to look like video game characters.
it is absolutely on purpose that they made her look like this  the gender bending trend is really strange d
they also want to get rid of all of their real and loyal fans so they can replace them with their woke fanbase  regardless if it completely destroys the art they ve taken over.same thing happening all around hollywood and disney with franchises like marvel and star wars. they dont care if they ruin the franchise as long as it promotes their politics and woke agendas.
this is they them lara for a new age.
loved original tomb raider... I thought angelina jolie was the perfect person to play her in the movies. thatsaid... I honestly didn t mind alicia vikander playing her either!
its a reverse version of  dude looks like a lady.
tomb raider was my first favorite game on the playstation console  and I have loved it ever since  once considered my favorite game of all time the recent editions have lost my interest a bit though.
I totally agree with your opinion
the og lara would shot the face off thatstatue... she was such a bad ass
as someone who has walked that length of pavement around camden lock for many many years  Im suprised thatstatue wasn t kicked into the road. thats literally right by the entrance to an extremely busy market  having walking space taken up by that is just not cricket
lara croft - the unobtainium of female main characters.I like it.
nice to see honest opinions and not just the self-censored political correct bs we have been dealing with for the past decade.
ironically  the people who say being fat is healthy would look at those fit women  and shout  thats not healthyyyyy!
thanks for the advice. as Christians we strive for perfection. but we will not achieve it here on earth. God bless you! keep sharing the scripture.
I really doubt most people find androgyny sexy. if anything most people are probably turned off by it. I would imagine thatsales of these games are going to drop as time goes on. either the developers will get a grip and give people what they want or they will just be ideologues and blame the consumer for their failures. considering the current state of hollywood and the gaming industry I figure it will probably be the second one.
that look should be laura craft when she s 15 years old
original lara was a bit too cheesy for me  but I did really like one from reboot  first game. but then things got worse. both in terms of gameplay and model. while all models were reasonably attractive  one from first game was best. I have no idea why they had to change design with every game  it did not improve anything in the slightest. and the same happened with games themselves  like they just could not figure out and settle with one of anything  be it model or gameplay. first game looked good  played well and setting were amazing dat fucking battleship at ship graveyard . second did some things better  but others much worse having killrooms as part of game design is an extremely bad idea  and basically just rehashed first game  with very little innovation deathless ones are basically same thing as stormguard  even sections where you play against them feel eerie the same  and originality. and third followed same course  some things better  others got worse. in third game they drastically improved every aspect related to firefights and there was almost no engagements. like what to fuck ! ! ! they clearly spent a whole half an hour on enemy aI  so when you do get into engagements  on very rare occasions  they clearly follow very basically scripted paths.instead of establishing title with first game and building up from there  fixing what needed fixing  they kept on experimenting  with no good reason and fairly poor results. and it applied to every aspect of game  from lara looks to gameplay mechanics to lore. with end result being fairly mixed  with last game  imho  being actually worse than first one. I have replayed first game 3 times by now  but I had to force myself to finish second and even left third one for several months alone half-way thru  before returning and finishing it.and yeah  this statue does not look good. maybe if it was painted  it could be rectified  but...it kinda has all the right parts in right proportions  but as a whole it does not look good.as far as original lara assets go  due to mistake during development her boobs turned out to be twice the size it was planned...and they just went with it.
larry croft looks great
to be fair  the statue does have a lower cut top than the original lara wore. just saying. I kind of get what you mean  but I didn t really have a problem with the lara in the new games. she was more gritty  she felt more real and  I have to say  as I am british  she looked more british whereas the original lara looked like she belonged on venice beach to me  lol. I still felt new game lara 100  retained her feminism though  she was still sexy and her  lack of confidence  was simply because it was an origins story and she would obviously have started off less confident than she ends up after a few years. also  some of this is down to in game graphic improvements. back with og lara if you wanted to graphically display your character as female you kind of had to exaggerate certain features or else you would not see the difference. I feel that graphics are so good now you dont need to do that at all and if you did graphically reproduce og lara it would risk looking like beshine the action hero  if you dont know beshine  look her up . I am maybe being a little over the top with that but the point stands that exaggerated features dont always look good. all that being said  I am 100  with you with thatstatue. I am hoping it is just another example of those wtf statues which keep appearing  cristiano ronaldo  lmao  and not emblematic of her  new look .
yeah... thatstatue is terrible. I completely agree that it does look like a young boy s face body. when you compared the fitness models to the statue there is absolutely no competition. the models are exactly what lara croft should look like. beautiful and feminine but also strong and confident.
I am really liking your new channel  mm.
melanie  I think you and certain number of our fellow believers are talking past each other.  they believe that being a city on a hill means taking stands against sin.  hopefully  they believe that confronting sin will convict hearts and lead them to Christ.let me give you an example  for this is the situation that you are in. there were two Christian celebrities were asked a certain question about certain sinners.  both times this question was an ambush on secular platforms  each had opposing views.  they both have different reactions  depending on the group you asked.  and everytime this plays out in public I feel something is missing. Christians dont understand how to express the danger of sin  or dont know the dangers of sin  without condemning people. we have to know definitions and relations in a  cohesive manner  1 how define sin is anything thatseparates us from God.  2  who is God is the source of life 3  anything separated from God dies.4  sin is why we die.hope this encourages you  if you see it.
damn melonie mac is savage
john 3 17 always gives me comfort   for God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world  but to save the world through him.   I love lara for her strength  resilience  intelligence  cleverness  and savoir faire. her looks are a bonus. just subbed. jeremy says hello.
that  go boom indeed  comment u read made me think of that michelangelo  cowabunga  meme..and I could so see u taking a fitting pic of urself and captioning it as  go boom it is  ......annd on a more personal note  I rly appreciate ur Bible verses bcoz despite being atheist I want to believe and hearing those and ur commentary on them helps
as austin powers would say   thats a man  baby!
I bet you get more love for this take then hate. you earned my sub the last few days. keep it up  keep telling the truth when we got your back done  unfortunately we re a bunch of sexist pigs . but loyal sex is pigs
I enjoy your video. keep it up.
Im afraid I dont understand  how s she andogynous though I do wish they d lean into her being a feminine power fantasy again. I always thought she was that originally  but I also dont think that can be achieved with a unified timeline.
keep speaking the truth from lara fans... its sad to see such an iconic female character get turned into ideologic propaganda.
Im getting mixed messages here  how is she supposed to be logically possible  but also unobtainable  isn t the point thatshe s supposed to be a role model physically
I agree  that really doesnt look like lara croft. the hair is shorter in the front and the face looks totally unrecognizable. as someone who only played a few of the ps1 tomb raiders  I am not loving all of the newer reiterations of lara. itseems like lara hasn t been lara since the cradle of life movie. angelina jolie did a great job of playing on lara s confidence  bravery and badass sass. I dont know enough about the more recent games to say how much her personality has shifted from that persona  but her look is totally different. I think the lara I knew looked in her early 30s and the newer style looks like she s in her early 20s  has a much lighter hair color and looks like she has a different heritage than being english. she looks drastically different.
seems like you had a lot of love for this video.
romans 3 23 for all have sinned  and come short of the glory of God. great words in the vid. keep it up
at least nintendo is keeping samus as an attractive  badass female character and not allowing her to be androginized to please the spiteful.
what about when angelina jolie played lara croft.  are they gonna say thats an impossible build too oh God that woman with the maria guexia     short.  those legs.   3
see where youre coming from but dont think she looks that androgynous. her body type reminds me how jennifer aniston used to look in a bikinI in the 2000s in all the shots paparazzI got of her. some people said that about her too but she was just fit and well built. part of her greek heritage.on the other hand you have something like keira knightley in king arthur or natalie portman in your highness when they do show a lot more skin but are thinner like what was the trend of the 90s and 2000s. they absolutely still looked feminine while being able to have that vibe of being a badass. but some people complained that the body type looked anorexic and it was unrealistic to see them in those roles taking down big dudes.angelina jolie was somewhere in the middle and maybe someone like alexandria dadarrio. she would be able to pull off that body type more than alicia vikander.Im happy to see the tank top and short shorts again but not sure they could have pleased everyone. the statue should have been stylized because thats what she always used to be in the pinup posters of gaming mags instead of realistic. the new look is just the same model with a modern day remake of the old attire. its what should have been in all the reboot games but is not some big jump away from that character model.
I edited the face to see how this statue would look like  can you check your ig dms    would love to know what do you think about it
classic lara wore lower tops  just not in the first game. the undershirt is dumb  her top isn t even low on this statue.
hugs thanks so much girl  Im happy you appreciate my verses I share too  3
you know  I enjoyed both the classic and reboot tomb raider games. the reboot ones  I kinda see them as like a  coming of age  type of trilogy for lara in those games. I do remember in one part of the game where lara actually snaps and we see that lara we know before where she just goes  fuck it  youre gonna give me a hard time  I ll do it right back . the thing was  is thatshe was fresh out of college university  or still in college university cant remember  so her being less like her old self made sense in a way  since we re seeing her from when she first started out. then it ll transition into her becoming the woman we knew her as when she was first introduced. but I gotta say  what the hell is thatstatue  the facial features remind me of a version of scott ryder from mass effect andromeda that I created.
dont kid yourself about the viability of portraying soft and or feminine features in sculpting or statuary  d the anime industry has been giving fans and collectors wet dreams for ages with their figurines and such.
the next tomb raider laura gonna have a buzz cut and flannel shirt
the sad part is whoever designed this trainwreck probably put it in their portfolio
my grandmother had a masculine face but when she was younger her body at least was very feminine. I dont understand why they d make women look like that.
they did same bullshit with chris redfield in re5 and other res  he suddenly became a bodybuilder full of muscles. Imiss skinny chris redfield in re1
they made her whiny  depressing and morose. nobody who does the shitshe does is so self absorbed and pathetic.the world should of been made to fit lara  not the other way round. she d be approaching mario levels of iconic if they d done her right and kept her fun ott.
once you found out the key combination for the hand stand ..ofoofffff!
I tell ppl all the time  look at the world. see how everyone is at each other s throat  they typically say yes. I tell them thats a world without God. and imo this only gets worse the more we run from that truth. I also tel ppl  I am not a judge  cop  on jury  or the God himself. I do not judge  that is the above job. I can only give my two cents if asked. the last 3 4 years Ive been solo working on myself. fighting temptations. in this time I can easily say I am better off. connection is stronger and I feel more content. I didn t see the end coming with the Bible verse. I appreciate you using your platform to help guide  not push  ppl in the right direction. I do believe because some were so heavy handed ppl turn their heads and walked away from their faith. I know the big man upstairs has to appreciate it too. thank you!
I love how you add Bible verses and faith-based educational moments into your videos! I do have a question though. when it comes to not judging others  when is it the appropriate time to give your opinion as a Christian about how someone acts  the things they do  and so on if they themselves are a fellow Christian but we believe something they re doing goes against our faith God s law  I agree that we should not judge and condemn others  for who are we to do so  but shouldn t there be a point where we inform them of where we believe they re wrong  is there a point where we should inform them of when they may stray from the path God has set for us or make choices that might displease God I hope I worded my question correctly. thank you so much for the videos and time and effort spent on them! blessings on you!
its worth noting that the original creators hated much they sexualized lara croft  and just accepted it as a necessary evil so people could play as a female protagonist.
lara croft  becomes indiana jones.
my favorite part about americans is how we think we know better than all of human history and modern human civilization  while relentlessly proving the opposite to be truebeauty has been the muse of artists creators thinkers since the literal dawn of time  and sure  beauty is subjective  but women and the female form aura being role have been a massive part of history and art alike  its so fucking dumb to try and fly in the face of that because we re not comfortable with that anymore. this new effort to erase femininity is actually insanewe got so caught up in being the world s moral authority and the pinnacle of  progress   that we accidentally flipped the switch from  progress  to  regress   and it never stops getting more embarrassing
I agree so much with this that I had to  subscribe
I really need to play the sequel to the reboot game. loved the reboot. now  I was beyond pissed about what they did to her in the damn movie. that was disrespectful. but that unfortunately  is how they ve handled the franchise. great game followed by a watering down of things. wokeness doesnt help. not a surprise after what has been done to female figures across the medium.
melonie mac I really like what you said about JesusChrist fulfilling the laws of God  ...like if JesusChrist was like  I am the law  that reminds me of how good God truly is and the blessings God gives us the children  when I start college I plan to go into graphic design I want to design myself with my crown and angels wings for videography  I like games like fable and with my creations and new graphics I hope to inspire the gaming industry for some really cool realistic graphic games with extreme realism and magical open worlds. I love you melone mac and with my future success I will support you with awesome gifts. I am a mississippI boy that grew up in california  I like texas and melonie mac go boom is a super nova I believe in you melonie mac you are perfect
is it me or does the new lara croft remind you of handsome jack from borderlands
just look up ifbb bikinI fitness and you can see the possibility of bodies that are very feminine but is physically active. just because a woman works out they automatically get a manly body.
ha! that unified lara croft version looks like one of those final fantasy male characters or korean pop male singers performers.
underworld was last tr game I liked lara  clasic was and is best tr1-5  d
I dunno thats a tough one. imo it depends on how close you are to the person and what they re doing. I recall reading something recently in the Bible about gently guiding our brothers and sisters if they veer off path  but back away if they dont want to listen. I need to look into it though  Im just paraphrasing from memory.I imagine it would be similar to how you d talk to  help a close friend if they were like an addict or something- its something you d want to approach gently.
@melonie mac go boom  right! Im just a little confused on how to do one without doing the other  and I feel like it d be sort of a thin line between the two. I really appreciate the response though  thanks!
dear melonie chan... you said  idk if its hard to make softer parts of the statue  but my friend... I d like to refresh your memory about our ancient stone masons .... -the ancient egypt stonework that you still cannot fit a paper  between its blocks -gaetano cellinI   humanity against evil- the rape of proserpina  by gian lorenzo bernini- ugolino and his sons  by jean-baptiste carpeaux-lace fabric carved solid marble stone- nymph  detail  giovannI battista lombardI  marble  1864-marble portrait of the co-emperor  lucius verus - the west wind  by thomas ridgeway gould-michaeangelo   david   1501-1504 -gaetano cellinI   humanity against evil- the rape of proserpina  by gian lorenzo bernini- ugolino and his sons  by jean-baptiste carpeaux-lace fabric carved solid marble stone- nymph  detail  giovannI battista lombardI  marble  1864-marble portrait of the co-emperor  lucius verus - the west wind  by thomas ridgeway gould
the face looks  like some of those male characters from japanese cgImovies such as  final fantasy or resident evil.
I wasn t really allowed to play video games as a kid even though I always liked them  and I credit tomb raider 2013 with turning me into a gamer. I love reboot lara  and I do think it would be a good thing if women in games generally were allowed to be more like real women  in personality and appearance. I dont think a woman needs to justify her existence by being a barbie adjacent supermodel. some women are less attractive  some are less feminine  and I dont think you shouldn t be able to create a character like that.however  the goal of the entertainment industry is ironically not to make women more representative of real women. its to make them like men  while also weakening and destroying men--why do you think nathan drake got downgraded to boyish tom holland  . they want to erase both masculinity and femininity so I know their intention behind first making lara look more  realistic  but still beautiful was not good.I think reboot lara is still feminine  and still a good representation of a woman--after all they first rewrote her character a decade ago so the woke madness wasn t in full swing yet. but I certainly dont trust what they ll start doing with her going forward  especially if this atrocity to God  uh Imean statue  is any indication.
he looks like dmitry from that animated anastasia movie
and on an unrelated note  they should ve gotten you to do the g4 revival. if Im a simp for saying this  so be it.
I never noticed how much they progressively nerfed her feminine traits until you put the 3 variants of her from the new video game trilogy on screen. but thatstatue is a huge jump. itstraight up looks like a dude.
you should look up lara weller  one of the women who was a lara croft model.
I thought this statue was supposed to be a transgender link.  if you hadn t told me it was supposed to be lara croft  I would never have guessed.
looks like david bowie more than lara croft.
I am used to having unpopular tomb raider opinions as angel of darkness is one of my fav tomb raider games.
I think your way off on this being androgynous. also this looking like a 14 year old boy is way off. the only thing I agree with is that the design has been changed to make the sexual characteristics drastically toned down from the original. Im not attached to the original design like you are cause it looks really cartoony. Im more fond of the designs from underworld through the reboot in 2013. even the example of the more feminine model you showed has very similar proportions to the statue. the biggest thing with the statue that pulls it away from the conventional lara croft is thatshes not as slender and is filled out a bit more. I d even say this is sexier than the newest design from shadow of the tomb raider.
what  you dont want a  handsome  lara croft
these are a few thoughts on what I think Ive had the privilege of learning about scripture.for most of my life I have read the Bible as if I were being addressed personally to the point where itsubtly felt like I was the main character of the scriptures. thats what I call a regression of mindset. its his story. Jesus Christ is the main character. he is the beginning and the end. and when youread that he came to fulfill the law  some thoughts came to my mind. of course  he s the only one worthy and entitled to fulfill his own law!  the pharisees probably thought he came to abolish the law because they didn t understand Jesus Christ. but unlike them  or anyone else  he fulfilled the law. he is worthy of praise  on his throne  forever and ever. the author of existence delves into his own story to meet his created characters. of course  I am not completely distancing myself from scripture  according to what I wrote above.  but I pay close attention to who says what to whom and take things to heart so that I can refresh my thoughts  my inner self  every day. oh  and yes... what we also often forget is that judging goes both ways.  we usually only want to be judged positively or we often only want to judge others negatively.  when Jesus Christ says  do not judge  does he mean  do not judge in a positive way   too   to put it on point  some we throw into heaven  others we throw into hell.  whether it will be the new world or hell  both are in the hands of the most high.p.s. I love your Bible talk and appreciate you! Im binge watching the  melonie goes boom  videos right now. its a regular sunday and it feels like Imissed these videos.p.p.s  one does not simply walk into middle earth to claim the crown and throne of aragon.
you look more like lara croft than the new  tomb raider
this makes me think to doom  the new games went back to the roots of hyper masculinity and it is awesome.  they want to bring everything to be the same and bland. we had awesome games of the 90s  doom  duke nukem   wolfenstien  tomb raider  diablo. they make new games and ruin them trying to make it more modern. they have all the tools to make the game with even better worlds and make them harder but instead dumb down the characters  make games easier  more instructions. what ever happened to sitting there for hours trying to figure out how to get past something without having instructions on the screen but instead finding clues in game.  is it just me or does anyone else get upset when they get a new game  play it on the hardest difficulty and beat it in 6 hours with only a few deaths  I want to struggle and be frustrated because its so much more rewarding when you finally overcome it.  wow that got a long way from de-feminizing lara.
people in current year think thatstrong women should look more and act like the very men they despise. its like they simply cannot fathom that women can be both beautiful and skilled at the same time. how does making a woman into a man empower women
what on earth  thatstatue looks like a fridge with pecs
there s psychos from both side of the coin  not just the reboot ones. I pretty much got branded a sadist for appreciating the newer design on the statue shown which apparently means Im against femininity and everything classic lara. I was tagged misogynistic because I dont mind lara having a bulkier physique. the tr fandom is toxic af from all corners and Im over it.
I actually really like the design of that new lara croft..but not as lara croft
honoring lara croft with a david bowie   thin white duke period no less  plaster statue   progressive af and gg 2.0 repellent
I know of all the models - Ive been in the tr community for over 2 decades now. lara weller is my favorite of them all
says the statue isn t androgynous.then says the statue s sexual characteristics have been drastically toned down.what.
oh neat  a tomb raider   last of us crossover where abby plays lara... awesome... epic... fun... hilarious how a stick figure of polygons with a couple of triangles  created thirty years ago  can be more feminine than this...
am I the only one that thinks it looks like tim roth s characters from pulp fiction   reservoir dogs  at least in the face and hair.
looks like a ma am from tlou2 is making her rounds.
I dont think there s an opportune time to ever talk about this on another person s yt channel  so I ll just do it.its so absurd that lara croft is not in super smash bros. not in any capacity  yet there are 4 other square enix characters that are playable. cloud strife and dragon quest s hero were the only two rational choices of the 4. sephiroth and sora pander to the same fanbase that cloud does  so they dont make the kind of money that the nintendo bubble thinks they do. you can make the next character a rag on a stick from botw and the same fandom would be so excited for it  the big difference being that the stick wouldn t require upfront costs beforehand. I get that you dont follow smash bros  but without question had lara been there  it would certainly intrigue you and many tomb raider fans to spend  60 to  260 apiece for it in the form of hardware and software sales  not just  6 dlc sales. tomb raider is square enix s 2nd most successful franchise and apparently lara s biggest mistake was not wield a sword and style her hair in a certain way.I honestly dont see how sora is going to break even  considering this is a character that needed the cooperation of two companies  one being the mouse  in addition to his supporters already having been won over years ago. if there s a character that isn t obviously marketable  sakuraI always has a convenient excuse for its inclusion other than to just admit its what he personally wanted. he s convinced his audience that nintendo executives are the ones who just want to pour their own hard-earned money down a bottomless pit. we can easily tell when companies and executives lie to their customers but sakuraI can manage to avoid the scrutiny  simply because he happens to share mutual interests with the nintendo bubble. its a shame there is not enough influence to go around to call sakuraI out for his large ego. please share us your thoughts  if you will.
lower the mcboom! I agree with you that we should not judge others as to if they will go to heaven or not  God is the only judge of that. have a great day and keep mcbooming your thoughts.
is david bowie the new lara
wait thats real  noooo. why cant they just go for a more stylized look. we dont need to make every western type game look realistic.
if 10 years ago to tell a western woman that a beautiful and slender woman is insulting  she would just not understand what it was about and most likely would have thought that you were drunk.
a pre-teen boy wearing a padded bra is a perfect description. I guess they never saw any of the ancient greek statues of the Goddesses. all they had to do was add a couple of holsters and boom  they got it.
to be honest the statue kinda reminds me in some ways of the very early concept arts for the first 1996 tomb raider  the difference being the boobs being larger and the waist smaller. I actually think this is a very interesting look for lara. the fact its a statue is also very deceptive. one such example is the statue of liberty  her face doesnt look very  feminine  in a really delicate way  but if you google pictures of the woman that inspired it  her face was definitely that of a very beautiful and feminine woman. I understand your viewpoint but I think you might be jumping the gun too quickly. I see this statue as a step in the right direction after we had to put up with lara in rags and with racoon hair for almost 10 years now hahahaps  I do wish the waist would be just a bitsmaller  I think it d really tie the whole look in so much better tbh
I remember the original lara croft model shots by core design she was pretty feminine
I see you melonie. just casually flexing those guns at the start of the video. loving the inclusion of the Bible at the end of each video. it is refreshing.  judge not  that ye be not judged. for with what judgement ye judge  ye shall also be judged.
you should play lara croft. feels appropriate. and I think you d look the part.
in the content of scripture  dont judge  means dont assume you know everything in someone s heart and dont act as if you knew for certain thatsomeone will be damned or saved. he definitely asks us to call out sin and evil  so to correct our brothers.
amen... its not about what we do or dont do... its about our individual relationship with God. I always say   I can do good things for God all day long and  still  never accomplish the good that God had for me to do. I think about when Jesus healed the man at bethesda. he said to him   get up  take up your bed  and walk. . now  Jesus was well aware that it was the sabbath  and it was against everything that was  holy  for the man to do such work on that particular day... but the man did it  even though he also knew it was forbidden... he wasn t healed because he was a  law-abiding citizen.  he was healed because Jesus saw a need  responded as his father would  and the man had the faith to believe that if Jesus could heal him on that day  of all days  then Jesus also had the authority to ask him to take up his bed and walk and expect that it would be done regardless of the law forbidding it... ... ...  who the son sets free  is free indeed! ... amen
lara croft boy band adventures.
yeaaahhhh I wont be buying the games if this is the route they go.they almost lost me completely after shadow  this would be crossing that line.
at least they didn t go the route on wanting to look  normal  as in out of shape..
I ll never understand why modern feminists hate curves.there is nothing wrong with a lady having curves
while thatstatue could have been far worse  larry croft very much fits the pattern of turning female characters into teenage boys. whether its captain marvel in the comics or the she-ra remake  this is what these weirdos think women should be. its because they are convinced that women can only be powerful respected when they effectively become men. Im sure that mindset also accounts for galadriel re-rolling as a warrior.
just use a more toned angelina jolie from the film or nell mcandrew  the first  real life  lara croft.
personally  I dont mind the redesign in the reboot.  though  Ive only played the first one. the other plots didn t sound interesting  but the statue looks like the knock off lara croft or the off brand version. more resembles a nathan drake style character in aesthetics than a tomb raider. on the larger issue of  uglyifying  female characters I do find it weird that to empower female characters we need to increase their masculinity. seems counterproductive at best and an insult at worst.
larry croft  tomb raider  womb evader .
im right now at the point of not caring about most next gen games and the main reason is characters design  is getting worse and worse.   God bless retro gaming.
its no coincidence that there aren t any popular tomb raider games or movies right now. the beautiful tia carrera had a decent tv show back in the day that was called relic hunter that was a knock off of tomb raider. it was only good because tia carrera was so hot.
dang! who put clothes on the statue of david
I dont have a problem with the statue itself. nothing particularly remarkable about it. thatsaid  I cant take itseriously  as lara croft. there s nothing even remotely close to resembling her in thatstatue except perhaps the outfit. even then  I wouldn t make the connection if I saw the statue.
this lara looks like leon from re.
corinna  cory  everson  ms. olympia 1984-1989. she also played  atalanta  on the tv series hercules  the legendary journeys. a woman who demonstrated peak physical development without losing an ounce of femininity.the degendering of established characters is  at best  sadly amusing...
these people thatsay that classic lara was so unrealistic  have no idea what the game was even about.  oh  sure  the game was totally realistic with the way a girl like lara  who wasn t a cyborg  demiGoddess  or anything that could explain her durability  could unflinchingly tank bullets and other lethal projectiles like they were spit-wads without any visible armor  move giant cubic rocks that are bigger than she is  instantaneously heal herself in the middle of combat  engage in combat that had mutated zombie centaurs that broke out of statues and other monstrosities  including one that was her doppelganger  and thats just the first game.on the subject of her proportions  melmac has already stated in this video thatshe s this rebellious rich girl that plays by her own rules  would it really be beyond the scope of reasoning thatshe could have breast implants.  they wouldn t be the most practical thing for what her rather dangerous hobby is.  if you just think about them being either the toxic silicone ones  the questionable saline ones or the problematic string implants  but one thing that tomb raider had was some sci-fI elements  I remember in tomb raider  chronicles she was fighting dudes in powered armor with laser weapons and evading some kind of bulletproof android .  the implants could be special ones that have medical nanite factories generators that actually could explain her superhuman durability and strength and maybe some other abilities.  in future titles that could be a plot device that could also be the story behind some rpg mechanics where she may enhance parts of her body or give her some new abilities that could bring some mechanics are new to the franchise  I haven t played every tomb raider title so Im not sure if they haven t had mechanics of thatsort before .  so yeah  she could have more of a story behind her appearance than just a mishap in her design that they just decided to roll with.  I probably put an unhealthy amount of thought into why a fictitious game character of the psone era of games has such womanly proportions  but yeah its an idea they could use.  they likely wont because  the nazI wokefen s.s. wont let them.also  good to have a lady youtuber thats both beautiful and has a good head on her shoulders and is bold enough to be an unapologetic believer in God.  as well as being the good kind that practices the meaning of the verse  let he who is without sin cast the first stone  - meaning she doesnt go around judging and condemning people online or elsewhere
my knee-jerk reaction to the thumbnail is    Im david bowie... .
with peace and love I genuinely dont understand what exactly your problem is when most of the fitness models you pulled up literally look exactly like the statue that youre so upset about  they re just in poses that accentuate specific curves and the statue is simply not posed in a similar way. the statue also doesnt have the extra dimension given by makeup  contouring  studio lighting or photoshop. none of the models have a waist smaller than their head or giant protruding boobs or like childbearing hips either when you look at them from the front when they re relaxed  also how are you all up on twitter whining about less curvy smaller chested bodies erasing femininity when youre not curvy or big chested yourself either  is your own body in its natural state woke antI femininity propaganda too  or do you agree that femininity is mainly a performative thing
look amazing everyday
melonie  what game systems do you play  I love the woman s body what do these woke companies dont understand  thats why I love one piece anime fans understand .
abigail shapiro is proof that lara s chest is not exaggerated. small-waisted women with big  perky breasts do exist. lara croft was not supposed to represent everyone. she was supposed to represent the pinnacle.
bloody hell  she looks like abby from the last of us  Christ give her a golf club already  eh.
I dont feel as strongly about this as you do but youre missing something.  its not that they re tweaking the character  they re destroying the character and making a new one and erasing the old one unless you were old enough to realize a change ever happened.  its sad  I wish they d just go make their own characters and respect the old ones but building up a brand new character is hard so... hispanic spiderman  black female iron man   etc... and lara croft gets treated no better.we live in the dumbest of times....
I watch till the end just to hear  go boom   lol also its good to hear the verses  Im not a Christian as such but its interesting to hear wise words.. boom!
I liked the  new  trilogy of games. I actually played them again for free in the epic store. I liked 1st and 2nd lara  3rd game lara is annoying af.
I played the last three games  and always asked   why aren t her muscles more toned    also I asked   this isn t the laura I liked in the earlier games.  where are the damn duel pistols   there were so many things I was missing that I had to give a thumbs down to those games.
personally  I think rise of the tomb raider  the second one   is the best of the trilogy. its the one of the three that I actually replay.
also lara killed a God in tr1 and 4 so like... what human do these people know that can kill a God. putting on pants doesnt equal you become a God slayer
you miss the part where lara croft wasn t supposed to be grounded and realistic. its an ultimate fantasy character. current trend is to erase the fantasy aspect from established characters and make them as bland looking as possible.
@arch  and there are many other ways to address that besides angrily shaming certain body types because thatstuff very quickly translates into real life and as a result gets directed at real people as well. yes the statue looks like a fortnite default skin character but her going on and on about  femininity erasure  on social media and how the statue is a man because it doesnt have big boobs or curves is a ridiculous overreaction on her part. this really isn t the nuanced critique she thinks it is  its just more fodder for weird incels to regurgitate on social media.
oh Im not missing anything  Ive been saying this lol. new lara croft is not the same person - not even close.
@melonie mac go boom   Im thinking back about what you ve said and honestly I think you ve straight up said in detail how they re rewriting her.  maybe youre just being too wordy in it or maybe Im looking for a particular scratch to be itched  I dunno  but there is something in how youre saying it that doesnt come off as quite right its like sean connery vs daniel craig james bond  exactly explaining how its just kind of gross to do that to a character is annoyying
its abby croft!
do not judge lest ye be judged. I too am a Christian that refuses to see one sin over another. do not hate the sinner. hate the sin. it is not for us to judge but to love and be examples of his love on earth. keep the good faith and the good works shall come to you.
holsters on the statue are empty because guns are too scary for the museum  I guess
they re basically turning her into a man with boobs. why cant a woman be both beautiful and strong  and not even strong in a masculine way per say. there is such a thing as feminine strength which is different. why cant female characters have that feminine strength  why do they basically just have to be men with boobs  I find it more demeaning to women to try and ignore and push down those feminine strengths  of course thats just my opinion though.
to anyone shitting on the og lara croft model  1  its a fucking video game  artistic liberty is a thing2  it was the fucking nineties  tech was just not there for  muh realistic body representashuns 3  these games were great
thats not lara croft....thats abby from the last of us 2.
sad to see western countries making female characters look so androgynous  but I suppose its not terribly surprising considering the relativism indoctrination  and how many people dont understand that men and women were made to be equals with different roles strengths
I almost get the sense that they are deliberately trying to blur and or maybe even erase genders nowadays
for sure your point stands  but it is an important distinction  since the Lord himself went out of his way to say about the law and prophets   ...I have not come to abolish them...  really  we cant expect those who dont know Christ to look like him  so it would seem that we should be more concerned with individuals not knowing Christ than we should be on the symptoms of not knowing him. also  youre right about how we re saved. its not that we pray and study the word to be saved  but believers should do because we are saved. weird how we become too busy for God... how can we encourage each other to spend time with him...
at this point let s be glad lara doesnt have a very obvious twig and berries. after all  the woke say men are better women than women are.
thats not laura croft  thats jayne  the hero of canton!!!!   anybody
ok  but it must be said that those muscles are artificial  as well as the male ones  the result of substances that I do not define prohibited or doping  but certainly not created with a diet of food only.therefore the main problem of the gray lara is the respect of the sexual dimorphism typical of the human species. she is an atypical model even if possible  it just doesnt seem very inclusive to me not to use an average model of a woman who is 162 cm and with proportions consequent to the average height.
the only  unification  they re going to get is the fans unified against this new lara croft. its not even lara croft anymore  more like laura kraft
they made lara croft stunning and brave.
Imean  youre right  the developers of the tomb raider video games really want to make lara croft look as masculine as possible  for a feminist agenda that they promote  against the supposed  male gaze . but the examples that you show of photos of real women  Im not sure if they really help your argument either  because these are photos of not only athletic women but also female bodybuilders  and what you call  curves  are actually muscles  these women they are too muscular and what can be more masculine than that  I know that lara is supposed to be a strong woman  and those muscles would make her look very strong  but also quite masculine so....  is that what youreally want  bodybuilder lara  in my opinion  looking like a bodybuilder would also take away your femininity  but thats just me.
looks like a character from the front cover for  last of us 2 .
this is the opposite of feminism  dont be mistaken. Im a feminist myself and I cantell you that feminists absolutely didn t ask for this and are very much against it. this is pure american political correctness  not feminism. what they ve done to lara physically hurts.
its not lara croft  its the tomb raider brand. cultural vandalism. thats david bowie
the saying Jesus died for our sins literally means that to cleanse humanity of their sins he took the punishment for us aka death. as God promised he would not send another flood  to show how much he loved us he had his own son killed. this was humanity s forgiveness and second chance. kinda looks like alot of people squandered it. not me I do my best to live as a good person and will be pleased to accept my judgment and or punishment.
because some people made unified lara looking more masculine  and yeah  not looking very well   doesnt mean they represent feminism. itseems very comfortable to think like that. what you were saying is actually feminist and it was good  because you are trying to defend her classic representation as something valid  what s wrong with a woman looking like a woman  of course.  but hearing you say you aren t a feminist  because of people like this  does lara a disservice.
my point was that Jesus fulfilled the law so we didn t have to  and thats exactly what he did. doesnt mean we shouldn t try not to sin of course  but we cannot live up to the law  nor do we get into heaven based on our own righteousness   and the Bible is exceptionally clear on that.
@melonie mac go boom  sure. I was agreeing. sorry if I didn t explain that very well.
be a shame if some noble young prankster came along and drew a moustache and beard on it
when God talks about not judging  he isn t saying  you shouldn t call people out or call them names  or have an opinion on someone...  Jesus did just that  and called everyone out.when God talk about not judging  he is telling you you cannot pass judgement on other  for that is his job alone. he means you cannot claim or decide whether or not someone is going to heaven or hell.thats the judgement God speaks of... people are more than welcome to speak the truth about what others are doing.
there is a reason they cast freaking angelina jolie to play lara croft and it wasn t her big brain
several female ufc fighters would make an excellent croft model..only thing left out of the statue for the wokies is the d print..
its kind of like if wb replaced henry caville with some skinny manlet  because men having muscles is a bad stereotype of some shit
hey melonie!  tony moro here!  I dig your new channel!  youre amazing!!
love the content! Jesus died for our sins  accept his grace and ye will be saved.
you d make a pretty fine lara croft imo
before watching the vid  I dont really agree with that. the frame seems realistic and is identifiable as a female. also  just because a girl wears pants and does not flaunt her body more is less feminine  hmmm there is no color and it looks stone-like too so a lot of detail is not translated either in terms of the face. I think some reason people who are attached to the old lara want her to insanely curvy and thick with unrealistic body proportion which is her stylization back then but I think the new versions of lara looks like a real woman who works out and goes to the gym. actually  now that I think about it  this seems to be more like a real girl like you melonie.
wouldnt it be nice if everyone would just accept and respect other people s ideas and works. lara croft was created as she was. it wasn t necessary to change it. we should appreciate the works of others and discuss or even critize it  but not go around changing it just because of  feelings   especially if it is not their work to begin with.should I not watch this channel just because Im not religious and there is a Bible verse in it  no ofcourse not. I still appreciate the video and the sentiment that is in thatsection. I dont need everything to be homogenized and everyone think the same  and I definitely wont insist on changing the format of someone else s work just because I think differently. how can anyone actually think like this  the world would be so boring.anyway  I guess this is a roundabout way of me saying I really enjoy your content and Im subbed .
speaking of old lara  the german band  die  rzte  released a video of their song  m nner sind schweine  starring lara...basically beating up the band. its good fun. you might like it.
God is more interested in the spiritual modesty and purity of his followers in my opinion   as he had no problem with adam and eve in the garden  in the beginning  and after we die   all that is left is our spirit.  physical modesty is the creation of humans.
thats lawrence croft... or nathan drake.... depends of what name you like the most.
good that real women are speaking up instead of the people who are antI feminist.   real feminism was embracing females and their sexuality.  allowing women to be sexy and express their female looks and fashion is what the feminist movement used to be about!
20 46 seeing as matthew 7 1 is taken out of context fairly commonly these days  I understand the misunderstanding and misinterpretation. when Jesus says   do not judge   he doesnt mean  do not criticize    instead he means you shouldn t do so hypocritically as he specifies in the next verse that the measure of which you critique others shall also be administered to you  akin to reaping what you sow galatians 6 7-9 and the golden rule read in the preceding chapter . if he meant that criticism is entirely restricted from us  than there d be no reason to instruct us to discern false prophets later in the same chapter in that discernment is a facet of judgement. I suggest reading either the amp  amplified  version or the literal translation since they re much more specified than say the niv or the king james. not to mention more accurate and closer to the original manuscripts.
the new laracroft looks like squall from ffviii.
you ain t getting no hate from me. you are entitled to your opinion. I do agree with you. lara is a woman and she look feminine and curvy.
looks like the kevin smith version of teela from netflix motu- especially the hair and face
unified  lara croft is peak generic  action adventure female character . and you know the worst part  that is the face of the future. a character that lacks personality or any offensive trait.
the reason woke leftists go after lara croft so hard is because it disproves everything they stand for. they say strong female characters are underrepresented in games and movies when thats never been true. they take well established franchises and gender swap them instead of producing their own ips.tomb raider created a new franchise to rival indiana jones  with a strong female character and made itsuccessful  thats no good for their narrative  so they take a successful established franchises like indiana jones and replace any straight  white or male lead character with one from whichever minority group they are currently politicizing. they actually hate successful franchises with strong women  they d rather sabotage anything ordinary people like about them  turn them into a flop  and then blame it on the  patriarchy  and  misogynists  to advance their narrative.
lol yeah Ive seen it  p
no hate from here  I agree with u on this  and not even tomb rider fan but seen the movies and played 3th game on ps1 long time ago
I dont know  if dudes actually looked like that  I dont think there s a single adult I wouldn t be attracted to. just looks like a lady to me. I agree its not the ideal direction for the character at all  but just looking at this as a depiction of a person  its just a regular woman. the issue is that lara isn t just a regular woman  thats it.
the statue looks more like abby from last of us 2.
there is a good passage in the Bible where Jesus came to them after his resurrection and they asked what will we do when you leave us. Jesus says follow my father s commandments and I have one of my own. love each other as I love you.
I dislike the new tr  since legend  and new lara  since 2013  though Im not a huge fan of her characterization in lau trilogy either .since 2013  her looks became bland and uninspiring  as her sex-appeal is  well  just not there  her personality is somewhat repelling  considering her constant self-doubting and whining and crying and daddy-issues etc.. and even since legend  the games suck more and more with every new  addition  to the tr franchise since legend.tr1  tr3 and traod lara iterations were the best  imho.
I got a kick out of the fact that the statue has empty holsters. are people really threatened by stone pistol butts that cant be removed  or maybe those are iphone cases on her hips
it is so refreshing to see people talking about Christianity since at the end off the day without Christianity we would not have the good things in society that we have today.
I love the picture of 1st generation video game lara croft smoking a big cigar. that picture must have made the snowflakes heads explode  lol.
when Christ said to judge not  he was talking about hypocrisy. like an alcoholic cant judge and or rebuke another alcoholic and such.so ultimately when it comes to judging others it depends on where your heart and motivation is.if he meant dont judge  period  no context  then he never would have said throughout scripture to judge righteously.
19 20wrong.  the word used in greek for the first  fulfill  is           pl r saI  which means   uphold to completion .  the latin vulgate uses  adimplere  which means  fulfill   but it does not hold the original meaning in greek.  the oldest texts of the new testament are greek.  this comes from the fact that due to the conquest of king alexander  the great  of macedonia  the common language of the levant became greek  up until the roman empire expansion  and then later the spread of islam caused the common language to be arabic.  either way  bad translation  and lost context from the greek. moreover  in modern greek  the word that  is used            pl r s  is used  whereas             pl r saI  is the more archaic word.  both means  uphold to completion .  not exactly the same meaning as the english word   fulfill .as I stated before  the proper translation is that yeshua came not to abolish or to amend ha lacha  but to uphold and complete it  and not until heaven and earth passes away  not one iota of the law will be dissolved.  in other words  to truly follow Jesus  and by Jesus  own words  the law is still in effect.I am a bit of a scholar of these matters.I read latin  greek  and hebrew.also  nowhere in the Bible says that anyone goes to heaven.  also  hell doesnt exist either  if youread it in the original language.  to believe that you go to heaven  is actually the extrabiblical heresy that was left over from gnosticism.  also  the Bible does state that one will have                  z  n aI nion  which means   eternal life  or  immortality .  basically  the eschatological doctrine of the Bible says that eventually on judgment day  all will be resurrected and judged.  those who are found innocent will be granted immortality.  those who are with insurmountable sin  will be obliterated by fire.  not eternally  instantaneously  soul  spirit  and body ceases to exist  by immolation.
laura looks a little like tilda swinton.
lara croft is as iconic as samus if not more imo but right now one became totally generic uglification npc look while the other stay true to its fundamental iconic looks. suffice to say  its very unfortunate to what happened to lara croft. she basically got the same treatment like what happened to aloy in hzdfw...
why did they give her the hands of a wide receiver
thatstatue looks so bland  ineffectual and generic  even with the tank top  shorts and gun holsters it barely looks like lara croft. the facial experssion on itscreams less  badass adventurer archeologist with sharp looks and sharper wits  and more  lethargic yet frustrated karen rolling her eyes because the barista at starbucks had messed up her order .people can say what they want about the old games  graphics and designs  at least the more stylized aesthetics made sure you could recognize lara from a mile away.
you seem to conflate  muscular  with  strong . a muscular woman is not necessarily a strong woman.if its still permitted  watch  gone with the wind   a movie chock-full of strong women  none of whom had muscles anywhere nearly as defined as your models or lara croft. they were strong as women because they had strong characters  not because they had strong muscles.ripley in the 1st alien movie was not bulging with muscles  but she was strong  what proved her strength was her determination to live  and her ethical choices  such as saving the cat .Im probably the only person who didn t like terminator 2. they made sarah conner a psychotic low-life in order to make her  strong . and I wont comment about the last terminator movie.
agree on face   disagree on body.  but thats just me.
I thought square enix s version was fine and not too masculine. not hyper feminine but just feminine enough. I enjoyed the new games enough to ignore the design change. her old design was definitely great  though  dont get me wrong. thatstatue though  no  ma am. thats a hate crime.
I think the artist was given the wrong reference and used nathan drake by accident.
meanwhile nintendo keep their female characters being feminine. the woke are mad that zelda isn t the main character. Im willing to bet they never played zelda. all zeldafans know that link is the player. he is a mute because you are link. you pretend that you are talking to people. zelda games are about you exploring hyrule  serving zelda. that is it. they are signs that nintendo might make zelda playable in the main series. I bet you  that it wont be enough. they will complain about zelda youth beauty and her curves. I know that is the next thing they will complain about. trying to force zelda to look more manly. nintendo already didn t bend the knee for samus aran. by them saying no  samus is female. she is not trans  she is female.
this movement towards less feminine female representation in gaming as a means of progressivism is confusing.
well Imean  its hypocritical for any of us to judge each other considering none of us are righteous and we all rely on Jesus  sacrifice
@melonie mac go boom making a judgment is by definition coming to a conclusion. we make them every day. when I said it depends on where your heart is  Im saying that you cant be struggling with the same thing  such as alcoholism  while helping another with the same current struggle. they might influence you. in order to help someone  you need to come to the firm conclusion  judgment  that they need it. being led by the spirit in such would be righteous judgment.none of this claims perfection  but rather building each other up according to their needs.long story short  many people say not to judge  but we re supposed to judge with righteous judgment and pure intentions.
the Bible very clearly says on multiple occasions that we are not righteous nor do we go to heaven based on our righteousness  and that it is through Jesus  sacrifice. Jesus is the only  person  who lived a pure life 100  following the law  hence why he had to be our sacrifice. while we should still try to follow the law  it is impossible for any human to perfectly do so  which is why we need a savior. anyone who says they dont wont go to heaven  plain and simple.also I never said we go to heaven or hell immediately after death  but we will be judged and will be going to one or the other eventually.
@melonie mac go boom  kingdom of heaven   heaven.yohanan  john  3 13 no one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven  the son of man. the kingdom of heaven is basically an old testament concept. david declares that  the Lord is king forever and ever   ps. 10 16  cf. 29 10   that his kingdom is everlasting  and that his dominion  endures throughout all generations   ps. 145 13 . daniel speaks of  the God of heaven  who  will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed   dan. 2. 44  cf. ezek. 37 25   a  kingdom  that  is an everlasting kingdom   dan. 4 3 . the God of heaven is the king of heaven  and the heavenly kingdom is God s kingdom.matthew uses the phrase kingdom of heaven thirty-two times  and is the only gospel writer who uses it at all. the other three use  the kingdom of God.  it is probable that matthew used kingdom of heaven because it was more understandable to his primarily jewish readers. jews would not speak God s name       yhwh or yah wah or yahweh  or  jehovah    and would often substitute heaven when referring to him-much as we do in such expressions as  heaven smiled on me today. in so many words  upon judgment day  one goes to the  kingdom of God heaven   and not heaven itself.I like you  and would like to show you the errors of the modern church.  I have debated scholars with degrees...  pastors  bishops  and even catholic cardinals.  yet  none have been able to refute my biblical arguments against their heretical teachings.
except aloy has always looked like a real person whereas og lara with her cartoonish proportions would look extremely out of place with the graphically more realistic direction of the reboots.
the lady at 8 26 is looking at the lara croft statue and going   hmm. yeah  thats a dude.
wokeism is kind of like a neo gnosticism.  the old gnosticism is similar to what was found in the gnostic gospel that they ascribe to the apostle thomas  though the actual book was likely created centuries after the apostle s death  and cannot be considered his words  and thus why it was never made official canon of the Bible . compare this passage from the supposed  gospel    simon peter said to them   make mary leave us  for females dont deserve life.  Jesus said   look  I will guide her to make her male  so thatshe too may become a living spirit resembling you males. for every female who makes herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven    thomas 114 .this is not to bash trans people or anything  but to look at the particular agenda based around trying to make a person in the the image of the supposed superior sex. the gnostics of that time pushed the idea of men being the perfect being  and women being incomplete somehow. the current agenda appears to hide itself in the feminist movement of being about women s rights and all that  and yet women now are being pushed out of their own sports and activities in favor of trans rights activism. it is also concerning how this activism is trying to influence children who are not of age to consent to undergo life altering surgeries for this more male or female  androgenous look. some even consider how this may be tied in with a modern transhumanism as well.
soon they ll make her look like spongebob.
I agree with most of what you said here  and I cantell that you mean well...but I just want to point out that Jesus did not say that we shouldn t judge at all...he said to judge with righteous judgement in john 7 24  and not according to appearance. some of the most judgemental people I come across are the ones who condemn me for judging  and they are judging according to appearance.as I said  I cantell that you mean well  so I dont think anything you said makes you a bad Christian...but I just think this is something to be aware of.
I thought I was taking crazy pills when shadow of the tomb raider came out - honestly I liked the game overall but lara  as a character  just seemed off to me.the statues terrible - yes  but I kind of liked the new lara croft appearance.I like the  average woman  aesthetic- she has an every woman vibe- but personality wise I think it was a miss.angelina s lara nailed the personality imo - and if they had angelina s personality with the new aesthetic  imo they would have nailed it.Im really hoping for more lara in the near future but the reality is - if they wrangle up a new tomb raider now  they will most certainly fuck it up with identity politics and gender identity politics.they cant help themselves - all existing ips must be destroyed - that is their apparent mission.they think they re improving these ips with their woke ideology that no one really cares for and more importantly  doesnt generate revenue.the beauty is - I will always have the og lara
looks like abby from tlou2. I really hope the video game version will be improved.
first  let me say Imean no disrespect to you or anyone else whatsoever.thatsaid  nowhere in scripture does itsay not to judge. the verse is misquoted. people focus on the first part and ignore the rest of it. in context with itself and the surrounding verses  its telling us to judge righteously  to judge by scripture. we make judgements all day every day. its part of life. threat assessment either while walking down the street or in determining whether someone can be trusted with information  money  physical protection  etc. are all judgements.what scripture does say is that it is not for us to condemn others  but calling people out on their sin  especially privately  is not the same as condemning them.in reference to yesterday s video  homosexuality is a sin. scripture is clear on that in both old and new testaments.thatsaid  there is some nuance in that we may or may not be able to control who we are attracted to  but we absolutely can control whether or not we act on those attractions. I cant say for sure  but I assume thats the point everyone is trying to make.also apologies for writing a whole book in your comment section.suggestions for Christian youtubers to check out mike wingermelissa doughertyalisa childers
there making her look like chad
austin powers voice  thats a man baby!
thats just a big yikes!!  lol
dude became a chick and called himself lara croft
its larry croft!
lara croft   hour glass  big booba  the lips  badass  gunslinging  tomb f   ing raider! now we have masculine androgynous object.
these people have no idea what realism is anymore
darling  you can always talk your opinion  it is your right to do that. if they try to shut your mouth  give a shit for that. look at the latest jill valentine for example  they are working hard to fuck things up. sounds stupid  but I always say  everyone is born as as he she is  even a videogame or movie char . I am with you.
I still consider angelina jolie as the standard for lara croft lol
her face looks like arnold schwarzenegger from the first terminator movie ffs
lara croft cosplays nathan drake lol cant have anything nice in this world
I d be fine with a latina or a black lara croft version from the pics you showed.
thatstatue is a 3d printed fortnite skin  not lara croft.
I agree
lara wasn t an every woman though. the original lara croft was about 6ft or 5 11 tall.  she was always meant to stand out.
@max master j  truth - but it does look like thats what they were going for imo. if they had the personality right I really think it could ve worked.shadow was a mess though - lara s personality was disappointing
james 4 12  there is only one lawgiver and judge  he who is able to save and to destroy. but who are you to judge your neighbor
@melonie mac go boom  if you check other translations and follow the editor notes  assuming youre using a study Bible and or the youversion app or similar app  you will find the word  judge   as a verb  i.e. to judge  is often used in place of the word  condemn   which is a more accurate translation.to use a more modern example  to condemn would be to sentence someone for a crime. clearly this is not our place. only Jesus can do that  in regard to spiritual matters .in modern english we use  judge  in many different contexts. in most of these contexts  another word would be more accurate. for example we can  judge   that is discern  someone s character to be trustworthy or helpful  or not  in certain situations. this is quite different than condemning that person.as far as Im aware  every  or nearly every  time  judge  is used as a verb in the new testament  it is being used in a sense of condemnation or sentencing for a crime.another way to explain it  screaming thatsomeone is going to hell for having an abortion is condemnation and is wrong  i.e. not our place .having a conversation with that person and explaining why ending an innocent life is a sin is our place and is a good thing to do.yet both would be considered  judging  this hypothetical person by today s standards.we are to judge righteously.its a  hate the sin  but love the sinner  scenario.
@melonie mac go boom  I appreciate the back and forth. too often these days people are unwilling to have a civil discussion on a topic.
classic lara for the win.  tomb raider 2 is my fav
they took her pistols away.
they probably wanted a more  realistic  character  which  ok. thats fine. but there are actually some really cute and really beautiful female bodybuilders out there. and many of which still have those feminine curves.I have a bad habit of not watching the whole video or at least most of it before commenting.
this new lara croft should be called lara craft because she looks like she was crafted to make people who enjoy the original designs annoyed
surprised the statue didn t have a side shaved head.
just look what they did to my girl... or boy... Im not sure at this point.
except lara isn t a gym worm.
I say they go all the way  let s get lara croft looking buff and burly with a butch cut and biker tattoos and fatigues.
tlou 2 abI doing lara cosplay
they wont use any excuses they will straight tell you they do not want to make their characters sexy to the male gaze because men are bad.
the statue looks like abby from the last of us 2
the Bible stuff at the end reminds me of veggietales all over again.
doesnt look like any boy I know unless we ve already moved that far into androgyny lol but yeah doesnt look great  the new lara from the reboots was fine  why are they changing it
I thought that was abby from tlou2 cosplay as lara .
she looks like if leon kennedy decided to cosplay as lara croft
squenix  you had one job!
larry croft...her estranged brother
lol... I keep trying to click the like button forgetting I already have.
looks like abby from tlou lol
let s go!!!
look at those thighs   boom  upvote.
it looks like nathan drake with teets
there is software out there  where you can move a slider to add a more female look  one slider.
make girls great again!
where is this statue from
is that a statue of julius caesar
look how they murdered my thick laura croft
before I watch more  im at 2 33 ill give my thoughts on lara  I like the character  I never played the eirly games because I didnt have a playstation  and going back to them is a nightmare today control wise  google  lara croft s evolution from 1996 to 2018  and the first image result will be the image I reference  left to right 1 - 13I dont like 1 and 2  3 -5 look ok  5 being the best of those games  6-9 are ps2  with 7 and 9 being the best ones  then there is a live action which say what you want about the movies  I thought they were dumb fun  but she fit the bill for lara perfectly. now 11-13 are new lara  story wise  I played the first one  and this is essentially an origin story so I dont care if she comes off as weaker here  she felt far more girl next door. now realistically  doing what she does  she would gain muscle  I think the mistake they made was making her the average woman who gains muscle rather than the top 1  of those who do  if that makes sense.I think the best mix between old lara and new were the temple of osiris and guardians of light models  not the most realistic given what she does  but probably the best bridge between the old style and a more realsitic version of a person while still being a video game character and not someone you may see walking down the street.
they made a statue of abby from last of us 2
thatstatue has holsters and no pistols. lol
looks more like david bowie to me.
looks more like universal soldier
generic statue. you d think lara croft would be outstanding and pop out.
looks more like abby from last of us 2.
the face looks familiar...ah yes  its the golfer abby again.
lmaoo they really made thatstatue look like one of those fortnite default skin characters   ain t no way someone sees that and thinks oh wow lara croft... smh
its david bowie!
the first lara in the reboot was cute then they change it in a remaster and then they change it then its stupid.
hips dont lie    those hips cant even string together a sentence hmph!
I feel like Im being trolled rn
no  look at statures with cloth sculpted inth them   the veiled virgin  as an example  very easy to get soft features  this is shere incompetence if they wanted soft features.
4 26 no  she was I assume suppose to be like a supermodel  I think 3 and 5 on the above referenced image were good  I honestly hate her face till they move to ps2 games  body wise  I dont know how much is inteneded and how much is a limitation of the time  but but 5 or 6 is where I think they get the body good.
11 53 lol  im the opposite  there are no women I can look at and who look even half as good as statue lara  but I live in one of the most obese places in the country  the thin ones are universally taken here and whats left is... not good at all. but im ok with dying alone.
I have tomb raider on ps4. I got it with the console. I haven t played it yet but I think I will.
I knew itshe was a dude the whole time and I fell for it
statue face look like a younger michael jackson.
7 38 what about gina carano  she would be cool lara croft
the new lara croft looks like how they made teela look in the new netflix he-man show by kevin smith.  I guess they re trying to promote steroid abuse for women.
give someone from a 2000s boy band hormone replacement therapy  short term  and you get... well.. that.
is that a statue of tom holland promoting the uncharted movie
you are right on the money
its look like lara brother  darrel...
only time I ll go to church is to marry melonie.  3
agreed
look like an ddr athlete the new lara .
wait.... now Im feeling confused..... that looks like a woman... yes  a more realistic and less idealised female form like the first iteration of lara croft  but in no way androgenous.... she has waist hips and thighs... maybe the hips could have been slightly wider but not by that much  she very much still looks like an average athletic woman.... dont get me wrong Ivery much like the original one and am also of the same opinion as you that the reboot lc has very much lost the confident persona she was  along with the idealised proportions but she doesnt look bad... more realistic but in not bad.yes also concur her attire is something left to be desired  in the sense that no longer has thatsporty and classic exploring touches to it in the last games  hope they give us that in the next games that may come like they are showing in this statue.but returning to the point  its not very anatomically correct to call this androgenous...just like you I feel that lc has become very much tailored to twitter s tantrum  legion  but she still looks physically feminine...minus the face... anyone can very much agree that the face does look androgenous
is that david bowie
thats not what lara croft looks like
what in the holy crap even is that
that lara croft statue looks just barely better than abby from tlou2 and thats not a compliment
statue makes me think that the devs are trying to turn lara trans.
I can barely see the big statue behind you but it looks more feminine than the one on the street. also the one on the street has the face of male final fantasy character  duh fuc
turns out they just wanted to save money on jiggle physics and steal mocap from nathan drake. lol
Im not gonna marry someone who doesnt go to church so that ain t gonna happen lol!
@melonie mac go boom  its a mexican standoff!
thats not lara croft..    thats lesbian ellie from tlou2.  she s grown up a bit.
yeah  I prefer classic lara.
dont worry about all the milk drinkers.
even mtf look a lot more feminine!
seems like lara got abbyed hard.
cool nathan drake statue! ..... oh wait
thats a man baby! yeah! austin powers come out there.
4 14  beautiful face  shows 2 polygons
I want to see a short and dumpy lara croft. that will be true equality right there. what about a a guy  transitioning  from lawrence croft to laura croft
thats eric stoltz.
looks like david bowie.
when did sexy mean bad  some people really can not get past looks  but they just need to make a new character and stop banking on free advertising from reactions.
there was one abby in game - we dont need her anymore!or maybe lara s this way to make fun of her
everyone sins multiple times a day  and the majority of people dont realise that they sin multiple times a day
they went last of us 2 direction with this lara . . . smh
does neil drunkman have anything to do with this design  cause Im getting abby vibes from the tloup2.
I have to agree with you  thatstatue is awful looking. Ive played tr games since I got my first playstation  psone
its tom holland with a padded bra.
melonie mac go based!
they progressively made her worse.  progressive is the right word.
not feminine   bad   not a woman
its a gamers  choice to choose between male sheppard or fem sheppard. not male sheppard and abby from last of us 2.
step 1  melonie mac creates a new channel. step 2   melonie mac shows off pictures of attractive women while praising them for their femininity. step 3  profit.  she found the second step!
looks like a cast off from the last of us 2
actually mel  I need a judgement. pineapple or not
why are her holsters empty
reminds me of that chick from  terminator  dark fate .
thats david bowie
bizarro croft
hibukim   hugs if I am not mistaken
what were they thinking   that face and body.  no!  did you also notice her holsters are both empty  but the handguns aren t in her hands   I guess guns   bad  even on a video game character.
thanks I hate it. these clowns are  literally ruining everything.
whomever paid for thatstatue got ripped off
look at the man hands.
I like the first reboot tomb raider.
melanie mac - dont stop- go boom! use this platform as your heart dictates and you will make a difference for the better.
where can I find this pitcure I wanna examine it
that ain t lara thats abby from tlou2
lol  not only does that look like a high school boy with falsies  the holsters are empty!  I guess holstered pistols on a statue would have been triggering
ngl I saw the statue s face I thought it was david bowie xd
the statue looks milo yiannopoulos!
on the tomb raider social media accounts
@2 38 is the same guy that then posted his comment online @15 47 he knew something had to be done!
having sexy strong women is not what weak men want weak men want fragile women that wont knock them out when they take out their anger on them cause they cant fight other men.
strong female character      appearance  square jaw  pony tail  compressed bust  narrow hips  shorter legs  swagger pose.optional  half-shaved head and or aposematic hair.personality  righteous indignation  standoffishness  condescension  particularly to male characters . respected by the male characters  beloved by other female characters.optional  bisexual.if super hero  basically just make her superman  like they did for captain marvel in the mcu.
that is not lara. what the hell is that
tom holland in a padded bra.
I dont think they were going for a boyish looking lara  its just that the artist sucks and cant even sculpt a face lol. what have you done to lara   edit  oh  and if they make her look like this in the games  thank goodness we ve got mods!
preach !
pfft if you think laura looking like a dude is cool  you have issues. preach on!
yeah Im pretty sure that the other iterations of lara croft are much better than this one. lol
I remember women in american gladiators were strong and sexy.
a last of us 2 tombraider version
those are man hands. lmao
all these pretty ladies.... gimme 30-60 minutes I ll brb lol. seriously though  if they were going for sarah conner then they nailed it.
10 10 if youre a priest who digs little boys
I didn t liked the comparison with the really muscular woman  because they too already look too manly. some muscles can be very attractive  Im not gonna lie  but overdoing it just looks awful. but I definitely agree with the overall message of the video!
look like 45 year old soccer mom
wtf did they do to lara  are they going to make her a  trans-woman  to click some checkmarks  smh right next to ripley and samus she is what it means to embody a badass woman.
is that zarya from overwatch
what s the song at the end
is it the pelvis  hair  and the lack of color because she and the women you showed aren t that far off.
ripley was a genderswap
feminists   we must celebrate women!ends up celebrating masculinity and trying everything to be like men
larry croft
I would of liked to make the comment by saying  in the words of steven tyler  dude looks like a lady  . but its more  lady looks like a dude .
following the same footsteps as the remastered diablo and women s sports.
here is a like  and no hate.
the objective is to destroy anything traditionally beautiful.
lol its ma am!
its the shoulders and hips  the shoulders are too flat from the neck and the hips are completely in-line with the shoulder joints.those are male proportions.
should look like melonie.
lars croft...
commenting to feed the algorithm
looking like abby
larry kroft
low poly lara is best lara.
greetings from the netherlands
larry croft
dude lara........disavow!!
dude! wtf  why did they make lara croft  lawerence croft  ugh!!!!!
they really hate feminine features dont they
13 32real  photoshopwomen  debatable
dont worry melonie. the haters are these strange aliens who have an aversion to ample bosoms and child bearing hips.clearly not a crowd anyone would want to socialize with anyway.
the dog was not impressed.
I really hate that abby from the last of us 2 has somehow gotten work as being recast as lara croft after making and starring in the suck ass poor man s version of  spec ops  the line  which basically part of what tlou 2 was.
if they re so concerned about having a realistic laura why not start with the much more damaging idea thatshe somehow hasn t blown through her family s entire fortune by never actually dealing with finances  bills  managing her resources  spending millions on logistics  millions on weaponry  several thousands on massive medical bills  millions on lawsuits from the countries she pillages from  millions on legal defense for the bad guys she rightly kills  still  you know wrongful death allegations are coming   and never actually bringing any marketable resources back to academia. no college on their right kind will pay her to talk about how she shot a trex with pistols until it died or how a japanese witch could create tornadoes. this isn t a knock against tomb raider  I love the world  but selective reality is hypocritical. real laura should be on food stamps  have walmart guns    have massive personal loan debts.
maybe they finally decided to make a trans lara croft
just subscribed
I live not far from camden town where they stuck that promotional stature - the area is full of gay soI boI s  so they must ve loved that iteration of lara croft.
thats not lara croft
mel  I like you  youre a cool person  but please try to be more rational with these kind of criticisms.to a lot of people titles of content like this will come off as just rage bait and they will dismiss your concerns.I too wish that this statue is just some weird one-off and isnt representative of how the actual future lara will look like she definetly needs a more feminine body shape and features  aswell as more muscular legs  arms and core  but in a feminine way.
toned out on some exaggerating elements. she must be talking about her... eyes I guess xd
why is the statue s head so small compared to the rest of it  the hands shouldn t be as big as her whole head.
they wont be happy till all the women look like arnold at the peak of his roid abuse.
yep bring back sexy laura.
the lara statue in tomb raider chronicles looks better than this
larry croft
boom!!!
looks like a dark souls 1 default male character lol
it looks like nathan drake s trans brother
thank you
ugh  its abby from the last of us 2.
bruh thatstatue looks stiff af  literally they centuries ago they made statues look soft
why have two gun holsters  and no guns  xd
just look at the bodies of female pro wrestlers.  they can give a good idea of what an athletic body looks like.
take it easy. this is before the filter. they re going after the simps for catfish market.
agree. not to brag  but I could dress like this  croft  and prob look more fem then this and I have testies  beer belly and a beard. I really dislike how manly they make truly strong feminine fictional characters. just let them be. they have to ruin everything rather then make new fleshed out interesting characters.
what creeps me out is how women models in videogames are not allowed to have jacked arms  street fighter v is one of the few that allow that in their women but then again everything there is thick and jacked lol
wow that does look bad  unbelievable. looks more like that thing from the last of us 2  whatever that was.
very middle of the road. lacks the fun cartoon super hero bod.
looks like 1 of those east german female athletes they used to make fun of
reboot lara doesnt even look like the actress camilla luddington anymore - who is a very beautiful feminine looking female woman. and youtube keeps censoring my comments.
funny how they want men who are feminine and women who are masculine  and Imean arnold schwarzenegger masculine.
they praticly erased classic lara with the 25th anniversary     where she wasnt even mentioned shown. sadly most of the previous gen  rebooted  female protganist in gaming were merely androgynous blueprints. till this day I find it frustrating lara croft tomb raider was the ip how  3rd wave  forced themselves into gaming  im sure most people here remember how it went down  and how difficult it was to defend the character and franchise. and especially towards fellow gamers  cause sadly many might be antI woke today  but the vast majority actually supported  3rd wave  back than  till of course it threathend their own beloved franchises . these people always had a special hatred towards lara croft  residents evil s jill valentine  which they also managed to change  and of course final fantasees tifa  which they managed to influence  but didnt managed to get full control over yet .
I wouldn t buy it. the last lara croft looked okay. I loved thatshe was hot and could kick ass.
yay she got my comment  mom im on camera
what the hell is even that ! ! !
it looks like they went from angelina jolie to hillary swank. just saying.
so back in the middle ages we had to fight dragons to save the princess   today we had to fight the white knights for equality
they are trying to destroy feminine woman and masculine men. everyone would be the same
mm  Im just sharing my opinion. sjw  reeeeeee!
its in london  dont wanna give cosmopolitan weaklings anxiety.
@charming peasant  oh london  yeah  actual guns on the statue would cause meltdowns. but they could have made them large  rugged  strap-on pockets for extra snacks and adventure stuff. xd
the statue has that body type though. compare charlotte flair to it. the head is too small which throws things off but a lot of wrestlers have those same broad shoulders.
@randomfools  look at sable  jacqueline  and trish stratus.  all three have bodies similar to the original lara croft
@grand admiral adam  or more recently sasha banks. I get it.trish would be too short for lara. if she tried cosplaying her  it wouldn t look that good. stacy keibler probably could have pulled it off best from that era because of her legs.but what I was saying is there are women wrestlers who have this build and are not androgynous. becky lynch is similar to charlotte and still looks feminine. the comments saying she looks like abby from tlou2. I dont see it. thats like a shayna bazler body type and this is way more feminine than that.
yep. and I hate it......
bro imma guy and im curvier than that
why is chris hemsworth painted white
its the shoulders  they are a bitsquared for a woman.
when I looked at first I throught it was a fortnite female default skin.
thequartering brought me here.
_   _   our universe is corrupt . Im going to go move to a different planet and go hang out with some hot blue women from mass effect !
the tomb raider of us 2 coming soon to psn
I need to read the Bible but I have reading issues. I always have since elementary school. it makes itso difficult to sit down and read any book  let alone the Bible. I need to find some other way to do it.
abby croft
there is a tomb raider community  well  okay. I am a woman and have played these games for years on my old 360. I prefer og lara. there is a publicity photo of gina carano from fast and furious 6 that is very lara-esque. this new version is not lara.
I have nothing meaningful to say  just commenting to boost the algorithm.
why is her head so small
the new lara looks like that lesbian soccer player with the colored up hair
looks like justin beiber
abby croft
they had no problem making feminine looking statues back 3000 years ago...
they going to lose millions
to me the real lara croft has been replaced ever since the reboot. yup  thatstatue is androgynous  head too small  body too big  spot on describing it looks like a teenage boy. lara is on the uglyfied chop board. if lara is real she should have a build of a gymnast free climber.
laura frosk
its ok  I have reading issues too and I had to start reading esv to understand better. I struggle to keep up with very wordy things. but if that is too much you can listen audibly  the youversion Bible app has an audio book option
@melonie mac go boom  thanks melonie! and thanks for the verses btw. almost like an online Bible study!
leave they alone!... them can compete as a female protagonist if thats how they identify....
lezb0 croft.
the time of man has fallen the time of the pronoun has come
whats your other channel
lol  that a semI feminize leon kennedy xd
empty holsters. wouldn t want to offend anyone s sensibilities.
where s her guns  just empty holsters
almost everywhere in entertainment its like they want to make women look like men or super butchy....Im baffled by this!is this the end result of feminism. women who.... want to be men    its loco!!!!!!!booooom baby!!!!!!!!!oh yeah  and the statue looks like some dude who transitioned. and the transition didn t go all that well.....and the fitness model is a great example of a strong....female.
they were halfway to making her look like a dude once they adopted the  katniss everdeen  model for her...
dang Imiss the angelina jolie looking lara croft.why   I dont see how it benefits woman at all or men  its just weird honestly.
why cant lara be a beautiful and bold non-lactating  woman
that is not  lara croft  if you built that  they wont come....  but you can make melonie lara  I ll buy that. and any  haters  that wander this way  wander back- you will be destroyed  if you cant see her point. no threats  just facts. go make your own damn game  as you wish it to be. gtfo of our gaming system  or be derezed.
wtf is that thumbnail!  is thatshit real!  let s find out by watching.
why is that making a good looking woman in a game is a problem. itseem they even attack their costumes and amount of skin they show. however   they do this and change the women costumes but keep the costumes of the men which show a lot of skin the same. now unfortunately Imight end up buy the game if play is any good. but it need to change.
it looks like a basic cod character....... whyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
leon kennedy
and in other news indiana jones is now a woman.
never really got into the series but I will admit that the statute is ugly lol.
yeah today s entertainment has a thing of making women look like men with boobs  which is very strange to me and not realistic
statues looked more feminin in ancient greece.
u so beautiful melo
the most iconic female game character is slowly becoming a dude. progress!
why are so many corporations jumping on this trend of non feminine women. I love feminine women.
that is a trans lara croft.
all humans sin so that doesnt matter what does matter is if we are repentant for our sins and turn around from our mistakes
she was very beautiful in tomb raider remaster  but appeared a bit plain in the other two. I even think they made her shorter. man...I hate that the wokes are slowly trying to take over the gaming industry.
new lara croft looks like a man.
nathan drake post opp
this woke crowd needs to go back to sleep. when you go woke you go broke. they will be gone soon. let s go  branden
looks like lara has turned into some young boy with a case of gynacomastia. very disappointing considered what she originally was
classic modern video game females. base it on a existing woman from real life  and then go out of their way to make her ugly xd
so  her holsters are empty  as are her hands..... what happened to her custom pair of m1911a colt .45acp pistols  has she been disarmed  is she supposed to be a vulnerable victim at this point  what is the point of this statue
her face looks like its melting. the statue looks like it was inspired by thatstupid ..I dont know if its a boy or girl from that horrible terminator film.
where are her guns the statue does not have guns
empowered women look like men...
about works james 2 20-26
2 30 - hahaha... dude  thats not lara croft - thats leon kennedy in laras clothes! funny that the people who find the original lara croft offensive and sexist are now turning her slowly into a man... that is feminism gone mad!
were the manly features meant to distract from the fact they took away her pistols  too woke to show firearms in a public space  even if they are carved in stone...
steven tyler  lady looks like a dude!
flower petals protected at all costs  then delete my comment on statues camel te
look at uncharted 4.nadine is a dude acting like a woman.nadine kicks the crap out of nate and his brother.  nate and his brother who have fought and killed countless mercenaries and killers.  yet on uncharted 4 neither of them could lay a finger on a black woman.
which is what I said in my video that when you get closer to God  you naturally dont want to sin. putting in the effort is works beyond faith.
@melonie mac go boom  fair enough I still think your statement at the end of the vid about works was eye brow raising.  all the works wont get us into heaven we all still need grace.
somebody tip thatstatue over. not a sin.
because the best woman is a man in a dress that works
no hate  only from fembots
could be a ripped feminine bloke dressing up
its a man baby
why do they use fox  the trans mma fighter as the model for video game women
its kind of obvious what s going on here. the statue doesnt look realistically like a man or a woman  hence your correct use of the term androgynous . but it does look like some of those trans  female  athletes who have been dominating college women s swimming events lately. and Im sorry if this offends anyone  but I just cant relate to this. whatever you think is the motivation for the millions of dudes who played tomb raider  fawning over a character design falls way short of attracting players. it was absolutely the sense of power and the spirit of adventure that made the experience compelling. but to ask someone who has no reference point for being trapped in the wrong body to take on that kind of persona in a game  its simply beyond the pale for me. Im not saying we shouldn t do what we canto accommodate people s individual needs. there should be games for everyone. but I dont think its possible for individual games or designs to please everyone. you have to pick a lane and own it. do the very best at whatever your passion is. changing old characters just suggests  I think unfairly  that it cant succeed on its own and has to ride the coattails of an existing ip to capture an audience.
why have they given the statue a nathan drake style shoulder strap holster thing    give the lady her dignity and femininity back. we want lara  not butch betty.p.s gina carano. she s purpose built to be lara Im any film reboots.
like. seriously. that looks nothing like lara croft. that isn t lara croft. crazy thing. in this day in age. I cant tell whether it  whatever the heck that man statue is   was intentionally made like that or if the artist just did a miserable job. get rid of it.
psh  whatever.  just put your own picture up there.
probably mucking about with the character because she is white lol
hmm...so feminists are against femininity  seems counter productive somehow. lara was always a badass...with the curves!
apparently  the best a woman can be is a man.
they must stop trying to copy uncharted.
what the fuck is that
the statue looks like a nasty fortnite character
the world wants men to be women and women to be men.
lars croftmale to female transgender
its the face and broad shoulders. seriously awful
I cant keep a straight face when you compare the low poly lara to fitness models. peak comedy. I cant find joy in the new lara.
like...larry croft.
lara almost looks like a dude now
.. I played the very first tomb raider  and this looks like sh1t  the original lara is what we want  period. its funny how they make a non binary lara
be proud of who you are! except if you are a feminine woman  thats bad somehow.
they might as well have just gave this new laura croft a swingin ding-a-ling
male feminist approved
thats a man  baby
notmylaracroft lol the sculpt is stellar tho  kinda hard getting good proportion but hey...if you sculpt the tomb raider  make it right. it looks like someone did not get  references from convept artist and wing it with the woky woke people itseems like
the big difference is the face. that face is awful. why would you do that
sorry but I never cared for lara and sure as hell never dream of being with her.I do find it disgusting that chic s are being made more masculine or turned just turned gay.
wow  withouth context I would sincerely think the statue was of a transexual.
do you still stream or make gaming content anywhere  I remember your content being so fun   wholesome but now it feels like you only do aggressive political content. legit been seeing dudes posting your takes to trash on women in gaming that aren t  hot . not sure what the goal is
I agree with melonie  its a poor  lumpy statue that lacks vitality and does not reflect the best of any of the timeline laras.
whats wrong with lara being attractive   how how is masculising  if thats a word  women good for feminists   Im genuinely confused.
oh. they ruined another franchise. great.
perhaps its not to offend muslims  again
in germany we call woman who look like this  kampflesbe ... has nothing to do with tomb raider... shame
the face on thatstatue is all wrong. jaw is too round  cheekbones too low  and the brow is too narrow and recessed. the nose is too upturned and the upper lip is nonexistent. I have no idea who the artist was emulating  but itsure dont look like ms. croft.
I dont understand you melonie. in shadow of tomb raider when they presented a more masculine lara in the beginning you were super excited and praising the model. and afterwards when they reduced her muscles you were whining. so what is it now
1st john 4 7-8
unified lara croft looks like marilyn manson from the coma white album cover  only he was hotter.
this is a brand new channel about social commentary  so if you dont like social commentary then this channel isn t the one for you lol
@melonie mac go boom  asked because your main channel has a lot of these videos too. wasn t sure if youre just leaving the gaming industry or what  came here because dudes were using clips from this channel to bully women on social media. used to watch you often   was trying to figure out what is going on.
I was excited thatshe had muscles  before they removed them   not thatshe was masculine. if you watch my video here you will see I shared pictures of curvy  muscular women who look feminine and amazing.
God gave scripture that explains he is the judge not us. Im not sure of the exact scripture but their many were God or Jesus choose not to judge but to forgive and ask those who sin to sin no more.
I d normally I go with a welll analyzed aspect of what my thoughts are but Im just gonna keep this short and simple.lara croft here looks like a dude.  I only ask why
the greeks were better at sculpting female figures. they didn t even have power tools.
the face looks really  really bad
thatstatue in camden is hideousnon binary lara croft everything woke turns to
thatstatue has no muscle tone and where expected to believe she can climb mountains
you wouldn t need angelina jolie to play the new lara croft......you could hire megan rapinoe instead. feminists want to make women men and men women.
this is abomination
if laura croft looks like a dude in any game or movie I wont be buying it or watching it.....
thatstatue looks terrible  I grew up with the tomb raider games and this is a fcking insult to the character.
turning lara into abby. what a shame. what s wrong with women being beautiful and curvy. I dont get these woke sjw s.
this  live ep  statue looks so ugly. hope this is only for this project and wont show up in the new game!
probably trans
never found the original lara to be good looking  the reboot lara was much better looking and I do like boobas too  so that is not the problem for me.
there is a reason why the Bible is split as old and new testamentJesus come to get  probably isnt the correct word   closure  to the profecies and fulfill the promise God made to israel  and bring hope and a new promise  this not only to israel  but to the entire world
ugh thats terrible ! who is the artist this is a terrible rendition of lc...oh come on why the karen hair     oh ! I see now. Ive just been told this is a statue of lara s cousin karen croft ok well then thats fine Im sure she needs a statue too for all her battles with restaurant managers all over the world
I know the woke people are wrong and this is happening because of them  but personaly  I dont realy care what she look like lol I want her to be strong minded  I want lara croft personality  the rest of it isnt important for me. I understand the reason of the change is wrong  realy wrong   those woke people are getting control of everything and it needs to stop
you actually deleting my comments  thought you were for free speech
you quoting scripture is missing something. you are reading old testament rules and those rules were for a different time.  new testament teachings do not include those edicts.
not even a tomboy. this looks like a soyboy with pads. this is why games cant be good. no company has the balls to do games like back in the 2010s. Imiss my childhood.
she s not appealing at all..... sorry but this is not the tomb raider... thats just a random amature achioligist. not a Christian myself but respect for you to stadn up for your self. love ya. hugses.
I honestly dont see the problem youre seeing.
I always find it both sad and funny that these raging feminists all want to look like men...despite apparently hating them
agreed  but God is cruel.and there are no good woman left.
I ll give you more androgynous sure but 14yr old boy with a padded bra is a bit of a stretch. naughty dog did the same thing with chloe and she looks fine.
no offense but girl lara croft is a fictional character she is not real its just a game no offense I like you as a youtuber
you spend almost this whole video being a champion of a powerful but feminine and natural female body. but then say youre not a feminist. Im sorry but in what way are you not a feminist  youre arguing your form of social justice in that youre defending athletic female body types. but youre not a feminist  and then you slam the  woke . but please tell me more about how you dont judge others.
I thought this chick was cool  genuinely. but she deleted comments of mine so she cant be about free speech. the comments were nothing bad towards her  I just commented on how ridiculous the statue looked. unsubscribed
no she doesnt
so thats why there is Bible stuff at the end. you are one of them. so do you not know or do you not care
hate to break it to you but some of these fitness women you showed were clearly taking atleast small amounts of testosterone for body building... natural female anatomy doesnt allow for women to put on that much muscle mass
thatstatue looks hideous.   definitely very manly.  I liked the lara from the reboot games. she looked amazing.   plus  you cant go wrong with the og lara.  but this is God awful.
I wiiiish this statue looked half as womanly as chloe lol
@melonie mac go boom  do you think the statue may look at least slightly better if was painted and not the color it currently is  genuine question.
im guessing she doesnt want to be called a feminist and be attached to the  crazy ones
I have not deleted any comments except 2 that were gibberish spam. your comment probably got auto filtered by youtube for my review that I have to approve. I will be able to check once I get to my pc. for future reference  dont assume someone deleted your comment. youtube has a filter system thatsucks.
