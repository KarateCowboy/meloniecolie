in the audio tapes of these two fighting amber admitted that johnny would always try to avoid her when they fought.  he would frequently lock himself in another room to avoid her.this is not how an abuser would react to their victim during a fight.  johnny is a victim and obviously needs a lot of help to get his life back in order.   amber is a horrible narcissistic abuser and also needs a lot of help.
this trial has opened so many people s eyes  that not only women but men can be abused and bad either way I know many men are afraid to come forward about abuse because it ll be laughed at or not believed
Im really glad that the trial is public  its bringing attention to a topic that doesnt get enough recognition.
Im so glad people are catching on that woman abuse too . I was punched in my face by my ex because she was drunk and I had a black eye and a bruised cheek . people were just watching her hit me like I was her property . Im the guy and cantake it but that doesnt make it any less demeaning.  the whole time I was thinking   at what point do I ever get to hit back   we are long broken up   Im just glad people are finally catching on
apparently  she has a daughter. scary  because her daughter will likely be affected by her toxic and abusive personality  and the horrid cycle will continue indefinitely.
hImelonie  Ive been following you for a while now. I think your  mad hair  looks great.the same applies to depp and will smith.women wage psychological war on each other. its something you learn all through school and is why women are great manipulators. it can cause a great deal of long term harm. men dont do that and are rarely equipped to handle that form of abuse. thats why when women abuse men its mostly hidden trauma.men are physical. get into a fight. one wins  one loses. its over  move on. women are rarely equipped to handle that form of abuse.but men who were brought up properly  know not to use their strength on women unnecessarily.female abuse can last for years.
I got yelled at a couple of times when I opened the door for some girls before! they said  we can get our own door  Im not helpless   in both instances. I was shocked when that happened. crazy huh   Im in my 30 s and older women appreciate it more then the younger ones do.
do not ever stop sharing your Bible verse of the day - it is the part I look forward most to  and I hope others realise how much they are blessed by thatsegment. go boom  melonie!
thanks for providing a positive environment on the internet. love the positive lifestyle. thank you for the entertainment. wishing you mech success.
youre going to hear the testimony from amber about how she had to mix the different colors for the different days of the bruises as they developed in the different coloring and how she would use to touch those up.  am I the only one who reads this as ah touching up her bruises  i.e. making them look better worse depending on the situation
I never see a hint of discouragement on your face. youre human  so Im sure you have down days  but you always have a big smile. its nice to see. I hope your channel continues to grow and more people can get a glimpse of what the Lord offers.  joy not dependent on circumstances
I really hope this trial goes jd s way.  all the past relationships he s had and not one case of him being an abuser.  she s the one with the history of said behavior.  I hope things go well for the streamer that is being sued as well.  wish I could say that was the strangest case I heard.  there s a slovenian youtuber that had two stans end up relocating across continents to her home town.  luckily things didn t get too out of hand but still.  may your days continue to be blessed.  through melonie we go boom.
milanI cosmetics came in clutch but in all seriousness Im glad they said something because I knew thatshe was gonna do something crazy like thatsmh
I cant believe people would give you a hard time about anything. you strike me as the type of person who s nice to anyone you meet. really enjoying the content  especially the Bible segments.
its sad that even after all this  amber s career hasn t been impacted  yet depp will probably never be in a hollywood movie ever again
I wanted to say I find you nothing short of inspirational. I first found you on a tomb raider discussion video  and since then have been hooked. what you ve been saying about the series I can wholeheartedly agree with. your view on where the series and lara herself have  progressed  through the years is enlightening. I feel the same way  but was never able to articulate why  since legend came out  my interest in the series seemed to wane. I have been playing  and replaying  the tomb raider series since I was a child. my favorites are the classics. I grew up with her and she has been a hero to me since  and I want nothing more for the series than a resurgence of the classic formula brought to modern gaming.secondly  I was taken aback when I heard youreading scripture. I was not expecting it and was very pleased to hear someone on this platform give such a heartfelt description of God s word. being a fellow believer I find what you have to say in this regard very encouraging. I commemorate your braver and determination to proclaim God s promises and lessons. its not easy to stand against the current I know. keep up the good fight and show those wokies that we too have a backbone. we stand with you. sorry for the book  but I felt it had to be said. praying for you. -your brother in Christ
Ive had a couple girlfriends that would hit me whenever they were mad. Im 6 5  and 230lbs and they felt I should just be able to take it. it makes you feel trapped when youre in a fight because you cant and shouldn t hit back. leaving is always the best choice in thatsituation
hey I got onto the video thanks. as a Christian I really appreciate your content especially as a young person sometimes it feels like if I say something I ll get cancelled keep up the good work God bless
this whole thing is so sad. people do not realize how hard it is to get out of a toxic abusive relationship. physical and emotional abuse leave scars that never go away. as Im on a short break with my treatment  I spent a couple hours outside photographing nature  2 hours working on my garden  and zero time on social media. I feel great! my back my disagree in the morning but thats a tomorrow problem.
not that amber heard is going to watch my video...  one week later  so... Im being sued...    kidding
dont think so. feminists just ignore this case as they always do.
@burrosswe  tbh thats true sad but true
@burrosswe  depends on the verdict however if their reaction to the whole chase where a female singer divorce her husband and she found herself having to pay alimony  one can expect  if amber is found guilty  their reaction to be something along the lines of  amber shouldn t have to pay anything  let her debt be cleared as reparation for all the abuse women have suffered at then hands of men through out the centuries.  and we will probably also so see something along the lines of  one bad apple does not a rotten basket make  men are still those who are predominantly violent.  or if you want it boiled even further down it will be  when a woman does it its okay  when a man does its not.
imagine how many men in ages past were trained to be violent by women who would abuse them and feel justified because  men cantake the beating
people know they just dont care. they will make any excuse to not punish a woman for this kind of stuff.
take care  3
she  has a child  that was conceived through a surrogate mother. so  she might be a parent  though I doubt it  shes never had or carried a child and has no genetic offspring. personally I think she can do a lot of damage  but I suspect she probably has very little to do with that child nor do they share genetics so I think the kid has a chance at least
@chris m  okay  thanks for those little details.
uh   I never saw will smith with  mad hair .
if you get crap for opening holding the door for a woman  the response is   Im not holding the door because you are a woman  Im holding it because I am a gentleman. I always open hold doors for my wife and any woman. it makes my wife s day when she gets looks waiting at the door for me to open it lol
@clerical error  oh I did say the gentleman part the second time it happened. fortunately it was only a couple of negative experiences. the majority of the time it was positive.haha itsounds like you spoiled her!
I think it is the proper thing to do for anyone  regardless of gender that is entering a building after you  just as a sign of respect.
@onemanarmy36  yup  totally agree!
literally  one of my highlights for the day  and I am a non-religious catholic.
I 100  agree.  Im a Christian but for a long time now Ive not been living my life as I know I should be.   its amazing how easily small distractions can get put in my way to keep me from doing that.    melonie  your videos and the Bible verse of the day have really helped me keep on track.   Im sure you are also helping many others in more ways than you know.
agree! I love it too. amen!
that is because of msm  we need to boycott anything that promotes at.
I think the only setback she s suffered is getting kicked off aquaman 2.
she hasn t got any depth as an actor  and if aquaman is her big claim to fame  she ll sink like a wine bottle in the ocean.
I had some emotional issues especially as a kid  some real self-hatred  and in those times I d essentially beat the shit out of my head.  I clearly have some sort of ptsd related to that  if I get unexpectedly hit in the head  I ll instantaneously flash back to being extremely angry  and at least for a second I ll be ready to swing on someone  to punch someone.  it was amazing how many times I had to carefully  calmly explain to an ex whose habit was to slap me relatively hard on the back of the head when she thought I was being silly.  its like    you need to understand  if I ever dont control myself because Im distracted I ll end up shattering your skull  and youreally dont want me to do that. but its amazing how much of a habit the simple not-really-abusive sort of abuse can be.  the  oh its not a big deal because Im a woman  line of thought.
a few a jds sponsors have defended him. I remember a cologne company defending him during the sun trial.
keep doing your videos the way you want to do them. verse of the day is so nice  and helps 100 people for every 1 person that gives you a negative comment about it. mad respect to you always.
ha  there s no  allegedly  when we ve heard from her own mouth how she s hit her partners.
what I love is that amber is a l oreal spokesperson  girl couldn t even use their product in her lies since I am seeing so many ppl saying they are buying milanI because of that tiktok post. I also have thatsame milanI compact
abuse doesnt have to be physical either. sometimes it is verbal abuse.
jen psakI is reportedly leaving her position as press secretary and I d like to recommend amber heard for job. just imagine how much fun press conferences would be with amber throwing things and punching out reporters.
love the new hair style very nice. keep doing what you doing what you do.  pop culture  movies  gaming  and of course your videos would not be complete without your verse of the day from the Bible. your kind thoughtful  easy going nature  and your faith make this the place to come .
yep I can just 100  tell that depp is the victim in this case. ofcourse we cant know for sure if he has or has not hit her  but if he did  it could very well be self defense. my ex gf used to abuse me too. I was acting exactly the same as depp did. locking myself up etc. and she would kick the door  or slam it with a hammer to create a hole. it was a f.n crazy time. I never got taken seriously btw. police were called on multiple occasions  they asked her if she wanted to press charges for an alleged  fight   where she was the only attacker. they never asked me anything. and in cases like this  youre affraid to speak up  because of the consequences  what may happen when the police leaves. neighbours who heard the screaming and fighting automatically thought I was abusing her  because our direct neighbours never talked to me again... men need help too if they get abused. its a cruel and unfair world. we are also someones child  father etc. not only did I get abused  I lost near everything and got punished for being abused. why  because society is messed up and many people have a hand in that. help those in need  men or women.
I like your verse of the day segment. it really helps normalize discussing biblical values alongside content you make.
so many women want to be treated like a lady but they dont want to act like a lady!! I wont give or show respect or be a gentleman to a gobshite who screams victim when their vile behaviour is shown to the public!! my mum and dad taught me standards and they also taught me how not to be used as a door mat.. stay strong and safe decent people. loving the channel melonie.x cheer s beautiful
you are doing a great job  keep up the content.  I am loving this channel ever since I saw you on fnt.
I feel actually appreciated by you mel thank you.
I always enjoy your verse of the day and the commentary with it.  keep it up!
love the not so new channel mel from the topics speaking about to the Bible verses.  wish people didn t hate so much on  that part as you mentioned they dont have to watch.
from what I understand of their relationship history  ah went after jd to make him hers. she imitated and perpetuated the toxic relationship  and cried crocodile tears to cover her cruelty to him. this relationship is an illustration we are not to be unequally yoked. God knows that missionary marriage only works one way  to lead the Christian away from him.
Ive said this before and I ll say it again.amber heard  without the benefit of a full team of experienced makeup artists  looks like she was the girl in high school who was friends with the popular hot girl. not the ugly girl who they kept around to make themselves look better  but definitely not the really hot one. but since graduating things haven t gone her way and she has gone downhill  from like a 7 10 to a 5. that is what she looks like.
not only did she abuse him  but he had it on audio recording her bragging about it and how nobody would believe him.  pretty outrageous  even if johnny loses tho now the truth is out there and her reputation is garbage.
thirteen years!!!! good Lord melonie  youre an old lady! lol just kidding  I love your videos they put a smile on my face and we all could use a little more of that these days!  btw  dont fall down and go boom!
it was reported that amber also used nail polish on a tissue to fake blood from a broken nose too.  apparently  makeup is very useful when faking injuries in all sorts of creative ways.
unfortunately with chargebacks  the bank will usually side with the customer versus the retailer  or person that took the money . its an uphill battle when someone issues a chargeback and you will probably get charged a fee on top of that  could be   20 . however  in this case  I feel like itshould be on twitch to deal with it instead of the streamer itself since they re acting as the middle man.

always remember what ever the public does to us they do it to Jesus. by the way I did watch you inside gamestop.
I said it before... the only proof they have of jd being nasty about ah is when he was venting to other people... there is literally no proof he said any of thatstuff to ah directly.
also found you through the drinker  lovely to see that other Christian woman gamers exist!keep up the good work  love the Bible verses
I love melanie s videos because of the girl friend experience.
amber s entitled attitude is becoming much more common  a percentage of the population has been convinced that women cant be abusers  even bringing up the notion can get you labeled as a misogynistic chauvinist. pointing out reality isn t allowed anymore because becoming offended is social currency.
never back down from your beliefs and mission.
justice for johnny
im married to a wonderful woman. I watch your content cause of the quartering shouting you out and I like the content.
the new hair style looks good on you. thanks for covering this.
women aren t abusive in this industry.   ...oh  really
I received enough emotional and financial abuse during the first 15 years of adulthood to make itso I cant even consider having relationships anymore. maybe it will change in the future  and it would be nice to not be alone all the time  but idk how the damage can be undone or if it even can be. it was depressing for a few years  but now its just life
I am seriously liking your hair. it really looks good on you.
the makeup company next product should be called the lying amber concealer.
I wasn t sure about the new hairdo at first. not that I thought it was bad. its definitely growing on me. complements from a strange internet rando. cheers.
really enjoy your content!
you know Im not religious but I fully support your verse of the day. there s a lot of good general advice in the Bible.
I gotta say  your hair looks amazing
hey melonie its fine calling your channel new. its no big deal! the new texas giant roller coaster down the street from me is still called  new  for the last 10 years! haha
the men being stronger than women thing kind of goes out the window when you consider how ingrained it is in men not to hit women  even in self-defense . the man is afraid to restrain the woman because he knows how easily he could accidently hurt her or bruise her more delicate skin  and that the law is more likely to side with the woman. Ive never been in a domestic violence situation going in either direction  but I know there are cowardly women who ll hit a man under the presupposition that he wont hit her back and she ll have the benefit of the doubt. look at emma roberts  julia roberts  niece  and evan peters  quicksilver from x-men   he dropped all charges and nobody talks about it. switch their roles and he wouldn t be working today just because the cops had to be called.
boom! . so she lie under oath . now what shall we do to her  5 years in jail

amber concealer concealer.
I saw a stat  from hhs  that 52  of abuse was committed by women. who knows how often it goes unreported too. there is still a social stigma for men to report thatsort of thing.
Im really surprised that the judge allowed this trial to be publicly broadcast. we re talking about a defamation trial where the court of public opinion plays a roll. unlike murder or other criminal trials where the jury is kept confidential to keep the well from being poisoned. very strange in my opinion.
just imagine if any of the stuff she has done to johnny was the other way around.. he d already be in jail. forget paying out 50m
I always end up forgetting what the video is about by the end
Ive taken the major payne attitude to relationships in my 40 s. if God wanted me to have a wife  he would have issued me one.
hey mel what s your stance on rts games such as dune 2000 or command   conquer
all hail jd!amber and jada should be a good couple.
who said romance was dead. wow what a marriage
batter foundation  new from revlon! when you get that backhand just use a slab of batter!
wait.  on my social commentary channel   not  on my new channel  any more something changed here. xd
males streaming on twitch and  females streaming  particularly attractive females is totally different. Im certain you must know that.ask yourself this  if the ability to make money from streaming on twitch was completely taken away would you see the biggest dip on the female side or the male side  I think it would be the former by a large margin.thats what I think twitch should be personally. go back to the old justintv days where people stream purely for fun and to hang out in their spare time.
hmmm happy thanksgiving! now brace yourself time to argue! ..no really it hurts me to disagree with you  hurts to know you will think I am  stupid  and I know it hurts you for someone to question something that brings you success and such happiness .but like you ve said elsewhere disagreements are a part of meaningful connections .so there s that .I think when people say  selling the girlfriend experience   they aren t stupid I dont think you are  stupid  either I think it is just a different perspective friendship between two people doesnt  necessarily mean sexual activity  simping  isn t just of from my perspective  to me  friendship is sharing life  family  home  time and effort .people are seeking meaningful connections so when you say  boys do it   it doesnt change my opinion .life is busy and keeps getting busier and in normal development as an adult you marry and have children for friendship friendship is more than telephone connections .like Ive said  to me a  friend  shares much more than acquaintances now I dont have any intentions of taking away from you what brings you happiness you are a spring of joy a sea of awe and beauty and we gather here and gaze upon you now Im pushing my boat out on the waves I ll brave being washed up castaway or drowning .Im grateful for you I accept the challenge Ive worked in media and have my own peace with it Imake content..I put it out for distribution but Im not really that interested in building a community around it to me its false impression .and low on my priorities .I dont think human beings have the capacity to have meaningful relationships with millions of people we weren t built that way our brains our bodies .not built for it only God is Im not God nor am I  a  demon .. I am a man put in this world to live the life God sees fit and that which this body and brain endure  about finding my  soulmate Ive always thought this  I could never do it without you .be complete but I still did all that I could  .you are irresistible  mel God bless you and may both our boats row steady.
Ive dated an amber...thier all cray cray. change my mind
smart on the company to get ahead of distancing themselves from the domestic abuser.   yes  she is one.  come at me.   kind of sounds like heard is auditioning for some kind of brand ambassador role and the company is shutting that down real quick.  Im not the consumer make-up is directed at  but the fact that they re calling out the lies tells me they wont cave to the woke bs.  if I ever do become a woman  Im going to be buying their products exclusively.
she admitted to abusing johnny
that guy gave his money away  thats not her fault he gave her money. I dont think a bank can do anything about that  its also not that banks fault he gave her money.
you used my comment I demand a relationship now. lol! just kidding  just kidding  I love your videos.   God bless!
I dont know why anyone would consider twitch a dating site. wish it would have stayed mainly a gaming and music streaming site.
awesome video.  goboom
there s rarely a reason that trials shouldn t be publicly broadcast   any trial you can walk up to the courtroom and get entry.  amber heard requested it not be broadcast  but that would need to be the exception  not the norm.in theory we put trust in the jury to do their duty and not get information outside of the trial... but yeah right.  juries suck  like the recent kim potter trial where jurors went public immediately about their deliberations and essentially made it clear they didn t understand the law they were deciding on .  but its the best we got  like that churchill quote about democracy   its the worst form of government  except for all the others that have been tried.
jk its just 2 actors falling in love for all the wrong reasons
appreciate your support towards my channel 
I streamed way before money could be made doing so. if monetization were removed  there would be a big drop in both female and male streamers.I think your expectation of streamers making no money is impractical as well. so you want access to their entertainment and want them to spend tons of time for your entertainment without compensation  lol
there s this weird thing Ive found most women dont understand   men also just like the company of pretty women  it feels good  inherently confidence-boosting and whatnot.and I think thats a sickness that goes on with the  pretty females streaming  community  is how much of it are the pathetic  in the most literal sense  but really every sense  men who get some of that feeling of companionship from streamers... and its sick because its only the illusion of it  the self-delusion  none of it is real.and yeah  it ll lead to some of  em who end up with the thoughts   oh  she noticed me  maybe I ll have a chance with her... so glad Im not born a woman with  unrealistic  beauty standards combined with inherent vulnerability  but man  the  man  thing can be rough too when one gets desperate.but anyway  yeah  the reason I say that   it would probably be far better for the mental health of hundreds of thousands or millions of men if the money was pulled out of streaming  because God knows they ain t gonna pull their money out on their own.
@transroofkorean  well put. the skeptic in me says most are perfectly aware of this and choose to turn a blind eye and act ignorant to it but maybe some genuinely dont know. but I would guess most are completely aware of the reality of twitch and simply dont care as long as they are being   compensated
digging  your hair like this.
to address one of the comments at the end not all female streamers sell the gfe but a lot of them do. pay attention to the way they talk to chat or respond to donations subs. a lot of them act flirty  dress like they re going out  etc. its an act for their simps. guys just dont do that. Im sure there are a handful of guy streamers you could argue sell a boyfriend experience but the way they interact with their audience is just not the same.the real issue is simps not getting they re being naive. the streamer is just playing the game so I dont really expect them to change. the simps gotta wake up.
this trial is very important to men rights
careful melonie to assume an ass kicking doesnt fall out of the sky sounds oddly like  internalized misogyny . this is sarcasm of course Ive encountered way more misandry in present day than Ive heard guys being misogynistic. not saying there aren t any just saying I dont think the supply satisfies the demand these days
hey melonie  dont know if you know this but Im danandorf on your server. its pretty subtle  but you may have figured it out. anyway  just wanted to say thank you for the shoutout and Im excited to get to work!
streamer sells the girlfriend experience    spoken like someone who has never had a girlfriend  or a friend who s a girl.
amber could still win just because she is a woman and fairfax is very progressive. I wouldn t put it past the judge to make stuff up  exceed her his purview  let amber violate various rules and procedures  ignore mr. depp s due process and other legal protections  or overrule the jury. why because I lived in fairfax  va  and it is a left-wing progressive hell hole. for example fairfax electors were quick to say they wouldn t meet the legal deadline for reporting vote counts during the va 2021 state elections. but I guess they allegedly gave up trying to throw the election for the democrats when every district in the state outside of the hell hole that is richmond was 10 to 20 points in favor of republicans. in other words  fairfax could be considered a little san francisco. there was no crap on the street but they had issues with local churches ending up in the news for all the wrong reasons.
hey melonie I just want to say that lies makes you get in trouble more than telling the truth and so plus makeup does not hide the scares that you show on the body or your face until you wash your makeup off of your body and your face  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say that bout this topic  ok melonie. anyway also I just want to tell you that I love and like your Bible verses that you share everyday on your channel  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
lana rain or melonie mac hard to pick to be honest
I dont think that dude watched the video. when I read the title my first thought was  oh  hot tub asmr thot. no sympathy from me.  turns out she plays destiny. but a lot of chicks on twitch really do lead guys on to get money from them.
I honestly thought you were 26 or 27.good genes wow
thank u God bless
I hope that the sun is kicking itself.
excellent vid
when r u going 2b live on twitch again melonie
love your hair
I like your hair this way.  my hair is flat.  boring.  I dont know why you use to straighten it.  I thought having volume is a thing.  maybe you were doing it was because of lara.
love the hair
well the classic joke is a wife throwing dishes at a dodging husband because funny

you do go boom
ignore ladBible   they are a bunch of trolls.
yes. a woman can easily abuse a man. especially men that were  raised right . you know  taught at an early age not to touch a woman in anger. some women cantake this as a sign of weakness and get as violent as they can  knowing the man will not strike back. it happened to me. my ex wife attacked me many times. she even went as far as attacking me and then calling the law saying I attacked her. the police came and saw marks on my face  but no marks on her. they wound up taking both of us to jail. they took her because they saw scratches and hand prints on my face and neck and they took me...because she said I beat her  but she couldn t show them a single mark on her.some people just aren t wired up right. their thought processes make no sense. on the other hand  some people are just plain evil by nature.when I got away from her I never looked back.
amber lies so often thatshe easily qualifies to get hired as the next white house press secretary.

first to comment
just because you were raised to be a gentleman  doesnt mean you have to take her abuse. you have the right to defend yourself no matter what.
@onemanarmy36  yeah maybe so  but she got too high one night and let her plans slip out. she wanted me  to beat her. she thought if she could get me put in jail for a felonious assault  my parents would support her financially and my future would be ruined. it turns out she did something similar to her first husband and his parents supported her until they realized what kind of monster she really was. from what I understand she attempted the same thing on the guy she hooked up with after me. we had mutual friends that warned him before he fell into her trap. I dont know where she is now  but she s at the age where her looks are starting to fail her  so hopefully fewer guys will blindly fall into her trap.
