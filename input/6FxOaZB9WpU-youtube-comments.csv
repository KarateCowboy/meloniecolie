at this point you never know if the girl youre playing games with is normal and well-adjusted or a crazy psycho brainwashed feminist. and its always important to remember the difference between a gun and a feminist  a gun only has one trigger.
I remember I got queued up with 3 random girls in cod and opposite team was obviously all guys. they threw your typical  go back to the kitchen   go make me a sandwich  and in my head Im like  I hope these girls dont break  then booom!  why dont you go build a hous !   yeah! go mow the lawn cash cow   go pay the rent  walking bank!   you sound like you run outta breath getting up from bed and I just sat back like a proud big brother who just watched all his sisters graduate college.so yes  a lot these girls can hang and just a loud minority of them are ruining it for everyone.
Ive been a gamer for 20 years and have experienced overwhelming inclusion  and as well as my fair share of roasting and smacktalk  which is fun to dish back. and yes  the men are equally  if not more  ruthless to each other. if someone doesnt want to play with me for whatever reason  how is that my business  its not like we re short on players.
I was s assaulted at 16 by a female peer and avoid interacting with women online when Im not with a friend group. its so bonkers guys cant even avoid women if they re uncomfortable
to honest  I blame parents for treating their daughters like a princess. a guy at my work has 3 sons. and he said he would treat his daughter better than his boys. because apparently all daughters have to be a Goddamn princess. while boys are just boys.
my last experience with a verbally abusive female guild officer left me scarred and its a shame because I know there are good women out there but the rotten hags are driving men away from women. they call you a pickme because they are skipmes and probably evil narcissists too
guy  talks to womensjws   leave women alone  stop harassing female gamers guy  ignores women and mutes emsjw   reeeee he just wants to silence women and doesnt want them to speak
guys aren t gonna want to play with us . there s something really sad about the simplicity and childlike innocence of thatstatement.
its not even fear of being framed as misogynistic or sexist... its the helplessness of being unable to do anything about it. at least  thats how it is for me. it matters not  quite literally  what you do or say  or dont do or dont say  as to them  it can be misconstrued as some form of harassment or sexism in some roundabout  connect four  reverse psychology hidden deep within me that I just somehow never realized.that is why I love the jordan peterson quote  tell me what you want me to do  and I ll do it   because modern men have no fucking idea. we re fine with playing by your rules as respectful law abiding individuals  but only when the game is fair  with clear rules of engagement. if the rules are  Imade it the fuck up  and  I can change the rules whenever I fancy to suit me and mine against you   why would we bother  its useless to bother to care. if you disagree  then ask yourself  if the roles were reversed  would you
these girls who hop on twitter trying to make it like all girl gamers are victims thats the absolute state of twitter and woke blogs like kotaku. they spend all of their time trying to gaslight the public into believing problems that they themselves make up out of thin air. this encapsulates their lives entirely.
the worst thing Ive noticed with my exes that played games  was they got so emotional if they were bad at a multiplayer game and ruined it for everyone else by crying  getting upset  or just not talking anymore because they re bored and annoyed. I never understood thatshit. my guy friends are better at some games than me and vice versa.. and its the main thing we joke about with each other lol.
Imarried a gamer girl 15 years ago. wouldn t have a wife any other way!
goes well beyond gaming. the workforce is like this as well. why risk getting slandered  fired  and permanently blacklisted
this was unexpectedly solid melonie  your self-awareness and capacity to almost play mediator between both women and men on this matter was really solid.
I do remember hearing about the ninja thing a while back. I believe the issue wasn t that his wife just didn t want him gaming with girls. the issue was the rumors that would start about him and any girl he played with  which would always happen with someone that famous. I would also find it a bit absurd if someone told their spouse they couldn t play games with the opposite sex. I can understand also understand why it would be hurtful for her to go online and see people talking everywhere about her husband with another woman.
as a girl  I dont even tell people I play video games anymore
hang or mute  is such good advice. back when I was a kid  I was super sensitive and of course I had thatsqueaky ass voice  so  squeaker  was an immediate response after I said anything. I got my feelings hurt a few times and just decided to mute my mic when I played with people I didn t know. just like that  I didn t get my feelings hurt anymore. its soooo easy to avoid the toxicity and  toxicity  if you dont want to be affected by it. as an adult  I have tons of fun talking trash and having it thrown back at me. it just took time for me to realize that none of it was personal.
honestly you have the best channel Ive ever heard. I love that you also incorporate some of your faith into your talks and read off Bible verses because sometimes I think people get scared of sharing that with other people. also I love gaming. I dont get to do it as often now that I have kids but every once in a while me and my husband will sit down and play diablo or cod or something like that and have an absolute blast. completely agree about guys talking smack. this is what they do when they re playing games. and its not just video games. I remember my brother s being absolutely brutal to me playing monopoly  risk and football. and I loved it. most of the time I laughed at the jokes. people get so easily offended these days.
it is never about equality.  it is about control.
people like this girl are worth keeping. she will make some good guy happy because she is using her brain and that is rare in this age.
well said.
tbf normal women feel the same. I do.
@der magnus  facts
perhaps  but wouldn t playing expose that  Imean  getting comfortable and paying attention to what kind of outbursts occur should tell a person everything they need to know  wouldn t it !!full disclosure  Im a female gamer and my outbursts include   no! no! noooo!  and  awww maaan! pffffttt!
truth! very true. I am an old school gamer. early 2000s we were always wanting girl gamers and the idea was kinda hot. when they got on  they would trash talk with the best of em. not a single woke ass feminist cause that wasn t a thing then. gamers were a culture all their own just like punks and goths and it included everybody. all inclusive cause gaming was a lifestyle that didn t know colors or sex or anything. all gamers and would be gamers welcome. seems like this woke agenda is trying to divide us gamers too. so keep preaching truth. amen.
@jesten moosman  exactly
or a femboy with a very feminie voice.
@raggmopp 3377  Ive seen many streamers get backlash because they said something to a female gamer that they normaly said to a male gamer  but she called it mysogeny. I think even that ninja guy suffered from it. for them its safer to not play with them on streams
well  yes and no.  there are some guns that have more than one trigger  but the amount of triggers a gun has  is always going to be lower than the amount of triggers a feminist has
@raggmopp 3377  same except Im  a dude and include a few curse words here and there and maybe some weird noises of me holding my breath or something  although when I play with randos in voice chat Im usually chill
loud majority. it is the same for guys however.
rad white knighting bra...
that is just average day in any competitive game. men bash each other just as bad if not worse than women. what sucks is a decent person will laugh about it later and assholes will not. when it is only men insulting women and not both then you actually have a reason to fuss at men and the inverse is also true. simply put if ye wanted to be treated nicely treat others nicely.
why y all trippin bruh  lol. Im just stating that they can dish it. just this new wave of gamer girls just ruining it. I get that the guys get super competitive but Im just keeping an open mind gentlemen.
@gabe o  dawg  im rollin! I had no clue there was an emojI like that!
@myusertubeaccount  haha I actually just spotted it myself  so thats my first time using it. I dont know what its really supposed to be  but it was a perfect fit for what I was looking for lol
@gabe o  totally! damn white knights!
going to be honest. those aren t even insults. one is building a shelter you can live in. one is making money. the last has money to spend.  compared to  make a sandwich  they just aren t good. hell even compliments to some.
omfg. I am never that quick witted!! good for them. my favorite tactic in cod for shit-talkers is just just smile and nod and act like I dont know what Im doing and then knife kill anyone who joined in  while going   hahah  how am I doing this  babe! what button am I pushing to use the knife  I was never really offended  but Im not quick enough to quip  so I ll just dunk instead.
@raggmopp 3377  why risk it  if I set myself on fire I know it will hurt  Im not going to do it just to make sure. a man cant tell which women are going to try to wreck his life at the drop of a hat  so he is safest just avoiding all of them.
and they never know if the guy they re playing with is well adjusted or a complete psychopath.
@raggmopp 3377  thats great if you are able to give somebody your undivided attention. I dont think thats always possible in that type of environment. and thats assuming the person is raised to recognize those types of queues
@beauregard rippey  its the same way for either gender  and so what if they are   you can mute them and or ignore them
@andy keenan  exactly but  in case you hadn t noticed there has been a campaign raging to abolish personal responsibility
damn.

@jesten moosman  not trying to divide us  its already been done for a while now  unfortunately.
lol
@daniel simmons  there are so  sooo many too. its just downright bizarre.
hahaha love it
not sure what its like in the us. but a lot of the victimhood stuff is taught in schools. then when women get out in to the real world they dont know whats going on.
@ianes gr cia  are you serious  being called a name is a problem  didnt we all survive elementary school and junior high
sir   show me you driver licence and papers  do you happen to have feminist open carry permit
@david silva  you ve all convinced me and I agree! damn shame  though.
we dont even ask for sanity. just no special pleading.
@beauregard rippey  in this day and age if you call someone the wrong pronom is reasong to be a problem  so... yeah.
@raggmopp 3377  agreed. its a shame that this is the state of mind we have today. the cancel culture and victmism are very on high and I just hope that this change soon
@raggmopp 3377  yeh but by the time you find out that person is a raging feminist you could find yourself recorded and on twitter with people calling for your cancellation because you said  get rked  to an enemy and have thatsnowflake feel offended because someone else said that to her 3 months ago lol. I personally find gamer girls wholesome and Im fully aware there s a small percentage of snowflakes who ruin it for the majority
actually  that depends on the gun.
@ianes gr cia  its because a lot of these girls start playing games to get male attention and are shocked when they get trash talked from them.  they take it personal which means they are obviously gaming for the wrong reason.  I see it all the time.
nah they both have triggers... a guns trigger needs a bit of pressure to fire off.
@eternal champ   .... Im fully aware there s a small percentage of snowflakes who ruin it for the majority.  unfortunately  thatseems to apply to everything!
that needs to be a quote
dont some types of guns also have a safety function to engage  another difference as well.
my side-by-side shotgun has two triggers tho
technically some double barrels have two triggers. but I get your point
very well said
you forgot that guy that plays as a girl in games  there be gajillions of them I tell ya.!
same  is safer to assume they are all feminist  it is healthy  no  but its safer  yes.so ladies  stop being the silent majority
same goes in the workplace. Im professional with women at work  but I would never socialize with them  and even avoid being alone with them where possible.
sadly  these types are very good at hiding their crazyness.
@jesten moosman  but back then it was also a higher bar for entry because openly being a gamer often came paired with being social outcasts towards anyone else who wasn t also a gamer  it was something to get bullied over by outsiders. as a result more men than women ended up being gamers because not straying from social cohesion was naturally more important to women. and there were a few women who played games  but in the end they were gamers  though sometimes a bunch of weirdoes would make a big deal out of it because they were effectively social outcasts  thus having a women be on level with them was something that was special.        the current iteration of   girl gamers  are people who actively set themselves apart from just gamers   and often want the space to be changed to suit them   and to be welcomed. to enjoy the privilidges and extra consideration that comes with being a woman.     the problem is that old school gamers are still that group of people that know what it was like to be bullied for liking their hobby and will take none of that. why accept in the people who worked to make them outcasts in the first place    like come into the space to play games but if thats not what you are here for then buzz of.
I run of the basis that they are all feninists. and then after getting to know then I can let rip
lol well said
the difference between a gun and a feminist  a gun only has one trigger.  thats brilliant man  chefs kiss
and the gun only shoots where it is pointed  not necessarily where its aimed  but whatever   the feminist shoots off on all the men and all the reasonable women who call their bullshit.
I think  normal and well-adjusted it not the best description of any gamer   awesome but not normal
those are the best kind of girls to play video games with. when everyone cantalk shit it makes gaming so much better.
that is amazing!
@the frontier  and making a sandwich is providing sustenance to eat  not an insult either  technically. totally fits in with the rest of the smack talk.
@tahlia nerds out  everyone can make a sandwich  can you build a house
@the frontier  Im confused about what that has to do anything  its smack-talk dunking with gender-based stereotypes. they dont need to be exact equivalents  none of it is meant seriously. it was just in-the-moment fun that they all enjoyed with no hurt feelings
dont loose your cool or you will start to make a lot of bad decisions.
@gabe o  I think its a fencer.
building a house  having money  and paying bills are insults  now  lol
@mr. wombatt  well  knowing how to cook isn t bad too tho.
you say that  but men dont get articles written about how they experience harassment in gaming. women perpetuate victim narratives  men do not.
guys guys guys.... I am not against you. I know what you guys are saying. Im just saying I dont like how these new wave gamer girls are ruining it for the girls who can actually hang.
thats stuff women normally say to men  though.  it doesnt count as trash talk when its just more of the usual.
@midgetydeath  most entries into the trash talking is low hanging fruit you know  someone on the opposite end  idk what they look like  size  hair  face  etc. I just go off with what I know. I hear a female start trashing I start with the basic  go make me a sandwich  and it amps up from there.
yall dont hate on this man for relaying a story. damn. everyone so pissy about everyone saying stuff.you all live in basements and dont know what a woman looks like without clothes on. stop playing.
@maggie m  back when I used to play the modern warfare games and halo  I d s -talk and argue with people all day night. I wouldn t be able to now  but man was that fun. the internet rotted my brain. Im not witty anymore.
I was in sot a few years ago doing a fleet  ran into some female players and we were all chill sold the loot and went out sperate ways not sure why its become so taboo to avoid female gamers
@raggmopp 3377   full disclosure  Im a female gamer and my outbursts include   no! no! noooo!  and  awww maaan! pffffttt!   watch your tongue  missy!
@cy-one
dude  well said!
most guns only have one trigger....there are actually exceptions
in my experience most normal women aren t play video games. which leaves the latter.
bruh that applies to guys too xd online gaming is filled to the brim with ignorant  crazy and mal adjusted people. why are we acting as if this is exclusively a woman thing
@raggmopp 3377  kinda missing the whole point.
@beauregard rippey  he is 100  serious because thats exactly what s happening! did you not pay attention to the entire video
@theia_loki  depends on the gun. one famous design  called the 1911  has a grip safety.  there is a switch built into the grip of the gun  you have to squeeze the grip hard enough to press it before the gun will fire.personally  I dont like this design  because of your hands aren t big enough  you can have a hard time keeping thatswitch pressed to make the gun work.
@red head guy  since this was 7 months ago I doubt Imissed the point and youre only referring to something that was part of a longer conversation.
@raggmopp 3377  you keep insisting that men should have to play against gamer girls simply because their behavior would give them away.the point is that leaves men exposed to false accusations from girls!
@red head guy  no I didn t. in fact I can understand perfectly why fellas would want to avoid the drama. kinda sad  some of us enjoy playing with a mixed group  but who wants to have to watch what they say or walk on eggshells with a bunch of perpetually perturbed prima-donnas. egad!
@raggmopp 3377  oh  so you do get it.  okay  no worries then.at least as far as you and I are concerned.
honestly any gamer man or woman could be a psycho  crazy unsportsman like personcod lobbies come to mind.
@chandler burse  thats true. and these days everyone is just waiting to be offended so they complain and get someone banned.  itsucks the fun out of it.
haha!  love that!   a gun has only one trigger !
@princess marlena  unless its a double barrel.
@chandler burse  yes  the fact that Ive run into so many nuts in multiplayer games is why I stick to single player these days.
@red head guy  sometimes I think I am a bit of a nut because I argue with toxic people too much over games its pointless never achieve anything but I guess it does relieve some stress. and cause it. but jeez its hard not to wonder why people cant just let people like or dislike what they want or play how they want if they aren t cheating who gives a crap if they wanna camp or whatever.
be sure to ask questions  women make it pretty easy who they are if you know what to say
I dont find that to be a problem on siege
@mrs. h.l. g-b  its a shame that all 36 of you normal women are hard to find.
sticks and stones may break my bones  but there ll always be something to offend a feminist.  - an internet legend.
@rassil krishnan  I play solo and haven t group played in years - so dont know where this is coming from. if you are speaking generally - no duh! I wouldn t want to play with a bunch of narcissistic a-holes either.
@coco calypso  this is a sexist take  not only that but its also completely unfounded.
@donhaka  I was simply stating what Ive experienced.  clearly  you ve had different experiences and thats ok.
@coco calypso  can you describe how you have experienced this  have you asked around and gotten these answers from women  did they specifically say that they play games cuz they want attention
same exact thing in real life.you simply never know.so I do the safe thing  and dont interact with any females whatsoever.I love my career  Ive made a strong name for myself in it  and I get paid well for it. there isn t a female on this planet thats worth losing that over. not even close.
@daniel simmons  oh hell no..
I dont think feminists play video games...
every person you ve ever played a video game with is a crazy psycho
@jesten moosman  Ive been playing games since the early 2000s as well video games are so different back then where you could say wherever you wanted and somebody would say something they want to say right back everybody was equal no way was calling you a racist or sexist every time you said something nobody on the other end liked they just laughed about it because they knew you were joking
agreed and glad af that if I want to game with women I can send one message and have a group of 10 to 15 who are happy to and we can just chat game and relax with at least one or two on a weekly basis
I haven t played many games in recent years  but a few years ago when I stopped they were already implementing things for team killing. if the game doesnt have restrictions to prevent it  and youre playing with a feminist  just team kill her until she quits. lol.
@sattorI emei  idk how many of them play  but some certainly do.
likely the latter
this isnt the point of the comment but some old double barrels have 2 triggers
