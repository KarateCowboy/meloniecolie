thank you for this video!19 15 I left because I was already dealing with some issues involving my family that I had moved from utah to nevada for.  I had even retired just six months before for this very reason  but avalanche asked me to continue working remote and out of state.when these stories dropped about my old youtube channel  it put a lot of pressure on me both at home and at the workplace.  so  I decided to  jump on my own grenade   take pressure off the studio and focus on those family issues instead.  I voluntarily re-retired.since then  things with my family greatly improved. so now Ive been playing lots of video games and cheerleading hogwarts legacy s coming release!  its gonna be great!
these wokies have ruined dc and marvel  so the fact that harry potter has completely made them meltdown makes me want this game more.
Im jewish and I heard about that goblin thing before I think its weird that people are even calling it antisemitic. its also weird how the woke all the sudden care about antisemitism when it works in their favor its usually the one subject they shy away from calling out
when streaming this game gets you a sh!t load of views and a bunch of revenue  you will find all these  woke  streamers do their mental gymnastics to justify why they are buying streaming it  you can expect something along the lines of  I am supporting the developers    rowling only get a tiny cut of the profits    I never said I will not buy it  etc...
wokies are professionals with being angry  thanks for the content mel  glad you are doing well.
luna lovegood she s the most redpilled character in the book because she always knows what s really going on and nobody takes her seriously. and the real life actress is based and supported jk. so yeah  youre luna alright.
its hilarious how the woketards dont realise the more they ree the more popular hogwarts legacy becomes.
yes  I am tired of this dictating what everyone can or cant do. its very annoying. my parents allowed us to read harry potter when we were growing up because they said when you get out in the real world youre going to find people who believe differently than you and you need to know what you believe in why and how to be respectful to other people. we didn t get into it major I only read the first four books watched a couple movies  but that was it.
I could definitely see you as a luna lovegood  she s one of my favorite characters and she s really into conspiracies and finding out the truth. ppl think she s crazy but a lot of the stuff she talks about is true
when you have jk rowling money  you cant be canceled.
if people cant separate the art from the artist then thats their fault. the developers have poured their hearts into this game and I will definitely support them
once they started going reeeeeee!!!! last year  I immediately bought the deluxe edition
to be woke is to be angry at everything  always.  also  I forgot to get my pre-order in.  this reminded me and now I have the deluxe edition because wtf  why not...
I didn t get into the harry potter books until  6 was already out. someone ended up leaving  1 on the table I was sitting at in the library so I just read a little bit of it to see if I d actually like it. read all 6 in less than a month and bought  7 the day it came out. had to have my grandma drive me to 3 stores to find the damn thing lol.
I seem to remember another author  years ago  who wrote a bestselling book about a man  who wanted to be a woman  who killed woman for some reason....I think they made an award winning movie based on the book  with an all-star cast that also launched a series of other movies involving one the characters....wish I could remember the name  wait  didn t he like to eat people  didn t his name rhyme with the term for someone who eats people  wasn t there something about lambs  and weird moths  what was the name of thatstory! ! !
thanks for this video  melonie!I knew that jk rowling was likely one of the reasons for the apparent outrage for the hogwarts legacy video game pre-order. itstill baffles me that the very author who wrote one of the most popular franchises of all time is being attacked from all angles  even from those who benefited from her work.  rowling was at one point considered to be wealthier than the late queen  so .....maybe there s a lot of envy.....
instantly subscribed thank you so much for putting this out there  I understand harry potter isn t for everybody but I have been a fan since I was a child it was the first book I read  oddly enough it wasn t even the first book lol  and watched every movie in theaters including the fantastic beats movies. seeing what the woke people have done to one of my all time favorite franchises like getting fantastic beats getting jonny depp removed from cast and practically stop production of the movies entirely to seeing them try to stop one of the best games for people like me to come out just makes me so sad. watch what you want  read what you want  play what you want  but dont try to make other do only what you deem to be right in your eyes thats so narcissistic and the whole left is full of them and its pathetic.
Im glad youre feeling better melonie
never been a harry potter fan  but there is something about this game that calls out to me. not pre-ordering it but Im definitely considering getting itsoon after launch.
I read the first 4 books when I was a child  didn t have much interest in continuing after that  I stopped reading as much in general  probably mostly due to video games  and then I watched the first 5 movies and I was pretty happy with them but Ive never been a superfan of any kind  my interest in the movies was mostly just due to having read and enjoyed the first 4 books. thatsaid... the setting of the harry potter universe is incredibly cool and has a ton of potential  especially if it is untethered from the stigma of harry s story. Ive heard good things about the game that caught my attention and I see the potential. I probably wont pre-order but I ll definitely be paying attention and may buy week 1 if early reviews are good and the game seems stable.
thank you so much for leaving a comment and clearing all that up! Im so sorry the mob came after you  especially when you had family issues you were already trying to deal with. but Im happy to see that all is well now and that you are supporting the game s launch! God bless you and your family!
the woke mob doesnt represent the vast majority of gamers or people in general
I try my best to stay away from stuff centered around magic and sorcery. unsurprisingly  they inspire people  especially the youth  to be witches and mages while putting magic in a positive light  which is not good. this is from a biblical perspective  of course. now  as far as each individual  believer  is concerned  they can only do as much as the holy spirit allows them. the unbeliever will also do what seems right unto he she.
@melonie mac go boom   woke turns everything to shite. I was not gonna buy that game but I think I have to now. or buy even more than 1 copies of that game. 100  against woke maniacs.
good to hear  bud
@lliw brown  all nonsense by the way.
glad youre doing well  everything that happened to you was bs.absolutely looking forward to the game.
thanks for putting that idiocracy to rest in your own words.
really sorry you went through all that  troy.... glad things are getting better for you and your family
and sony and it look s like rockstar too
warner bros. games is woke. you are paying your enemies to ruin your hobby.
dont forget they ruined star wars and Lord of the rings .
@greaseball_gamer .doesnt lucasfilm disney own star wars  not wboh wait nvm. reread and understood what you meant
wokeism destroys everything even the series we like star wars  harry potter  dc  marvel  it goes on and on woke stuff ruins everything in its power.
looks like a nice game tbh  Im neutral in the culture war though  so I can enjoy all the games lol
Im glad harry potter ended before all the woke bs. that franchise was lucky to start off in 2001.
@greaseball_gamer  not lotr   they ruined rop and that got nothing to do whit Lord of the rings.
@arabellaa  ya just meant franchise that where turned to garbage and woke .
lets see  so far they ruiened  or tried to ruin  franchises and releases  like    dc  marvel  dr. who  star trek  star wars  Lord of the rings   saints row   d d   ghostbusters that one luckily failed miserably  and anything that disney put out in the past in there reboots . did Imiss anything
@samI the smooth  do keep in mind that you d be giving your money to a studio who proudly announced repeatedly that jk rowling wasn t involved in the creative process of this game  just to appease the woke mob - and much good it did them  itseems  given thatso  many  still reee on twitter about it.
Im happy to hear your family is doing better!
@@samithesmooth2970  just to inform you  this game is woke. it has  inclusive  character creation where you dont pick male or female but body and voice options and then what dorm you ll sleep in  they ve already done what they canto placate those on tweeter even though they wont buy it and want it boycotted so either way its gone bad.
@th3professor  shame they decided to keep on the esg train even though they know that those they are trying to placate will not buy it and want it gone.
glad that you and your family are doing better  sir. cant wait to play the game when its released
troy leavitt is great I loved his pro gamergate stuff
@lliw brown  fair enough  thats a reasonable stance to take  but Im curious  with regards rpgs and the fantasy genre in general  where do you stand with clerics  paladins and holy magic  or miracles    a lot of games feature divine powers which player characters cantap into or utilise  often in the cause of good fighting evil.  there is definitely a continuation of the c.s. lewis  manichean take on fantasy in gaming  and more broadly certain branches of more modern fantasy fiction.
Im so sorry these things have happened to you. it looks to be an amazing game and I look forward to playing it. I wish you  the studio  and everyone else involved  -health  safety  happiness  and great success. success is the best revenge!! may God bless you and your family!
@melonie mac go boom  Im looking forward to playing this game. and on a side note. I dont know if you get this a lot but you do not look like you are in your 30 s at all. when you said that a few videos ago I was shocked. I guessed you were in your early 20 s and usually Im pretty good with ages. so congratulations. may you always stay young!
Im happy that you and your family are doing much better  mr. leavitt. I hope you had a merry Christmas and a happy new year  and I hope you enjoy this game as much as I plan to.
was the character creator in the game always meant to exclude choice of your character s sex  gender  any mention of them and allowance for masculine looking character builds to identify as witches
@charming peasant  you can still choose your gender. witch or wizard. that was shown off in the character creator. you can just make whatever campy joke character you want as well. people grabbed ahold of that narrative thanks to journalists running with it and are treating it as fact.
@the dragon s lair  I doubt its meant to be a joke  the devs were very serious about presenting the game as   inclusive  .
@charming peasant  you still have to choose witch or wizard. you can just make whatever character you want. that can be inclusive  or it can be a huge joke character that you choose to make.the choice is yours in how you approach creating your character.
@the dragon s lair  thats just your cope trying to defend a regressive character creator that is meant to appease the unappeasable.
@abnon-tha  good question  but there s a difference between a game movie etc..that features magic  and one thats centered around it. if I cant progress without it  thats where I end the game. what s important  however  is the heart  as well as one s fear and love  or lack thereof  for God. to fear God is to hate evil. Im also not familiar with c.s. lewis  manichean  or their takes for that matter.
@lliw brown  interesting perspective.  manichean is a concept  Imust here refer you to suggest  the diabolical instrument known as google  which will explain all and save me some typing .c.s. lewis I highly recommend if youre into fantasy but prefer storytelling from a strong Christian perspective.  Im not personally religious  but I like the idea of the genre being a broad church  so to speak  in which everyone can find something to appeal to them.anyway this is taking the thread on a slight tangent  apologies... thats it from me...
holy shit  its been a damn long time since I saw your videos  I subscribed to your account a while ago because you discussed some very interesting topics
@jason henry  you are absolutely right half of them dont even play video games at all so I really ain t taking no criticism from somebody who dont even play games at all
you did nothing wrong.  ever.
I promise you only the people on twitter care about this stuff. tiktok seems to be hyped for this game
I always loved your videos  ever since aneta sarkezean  or whatever how you spell it .truth to be told  I was never a harry potter fan but this game genuinely interested me. seeing people in social media trying to shame others into now playing  making accusations of  transphobia  did make me pull the trigger and get a copy just to rub it in their faces.but Im no liar  and that game looks genuinely good! which is the main factor in my purchase.I wish you and your family good health  and all good in this world. _
@lliw brown  I consider the Bible one of the first magic   sorcery books. Imean. angels  holy powers  walking on water  turning water to wine  splitting the red sea. standard fantasy and magic things.
good for you.  I strongly look forward to your work.  both myself and my daughter.  this is a truly cross-generational game.
@melonie mac go boom  what mob came for him. . .internet trolls  grow up.
exactly. Im tempted to buy the deluxe edition now. f the woke gargoyles.
@abdullah shabaneh  sony  tlou is one of the wokest games out there  aswell as tv series by the looks of it.
@hughjaenus  yeah thats why Im calling it woke
@abdullah shabaneh  my bad  I thought you meant sony and tlou are like hogwarts legacy
@jay sullivan  if its a good game its a good game... under that logic you are ruining your favorite ips because your assuming that non gamers supporting or boycotting a game is inevitably going to destroy it....these people crying about jk and her opinions are too busy scouring the internet for the next offensive tweet or tictok to hate not buying or playing video games only we can ruin it by buying into their bs and not buying the game either because then it will underperform and the dev. s or their overLords will assume that they need more woke nonsense in their games to get them to sell... remember they can say anything they want but at the end of the day the   wins so vote for what you want by buying the games doing the things you d like to see and not the ones that you dont when everyone in the gaming community does this we will get what we want and the poor management of these companies will loose money for their companies and get fired or demoted until the right people are put in charge and great games return
@ashersdad1    youre not making any sense. the company is woke  and you would be making them more successful  giving them a reason to not change fix the problem.     the game isn t anti-woke. so  youre simply giving them more time in charge of a company. youre not sending them any message other than   see  we can be successful!      the funniest part is that the game doesnt even look good. youre desperately trying to excuse your poor behavior so that you can play a boring game. if the game were mocking woke culture  I could excuse people giving them money and expecting the wokeness to go away  but its not doing that. youre basically reading one of those articles thatsay   ign and kotaku aren t woke   and then youre giving your money to ign and kotaku. they re both woke  but the sjws are never satisfied until everything a company does caters to them.
I agree I agree
I got the collector s edition
@jarno brofelt  rop  I dont even think that actually exists. never heard of it. lotr is perfect though.
@jack sparrow  rop is just bad fan fiction.
fax
@mary winchester unfortunately jk rowling listens to tumblr not 4chan
@ka-ka-kannath ya let s just do a reverse boycott and just buy everything they dont like
@jolly jack gang    wow  you totally showed them! they re not going to be making woke games anymore  now that you ve given them a lot of money! wait  dont they now have more money- your money -to use on making woke games
@jolly jack gang    keep giving your enemies your money and trying to convince yourself that youre not a part of the problem  I guess. I ll be here  alone  having principles and standing up for what s good. when Im dying  I wont be thinking about how I could have spent  70 on a game that funded a company trying to destroy my country and culture.
how  I think the problem with games is the game industry itself
they are ruining everything!!
@mermidion  the last of us.
@abdullah shabaneh  sony
@hughjaenus  tlou is not woke at all
ya forgot star wars franchise
@mermidion  you left out the sims 4  all the previous games are awesome but sims 4 is a hot woke mess but then again its ea so its not exactly unexpected.
and doctor who  and star wars and star trek and willow and so on so on so on
the meltdown from liberals makes me want this game even more
@the unsolved wizard  so you basically support jk rowling s bigotry.
dont forget the rings of power  halo  everything enjoyed by people that dont share thier values  or lack of   they feel the need to destroy. luke skywalker  and that awful rian johnson he did it on purpose.
@greaseball_gamer  wheel of time too
@mermidion  witcher  wheel of time
dont forget star wars they ruined it too
@mermidion halo
@dragon ball fans cant read what happened to believe all women and slay queen slay  I guess it doesnt apply when they dont fall in line with the message.
@geeebuttersnap maybe make sense
@dragon ball fans cant read  nah  I dont think I will.
they have ruined the whole gaming and movie industry already.
no you got everything on the list
@the unsolved wizard  dramatic
I bought it because I wanted itsince its hp and people loose their minds
@kopperneoman  but its also disrespectful how the woke compare a lot of things to nazism like I dont think when trump was in office there were concentration camps etc  so people need to chill on all that
at one hand they are like  free palestina  and  anti-zionist   on other hand they are like  dont be anti-semitic!  and  goblins have big noses - they must be jews  so it is anti-semitic to have goblins in your stories! .
in the film it was weird because they showed the star of david in gringotts  but I dont think jk meant to be antI semitic in the books. she just read about goblins in mythology being theives and made them bankers... she s not cleverer than that
bro ive actually never noticed that  thank you  its gonna make my gameplay more enjoyable
world of warcraft has pretty much the same exact features for their goblins. while blizzard has its issues no one has ever brought this up against them.
the people that automatically associate the goblins with jews are the bigots not the people who created the characters.
also there are some morally good goblins in the game too.
@melassia  in film it is because in an actual bank where they were doing the filming - it was there.
@bigplayquay  hm  acting against antisemitism is a historical left agenda point. but its more an european left thing than a us thing. Im german and around here the left is completely blind to any controversy within the jewish community. actually let me correct that. thats actually a stand taken by the majority of the population. at the very least  it makes some kind of sense from the german european pov  we are very aware of what our ancestors did and we absolutely dont want to be likened to the past germany at all. i.e. if you look at the isreal and palestine conflict. israel could throw a nuclear bomb towards palestine and the majority of the european left would just shuffle their feet  look at the ground and mumble  but... we cant judge jews... . anything that doesnt glorify jews or israel is considered antisemitic. in the last few years the left of the us exported lots of viewpoints towards the european left  it was just a matter of time until the european left starts influencing the us ones.
yeahI guess you know  why
@grim meowning  are u really saying  free palestine  as a negative thing  ur comment a straight l.
of course they dont call out antisemitism  they invented it.
@grim meowning  you can want to free palestine while asking people to not be antI semitic at the same time lol
they re literally telling on themselves
bahahaha its true tho!
the people who call themselves  allies  will definitely be saying that lol

failures of parenting
when I read  mel  I thought of mel gibson.
haha
oh heck yes  I love this! haha!
isn t her father the alex jones in the harry potter universe
its funny because most of what they do is out of spite
gotta love the streisand effect
doom eternal was all the rage
im one who will buy just out of spite. I am a fan of hp but usually stay away from full price triple a games. stick to more of  20- 30 indie type stuff but ill make an exception on this one.
they were fine with jd loosing his role but they get mad because of a video game.
I didn t know about the game at all   now I keep hearing about it lol
I think this is super exaggerated by a few people... Im not nazI at all and Im super looking forward to the game.
@nathan beales  dude same the first time I heard of the game was a  dont buy hogwarts legacy  tweet and my first response was  omg theres another harry potter lore game coming out!!! instant preorder  lol
yes how dare former fans denounce jk rowling for being a transphobe.
@dragon ball fans cant read  she had weird statements for sure and transphobia is a terrible disease... but honestly  she doesnt actively participate in transphobic actions and the art she made doesnt contain it. this game was also developed and sold by completely different people.Im not a nazI like most people here  but I wont stop loving harry potter because jk made some statements that are in bad taste.
doesnt matter. the game is woke either way. they bent the knee a year ago
@john dodo  I agree  hogwarts legacy doesnt look like a nazI game at all.
@luka stemberger  finally I found a normal personim tired of these far left people acting like jk rowling personally made this game. im also tired of these far right people jumping in and just being annoying and blowing up the situation as if tons of people are mad when its a few
@luka stemberger  yeah rowling didn t make it but the hp brand is synonymous with her.there were trans kids who grew up looking up to her and loving hp.not everyone can separate creation from the creator.
@dragon ball fans cant read  problem is  its important to pick your battles. if you push too hard on an ignorant tweet  you get a strong pushback from extremists... I dont see any of her art being questionable  so I wont stop enjoying it. you cant just erase people s childhoods enjoying the wizarding world... I will call out her tweets as ignorant though. not everything is black and white.
@luka stemberger  I didn t say her creation was questionable even if she is trying hard to sabotage it with retcons.but I understand why some fans  including her trans audience  would not want to support anything further.personally  I stopped caring about harry potter long before rowling outed herself as a terf.
@dragon ball fans cant read  thats totally fine. youre ok to not care for it. and others are ok to care for it. win-win
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  is the most satisfying sound on earth.
@clark kent  nice strawman and Im not trans so calling me moon pie in an effort to offend me was quite pathetic.sex and gender are two different things as established by science.something you and bigotowling dont understand.
haha that does sound like me
love luna one of my favs
@melonie mac go boom luna is unironically best girl too tho
jkr money  and an iron grip on her ip.  every movie ticket  game or piece of merchandise that is sold  jkr gets paid  and there s nothing the angry weirdos can do about it
@legionsteve  heck  contracts are being written differently now because of j.k. rowling s contract regarding harry potter and the wizarding world. her contract is so iron-clad that the rules have been changed to keep it from happening again for future creators.
@the dragon s lair  thats the only thing thatsucks  the corporations want to make sure they acquire at least some undisputed control over any ip they adapt  so its going to be extremely difficult for any future creator to have as much control of their work as rowling does.
thank you wokies now more people are buying hogwarts legacy
it also helps that most of her arguments are quite logical and based on biology  statistics  experiences  and the traditions of a large majority of her readers.
facts
shame.
ayeee
@bne cope
@rotoscope guy  duh  his last three comments on this channel are proof of that.
not even
sounds like a good marketing strategy
oh wait  was she a great big fat person
@auramaster dx   was she  roomy
I think it was called  the sheep shut the f up .
cant help you. racked my brain and all I got was silence.
@noodles doodles  retry percussive maintenance and get back to me!
@auramaster dx  yesh  she wash a big girl  shir.
and the special edition dvd might be packaged with recipe cards. seriously  they did that.
not preordering too  but there s some uncanny vibe about this game that makes me want to buy it
fyI  while I can understand people getting the game to  get back at.  there is still the golden rule of never pre-order a game  especially in current days. I cantell you some things already wrong with it  like exclusive ps5 missions and shops  lack of qudditch and no moral choices for using dark arts spells or unforgivable curses. this isn t even to mention there is w.o.k.e stuff in it like the non-bin options and gnder  stuff.
yep same here. cyberpunk was the last game I pre-ordered and it is going to stay that way. but if the reviews are good  it will definitely go on my buy list.
@arlisongbird  exclusive and small playstation missions that have nothing to do with overall story and are completely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things have always been a thing  ever since ps3 era. so you cannot fault the game for that  its the industry not the game. also in this case it is actually timed exclusive and they stated that it will be available for all platforms something like year after launch or something  and I guarantee it once it comes out you will forget about it as soon as you complete the quest. those exclusive missions are usually very forgettable. second  they couldn t implement quidditch because of how broom flight works mechanically  if you watched latest gameplay showcase there its explained that broom tech is not quite there yet and as such you can go fast for unlimited amount of time only when close to the ground but as soon as you get altitude you start slowing down. so of course there is no quidditch in this game. and about dark arts and unforgivable curses  thats also wrong too. they literally created whole arena dedicated specifically to testing out unforgivable curses and generally forbidden magic to even see if you even want to go that route and gain those spells. if there were no consequences for doing dark magic they wouldn t have created that whole area to literally test forbidden shit consequence free.
@madiq ismal  the pain of playing cyberpunk at launch on an xbox one is something I will never forget.
as a harry potter fan  I d say its worth it based on what Ive seen so far
@@theadrosan  its an interesting horror questline with unique mechanics and a shop with unique gear and prices  sure its a year exclusive  but its still part of the game missing and yes I dont like any exclusives because it just takes away from players.as for quidditch they hinted and showed in the original trailer your character about to fly in quidditch gear  the fact that older hp games could do quidditch says everything  in prisoner of azkhaban game you could fly buckbeak and do quidditch.also  the last of  there is no consequences they ve stated that there is no morality choices or impact by doing so  sure you can learn and use them  but the game world doesnt act around you using them  you dont have characters disapproval or fear.so yes  its less than what was originally shown and said  on top of the  inclusive  additions too.
@arlisongbird  you cannot really compare this game with old harry potter games when it comes to quiddich. those other harry potter games weren t nearly as complex or as open as this one which meant that developing them was easier which also made itso that they can actually spend some time implementing quidditch  that  and the fact that each game was bein made by different developer so they didn t take sequels into consideration while hogwarts legacy probably does because if they use absolutely everything not only does it carry more risk of bein half assed but then you also dont leave anything good for the sequel. and about that morality thing I think you are reffering to them confirming that there will not be black and white morality system like a lot of people thought similar how it is in mass effect but there will definetely be some subtle way of doing itso you dont lock yourself from quests simply for doing pranks on somebody  that kind of thing. I think the consequences will be more mechanics oriented
same. I dont pre-order and I dont know harry potter from harry styles but Im looking forward to this one.
@madiq ismal  never have pre-ordered a game but I did buy duke nukem forever for xbox 360 for  105 aud when it came out and I cant justify spending that much on games anymore lol
this game looks great  regardless of what people say. a norwegian game reviewer freelancing for the state-owned media nrk  norwegian broadcasting corporation  has spent two days on claiming jkr as transphobic without any proof  instead of reviewing games. he has  mixed  opinions on the franchise because of jkr.
cho chang means  melancholy  in chinese.  she did have a  fantasy  name.  it was just in chinese.
also I also didn t really care about harry potter until my step sister finally convinced me to read the books. totally recommend if you are looking to read something. I fell in love after reading. even after watching the first movie.
luna is a good one get  she s an adorable character. its just a shame she was introduced so late in the series.
this makes me want to pre-order it even more!
I didn t even know this game existed.  now its on my steam wishlist
sadly this has been a constant problem. sites Ive visited have constantly pushed  jk is transphobic  every time they ve mentioned the game. Ive faced perma bans from platforms simply supporting jk rowling. r harrypotter gave me this reason for perma banning me   rule 4 - support of jkr s views  as just one example. other places I have been a little less kind towards those those that were more abusive. a lot of moderators seem more sympathetic to those types of people and have the gall to tell others that they need to be more inclusive when those types of people show no form of acceptance towards others. its completely sick and people really need to protect society and their interests.the kicker is that the dev team literally pandered to them by making you able to make a trans character yet its never enough. I have become much more transphobic as a result of modern activism. we re constantly being told that they re just trying to live their lives whist harassing those with the  wrong  opinions  pushing their beliefs onto children  getting them to hide stuff from their parents  hijacking every organisation  controlling people s speech  and blaming other people for mass self deletion if they dare not use their preferred pronouns. I dont understand why a single person would sympathise with them. they are one of the most protected groups of people.what jk rowling has said is nothing compared to what the activists have said to her. dataracer has a nice collection of some of those comments pinned on their twitter.
while Im not a huge harry potter fan  I have enjoyed the series and to be honest hogwart s legacy looks amazing!  I have already planned on getting it  however Ive been debating on whether or not to preorder it  but if its gonna make the woke idiots meltdown Im totally all for preordering it now!
hogwarts legacy  oh how I adoreyour magic and mystery galorethe world you ve created  so immersivemakes me feel like Im truly a part of itbut alas  there are those who are angry and bitterclaiming that the game is a mere twitter litterthey say its offensive  that its done wrongbut to them  I say this  they are mistaken  they re gonefor hogwarts legacy is a delighta chance to experience hogwarts in flighta chance to be a student  to learn and growto embrace the magic  to let it flowso let the haters hate  they ll never understandthe joy that hogwarts legacy has in handfor those of us who love it  its pure blissa magical adventure we wont soon miss
this game wasn t even on my radar until I started seeing these youtube videos discussing the controversy. I haven t really been interested in previous harry potter franchise games  but I checked out the trailers  and wow  this looks like an incredible open world gaming experience in the wizarding world of the harry potter franchise. I will absolutely be buying this game  because it looks like an amazing game. Im not going to base a decision on whether or not I enjoy something on the personal views of anyone involved with it  or someone who in this case wasn t even involved in the making of the game I believe  but they created the franchise of course. the only factors that influence my decision to buy something or not is if I think it looks good and if I think I ll enjoy it. in this case the answer to both of those questions is yes  it looks like a game I d enjoy a lot  so I ll be buying it.
Ive never read the books  and only watched parts of a few movies  but I am getting this game. 1. I found out about it from the internet  haters  but 2. I respect what rowling has done  going from almost nothing to providing for her kids and being one of the highest-paid authors of this generation  not to mention her charities. so  thank you antis for letting me know about this. just like with ghost of tsushima and the musician  issues  made me aware of the game again  I forgot about it  so I bought it when reminded.
you just got a new sub cause of your twitter feed. glad youre like the rest of us and see the game for what is. I am a fanfiction writer  and have subconsciously looking forward to a game like this.
harry potter is filled with Christian symbolism  I remember I went to a Christian high school and my drama teacher was against it because  witchcraft  so I wrote up all the Christian allegories and symbolism from the Bible in harry potter  he was open minded enough to read it and I think it was mildly impressed lol. I ll have to buy pc if I want it early though because I have to wait until april for ps4
Ive never been a harry potter fan  never read the books  watched one of the movies in its entirety on a date around 2006 but dont remember much about it. even so  this game looks really good. doubt I ll buy it but I hope it does well.
I preordered the deluxe edition. really looking forward to it! I was going to get the game after seeing how it performed in reviews but after everyone hanging up on jk for her very sensible views I decided to support this game from the get go. I hate cancel culture.
my 1st comment is Im hesitant to preorder any game  not just because it will likely be buggy  but also the chance it ends up woke. I dont want be supporting anything of thatsort. but Imay take a chance on this one my 2nd comment  Im a big fan of the books-I was introduced to hp back in   98 -my friend who was a mother insisted I give the 1st book a try  which was good enough to hook me in.  I believe I finished the series before jk gave in to the woke mob  I believe this is before the term  woke  was adopted  and retconned dumbledore  which at the time I gave a sigh and ignored. the point is  the books are fantastic but the movies are at best meh. many of the folks commenting here say they are not hp fans probably only watched the movies. a good rule concerning movies adapted from books  the movies almost always suck  but never let a movie discourage one from giving the source material a try. peter jackson s lotr movies are the only movies that come to mind right now as being a rare case of being great adaptations of the books.
pre-ordered the deluxe edition purely out of spite.  insert evil laugh
Im not pre-ordering  but if reviews are as good as I expect I ll definitely get it within the first week month.
Im not a harry potter fan but it looks fun so Im gonna preorder this for the mount on steam to play during my flight back to japan.edit  Im also ordering this because the woke infected hive mind hates it for some reason edit 2  if any of my friends go woke and would betray me  they would only end up like fredo s fishing scene on the Godfather
I pre-ordered two copies of the game for pc. one for me and one for my brother. I cant wait to explore hogwarts and enjoy being in hufflepuff.
same I never cared for the harry potter stories but the the world enviroment was always fasinating to me so digital deluxe here I come
@coldest of nights 56  facts I used to be mad cuz I had assassin creed on xbox and realized that the ps3 ver has exclusives but when I played replayed it on ps3 later on in my cousins house I was like wait thats it
not going to pre-order because my trust level for game companies is depleted. but so far I am liking what I see and if things after launch are good  Im buying it.
norway where a lesbian actress could face years in prison for saying men cant be lesbian s.
same lmao
same
not just the most protected  but most aggressive. they re bullies.
lol support of the artist on a subreddit created for that very artist s work is grounds for a ban. sounds reeee-tarded but this is reddit  so its just another day ending in  y .
it cannot be said often enough   transphobia  is not a thing. its a slur used by bigots against people who do not share their religious beliefs.
@madiq ismal  the irony is that while you say that you can say whatever you want  your comment did get shadow banned. I saw it from being notified hence I can reply  but otherwise I and others cant see your comment.you may notice sometimes when a comment says that it has a certain amount of replies  not all will show.
ok I was with you until you got to  Ive become much more transphobic . dude I get it  I understand the frustration. her views dont matter to me at all and I dont really care either way. but I ll be damned if I let people make me any type of phobic. idk that just seems really weak minded to me .Ive never cared for trans people because if thats how they want to live then its whatever. just dont expect me to be nice to you or cater to you. I will treat you like any other person I dont know. ignore you lol
a phobia is based in fear  not denial or even hate.  arachnophobia  the fear of spiders  is not about a person s hatred of spiders  the hatred might exist because of the initial fear  or the denial of their existence.  the suffix  phobic  is being incorrectly used.  if you aren t afraid of whatever it is attached to  then it does not apply to you.  my fear of heights doesnt mean that I just dont like heights or disagree with them  it means I am actually afraid of them.  I agree with you aside from this point.
@alissa in the wonderland  well the leftist definition of transphobia is simply someone who doesnt affirm them. even trans people are labelled as transphobic if they have the  wrong  beliefs. while I dont apply hate to a race  I do hate leftism. with a passion.
@markel thomas  thats a common occurrence though. I was around during the start of gamergate this culture war and saw dozens of people who claimed to lean left  slowly start going  black pilled  from staring into the abyss too long. many shifted right and started openly spouting racist homophobic shit  its disappointing some folded and now fight hate with hate. Im with you in that regard though  I kinda get it but Im not going to let the ideologues turn me against the many people of different races sexualities that I know are cool and with us in this battle.
respect  is a word wokeists do not know. even if they do use it  they re gonna r-e-s-p-e-c-t aretha franklin singing  respect  because she s a whaman  not otis redding.
dont be fooled into thinking rowling is a good person despite her being correct about the trans issue. I remember a few years back when she called pewdiepie a nazI and tried to cancel him  she s still a leftist.
the ghost  controversy  was hilarious when it turned out japan pointed the devs to that flute player because his teacher was too sick to travel out of japan and he was recognized as the only other grandmaster in existence. japan didn t care he was a white westerner.
@paul el  the greek septuagint Bible translates the word witch in exodus 22 18 as  pharmakia   the root word for pharmaceutical. let thatsink in.
@paul el  yet Im sure more people in history have being murdered over blasphemy than reading harry potter.
@paul el  alrighty
I was already interested in hogwarts legacy but this tweet makes me want to buy it that much more
love this. thanks for your take. this game looks absolutely incredible. cant wait to play
they want people to boycott the game because rowling said things  but they have no issues with certain actors who did and said inaproppriate things to kids and other people  v
melonie  that part where youread that woke hitpiece against jk rowling burst my brain cells.
honestly was not even giving hogwarts any attention but now I think I ll pick it up!!!
you have my sub just for the title. looks like I agree with everything you say. thanks for doing your own research for the sake of us. keep up the good work.
im actually really excited for this game
hogwarts legacy is the harry potter game we all wanted!
keeping my hype to a minimum but Im honestly looking forward to what they do with the universe.
mam  you got a sub for this one! love the hedwig in the background too. just ordered the wife the  loyal  magic caster wand to go with her deluxe edition of the game to make up for the fact that the collectors edition was kind of booty. and funny  after the deluxe price and the price of the wand... still less expensive than the collectors edition. and I couldn t agree with you more about the state of games. I use game pass and rarely buy games new anymore because of the bugs and almost always drop a good  20 or so in the first month. keep up the good content lady! keep on truckin! p.s. I dont much care for the term wokies... feel like it insults the entirety of the wookie race.
seeing stuff like this makes me want the game to release faster idk why but it keeps hyping me up for this game
wokies  why its not made only for me developers of hogwarts legacy  Imissed the part where thats my problem.
just found your channel. love the tattoos. yes  I am looking forward to hogwart s legacy and pre-ordered it right after the second gameshow preview that was released. this topic is full of cringe. as I listened and read what all of the controversy was about  I shook my head. I didn t know there was so much controversy surrounding harry potter and hogwart s legacy. I get people have issues with thing they either dont like know anything about or because it conflicts with their beliefs  but this is a new one for me. hating a game movie song or artwork just because it depicts the differences between people  opinions or their cultures is the epitome of hate. there is too much hate in the world already.
as soon as I heard it would make them mad I preordered.  Im not a hp fan but I do like open world games.
keep being you meloni. you always got my support
not a hogwarts fan  but I ll buy it just to spite these mofos
I hope there is a final solution for the goblin question in the game
as a big hp fan and a fan of anything that pisses off the wokies  I can say that this is one of my most anticipated games of the year
when you you said  I cant believe we re arguing over goblin rights right now  I just have this image in my head of goblin slayer with his red glowing eye in his helmet arguing  goblins have no rights!
if cho chang had an out-there-lotr-like name  people would complain that there are no asians in the books. then years later jk would say aragornia begonia was actually asian and the other half of people would complain that jk is doing woke retcon again.
are you calling trans lgbt people pedophiles
@space sushi  what xdd
based
we all know what must be done and should not talk about ituntil the goblins are on the wagons  headed to the camps.
if harry potter has a goblin issue  than so does warcraft games. blizzard uses the exact same features for their goblins. yet no one says a thing.
a lot of wb games like the arkham and Lord of the rings series are incredible  so this game is most likely going to be the same. definitely picking it up. the hate is causing a major  streisand  effect. making people buy the game out of spite. lol.
I haven t pre-ordered a game in years for the exact reasons you mentioned  but as soon as Im able to Im pre-ordering this one. Im not letting the looneys tell me how to live.
based on gameplay Ive seen  this was a great purchase regardless of reasoning. it looks about as fun to me as elden ring
got my copy preordered. cant wait to play.
imagine giving someone the spotlight and exposure that changes their lives and then those people throw you under the bud to avoid being hated. if I was an actor and they gave me that opportunity damn well I ll be on thatship if itsinks or floats
never have I had so much fun watching someone struggle to read an artikel great video I was laughing all the way
Im not even a harry potter fan  though I did enjoy the quidditch world cup video game years ago  but I preordered this game just to upset the weirdos on twitter.
I never became a potterhead despite enjoying the movies. I hope you like hogwart s legacy.
I grew up in the 80s and the 90s. I feel like eventually common sense good messages happened in media and popular culture. there would definitely be push back from bigoted  people. but now its harder to really be ground breaking or heroic with media  and still tow the line . so media has to make stories where there are none to sell the product.
as a big harry potter fan when I was younger I have been keeping an eye on most of the potter drama.when I first read that dumbledore was gay  I re-read book 7 and it just gave the story a very big change. the relation between dumbledore and grindelwald became so dark and depressing. it is no longer a story of 2 close friends becoming enemies nemesis. it becomes a story of love  manipulation  broken hearts. you can even see some parts of narcicism and domestic violence in the relationship between grindelwald and dumbledore. rowling has said she knew dumbledore was gay since around 2000  she just didn t share it. first time she did share it was at a table-read of movie 6. it was a line of..  ooh  I remember an evening with a cute mugglegirl.  they needed to remove the line.that hermione is black. that isn t true. according to rowling it is never specified thatshe isn t black. eye color  hair color. hair style. that is specified. therfor it is not wrong to make her black for the cursed child play. it is not the same as saying she is black.but I do think it was wrong to make that change.cho chang. that controversy must be the one I cant really understand. I get the countries mixed up so if I type wrong  I am sorry.the girl is named cho chang.cho is a last name from japan  while chang is a first name from china. I also believe chang is a male name. so the name is just... wrong. its like trump would have last name donald and first name trump. I think it just sound stupid. it is a made up name!!melonie being luna lovegood. hmm. I would had picked ginny instead  but I can see luna in you.
never been a harry potter fan but the maybe 3 films Ive seen I enjoyed very much.  this game sounds really good and if it will strike a blow to the leftists for it to succeed   Im in.
I read that as wookies and thought about chewbacca screaming into the void.  but at the same time  maybe it is essentially the same thing.
Im going to purchase that game. take care melonie
I haven t been a harry potter fan since I was a kid but the controversy actually brought this game to my attention. now I think it looks cool so I pre- ordered it.
I am pretty sure the whole dumbledore being gay thing was not a retcon. it was more so character development that was never brought up in the books until the last book when she reveled the whole relationship between him and grindlewald
Ive also got the deluxe edition preordered. hopefully the perks it comes with are worth it
its true all of these takes make me want to preorder even though I rarely preorder
I read all the books and saw all the movies Im excited for the game
fine by me  absolutely gonna be getting the series x version for sure and when they get it out  the switch version.   assuming the later version is optimized decently that is
just pre-ordered! love your content.  happy new year
even the arkham games were broken on release.
none of those games were made by avalanche studios. the only wb game they made is mad max and that was not a banger.
@th3professor  that was the other avalanche.  this is the one that made branded games for disney. just cause  mad max and rage 2 was def the other company
@th3professor  that mad max game was actually good tho
@th3professor  mad max was tight! Im excited.
@dallonvlogs aslyum and city weren t broken  knight was. stop the lies please  thanks.
@mr mxyzptlk  I said there were glitches. they weren t completely broken.
@dallonvlogs  having glitches isn t broken  what
troy is a very chill guy  I bet if youreach out to him over twitter you could get yourself an interview.he did a interview with colin m. a few months back and it was pretty interesting.
Im definitely getting the hogwarts legacy game.. seen the previews  looks great
preordered this game back in september and im so excited for it!
Ive never read the books  only watched the movies  not even a huge harry potter fan  but the game looks cool and Imost certainly preordered it a few months ago.
I pre-ordered for pc back in august. very much looking forward to playing it.
I pre order nothing  but wait until some early gamplay reviews come out. saying that  my two kids love the books and cant wait for the game to come out. this game seems to have that world to explore in that particular universe. it will take off in initial sales. we will see after its out. im a fan of the wb Lord of the rings 2 shadow games. I had a really good time exploring mordor. if they manage to pull off the same vibe with this universe  Imight enjoy this too. if its done right.
I read the books awhile ago  Imight give this one a shot. it looks pretty interesting.
I cant remember how the entire scenario went  it was like 1st grade  when the franchise was blowing up  never read the books just watched the movies. I did read like 2  I had this best friend and I told him I liked them and he told me I couldn t because it was against God and stuff like that  and basically for a few days he wouldn t talk to me  we ended up talking again  I went to church a few times with him and he s one of the reasons Im constantly thinking about God  Im 30 now  he wished me a happy birthday last december on facebook. we need people like you and him in this world  dont listen the hate melonie. keep being you. its what draws me to your content. you help people.
Im subscribed to  tmartn and hollow and they showed game footage and it actually looks really good. I have seen all the movies. I agree Im with you  melonie
I already wanted to play hogwarts legacy. I just want to play it more now.
I need to buy melonie a harry potter scarf she can wear on her videos just to make the wokies squirm more  Im thinking melonie is a ravenclaw lol
@melonie while I can understand people getting the game to  get back at.  there is still the golden rule of never pre-order a game  especially in current days. I cantell you some things already wrong with it  like exclusive ps5 missions and shops  lack of qudditch and no moral choices for using dark arts spells or unforgivable curses. this isn t even to mention there is w.o.k.e stuff in it like the non-bin options and gnder  stuff.
my daughters used to love the hp stuff.  makes me sad that is no longer the case.
they really make me want to gatekeep everything I love. they have tried to or have ruined most of my favorite hobbies. they dont even play the games or enjoy any of the things they complain about. I wish they d just leave us all alone to enjoy our hobbies.
I walked by game stop 2 days ago...not a mention of hogwarts. today -- the entire door was covered with a hogwarts poster and there was a small flyer of it on the window. when scrolling again  I had to stop and comment on how much this thumbnail makes me smile
I pre-ordered it just for the castle. Im realistically expecting it to be a beautiful 7 10. its not impossible for a studio that only made licensed disney games to pump out a rich open world  see days gone   but Im not expecting 2023 goty.these weirdos can stuff it. I dont take my orders from twitter.
if you ask me  pre-ordering is one of the main reasons games are getting released broken and unfinished so often anymore. they already have your money and you ve committed to buying it regardless of how bad or broken it is.
I have some woke people to spite right now  - legend in the making.
yes  there s an asian named cho chang in a world with names like severus snape and luna lovegood. but then there s kids named oliver wood and ernie macmillan  so its not like normal names are out of place in the books.  sounds kinda like the real world where most of us have normal everyday names and some of us have more exotic ones  doesnt it
just stumbled across your channel. I will always subscribe and support base content creators  thank you for your honesty. you have my support!
do they offer anything if you preorder  if not then I ll just wait until the game comes out
now thats a conversation that can go on for a long time. your logic is solid and Im sure that happens in some cases but I have a hard time believing that if people stopped pre-ordering things would get better. Imean  just look at the latest pokemon games  10 million copies in 72 hours  even after everyone said it was broken. maybe Im just a cynic but I think people will buy shit based on hype even after release. I would say that the real problem is games today are huge projects that need more development time than investors are willing to allow. something has to be done about that  5  years is too long  and still somehow not enough.
its usually the woke crowd that forces me when I see or hear a game that I am familiar with that gets me to buy the product they are screaming about. spite has been a great motivator in getting me to buy the games I slack on doing until the last few days xd
they re not going to stop this game  but they may stop the next one.  from the videos Ive seen  the dev team seem to lean in that direction  just based on how they talk  and the choice of guest player to appear on their video.   and I doubt they were expecing this kind of backlash  although from a small amount of insaniacs. so it would not surprise me if they are influenced to puill back on future plans for the franchise.  just a gut feeling.
I love it. I hope this just sells out everywhere just to spite them if nothing else. real talk though  I hope its actually a good game. we honestly need more of those and more actual good hp additions would be nice.
Im not much of a harry potter fan myself  I only really read the first three books in middle school back in the early 2000s.  I remember a lot of the controversy at the time  thats what made my dad be against it  I dont think thats why I ignored the franchise but it may have contributed.  if I ever did get into it I d probably ignore the movies considering how hateful their actors have been to the very creator of the mythology  thats definitely not cool.as far as the woke mob goes  I think my response to a friend of mine several months ago sums up my opinion   I wish they d just go back to bed !!!
Im not a hp fan  Ive never seen the movies  aside from a few minutes here or there  but the game looks pretty sweet and I ll be grabbing a copy if the scores aren t abysmal.
I always believed all the races in aont are ficitonal..... since they are. even the landmass though is our world pretty much just turned upside down is very different from ours. but if there was any equivalents to real world races I always thought of the eldians being german  hizuru being japanese  marley being english or some other uk country  and the jewish people being like the ackermans or something like that. mainly cause one of them is named levI  although I know that name was picked just cause isayama liked Jesus camp  which is odd but interesting
I cant wait for hogwarts legacy on my pc I hope its a game of the year contender or even a nominee
I agree these games are usually broken on release overly much. very prudent to use the exact words of the people criticising the product rather than interpret them and then be accused of distorting the facts -- as they are apt to do!
already preordered mine the game looks amazing and these people are insane.
I have 2 pre-orders and im very happy and exited for this game
wasn t going to get the game but definitely considering it now. Imight not even play it but I love the harry potter movies  books and spitting the woke community and supporting companies willing to stand against them is reason enough to get it. I hope its a great game. love jkr.  emmawatsonishermionegranger  onlywomenmenstruate
I will be buying it 100  shame its not on pc yet. not much of a fan of the movies but the game looks like its got some good action
I was thinking about buying this game second hand. but after seeing people tweet  f you if you buy this game  or  youre a piece of s  t if you buy this game   it just made me want it even more. so I preordered the deluxe edition  and after seeing some more gameplay  Im so glad I did.
im the same way I think harry movie is alright im not too crazy about it but the game looks very interesting so Imight buy it but I dont see a reason to preorder it this early or to preorder at all unless they re offer something to preorder if not then I ll just wait until the game comes out
Im going to buy the game just in support of jk rowling. I intended to play it either way  but now Im probably going to pre order it.
the situation with troy leavtiz was actually fairly simple. he told avalanche about his youtube channel when he was hired and they didn t have a problem with it or his opinions. people who desperately want this game to fail found out he was part of the team and started harassing him and were trying to get him fired. avalanche stood with him but it got to a point that it was affecting his family. troy said in an interview with the youtber podcast now  that he was planning on retiring anyway  the harassment just sped up his decision due to family and health issues and he wanted less things to worry about. he is officially retired from the industry but he said in that interview that he still maintains contact and is still friendly with the people making the game.edit  oh  it looks like troy left a comment on this video explaining the situation better than I did and is now a pinned comment.
the sad thing is that rowley courted the woke mob until they turned on her  and this game looks woke as hell. there wasn t one demo I saw where you weren t playing an asian or black wizard . lets not forget rowley with her  hermione was always black  and  dumbledore was always gay  statements as she had to crowbar those elements in due to her wokeness! I say let them eat each other!
I dont usually preorder  because its just a really bad idea. but  I was already interested in this game anyway  so deluxe edition preordered!
I ll buy my hogwarts legacy as soon as it releases!! seems like a great game and woke mob will be angry as a bonus lol
this was hilarious reactions  the  make it make sense  is so funny every time.
do they offer anything if you preorder
@red scorpion  a free onyx hippogriff mount  you can get a look at it in their second showcase. it looks awesome!
its a 100  buy for me now
my mom freaks out if I say harry potter spells out loud. she thinks its going to summon something evil
watched nearly all the harry potters over Christmas break  had to skip philosophers stone  best to say they were finding their feet in that one . much better than I remember. prisoner of azkaban is possibly the best one
have to say from the gameplay videos I have seen this game look great  I dont game much these days but I think this is worth a punt.
the majority of those celebrities saying this  against rowling  stuff are saying it because they have no choice. they still have a lot of years of work in the terribly-woke hollywood industry and if they want to keep working  they ll toe the line. rowling has made her millions  or billions  and is far enough along  and mature enough  to speak  truth to power .
I realized I have free shipping on amazon  so I preordered the deluxe edition just now of hogwarts legacy as well as the megaman battle network legacy collection.
people are being so outwardly racist these days while thinking they re trying to combat it and be more inclusive  its insane. I was listening to a star wars  clone wars podcast and the reason I stopped listening to it was because they literally kept saying every character - mostly if they villains or morally grey - who had an accent other than american or british was a racist stereotype. Im not even sure they knew they were doing it. they literally said hondo ohnaka was a racist stereotype because they couldn t quite tell what kind of accent the actor was trying to do but itsounded vaguely eastern and the character is a pirate and they tried to link it to terrorism. like  all I could think was if you hear a foreign accent and immediately start trying to find reasons that it might be racist then you are literally the one who is racially stereotyping. if youre doing that  you are part of the problem. its like when the dune trailer dropped and people legit asked why there were no arabs in it. that is literally racist. I also cant help but think that all the white people who shout  white savior  whenever a movie about native people comes out are subconsciously being the white saviors they hate so much just by saying that.
if they actually mean they hate me for playing hogwarts legacy  I consider that a badge of honor
Im not even a huge potter fan. but  will absolutely be pre-ordering. vote with your dollars.
I had zero interest in hogwarts legacy but being told  f you if you buy this  makes my credit card hand get itchy.
8 30 this came up while talking with a friend yesterday. the worst ones are the sellout cowards who only say what the minions wants to hear out of self preservation and greed.
5 seconds of silence for goblins  issues
hogwarts legacy!
this brand of outage is a good indicator of quality lately  I go looking for it. they dont understand that they are the same kind of people who invented the parental advisory stickers
I want to buy the game even more now
I haven t pre ordered a game since the early 2000 s.  maybe I will pre order this just to keep the tears flowing.
I checked this game on steam. tons of positive curator reviews. only 3 mentioned this issue with jk rowling
when I was young I used to play the 5th movie game on the wiI constantly because it was open world and eventually learned my way around the castle.
hey melonie! looking lovely today. hope youre doing well
I have been a hp fan since I read the first book tbh Im definitely getting this
hI    this is my first video Ive saw from you   and I have to say you are very likable    Ive preordered the game and Im hyped for it   I am sure it will be great   perhaps I ll get the ps4 version too just to see these wokies melt a little bit more xd
this  saira  character should realize that all she s done is draw more attention to the game  and is inadvertently driving up sales!nice job   saira ! enjoy getting ratioed on twitter  while youre at it!
I just subscribed to your channel and I do like what you talk about and youre absolutely right it is crazy how everybody is going crazy over hogwarts legacy I ll just because of what happened Imean come on
on the weird name thing in the harry potter books wizards are portrayed as a culture so insular that they have no idea what goes on in the muggle world. of course they d have weird names and naming standard. itshows how isolated from muggle culture they are.if a wizard has a normal sounding name by our standards  or in the case of cho chang  a foreign sounding name   odds are that they re either muggleborn or have a muggleborn parent.of course  this isn t a hard and fast rule. the biggest and well known counter example is hermione granger  a muggleborn.
I have never seen nor read any harry potter. I just dont care for it as a genre. but you are right thatsome of the stuff going on is a direct attack against women.
bought the deluxe version on steam today  d gonna play it every single day for months even years.
at this point  its literally a better idea to just go out of your way to tick the wokies off.
sounds like a game worth pre-ordering
not a harry potter fan it was more for my nieces age range when it hit theatres  so just never got into it at that time it was lotr or harry potter   I was lotr all the way.but the game footage Ive been seeing makes me wanna try this game out.pre-order may be a good bet when a game has good footage leading up to release thatsucker might be hard to get a day 1 copy for.
I talked about the hogwarts game for 5 secs on twitch and I was instently attacked holy crap  side note I forgot who even jk rowling is till today
there was just a dude who  identified as a girl  and put on a dress to hang out in the girls bathroom or locker room and he it tried to talk to a girl who didn t want anything to do with him so he it beat her up.  lmao.   where are these wackos to denounce that   they want to tell us what to play or dont play  or watch and dont watch  better start checking themselves before there s problems outside of just internet name calling for reals.
its interesting someone in the tweets you showed said that it was streisand effect marketing. if it really is thats kinda dirty to sell games on outrage. I hope they get outted and burned for it if it ever comes to be true.
I ll definitely be preordering hogwarts legacy deluxe edition for my series s next month next will be jedI survivor dead island 2 resident evil 4 remake and diablo 4 my pre order list might change depending on when starfield releases
yeah  its such a stupid take to me. I honestly didn t know much about it  now its just a shorter wait for me. Im looking forward to it
I dont reverse   mutual follow people.  I follow people for my interest.I would like to point out that taking people s tweets out of context or purposely misinterpreting people s tweets can be a lot of fun.I saw lots of comments where guys would respond something like  ok! I bought my copy. where can we meet up ! Im in favor of misinterpretation just for the frustration factor. I haven t mastered it  people ultimately know that Im poking at them  but at least Im having fun.
I did a few harry potter quizzes after watching this video  out of 4 quizzes  I got 2 as snape  and 2 as voldamort.
this year s going to suck for movies and tv   but games are looking pretty good. -dead space-hogwarts legacy-resident evil 4-loz tears of the kingdom-spider-man 2-final fantasy xvi-starfield-final fantasy viI rebirthand thats just the stuff that I can remember.
I think the company  suggested troy should go for early retirement with a good severance package.  anyway  I have never pre-ordered a game  but I will for this  even if I dont like the final release.
you d think a group of people who are so out of touch with reality would be excited when a game like this comes out
Im ordering extra copies too out of spite.
good work melonie  Imay buy the game also  and I dont even own a console that will play it!
the funny thing is you get to choose if youre a witch or wizard lol
I ll wait for reviews  just like always. it looks cool  but I trust nobody anymore lmao part of me thinks they do this kinda crap on purpose just to get people to buy it to spite the other side of the political aisle.
just imagine waking up everyday and deciding to be miserable over someone else s opinions  beliefs and what they like.
like we actors and artists say  the art should not be compared to the artist. we are all allowed to have different opinions  but not if they are truly hurtfull and actually attack others. I love the harry potter world  and yet I dont stand with jks opinions... its a company just using the art  not jk herself coming out with the game.
while I hear what old fans are saying about tomb raider  I really enjoyed the last few games  especially 1 3 of the reboot  and want to see more of that lara I spent so many hours with.  I would not mind seeing her become more proactive  and finally get her dual-gun style back  but I like that they ve spent time developing her character arc through this trilogy and like to imagine they are building toward a more fleshed-out version of the original.  there are parts of the last game where she went full-rambo on people - there s no question she s a badass - and I had fun with the tombs so I had no problems there  either. maybe we can get a modern remake of one of the old games  to make the original fans happy  and a continuation of the latest trilogy  to feed the new fans as well.  I hate to see old fans left out in the rain but I dont want to see them stop making the games I like  either.
when hardcore fans and nerds were gate keeping  no wokeness detected. when casuals and normies were allowed in  wokeness everywhere. community s apartment on fire when returning with pizza meme sold separately
Im probably going to buy it just because of her tweet  then never take it out of the package.
I just added hogwarts legacy to my steam wishlist.
not gonna preorder it  because right now my pc cant handle  it  at least from what I saw in the requirements  but  Im definitely going  to buy and enjoy it eventually. wokesters can go to hell for my part  because  this  game  has  everything  I want from an rpg and  its  st in one  of  my favorite franchises. if any of them want  to challenge me on that  bring  it  on I say.
most games movies shows try to have more than one thing going on. so you see what you are looking for often.  d nothing is great or bad as you think.
I read this as  wookies rage  I honestly like that title better lol
I watched all the movies on hbo max  but I never wouldn t consider myself much invested in the hp fandom.
not my kind of game. I wouldn t take the advice of anyone on twitter to inform my purchasing choices though either. the best thing I ever did was delete all social media. its no better than drunk people yelling at each other across the bar. with any of these debates  I stay out of it because there s absolutely no way you can win. facts wont matter  logic wont matter  life experience wont matter. everyone now goes out of their way to find offense and be upset about anything and everything.
Imight buy a bunch of extra copies to give away in like a channel giveaway or something. kind of want to support it more than just one purchase.
imma upgrade to the deluxe edition now lmao cant wait for this game.
Im getting the digital deluxe edition
for the moment I thought the title was  wookies reee over hogwards legacy preorders  and was like ... star war hates hogwarts
hopefully hogwarts legacy releases and runs perfectly.  its getting cyberpunk hype.
my fav time of the day...... mel out here making fun of these clowns.....never fails
never been a fan of harry potter my dyslexia made reading a nightmare . but I have friends who are excited and maybe after there opinion Imight pick it up since I love rpg so maybe it could be fun
@meloniemac did you hear that magfest had an anti-kotaku sign and when a kotaku fash journo tweeted about it  they immediately bent and apologized
I think you can easily get your roI once you start to feature hogwarts legacy.
so basically jk did her own version of pyscho. lol
I went ahead and pre-ordered the deluxe edition today. heck  Imay even play it.
this just makes me want to get this game even more. I love harry potter and knowing that this makes the woke weirdo s mad Im all for it.
pre-ordered back in november. hate me all you want!
Imust say  I laughed too hard at some of those statements. goblins being similar to jews is not something I ever saw  but that they admit that they do is too hilarious to me but to tell it from my perspective  I am a trans woman. I grew up in a small town and was bullied relentlessly. while you might not have read the books or seen the movies  I did and it was my escape. I loved it! then  years later  the author of my favourite series of all time suddenly begins berating my lifestyle and saying I as a person is invalid..it hurt  as her entire ip got me through a lot of my childhood  and now she stands against much of what I am. full circle..still though  I will absolutely play the game! I love the series  and the people working on it are equally as passionate as I am to this day. it is sad when your hero utterly destroys who you are as a person  and for that  she has lost my respect  but still  her ip is dear to my heart. its a complicated feeling  but the legacy she created lives on  and for that I am happy for both her and the developers! the game looks fricking amazing!!
Im gonna pre order twice
I was going to wait for reviews before buying it. then realized we wont be able to rely on reviewers to treat this game fairly. even if they absolutely love it . are these hive-mind clowns going to risk being the only one to give it a 9 or 10 10  just pre-ordered my copy and I ll have to decide on my own if its good or not.
hey mel  remember to not just drink water but keep your electrolytes topped up too.
lmao me with 3 harry potter wands  the full movie set  the hard cover book trunk set and the legacy edition of hogwarts legacy    twanswopebec
enjoyed the video.  disappointed in radcliffe and grint dissing rowling  watson jumped in head-first at her earliest opportunity  no surprise there really .  guess I ll have to put them on my hollywood sh tlist.  not that it ll make much difference  but it assuages my conscience if nothing else.
I pre ordered the deluxe edition so I guess Im a bad person too.
yes the wizarding world is full of unusual names  like harry  ron  dean  tom  james  lily  charlie  fred  george  etc...
I cant wait for hogwarts legacy
I did that personality test and also got luna  we should date.
cho chang - normal nameharry potter - mystical nameron weasel - regal nametom riddle - subverts convention
honestly  I have not consumed any harry p materials since the second movie and I read the first 4 books when I was younger. I will be pre-ordering this game on xbox and on my switch for portable play.
my wife and I both preordered hwl. we re both huge hp fans  and she wanted hwl  so I preordered it for her for Christmas.  for myself  I honestly had no plans to get the game  buy when I saw that the woketards were going full reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  I immediately whipped out my credit card and got a copy as well  just to piss their pathetic asses off.
hI  cis guy here  and I like harry potter too. I have nothing against trans people  but I was just wondering...you know melonie is Christian and holds very similiar opinions to rowling s  if so  what brings you to this channel  what do you like about melonie  because  you know  for me is quite simple to spot all the pandering  virtue signaling  and whatnot  so melonie is usually funny to listen to. but from time to time I wonder if I d think differently about all this stuff  if I wasn t  you know  a common cis etero guy  well I dont actually feel Im that common  but for brevity sake . sorry if my english is not perfect  its not my first lenguage.
@.begbat. hey! hmm..I just stumbled upon the video on my feed as I find it funny how many people   wokies  as many call them  want to cancel stuff for the most ridiculous of reasons  and she popped up. huh  I didn t know thatshe had the same views as rowling  maybe I am not the right target audience..haha!   but I just wanted to share my opinion and perspective on the whole scenario. because like you say  its absolutely hilarious to hear all the bullsh t reasons people of cancel culture want to cancel something. I think people are too sensitive nowadays and get offended by everything just because they can  so I just wanted to share  the other side  of the story as a trans person. maybe also to let people know that not all trans people are as f cked up as those who make the most noise. some are actually reasonable! but that is usually the case most of the time..
@alicia a  thank you for the answer. it was already clear to me that not always the target group of some ideologies  like you are  for example  to far left ideologists  shares necessary the same values  or approaches politics in the same way as these extremists. as humans  we re way more complex than what labes and stereotipes make of us. its just that I never spoke with a trans  so I was curious to hear your opinion. regarding the rowling situation  my understanding is that it was a bit exaggerated. journals and websites tend to ignore thatshe said  probably multiple times  thatshe holds no personal grudge against trans people. it just happens thatshe is a radical feminist  and natural sex  you know  the whole chromosome thing  is important for these kind of feminists.  difference feminism   as they also call it  exists since the eighties  and before being labeled as  transphobic   it was always pretty much misandrist  I d argue  in fact  that radical feminists  in general  just cant stand no man  not even if he choose to be a woman . it is what it is  I grew up with her books and movies  and I respect her for this reason alone. I really dont care about her stupid politics. yes  lots of people are oversensitive today. but there is also a precise will to put people one against the other. this is how politics works  after all.
@.begbat.  hehe  I see what you mean. just for the record  I am not a far leftist..the leftist left me. but I also think that is a very americanthing  not to be rude   and since I am neither american nor interested in deep politics  I am just an outsider with my own opinions. its good to share different opinions and views without it becoming aggressive! I find such conversations interesting. and youre probably right  it was probably a bit exaggerated  but there is still a lot of truth about what she said about her opinions. but hey  we re all allowed to have different opinions  its just some things that are better kept within close circles. I am not very vocal on social media  as I am probably right in the middle of these political groups  and even I am scared of cancel culture..! I have a..specific type of humour shall we say..and I agree  radical feminism has taken a wrong turn somewhere  its not about equality anymore. but the thing is  trans women dont  destroy womanhood  or what it means to be a woman  nor do we expect to take their places in society..we just exist as women. I rarely hear the same arguments for trans men  and I find that interesting..but as you say  politics is too much for me as well  it can get so heated and ridiculous that I just cant! haha! but still..reading certain opinions can still hurt. but I wouldn t attack her for her personal views. I see no need for it. it is sometimes funny to watch though  not gonna lie..but to this day I still rewatch the movies yearly if I can  and I am so looking forward to the game!! I am obviously passionate about her ip still  and I think I will forever be grateful for her work.
@.begbat.  that is one of the most reasonable statements Ive heard about the topic  no matter if youre a straight biological male. its true! I think maybe some of the louder women are so scared to lose their definition of womanhood that they put themselves above everything and everyone and are ruining themselves in the process. by louder I obviously those who preach the most  not the majority who are just living their lives.when it comes to the controversial topics  I find them silly...when it comes to the public bathroom situation  I avoid them like the plague. I dont even go to public pools. I think many are in the same mindset. its too vulnerable. and I find itstupid. Im not gonna deny that there are creeps out there that would take advantage  but 99.9  just do their business and move on. unnoticed. the creeps will find a way to keep creeping someway. when it comes to sports  I dont personally care...but I find it interesting that no one is talking about how trans men allegedly would be weaker. but I dont know enough about the topic to give an opinion about it. underage hormonal treatment however  that I disagree with. sure  I found out about my situation when I was 7  but I am a 90 s kid  so old that that was before the internet was in every household so I didn t have that knowledge at the tip of my fingers  anyways  I started my journey at 13 as I got more knowledge. but I dont see the problem with children dressing up or drag queen storytelling  drag queens are hilarious! but to transition before you know for certain is dumb. exploring  however  is a different thing. I think sometimes people misunderstand the difference nowadays  as so many are scared their child is transitioning  when in fact there has become a multitude of options for them to just explore and play with. that is my two cents at least. I think misunderstanding and confusion are a common threads as 5 or 10 years ago all of these options were unheard of  and some parents are stuck in the past  while others are too eager and proud of their acceptance. I dont see the wrong in being accepting  absolutely not  but forcing their child to dress up is unacceptable. but so is denying them their freedom to explore themselves. that is a very straightforward  yet complicated issue I dont find the question offensive  no. it takes a lot more to provoke me  I watched drawn together as a child and it is my favourite adult cartoon to this day!  like you probably wouldn t find  how would you define a man   would be offensive. I honestly think everyone would have different answers with slight similarities  dont you think  it is a very difficult answer to give I think. I dont know. I am caring  and supportive  I like being the person people can vent to when they have problems. I am an emotional creature  not in a sad way but in a reflective way. but I think that would be feminine attributes  I am also a huge nerd and gamer  and I studied game design  but for a long ass time that was seen as a very masculine thing. the more I think about it  and I am thinking so hard right now!   I can only think of qualities and attributes that are more feminine than masculine and vice versa...but we all have a bit of each in us  dont you think  that is such a hard question. people would probably debate whether giving birth is what makes you a woman  but many women cant have children  and that doesnt make them less of a woman...how would you define a man  I am genuinely curious! very interesting indeed! this is a fun thought experiment!
@alicia a  a game designer! cool...did you make any games     thank you for the answer  by the way. I really dont know much about those topics  so I ll say nothing. my definition of man  well...wouldn t be much different than that of woman  and not so different than what you can find on the dictionary  well  at least  the cambridge dictionary. Im italian  but our dictionaries are less complete  in a sense . there is the common biological definition  that usually identify man through his genitalia  or at least  in the cultures I know about  as a synonimous of adult male. of course  the medical scientific definition would be the same  but they would consider the different cellular biology  not the genitalia  also as the reason to treat sexes differently  and more efficiently  or so they told me  with different drugs  and such. and then  there is the cultural definition  and the  partially  arbitrary attribution of  virility qualities  to the phallus  which of course can be sometimes problematic. I say partially  because obviously  only the phallus can impregnate. but the semantic field of this material object - which in the end became also abstract  and symbolic of many different  ideal  attribuites  qualities  physiognomic traits  and so on - can be often coercive  if you dont live up to it  many cis men  for different reasons  or you didn t even ask to have it in the first place  trans women  i.e. . so  in short  I d personally say this  a man is an adult male  and also  someone who identifies and live as male  for different and personal reasons  as you suggest me  even if he lacks  materially  the phallus. the same goes for women but in the opposite way. conceptually to me is very simple  even if it looks contradictory. who cares  its society that makes it complex. so  are you working on some game project  Im kind of curious...also because I like to make  game  music  or at least I try  so...yeah I like videogames. let me know  if you want
I needed to hear wokies go reeee! today. the news makes the news I got earlier hit less as hard as it is.my grandmother may not have a lot of time left and even if I am not really showing it to my family  I am really taking it hard. I know some are going to try to kick me while I am down  but that may be my pessimism talking.also when I see jewish people  the last thing I think about are  goblin slayer abridged-esque  filthy gaaaaaawblinsssss!!!!!!!
I was not going to buy on release  but the more of these people I see  the more I want to preorder.
Im buying the game but only because of these insane people. buy the game to show your support for jkr.
I bought my copies out of sheer spite as I know nothing of potter. jkr has been fantastic in fighting the loonery here in scotland. I never thought I d be defending feminists but  in this case  its needed. love ya mm
ill wait till the game comes out and a few reviews are dropped  im just not convinced enough that its worth a pre oreder so ill wait and see and maybe ill pick it up.
the world we re living   at the moment   in is beyond a parody.
at this point  I just write checks directly to jk rowling.
everything jk said are facts lol
now we need justice for goblin
I was debating buying the regular to the deluxe version  but these weirdos made me buy the deluxe version out of spite.
ha ha ha!  seeing this thumbnail and title  I know its going to be a good video. got my dinner ready to eat and here we go -- get mac d!
I got the digital deluxe months ago.no regrets.
now Im gonna buy it even harder
now I feel like I have to pre-order it....
the potter cast would not even be popular were it not for j.k. rowling  the least they could have done would be to reserve their statements  respect to the one who basically put them on the map.
I just hope this game works on the steam deck  if it does imma buy it
I had already got the digital deluxe  time to buy another copy for my girl
Im too cheap to pay full price for it. aiming for the steam summer sale when nobody is playing it anymore.
I couldn t care less about harry potter  but all this reeeeing definitely makes me want to buy the game. I swear  this better not be some clever marketing trick to sell more copies.
I cant wait to get my game
Ive been at work 12 hours a day last couple days and not clued in  looking forward to what you say
thank you so much  I hope you enjoy
never trust a man in a dress  is great advice.  he s already lying before he open his mouth.
I pre ordered the deluxe edition. I know Im going to enjoy it  but if it makes the woke mad  then thats even better. lol
Im gonna wear my slytherin hoodie when I go pick up my deluxe edition.
thanks for the reminder to pre-order the deluxe edition
thank you for this   Im subbing to you to your channel to binge your videos and spam the like button
now that this situation is progressing as it is  this is turning into that meme of melonie as the emperor palpatine stating  unlimited power!  ha ha ha
given the current state of the gaming industry  I no longer pre-order anything anymore. got burned too many times. with thatsaid  I am keeping an eye on this game  and if independent reviews are good  I will most likely get it. never read the books  saw the movies only once  but I do like to stick it to cancer.. ehh  cancel culture..
Imight mess around and buy two
on the kids discussion it does get scary when people wanna put kids on puberty blockers  when those are the same drugs used to castrate pedos I think there are maybe some situation like blair white where she had gender dysphoria so bad she knew at 5 she was trans  but every case is different and doctors and medical professionals should only look to help someone transition as a last resort
never trust a man in a dress  boy is that the truth.
the people of harry potter should thank them for giving them the barbra streisand effect.
I d love to try the game  but I cant afford neither the game  nor the graphicscard required to run it.
ordering my deluxe edition right now for the lols
Im really afraid that with all the woke backlash they had  they are going to make this game the wokest possible.
I read that as  wookies  and wondered why they cared.
the hogwarts salt is beyond amazing!!
this game looks great preorderd last week
imagine what s gonna happen with they find out about the goblin slayer anime
I cant wait to play hogwarts legacy. all the drama is embarrassing.  its still going to sell well.
also remember the devs of this game fired a game dev because he used to make youtube videos going against the woke crap in games and other stuff years before he was even working.
you d think that after the bayonetta 3 backfire  these twitter weirdos would learn that these things rarely work out in their favor. I had no intention of buying this game and forgot all about it until the recent drama. there s nothing I hate more than seeing game developers being unfairly mistreated and their product misrepresented. the game looks amazing and despite probable technical issues  Im extremely impressed and optimistic.
I want to play hogwarts legacy.  youre a bigot!  uh  Im just some guy who like rpg s.
woke people mad again  cue scene of banner from avengers.  thats my secret  Im always woke!   hulk rage
man. I didn t want to pre order this. then they give me no choice. pretty great marketing strategy actually.
hopefully you ve been able to take care of thatstalker problem you ve been having.
I preordered mine from steam. cant wait until february.
its funny Ive never been a huge harry potter fan this game looked really cool tho thanks to these weirdos I went from getting it eventually mabe on a sale to now ill probably buy the deluxe edition and mabe another version for my nephew thanks weirdos
already preordered and have a countdown on my phone
funniest woke-  !  yet. not bad to start the new year with some laughter.
anger leads to suffering.
not to mention avalanche proudly shouted off the rooftops multiple times that they didn t have jk involved in the creative process  which is something that is making me reconsider getting the game. they re fine to make money off her work but throw her under the bus to appease some internet trolls ....pre-orders only made sense in the era of physical copies  to guarantee you had your hands on a copy on release date.same thing goes for hogwarts legacy  avalanche isn t exactly known for absolute quality-on-release hits. I ll be waiting for a few weeks before picking this up  if at all. probably a second-hand pickup for me so avalanche doesnt get the dosh.
im not pre-ordering because it might be broken. but I am buying it and letting itsit for awhile before I play it lol
I already pre-order it just because I think it might be a fun game lol.
not planning on a preorder but will definitely grab this on sale... regardless of this my answer is the same as it is to anyone who opens the fu can....... but its not very comment section safe  and is nothing more than a series of questions to confirm intent because I just dont care about people who fling that phrase around lol
I need to preorder that game.
honestly people actually look for things to complain about just because they hate jk rowling. they ll stretch all day and night long for it.its funny and sad all at once.and yes. the fnaf guy is scott cawthon
I actually was gonna wait for reviews on the game from people whose opinions I trust  like you  acg  nick930  and digitalfoundry. but then I saw the wokies crying ab how much they ll hate me if I buy the game and decided to preorder.
they are never happy no matter how many times these companies pander to them. you d think these studios would learn by now  lol
I love the characters of harry bo ohw o wo er  hormone  and ed sheeren
I wasn t going to buy hogwarts legacy  I think I will now.
these characters also live in the same world as a guy named ron and his sister named jeannie. such unique and mystical names I am the great and powerful wizard... ron.
I dont even play games  but Im going to buy it and donate it.
I pre-ordered mine just because Ive got money to give jk and I want to have it
f ck you if you buy hogwarts legacy!  he says that like I hold his opinion with any regard. if I had emotions Imight be hurt  probably not  but Imight.
I tweeted at her thanks for the reminder to preorder the game and was blocked within two minutes  was itsomething I said  haha
Im not a harry potter fan and Ive pre-ordered because it looks fun.
you playing the game  will piss them off  oh hell yeah I am subscribing to this channel.
Ive got my pre-order in!
why is the world so full off sheeples and not free thinkers   I love how the cast bite the hand that gave them their current lives fed them.
Im just sad I need to wait until july for it to come out on the switch.
you seem like you d be really useful at grabbing things that were dropped in small spaces
if you got luna lovegood  I love you  nothing else to say  thats the best character in all harry potter books xd
yup  supporting the hell out of this game.
the whole hermione thing is different  she never said she was black  she just said that given her description in the books there was no problem casting a black actress since she never explicitly said she was white and her traits could match those of a black woman.
that tweet makes me wish I could by more than one copy.
I just discovered about how yt is setup and how your channel can get more views. I ll start by watching all your vids all the way through lol
Im not very interested in the game  but Imay just have to order and play itsomeday.
I can definitely see a bit of luna love good  in you!! lol  and Imean that as a compliment of course
Im glad I had the game pre-ordered.
marinettes name from ladybug the children animation series  is also marinette dupen cheng which is the most french chinese name ive seen so far. and it means something like  baking bread  as far as I can remember and shes a young daughter of a chinese and french baker  making macarons here and there.. where is the outcry here lol.. its not just super flat and uncreative  its also  racist stereotyping   in their words. xd but ladybug as a series has some woke traits so thats not a problem. but if rowling is speaking up against the erasure of woman  hogwards is doomed
alas  I am at the point where I hardly get a game at launch. the next game that has such attention from me is currently final fantasy xvi.but hogwarts legacy  let them stick the landing and make a good game  and you ll get a sale out of me then. I preordered the deluxe edition  so...here s hoping.
stopped reading after book 6. I dont remember why exactly  maybe an accumulation of little annoyances that piled up.  Im pretty sure the on-the-nose  ambition is evil  message was a big part of it  the point is I was 17 and I did not like the direction the writing on the wall seemed to indicate it was headed. I kept up with spoilers though and felt more or less vindicated in my choices. thatsaid  the franchise as a whole remained in my good graces that the silly retconning while annoying was easily tuned out.   lately  when I noticed the vitriol and outrage she faced from these lunatics my childhood fondness and nostalgia were tickled and I preordered hogwarts legacy. it looks fun  and I simply cant bring myself to care if j.k rowling s respect for first-grade biology hurts people s feelings. its well past ridiculous. on the cho chang idiocy  yes the name is awkward but she is from a culture of magic. weird names  by our sensibilities are par the course.  that plus I was enough of a  weeb  my brain filed it away by assuming  she had one japanese parent and the other was chinese.
alot of these type of videos make me happy I dont have a girl.   your videos make me happy  but sad I dont have a girl.  this is a great couple.
Im gonna love this game like Ive commented so many times Ive preordered this game as so I they made it possible to do so lmaooo
bruh if I was a kid and I watched every single harry potter movie I ll legit be like y all adults need to grow up!  I wanna be a wizard like now!!
I grew up in a catholic home  and my parents read hp to me as a kid.
despite what people might say about millenials  I am pretty sure it is most of us pre-ordering it... and despite what some zoomers might think  I did read a lot more books prior to harry potter xdso  good job millenials! make the wookes reee xd
always happy to piss them off
is it wrong that it gives me life to see them cry  am I voldemort now   f it. I embrace it.
I wasn t really interested but now I think I ll buy it.
that tweet was so uncalled for  it was actually funny
preordered once for ps5  once for my steam deck.
need to check the gameplay   demo whether my pc can support it or not before buying man those pc requirements are humongous..
funniest part is that the devs are on the same political work side as the boycotters
I ll buy it.  - goblin slayer  probably
pls watch the harry potter movies  its so much fun and charming. also I do plan on buying hogwarts legacy but Im buying it to piss off those woke twitter accounts
Im wondering what will happen when someone streams this game on twitch.
Im pre-odering now just to spite them lol
great content  stay hydrated!
yeah Im that much closer to buying it myself
jk rowling created this money making machine  so she has proven herself to be more intelligent than the no name people fighting her. the game looks awesome.
the only thing that has my attention is ive heard it ll be an open world rpg. and rpgs are my jam!
I pre-ordered the game  which I rarely do  but those f  ktards make me want to buy two copies of it.
a lot of this outrage from people is actually going to work in the game s favor youre right. any press is good press. think about that again when you see the 1000000 million videos saying how bad a certain thing is  show  movie  comic  game  etc . I wonder why they keep making these woke nightmare shows    hmmmm
I read  wookies reee  hahahaha.
as if these weridos can stop a beloved franchise from being popular. most people back in the 2000s grew up with this series and they think their childhood nostalgia is just gonna go away.
all of their hate and anger is what made me get the game in  the first place. all I need is a cup of their tears to drink when the game drops.
... seem to be saying  never trust a man on a dress .  ach  I see you have some experience with us scots.
I wasn t interested in the game  but Imay buy it now lol
same  I was always the Lord of the rings guy. never harry potter. it was to far off and to much urban fantasy for me tho xd.
I actually have no problem with her making dumbledor gay  it makes sense in the story  he was never in a relationship in the original series and it gives us the entire plot to the 3 new movies. without that they d have to just say he and grindlewald were just friends  and thats not really a strong enough bond to form the blood pact.
this makes me want to buy the game just to spite those slinging manufactured outrage.
yay  I just bought the deluxe version of the game
goblin slayer   the final solution to the goblin problem  oh  Jesus  wokies! thanks! I never laughed that hard in a awhile.my gut hurts!
Im not pre-ordering the game cause I dont like pre-ordering anything  but I will get the game without a doubt Im playing this game
I will preorder one and send a picture of the game to the person with a smiley face
thinking of checking this game out..the more people rage about something the more interested I get at least.
Im getting it. watch me wokester watch me.
wait... hold up this was all because rolling had a opinion they did not like right  on a side note do they not realize that aot is about the cycle of violence and how letting go of the past is the only way to stop the cycle of violence
I pre order already  I hope this game break records lol
the  games are for everybody  crowd sure want games for everybody lol.
with the whole  dumbledore is gay -thingI wouldn t really call it a retcon  since she said thatshortly after the release of the 7th book  when people asked about any relationships dumbledore had  with women she than said he was gay  and he was actually in love with grendelwaldplus  it doesnt really retcon anything from the books  afaik...was it woke-pandering maybedid she came up with it only after she finished the booksI highly doubt thatmaybe dumbledore wasn t gay at the beginning and came up with it as she was writing the books  but definitly not after the books were finishedhermione being black on the other hand...
Imean I kinda want to buy it now
annie is bae and hogwarts legacy is gonna be awesome.
woke on woke slapfights is reddited but its also hilarious
if bayonetta 3 boycott taught me 1 thing its that twitter does not represent real world. also shout-out to helena taylor for the greatest marketing move of 2022. not even nintendo could ve marketed that game any better.
Im just mad that they didn t cast actual goblins as goblins. maybe that would have solved every world problem ever.
j .k .rowling tried to pet snakes and she got bitten.
as a person who actually read everything jk has stated about trans issues Im befuddled how its so antI trans. she acknowledges facts about biological sex and how natal women are being erased. its beyond me. Im definitely pre-ordering the one for the switch. not just for spite but also yes to spite them. Imade sure to make clucking noises while eating nuggets in middle school as we had an insufferable vegan activist in my class. we all mocked her  because instead of being kind and maybe keeping to herself  she was like mormon missionaries if they were assholes. I reccently told a friend she s being way too soft about ace ventura as she said it was antI trans  I said ray finkle diguised as a woman  he never was a woman. it was a means to an end. also  why are you seeing trans in a man pretending to be a woman to get revenge on dan marino.
I am going to get this game soon as I get a ps5...
everything about this article translates to an eyeroll.
dev said that they re making sure to make the game inclusive for troons so I wouldn t really say this is game isn t wokealso pre-ordering any modern game is the worst thing anyone can do
in response to saira...   the line is back there hon
now I remember  because my memory lasts longer than week  people scolding us for being happy when a horribly written show based on a beloved franchise gets canceled  because we should think of all the people who will lose their jobs and its horrible to celebrate that. but ruining the jobs related to this game because they dont like the author of the world it is based in is somehow ok. how to fuck can someone lead a life where their own standards are their kryptonite.
they cant grasp the concept that just because they believe one thing doesnt mean everyone else should be forced to also.
my grandson likes 5 nights at freddie s. but he s 9 so....glad to see you drinking water.  one of these days I will stop commenting on staying hydrated  maybe.  hahaha keep up the good work.
I think there s a good chance this game will turn out to be woke though  because internally the devs must have dealt with a lot of pressure to appease and cater to the lgbt crowd.hope Im wrong but I think the jk rowling  controvery  will probably result in the game having a few cringe characters and scenes. to like virtue signal and stuff. unless the devs are incredibly based.
I say bring it on. Im tired of giving ground to people that are never satisfied.
people still have the option of waiting until whatever they want to play is given a massive price cut.
you got my like when u said you got the pre order deluxe edition just to spite
this reminds me of the orcs in dnd  they re monstrous goblinoids who are vicious and tribal  so the weirdos called them racist depictions. I asked   of whom   saying stopping a goblin uprising is antisemitic is a genuine self own  tragically hilarious too.
I ll play it as long as Imelt some snow flakes
I am getting it but it was pushed back on ps4 I think it was a good move to push it because they should not put a broken game out
cho chang should have been given a proper magical name like ron or harry!
I got the deluxe edition as well. no wokie is gonna tell me what to do. they cant do anything aside from cry online.
always enjoy these videos
I preordered the deluxe edition via steam back in august 2022 and I cant wait for the launch in february 2023. haters can shove off.
I asked the girl from the thumbnail what was wrong with hogwarts legacy and she blocked me. gotta say it feels good.
is there a surrealist and underground branch of the comic book world that Im not finding online  the superhero genre is the classic rock radio of the art form.
almost makes me want to buy it. almost...
that game looks beautiful
Im 90  sure I ll get this.  its between this and forspoken.
I can see wokies boycotting harry potter on twitter while eating a big slice of papa john s
Im not a big harry twatter fan but if this doesnt have microtransactions I ll be picking it up.
Im preordering this game for xsx  ps5  and pc now lol
I think the game dev who left quit because the psychos were hounding him and allegedly threatening the lives of him  his loved ones and probably even his pets too  you know  the typical  hipocritical scummy woke tactics.
this game launches right as I start my basic training... games looks really fun however ill take a tank over a wand any day. lol
thank you.  just thank you for the video.
they need to realize that not supporting this game means not supporting the hard working devs working on it. this game is clearly a passion project for them and in the end  these rediculess boycotts really only affect the people working on the game in the first place. do I agree with jk on most of her opinions on things in general  not really. but ill always be thankful for what shes done for my childhood. this game is more than just some videogame to me. its something ive genuinely wanted since I was 8yrs old as a kid in the late 90s to early 2000s. this is an experience I will not let anyone ruin for me. these woke clowns can rot in their little corner for all I care.
I bought it last night just out of spite I didn t buy the  70 version but I did buy the 60 Imay or may not even play it but I got my money s worth
thats logic I live by  never trust a man in a dress!
they do owe their careers to her daniel was found in a cinema  a normal kid who never auditioned.emma read the books and auditioned specifically for hermione because she identified with her - she auditioned because of the books.not sure about rupert but also not sure he has a  career  so to speak.they re all ungrateful and pretty gross
lmao  5 minutes after joining the conversation on sairaspooks tweet  not insulting a single person and already on her blocklist   girl works fast.
not to sound rude  but for future reference  hermione s name is pronounced  her-my-uh-nee. also  Im on your side here. I cant stand cancel culture because they try to ruin a lot of things that I love  like harry potter. so  if you do see this  just know that I dont disagree with anything you said. Im just dropping some wisdom on ya  lol. great job on the video!
kay  I ll order it next opportunity. can I get it on steam
I bet the game is going to be super woke but they just dont like that one thing.
Im a 33 yo  normal  italian guy. I love hp and Im gonna buy the deluxe edition of this game for sure  seems like a relaxing game to play after 9 hours of business analysis and irl shit to deal with. I honestly think these people are just lonely people  leaving their lives in the safety of their houses  taken care and pampered by the western society  the same society that they despise so much. I hope for these people to have their lives turned upside down  I hope for them to be forced to take responsability and become tougher. itsounds like Im wishing for these people to have real problems in life  thats exactly what Im wishing. of course  not talking about crippling  unsolvable problems.
I like blood origin so far.
after 2k23  I will never pre-order any game. no matter what.
they hate everything  including family  games and fun
bear with me here guys  but what if this is their plan to somehow get people to buy their game by paying or having folks try and call any chances to get the game as bad  so that the people making it look good so that people get their game
stay strong brothers   sisters! shun the heresy! resist the lure that is preorders!the emperor protects!
now Imight order it for multiple platforms.
Im reeeeing over hogwart s legacy preorders  too.... cos nobody should be preordering games.check if a game isn t unfinished or full of glitches or even if it runs on your computer  before buying it.thatsaid though  a flying mount as a preorder bonus is pretty smart.
I pre ordered deluxe edition
I read all thr books a looong time ago. not a fan of the movies. in fact  I think I love the world but dont like the characters that much. hogwarts legacy was made for me. all the world there to explore and no harry and friends. already preordered too.
it is wild to me how hard they are going after rowling after her incredibly milquetoast disagreement with the woke ideology.
imma pre order the game now
thank you melonie! you know  I wasn t even going to buy this game until these people started this garbage  on my wish list now.
I ll be preordering the deluxe edition next paycheck.. screw em
I would never have guessed thatsocial intelligence would regress to the point that reverse psychology is the dominant marketing strategy.
people really need to differentiate the work from the author
the wokies said I should boycott this title...so I bought the deluxe edition
will be streaming this game as soon as I can. I almost didn t buy it for a very different reason. the sony 1 year exclusive content is a much bigger gaming party foul than any political crap they want to try and push on this game.
Im trying to get the collector s edition
I legit only pre-ordered this because I have money to burn and they flipped out a few months ago over the game so I bought it.  I ll probably never even play it.
for some reason I initially read that as wookies  like it was a joke of sorts.  ah  the woke  they wont be satisfied till they ve eaten all of their own.
Im buying the  100 bundle
the reason I am hyped for this is because you could kill and torture other npcs.
her moany
anyone else notice the radio silence from the usual suspects who would have made a 10 minute video about the hogwarts legacy and how it backfired so hard  if it wasn t the lgbtq mafia and instead something from reddit or 4chan
noice  seems like a fun game.
is that a cara dune cutout in the background   cool !!! bring back marshall dune !!!!!!!!!
if wokies are screeching about it  I guess I have to get the super deluxe edition
im preordering the digital deluxe
these people are just mad because they love harry potter but their cult wont allow them to have fun and enjoy anything. so they try to ruin it for everyone else.
still buying harry potter legacy regardless of these people
lol at that thumbnail  melonie haha
not a fan of harry potter even at all really although I wanna give it another shot..that being said this is my personal choice for goty it looks incredible..im 100  going to preorder it when I get paid on ps5 and I will love every minute of it...this article has to be satire theres absolutey no way lmao
you know  they keep throwing the word  controversy  so much these days its basically lost all its meaning. now its quite literally equal to simply any sort of disagreement. pathetic.
lol  exact same boat as you.never was a fan  but just buying it for all the tears it will cause.
you guys should look up what jk is up to with the women of scotland with the  women wont wheesht  movement.
not a harry potter fan.  for some reason its starting to grow on me though.  cant figure out why ...
Ive actually started boycotting the harry potter kids who started talking crap about rowling like she didn t basically make them the stars they are now
when they bring up isms when they see a big nose  it just shows how they themselves judge people by those standards.  they out their own prejudice
thats not true  the goblins are teaming up to take over our characters power  not the wizarding world government. l article
its stupid that they want to spread their hate within the gaming community. this is a non-issue to me  my friends and my family. they are such effing hypocrites. they dont want to be dictated by other people s beliefs but they want to dictate their beliefs to the whole world  the narcissism and hypocrisy is beyond the scale. so yes  Im gonna be one of those people who will buy and play just to spite.
I love harry potter  do not know if going to pre order
this woke cult needs to get out more or something . they never quit. p.s I cant wait to play this game
why do we need justice for goblin
I dont like harry potter  even though I was a middle schooler when the books came out  but open world rpgs I love. if the game is 100  hours Im all  in. also sticking it to cancel culture is a plus
Im not convinced that grint  watson  and the others made their comments to throw her  under the bus . instead   I think they said what they said to save their careers. the woke mob will   without remorse   destroy anyone who disagrees with them.  I was so disappointed in radcliffe and grints cowardice  but not surprised.
yoooooou only watched the first movie     mel!!! they get so much better!
much as I enjoy spiting the wokies  I wont be preordering. I ll certainly buy the game if it comes out and looks fantastic  but Im not going to enable greedy and lazy publishers just to get one up on the woke ones. Ive learned my lesson with preorders in modern gaming  and I cant sacrifice one principle for another when I could just wait a bit and support the devs after release.
based gamer girl strikes again. great vid!
Imay just have to buy this game. if wokies are mad  do I need to know more  I didn t know you were Christian  kinda new  very cool! me too!!
Im a potter fan. read all the books. love it. when it comes to pre orders Im not fond of that  it promotes releasing a broken game  cashing in on extra money and fix the game properly after the launch  I dont like that. bethesda s biggest screw up- fallout 76 is a prime example. then cd projekt red screwed up 2077- it works great on pc though lol. the witcher update has had issues. bethesda seems to have learned their lesson and postponed launch of star field  hopefully it will be ready this year I hope.
so basically if the woke cant have harry potter they ll make sure neI one else cantoo because they attacked the author so simple biology and can steal harry potter so they want to try to destroy it
didn t really know about this game thanks to the woke jokes.
I thought about getting this but the trans in it made me go against it... now I want it again lmao
the wokeies only went after troy because they thought losing the lead might be a big enough blow to halt production and not enough dirt on other high profile talent involved in the game to get more people to quit or get fired.  that is why they are still complaining and trying to intimidate people  because his leaving didn t work.they are very desperate at this point because they have run up against something they aren t used to. a studio who wont cave in and stop producing a title and a creator who has shown herself to not give a shart about what they have to say.  rowling is very very dangerous because she has a huge fanbase  has finished off her book series  and has no money worries.she has no one to rein her in because she doesnt work for anyone. her books and the movies are done and cannot legally be sold or broadcast without her getting more money.  she could possibly get deplatformed but the left cant ruin her life and leave her destitute like they would love to.  they cant make her beg and apologize.emma and daniel  even though I canthink of them as cowards and ingrates  I can at least see why they would do so  their entire profession is built on image and relies on studios hiring them.I will predict their next move.  chat harassment of anyone who dares to stream gameplay.  2 methods are 1.  they will just show up in numbers to overwhelm their chats with negativity or2.  post hate racist content in numbers large enough to overwhelm mods and get them either suspended or unable to easily post their streams on youtube without editing out hours of chat.
get fixed years later....youre an optimistic one.after everything said about that game  maybe I should buy it. sound like fun
and I think to myself what a wizzzzzzerding world.        do think these people need to get out more.
ive done my research on her and she def made dumbledore gay from the begining not to please a woke audience she even went as far as to develop thatstory line in her feature movies fantastic beasts it was no fluke it was a natural thing she felt for the character. as a lgbt person I think that its pretty cool imo. as far as hermonie being black she did not say she was  she said she could be black because she did not specify the race in the book. however she casted emma so we can assume she was intended to be white. as a lefty myself I dont think jk is transphobic. but I also think you took some of her words out of context to spite woke ppl imo. I agree with your take on twitter though. also cancel culture is just stupid for both sides. anyways wishing u the best
not that I talk about hp with any frequency but imma start saying  hormonie  if it ever comes up.
when two tags  of three  for that game are unlikeable protagonist and capitalism... Im no harry potter fan and I probably wont get the game but when the heroes become the villain  ie  daniel  hp himself  radcliffe  emma  hermione  watson   rupert  shithead ron  grint  while the villains are the based in reality ones...
I find this all so weird... the devs removed genders from the game to  stick it to jk rowling  but they are still raging at the game and its still getting massive hype  so they are staying silent  because they sided with the squealers and are still getting childish flack lol.
I feel like very few people are actually rrreeeeing over this game  hun...
ah its nice to be neutral in the culture war  I can enjoy all the games out there lol.
my mum always told me never to trust a man in a dress   or was it my dad
harry potter is set in britain. the diversity in the movies and books actually represent the british people
I cant wait until keighley capitulates and pushes this game out of the 2023 game awards. assuming it ll be good.can you imagine what shitshow we re facing
first time to post a comment.  harry potty  made me lose it!
that person has no idea about the goblins  huge projection. the goblins are portrayed as being super powerful with magic  their valts are impenetrable from the entire wizard community  save voldamort.
5 59 new sound bite lol
are we sure they re not mad that you actually have a ps5 given how difficult its been to get one
these people do realize that the goblins want to kill all wizards even the ones there working with
I pre-ordered. I never pre-order  but this time I ll violate my own commandment of thou shalt not pre-order. even if I never play it  I still consider it  70 well spent because reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
if lunatics are saying f you for buying a game  we re doing something right for a change.
if you make woke people mad  then youre doing something good.
I want to get the game but Im not impressed  their tactics of hiding extra bonus material behind special editions and pre-orders. an age old tactic to squeeze more money. though that being said  I d just go for standard and play the game nonetheless.  I just dont like that tactic which is a cheeky corporate gaming tactic.
it is kind of funny how the wokesters are always so angry about something.  while I get to be happy just living a nice life with my wife and kids.
cant wait to play it. day one.cope and seethe rowling haters.
I dont get people that are so angry and outraged over everything. all it does is make me want the thing they are upset about succeed more. Im not a harry potter fan at all  but if people want to buy this game  so be it. life s too short to be so mad. relax  chill and be more selective on what mountains youre going to die on.
well now Im just going to buy it out of spite. just for those people.  thanks for showing me this  good thing I saved up my money.
Ive only watched the movies and my best friend lewis is a massive harry potter fan  he s read the books and watched the movies. however he s sceptical when it comes to this game  hopefully it will have a good story  interesting lore and interesting characters.
we non-workies should support hogwarts legacy.
pre-ordered  and gifted to 5 people.
dont people have more important things to worry about  eggs are  6 a dozen now  even higher in other places. even wokies gotta eat  right  - or are they all on the dole  of course  the only game I play is euchre  and the deck we use belonged to my grandparents.
I dont pre order much... but preordered deluxe edition because of the noise made by haters.
idk about the whole  looking to be angry  thing. I just like my trans friends and dont want to actively put money in the pocket of someone who goes out of their way to invalidate and show how much they hate them. but go off I guess
gosh  how much I hate cancel culture in every possible way... what happened to  if you dont like it  dont buy it   but thats really the thing nowadays isn t it  just unhinged  hating  on things in your private closet of doom isn t enough  you gotta openly s it on it and other people  for having a different take as well... but honestly  making up a racial discussion about fictional races  in a fictional world  with a fictional story is so far out of line  that I cant even put it into words...because in the end  you could translate that ridiculous take onto basically every story in games  books movies and tv  as soon as there is any type of conflict within the story. and that is just absurd. by this point even I get neck pain from all the head shaking... gosh...as for j.k. and the rest of the discussion  Im beginning to fail to see the point in discussing those topics at all... if one cant even have a decent discussionabout those topics  or just having your own opinion on it that doesnt align with the  narrative  of some  is already enough to be called out for being  phobic  then that kills any and all common ground to have a conversation at all... its a convenient way to muzzle people. this way nothing will get discussed  argued about or solved ever again.
I bought the deluxe edition.
I think the woke mob will also be upset for the rumors going around that warner might reboot the movies. more money for rowling!
17 00 that males sense.
this game looks absolutely amazing and if it reks these cancer culture types then its just a bonus.
definitely a streisand effect going on with this game. the more they whine  the more attention this game gets.
congratulations to 100k subs
interesting that these are the same people that demand yourespect them but will turn around and harass  assault and bully anyone with a different opinion. straight up could not give a shit about jk outside of her being the one to create the world of hp  the boycott hurts gamers and devs more than it will ever hurt jk rowling
hope its game of the year
so much wrong with them. 1. these are the people that pretended that jk didn t write the books so they didn t feel bad about buying merch and are only boycotting the game cuz they wouldn t play it anyway. 2. they re definitely the racists for making those  connections  to the goblins and of course they re mostly white  its 1900s england. 3. the goblins are siding with dark wizards  it literally says this so of course you d fight back  it doesnt make you an antagonist.
I have two copies of the game  one for my pc and 1 for my xbox series x.  I am an old gamer who remembers when you had to use multiple 5 1 4 inch disks to play games.  well  my first game was pong  actually.   I dont really care for the opinions of people like that   they dont influence me at all.
wow  maybe she s a Lord of the rings fan.
dunno I bought it couse it looks fun and always wanted to play in the hogwarts universe. and if I would not play the game I would just buy it just for the reason to trigger the wokies
lol I also ordered the deluxe
somebody I knew personal accused rowling as to being racist stating thatshe portrayed house elves as black slaves due to how they were dressed  ignoring hogwarts was very diversed with students by race and for the record...slaves in general dressed in rags. so this person just told on herself as well.
beyond pumped for this game. but if they pushed alphabet agendas down my throat constantly I ll be pissed. I say that cuz our herbology teacher is lesbian.
the patel sisters were played by s asian actresses.  its been several years   what made their outfits a mockery  that particular one was a new one on me.
I cant believe that the article had the nerve to say that the pocs in harry potter are shoehorned in. are they suggesting that one south east asian person and a pair of indians in a wizarding school in britain is too many  if so  thats surprisingly based.
when some1 starts arguing about human rights of fictional race in a fictional story  you know something has gone hard off rails somewhere in our society.
petition to leave politics out of games  also frank   zack turek made a connection of harry and Jesus  not saying he s Jesus but he has more connections then any other hollywood character
this game upsets woke brigade Im definitely buying it now...
these people realize rowling didn t direct the movies right
Im too old for harry potter and grew up on far less woke fantasy  but always here for pissing off the wokies. even if it was written by one  they always eat thier own.
so true. they hate real woman.
the crazy thing is jk rowling has never said anything transphobic.
dont preorder games tho wait until it drops  a lot of games are dropping in an incomplete state. worst is that wokeness in gaming has literally taken it over.
hmmm maybe I will buy some myself
its even more funny seeing rowling get called transphobic and hateful and all these things yet they probably ignore the fact she wrote a book at some point with a transgender person being the maine character.  my mom listened to the audio book and really enjoyed it and she isn t even a big fan of the transgender idea.
this is hilarious
soon as jk rowling started growing a backbone and standing up to the mob  she gained way more respect in my book. all she is saying is women are women  the audacity.......
13 17 that makes a little more sense because in attack on titan  the way the eldians are treated by the marleyens is similar to how nazI germany treated jews
I already bought the dark arts pre order so they can whine all they want. they wont reee too my face.
just makes me want to preorder it more. good job sjws. Im now preordering it when previously I was going to wait to see if it was good.
what if its just a reverse psychology marketing campaign    dont know could be
sjws screeching about this video game is the best advertisement for a game Ive ever seen.  Im really seriously considering getting this now.
I dont know if this game will be good or bad  however being told not to buy it... .. I preordered the deluxe edition. I dont care if I dont like it  it was already worth my money.
I wonder how theyll act when they find the actual real world case of the guy in a dress that hunted women
I saw this trending yesterday and couldnt believe my eyes  but it was funny reading all the replies thanking these nutjobs for reminding them to preorder the game with some even posting receipts.
woke crowd  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee dont support jkrme  prepping for a kill everybody challenge woooooooo
itshould be a rich looking game at 85gb.  horizon forbidden west is 87gb.
seriously I cant wait for hogwarts legacy to come out the game looks promising and epic Im just going to ignore the woke community.
wake me when twitter is dead and gone.
no one should ever pre-order games  regardless of circumstance. make them release a working  functional game before they get any money.
already bought the deluxe edition for the ps5  and guess what I have a new pc coming soon and guess what Im going to order the deluxe for that too then Im going to eat some chic -fil-a  to top it off.  .. say something else wokie
so rolling has nothing to do with this game. also  this is going to ba an amazing game  which I already own  and these haters are going to miss out on a fantastic game. but truly  if you dont want to play buy it then dont  but dont shame others for doing what they want.
I dont care at all about harry potter but woke people just make me want to buy it and help making it the biggest game of the year.Im pretty sure that even if Im not a fan of the franchise it looks like an amazing game to play.
this shit makes me hate humanity bro ong I ll buy like 30 copies if I have to
someone should tweet these haters a list of all the most significant products that people buy that that were invented by someone that held beliefs they would despise.  Im guessing if you look around your house at all the objects therein  about 80  of them were invented or developed by someone you might find reprehensible.  get over it  or be consistent in your world view and go live under a rock with your principles.
@melonie mac go boom funny detail is that that game is releasing on my birthday febuary 10th well one of the releases are I think they are doing it console by console I dunno
the recent tomb raider games are awesome. what didn t you like about them.
I am not a fan of harry potter  but I will be buying this game  just to spit on the faces of the woke mob. an enemy of my enemy is my friend so I will give the developers my full support.
I honestly wish people would stop pre-ordering their games  it has made game devs lazy and has led to a games release basically being the beta test.  before pre-orders were a thing game devs actually had to test and fix games to make sure they worked on release.
I cannot stand hp  but I am getting this game just to spite them.
her moan ie lmfaoo
I still dont know why people want to boycott this game
if only the developers had opened the game up to modding  and these folks had a sense of humour  - instead of a puritanical  predictable boycott  someone could have wizarded up a satirical mod in which you have to convert all the students to gender reassignment and voldemort replaced with... I dunno  some sort of malenia-esque female villain...
I wonder they would burn their pcs next
I dont care about video games.. haven t played them in a decade... I dont really watch much tv movies... but I watch melonie mac because her personality is the bomb and she cracks me up... and she s easy on the eyes.
not a real gamer but Im going to get the deluxe edition just to piss off the thought police.
I liked harry potter when I was a kid but this game looks incredible. the souls style spell combat and being able to become a dark wizard looks super fun.  these woke losers just like to complain
watching the wokies lose it just makes me happier that I bought this game for my wife and I will buying it for myself soon and I could care less if I ever actually played it as long as it pisses off the crazy people Im happy.
goblin rights
harry potter is set in england in about the  80s or so.  in that time period  england was 95   white english.  of course most characters were white.
woketards make for good advertising lol
I only heard of this game cause of the meltdown of the left. glad I did so I could preorder it.
I want this game to be good enough to win game of the year just to see the woke people s heads explode.
do the opposite of woke and life will be better for you. that is what I know for sure.
damn melonie you are beautiful
these people are sick  we knew that tho
they re not actual tomb raider games and that isn t actually lara croft  so Imean... good games  sure I guess  but not tomb raider games.
@melonie mac go boom  well its an origins story. and by the end of the third game she becomes the actual tomb raider from the original games. so from what I understand is that if they make a 4th game it ll be more along the lines of the original lara.
@brandon pick  its not actually an origin story  crystal dynamics lied about that.
@xtremenerdpat  weather its connected to the original or a reboot. its still technically an origins story.
ok so im not one of those wokies but I do have a problem with this game. first of all it doesnt use any of the books only as a reference second I want to play out scenes from the book or movie I d like to be a dark wizard etc. the custom character creation is very mid so I highly doubt you ll be able to fully customize your character. I do not like that the dark arts has restrictions no two player nor online play and I can care less about going into a dark forest and joining the arena fighting bots npcs especially during a time period when dark wizards went unchecked. this game was supposed to be like gta but with wands and we aren t getting that and Im sick and tired of playing as a child in the harry potter games.  I want to be a full on adult living in this world its been 25 years and your still a child still! the online app they had two but scrapped it early last year and it was like pokemon but only you played as an adult wizard witch is much better and you can duel anyone in the world you also get to see characters from the books and movies and play out certain scenes. I feel like this game is a bait and switch because as a hard core harry potter fan we aren t getting any of that at all whatsoever. I feel like this stupid woke reason is just smoke and mirrors to hide what Im saying and when the game drops how long do you think it will be before fatigue sets in   the npcs bots are not interactive enough for the price tag so I will not be buying this game besides who in the heck cares about trolls!! or a troll resistance ! seriously. bait and switch watch.
if they re wanting to cancel rowling over her book that involves a transvestite serial killer  they should cancel silence of the lambs and buffalo bill.Im sure thatsotl isn t the first  only and last book to have that type of character either.
I wasn t interested until now!! lol
funny thing is  due to woke people hating on the game  the sales will sky rocket because of controversy it caused.they did absolutely the opposite what was intended
never intented to buy it cause I dont care about harry potter  but now I kinda wanna buy it just because of these people.
I read all the books as a kid  and watched the films when they came out  but as an adult  I cant really bring myself to like harry potter anymore  since when I compare it to other fantasy stories I have read  it just doesnt seem that well written to me. the plots are heavily padded with the magic school fantasy that doesnt really appeal to me anymore. the 4th book was especially egregious.  I find the whole quidditch world cup part of the story is boring and long-winded  and alot of the world building doesnt really make much sense to me.
game looks decent  got a good deal  have 72 h early access and make woke people mad  first game I pre-ordered in ages
already preordered a copy on ps5.
everyone buy two copies  watch the chaos lol
Im honestly a bit unhappy that Im not interested in harry potter  still  eventually the woke crowd will notice warhammer 40k  that will be my time to shine.
blows my mind how the woke want you to accept all of their philosophies and ideologies. but will not listen or accept anyone who has different beliefs. are we really to believe that they are perfectly realized beings.
I just ordered 10 copies
I have no interest in playing this. however  I do have disposable income and Im debating buying it anyways just to add to the meltdown
gotta remember  these are the same people who tried claiming video games are making children violent
Im pretty annoyed being cunning  calculated  and underhanded methods are labeled as the only evil house for the 3 other ones to bully but  I just want to play a magic student academy simulator. it could literally be anything else. if its problematic  gimme an alternative lel.  - also  it would be much more acceptable if she was more informative and let people decide on their own  rather than demanding   virtue signaling her identity as a member of the wokeism.
the sooner these companies realize that these woke activists are the minority  the better. but that is still a long ways off  if ever.
at first I read  wookies  in the title.and even  ree  checked out cuz they do kinda sound like thatwhat s wookies  problem with hogwarts anyway probably not enough representation  which is fair... not a single wookie in hogwarts.
I dont understand their argument  its not created by her but inspired by her books and world she established over the years. Im not buying the game with intention to support her opinion but to play explore the world I grew up with
they think their words matter just goes to show the delusion.
you know every time they say something garnered criticism all I hear is pissed off the wokies. and being that 9.9 times out of 10 thats a good thing Im okay with it
not to be mean  but if I was a gaming company present day  I would pay for this backlash. Imean  we could market all over the world and social media and dont forget commercial spots. or! I could light a fire on social media with some tweets. seeing how many people are pre ordering this game is  imo  the issue with this world. we are so fast to be against something we do not stop to think does it matter  if the game is good  let it come out  get enough proper praise  then buy it. let it earn your money. at this point it could be a broken mess but you dont know. still. most probably bought digital because of ease and no refunds once downloaded. look anything against the woke  cool. but y all  for all we know the whole game is about helping a t person find the magic in them. or side missions filled to the brim of woke stuff.  I have not seen a single comment from the devs and their point of view. most side with the woke  still drop a woke product  and yet itstill isn t good enough. this could be no different. product are meant to be bought. the way to get you to buy isn t that hard to figure out. wake up.
Imean this with every fibre  sic  of my being  fuck you if you buy hogwarts legacy .challenge accepted ...your place or mine
its always amazed me thatsomeone will cut off and turn on something they love  just because the person thatstarted it did something they didn t like.you know that 95  of the people complaining about this are people who loved harry potter and got their feelings hurt when the writer of their favorite series didn t march in lock-step with them on every political issue.  did what rowling say change the story they loved up until the moment she opened her mouth   did the gryphendor house logo all the sudden appear as a reich-emblem in their eyes just because rowling didn t agree with the indoctrination-like exposure of kids into the lgbtq community  or the way trans-rights were being given media preference over womens-rights  essentially men pretending to be women telling women to sit back down ....   Im not saying what s  right or wrong .  Im not saying how anyone should or shouldn t feel.  but to begin to hate a book series   franchise just because you dont agree with 100  of the things its creator says seems like cutting off your nose to spite your own face.   if you look to take offense in something  youre sure to find the offense you seek.  is j.k. rowling someone I d be buddy-buddy friends with   probably not.  but does that mean I shouldn t be able to enjoy a fictional universe she created or support a video game based on it  that many people worked hard on  just because she said something Imay or may not have agreed with   I dont think so.  denying myself happiness because of the words of another   I dont see the  happiness  in doing that.  that doesnt seem like a happy or healthy way to live.
not gonna preorder  I dont do that both out of principle and as a precaution. I will buy the game though if there is no problem with it.
got my preorder in. people like these make me want to buy 10 more
I never pre-order games. its just something youreally shouldn t do. gaming history is chock-full of games where thousands of people spent full price on a game that turned out to be shit.having said that  I will pre-order  hogwarts legacy   not just because it actually looks like a possibly really great game  but mostly just to spite these idiots.
love harry potter  fucken badass dark story  love
also  I d just like to point out that bollywood films  and most asian culture doesnt try to diversify when producing movies shows  but its only a problem when white americans dont include a more  diverse   more like no straight white men as the main characters  cast. if you ask me  I d say the  woke culture  is kinda prejudiced  but what do I know  Im just another straight  white  Christian male.
if you need an example of shoehorning. wow. lol.
I dont think dumbeldore being homosexual  is a retconn. they never said if he was or not. in fact I remember people were joking how he had a weird attraction to harry. though that was really just a protective nature him and another character had for him. because he is the chosen! in fact when the first time woke people complained the studio came out and said jk has really nothing to do with this game. also there are dozens of lgbtqa  people working on the game. its just a vocal minority yelling from a dried up well of stupidity!  this game is going to clean house! I say  1 of the year!  Im also getting tired of people comparing fantasy creatures and beings being a alagory for real world people. we seen this firstly in the star wars prequels. they are coming off as the bigots  saying goblin bankers are jewish people.
majority of the gamer friends I have pre-ordered the game already. great video on a bunch of adult children having a temper tantrum.
them wokers have tryined 2 ruin dc but thankfully zaslav n james gunn are cleaning up the house but marvel seriously is in trouble but marvel can rise from the ashes again like a phoenix n hogwarts looks a great example of non woke games
I ll admit it. Im a 60 year old troll with plenty of money and I ll probably preorder it just bother sjws. I already have a huge backlog of games that it would take me a decade to get through them  but I earned my money and spend it in a way to maximize my enjoyment. I also roll through stop signs when its raining when I see a cop to make them stand in the rain.
title  wokies reee over hogwarts legacy preordersvideo itself  1 woke person reee over hogwarts legacyyou better go to steam discussions. you ll find more than 1 person going reee there.
progressive   the goblins are clearly meant to represent the jews! its an antisemitic stereotype! richard spencer liked your post
there s no controversy  just a boatload of toxicity from idiots who cant have a disagreement with someone without calling them  phobic .
gonna pre-order this game for ps4  ps5 and switch
Im going to pre order the deluxe edition for my son and i.  definitely worth spending the money supporting this amazing to be game!!!!!
woke... what did they wake from  seems like they are dreaming this shit up. I for one will be playing and streaming the hell out of this game.
hermione suddenly being black was dumb  especially given the artwork in the books showing she clearly is white. that being said  dumbledore s sexuality was never shown in the books  so him being gay isn t a retcon.
I dont even like harry potter  but that fact that the left is butthurt over this makes me consider playing it lol.
urge to preorder.... rising...
Im not into the  woke  movement  but seeing these comments comparing lgbt people to pedophiles made me realize that I dont want to spend money and give to someone thatsays awful things about lgbt people  Im not a trans person myself even  but as a person with empathy I decided to atleast wait for the cracked version of the game  not spending money even if I love harry potter and the wizarding world since my 8 yo.
loft pixels level take.
the game however will have an   inclusive   character creator that caters to the anti-rowling activists.
under developed  just like the woke are.  d I preordered a few  just because. this game will become game of the year.  d
goblin lives matter  glm
please dont pre-order video games. pre-ordering encourages studios and publishers to behave in the most anti-consumer ways imaginable  and routinely push out a buggy unfinished mess instead of a finished product.
this woman really likes tomb raider.
so a bunch of cultists that represent less than 1  of the population is thinking about  boycotting  the game. it will be like a kitten biting a big dog  it will acknowledge it  but ultimately it will make no difference. game looks great.
if this woman who spread hatred towards those who buy hogwarts legacy would be against games in general  racism  sexism and homophobia are common in the gaming industry. even in the movie industry the fashion industry is even worse. I despite jk roling nevertheless why do I have to stop liking the harry potter franchise I grew up with     I despite everyone who treats others bad  humans are so evil towards eachother and itsucks.
I would generally agree  but your arguments are fairly easy to dissect for anyone whos against your opinion
wish I could like this twice for all the boomrants in this one lol
at this point  Im going to preorder the game just to spite the crybabies.
I have no interest in this game for reasons that are different from the wokies who hate it. I am finding their meltdown over the game hilarious. they often end up turning on their own since they are a bunch of narcissists.
Im lost what s the issues with the game
I used to enjoy gaming so much more when I was a kid you just bought a game you didn t have to deal with all the forced politics like now
5 10 phenomenon  its a cultural staple at this point... there is an hoa in my area with a posted speed limit listed several times across thier neighborhood as 9 3 4 mph
technically annie in them and even the people with aaron were supposed to be a jewish standard you cantell it by the armbands they wear and the fact that they had to live in camps and ghettos its literally supposed to put that kind of imagery to mind
the biggest problem is  these people are acting like the world is in black and white. the very same people being called transphobes for wanting to play this game are a lot of the very same people voting and figting for lgbtq  rights but I guess all that dont matter if you play hogwarts legacy  none of the support you show and fight for in any other means for these people to have a voice dont matter. im glad im not a harry potter fan  I dont have to deal with the heartbreak of the entire fan base being labeled transphobic because its creator came out as one.
lol
thats it Im buying it when the price lowers games used to be affordable to the massive now there too high and peoples weekly pay is lowered too low for the prices and its getting annoying
ok  jk rowling does have a lot of ww2 references in her books but she has always used hermione as a character that points all the flaws in the magical society and its politics. I feel like most people who are talking about hogwarts legacy both hating on it and defending it have just a very basic knowledge of the books and doesnt bother to do some research. the goblin s revolutions are a super interesting topic in the books. the ministry of magic in the books have never been supposed to be the good guys either. wizards are supposed to be very prejudice since they are isolated. come on people.
well ... sounds like he got quitted
this game sounds fun - create your own character and attend magic boarding school. Im down. meanwhile  I couldn t care less about harry potter. I care even less for the antics of insane  stupid people.
do leftists realise that a fictional world doesnt have to be paradise its not as if jk made the wizards out to be saints  the ministry were incompetent and corrupt as all hell. at no point did she state  this is how a wizard government should work   just that in her world of fallible characters  thats how it does work
nobody nobody melonie  hermoanie
I wasn t a big fan of harry potter.  the movies were ok  but as someone who has read fantasy his entire life the books weren t anything special.  they took tropes and parts from other stories and mashed them together.  and Im not really a big wizard fan  I prefer swordsmen and other action heroes.  but something in the presentation  the subtle lore  just appeals to me.  and I put down some birthday money on it.
I thought goblins and elves were different
Im sorry but I gotta say it  the way you say hermione is freakin  adorable!!!
check out this person s youtube channel if you d really like to gain insight into the mind of a wokie who peddles this lunacy  a simple search of the author s name pulls up links to all the author s profiles and articles . definitely a   point of personal privilege  point of personal privilege  type. not going to link it myself because I think they obviously have some sort of condition and would never make fun of that aspect  but itseems to be a common denominator amongst people with these views. its almost as if there s a nefarious plan to normalize mental illness. Imean  this is exactly why ryan created the creedthoughts word doc on the office  some thoughts just aren t meant for the general population lolaaaaand I used zero gendered pronouns in this comment. I know how offensive that can be
streisand effect. good job wokies everyone laughs at you.
you learn something new every day.  today I learned that goblins are jewish.  does think make elves catholic   are orcs protestant
my money  my right.
people are really angry and rowling for stating thatshe supported the word  woman . I ll never understand why people are so sensitive in their self-centered bubbled view of the world
I love the controversy around trouble blood. it exposes the inherent contradiction and insanity of woke ideology. the wokies cannot claim or be upset about it as  an attack on trans people  because the book describes the indivdual as a man. not a woman  nor a  trans woman.  wokies believe that trans women are women  but the book describes the individual as a man. wokies hate men and love women  so the fact that they are outraged just proves the contradictions of their own beliefs. these people are living embodiments of cognitive dissonance and a testament to the power of imagination.
wtf thatsaira has me blocked too    Ive never interacted with her. she must ve just seen the comment Imade saying the reason why Im looking forward to it lol
as a straight white man   the most hated group in america    I liked harry potter but I loved legacies. hope michaelson is perfect and lizzy was funny as hell.
someone needs to sound the alarm  the wokies are coming  paul revere you shoulda warned us about the wokies too!
not a huge hairy potter fan   but it looks like a amazing game . and seeing woke people crying about this game   made me pre order the deluxe edition too .
unironically  you finally covered something I am interested in  since I am an rpg gamer. this game has bigger problems than the one these people like to look at. first  you can only buy on the microsoft store  on pc. second  we re dreading that they re going to try to do something souls-like.like... dont just get on a bandwagon just to be reactionary.
it wouldn t be a go boom video if I didn t mispronounce something
@melonie mac go boom  can you at least say orangutan right
its available on steam and epic for pre order as well.
I dont have a ps5 and will still buy it cuz am broke right now
goblins have looked like that for like two thousand years. the irish had goblins like that in folklore before a single jew ever set foot on their island. they are showing their own racism when they look at that and say   thats racist!
they also lied when they said the potter series has a deversity problem. theres black characters  indian characters  russian characters  french characters  asian characters. they are full of sht on that front.
read all the books back in the day  watched all but one of the films  but never played any of the games. fun memories. but to tell fans they shouldn t be allowed to enjoy something because of personal opinions of the author makes me a bit miffed  to say the least. j.k. rowling did set herself up for being attacked by the wokies  but has a right to her thoughts and opinions the same as everyone else  and you know what  Im pretty darn sick and tired of these kinds of people declaring themselves to be moral authority and the last word when it comes to trans people and trans rights  which  as far as Im concerned  they appropriated yet again for victimhood points. because thats all they can see in someone else s disability  or sexual orientation  or medical condition or whatever--that they re a victim. its extremely disrespectful. but thats just my two cents.
dont listen to the woke haters. they re buying this game too. they just wont announce it.
jk rowling said nothing wrong
Im not against your channel  you make alot of good points  with regard to games Im the same  problem is the higher ups spend more money on well polished trailers instead of game testing and demos  they expect the gamers to test the games and the devs get the brunt of the hate.
hermoanie  id like to see that
I dont like harry potter because mages are annoying but I pre-ordered the deluxe because I cantolerate mages over wokies  3
this harry potter stuff just kills these young woke types because so many of them  knowingly or not  made harry potter a core part of their life. for a lot of them  harry potter took off right before or after they were born  and they literally grew up with it.you ask them what books they ve read and its harry potter  and marx . what movies  harry potter. they write the fan fiction  frequent the forums  and buy the scarves. they go to the theme park  they have hp tattoos  they ve memorized a very potter musical  and know every potter puppet pals skit by heart.and every time they talk about someone they hate  they either compare them to hitler or voldemort because they cant help but color what they see with at least some degree of the harry potter film thats coating their narrow lens. with some of them  itseems like harry potter and is practically all they know.and they loved all the woke tweets jkr used to make  to them  she seemed to say all the right things about feminism  race  and homosexuality. when people asked if hermione could have been black  she was like   well  I didn t say she wasn t black...  and they all clapped or snapped or did jazz hands  as dictated by their degree of mental illness. and then she said the wrong thing about the new cause du jour  and they suddenly wanted her dead in a ditch.they so very desperately want to continue loving harry potter and will use any excuse to justify doing so  the foremost being that if they aren t putting money in jkr s pockets  then its still okay. I guarantee you that the majority of them want this game so bad they cantaste it  and it is making them even more nuts than they already were.being the misguided weirdos that they are  they d prefer that harry potter be seized and controlled by a gigantic  for-profit  corporation  rather than see it in the creator s hands. too bad  so sad.a slew of them will still buy it  but they ll do it on the down low  because the woke types are nothing if not hedonistic hypocrites. my guess is that there are about to be a lot of new steam accounts showing up  with only one game on them  hogwarts legacy.
I am disappointed in hearing this about chewbacca and his relatives. I expected better from them
people really need to get better at idemtifying when these types tell on themselves. literally nobody is identifying goblins with jews or orcs with black people. nobody was talking about that being a thing until they insisted it was racist... Im not gonna pre-order anything  and haven t since I pre-ordered batman  arkham knight on ps4 back in 2015   but this game does look pretty fun. the game let s you ride griffins. that is awesome. the fact the wokeists are being children about it is just icing on the cake.
2 08  hey  this tweet made it on the comments section today.  enjoy both channels.
damn that personality test really thought melonie was like looney luna. she has to not be telling us something lol.
not a harry potter fan but buying it to support the non woke movement
got mine on preorder  cant wait tbf gta hogwarts is going to rock! fuck you if you dont buy it
I have never cared much for harry potter  but if buying this game pisses the wokies off  then now I have an urge to buy it  as well. amazing how the uk  is infested by the wokies  just like the rest of europe. now thats a legacy of the eu.
melonie mac fitness model
I was planning on buying hogwarts legacy regardless! but now that I know that the liberal snowflakes are trying to cancel it  Im going to preorder it! vote with your wallet people!
they re not entirely wrong. the origin of those particular fantasy beasts was based on jewish people. some still use them as allegories for them  truth be told  but let s not get into why.anyway  as you noted  they re such a heavily established creature in the fantasy genre that the connection has long been lost. tl dr  this is just another case of hypersensitive people taking offence at anything they can.
I am looney tho lol
too bad I am buying 2 - one for me kids and for theit friend as a gift - gowokegobroke
the controversy  like the real reason  Im 89.9  sure   is that in the game.. you can play... as a white person!  startling sound  for dramatic effect also  chiming in as a jew. the woke do not speak for us. no one speaks for us. but the woke types say their quiet parts out loud far too often. every atrocious culture  religion and movement throughout all of time has claimed to have the best intentions.. shortly before they started slaughtering people they disagreed with.also for funsies  here s my take on Christianity in the hogwarts irony topic you sort of started.  its in playfulness  I promise. Christians  strongly dislikes witchcraft and wizardry  to the point of public murders also Christians  literally worships a necromancer and calls him the equivalent of God.pick a lane   p
hImelo  wassup    will this game fail    I am asking cos I just prepurchased.
the goblin slayer manga and books show the most truthful version of goblins.. in any fantasy realm . they are parasitic chaos beastmen that exist only to corrupt all that is holy  good and true. they are an embodiment of evil that when ignored only grows stronger..until they  goblinate  everything in the realms around them.the harry potter  universe  goblins are a far more sjw friendly version.however I take the  goblin slayer s  point of view on them. I would be worried about what they are planning to do with all that money they hoard...
I was gonna say  why dont people who want diversity make their own creative projects instead of injecting themselves into others  fictional stories  but then they did do that and aren t those movies and shows tanking   you still have to put in the work.  when are people going to realise that diversity doesnt automatically mean good content
I am mr.cancel culture.
the people calling hogwarts legacy antisemitic have never played a fucking fantasy game with goblins. I dont get how it makes the games antisemitic. in most fantasy media goblins have always been depicted with sharp teeth  bat like ears  hooked or pig like noses. and they tend to be short  and stubby or tall and lanky. goblins have always been depicted as greedy  shit if anything hp plays down goblins cause goblins are generally violent  mischievous  and greedy. in warcraft there is a reason goblins say  time is money  they like gold. I think people are just looking into the shit too much.as for rowlings comments and the bs on twitter. I know people in the lgbtq  community who are buying the game  mainly because they are huge potter heads. I have multiple trans friends who are getting the game  and personally dont see how a video game represents rowlings comments. I am bI sexual  and I bought the game. this stuff is just driving more people to buy it just to piss these people off. let the people who sit on twitter and say  if you buy hogwarts legacy  fuck you   your a transphobic bigot   your a homophobic bigot  say it. the way I look at it is. if you choose to buy a game. thats your choice  and dont let the idiots on the internet bully you with their constant toxicity. there was one person on twitter who said  if you buy hogwarts legacy  you are not a safe space or an ally to transgenders and the lgbtq  community  firstly  who the hell are you to say whos a safe space or not  second  if you are bullying and attacking people just because they bought a game and want to enjoy their lives and not deal with this crap. are you truly a safe space for anyone  I and many others were bullied for being bisexual  or gay  or trans. these people attacking others online just shows that they aren t safe spaces and are bullies.
the problem with naginI being a south korean woman is that it is just plain old bad writing. jk claims she always intended to work this twist into the original story but couldn t fit it in. so as along time fan when I go see the movie and all the characters are like yea naginI was always a woman Im just sitting there like  stop the
the left doesnt deserve good story telling and big popular franchises like harry potter. look what they ve done to star wars  witcher  rings of power  the list goes on and on. Im not a huge hp fan but if itsticks to the world the books built and doesnt throw a bunch of woke crap in there  I ll buy it for myself and my friends.
I would buy this game simply because it will pass off woke lunatics. I wont though  Ive bought it already because I like playing open world rpgs and I liked the harry potter movies. its absolutely matterless if a few woke review sites slate the game because the vast majority of reviewers  even the so called independent reviewers are just industry shills  either directly funded by the gaming industry or will want to maintain their access to review codes and exclusive give away merch that bring their channels exposure and interaction. this game  just like elden ring will show that woketards can not stop a game simply because it doesnt put woke ideology front and centre.
good video luna love good is based just like you by the way
preordered my copy awhile ago  and the only criticism this game will get from me  is as to its quality. no woke idiot will keep me from enjoying the hell out of this game  only bad gameplay can do that.
I have bought the digital deluxe for my pc and ps5
the mental gymnastics they must go through to come up with this sht is just hilarious. you must represent every race  that can be found in la  because they dont care about actual minorities  in all media despite where or when the story is set... buuuuuuuut at the same time  no people of any minority race can be cast as a villain  you cannot give them a name or clothing that is common in their culture  you also cant ignore their culture or  whitewash  them in any way. you also have to ignore the fact that the location or setting has a predominantly white population and be ok with all the black  latino and asian characters or be labelled a bigot. women can only ever be strong. men can only be strong if they are gay or black... and of course at least one person has to be trans...  as if anyone needed more evidence that we are living in a clown world...
Im getting old.   I respect 1970s feminism...I respect the 1980s early 90s gay community  Im old enough I remember when being gay could get you beat half to death . I stopped respecting those communities when itstopped being about equality and started being about preferential treatment.  whoever started using the word equity was a marketing genius.  itsound like equality but is the exact opposite.  I explain it to folks like this.  equality is the idea everyone can run in a race.  equity is the idea that you should trip anyone faster than you so everyone crosses the finish line at the same time.
melonie  thats  like calling  water is wet
most Christians love the sinner  but not the sin. that is how Jesus works as well.
I truly cant understand this  why do this to just one game that no one on the dev team or the whole company said. talk about how activision had sa and swept them under the rug
I love the outrage from the people about this game  yet they have amazon and twitch accounts...no boycotting a company that has horrible working conditions  okthey have iphones  ipads and apple watches... no boycotting a company thatset up suicide nets instead of improving working conditions  no  okthey were branded clothing made in sweatshops...no boycotting on that  okall of these are arguably worse  and have much more real life impacts that whatever this game can do. and its so stupid. so the only options is to either let the entire franchise die  or wait until jk dies before we can start making hp content again so she doesnt profit off of her own property  not going to happen. its very easy to  boycott  a game they had no intention of buying in the first place. I cannot wait to play this game. if people dont personally want to play this game  then dont  but leave the rest of us who do want to play alone.
now I do see goblins as jews those woke people seems pretty accurate to me on this one the real question is why are goblins prevented from that   same reason as why the jews expelled from 1000  locations since recorded history
and you should get your wizarding world account ready before hogwarts legacy as you will get mask and fanatical uniform for all 4 houses
her-myuh-knee
I absolutely hate woke ideology. I was part of the early woke mob and got out before I was brainwashed. I flipped sides because of the trans rhetoric and gender psychos. I love rowling  absolutely love her. she absolutely got those little brats their start and they turned on her.
when you pander to the wokes lunacy it is never enough. never bend  never yield  .just point   laugh at them.
not to pour fuel on an already raging fire  but isn t all this hate from these woke folk against and aimed point blank at  gamers  really negative and massively damaging to their cause. I do not see how perpetuation of hatred is helpful in any situation to any cause no matter the subject  but this hate is so misplaced its laughable.
well  I wasn t planning on buying this game before  but after seeing this I sure am going to now!I love it when lefties get angry. the only thing I like more is being a part of the reason they are angry!
I never been a harry potter fan too
Im pre-ordering the pc deluxe version and the ps4 deluxe version  ps4 and xbox one come out 2 months later . add Im going to stream it because Im supporting the developers and everyone who worked their butts off for this game. also  the game devs even made the character creation super inclusive so you can even make a transgender character. also they had no creative input from j.k rowling in the making of the game. apparently hating on one person is more important then supporting these amazing people who are giving us the experience of the lifetime!
gryffindor!!!!!!
cant agree more melonie. I have no problem with movies tv series games with only black  asian or white people on the screen. if the story supports it then great  go for it but if it doesnt  ekhm blood origin  then dont push for all the cmyk colours and alphabet lovers. the story and worldbuilding should be the top priority and everything should be based on  if itsupports the story  and not based on the dumb  californianesque  view of the modern world  not everybody lives or have been to california!
o.k  I understand.  rowling essentially called the trans community a bunch of sickos and now the wackos of the world have their panties cinched up their sphincters.  piss on  em.  I dont own a ps5  but Imay buy the game any way.
but the goblins are the bankers  thats proof right rofl
I dont even like harry potter or own a video game console  and I feel like I need to buy a copy of this just to upset the wokey woke leftoids!
did anyone else read that as  wookies
if this game wins a single award  there will probably be enough sjw tears to solve california s drought problem
dont really watch to many female reviewers glad to see youre good at what you do and that you seem like a cool person glad to see youre not like the rest of these people who fall to the woke.
j.k. used to be their homie. used to be they ace. now they want to slap tha taste out her mouth.
I dont play games nor do I own play station or x-box  but I will be buying the game. its so enjoyable to see the woke  pathetic  immature children have mental breakdowns.
if hogwarts legacy is in trouble then clash of clans should be cancelled for making goblins go for gold lol
imagine spending your life actively seeking out stuff that you know will trigger you   garnered criticism    heavily scrutinised    criticism is mounting   by and from whom  probably a force of 1 to 8 people  depending on how many staff are around to nod their head at the time. I saw a critique of  star trek  by a woman who probably wasn t even alive when  voyager  ended   a franchise that embodied and stepped up diversity to the point of ridiculousness in  discovery  and  picard   and had female poc personnel right from the first episode in 1966.  speaking with your wallet  is the perfect phrase because I think thats more understandable to businesses than  get woke  go broke .
what a smart woman
anyone else remember when they used to complain that the ferengI in star trek were jewish stereotypes
I preodered mine
sadly  the developers themselves are pretty liberal. they have disowned rowling more than a few times for her comments on genders existing. kinda have mixed feelings on this game. I liked the franchise but got a bitsick of all the leftist propaganda being inserted into the franchise.
hermoanie
I wanna know why its bad to be transphobic. everyone has their own opinion. Im proud to not like trannies and where Im from  I grew learning that we did certain to these gays.
tbh Im still not convinced  jk rowling is one thing the franchise is another and the franchise  its actors and the studios have repeatedly come out against jk rowling  I dont expect the game to be anything less than a complete wokefest especially considering what Ive seen of the people in charge of its creative decisions none of which particularly strike me as normal.case in point  diversity  wasn t one of the first player characters they debuted black  dont you think this was done on purpose because the creators share these ridiculous woke concerns  again they re complaining in anticipation or perhaps as reverse psychology  but I dont expect the game to not be woke so Im not buying it anyways. and sadly I think it ll be woke af  its gonna sell like hotcakes and its gonna be the ultimate monetary vindication of wokedom in media thats gonna ensure more franchises follow suit  Im expecting more reverse psychology  Im expecting the woke stuff to be hidden from the promotional materials etcbecause the wokists have realized by now that  get woke  go broke  is a thing and its starting to turn corporate favor against them  if you keep the messaging but hide it from promotional material you save your job  maintain the woke messaging and keep the corporations on-side.
pre-ordering games are a bad idea
I understand not wanting to support someone that made terrible remarks about a group of people. I agree that I am a weak person for not doing the same. however  I shouldn t be criticized for wanting to play a game and support a developer that is making quite literally what is a dream game I have been waiting for  for almost 15 years. there have been a lot of assumptions about the story of the game being anti-semetic and what not. its ridiculous to judge the game thats not out yet. its ridiculous to hate and call people names and assuming that they are transphobes just for wanting to play a game. I guarantee these people that are boycotting and screaming at others for not doing the same still listen to chris brown  still watch disney  still buy stuff on amazon  etc. if you look deep enough  every big company does terrible things. unless you are ready to stop consuming content and goods from all those companies then you have no grounds to judge other people. idk  I am excited for the game  already bought the deluxe on 2 different platforms.
I am buying at least two copies just to spite these people! one for ps5  one for switch.  and maybe one for ps4 series x
I outright refused to buy this game on playstation because of their scummy ps only year content. I did however buy it on pc because it was going for  45. couldn t pass that up. I still wouldn t buy it on playstation because I have morals.
so I absolutely loathe the retorik in this video. trans rights are human rights and jk rowling is an aweful person. however hogwarts legacy has basically nothing to do with that. they have disconnected voice type from the sex of character  they have publicly stated the the author has no say in the creation of the game. most of the problematic points from the book are story specific and thus not a part of the game.
jk rowling is not transphobic. its disgusting that these people turned on her
lol this is so backwards. you would think if anyone had a problem with the game it would be Christians . I only say that because the entire franchise is based on magic. Christians are forbidden to practice magic  spiritism  astrology  summoning and things of thatsort like tarot card reading or fortune telling. I dont care a whole lot for harry pot head . I am totally onboard with your view on feminism .
I pre ordered  may not even play it  its not my kinda game  I just bought it to add to the numbers
this game looks really good. Im sure this game will sell good and it will show that the loud minority is not the majority maybe hollywood will take notice.
so... their complaint is that a book set in england has too many indigenous english in it  Imean its stupid enough to be an sjw take!
if I had the money I would buy this.not to play it but just to piss off the bad faith actors wasting their lives trying to control others.
dumbest reason for protesting anything ever. I hope they realize the game is going to have massive sales.jk arowling  reality is a thing. wokies  reeee! burn it all down. Im not big on harry potter   never was...but damn this game looks freaking awesome!
wokies cry  I preorder. its the easiest decision of my life.
I dont agree with jk rowling s views on transgender people but I think she is allowed to have whatever opinion she has and if she wants to use her platforms to speak out then that is on her. Im not a harry potter fan never really was but Im looking forward to the game because I like open world rpg s and need something to play for my ps5
I still maintain that jk rowling was one of the reasons we are where we are today. she was for wokeness until wokeness came for her  and she has not changed any of her opinions on anything. she just believes being born female is different from transitioning to female  which is a sin punishable by death according to the woke. she still identifies as being a feminist  without acknowledging it did exactly the same thing the trans movement is doing now. buying this game to own the woke is kinda self defeating. buying it because you like the game  I can jive with that.
damn Imight actually have to get into harry potter just to see the wokies piss themselves in anger and protest.
having read jk s original tweets  I fully agree with her - there is a place for transgenders but it is not in women s sports. I am so disappointed in feminists standing aside and letting transgenders ruin women s sports. its as if the feminists are scared to stand up to the  very confused and highly destructive  woke community. what happened to their fight to be treated the same as men I am even more disappointed in emma watson who once stood for women s rights through equality. the other actors can do what they want to rescue their flagging careers but she should have put more thought into where she came from and at least tried to find common ground.there is a simple solution in the sports world - create a new category for trans athletes to compete  so men  women  trans. if they wont accept that  then they clearly care more about their gender acceptance than the sport  so kick them out of the sport completely. we all know that the men identifying as women will almost always win over the women identifying as men  but at least it wont be ruining women s sports and careers.imo  the woke community are like isis - they should have been wiped out when we had a chance but now they are forcibly spreading their ideologies to multiple countries. never back down.personally  I welcome a person s right to self-identify. but I absolutely draw the line at any attempts to force children to change or to reduce the rights of women. its the old rule  do what you want  but not at the expense of others.
what is their complain   I have no idea
yikes  you were doing so well until you spoke about your own views on trans people. you may have trans friends but you are definitely transphobic  you may care about them but your views are transphobic.definition of transphobia   transphobia is a collection of ideas and phenomena that encompass a range of negative attitudes  feelings  or actions towards transgender people or transness in general. we will focus on your negative feelings towards your trans people... Imean  friends  and your negative feelings towards transness in general. trans women are completely erasing everything it is about being a woman  being a woman has turned into a costume  - are you implying trans women are just men in costumes  they certainly are not and that is a transphobic view  do you want me to tell your trans friends that or shall I  perhaps they will see your video anyway. trans women are women. whether or not trans women exist or not does not threaten your womanhood  you identify as a woman too  great  your a woman  good for you  literally no one cares whether you have a uterus or if you menstruate  would you like an award for that  do I think that its healthy  I dont think its ideal  I think it is ideal for everyone to accept themselves how they are and how they were born but hey everyone has their struggles ... trans women do accept themselves how they were born  they were born women in the wrong bodies and they transition so that their bodies can match who they truly are. trans women aren t forcing their ideology on anyone. trans women are standing up for their own rights as human fucking beings  to be treated by other people like human fucking beings. they are standing up for their protection so they aren t discriminated against by employers  by law enforcement  by healthcare and by transphobic people. trans women are standing up for their protection so they aren t brutally murdered because they were born in the wrong body and simply wanted to change that and live their lives peacefully without transphobic fucks taking away all their rights.do I agree children should have to wait until a certain age to make decisions regarding transition  to some extent yes.I am a lesbian woman  I have trans friends and I accept them for who they are and I truly support them  you do not.I will be buying the game regardless of jk s views also.but you should be mindful that just because you have trans people... Imean friends in your life  doesnt mean you aren t transphobic or have transphobic views.also youre right  the whole goblins are jews and the game being anti-semitic thing is absolute bullshit!gotta dislike the video though for your views on trans people!
melonie  your tweet was oddly narcissistic and satanic by your very definition of the term. you cant assume that youre entitled to consume things just because you want to. thats self-worship. youre entitled to believe that it is good  but not to buy it if you or your fellows have good reason to assume its bad.  I have no problem with the harry potter franchise  only with hypocrisy.   r.g.
these people take games and books way too seriously
well the goblins are very j like..
modern day book burning.
lol less streamers playing it to compete with am I right
good vid siski
Imight buy it just to piss someone off.
the world is messed up  best ignore it.
I always get slightly insulted when people compare jews to the goblins in harry potter. Imean  come on  Im not thatshort
anything making the woke mad makes me happy.
I haven t got a ps5 but Imight pre-order it just throw up a middle finger at these woke individuals.
u are 100  luna thats really cute so its very accurate
so they re so desperate to find something to virtue signal about that they re screaming about the victim hood of fictional characters.....I cant....
part of this is jk rowling s fault what s the point of being a billionaire if you cant do and say whatever you want
can we cancel the alphabet people they try canceling everything they dont like!
fightin  gaaaaaaawwwwwwblins  huh !cue the toto  if you know  you know
Im not saying she shouldn t speak  I said she done goofed when she pandered to the woke crowd because they turned on her
no pr is bad pr  p
dude was I wrong or did lil mac go all asmr voice on  only women menstruate.
streisand effect  more you complain - the more eyes are going to see what its about. I ll probably buy and see what its like.
I stand with j.k. rowling
I am to busy I pre order resident evil 4 remake all dlc
a reeesurgence  v
a woman mad at another woman for saying only women can be women
who is  hermoanie
if you are interested watch all movies and try to find characters who are basically a symbolisation of nazis u will understand why certain people do not support this franchise  d
God people are complete psychopaths. she didn t say anything thatsign in every 6th grade biology book
Im not a harry potter fan at all.
yep Im going to pre-order five of them and I dont even like harry potter
the woke take the life out of life.
it is very funny watching these people losing their sh t about petty stupid things like this.
I normally dont buy preorders  but  Imay do so this time  and may also buy a few more  deluxe editions at that  and give them out as gifts. if the woke mob can unite to cancel people  businesses and games  movies  music  etc. then why cant we unite to not only un-cancel their cancelations  but also boost them  this should be an easy win  as this game actually looks better than most of the drivel the games industry has released in recent years!its funny  the woke religion had no issues with the wizarding world   none  until  their high priestess  went rogue and started spewing  clutches pearls  - truth .  now    suddenly   they can find  everything  wrong with it  including but not limited to -wrong-think  anti-semitism  and hate-speech where none existed before. hmmm  that would seem to indicate that they were either lying  then   or they re lying  now   perhaps they  never stop lying  both to themselves and to others. seriously  these people would be hilarious if they weren t so damned dangerous.
wokies hate it. free marketing.
her moan ee
11 19 subscribed!!!!

cant stand wokies  they really need mental help. cant wait to play this game its gonna be amazing
I will be buying this not only because it looks fun it also pisses off these losers
Im reminded of how a ton of people were upset that most of the zombies in re5 were black. the game takes place in africa!
jk rowling is a grifter .. she even grifted when her books first cam out. she included some Christian themes in her book and even said as much. ultimately by the end her book became antI Christian theme
so  gorgeous
muggles...
is the game for xbox
I truly feel this woke rant against the game is just a tactic to make ppl buy the game  imagine if all a company has to do is say woke ppl dont like our product to get guaranted sales. im not a harry potter fan but im a gamer who wants good games.my prediction is the game will flop  hope im wrong.
thanks play it and have fun
who cares what they think I paid  85 for it and ima play tf out of it thats what wrong with people always tryna cancel something
a rich punk random killing had a party with a big guy wearing a bra.... in the punk circle its kool
sometimes you make sense and other times not so much
leftists   we need to cancel planet of the apes because the apes were villains and everyone knows apes are.. african americans.
do you even realize that the game is still woke either way  they bent the knee over a year ago
hate is useless.
people been waiting for this type of game since it first harry potter it would have been five times better if it was multiplayer but who cares
the indian outfits for the patil sisters were ugly but they weren t mocking to indian culture. like wut
people are going to still buy the game regardless and if its any good then jokes on them.
goblin s and there culture
well f me bcuz I pre order hogwarts legacy lol
I wonder why feminists are ok with saying a word with  men  in it  when it comes to  womenstration .
aw thank you so much!
she made a lot of sense here.
@ashkihyena  she made a lot of sense in many regards  and in others  not so much
goblin lives matter. lol.
fwiw  the chick that tweeted that is an of girl  so who cares what she thinks
k .... is the game good tho
ill just download it illegally. people can like harry potter but also dislike jk rowling. it doesnt have to be all or nothing... theres a lot of gray area...
they dont even play video games
could this  outrage  be on purpose   like u said its causing more sales.....maybe the game is trash and they r doing this to get preorders up  and the game is booty hole garbage lol.. ..just asking
u gonna play the game  which house do u want to be in
the wokies get a taste of their own medicine.
the harry potter story takes place mostly in england  who cares!
dont buy unfinished game at full price. even if you like harry potter.
I dont why people are tripping over hogwartz I say play whatever you like to play people are easily offended and want to cancel everything
why do people quit jobs after contreversy  stick it to them and hold your ground
what s her name
its not an ip I give a shit about  Ive never been into harry potter. if I was into it  my focus would be on the game  after cyberpunk andfallout 76  Im more concerned about the game being finished
all the harry potter names are crazy and silly and often stereotypes! wut! ! cho chang is not unique. malfoy  weasly  tom riddle  snape  dumbledore
marry me
I identify as a non-binary goblin and I find this video highly offensive....Im shaking right now...
when did being cognizant and compassionate get twisted into this woke nonsense
never pre-order. itsets a bad precedent for propping up hype and unfinished games.
are people now pre-ordering a game they re not particularly interested in just to spite the wokies
I test hufflepuff every time on quizes  so I ll go with that
@melonie mac go boom  lol there are quiz s
I believe to each their own but dont force the shit down my throat and manipulate children that haven t even gone through puberty and have no idea who they are is wrong.
the stars didn t do that
hello dear how are you I hope everything doing good for you I hope that guy is in jail you are a gorgeous and beautiful woman I like the video you put up and if you every need to talk you can find me on facebook and instagram  ok
have you ever spoken with a  wokie   or do you just dehumanise them on the internet
these people have to have something to be offended about. stay salty  haters. the rest of us are going to enjoy ourselves.
this transguy cant wait to play hogwarts legacy. already pre-ordered it.
3 10 and this is why I buy older games from amazon  because... newer games are broken  and not good. so... older games are better  just like manga is better than most dc m-she-u  comics.
woke think will destroy everything thats fun. it offends me.
I have a bump on my nose because I broke it as a kid. am I suddenly one of whoever crowd the woke losers are trying to  protect
lol
wait  how can indian actors  playing indian characters  wearing indian dress be considered making fun of indian culture  wouldn t it be whitewashing if they didn t represent their heritage
thats cool I dont have to watch your channel. hope you catch the loser. no need to punish the messenger though.
woke is irritating
doesnt matter if abunch of idiots. dont like what others do with their money.
oh no  somebody on the internet said  fuck you if you buy this game.  whatever shall I do
your the first person Ive seen salty woke about this game or any fans. your weird lol.
always use reverse psychology with the looney left. if they say its bad   phobic   ism. its actually good and none of the things they say it is.
never trust a man in a dress
actually depressing because the devs make cave to this garbage article
youre so beautiful I love you
if it pisses off the woke left  then I am all in!! ordering now.
this game is also releasing in xbox one x  xbox series x s  nintendo switch and pc. dont buy it in woke imposing and pro china ps5
people dont believe what they believe  oh how sad
there are too many white people in harry potterthe books are set in the uk in the 90s  when the population was 94  white. in the late 1800s  it would have been something like 99.9  white.
really sticking it to the wokies by preordering   supporting a game made by  wokies
seriously these people need to get over it  they are just making this game more popular   more money the more they bitch moan   complain idk why they cant see that lol.
clean your mic.
men and women are different and only real women menstrate
just bought the ps5 and pc version. love to see those woke ppl getting mad
thats why I stopped reading all those bullshitsites. just picking the smallest amount of crap to make a big deal out of.
the only thing I hate is you buying the ps5 version... ahaha. steam all the way for me. I just hope the game is good  it ll suck if its bad and now they ll get to go  haha you wasted your money on a shit game . plus I d say we re about two decades overdue for a decent hp game that puts us in the story instead of retelling an already existing thing.
literally only preordered it because the snowflakes wanted to cancel it.
they removed gender so im not going to play  it. its defiantly an omen of what will be and not be in the game.
happy potter fans drive me nuts. so this is nothing new for them to be mad about this. this is on the same level of hate cyberpunk2077 get.
keep politics out of video games. I dont agree with people who dont even play games attempting to tell gamers to boycott games for any reason.
wokies....     super cringe!
why do you agree with these people that this is a controversy  you are buying into their framing.
the goblins in the harry potter universe have their own society! why would they want to go to hogwarts  youreee-tards...luna lovegood is spacey  yes  but thats because she s thinking about things more deeply than most of the other students. there s a whole section in one of the books where luna rightly points out to harry   if I were voldemort  I wouldn t want you to feel like you had any friends  harry...  which is exactly what s going on in the book. so  spaced out  but right.
I never once thought goblins represented jews.  this just seems like woke projection!
Christians beefing movies is weird and disgusting. and I grew up Christian
I preordered 5
but they added trans characters
woke always crying for something we need just ignore that people at the end of the day looks stupids with out much effort
as a guy with a big nose...I find their remarks offensive! I can smell their bullsh  through this screen. Imay not like harry potter or have any interest in the game  but they are tempting me...
in aot all the eldians are jews.
woke people  we re all about diversity and letting people be whoever they are.normal functioning brain people  oh  ok  thats cool. I like insert literally anything here.woke people    cries and reeeeeeeee
jk rolling said nothing wrong. Ive never seen any harry potter movie ha
damned if you include diversity and damned if you dont. Im so sick of this crap.
best games are free to play. fortnite no build and cod mobile.
I dont know about harry potter goblins  but its totally fair to say eldieans in attack of titan are fantasy stand ins for jews and the holocaust.
you wanna know what s hilarious about the woke mob comparing the goblins to the jews they based their conclusion off of stereotypes...let thatsink in for a second.
I have my own non-woke and non-Christian reasons to dislike harry potter  but I love me some circular firing squads.
yeah! they totally busted themselves! equating goblins with jews  ! what the hell
there is no gender in the game smh. body1 and body 2.
oh for crying out loud  do they want me to pre-order the xbox version as well and then a playstation one  I already have the pc version please woke people stop making me buy more copies because I will!
I have to laugh at these morons who have a problem with jk rowling s book  troubled blood  saying that it tells people to  not trust a man in a dress.  I guess these people either never saw of forgot about a 1980 movie called  dressed to kill  staring michael caine who dresses as a woman to kill women! but...  its  problematic  now!
their comments are extremely racist and based on racist stereotypes...  this is clown world.
everyone bithchin made me look at the game and it looks awesome. im not a happy potter fan per se . ive never bought a game or even seen all the movies. im gonna buy this game though. what does this game s have to do with j.k. rowling  besides creating harry potter. she didnt have anything to with the creation of ythe game. a boycott would just screw the hard workers of the software company.
notice that they are the ones equating jews to goblins.
let s go cancel her. we should cancel the woke movement
good buy. the boycot is having the opposite effect because people just want to have fun and be entertained. that is why we play games. if I wanted to go to a political rally I would. no thanks. jk rowling should write a book about standing up to bullies.
Im tired of the sjws infesting gaming now. it used to be relatively free of thatstuff but no longer.
sorry dumbledore was obviously gay I always new that he was gay.
it has nothing to do with being Christian or not.Im an atheist and Im not woke. I ll play the game if the reviews are good.
I dislike harry and his pot but I heard the game was good.
I hate harry potter and these libs have made me decide to buy the game. gameplay looks ok  not as cartoonish and stupid as I assumed it would be  and if it hurts them for me to give it a chance  I guess thats good enough for me
melonie is so hot
how does everything get equated to anti-semitism  why do they waste so much time trying to connect the dots like charlie from always sunny
Im a jewish and this is some bs   I love the game and jk and allready pre-ordered it   didn t feel for a moment that they are comin aginst jews with this goblin rights thing must certainly the people makin this absurd claims are not jewish and manipulative.
no quidditch though I heard...thats weak
Im not a harry potter fan  and I actually support transgender rights  but this makes me want to buy hogwart s legacy. screw these people and their blatant authoritarian beliefs.
the fact that these people see goblins as being jews tells more about themselves than anyone else. talk about being prejudiced much...
I dont understand the correlation between harry potter and religion. like this is fiction fantasy like many other books. ss do religious people hate Lord of the rings as well and anything fantasy for that reason
this just feels like negative marketing to me.
I hate when people with new gen systems make itseem like they re better because they have a newer gaming system. like....is youreally tryna spread classism via bragging about your video game system  thats what I dont get.
jeez  what happened  you used to be supportive of the lgbt community and lately Ive been seeing posts from you calling itstupid. its just so disappointing.regarding the game though  play it or dont play it if you want. buying and playing a game doesnt make someone a bad person and also doesnt mean you agree with said person s views.
serious question  whats wrong now  is it  rowlings anti-trans stuff  is harry doing something objectionable  retconning is far more annoying. is that the problem  also  please  her-my-on-nee. please.
I dont believe this Christian s against harry potter narrative from the past. Im catholic and I never heard of this at my church or in my community.
so... anti-semitic is the trending buzzword now.
its still witchcraft tho at the end of the day. jk rowling isn t against homosexuality and gender for the sake of righteousness its for the sake of her cultural beliefs. harry potter is about witchcraft and divination and shouldn t be promoted.
makes me want to get it even more
@joseph rosario  kinda the point of negative marketing yeah lol. its when you intentionally cause an uproar to get the product your are advertising seen by more people.
@joseph rosario  yes  exactly  and now all those people are giving this game their attention and spreading word of it. would you ever have heard about this game if they hadn t complained about it  I wouldn t have. and because of people who just want to counter the woke mob  this game will do better than ever. its a marketing companies wet dream because they can still play divisive games which attract more attention and drum up business for the product. Im not saying the people who are mad are faking their outrage  simply that its by design.
@beast of bourdon  well its not by design in the context of what youre saying as in there was no planning on creating false complaints about jk rowling and its connection to this game  its by design due to the fact that the marketing companies are happy that you have these insane people screaming against jk rowling and its leading to people buying or at least pre-ordering this game in large numbers in fighting against the first group.
@joseph rosario  yeah Im not saying they created the group thats complaining Im saying they knew these people existed and used them for free marketing to us. kinda brilliant when you think about it.
@beast of bourdon  I agree
there was. there were protests. it was a thing in the 2000 s.
buy and play whatever you want but dont you dare be gay or trans
that article is so cringe  literally 0 knowledge about the world and lore of wizard world.
just a correction. annie was severely racist lol
I dont fucking care what they think or want. I need a good game and this looks awesome. let this punks cry  I say.
woke is really redefining racism for the world we live in. goblins aren t jews.
goblins are antisemitism  that is a bit of a reach
oh yeah  Im buying 3 copies. what better way to show these woke idiots than giving cnn s parent company money for a video game where you play as nonbinary minors.but seriously  not a big hp fan but the game looks good. there s a ton of potter games out there since ps1 and some of them are actually really good.
girl and women get forbidden to menstruate - nice woke peoples.
saira looks middle eastern  isn t harry potter english culture  is she some kind of cultural appropriator
Im buying two of the games so all you people that dont like it get a way to your house and clean it up and then shut up
harry potter has probably the worst fan base
another year of that   ! !
wokeness is an oxymoron. it makes more sense when you call it head up the butt disease
everyone that is bitching about diversity in stories...write your own!
hard pass harry potter is for women
yes. harry potter  a franchise set in england  the birthplace or the white race  has too many white people. by the way  as an englishman living in england  I dont like to be refered to as white. I prefer indigenous.
imagine seeing goblins and you think of jewish people. makes me wonder whos the racist.
how much anime do people watch that has exclusively asian people  I cantell you there s probably less than a thousand black people in poland today  the fact that the witcher has any in it is all shoe horn
cho chang is racist... I guess the people who write these article dont even care that it is a perfectly legitimate chinese name. but the goblin are jews allegation is even better. how canthey sleep at night knowing that everything can be a alegory for all the wrong thing in the world
honestly  this game looks a bit boring to me. it looks like a typical fantasy rpg  but you are limited to being a mage.
you do not know what an oxymoron is.
everyone is mad because jk rolan made a factual statement
the wokies hating on a woke game now I definitely will not be buying this game because I dont support woke bs.
dont preorder  definitely wait for reviews. this game s developer has only created shitty disney games  so Im very doubtful this game will be good.
I saw where somebody actually said the Lord of the ring dwarves were jews!  and that tolkien is racist. making up random stuff and grasping at straws just makes your argument stupid!
tryhard
is everyone just gonna ignore that this game is woke  emitting the use of the word  women  or  female . character creation allows for trans creation. overly diverse cast. I will not be supporting any woke trash  including this game.
awww the conservative is mad grow up
Im a straight white male from a country famed for its  colonizer  history  so one more reason for the woke mob to hate me doesnt matter  Ive already pre-ordered the deluxe edition of this game.
omg I cant believe a liberal game article just called all jewish people goblins. you cant make this sh   up!
no. she s pointing out crazy people are mad  then you  another crazy person  are showing everyone you didn t watch her video.
