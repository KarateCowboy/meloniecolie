women can be unrealistically huge and strong  and stomp men all over the place in life or death scenarios  and thats totally  modern   but heaven forbid a male character make the subtlest advancement on a female character. in uncharted 4  nathan can beat up on 5 men at a time  but cant handle a black woman. even women with some training will have a tough time against untrained men. thanks  druckmann.
them   I cant believe people are so bent out of shape over this  it doesnt affect the game real gamers   I cant believe people are so spineless today that they believe this humor from a video game would physically and mentally someone hurt someone. but the fact that they support this sorry excuse for censorship without realizing what else is to come from the idea of censorship is just sad and really says how out of touch the developers and the censorship supporters are.  seriously  its pathetic how stupid those type of people are. they censor such harmless content in the name of  feminism   but then  triangle strategy looking at you  remove the word  woman  because its a  hurtful term        so let me get this straight  we censor harmless  flirtatious dialogue  and even biological terms  yet pornography is still being promoted by cities  websites and big name companies     even p d0philia gets promoted!!!! clown world doesnt even scratch the surface of how stupid this whole human condition has gotten.
pretty sad to see anyone censoring anything in this day and age  especially when the name of the game is resident evil seems a bit counter intuitive.    congrats  on being an aunt.   Im sure everyone here prays for a safe delivery and a healthy baby.
hearing  leon!  you pervert!  whenever ashley was on a ladder always made me chuckle.
looks like the presidents equipped his daughter with ballistics too
congrats on becoming an aunt! also I do need a prayer from you and the chat melanie as I am struggling with mental health. college alongside the pandemic took a toll on my mental health and I felt like Ive never recovered not to mention the tomfoolery news of people and our government doing stupid things everyday. Im slowly trying to find ways to keep myself mentally stable and your videos have been helping especially the Bible quote portion of the video. keep on making great content and go boom!
the focus these folks are putting on the up-skirt stuff tells you just where their own minds go. pretty telling stuff. would there be some random dude out there who got a kick out of looking up a pretend game character s skirt  probably. does it really matter  nope. pretty sure there are more important things to put focus on  but hey  guess these people writing the articles gotta project their own internalized perversions somehow.
getting sick and tired of stuff getting censored. I am super excited and happy for you being about to become an aunt  mel! you will be a kickass aunt! speaking on carnivore diet  I am proof that a carnivore mostly carnivore diet works. mostly carnivore diet got rid of my depression  anxiety  and bathroom issues  fibre caused the bathroom issues and possibly some of the anxiety and anxiety cause that issue as well at times . it gained me more confidence and helped me gain 19 lbs  was 100 lbs and am now 119. just need 6 more lbs to be considered normal weight when it comes to myself  and muscle as well as definition in my upper arms  shoulders and back. its been a huge help and I feel the healthiest I have ever been in my whole life. I generally limit myself to just meat  eggs  dairy  protein shakes  protein snacks  pickles  bananas  for shakes  and potatoes. the meat I tend to eat are chicken  boneless skinless chicken breasts  wings   beef  sirloin steak  ribs  patties   pork  bacon  ham   shrimp and fish  salmon  haddock  tuna  sardines . other meats I like to eat but dont have often are turkey  clams  scallops  lobster  deer and moose. for junk food I ll get a container of assorted gluten-free cheesecakes and two boxes of little ceaser s pizza  unfortunately not gluten-free  once a month  and  very rarely  ice cream. I am generally very strict with my diet. I rarely consume veggies  broccolI  carrots  cucumbers  spinach  cauliflower  other than potatoes and pickles  grains  gluten-free pasta  other than pizza and certain protein snacks  and fruits  tomatoes. yes  tomatoes are a fruit  not a veggie. fight me  other than bananas. I also drink zevia once in a while for a healthy soda option and it is the best option.
I appreciate you not wanting to just drop everything and rush out  but rather making a couple videos to hold us over.a bonus factor is it will keep your algorithm rankings up while youre away congrats on being an aunt and congrats to your brother and sister-in-law
one of the funniest aspects of r4 was looking up at ashley  you didn t actually get to look up her skirt in fact  and her saying   you pervert!  stupid to remove that!
congrats on the new kid in the family.  throwing shade at wesker thats a definite no-no for me and ashley was always annoying in the original game unless you had the knight outfit for her.  ashley always get onto leon if she was in front of him climbing a ladder or something which fit the game scenes perfectly.  my wife and I are doing the mediterranean diet and I like it way better than keto.  because restrictive dieting can cause yo-yo dieting thats why I like mediterranean diet easier to stay on while not getting cravings for stuff.  though whatever diet works for you and helps you stay in good health I say for it.  we can be our own worst enemy and overthinking can always cause problems thats my assessment.
5 25  it always felt like there was a much bigger age difference  yeah because she was raised spoiled and he d clawed through hell by the time they met. not even mentioning their ages  he s a war vet and she s a college student  they could be the same age and there d still be a giant gap between them.
these videos have become my favorite way to end the day. today s verse succeeded in causing tremendous anxiety for me  though. Im battling with a lot of what you talked about. Ive managed to get myself into a position where pain seems to be the only outcome  no matter what I decide  pain for me  or pain for others. I believe Im strong enough to bare the pain  however  because the thought of the alternative tears me apart. Im hoping Im an exception to this rule. time will tell.
being an aunt uncle is everything. there s just something that lights you up about it.  d
instead of changing classics for the  modern audience   how about the modern audience gets over themselves!
congratulations auntie melonie!  you will be a great aunt.  I love your content and you are helping me make better choices and getting healthier.  thank you.
c mon that line about ballistics missiles between luis and ashley was comedy gold. a little cheesy  yes but still made players crack a laugh no matter how many runs of the game you did. the skirt reaction.  its like that anime trope of dont look up when the girl is somewhere high  these panderers just want to take the joy of the stuff we like even if their sales suffer from that  how companies that need to make profits let that happen  beats me
didn t ashley hit and yell at leon if he looked up her skirt  doesnt that  y know  discourage such behavior
tween me was too busy thirsting over leon to notice anything about ashley lolol I dont remember re 4 being so wild in  terms of problematic content. congrats on becoming an aunty!
awkward relationship ashely had a crush on leon.....like where s the issue.a fella showed up and took on an entire cult for her and she ended up with a crush and made flirtatious comments.like no shit.and as for luis and the rest of it  well all I ll say is comedy is immortal so they can keep trying and failing to make people as out of touch as they are.
more like anita sarkessian.
@zoloft77  her too.
hope youre ok
@neil varma  Im trying my best to hang in there.
hey! Im one of the prayer leaders in melonie s discord I just realized how pretentious thatsounds  but its true  it is a role there haha . would it be alright if I copied this prayer and added it to the prayer requests section there so the discord peeps know to pray for this  and so we can pray for you during our weekly prayer meeting  also  I ll be praying for you as well.
@sygos  sure
@mrdarkace28  k  on it!
they recently censored spider-man s  homophobia  too lol  they re such a joke
meanwhile aloy has the entire planet wet for her and thats fine but one gal falls in love with a muscular handsome badass dude thats too much ok bro
I d love to see an update video about those sales tbh. if youre going to force censorship instead making it optional then you mostly likely aren t going to get as much money.
so at what point does ashley crush leon s head with a golf club
drive safely and congrats I can see your excitement.  congrats to your brother and his wife. child coming in to the world is life s greatest gifts. Im pretty sure he going to be a gamer lol. have fun!!!
Im so looking forward to them making ashley look like abby from lou2 in the re4 remake and lead leon around like a puppy.
I was trying to make sure that the vr version never existed in my mind so its out of sight  out of mind
enjoy seeing your videos  gratz on becoming an aunt. spoiling kids and sending them back to parents is fun
hey melonie  I wanna let you know that I recently prayed for the first time in ages. and I think you   your channel was influential to that.
my body has only ever reacted negatively around girls who are lizards. Ive just learned to not try to date a lizard.
the player was never able to look up ashley s skirt - at least not on the ps2 version. if one tried  or just moved the camera up when she was going to jump down from a higher elevation   she would cover herself and call leon a pervert. Im surprised that didn t make the suit of armor costume the default and only one.
so I think this got their attention because on one of the remakes there is an achievement of looking up her skirt  there was also a  hey  animation where ashley disproves of the action. it was a small quirk in an old game  something teenagers would chuckle at but considering other titles like dead or alive extreme  catherine  or bayonetta its something completely forgettable. its always strange how they change the female characters  but yet the male ones are always the same  I guess luis being a stereo typical  spanish playboy  is perfectly fine...
congratulations on your pending aunthood! youre going to have a lot of fun getting to spoil the little one.
you know the engine change from original re 2 3 to re 4 threw me out of resident evil. in never got into re 4 I eventually came back for 7 and 8 I enjoyed them and the remakes of  2 3. I have fun  there was enough nostalgia in the remakes that itsent me back to playing re2 on the playstation and getting jump scares.
if the really wanted to  remove sexism  from re4  then they would have made ashley more competent and had the game less like an hours long escort mission
I am kind of a pleb on the current vr thing. but I am waiting for the type of vr  if it is plausible and possible to be implemented here in the real world  like the ones from sword art online and accel world.
congrats hope things go well
hell   being able to look up ashley s skirt in vr was the only reason I wanted to buy this game.
congratulations on becoming an aunt  melonie! go boom!
congrats auntie mel  I ll be praying for a quick uneventful delivery
I dont remember anything particularly bad in re4.  I do know that censorship rarely improves things.
you liked raphael huh  I was a donatello guy  but I think I was forced into it by my older siblings. we all pretended to be the turtles when we were little but since I was the youngest I didn t really get a choice lol.
which is interesting  because she was programmed to cover herself. if people cant understand that point  they cant be helped.
oh you know they censoring the hell outta bayonetta 3...
@john heusler jr  Im surprised she lasted this long
@wanderinpaladin good  all of those are masterpieces. personally I hated  hated re4 for what it did to the franchise. its a fun game and leon is a great character in it but everything else about it ruined the re series until 7 got around.
reminds me of the game where if you adjust the camera at certain angle you get a certain trophy for it. lol
congrats on becoming aunt mac. where did you get thatshirt
I never got into the re games  but this did remind me that there is a kotor remake in the works. do I even want to know what changes they are going to make
congrats on the little one hope your family has a God filled and blessed day.
lol she would have left us behind and pulled a lara croft move. left us dangling while rushing to the treasure!
I saw you mention that you like fire emblem. which one is your favorite  for me  its path of radiance on the game cube.of course  thats around when I got turned on to fe because of super smash bros melee including fe characters. I thought they were so cool. my first fe game was sacred stones
after 35 years of relentlessly searching the cosmos... melonie mac discovers the auntie-life equation. and  just like steppenwolf did for darkseid  she will share it with her nephew.  boom!  releasethemaccut
7 35 censorship will never end because the normies especially youtubers streamers  will consume and consume.
its a good thing that they know the sex of the new baby.  it would be a shame to get all excited about being an aunt  and then the child turns out to be a boy  you d be an uncle.
its cool that youre going to be an aunt  you ll be able to lift ten times your bodyweight.
congrats for your sister in-law and becoming an aunt.
things  not aging well  is rhetorical jargon for saying  I dont like it  and I wanna act like my opinion is objective.
guess they better give ada a different outfit while they are in there
congrats! how will your content creation affect the next generation
she was one of my first crushes in life...
love the hair! and congrats on being an aunt... will be fun for sure!
congratulations on being an aunt and congratulations to your family may the new arrival bring you and your family many years of happinessesp baby s parents.
ironic they have to censor such things from a  m  rated game....
congratulations on becoming an aunt!!!
rated m for flirting  and louise winking.
I think it was nier automata where you get an achievement for looking up 2b s skirt  multiple times I think
thank you! got the shirt from etsy
100
carnivore can mess with guys t levels long term  Im trying to do it myself but keep messing up with shopping and wind up getting take out every now and then  mpmd has done videos on it and one of the main proponents  cant remember which one maybe saladino  has added honey into their diet to combat the effect.
congratulations on being a new auntie babe!!!  3
congrats. bring on the aunt-itude.
I dont even understand these people who want the changes. ashley responds appropriately when luis has his  ballistics  line. to cut it just makes her seem like a brat as opposed to the  strong female  character she gets to be in that moment. its also part of luis s character to behave this way. he s kind of a dirtbag hence his previous work with saddler unless they forgot. then the upskirt literally calls you out for doing it  again with ashley calling you a pervert. the way I always seen it  the interaction was to prevent people  kids who would inevitably play it  from staring at a low quality panty texture the devs never intended for you to stare at while being funny. the  overtime  proposal is something that actually happens in real life. did the devs forget that people have sex and the game is rated m  besides that  leon is a super agent who just rescued her and is the textbook definition of a pretty boy. he shot her down the same way hunnigan shot him down. the cuts were literally pointless virtue signaling.
congratulations on being an aunt!
congratulations on the aunt thing
now I need that cheesecake recipe.
congrats on being an aunt!
ill be listening to wap when I play this game because thatsong is still okay and empowering to women. clownworld
I just hope this doesnt affect resident evil 4 remake. I want all the dialogue in there  God bless and take care.
I heard that ashley s racks are ballistic  removing this destroy the lore.
im so digging you hair like that congrats on being aunt mel go boom!
great video  mel...
hey good afternoon melonie. I just want to tell you congrats to you on becoming a aunt and congrats to your brother and your whole family. anyway I know that you will be a wonderful and great lovely aunt to your brother s new baby. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that congrats to you for becoming a aunt  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that new resident evil 4 vr video game is not great video game to play than the classic resident evil video game and I do wish that they would stop censor the sexism and just leave the old classic resident evil video game alone  ok melonie. anyway also I just want to say that and make a fine statement about this topic  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day   evening and have a great week this week and this weekend at home with your pets melonie.
melonie mac feeling a disturbance in the force. well I pray that you will find the man God means for you. so that you can say   the force is strong with this one
personally  I take more issue with how re4 censored classic resident evil out of existence  but yeah  the censorship is pretty lame.
games that are 18  rated    should not have anything censored.
and here s me still looking through a hole into the girls locker room.
meat-based is the way! for me 40lbs came right off and Im in my best shape since college. thatsaid  ngl  every time I see a pizza I want to hannibal lecter the face off the thing. grats on the little mac!
if she is 20 years old there is not an issue
which begs the question of why censorship for adult or even adult-like content in a rated m  or  uk pegi18  game
that last statement may hold true.who knows what game studio has in its closet upon saying that  activision-blizzard isn t the only one company caught with their pants down.
talk to them instead  who knows they might show you a different hole.
there are plenty of pizza recipes. sausage-crust or egg omelete base. mix shredded chicken with eggs and parmesan for a sturdy crust to name a few. top with mozzarella and whatever else.
@enigmatistic  sausage based crust  !! Im on it  thanks!
@visitor  you bet!
this game has been ported to damn near every modern console and has sold well each time. nobody has a problem with the dialogue or any of the contents so the excuses for changing anything are lame at best and pathetic at worst.
upoercutting someone s head off in mortal kombat is fine but showing breasts is going too far!!! it hurts women!!!! unlike decapitation!!!
what kills me is when people say   this day and age   in order to justify their world view.Ive coined this specific term   nunc anno fallacy   which means in latin   current year  fallacy.  this is to say  that just because it is the current year  does not imply that resident evil  or any other thing  should change in order to conform to someone s perception of modernity.  the way I see it  if there is a dated reference  then create an in-game encyclopedia to explain.  if someone is too squeemish over a camera angle from the past  they need to suck it up  or not play the game.  I hated it when the right tried censorship in the 80 s and early 90 s alluding to everything being satanic or indecent.  these days I hate that the left leads to the same conclusions of censorship  albeit by different means  sexism  homophobia  whatever buzzword .
I thought they would wait until the remake to censor the game. but alas.
1  its been fine for 20 years  why now 2  the age gap only seemed so far because leon s been flippin  fighting zombies for 10 years. Im sure thatstuff will age you... she s lived a cushy politicians daughter life.3  leon rejects her at the end anyways.
first  ashley not being highly useful in a survival and fighting scenario makes complete sense. she s the president s daughter. daughters of high up politicians are generally not  ever  highly trained field agents.second  yes  you could look up her skirt. she calls you out for it and rightly made you feel like a perv. not a major deal.third  leon saves ashley multiple times and they went through a lot together. she developing feelings for him would be natural.fourth  luis commenting on her  ballistics  I can see getting rid of. not because its offensive  but because luis would know how to better comment on a woman s figure.fifth  cutting out leon hitting on hunnigan was unnecessary. they re coworkers - it happens.
I want elon musk to buy all of these gaming studios.
this is why resident evil fans need to stop asking for a re4 remake  because of stuff like this.
congrats aunty boom!
this is why if you play on a pc  get your games off piratebay  and if you play on a console buy all your games pre-owned.
just heard that the baby boy arrived. if its ok with you Im going to pray for him right now. Lord I pray for melonie mac new little nephew. Jesus I pray that you watch over him  that you guide him and he will see your glory and grace through out his life. Lord Jesus I pray that you bless him and his family. in your name I pray Jesus amen.
so what theyre saying is that we should stay away from this version
13 28 building muscle at far as Im aware requires primarily 3 things  you have to damage your muscles and recovering  working out  the soreness is small damage   you have to have protein  you can do without meat protein  but its very difficult to do this way to the point its near not worth mentioning  and you have to have some calorie surplus  and this is where carbs come in to help as its alot cheaper to load up on carbs  and realistically your body wont fully process pure protein diets  my understanding here is you cantell when you have had enough protein by how bad certain smells are  eating more passed that point is not fully utilizing the protein  its just going toward total calorie intake  carnivore diet makes the balancing act a lot easier  but its also fairly expensive compared to a mixed diet especially for a male  could be 4-5lb of meat daily if they are muscular and actively exercising  upwards 12-15lb of meat alone if they train as a job. for me that would come to around 15-25  a day  whereas I add in rice and now Im down to about 3-6  a day  there are probably cheaper ways to do this that Im not aware of  but I have always seen carbs as just a filler food for calories. I should try caravore for a month or so once I get my workout room back
another great video from the awesome melanie. I got a question you said you love fire emblem and as a fire emblem fanboy myself sacred stones being my favorite what is your favorite fire emblem game and do you play fire emblem heroes
its not that we are pervy and want panty shots or  sexist  dialogue its the fact that they took something away from the game. if they started removing a side quest like assignment ada or mercenaries because they think it doesnt need to be there anymore we d be annoyed also. rereleases of games should add things to the experience not take away from them.
Im not even a resident evil fan  but censorship is one of the great banes of the industry. currently a trend plaguing japanese developers who are being coerced or harassed to change their visions and content to suit not just western sentiments  but the cult of woke -- people who dont even play the games or who are a minority voice. these corpos should be more focused on appeasing the majority market  but they re not. its like they believe the message is so righteous and crusade-worthy it justifies losing money and fans to reverberate. and to that I say  ok.
your sister is having a boy  so that means youre an uncle  right  uh  no ...wait  this whole gender thing has me confused.
with the prices of meats being so expensive now. what are the suggestions for even trying carnivor  I get beef with all the fats. but what about pork or deer  fish  beef is double the price now. hot dogs  lastly what is a typical breakfast for carnivor  could not imagine eating anything other than eggs or yogurts
lol cant wait for the mods to be flaunted to make it actually sexist lmao
there are millions of games to be found on pc. I couldn t care less if another game was ever released.
if things have to change for modern audiences then itshould be qol changes made to the gameplay so it isn t as fraustating to play as it used to be
yeah  I dont think the creepy spanish cop making pervy comments about a 15 year old girl s breasts adds a damn thing to the game  and it never did.. well  apart from maybe making me kinda laugh when sadler ripped  el puerco  to pieces and thinking that he kinda got what he deserved for being a creep..
@scott mcmahon  ashley was 20 not 15 and itshows luis character who is kinda the stereotypical smooth spanish ladies man. doesnt matter if you didn t think it added anything to the story it was originally in the game and should of remained in the game.
@creativewm_personal  its a lot of sony s stipulations on content released on their platform. the ecchI genre suffers most. almost broke senran kagura entirely..but I would say its an increasing feature of western gaming in general  not just whatever companies are based in california and london  which have considerable influence on their own .
@dying rose  man Imiss senran
@the one true nep  favorite girl
also I am a nurse. what are some good lunch box snacks. my biggest issue is eating terrible snacks...
nier automanta aka the time yoko taro said  the robots can learn feelings sentiments  but canthey learn how to deal with them    then demand the main protagonist had a giant ass booty
I didn t pickup on anything sexist in re4  ashley handled self well making her own way back to leon after evading the cultists   solving a sliding puzzle along the way. and what s this crap about awkward relationship  leon is an agent sent into central european backwater infested with parasite stricken villagers to rescue the presidents daughter.
18 game for adult audience... censored to protect adult children.I guess this will require mods to fix.
resident evil 4 is an m-rated game. and luis did not even say  boobs  he said  ballistics.  lol thats super tame. does society even know what a racist or sexist is anymore
if you wanna play it uncensored I know a few places. just sayin
honestly  Im not entirely against some of the changes. I think they wanted to change some things to discourage borderline pedo activities. I know that canonically speaking  ashley is 20 but to me  this has the same energy as final fight s poison where during the localization process they didn t want to  promote violence against women  so instead of changing how poison looked  they just said she was a dude. yes  ashley is officially 20 but does the game actually support this  I dont think so. ashley  to me  looks like she s 14  15  or 16. youre able to reasonably guess that leon is in his mid-late 20 s because re2 is a thing and even if re2 didn t exist  the way leon carries himself and talks implies that this isn t his first rodeo. ashley on the other hand  is clearly younger than everyone and acts like a teenage girl. she doesnt look or act her age  so of course people are going to think she s underage. I think some of the changes in re4vr were made to suit that end.
you could in fact never look up a young woman s  skirt  since ashley is was and forever will be a collection of polygons and not a young woman. besides that I agree with the censorship  Im ok with people enjoying depictions of horrific experiments  mutilations and mass murder of humans as long as no one is being sexist! or worse..flirting! because women are strong and better than men in every way  they need constant coddling!  or something.. this being the internet Im pointing out that whole sentence was sarcasm  that remake director and whoever wrote that article are both so sanctimonious.maybe they could get off their horses and help some real people with real life problem instead if they want to feel like they are making a difference
they should not bother making re4 vr just leave re4 alone already.. damn capcom.
how are you feeling about elon musk owning twitter
what ! no one favorite turtle was raphael! is this real life  what is going on here
oh so decapitation   ok  but panty shots   bad  smh.
we cant hear the videos you watch  you should contact some other youtubers to help you fix that!
removing things from the game makes me not buy the game. I still have my game cube and ps2 versions of the game
blood  gore  mutilation   violence. thats good.panties. oh my Lord the horrors!
night club hair
God I love your hair
go aunt boom
re4 still got it on gamecube and my kids will play itso this wont make a difference lmao
censorship is wrong especially when youre screwing with a previously existing product.
melonie mac s new hair style is hotter than ashley graham s  ballistics.  change my mind.
personaly I think people think too much into it. censorship doesnt stop any sort of real life violence  so why bother this is game 18  if I remember correctly where u blow heads up but a bit of skirt action  nope thats sexist  apparently !
what in the good golly gosh are you even talking about
weird take to be having   what you think she looks like doesnt change the fact thatshes 20.and really  shes a young youthful adult  are they suppose to look wrinkled now
@cyborg647  obviously not expecting a 20 year old to look... well  old. thatsaid  she literally looks like a child. plus  Im not sure you want to use the same argument  as those who defend lolI s. to me  thats the weird take.
the problem with censorship is that it always seems that the bar is not low enough.
its not really a new hair style. its actually a lack of hair style. just the way her hair is naturally without doing anything to it. its still hot and I like it a lot but does that change your mind that its not new
@justnobodybutme  nope.
I dont think these woke clowns know what  sexist  actually means.
congrrats!
everytime I read  for a modern audience   I am out
why are libs so afraid of the female form and people flirting
boom!!
I already got this game on ps2 with all of the content included free of all sjw tampering  what are they going to do  break down my door and confiscate my gaming collection only to replace it with copies of last of us part 2
I should go carnivore but my income would be...setting traps for deer hoping to get help with it because I cant buy lotsa good meat and Im addifted to everything sugar and carb. xd
if it doesnt matter  then why change it in the first place lefty
I hope this flops. censorship is not okay. they say its just little changes but the slippery slope is real.
good to know I wont be buying that
when r u going 2b live on twitch again
doesnt bother me! I have resident evil4  wiI edition! so Im not one of those people who needs infinite ports or remasters remakes.
yeah  well just had a look at some of the details that were changed or deleted... what can I say to that  strait out  its bs. its just laughable. and this is just another example of the many idiotic changes that went by and will likely come ahead.imagine a world where you are supposed to make an interesting movie  game or even a novel  where whether the  rough-edged  sidekick  the protagonist itself or even the most  badass  antagonist cant say or do anything that might remotely be considered sexually provocative suggestive or simply rude or bad to anyone at any point. you know what you ll end up with  a dull story  dull characters  and a dull experience that no one will buy. simple as that.the exploration of the depths of the human soul in a playful way  it one of the main reasons authors ever started writing stories and novels  brought drama to the stages and later on into the cinemas  tv s and our beloved gaming pc s and consoles. what would they all be without drama  friction of characters  deception  sex  romance  brutality and all the other intense emotions surrounding us unbelievable...
Im sick and tired of these woke feminist political pandering and censorship.Im just going to play retro games that I enjoyed by devs freedom to creat great games and games I have missed out on. I refuse support their insert or censored here products.congratulations becoming an aunt
.. the disrespect for the classics. now wonder a lot of modern games suck...
how is the left  not  like a religious fundamentalist  no...really...thats not a riddle  thats an actual question.
a little innuendo is a no no square. cooties! ewwww!!but are we sure its a woman  what is a woman anyway
modern audience  is a total cop out. also  michelangelo was better than raphael.
what was sexist about it
so they re removing a line that established that luis sera is a pervert  and defending it with sjw logic.  with the times...  what a fuckin  joke...good thing Im not going to play it anyway...its vr.
but they aren t biologists...
probably. thats what they d want to do  no doubt.
why you think the push to digital
I never like spending money on something I dont have. Imuch prefer getting hard copies. I can always reload it if something corupts the digital files.
@dying rose  even then they cant just revoke access to digital content you paid for  thats a lawsuit waiting to happen.
anything involve western its going to be boring and ruined why western people are so entitle
hi!
this is so dumb. its an m rated game isn t it  why would it need censorship  also why are they remaking this for  new audiences  your main audience is people with nostalgia and super fans.... there have already been several remakes of this game already... why does this one need to change
what a pathetic stretch of a virtue signal. nobody should want anything to do with a company as desperate as armature.  you dont edit poetry .
ha! gay!!
who fucking cares lol just be glad they made a vr version of re4. we already seen the cutscenes and dialogues several times anyways
