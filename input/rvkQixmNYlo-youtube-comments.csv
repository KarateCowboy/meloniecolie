the award for  show demonstrating everything wrong with today s society  goes to... she-hulk!
that just tells you all you need to know about award shows like these
she hulk is definitely going to win.  they played the politics exactly the way hollywood would want and it will be their middle finger to everyone who refused to be told how great this show is.
they truly deserve the awards they give themselves.
Im not surprised that this  show  got nominated for something.  also wouldn t be surprised if it won  just because I can see the awards committee screwing the system over and making the decision based on political motivations.melonie  you look amazing.
10 10 for the costume  mel! its astounding that you look closer to death than the woman playing her in the sandman. as for she-hulk  its honestly a wonder why they re surprised no one cares about award shows anymore.
jamila jamil is the titania character in the show. she is not acting  she cant   she is actually like that in real life.
death of the endless is my all-time favorite comic book character. that is a badass costume.
Im so sick of everything being rigged  so much damn corruption. I remember when most things were innocent and pure  and awards went to the shows and creators that actually deserved it. I want to go back to that time.
Im sure her fans are thrilled for her success.  both of them.
I cant wait for this show to win more awards than better call saul
you look amazing mel. this is proof that these award things are rigged in some form. the only way a show this awful gets nominated for any award is if someone paid or knew someone doing the awards
what award  having the most hypocrisy in a show s  message
awesome  death  costume from  sandman  melonie. happy halloween everyone.
you look a hell of a lot closer to the original comic than any on screen interpretation I have seen to date. good job! gold
she hulk may as well be the tlou2 of the tv industry  the one you believe does not deserve any awards period  but somehow gets awards.also  you look really pretty melonie!
I remember in college for a communications class we learned how one of the big award shows  may have been the emmys  oscars or the like  had nothing to with how good a movie actually was  but how much they basically bribed a panel of judges to nominate them for best picture.  wouldn t be surprised if this was a similar case.
I saw your halloween costume posts on twitter and wow! you look phenomenal. I also thought to myself   even on halloween  cosplayers do it better than hollywood  because your death way more accurate than the netflix version.
if we ve learned anything from hollywood  its dont trust critics or awards. only the voice of the fans matter
show was said to be attacking fans by writers yet it got nominated. who picks the shows  awards are literally handed out for just filming trash cans now of days. sad to see. thanks for the info and video melanie!
people s choice  is like how brandon wonthe position.
@norman readdis  installed... like a broken down toilet.
@otterloopb just like how tloutoo won goty and anita sharkeesian won an undeserving award.

Ive seen moon knight  she-hulk  stranger things  and obi-wan. I just heard house of dragons is really good. stranger things is definitely the best by a long shot among what Ive seen in that list. she-hulk should only win  worst of  categories.
@chris collins  hollywood has totally dropped the ball when they folded to wokism activism. the overall level of hollywood productions can now be categorized as  shite  in my opinion  with some exceptions thatstill have some remanence of quality  or are even shittier than  shite  . and its no wonder that audiences are now looking outside of hollywood for better entertainment. nordic and asian movies and series are seriously on the rise in popularity  as those still give the audiences what they want  nordic productions seem te specialize in serious  more grounded in reality storylines and plots whereas asian productions seem to be more comfortable with much lighter  more fantasy-based action.
I havent watch a show like this  award shows  since kidz countdown on nickelodeon. when I was a child. I find it amazing that individuals in hollywood  require more praise within award that they re not already getting by being a celebrity. holly wood is pathetic. and by contrast america s pathetic as well. we just happen to be lucky to be on a planet with a bunch of cowards like russia and china who see our weakness as it is right now and dont do anything about it.
gutfeld isn t in best late night even if its  people s  choice.. love him or hate him he has the numbers over all of the people nominated  I dont even think bill maher is on the list for talk shows  p  basically its just woke people patting themselves on the back.  p
@ground hog  sounds about right...
I actually think they would give it to rings of power lol
the gestures are pathetic. they insult people who aren t watching and spite people who aren t listening and then pat themselves on the back   thatsure showed them!  absolute clownery.
spot on  its nothing but hollywood sucking up to itself by awarding the either worst show or the most degenerate show....
agreed
how much money you wanna bet marvel had to pay in order to make this award bullshit happen  because thatshow is garbage.
I expect amazon will out bid everyone on paying for lotr to win
yeah  definitely politics was involved. marvel also got a ton of noms in the movie categories  for thor 4 and strange 2  lol. and take a look at the late night noms. 8 possible spots  but still the most viewed late night host didn t make it in- fox news  greg gutfeld. instead there s people like colbert  corden  and kimmel  who are all considered past their prime.
you must ve had more than just a shot of whisky.
guaranteed that disney is pressuring peoples choice because of the titania actress  outburst. gotta make it look half legit at least
@jesse  ...because Im not surprised by this news sorry to burst your bubble  but cannibalism doesnt give someone psychic powers.
@jesse  and if you think she-hulk got nominated legitimately you must ve had the entire fucking brewery!
to anyone who doubts the op  name one good show or movie that won an award in the last ten years... we ll wait.
@diogenes dworkinson  its last of us part 2 all over again.
@ninja07keaton  lmao... dont get me started on that dumpster fire!
@ninja07keaton  people care too much for goty and honestly again with as many people as Ive met and argued with no one has provided solid proof they rigged that or made fake reviews. we need more than  its just obivious.  cmon. and honestly Ive met many many people who actually love that game believe it or not and no they aren t super woke.
@diogenes dworkinson  it wasn t a dumpster fire it was more like people took a light and fanned the flames. the game was barely the wokest thing Ive seen in a long time. it was at least more subtle than others and people harp on abby s design way too much for their own good its not a proper criticism there are other things to point out. I barely felt there was an agenda being forced Imean it had some things and neil druckmann is a woke weirdo I think but its really not that terrible. and yet people speak of it like its the devil. I want those people to play ride to hell or read a modern marvel comic and tell me what is and what isn t awfully woke. or an awful game.
@chandler burse  okay bro  you do you. the entire game was basically just taking a giant shit on the legacy of the first game and all the fans thereof  but you do you. Im going to stick to real games  so its no skin off my ass either way. however  anyone with any common sense can recognize a dumpster fire when they see one  and regardless of whatever you have to say about abby  the story was trash. you seem like the kind of guy who would be going on about black elves and how all the fans are racist while we re just trying to point out the actual issues  but keep hiding behind abby. why not  its really the only defense you have.
@diogenes dworkinson  all I am saying is people who critique the game are too biased and hateful to properly do it. they care too much for abby s design and other things that aren t even an issue. and people tell me one thing I hear another. I dont give much of a crap for either games stories I never got why people praised tlou1 so much its good but its not a masterpiece its story is legit a story a game a year before did the walking dead with the adopted father and daughte sthick. its presented well I guess. and honestly how does it crap on the legacy  because it kills joel  some people praise it for its gritty realism that not everyone gets a happy ending I find it weird people critique games for a lack of realism but people cry about joel because they dont want their favorite man s man to die the way he did. people die horribly especially in tragic worlds like that and even ours. despite doing grand things. Imean real historic heroes have died in less fitting ways before. Imean even the mythical cultures reference this achille s heel afterall.
@diogenes dworkinson  I have more defenses if you like to try.
@diogenes dworkinson  I feel also your just kind of saying  its objectively bad and people are idiots if they enjoy it  which is just the most basic generic gamer thing to do. I am just so tired of gamers whining about people liking things they dont and tlou2 is too much of an example both sides treated the issue too toxically. and it just got out of hand. the game doesnt deserve the controversy  the game doesnt deserve the heavy praise either maybe  the game doesnt deserve the heavy hate I feel. its decent even good at times. its replayable Ive played at least three times now the same as the first. but its not perfect and its not the worse there have been worse and will continue to be worse. and honestly talking of disappointing sequels dying light 2 was that for me.
@diogenes dworkinson  yes I am totally just calling everyone who critiques this game racist ugh God come up with a new insult for once people. legit the people I am referring to do nothing but talk about how woke the game is and try very little to point out real issues or prove how woke it is. I ask and I get no answer. and when I do they point out stuff that is very minor. it just feels like gamers dont know how to get over subtle messages. you do know games have had this stuff for awhile now. bioshock was anti-capitalist in some form  metal gear was anti-war and had praise for cuban revolutionaries Imean its just odd. one may do it better than the other sure but the fact its there doesnt make it bad. its how its presented.
@diogenes dworkinson  I didn t say anyone was but people do and are and its not just liking it the game its also disliking it. people dont take opinions as subjective anymore itseems.
@diogenes dworkinson  I never called any of you bigots I said people focus too much on abby and other things. thats not the same. I never insulted anyone as bigots I am saying people are too hyperfocused on seeing wokeness they dont critique it well.
@diogenes dworkinson  it was playable  it had an end goal. it had a story. just because you dont like it doesnt dictate it as a non game. you wanna see a game that isn t a game  play big rigs supposedly released as finished but the game is either a joke or some scam or maybe a front for a mafia I dont know why that was made.
@diogenes dworkinson  your accusing me of hiding behind abby but your really padding your argument with insults and basic elementary school bullying. your kind of fitting the stereotype haters of the game right now perfectly while also trying to defend yourself as not one of them. jeez.
@chandler burse  look  if you want to get triggered over your button mashing cutscene generator that always has the same disappointing end  thats one thing. however  Im not reading four comments  so how about you summarize that down to just one like a normal person...
@diogenes dworkinson  Imean if you want to see a cutscene generator you can play mgs4.
@diogenes dworkinson  people tell me to put it in one comment and then people say break it up I cant listen to all the demands at once dude lol.
whats sick is this is a people s choice  award... I think the ratings already show how the people feel. they should use a like dislike meter using actual viewer   subscriber metrics...
she s everything wrong with modern women  she s now whining about elon but has too big of an ego to go away
first saw her on impractical jokers  yep this is her  she s just playing her character. if this her in real life the people around her must be equally as insufferable.
@todd taylor  not a lot of people stay around her for long. even on set of this show she was  problematic
she was the worst part of the good place.
sadly people think that is acting. its the same with ryan reynolds as well. people say he s the perfect deadpool. when he s literally just playing himself cosplaying as deadpool. people find those who dont act and are just playing themselves as acting... even though its not acting.
I d date her.  she just like jerry.  such a phony.
@cory v  so its not in a good way then
@cory v  the difference is that reynolds knows and admits he s playing a caricature of himself and runs with it. reynolds at least has some acting chops  something that cant be said of many  new generation  actors  who aren t as much actors but activists who cant act their way out of a paper bag. .
ahh thank you!
@tj roelsma  and thats the big difference  reynolds does it because he just likes his job
@matt kugelman  he also knows deadpool is just too over-the-top to be true so he cantotally go wild because he doesnt have to take itseriously. in his case it adds to the character of deadpool  in jamil s case there simply is no redemption  you have a shitty script  shitty dialogues and an activist pretending to be an actress  enough said.
@tj roelsma  facts
@tj roelsma  yea iv noticed that idk how these new actors passed training class...they are worse than b movie actors...
@jack straw  they re not actors actresses  they re activists whose only quality is that they can flawlessly spout the propaganda  which is all that counts these days. in a way thatsegment of the movie industry has embraced the old ussr mentality  party and propaganda is always preferred over quality or competence.
I indeedly agree with you
we live in a dystopian world of entertainment really. either you  consume  it or youre branded as a  blank ist.
sums it up brilliantly
cries inside
or breaking bad
if that would to happen  I would lose all hope. better call saul is actually one of the greatest shows of all time  she hulk is by far one of the worst
anyone know when season 6 is on netflix
its called the people s choice awards. are you serious
@charles nkembe  then can you logically explain how these  people  who clearly didn t watch the show  otherwise it would ve been a massive success instead of a floppy failure  nominate for a show they didn t watch but somehow still like it  they bought the nomination or sometime the awards should their bugget allows them just to have something to brag about  or in this case to save faces
@duy son  I want you to see how logically insane you sound like right now
@charles nkembe  oh do enlighten me please
@duy son  they clearly didn t see the show. how was or is that clear
@charles nkembe  oh Im sorry  in my mind  people choice award should be the people choice  right  so should a show nominated to be the people choice  at least thatshow should be watched by a majority of people  right  or just because its a show  its automatically nominated  then the nomination is just simply worthless
lol I d ask what people nominated she-hulk but its a given. can we just give the award to mel for being awesome and having a believable costume
I thought people awards depend on viewership in some way right  then how is she hulk here  like literally it wasn t even in top 10 for weeks except maybe only twice lol
all of these hollywood award shows dont take  the people  into account at all.  they re sole purpose is to push certain shows actors they want to do well.
there is an award for the worst show worst acting  I think amber heard was pick that  storytelling
and the razzy goes to she hulk
bravo
the people s choice award. like you dont need to vote on that kinda stuff. there is a reason why a blockbuster is called that way... coz people wanted to watch itso badly that they were cueing around the block. you dont need to vote on it  you can just see with your own eyes what the people s choice is. but its hollywood and hollywood is gonna hollywood.
it wins that by a mile
she hulk  goes full karen and has her series finale rewritten because she s afraid of accountability.also she hulk  everyone else must be held accountable for their actions.
@james goodman  yeah everyone else also fans
@james goodman  yeah its amazing that the show went out of its way to show us that every bad thing that happened to her was her own doing while also telling us that it wasn t her fault.they re completely blind to irony
I read  message  in critical drinker reverb.
agreed!! happy halloween
now  Im curious if melonie liked the netflix version of sandman or not. while morpheus himself was great  I found it a bit too on-the-nose woke and last three episodes put me to sleep. also melonie here looks so much like death from the comics  its kinda impressive.
@anastasia drozdova  couldn t watch it visual quality was bad with abusive contrast from failed hdr and so I dropped the show and started reading the comics instead
I saw her and thought  I kinda like the goth make-up.   it took me a second look to notice the ankh and realize what she was going for.  nailed it!
for real lol objectifying woman is bad but she hulk objectifying every man in the show is  harmless fun
@mr. s  now your getting it
funny how melonie doesnt even have to do much either.
@nathan b  I know  right  her current hair style is a natural fit  she has almost the perfect body type for the character  maybe just a little too fit athletic for death  but I dont feel it takes anything away from the characterization and Im sure as hell not gonna complain about someone being healthy  and she easily carries off the youthful appearance of the character. the one area she misses on is her complexion  but hey  who can blame someone for actually going out and touching grass once in a while  and thats what makeup is for  right
she hulk makes tlou2 look like a masterpiece
tlou2 at least deserved some awards. beside the story direction and the politics  the game was well made
@nightwolf-2019  in comparison tlou 2 is a masterpiece
@uchiwa madara  definitely not. it was so boring  the gameplay was dull and repetitive. maybe something for... idk  sound design  at the most. graphics were pretty standard  characters were bad  story was bad  acting was meh  etc.
@b m  Imean maybe for you. I loved the gameplay. it was literally the best part of this game for me when I played it. the execution were brutal asf. the graphics and sound were also pretty good. the story direction is really what made this game a 6 10.
@b m  exactly  people are so quick to compliment good graphics  at this stage in the gaming industry  thats how graphics should be by default.
@uchiwa madara  graphics and sound were pretty much industry standard  not a negative  but certainly not award winning. gameplay was honestly kinda  shallow  again largely industry standardtake away the manufactured controversy and tlou2 is just forgettable. the only thing that made the original stand out was its story  the sequel was essentially the same game but with a terrible storyif thats  award winning .... yeah  the awards aren t worth much
@uchiwa madara  if thats the case you must not play many games bc tlou2 is straight garbage
@uchiwa madara  the executions aren t gameplay  its an animation sequence that you dont interact with. most of the actual gameplay was copy paste from the first one  which is a great game  even then  nothing special in terms of gameplay . so the first game has solid gameplay and the 2nd game is like bad dlc that completely lost the entire idea behind the series. gears of war wasn t just  well received because you could brutally saw enemies in half  that doesnt really give the last of us 2 a pass.
guys I dont like tlou2 as well but comeon its graphics are atleast great still by today s standards. it deserves some awards. agree on fact it didn t deserve goty or story or characters.
tlou2 isn t this bad.
@b m  if the gameplay was dull and repetitive then so was the first game. they are the exact same except 2 has improvements to it.
@raindrop media  thats the exact issue people compliment graphics they want good graphics to be standard quality and thats stupid games shouldn t have to adhere to perfect realistic graphics. let people make their own styles.
@b m  like all execution mechanics in games  you dont interact with the executions in manhunt you just start them and decide how brutal it is. you dont play the punisher executions in that game you just interrogate them and then force the animation to occur. most games are like that. the only I canthink of that has mostly interaction in the execution is God of war but qtes aren t much popular anymore.
@jack john  I think people crap on it too much and assume more than what was actually there. people still believe abby is trans which is false  people still believe manny is neil druckmann which is false and they dont even look similar. people still believe the game forces messages of female empowerment it never once has any dialogue where men are put down and women are brought up.
@chandler burse  there are moments like that for example the father of the baby  dont remember his name. they treated his character so badly. however for female characters  it doesnt happen. like let s be honest  the game has agendas written on it but I think I would have been okay if the story was actually good not generic
@jack john  jesse despite his death wasn t treated horribly I admit he needed more time to develop. he probably shouldn t have died so quick.
@jack john  many female characters die horribly  mel gets killed while pregnant alongside seeing her boyfriend who cheated on her get killed too. nora gets beaten to death and ends up giving up her friends location.its just this game is not overtly filled with agenda forcing issues like those of some newer marvel comics or shows like she hulk or supergirl did.it also doesnt feel modern  even zombieland which its apocalypse happened in 2011 or something it has a line in the second one where that hispanic dude rags on elvis for stealing from the black man  researching this brings up the fact elvis didn t do it his manager may have but whatever  thats worse than any of the dialogue in tlou2 to me.
@chandler burse  I felt they didn t care as much when abby offed him lol. it felt like  how could you  oh yeah what happened   kind of thing.. its disappointing because compare that to tlou1  the brothers scene. it lasted longer and felt genuine. in tlou2  its as if they didn t care
@jack john  na tlou2 is pure woke trash
@chandler burse  mel was literally the stupidest character  like why a pregnant woman goes to the frontlines  nora  ellie did it  not that big and actually was cheering ellie lolyeah I agree its not like she hulkit has its good moments not gonna lie but the story was just so generic. like literally they took  naruto pain arc  lol. I dont know if you watch anime but it literally has the same themes basically
@jack john  people say they didn t care when joel died but they did.
@jack john  I just dont think tlou1 deserves the praise it gets sometimes. both games are on almost the same level their best appeal is their somewhat fun gameplay and interesting collectibles and world. but their stories are alright their characters are good but too many fanboys and girls acted like joel was real and get so uppity over his death and how they even allowed abby to exist at all in 2. joel was I guess the best written one maybe  but at the end of the day I cant help but see tlou as one of nd s finest but not their best  and its on the same level as twd telltale except I think lee is a better character than joel he is more likeable due to the lack of ambiguity of his more worse actions of course.
@chandler burse  if we are comparing twd with tlou. well thats another story. however your point isn t valid due to one simple fact. what was the thing that people loved in the first game  the evolution of joel s character from someone who lost all hope to someone who has hope and joy now just because he found ellie. his character is compelling and had a lot of character development. the relationship also with ellie was one of the best things. it inspired alot of games. for tlou2  to just introduce a character from nowhere  does it and even expects the player to accept playing with her  its totally understandable why people didn t like her. you even see videos of them purposely losing against ellie s boss fight because that was just a step too far. her character isn t as compelling and didn t absorb right. one of my biggest criticisms actually is why didn t they make a game with abby or even dlc to introduce her before any of this and make us play with her there to maybe make us like her then twist it to what happened. many may have accepted it more. as in keep her interesting. but as I said tlou2 lost all its charm especially when it introduced so many badly written characters and such a generic plot  you can find in animes of all places. hence why people until now are making fun of the fact that if they make season 2 of the series as the part 2  they make memes out of it already to show how badly people didn t like it. all I can say is joel s character was more loved by people than ellie s tbh. you can have your opinion with twd thing but as standing right now. joel was is the best character in tlou universe until now because he went through alot. ellie did too however as I have explained not in a good way lol
@jack john  its compelling I guess but I feel its been done enough even before. and done better.
@jack john  even if they had introduced her before I dont believe most of the people who hated her in the game and still did after would ve liked her. most hated her for killing joel. people hated ellie for her ungratefulness and so on.
@jack john  its also not like there aren t people who actually think joel was a bad person. the games are morally grey and my biggest issue with joel fans are the fact they cannot accept he was a gray character he was never a hero. the sequel isn t as bad as I was told. people bullcrapped the leaks too much I expected so much worse. the last thing is is woke I feel it may be poorly done in some areas. but it isn t woke. and I am tired of pretending tlou is the greatest story game ever anyways. it was compelling I guess. but it just doesnt reasonate with me as well as other games have like metal gear and red dead.
@jack john  the entire thing is subjective but people insist on it being objective and I hate the tlou fanbase for its heavy infighting during the second s release and the heavy force of objectivism. the games are whatever  I replay them maybe I have some issues of my own to work out to see them differently but I cannot for the life of me praise them both highly especially the first. I kind of had a complex where I disliked newer nd games because they abandoned jak and daxter for uc and tlou. now I love uc even 4 its my favorite even. but tlou I cant put it above uc or jak or crash especially not crash.
@jack john  just honestly I am in the bad mindset of screw everyone and their likes and biases  I am just not in a good place so sorry if I sound a bit odd and aggressive. I guess I just need to vent and Ive always held less negative views of tlou2 and not high views of 1.
@chandler burse  well I could see your point but I think maybe your not putting tlou1 as high as some fans did  helped you with accepting the flaws of tlou2 more. maybe thats just an assumption. itstill has woke elements to it though. for me I agree its not as high as metal gear for example. red dead  I dont know  didn t think about it I guess  but I would put tlou1 as high as the top 5 best stories if I would put a guess. uncharted actually would put u2 as the best then u4. I dont know if youremember this but 2011 was maybe the golden year of gaming basically. u2  skyrium and batman ac. so it may seem a little bias of me to say this but I enjoyed u2 more. naughty dog has been weird lately tbh. like uncharted the lost legacy was so forgettable to me lol. dont want them to do anything with uncharted again. the story ended and thats it. no need to keep going at it. they should do a new ip but they are sticking with tlou apparently which to me is a bad idea. as for jak and dexter  yeah sorry about that but I think maybe insomniac should continue that  they seem to be more as love project kind of team. until now nothing seems wrong or weird about them. finally its all good  maybe tone down with the comments though lol
@jack john  its not really simple for me to just tone it down. I write something first then think about it later. I get too pissed off at people lately. I also have a burning love hate relationship with gamers as a whole. I think a lot of them act like manchildren and are too entitled. and I honestly despite being a gamer cannot really say I have a lot of empathy with the whole sob stories some give about how they loved this  insert random popular series here  and now its  insert either woke agenda or its just not as good as the good ole days of 2001  and I am just tired of it. I suppose forcing my own views and expression isn t helpful either but people dont really grow and learn and honestly antI sjws are no different than sjws both are annoying  persistence and downright toxic.I also may be blinded by nostalgia but I have too many issues with those who are also blinded by it. as someone who has tried to relive it. its just not satisfying. no game as grand as when you first played it admittedly well sometimes the second playthrough can be better I guess. but we all get bored by things eventually.
@jack john  I really dont think jak will come back and I dont really care as much as I use to. I am not even a huge fan as I use to believe that was an old mindset I had. Ive never beaten any jak game outside of 3. I was just one of those kids who loved the black sheep of the trilogy. still do sometimes.
@chandler burse  you know I get you getting annoyed by  woke  or  not  but unfortunately this year and last year were so apparent about it that at this point  it became you know for real. no1 cared about a movie being woke in 2019. but in 2021 and 2022  it is just pushed way too much in your face that it became annoying to the point of  woke  became way too much. so you could see it as annoying to call many things like that but it needs to be addressed or you wont get anything new or different anymore. and agendas these days are either  men are useless  women are misunderstood or good  or  hey I am not inserts personal preference . why would I need to know that  the old days  no1 and Imean no1 said any of that. and the whole women didn t get main roles or be strong in the old days is a load of __. aliens prove them wrong  alot of movies even like wonder woman prove them wrong. and them targeting male audiences like that is getting annoying to the point of  yeah yeah I get it  you are perfect eventhough you are a human like me essentially . so people address it however you have the  woke  side saying  well they used it too much so it became irrelevant  when we all know thats not the case at all. antI sjws are annoying as well gotta admit but compared to the other side  yeah thats not called a good side either. you try to be neutral but if they keep this up  you are bound to address it and when you do  they seem to want to label you something for no reason. I get what you said about being pissed off  I actually was like that. now I just either give points to see if I am talking with someone with a  side  or not to be sure I am talking with a reliable person. if its not  then I just began to talk with logic to make them stop talking essentially because ironically they think talking last makes them win the talk lol
@jack john  I use to be really hateful of woke stuff. but now I cant really help but dislike both sides in the argument. its the same reason I cannot stand either the far left or far right.
same here
thank you so much
I looked up the reviews of a movie today that hasn t come out yet then remembered this same thing  the critics cant be trusted.even many of the  fans  with online platforms are sent by them
not always  I strongly disagree with the last of us stan s calling the second game a masterpiece. fans can be just as biased as critics
congratulations you have won a prize. send a dm to the telegram above to claim prize.
I love the dog dragging his ass at the end of the video. he s expressing how he feels about those nominations lmao

may not be the 1st of april  but let s be real... this is the perfect horror story for halloween...
great death costume. maybe if gaiman had cast you to play the part sandman might already be picked up for a season 2.
yeah she got nominated for best female lawyer of the year
the idea of rop or she hulk getting a nomination is hilarious. Im with you on house of the dragon  I lost interest in the first episode too. I d much rather watch melonies dogs playing than any of those shows lol.
your death cosplay looks better than the netflix one.
I wouldn t feel bad about not knowing who these people are. I know even fewer than you do. of all the shows nominated  house of the dragon is the only one I d seriously consider watching  I love got  incest  as a dramatic device  and all . social star of the year  what  they ll give awards for anything these days.you totally nailed the death costume by the way.
I gave my 25 votes to moon knight. I really loved the show and it would be cool if marvel realizes their more classic approaching stuff wins over she-woke.
was it the best female lawyer who did no law award edit  holy your death costume is so on point!!! sandman 10 10
love the death costume melonie
congratulations to the people who work at the people s choice awards on their sudden windfall! may they spend that money well.
we are in a time of horrible shows aren t we.side note  great costume  you look awesome.
ngl I wasn t a fan of the casting of death in netflix s the sandman but I love your rendition of death so much  mel ! amazing job!
didn t  emily in paris  got nominated for several awards aswell   I think itsays everything on the matter.
yeah  I saw that  I was also suspicious about the noms for the kenobI show  for not just best scifI but also best show  and ewan for best tv actor  and rings of power. I was sure disney and amazon bought those noms. plus in best movie both the big marvel films from this year were nominated- thor 4 and dr strange 2.
we live in times of given away  participation medals  for everyone. Im not surprised.
yeah  but its also a people s choice award  which in terms of actual accolades is the equivalent to when a student is labelled  most likely to  insert phrase or cliche here   in a high school yearbook.edit  forgot to mention  amazing costume  melonie.
I cant believe this show is up for an award. unless it was up for worst sitcom. my goodness  this show was just a waste of time. the only good part was daredevil and they made that bad. I agree about g.o.t. I wasn t a fan. one episode and I was done with got. lol I knew you would choose blackpink. love it. loved the video melonie. happy halloween. and have a good day.
Im just amused that I learned about a japanese voice actor s extramarital affairs via an article under the she-hulk one from your video lol! the guy has very important roles in video games and anime  and the lady writer he was having an affair with didn t know he was married! oh man  griffith  rohan  cloud  they really are lady killers
a white girl to play a white comic character  how dare you !
@colored fart  yeah I know right
boom!
single female lawyer!
that award should go to johnny depp s lawyer.
her dogs have more acting talent than the casts of she hulk and rings of karen...   power.
you dont watch hotd  well thats your loss I guess.
definitely rigged
jeebus! wow. how did she-hulk even get nominated  I couldn t even finish the series. I jumped off that wagon after five episodes. I agree with you on got. I thought there was too much sex between family members. they could have eluded to what was going on  without showing it. I have had people tell me that I should watch the whole series  and thats a nope from me.
perfect death costume accurate to the comics
I nominate shehulk as most eye bruising show of alll time
shout to @meloniemac for her  death  costume. brilliant choice for having the perfect built for the character.
the award for  doing what we ve done for the last 100 years  by giving fans what they want ..which is to be shit on and destroying what they love  goes to  . she-hulk!!!!
its not april fools  its halloween... well. halloween is supposed to be scary
if strange things or even house of the dragon dont win with a landslide against those disney failures then I know this world is truly lost
yes we need better stuff then what the msm pushes on us....I find its the local bands  artists  and people around me  which is the better stuff. so glad to finish my night with the real melonie mac here. I hope you had a great halloween!
rings of power and obI wan where also nominated in that category along with every other show that came out this year. all the nomination categories are like that.
the fact thatshe-hulk  la brea  obi-wan kenobI  and rings of power are even being mentioned for an award is beyond me Ive watched all four shows except for rop  and I genuinely want those hours of my life back lol
dear mel  perfect costume. perfect aesthetic. especially when compared to netflix s offering
you had a hard time choosing because everybody got nominated the same way as shehulk.
epic costume. one of my favorite characters from any series.
the pup in the background at 10 24. thats how we all feel about the nominations little homie.
the show got an award  thats not a joke thats terrifying
thats mad funny  especially because jen got lawyer of the year for doing nothing  and she-hulk also got a nominee for the show just like the meta story itself was!
this is super funny. I thought it was halloween not april fools. though to be honest she-hul getting nominated for people s choice is the most scariest thing ever of 2022. so yeah  trick or treat. scary stuff.
anybody else remember when death had a  lawyer friendly cameo  I na marvel comics book  she showed up breifly  and we didnt get a very good look at her  but it was clearly meant to be her. amusingly she says  I have to run before that thanos creep shows up.  lol
loving the costume! happy halloween !
imagine if she hulk actually win any awards.
I had to re-watch to see shredder scooting across the carpet.10 23 this should go viral
jamil was honest from early on when she asked fans what they expected  thatshe-hulk was just a parody.
Ive not heard any of the music and the only one of those shows Ive seen is house of the dragon. it has good special effects and the acting and costumes are excellent. I can see how people wouldn t like the violence and creepy sex  though. oh wait  I did see one episode of umbrella academy this season and one or two stranger things. Imight see the rest of those two at some time.
took me a minute but when I recognized your costume I smiled keep up the great work and God bless.
this chick is more death than the show s death. major respect
1. you look amazing.2. she-hulk needs to get nominated for 5 razzie awards to balance the scales of the universe again.
if she hulk wins you know its rigged af.
me  who in the hell asked for them to be nominated for an award                fans of the show  yeah slay queen  she hulk rules.
totally nailed the death look. well done!
you cosplay of death is 100x more accurate than netflix. so insane....
its so weird to see jameela jamil like this  she used to present t4 when I was a kid  what a world
the awards dont mean anything anymore... they only nominate the few people who will gain attention to the shows while they show their main nominees -  the ones pushing what they wanna push. ps plz give me hair tips xd you ve got no frizz lol help me. your hair is so pretty
death costume on point! boom!
keep up the great work  melanie. love the dogs. got to giggling towards the end.
I hope it wins  that guarantees a second season and this dumpster fire has been keeping me warm.
has house of the dragon got nominated yet  tbh if not they deserve an award tbh.
melanie s goth cuteness is all the silver linning I need for this she-hulk award news.
this truly is terrifying lol so fitting given the day. also imagine dragons writes music for soccer moms on their way to scream at kids
I love your costume  melanie!
for album of the year  I would go with the latest korn album if that is a choice. the latest album by stabbing westward is also pretty good.
same here
personally  house of the dragon was good but some bits ... definitely could do without. but according to the books  my aunt reads   the whole inbreeding is the achilles heel that causes chaos and ruin to the family and kingdom. def bleh... but not promoted at least. last kid born on the show was deformed ...  didn t make it. Imainly like matt smith tho lol I skip the ... ya know lol. also same music taste  but more army than blink  p
ghosts new album is fire
I loved she-hulk.  episodes were really short and so badly written I realized it was supposed to be satire. once I found out it was not satire it made it even more entertaining. you look really cool though.  maybe you could try out for she-hulk season 2 as a satirical villain.  ring of power is good by the end though.
you said it best  we re really hurting for good entertainment. not surprised its nominated by a group that is as woke and crazy as this show.btw you look good melonie  but is that really a costume
you look fabulous as a goth girl !
nobody should be outraged those poor people who put all that work into this show absolutely deserve their participation trophy thats what the award is
nominated for every razzie award category!
love the death costume  melonie. beautiful
argh. just this weekend a news story came across one of my feed s where some show was not going to be nominated for anything because the company making the show either had refused to pay the  entry fee  to get on the lists  or had missed the deadline.  it was unclear  and frankly the the feed s where it probably came from are feed s that are the epitome of the ashley brilliant witticism  their information is entirely unreliable but absolutely fascinating.  I wonder if this is another example of the  pay to be nominated  problem of awards shows
itsounds like disney is working overtime to make this show look good
the special olympics equivalent to an award  cool. also  love your dress-up! black is my favorite!
I need more goth melonie in my life
nominated for best cringe wokefest 2022
now thats a dope death cosplay
I really dig the goth melonie look  d we should have halloween more often xd
Im officially giving the golden toilet paper award to she hulk.
happy  belated  halloween. I was just thinking the other day if you had ever cosplayed as her. perfect. thumbs up!
I am far more invested in the ongoing background dog battle in this vid than any of the shows that are up for this award.
the only award thatshow deserves is a darwin award
4 26 ok so hot d  I love that the community has settled on that name  I just hope someone interviewing matt smith asks him how he liked working on hot d just so we can see his face  is going to be the clear winner unless there is some shenanigans going on  Ive not see in myself as its not on anything Im currently paying for and I dont sub to a service just for one show but I have heard nothing but good things about it.thatsaid I think umbrella academy and moonknight are good enough to easily get second place  they both have their problems mks final big battle looked silly and ua had more than a few errors and inconsistencies  ua also had an ending  third season  that from what I cantell ticked off most fans of the show but when compared to the rest of the list its been a slow year.
mel  am I so out of touch no  its the children who are wrong.
its really not thatsurprising awards nowadays aren t given out based on merit but based on how many checkmarks the show has
yeah  I wish.I think razzies only do movies though.
she-hulk being nominated for a razzie let alone winning one would be insulting to sandra bullock. at least she won a razzie and an oscar in the same year
I dont see the goth
damn right
principal skinner.
its gotta be that participation award
Im laughing because you know more of the awards nominees choices then I do also Ive never seen game of thrones either
best franchise killer
that is pure comedy gold imo.
10 29- you can never ever go wrong with a good anime!!
you should be nominated an award for being a treasure. lol
love the death costume
I have been listening to kvelertak a lot recently.  divine chaos is also very good.  as for female vocalists  nobody comes close to tarja turunen.
melonie mac  the greatest lara croft fan in youtube history!!!halloween 2022  she dresses as a goth lady
just one thing missing in this video melonie in a clown costume  d keep it up  great videos!
thanks for reminding me how good someone could have look as death
melonie s costume looks awesome  but now part of me wishes she would dress like that every day. maybe Im just a goth at heart  but I always think black lipstick looks amazing on women.
I just found your channel today and Im loving your perspective!
she-hulk deserves the raspberry award.
cool costume
I figure you can always buy yourself a nomination
hotd the first episode was slow but it really picked up. the sibling thing is just a targaryan thing  sorta like multiple royal types  like ancient egypt and europe. its a real creepy idea of  pure seed .I absolutely am disgusted by the sibling thing but you are not supposed to like them for it.
even sitting on thatstool she s got that  not so bright look on her face lol
this is insane!happy halloween...but this is insane!!!
clicked coz death cosplay  werewolf by night deserves a nomination.
hit meup thanks for watching
if this shitshow can get nominated for an award  then I guess any show can.
those are some slim pickings in terms of nominees. a show like she-hulk could end up winning by default in a year like this one.
melonie love your death costume she is such a cool character in the sandman comics
confirmed   the fact thatshe-hulk was even nominated means   people s choice award  has nothing to do with the people s choice!
thank you for being so damn cool  haven t watched all the videos  but damn why aren t you a writer
the scariest thing that could ve happened.
the head skills in that writers room must be Godly.
the first episode of house of the dragon starts a little slow because the first episode had a lot to set up. fair call on the incest.hold my hand was from top gun maverick and contributed to the emotions they were trying to get across.
imagine watching award shows nowadays
do you still do comment section q a videos periodically  it just feels like you haven t done one in many months  so I was curious.disclaimer  I am not trying to tell you how to run your channel. simply asking a question. no strings attached.much love  melonie.
bugger she-hulk  and Im not interested in or like certain scenes of house of the dragon. so Im with you on that!btw  you look stunning melonie
you are slowly becoming one of my favorite.
award shows are not about content or achievement  they are about studios  and about clout
someone wise once asked   is this an out of date april fools joke
so  I found your youtube channel only about two weeks ago. when I worked at gamestop  it was circa 2005 ad. the sky was still pink  and dinosaurs still roam the earth back then. I only worked there a year  but despite that  I would go into game stops every couple of weeks for the rest of my life until this year  and I never knew that you were on the tv over the register. I guess I just wasn t paying attention. but I just want to say how much I appreciate the fact that you speak in actual common sense. she-hulk was absolute trash  and itshould be treated as trash.
I actually forgot the people s choice awards was a thing.
imagine they get trolled by doomcock in the same way intelligencia trolled she hulk when she accepted her reward.
the lighting gave you that real lady death look. ......I cant belive this mess is getting any sort of nomination for anything...truly a terrifying halloween.
in other words she-hulk gets a participation trophy.
award nominations are put in by the movie studios. so  makes sense.
it wasn t nominated  they straight up gave it the award!  they  hollyweird  still want to stick it to us
thanks for watching I really appreciate  message me by the name above to receive gifts .
nominated for an award  I though this was halloween not april s fool  p
death from sandman! you already have great hair for this costume! happy halloween  mel!
for some reason  I always thought she wore fingerless gloves  regardless  love the teleute outfit!
melonie in goth    melgoth    melkor   morgoth    awesome low-key Lord of the rings reference!
I think that is one of the ways this ego tripping hollywood has gotten out of control  awards given for every reason but talent. so fans dont matter anymore it is the money guys throwing good money away for their own guilty pleasures instead of our entertainment.
better looking death than netflix put together.
loving the goth look... you would think that to get a people s choice award there would have to have been people who watched it...
she-hulk should be nominated for the golden raspberry awards
you look great  melonie! happy halloween! keep up the great work!
I lost it at the end of the vid when I saw the dog drag his bum across the carpet
love the death cosplay!
I guess everyone wins a ribbon for participation
I would pick the umbrella academy. fantastic show
happy halloween! youre a natural as death!  my fave char from the sandman.
ngl when she had no idea who people like bad bunny and jack harlow were I thought  wow she really is a nerd  thats how you know you subscribed to the right channel
I honestly am just in love with your beauty but your also so very interesting and intelligent! keep up the awesome work. love your willingness to stand up againt the lies.
omg I love your death costume!!!  3
when the people giving out the awards are the same kind of people as the ones making the crap shows you get this.
all jokes aside  your makeup looks good! always love a good gothic look. nice!
your doggies at the end of the video cracked me up          costume 9.9   10    straight hair 10.
omg the way your dog walks in the background at 10 minutes 26 seconds is hilarious
Ive never voted in these things. I did this time though  just so that I can vote for a show that isn t she-hulk. also they weren t nominated for best show  they were nominated for best sci-fI fantasy show  which is a much more limited category. I voted for moon knight  which was actually a decent marvel show.
and just like that  the peoples choice award is unmasked as having absolutely nothing to do with the people.
if stranger things doesnt win I dont know what to say
you look more like the character of death then the one on netflix
in a normal world it would only get nominated for a razzie  but we know thats not the world we live in.
is this a joke  this has to be a joke!  - cait  fallout 4.
couldn t help but to notice  dave chapelle wasn t nominated
melonie looks 1000x more like death than the netflix version.
I didn t notice the dog rubbing his ass on the carpet first time I watched this
this channel and overLord dvd are my 2 favorite channels that Ive discovered  recently!
most stunning and brave projection by a director 2022
when you find out that the nominated shows on these types of rewards are those who paid to be nominated yourealize how much of a joke this really is.
aw I was expecting to see you paint yourself  and dress up as she hulk for this video. honestly you would make a better she hulk by far. though I dont think anyone will want to be associated with that mess for a long long time.
in other words  she-hulk is getting a participation trophy.
if she hulk beats house of the dragon  you ll know for sure it was rigged.
ur death costume is so badass. ur awesome
oh this is nothing new. Im almost 60 years old  and Ive seen  how the hell did this movie show get an award  moments even in the early 70s. its always happened.
titania is one of the best acted characters on the show yet did nothing in the show. seriously what did she do for the plot.
the nominee for worst timeline goes to...welp we re screwed.
10 26
all she did was some how not get jailed when she should be
@daniel n  jen or titania   sarcastic  titania was a joke that didnt have any respect yet I found she came across better than the characters we were suppose to relate to
stunning costume!
I enjoyed obi-wan the most and yes always blackpink
its should get some nominations on the raspberry awards
I love heavy metal! sweet child of mine is my favorite!
I remember when I watched she hulk animated series. that feels better than this.
bros will probably be nominated for an oscar this year too. oscars  emmys  academy awards dont mean shit these days.
goth melonie has needs to be a thing.
the butt drag at the end! lmao
who would ve thought death would be so beautiful
what I want to know is how much do these nominations cost disney and amazon.
wow. they re actually giving thatshow a participation trophy.
if it wins  we ll know that the award is the equivalent of  female lawyer of the year.
I wonder how much it cost them to purchase that nomination
if your ankh necklace from that costume were an rpg accessory I d argue it offered maybe  10 holy protection or something cool like that. go boom.
stunning and brave.
dear netflix  see this! this is what death is supposed to look like! 100  perfect cosplay.
I dont even watch television anymore  when I did I d watch history channel  travel channel  animal planet  racing  on occasion Imight even find a good movie  almost always a older one . what I couldn t figure out was most of the time there was 100  channels of crap  how do they come up with that much crap
gosh this is a reallly good halloween scare from hollywood
I feel like most of these  nominations  are spots gained through bribes. I do like the umbrella academy though. that one deserves the nomination.
they re not making shows for us anymore. the she-hulk crew s been saying it all along. they re making shows for investors.
congratulations  you have been rewarded with a prize. send a dm to the telegram above
everyone does the cousin sibling thing nowadays. they just dont know that they re related.
I subscribed!!   edit   at the 10 00 mark  in the background  your dog is dragging its butt on the carpet.  might want to get them to a vet and checked.
the song of ice   fire books didn t glorify incest at all the way that the show did  the readers didn t even know thats what happened until stark puts the peices together at the end of the first novel. its hbo themselves that glorifies incest and general matters of sex. the show itself obviously didn t understand the overall theme messages of the story because they were very far off from sticking the landing  as far as what the dance between ice   fire stands for or the difference between tragic hero   hero-turned-villian. of course we cant expect woke writers to understand complex storylines with too much depth.
yay! props to you for dressing up like the non-woke death. you have officially become my favorite!
I wonder how much disney paid under the table to get this nomination
as a fellow iowan I have to say I love her accent
never watched got  but umbrella academy is pretty good.
cool death costume. I feel the same as you when it comes to game of thrones. I could not get in to it.
that absolutely blows my mind
peoples choice award   trophies for all
just stopped by to say I love your death cosplay!!
if hotd doesnt win Ive lost faith in humanity. stranger things was good too but was more fun and easy to watch  like u didn t have to pay attention to know what s going on. which is good cuz some people just like to relax sometimes.
nominated for a people s choice award. this award show has nothing to do with critics  the audience votes. I thought the fans are always right
awards are a joke  your halloween costume is pretty spot on  Im sure neil gaiman would agree.
I love the costume.
its kind of weird to me that jam eel that jam ill has made tits mania her entire identity. Imean  she was only playing that character for about 10  maybe 15 minutes of screen time in the entire show and it wasn t exactly a mind-blowing method acting performance. but yeah  awards shows are stupid and pointless circle jerks and the only arguable distinction that the people s choice awards have claim to is that it is instead a stupid and pointless popularity contest.
people wonder why no one believes awards ceremonies as valid anymore
she taps out at the whole siblings or cousin thing...    the fbI was extremely bored with her search history as a teen
im not sure I d brag about winning an award if thats the what was also up for it
if she-hulk being nominated is the  trick  then there better be a huge bag of skittles for the  treat  or someone s windows deserve to be soaped....
apparently the industry has finally been able to take the people s choice awards out of the hands of the people.  that will be confirmed if this show wins.
was is the  notable achievement as female woman writers of woman-ness on a supers show  award  and the twist is that every woman in the field gets it  edit  better job at a death costume than an entire television studio managed melonie. gj.
I wonder who got bigger wallets for this to happen
nice costume as death of the endless melonie!
you know girl not everybody hated  she-hulk     just saying .
love the death cosplay
this goth look is
so the people s choice awards is now giving out participation trophies.
I kinda feel like this is a pity nomination. it wouldn t surprise me if it win  but given that pretty much every contestant in thatsci-fI category is nominated in a bunch of other categories  itseems kinda self evident thatshe-hulk was just thrown in to pay lip service and not because people think its actually good. house of the dragon or stranger things are the obvious choices for me  although I hesitate to call hotd  science fiction  unless we re combining it with fantasy  and both shows are nominated for  the show of  22   so the fact she-hulk is even there and nowhere else kinda makes me feel like  they re gonna give it to the show for no other reason than to half-heartedly virtue signal while they give the other shows that are actually worthy of recognition the bigger awards.
she s only a few layers of makeup away from pulling off a good muerte november 2nd
nice death of the endless costume  you literally put in more effort to look like the character then the show did since you actually did the makeup right.
the people s choice award should be called the twitter bot aI reward lol
people s choice award but people hated it
I would pick moon knight out of that bunch  but I would imagine stranger things is going to win.
so they nominate themselves for awards from shows made for themselves. pretty clear they dont need us anymore. message received.
didn t jamilla announce she was leaving twitter after elon acquired it
I just knew you could go full on goth. she hulk for an award     a great opportunity for the show to get rick rolled
are you sure that nomination wasn t for the  peon s choice  award
look great cosplay! you should call your dogs slim and wadsworth     goldfish for the day.
I gave she hulk an incomplete because it had funny moments but I didn t know where the show was headed.
I appreciate your comment dm above to receive prize
goth death melonie gets two thumbs up from me.
I think this shows one of the reasons I stopped caring about any of the award shows
the nobel prize for twerking goes to.....
awesome costume!!!
I d love to challenge jameelia jamil to a spelling contest.I bet I d win.
hImelonie! fan of the content as always. this may be off-topic  but as Christians shouldn t we put halloween aside with the costumes or dress-ups  I would like to get your opinion on the matter. now  getting on topic  all of this is absolute madness. they are patting themselves in the back like hurray we did a fantastic job. they think they knocked out of the park  and they did... directly to the garbage bin! this award nomination is a joke lol
nice death of the endless costume
best show of the year
Im sorry  but if she-hulk wins the award for best scI fI show and the friggin  orville doesnt  after three seasons of pure fun and intrigue as opposed to she-hulk s nine episodes  then there will be no justice in this world.
death of the endless I love it!!!
loving your look  melonie mac! that inspired by death note also  that award nomination doesnt seem like as a joke  as much as itsounds kinda sus. . .
its almost like its rigged its like me nominating myself for being best in the sack and then handing myself the award but never polling any of they women lol
melanie  Im death today.me   guess Im dead.
thats a great death cosplay.
female artist of 2022- melonie mac
I dont know any of the options you were given to vote for  though I do like some of what imagine dragons have done
your costume is awesome!
disney probably paid for the nomination behind the scenes.
remember  its  trick  or treat  so we dont need april fools day to have an in poor taste prank  like she-hulk getting nominated for a people s choice award  pulled on us.
she-hulk got an award  thats spooky
the incest stuff in game of thrones wasn t so bad because it contributes to a story arch.
the fact that a show that had incest in it became the biggest show truly speaks to where we are as a society and to the not so secret perverse world of hollywoke.
this is like the monty python skit  well I didnt vote for it   its the peoples choice you dont vote for the peoples choice.
I wish I had the money. I would give it to the youtubers who actually know a thing or two about these franchises and let them make good entertainment.
melonie really pulls off the black lipstick.
also  snoop dog did a cool remix of girls bring the boys out by snsdalso also  I dont know any of most of those social media people and actively avoid bella s attempts at whatever it is. where s melonie max  jayne theory  sydney watson  jeremy quartering  jeremy geek  nerdrotic  nerdrotic s kid ryan  doomcock  et al  those are the names I recognise in social media
I agree with your dog .  here s what I think about your stupid award show   drags butt across floor
impossible. the people gave it a 33  on rotten tomatoes.
you look  ber awesome. that goth look looks so good on you.
they are really pushing to make this kind of awards completely irrelevant  aren t they
sadly when it comes to people s choice awards its mostly  who you know  to get nominations and  how much money do you have   to get your name out there for marketing to get votes.  quality has little to do with it.
10 24 and 10 39   ten points for your dog sliding in the background!
if this what the people chose  then the people are crazy!
youre dog can be seen butt scooting behind you right before the end of the video lol that was funny. also as soon as I saw blackpink on those lists  I hopped on and voted only for them! I love blackpink!
how is westworld not in this nominee list
way better death than what ever the f    netflix made
my  oh my  @melonie mac  thatsetup suits you.
I believe this is known as the  participation trophy.
awesome death costume  way more faithful than that awful netflix show.
jameela jamil really did not need another ego boost
okay  youtube. since you wont let me fucking edit my edit  I have to correct sirI s meddling autocorrect of max back to mac via reply to post. this platform  smfh
because its shit  so s she hulk but hey!
hey melonie happy halloween to you too and I like your halloween outfit. it is so cool and rad gothic outfit that you got on. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and I just wanted to tell you that I can not believe thatshe-hulk show got a award for the show. anyway I thought that it is so bad and awful show to watch after I watch it and I thought to myself that I would never watch it anymore and I hope it will not renew for another season for next year after this season 1 show is over  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that bout this video topic and I just wanted to tell you that I really like your halloween gothic outfit and I like your black lipstick too. anyway hope you had a great day today and I hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your parents and have a good night too melonie.
I dont even know why future creatives would ever want live action adaptions anymore.the arrogance of these people when it comes to adapting franchises is absolutely disgusting.
if... Imean when she hulk eventually looses they are gonna blame the fans for it mark my words
for what its worth on the um . romance aspects of house  you can skip through most of it w out missing any plot
award ceremonies are just popularity contests made to make a small percentage of people  who for some reason are the loudest  happy lmfao
I also forgot to say your outfit looks amazing choomba.
of course it got nominated for an award. the schill award of the year that is. though I thought rings of power was going to win it first lol.
they do it for their fans. all 3 of them.
all the awards committees need a woke shakedown. even nobel is under the woke spell
I did knew your channel  but now Im subbed. you look more like sandman s death than a multimilion netflix show actress
love youre death  custom.
I love the black it worksyou could pull off a black cat cosplay easy
melonie has gone goth!
I used to view people s choice as more legit because its voted on by the audiences fans compared to the political who-gives-the-most-money oscars. but either the pool of shows is so bad she-hulk actually made the cut  or this was a forced entry by disney to give creditability to the brand.
10 22 your dog showed us what they thought of these shows when they started dragging their butt across the floor lol
she hulk winning a people s choice award reminds me of that family guy episode where they go to the teen choice awards and all those goofballs are in attendance like tank top gay face  its gotta be those types of people voting for it
you look great as death endless. the goth girl look suits you.
love the lady death.
house of the dragon has got this. moonknight I enjoyed but house of the dragon has been genuinely good.  I felt obI wan  rings of power  and she hulk were just not good.
billy wilder once said  awards are like hemorrhoids. sooner or later every a.....e gets one.
looking good melonie!
oh my gosh!! the perfect death  unlike that netflix content  lol
its more of an award show of  the best shows that were still really shitty award show
stranger things is the only one worthy of nomination and deserves to win
I just want to know how much paid for that nomination  .it must have cost them a fortune  .
sandman is the best show of the year
is anyone else going to miss halloween as much as I am this sounds like a totally made up award that the nbc show will probably win since they re broadcasting the awards.
yep. you win. every time.
gothic is how do I word this  cute  pretty  no a unrelated note house of the dragon is historical accuracy.because royalty did stuff like that
how the hell is this sci-fI fantasy  seems more slice of life lol
how long has this year been  umbrella academy was in 2022  thats what happens when you watch a series in a day huh  lol. she hulk wont win and hod should. its compelling and you should give it another chance.
now thats a cool death!
this means that I can be nominated as new pope soon.
didn t know they did razzies for tv shows. good for them.
fun fact the award is in two category thatshe hulk attorney at law have not
as a filmmaker my award would be the acknowledgement and enjoyment of non-wokes  and of course the money I earned
btw the incest stuff in got is meant to be uncomfortable like many other things in the show. thats part of the appeal for us fans.
yea! I knew you were death from the sandman just by the thumbnail. you would have been better cast in the netflix series
it has to be between stranger things   house of the dragon. it cant be anything other than those. ps you look great as death
save the money from planning this event and give it hotd already
hey melonie. as a Christian  I dont celebrate halloween. in fact  I refer it by its original pagan name  samhain  pronounced sow win . but I love your death costume.
oh those gloves are cute!
bros will sweep the oscars and none of us saw it coming.
nobody carried the show. the majority of people only wanted daredevil and thats why they put him towards the end of it. to keep you subscribed.
disney is pushing strings.
it is always a bleeesss to see a rl waifu doing a great cosplay!
how is not nominated for a razzy
she hulks one fan was brought joy.great.
only award this shot deserves is every single razzie.
all I canthink is how many people vote to actually call these people s choice awards.
Im starting to think either fake people exsist  or disney demanded an award to try to get farther hype for this travesty
granted titania has more personality than shehulk.
no  no youre not out of touch for not liking a lot of stuff on those lists of nominees however  I dont think there s anything amongst the whole thing that I like  maybe Im just old in my case.
I have no doubt this is rigged. Imean  this is disney marvel we re telling about  probably the richest entertainment company in the world. no doubt they would be willing to spare money to rig an award to make the show that fans are complaining about look better
wow! I dont know what to think about humanity anymore but these news made me lose all hope!if aliens were taking over worlds only if there was no sign of sentient life... after watching she hulk or lotr they ll take over us in a second!
some interesting insight into your musical preferences  although given some of your reaction  itseems plausible that green day may have found its way onto your   likes  column.. if thats the case then just know that there will be a small passing of judgment
there s no way stranger things doesnt win
all the money they didn t spend on the show had to go somewhere
I was expecting kenobi.
aw shucks
@melonie mac go boom  omg! thank you for reading my commentliterally  how to make me happy  to be noticed by such an amazing person like yourself!thank you again!
@melonie mac go boom  also  you so deserve the praise! haha
yo wtf Ive been reading through the sandman right now  you look so dope!
despite not watching this show  I ignored it because of what I saw coming. not that I saw this part coming entirely  but I am just going to continue to ignore it. you shall have my like since I know it goes a long way. but thats it. the more we feed the troll the more it grows. kudos to you and your channel  but Im just going to keep turning a blind eye to this vile creation. and no  Im not talking about the hulk himself... Im talking about this ridiculous  show  that keeps trying to get shoved down our throats. its the only way to beat it. ratings spoke for themselves long ago. nothing else will save it.
my vote would go to moon knight
melonie you look fantastic! spooktacular
also I guess they are rebooting the inhumans as a musical.  God help us.
great vid. sorry you couldn t make it to the orlando meet up. maybe next time! btw  looking great!
I would have been shocked if she-hulk hadn t been nominated for something. its hollywood praising their favorite child and all of hollywood s sycophants bowing down in worship.
I loved she hulk
its not that youre out of touch. its just this shit is woke too.
rock  metal and k-pop  we re a team
in an observation of hollywood  the oscars were created as a self-awards events of the major studios  where they give away the guy named oscar to their favorites.  that is the key about it  it isn t a fair competition  and it isn t relevant  where the actual award is something else  and perhaps a successful movie career  and nobody is really sure of exactly why   and it is used to spotlight their favorite actors and actresses.  she hulk gets nominated for an award by disney  and this is nothing more than the virtue signalling that they are doing for bad shows.
this makes as much sense as jen winning lawyer of the year despite winning no cases in the show. no sense whatsoever
this whole she hulk fiasco is just  the last of us part 2  of hollywood.
personally I thought that house of the dragon was overrated as well. obviously hotd is a great show in comparison to other shows of thatsame genre. so far with it gangs of london is my favourite tv of all time its so good and I also prefer that kind of tv show. fringe and the strain are two of my all-time favourites as well.I have to admit I find this story very amusing . it is a lot more funny a plot than most modern comedies imo.
disney also bought out the saturn awards  and shows like boba fett  obi-wan kenobI and ms marvel all won awards. https   en.wikipedia.org wikI 47th_saturn_awards winners_and_nominees
outside of rock and metal I dont know any contemporary music outside of stuff my wife listens to
you should listen to hangover gang!!! he should get the award for independent rapper. killing all the woke clown of 2022. keep it up. melonic mac go boom!
people s choice award is rigged or something is really fishy
I didn t know any of those names either  the only thing I would vote for is stranger things.
in a show thatsucked  the character of titania was possibly the suckiest part about it.  that character was more pointless than madisynn  who was probably the best character in the whole show.
youre always such a beautiful woman
the dog at 10 20
house of the dragon was the best show of 2022 hands down. itsingle handedly destroyed rings of power and she hulk and it was probably the show that had the least amount of money spent on it. it just goes to show no matter how much money you flow into a show if the writers have 0 clue on what they are doing it will still be absolutely crap. house of the dragons had amazing cgI when it needed to be in the show  it had amazing writing  amazing actors and had an amazing cliff hanger thatsets up season 2. unfortunately she hulk had non of this and rings of power only had amazing cgI but overused it wayyy to much.
how much does this award cost
wait what ! takahiro sakuraI had a ten year affair with someone who worked on naruto! thats crazy but thats besides the point
house of the dragon and stranger things is leagues above the rest. moon knight  despite being very flawed also looks like a masterpiece compared to obiwan  shehulk and the rest lol.
I figured you d dress up as lara croft.
is the people s choice award a leg lamp  if not  then its not a major award in my book.
yeah pink venom is awsome but Im watching a lot  shut down  I think I like it more
best song. lorna shore- the pain remains.
melonie s dog dragging ass across the carpet in the background at the end was priceless. I laughed too hard. lol. thatsaid  these awards aren t going to be indicative of quality. this is an echo chamber for all the woke virtue signalers out there to tell each other how amazingly woke their products are. I wouldn t be surprised if rings of power or she-hulk wins.
I guarantee stranger things will blow everyone away
if anita sharkeesian won an award  she hulk getting a  nomination  is not a stretch.also tlou2 goty smells like kitchen nightmare. people s choice  is like how brandon wonthe position.real example of people s choice is ghost of tsushima.
happy halloween mel mac!!!!
I would say the only award this show deserves is a razzie  but those who accept them actually have the ability to take a joke and recognize when the project they did isn t very good. they are too narcissistic to even deserve a razzie.
great look for halloween mel! its a joke thatshe-hulk was even nominated for any award. the show was a disgrace and should be pulled off disney   thats awesome you listen to kpop
9 28 you look exactly like comic character!edit  if there s no ricky gervais   supernature   instead unfuny amy shumer - you know that those are wokie s choice awards that you can mention as a... bad joke  p
a razzie award would make sense.
Im really sure that they paid a lot for it
aw thank you
you look amazing!
the same people giving it a award are probably the same  professional  critics who get paid to give something a posative review.
shocking! Imean awards shows have always been known for their unimpeachable integrity  instead of pathetically shilling for a bit of cash or clout. oh wait I got that backwards
such a weird process  giving data to the bigs about incredibly wealthy people while we re sitting here in a recession day by day.  you know who is certainly going to take the time to fill this out  she hulk enthusiasts.
I feel like these weirdos have ruined almost ten years of our media in all forms that is art
you might have missed the point on the sibling activity in game of thrones. its not glorified or promoted. in fact  its used by the writers to indicate just how awful the people in question are  and they get serious hate and even punishment for it as the show goes on.in the end  its just character building thatshows just how bad those people are.in house of dragon  the show involves a noble family that believes they have magical blood and therefore they usually prefer to marry other members of their family to keep the bloodline pure. you know  just like most your european ancestors felt about their royal families in real life. icky yeah  both in the shows and in real life.luckily in game of thrones the total time thatsuch sibling activity is onscreen is about 0.001  of the runtime of the series.its even less in house of the dragon  though it is mentioned and a little pg-rated fully clothed activity happens between a couple family members. far from  gratuitous . both the tv shows are pretty good  except the last two seasons of game of thrones which are now the gold standard of how to completely ruin a popular tv show. if you could just close your eyes and get past that 0.001  you might find out that the shows are pretty good.you do you.if using that mechanic to build awful characters that you are supposed to intensely dislike is too gratuitous and you cant get past it  then the show is probably not for you.but if you can apply that dislike only to those very few characters that do it and then try to like the rest of the show  its probably worth it.
no your not out of touch  choomba. your not into pop culture just like myself I knew very few of those in those selections  and I think part of being woke is that you know all of them. plus I also call it growning up. so I wouldn t worry too much about it.
a raspberry sounds more like it. its a participation trophy award.
Imean in hollywood you only fail upwards. so this kinda makes sense since its leaning towards a political ideology. even though the series itself has terrible writing within it. lol
we re not forced to listen to the radio no more so I also haven t heard any of these
award shows have been a sham since the late 90s. as soon as the enter industry realized that they can push they re social politics through their work  the writing and creativity took a back seat. well  more like got knocked out of the car. the only hope left is small indie production companies  and diy indie films. they may not be well funded  but they have honest  and true intentions. let s just all collectively hope they dont fuck up moon knight.
if the nomination is for an awful woke show it wins a grammy for sure.
if these are the people s choice awards   the people are  eh  lletahded.
I found melonie in an interview on revenge of the cis  she s pretty based so if you like this girl youre probably gonna like these guys
10 25 your dog dragging its ass along the carpet lol
its like the big club ordeal that george carlin talked about  a bunch of rich brats just doing whatever they want.  oh yes  your stinking pile of crap is exceedingly fragrant!
I wouldn t be surprised if if was true.  the award shows are just as woke as the msm
itshould win a ignoble prize.
house of the dragon or stranger things better win  as people actually watch those.
they had to put only terrible shows to nominate because a good nominee would win by landslide
the latin artist of 2022  - that category already shows how meaningless those awards really are. no matter what latin artist will get this award  he she will get the award for being latin  not for skills and talents. if it truly were about skills and talents  instead of ethnic background  aka  race    then they would not have their own category.
terrific death costume. nailed it. omg she hulk is so awful.
if thats what death looks like im not all thatscared
the desperation just seeps off she-hulk. the shills are shilling so hard and the show runners are trying to make the show bigger than it is. I want to know who the people is behind the people s choice award. titania had such a small and insignificant part. wong had better pull.
lol anyone else notice the dog dragging its butt across the carpet at the end
bts will win everything they are listed in. fans will make duplicate accounts and spam votes. I think these  people choice  awards need to be more regulated to have any credibility.
rings of power will win easily if they have a category of most money wasted.
black lipstick really works for you
this exposes the awards system for the sham that it is. its all subjective anyway.
your hair makes this cosplay chef s kiss.
you if a big fat hot d doesnt win that category  or at least stranger things.if we re talking acting here  hot viserys paddy has to win.
titania getting nominated when she s a background villain instead of the  main protagonist  really says something about the main character  lolas for the house of the dragon  incest in a show being a big turn off is an absolutely valid reason and much better than calling your fans racist  bigoted and sexist... all I felt like saying to that was  okay its understandable  have a nice day rings of power  I stopped adding lotr to that garbage after its first episode
green representation award  I d give that to baby grogu instead.
dude... youre not suppose to have your phone out in a court room... they have this character actively recording in one...
now adults get participation trophies  too!
awards do not honour people  people honour awards. obtaining an  equal outcome  for your show doesnt make your show as good as all the ones that got the award before. it just makes the award as bad as your show.it reminds me of rings of power having glowing reviews and stellar critic ratings. cant wait for its showrunners to be awarded nobel prizes in literature.
I use to like jameela jamil  I even use to watch her show the misery index she hosts along side her co-stars of impractical jokers. now I dont feel the same way about her now after the thinks she and her co-stars and creators have said and done towards marvel fans like me and other things as well  becoming a complete turnoff fanwise and itsaddens me.
the real questions is  where is your epic rap battles   indiana jones vs lara croft  reaction
these modern awards shows are basically just a bunch of raccoons congratulating each other on all the fine scraps they ve collected from the neighborhood garbage cans. their idea of gourmet is not the same as most people s.
song of the year should be  influencer  by band-maid
Im not overly surprised at the nomination or even the high critical reviews. in the culture we live in most any reviewer that would give an honest take on how trash the show was would likely be labeled as being sexist or antI feminist. the show had some okay moments and episodes but let s be real  the writing was sub-par  the theme boiled down to  men are pigs and idiots  women rule and are just better at everything   and the visual effects were awful for something coming from the mcu. its doubtful because of how hard the social agenda is being pushed by disney  but I personally hope they just cancel any future plans for any follow-ups
if hollywood was honest the only award itshould be nominated for is a razzie
takes 3 years to piss away millions brave and stunning. have some awards...
any non razzy awards this show wins bought just shows that award is more of a joke than she hulk is.honestly cant think of any aspect of this show legitly worth praising much less being an award worthy  but it could sweep categories at the razzies.
I love your outfit. is that death of the endless
honestly  I hated house of the dragon s first few episodes  thought the acting was abyssmal by the younger cast  matt smith s squeaky voice didn t fit a ruthless asshole like daemon  but then  as soon as the young main cast was gone  it became pretty good  I was never a huge fan of game of thrones  watched all seasons wished I had stopped on season 6   know everything that will happen in dance of dragons  but I will keep watching because it got really good! and Im not woke at all  yesterday was the presidential election here in brazil  and Im dishearthened by the result  too much crap to explain in a single comment  so Im watching some videos to cool off before to deal with events that will  almost certainly  lead to a civil war  a real life one  and I intend to fight for the country that I love  well  spoke too much already  just wanna say thanks for sharing your thoughts on so many subjects and thankfully for being someone reasonable thatshares the sames principles as I do  youre a lovely woman and I do wish you greater success in life    Godspeed
and the chump award for being the most sandcastle stomping piece of work goes to shehulk! no applause just crickets.
if the  female lawyer of the year  award from the show doesnt get mentioned I will be disappointed...
I dont know if I just aged out of music or if music just really got worse.... I didn t listen to any music for probably 2 years  and now Im listening to it again but only old stuff.  I cant get into this new stuff.
I dont know man I think the date is correct cause thats some true horror right there
doesnt sound like house of dragons has any competition
they gotta have this show win an award so they can act like its not as big of a flop as it actually was
happy halloween! lovin the fit and makeup!
the only award this show deserves is a razzie
who are these people  who gave them a choice !
umbrella academy shits on everything there  house of dragon is solid  if you get hung up on incest then any realistic fantasy with royalty is out
the cgI and production for rings of power does deserve awards. the rest of if was average to me
that isn t an award this is just a self-pat on the back lol  smh
awesome death costume melonie! you look amazing!!! are they still trying to make this show a thing  Imean  besides a cringe-fest and unintentional comedy.
holy shit look at that awesome dog in the background
id watch shows before I speak about whether they are any good
the only award that garbage show deserves is the razzie award  also you are looking great as death  should have been you playing the character
and I thought I was the only one who didn t like  got    Imanaged about  4 episodes from the first  season   and despite my love of fanasty scI fI  I just didn t like it.    even the books were  meh
5 10 me too  I really cant stand it feels gross  also too much p scenes for absolutely nothing  like if itserved a purpose like in american psycho  to make it a story point about the character s narcissism etc  okay  but when its constantly here for absolutely nothing you just know its fan-service
are the razzies still a thing  they d sweep those  well maybe lose a couple to rop  but they d do really well. Ive seen people say they think she-hulk was funny  I wonder what is wrong with the brain chemistry of those people.
you sure they didn t switch april fools and halloween around
if anyone carried the show  first it was hulk  then it was wong  and then daredevil  who everyone was really waiting for . the guest appearances carried the show. jen wasn t interesting or funny  and titania wasn t either.
I get your aversion to their portrayal of incest but it kind of was historically accurate  I loved game of thrones except season 8  you would have loved jon snow and the dire wolves  the house of the dragon is decent but not awesome  it just seems great by comparison to all the crap current year.
its an award for most alienated fans in a year other contender is rings of powaaaaaa. also there appears to be some kind of small animal behind you
people s choice award.heh. heh heh. heh heh heh heh. heheheheheheheheheheheheheheheh.heh.what  people  made this choice  by the way  titania could have been a fascinating  even sympathetic villain. instead  she s transformed into a shallow  narcissistic bimbo. and they got the perfect actress to play her.by the way  youre a cool halloween goth. you have better fashion sense than that dummy in the pink tasseled thing.
dave chapell is not in comedy show of 2022 !  lol
immediately turn off the video when she said she didn t watch got  the romance  strange of even degusting as it was  was very gratuitous to the show. if youre flaky or easily triggered  which is perfectly fine  youre in the wrong profession in my humble opinion.
you know everyone here loves the show.  jerry is such a phony.  lmao.
star trek discovery was nominated for awards. Im thinking these awards are a response to backlash.
thats a fair reason to not be into house of the dragon.  that gets way worse as the season goes on.  I try not to judge based on our culture  though.  at some point  aren t we all products of incest    I dont remember reading in genesis that God created more people for the kids of adam and eve.
dont miss out on luke combs
house of the dragon is much better than got.
hotd should gracefully bow out from that one. sounds like the razzies has changed names.
the awards mean nothing anymore.
its like being able to lick your own snatch and be proud of it and get rewarded too
better call saul ended. where s the other half
the only award this show should be nominated for is the razzies.
how is this the people s choice   wouldn t this be the critics choice or is this just the new name for the razzies
she play s herself not the comic book character
this is coming from a guy who hasn t watched game of thrones  so take it with a bit of salt  whether the show was well written or not  though what I hear from the season finale would suggest it absolutely wasn t   I feel it falls flat on its face from the sheer pathetic  shocks  it tries to give people. a very large percentage of that audience wasn t watching for a story. they were watching to see who sleeps with who  how much titty they were gonna see  and how violent it got. thats all it was. also - if your writing is constantly killing  important  characters  then youre robbing yourself of your own shock because people will learn to expect it. for me  the whole thing was way over hyped and ruined before I could even watch it. Ive tried watching some snippets. it looks pretty terrible.
someone s a fan of sandman.  d
the only award that crap deserves is razzie
this is the last of us 2 again  a game nearly universally disliked yet treated as great simply out of spite and a desperate attempt to create the facade that its good.
makes me thing of  jims big ego s award show
the cyberpunk edgerunners anime has been the only great production in any medium that has come out for some time. it was amazing  emotion evocing  it was true art. marvel creates nothing but trash. stinky hot trash. if you dont believe me  just watch the new black panther trailer.
win or lose she hulk probably be blaming on trolling
can only ask who are most of these people who are being nominated
nice death costume but where s the hat and umbrella
love your costume
10 23 you may want to clean your carpet.
wow! you look just like death herself.
if stranger things doesnt win then the whole system if rigged
love you mel  stay gothic  sorry  gorgeous!
you could ve said  go boo  at the end of your video. but then again thats a dad joke on your signature sign out. happy halloween everyone!
Im gonna take a while guess here but Im assuming most people is not comfortable with brother sister game of thrones style interaction. but thats not what the show is about  that is there to make you feel uncomfortable. if you only watch shows that make you comfortable probably you will not like allot of good stuff out there.
first cgI green women goes to...she hulk  she had to break some glass ceilings to get this award...
I felt the same as you about got until I finally sat down and went through it. it ended up being one of my favorite series. not a fan of certain gratuitous and rapey scenes in the show  but they honestly weren t as prevalent as I expected. and yeah  some of the decisions with who they killed were at best  questionable  and the ending was rushed  to say the least   but it was still well worth watching. it isn t really fair to say that it was simply made for  shock value  appeal  imo.
omg missed opportunity
yay! doggo is back!
I thought you were going to be ripley for halloween
all those  awards   have become woke participation trophies
damn goth melonie looks good
she-hulk gets awards. just like the woman king got a 99  audience score on rotten tomatoes... which is owned by warner bros. and just like the rings of power only got high audience scores on imdb... which is owned by amazon.  we all know its meaningless. we all know they re being shielded from their own failure. we all know heads are rolling behind closed doors.
awards today are given for wokeness  which is why award shows tank in the ratings.
Imean hollywood is like politicians you have to pay to get nominated
madisynn stole the show  and if she doesnt get a movie with wong  I ll be furious
happy halloween mel!
death never looked so good
damn melanie looking so fine
participation trophies dont stop with jr. high apparently.
the show get nominated is good and epice moon knight should got it more but ok
go marvel if ppl dont watch it anymore  good for them. apparently its oppressing them. I dont pay for disney  but I do have it. being that I do  imma give the shows a chance. tho I thought falcon n ws was crappy  I still watched every episode.
its like those teen movies where they nominate the ugly girl as prom queen for a sweet prank.
never heard of bad bunny  you are super damn lucky.
10 26surfs up  dude.
well at least you got the goth gf part down.  Imean but really its good!
disney has money its thatsimple
so she wasn t really acting huh she just played herself on thatshow didnt she
people told us we were tripping when we said its an agenda
1 01 so she is going to let someone make a fool of her  because thats all that happened with her character in the show  you know the flash   villains   in justice league unlimited and how he beats them in a second then as they sit in the back of the cop car he is talking to them flash  ldid you stop talking your meds again    villain   yes..... I dont like them they taste icky  flash   come on now you know that you have to take your meds  I forget the character name   how about this if you promise to take your meds I ll make sure the guards give you a serving of ice cream  villain smiles   ok  that villain just still had more respect shown to them than her character did  she gets her ass handed to her getting a one hit ko and a few episodes later comes back and try s the exact same thing again.
if you dont know those vapid artists and their products itsimply means that you have some class and brains
drake.... he is the guy from the awesome meme!
which one of y all chose it  I just wanna talk...
they really are that desperate to appease twitter.
9 40 should have technoblade up there. the guy gained 7 million additional subs after dying.
dog rubs his butt on the floor right as the outro begins lol
I ll bet you she-hulk wins.
wow. all of the nominations are a joke. awards are such a joke
haven t watch a movie in years
house of the dragon has alabama in it
she hulkrings of powerstar wars obI wan....and the most wasted franchise of the year goes to all of the above!!!!
wait is the boys nominated
girl you look amazing  thank goodness because this topic is soooo digusting lol.
huh an award punch me melody mac am I dreaming
uncle loving and choking  its fine and not the main story.
bad bunny  bullet train movie. with brad pitt.
lol the dog wiping its but across the floor.
wait people the magazine has awards
I noticed it too  twice even! I cracked up so hard. the vid was awesome but this made it even better.
strong competition indeed for worst show of 2022.
no  it makes sense.  entertainment awards are as woke as it gets.
melonie over here dressed as a goth burglar. she about to steal amazon s and disney s subscribers. xd
at least you have an understandable reason to not watch house of the dragon youre reason is pretty understandable
stranger things was really good this last season.
dang. is goth melonie even hotter   o
yo @melonie mac at 10 25 through 10 45 your dog be using your carpet to scratch the worms  in his butt
nice death costume
gothic singer melonie looks great  d now I imagine a videoclip of Christian death s sick of love with you in it ahahah  youre too young to know what it is I guess but google should help  I could have said church of no return but her outfit is a bitskimpy    and Im not like that  and yes I saw she s sandman s death which copied what gothic girls looked like back in the days
anyone else see the dog scooting its butt across the floor in the background
should be razzie award lol
jamella shouldn t get any acting awards because titania is just her being her.
man  I feel so out of touch with today s pop culture...
I think that outfit would look cool with a pure orange lipstick instead of black
they have to defend tha narrative!
that must be a pity nomination. no way she-hulk gets a mention in any good award. lol
its only legit if its the worst show possible award or if the award was made by like minded people the show was created by
I dont remember who but it might have been clownfish tv read the criteria for  awards  and it was mostly a list of checkboxes like x amount of this represented on and off cameraa. no quality to the writing just who and how many were in the writers room... so I can believe that it gets awards for its... ability to hit enough checkboxes unlike top gun maverick with its story and fan appeal and making of the money.
this is the same thing they did with kathleen kennedy. despite producing crap  they just give them little awards to deflect valid criticism.
great costume I love sandman!!! diddnt you say you wanted to talk to someone about aliens and religion for a story or something that was you let me know.
looooool Imissed that
@melonie mac go boom  yeah I was listening to everything until then then I was just watching the dog haha. good thing it was at the very end of the video or at least thats when I noticed it.
I hope it goes down between house of the dragon and rings of power and that it hot d does.
are you sure its not for  the dog of the year  ...
this reminds me of the meme where obama is giving obama a medal
melonie looking spooky hot
Im sorry but your pet made me laugh when he started dragging himself for a brief second like at 10 26.
those awards are all rigged  nominations are by pay and favor
10 26 the dog was...uh...I dont know.
ya....look alittle gothic tonight. super cute
woww  that award  must be held by a circus.
wow!  melonie mack looks amazing like that!  it is a sexy look for her.  she should do a  brandon lee s  crow review dressed like that!  wow!!!
10 25 dog drags butt across the floor. lol
you look awesome as death.   dream s sister happy halloween
of course  the wokie awards....
youre out of touch  but are you out of time
I dont like gaming thrones
she-hulk needs to be nominated for how much this sucks
love the black lipstick
oh its emo or goth melonie happy halloween love thr black lipstick
nice lipstick reminds me of legend or the crow after a fashion. happy halloween and keep up the good work.
is the award a participation trophy
lol  nice  death  costume and makeup.
hey mel  your clone is asking people to join her on telegram I just might coz she has prizes...
never thought marvel would hang themselves like this
and to think that the prequels were treated worse than she-hulk
hey as an aside  great death cos.
nah  it must be an  awkward  for their twerking or something
I am sure money was involved to even get nominated
is there a razzie award for tv series
social star would have to be mr beast as he has given millions away to people in need.
didn t realize tv shows were based on a youtuber s political identity.
dude house of the dragon mel lol. you gonna give it to rings of power lol.
nice death costume
its up against house of the dragon and stranger things sooo... yeahhh...
they re going against better call saul  house of the dragon and stranger things. she hulk has no chance.

the fact thatshe said house of dragon was boring......you lost me and the credibility bro
I havent been exposed to american music since glee went off the air............so yeah im shocked that list of best bands is mostly groups from back in the day. cant believe any of them are still a thing lol. blackpink is the newest it would seem. go kpop I guess but so not my jam. im a red velvet kinda kpopper
decided by the  general public
its just that meme of obama giving himself an award. when youre the establishment...
she-hulk s getting an award!  what was the category   shiniest turd  or  most expensive trolling-based therapy session for bitter  lonely wine aunts
somehow  isn t good enough for this  there needs to be a  somehowwtf  official new word.  and yet still not even thatsurprising.
good halloween to you.
I cant see she hulk beating out game of incest house of incest.
that dog was dragging its but on the carpet!
honestly  thats not much of an impressive line up for award nominees...   sure there are a few decent nominees here and there is some catagories  but overall there s a whole lot of lack luster for the vast majority of these nominees.
shows how bad the nominating process or people are
I voted for stranger things.
dont forget to stay out of the sunlight and put on sunscreen.
damn  goth drip.
shilling to the extreme
this is even further proof that awards shows are rigged. lol amazing death of the endless btw.
melonie mac go goth
peoples choice award... what people choose this  because the ratings speak for themselves.
was it  female lawyer of the year
I guess that means peoples choice award means jack shit now if they actually gave anything to that train wreck lol
critics know nothing and awards shows have become saturated to the point where they are nothing but stages for out of touch celebrities to virtue signal.
she-hulk gets nominated for an award  so you know some snowflakes are going to get their panties in a bunch.
award     a wart !!!
darwin awards
dig the look! you supposed to be eric draven
death from sandman
@melonie mac go boom  oops. I was way off.
stranger things and house of the dragon are the only 2 decent shows nominated lol  peoples choice  is kind of a stretch when the corps decide what is nominated
u pull off death from the sandman comic u look just like her
how are the two wirst shoes so far on a people s choice thatse caused sanity break
this has to be a living joke
people s choice award  celebrity awards  they re all meaningless anyway.
hmm are you death from sandman cool cosplay except you dont seem to be too deadly if no one annoys you lol
ngl  Im just here for goth gf melonie.
death.  nice costume idea.
lol  bad dog at the end of video
are we collectively getting punked
the black lipstick with your washed out face worked out great !
jameela jamil thinks she owns the world because she s in she hulk
of course it would
award nominations are a joke.
I think I just died.
mfaoo melonie inner weeb came out lol
these awards mean nothing and have meant nothing for a long time
was the award for  worst sandwich ever made
panic at the disco  is just a picture of brendon  that band died years ago.
lol the people s choice award is just as useless as a nickelodeon reward.
yes I am  posted the pics on twitter  insta
ooh! look at you!  lady death
I ll give it an award.  she-hulk gets a bag full of dog   because thats how good it is.
it was nominated for a people s choice award  the people chose not to watch it!
clearly marvel pays to get awards.
look up adam ruins award shows. it will all make sense...
what exactly did jj s character do in this show  er...
cheers fellow blink
award for worst television show of 2022
its like what happened with tlou2  they gonna win because it made fans hate them  so they use the political politic or whatever  something like thatpeople s show award  which people
looking good
nominated ....lmao
when a disaster is nominated for an award...
need good entertainment for halloween    watch the terrifier movies
hey! I got news for ya........all those awards......mean nothing!
who are the  people  that voted for this nomination lmao...
people s choice  what people  who chose this
this is nothing. wait until bros wins the oscar for best picture
why was Imainly watching the dogs in the background.
yep.  time for the obligatory self-pat on the back from hollywoke.
wtf she-hulk get award !
its really just  a participation trophy
tiktok  nominations doesnt count  d
the people have lost their way
everyone knows these various awards are a joke and dont matter anyway  thats why their ratings have been at all time lows for years. so yeah not surprising but also couldn t care less.
it better be a razzie
thats hollywood narcissistic  they are so busy smelling their own flatulence
its really not somehow nowdays. award ceremonies and critic reviews for movies is based on the wokeness meter.
im blushing ...
this is some bullshit award for sure  d I d go through it the same way  I dont know 90  of those 95 if Im honest..
happy halloween
feels more like a participation trophy. who still watches any award shows  they are dead in the water
nice participation trophy.
ouch. down two notches.
the proliferation of softcore porn in standard media is really gross. it doesnt add anything to the story  if it doesnt take away from it. unless the story is about sex  wtf is the point of all the sex in media  itseriously grosses me out  and Im not a prude by any means. its just a massive sign of lack of skill and creativity when I see it
given the choices available  its almost like by default it will get nominated for something... this is terrible.
people s republic award more like it
I feel like these choices are selected based on politics than actual quality.
basically one of the jd power bottom rewards car commercials talk about that nobody has ever heard of or cares about
hey guess what   nobody cares thatshe-hulk got nominated.
btw  nice death   dc  costume
thank youuuuu!
@melonie mac go boom  even when I was a hired teenager I felt like there was something wrong about it   just isn t usually a meaningful addition to most stories

I have an award for them  cringe of the year.
lol  her show ...does she even have much more than 10 minutes of screen time over the course of the 9 episodes
best metal band  slaughter to prevail or lorna shore   I dont know
what people    the critics its a critic choice isn t it
bro  moon knight makes sense  but how the hell did this beat out ms marvel  it was so much better
nowadays award is a joke
happy halloween
woke hollywood takes care of its own.
no cobra kai
see thats just bull right there this sexiest ass show get a people s choice award ...... thatsounds like someone got bribed
I fear how bad could the other shows be if she-hulk was nominated for an award.either that or somebody put the money over the votes.sorry. I finished the video. now I understand. this die is loaded. no matter what people vote. it will be woke.
melanie mommy
song of 2022  up 2 speed  victor mcknight
she woke will get nominated for best and actor and actress because  muh patriarchy bad
can I ask why death would wear a cross
people s choice   I guess now we know which people get to vote on the nominations and nominees.rename it the  wokies  or the  rage baities.
that award ceremony is atrocious across the board...... we have nothing to offer future generations from the mainstream arts  this will truly be considered the dark age of culture.
Imean  yes  yes its a joke..... these award shows have been a bad joke for years now  so who s really surprised disney can just buy them at will
hahaha the choices for shows ha wow there are far better shows on small networks than all but two of those shows ha
the nominees are house of the dragon  stranger things  and some loosers.
whatinthafawkkk ! ahahaha!!!! this cant be real life
I only have one song to singand if I only could I d make a deal with God and I d get him to swap our places be running up that road be running up that hill be running up that building say  if I only could  oh...
wow really shows how low hollywood has fallen.
why excited  she said it was just a job.
why does jamila jamil always cover her eyebrows   wtf is she hiding
the awards was rigged
lol!
and the greatest entitled hypocrite of 2022 award goes to....    she hulk!!!!!

Jesus help us all.

goth melanie mac  make me  go boom.
no wonder these award shows are losing ratings... cant wait till venture capital dries out!!!
rigged
are we really surprised  yes the fans hated it its even made lifelong comic she hulk fans stop liking she hulk  its losing disney money but that wont stop the zealots  they wont let little things like reason or facts get in their way.
of that list  I d vote for la brea just because everything else sucks  even tho stranger things doesnt suck by the actors have said some dirty things . thatsaid  my God these category nominations are trash ... mr. beast tho 1000
pharah costume
proof these awards are tightly controlled   rigged.melonie as death is better than anything in that recent adaptation of sandman.
sorry  didn t know the character until I saw a comment explaining...let me correct myself...death of the endless melanie mac  make me  go boom.
youre a texan and you dont listen to country!!! Im not alone!!!
participation trophy
spoiler  disney stans bots will flood the voting and she-hulk wins

meh  we all know awards mean nothing nowadays.I guess the 8 people watching voted.
so participation trophies
Im new here. is there something commonplace about the dog at 10 25 on this channel  or am I just really immature to notice   if its the latter  please dont answer that
collaboration song of 2022 is waiting on the sky to change by starset ft. breaking benjamin
I haven t watched got or hod because I am sick of dark fantasy.
are you death from the sandman
beacuse of course it did...
love video cause of doggo
I really tried to watch it but could only take 2 episodes its so bad...
house of the dragonqualityno awardsshe hulktrash  gets the people choice award how
out of that list... eh stranger things would be the best probably.
what  people you mean crazy people award
mega
the dislike button is back. not that I need it. but wth  this is interesting!
people s choice  what people
ofc you hunger for.good entertainment. people think house of the dragon is more then below avrage show
people s choice  she-hulk  not a chance  blatantly reeks of  bought and paid for
well  it is people s choice  so everyone liked it except youtubers who dont like anything.
hey the love guru wonthe award for worst movie of the year in 2008 and that movie rocks! let s not loose hope
nominated for best show  doesnt even crack the top 10 in the neilson ratings. lmfao
is it for  services to ending the patriarchy
she-hulk gets nominated for award and anti-sjw s lose their minds.
aren t these nominations bought and paid for.
you are not out to touch  most of the stuff thats nominated isn t even what s mostly popular  its just a bunch of stuff the ones in charge want up there  most of its crap
do people still care about those awards  been years since I bothered.
this must be a joke. it has to be. how is this even possible  -_-still dont understand  how you can be bored from got and house of dragon.
what s really telling is that it only got one nomination  nothing for acting and the marvel show trying to be a comedy sitcom didn t get comedy  but sci-fI fantasy
I dont mean to sound like a simp but  that black color works.
does that little scooter need his glands expressed
!!I am gonna show you! ! the...importance...of the teen choice ....rewardok 1ne movie star stated ooooooh teen choice  I won one of those.  what happened. let me see it  aaaaaawww  I was at a burger joint after the show. left it by the register. too smashed after the after party.didnt go back to get it or !hey  I won a reward!!man  that is too big to fit in the limo  uh  just leave it ormodernfamiliesphil dunphee and I quote hey  man....I have one of those already..... look....I dont have any more room for them .....unquote
okay and who cares  why dont we make our own award show where we make really offensive trophies to send these people
simple  money  or access.
so... who s going to tell her thatshe got nominated because she s brown
they will win remember tlou2   it won everything when itshould have won maybe 2 awards  . awards are fixed
when elon wipes these bots  we ll get to see how many fans they really are...
was it a razzie award  thats the only one that would make sense.
im going defend mcu
who selects these programmes
do people s choice awards suck
nominated for a delusional crazy people s choice award.
babe looking fine
only thing worth watching out of all that was obI wan
which  people    btw  y ou look helluva better death than the gal in netflix sandman series.
comedy act of 2022first person   amy schmer.you gotta be fucking kidding.
of course.
I wonder how much money disney have to pay for this  award  to prove people wrong about the show ..
it ll get an award on show no one will watch.
its dI ney though...
please the be the razzies  please the be the razzies  please the be the razzies...damn...
please show me which people chose to nominate this show for anything.this is bs.this is why I dont really watch these awards shows.
the people choice.hilarious  the show trolling fans.clown world.
peoples choice award is vapid
was it the best female lawyer award where 6 women all get participation trophies
w0-0-t !
kinda the same thing here as any female who acted in a harvey weinstein movie as the lead somehow ended up with an academy award  the truth will out on this one.
so out of those it would be stranger things and hotd. too bad they make a deal and voting is just a charade. she hulk or rangs of power will win anyway.there is really no competition. hotd is just how royalty worked in olden days  they married for politics and kept bloodline  pure  of common people... marrying cousins and siblings was the result.
peoples choice awards are just as worthless as the oscars. back in 2015 maleficent beat 22 jump street  guardians of the galaxy  captain america winter soldier and xmen days of future past
a razzi
people dont understand these awards are paid for not earned. its a fucking joke.
these awards are bought.
stranger things is definitely winning
do you ever listen to leo moracchioli
rigged the f out  to show how woke they  are .
what s with the ankh  isis
no award that mattered
when both audience and critics hate your product  this is the last resort to treat a part of your ego s bruises  and also a pathetic attempt to bend reality and rewrite history.
we all already saw how rewards shows can be fixed they not worth shit anymore. there was backlash from the last of us 2 winning some award when the game was built on lies and had a trash story.
razzie  or is it critics choice award  because no one is watching it
what  some serious bs going on if true. that means the peoples choice award is a scam.
who cares about the people s choices awards  or better yet any award shows anymore. watch  she hulk  win over  stranger things
are you effing wiht me!
if you like hard rock and metal  you should check out the band theocracy. they re a Christian metal band.
her show  she was a side character that did practically nothing in the show.
lol  people s choice    yeah right.
moon knight is the only decent one
wouldn t a Christian metal band be an oxymoron
@john buck  not at all. there are several Christian metal bands  though most of them have rather generic-sounding music.I know people tend to associate metal with rebellion and such  but in the end it is just a style of music  regardless of its associations.even so  in this day and age  being Christian is alot like being rebellious  since the rest of the world seems to only want to suppress the truth.
what people  wtf is wrong with the world
why is there a rat in the background
if its the worst series  it will lose to the rings of power....lol
these wokesters are truly delusional
the only good shows right now are house of dragon and star wars andor
the shill media will desperately try to get this show nominiated for every woke or garbage award going.
what peoples!!!  who are all these peoples!!!!
was it a razzie
hey  try not using the word gratuitous. its one of those unessesay words that doesnt convey what youreally mean  but is more just linguistic flexing. if you want to use it  then set it up with fancy language beforehand.  thanks  tony.
the only reward itshould get is worst show of 2022
house of the dragon will win.
how many critters you got an intelligent woman can get whatever she wants.
well not really.....its the people s choice. the people can enjoy mediocrity. the award is also non important
wear that lipstick more mreeow
anyone remember the razzies  no
worst nomination which you can even find
nomination doesnt mean win lol. peoples choice  which people  lmao.
obligatory honk-honk   comment.
she was hardly even in the show
black pink should win!!!
your goth now
is it april 1st
this is almost as funny as the time obama got nominated for the nobel peace prize for wanting world peace.
the she-hulk photo looks so ugly and out of place with the other ones in the category
yet another demonstration of the fact that these awards and their shows are a waste of precious time  money  space  and metal...
is it a razzie
where s slipknot for the group of 2022
knowing the award scene for the last 15  years from the inside  Im not surprised at all. any music or entertainment awards from the last 15-20 years are basically all invalid. you can add recent olympic medals and nobel  peace  prizes to that pool of fake bs awards nobody should consider  good  or  an accolade  anymore.winning any medal in any of these categories for at least 2-ish decades should immediately tell everybody that isn t rheetahrded that the body of work was done by somebody with no talent who was artificially elevated over worthy people due to wokeness probably and the body of work is of bottom-barrel trash-juice quality because the person who created it had no skills  but who had a huge studio and millions or billions in corporate backing marketing producing processing.literally any big or well-known medals awards that used to be given out to only top quality work are completely discredited post-2000s.
I dont know anyone that you mentioned except snoop and beyonce  and I dont like either of them
the only award the show should receive is a razzie.
why do they hire people that hate the material  when did it become normal to shit on the fans
what show is she talking about  no such show exists. come on people with minimal effort we can memory hole that abomination. let s go !!!
are you kidding me  best scI fI  raised by wolves season 2 was in february! uncancel thatshow! wait raised by wolves was nominated for nothing!!!  seriously if you all haven t watched thatshow go watch it!!!
oh we are absolutely giving you a peoples choice nomination... but fuck me its not for  best show ..
this dumpster fire of a show should be nominated -  for multiple razzies
peeporun
titania almost non existant.
awards shows and awards means shit.
what the hell was that  peoples choice awards  garbage  also metal is the best music genre.
this is my halloween costume of death from sandman lol
@melonie mac go boom  okay because I thought you were going through a phase.
now  if it was for a golden razzie I could understand. but people s choice  what people are choosing this crap
boomer alert    boomer alert    . melonie s a boomer.
this is a offensive misuse of the word  people s
3 41 I d rather umbrella academy or stanger things win that award.she-hulk  rings of power and obi-wan we all know should not have even been remotely nominated. nothing but  greasing hands with the  of  hollywood elitedom  to get the ball rolling when everybody knows that any other shows would have even worthy candidates.
hub hub  amen
people s choice is a meaningless award show imo.
holy fuck that black lipstick. I would pop in 3 milliseconds.
with lots of money  you can afford to make a show nobody likes  alter ratings  and buy yourself an award. we swim in a sea of lies. lies everywhere.
scifI fantasy award  where is this scifI or fantasy  lol God. our standards have really lowered for those award lol
lolol!  its funny how a show about uncle @   ing   pedophilia is one of the best on television!  fingers crossed stranger things takes everything.  I guess witcher season 2 counted as 2021
a woke awards ceremony nominating a woke show to please woke people and their culture.nothing surprise me
worst show award  sure. people s choice award  what people  bought critics  yup.
only award thatshow deserves is a razzie.
people s choice award for trashiest most nonsensical plot   I dont know she-hulk might have to fight with rings of power to win that award!
no its the children who are wrong.
even the rings of power is nominated. this is just bullshit
money  money  money  not even funny.
twincest
a razzie
lol leave it to a religious person to be offended by a show
rings of power will get the same treatment.  its like when they gave obarry the nobel piece prize just for being elected.
wtf nominated for the best bullshit on television
I could die happy today if marvel came out and made official the non use of this titania actress. nothing against her portrayal  but this actress on social media..
hey  death isnt supposed to be white!   constantine is a woman. _jc
unless its a razzie Im calling bs!
Imean if disney is woke  y b surprised   a lot of left bums were making books as if they are heroes. we both know the left just had gone too far and will do anything to hurt u like dictators. dictator joe is not here for u. tbh I didn t think she hulk was that bad. it was as bad as falcon n ws. the only good thing that happened to thatshow was zimo. the only good that came out of sh was seeing daredevil. imma still watch marvel stuff bcuz I dont care if they go woke. ik when they tripping but thats barely in my eyes. blm  antifa  dems  n biden has awaken the monster called woke. maybe influencing that bs but if I dont c it imma keep watching marvel. u do bcuz its what u do to get paid. stay awesome
stranger things is probably going to win that category. everything else in that category sucked ass.
great  add more fuel to the egos of these pathetic excuses for writers. this series deserves nothing because itserves nothing. if it wins  everyone will know that the people s vote doesnt count.
the award for worst writing in a garbage tv show that nobody watched goes to... she-hulk
I feel like this music generation has put out nothing but   if the artist came out  no pun intended  after 2010  no thanks
people s choice   -d more like  the feminists choice award.
this remind me when obama got nominated for the peace prize after being elect.  not for what he did cause what he may do
nominated for an award  that just solidifies how trash it is lol
a nother insult! wait! you are so cute not liking  thee  game of thrones because of their incestoh  bless youre poor soilat least we know you wont like kentucky
I saw the first few episodes of game of thrones and found it too dark  gloomy  and plotless  so I skipped the rest.  I prefer babylon 5 or the first two star trek series.  I dont know of any science fiction television shows this year that are worthy of an award.
oh wow... probably someone owes them a favor... what a crap show.
you all have to stop thinking these kind of things are jokes  even as a figure of speech  you are underestimating their cynicism by doing that.
and the award for the most repugnantly offensive  fan baiting  poorly written  badly cgied  woke garbage goes to...... she-hulk!!!!!!    accepting the award on behalf of the writers will be  well anybody who could be arsed turning up...
oh boy!!! dream come true!!!  hopefully they waste more money on this s--t show as well as rings of pooer.  watching people make fun of all this s--t is my new entertainment.  lol
thanks for watching I really appreciate  message me by the name above to receive gifts
moon knight was better
yeah well the incest is meant to make you uncomfortable. ths show s not celebrating it
as a big fantasy fan  I want to like game of thrones  but the inc  t stuff turned me off too. couldn t get past the 1st episode. I dont hate it though  unlike rings of power. thatshow should be banished off the earth.
I watch house of the dragon but I wish it didn t have the inc st garbage. it makes the show worse
7 13 blackpink is the revolution blackpink in your area
oh damn. I cut the video off when you said you dont like game of thrones. your taste cant be trusted.
what people
best show   pffftttt.  whatevs.
sorry  but there is no fucking way this show got nominated for a peoples chouce award. no fucking way.
sure  why not  let s award a moronic  self insert cringefest that celebrates misandry  karen-ness  lack of any social quality  lack of self-awareness and that regularly insults fans  source materials and characters...
bottom of the barrel choice among titans. disney s garbage shouldn t even be on the ballot and deserves to be ignored  same thing with amazon s rings of power.
Jesus Christ. they need to let this show just die. it needs to be buried and forgotten like inhumans.
oh course it would ..its so painfully obvious these woke nutcases would nominate this stupid show would be glorified .
do you still believe in nominations being clean  please. from the oscars to the nobel  they ve all been polluted by politics. treat awards the way you treat moden journalism  and youre likely to hit the bullseye more often than not.
nobody likes everything. why are we still talking about this
Im calling b
sorry but I cant take someone who says her pronouns  she her as we dont underastand thatshe is a woman..
house of the dragon is the only show worthy of a win. the rest of those shows ssssuuuucccckkk!!!!
are you fucking kidding
fix your mic so I can listen to you properly. it hurts my ears.
well it made me too uncomfortable to watch anyway  I dont fault anyone for liking the show tho lol
dont like it dont watch it. not every mcu or marvel is made for you. jokes on you and exposes you. oppression at its finest
thatshow sucked so bad
what award   the  tampies  for most obnoxious feminist caricature
male artists.. who the fuck are these guys..female artists.. oh man Ive listen to all.xdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
worst crap I am sooo glad I never watched all the way through award! nothing wrong at all with the comic book hero known as she hulk but the show was not good.
booooo. its fictional. hotd is awesome.
omg you play with your hair way to much hahaha I think you have a problem
I find your use of white face incredibly disrespectful  and  referring to yourself as  death  because of a lighter complexion is simply disgusting. skin color is not a costume.   s
the incest in game of thrones is supposed to be repulsive  thats the pointdisliked for not getting thru the first few got episodes
stranger things is terrible too dude
she s a horrible actress....and person.
yea  no  rop is shit  she hulk is shit. the rest is meh. so I hope game of thrones wins I guess  if that is what we can pick from  maybe stranger things should win.
dragons and medieval armor-wearing shows are garbage. spears and swords. like gtfo
game of thrones was boring and disgusting
jeez  youre gonna hurt your head  diving into  all these videos.seriously tho  stahp it.its really fucking stupid.especially when said literally back to back like in this video.
