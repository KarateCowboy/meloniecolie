thank you  brie. for finally driving a stake through the heart of a franchise thatshould have been dead years ago.
well if the last movie didn t kill the franchise  then Im sure brie larson can singlehandedly finish the job
yes because if you want to get an audience pumped to go see the next installment into a long standing franchise such as the fast saga. casting brie larson in your next film is definitely going to get people into the theater to watch your next movie  I guess the fast franchise isn t made for me    xd
Ive been a huge fan of the fast and the furious franchise for decades now and was looking forward to another entry to the franchise. now that they ve casted brie larson into this next entry into the long standing series. I doubt I ll be going to the theaters to watch this film when it releases in theaters. lol
reading vin s post actually had me wincing in pain the cringe was so strong.
suspicion  brie doesnt really have any public opinions  just jumps on the current thing in the hopes it will advance her career
I watched an episode of bear grylls with brie in it and somehow she managed to be the least likeable despite the tarantula. and I strongly dislike spiders. but Ive got to say thatspider was truly charismatic compared to her.
3 minutes of brie larson and fast 1015 minutes of her love for lara croft I love this channel.
I did not expect this. tbh furious 7 was a perfect end
there is literally no faster way to kill a franchise than by shoehorning brie  wasn t made for him  larson into it.
hearing that blunt take on salvation can be a shock to some  but it really emphasizes how serious a topic this. we re talking about forever here.thanks for sharing these verses. faith is personal and it takes bravery to be open about. looking forward to checking out your ig.
keep up the excellent work  melonie. youre awesome.
but melonie  brie larson will be like the bestest driver ever with her electric nissan.
vin is a decent dude  from what Ive gathered.  I hope he knows what s he doing bringing larson on the set of the next installment of the craziest car show in movies.have to add  pick up the fast and the furious .  no seal team six-wannabe characters  just two opposing drivers having to work together at some point  with solid racing and dramatic scenes.
I haven t had the desire to watch anything past the first movie. Im not a 16 year old pretending to have a fast car after watching that movie. I look forward to your verse of the day because above all  being a good person is the key to a happy life and afterlife.
I cant wait to see a plank of wood drive a fast car! I hear she does her own stunts  so this might be interesting. the crew might want to bring marshmellows lol
I really liked the Bible verse for this episode. its been kind of hit and miss for verses thatspeak to me in your videos  I still listen to them all the way through because I think filling my mind with God s word and people talking about it will help me a lot   but Ive been stuck in a sort of depressive  ptsd spiral since april 2019 and hearing that verse again feels so good.
only 1 23 in and tomb raider is already mentioned lol. I love how your passion for that game franchise just takes over.
off topic have you seen any episodes of the chosen   this a good week to catch up if you haven t.question about laura croft in your opinion  would it be appropriate if there was a npc saying   it belongs in a museum!  laura turns to him  whips out her pistol and shoots him
that picture of vin diesel and brie larson looks like a hostage situation. someone please send vin diesel help.
@sebangler   agree
yeah  I cant imagine that it ll help.
the wokester is stoked brother! queen brie is woke! woke-a-mania is running wild!
I stopped when john cena had his china apology  but adding brie larson is the  double tap .
Im torn here. on one hand I really dont like these movies and therefore I am happy to see it die. on the other hand  I know a lot of people do like them and I dont want them to suffer the same disappointment that fans of marvel  basmatI blues and nfts do because of her.
@g vnhtsm  so you watched with charlize theron !
fast and furious died without paul walker
your post had 123 likes  but I had to upvote anyway.
chicomcena pretty well flattened all the tires of the franchise  which was sad considering han and sean were back.
@david harvey  same here  gotta remember to  double tap  to make sure!
single-handedly hire a stuntworker to murder it and then do an interview tour about how she murders her own franchises
yea but the brie larson haters are a small minority. average movie goers dont care about what actors say. also the majority of fast n furious fans like myself not letting brie larson stop us from watching it. heck charlize theron is in these movies and that doesnt stop me either. dont  care about actors opinions. brie larson is now part of 2 billionaire dollar franchises. like her or not she s winning. not sure why people who claim to hate her  constantly talk about her  skip her movies and move on. funny thing is she s not even the worst of the worst in hollywood  never been in any legal trouble. many that hate her defended people like joe rogan and mel gibson  baffling to me. heck ezra miller been in the news multiple times and dont get as much hate. tom holland and Christian bale made similar comments to brie larson. jason mamoa told trump supporters to unfollow him on twitter  he was cast in fast 10 also. its just popular to hate brie larson. stories about her gets clicks. its fake outrage. grown men crying over this woman is super beta male and fragile. universal and disney dont care about crying youtubers  if they did  most of these movies probably still look like phase 1 and 2.
you dont want to see  paula walker
didn t they have cardI b in the last one  it cant be any worse than that.
cmon now cardI b and charlize theron are in these movies. lol charlize be dressing her son as a girl and calling people that dont wear mask holes and cardI b is just cardI b. if I based watching movies on what actors say  I be watching nothing! gal gadot was part of this franchise too   who said if your not a feminist then youre a sexist. tom holland said marvel needs to hire more than just straight white guys. Christian bale said hollywood and the world would be be better if white dudes weren t running everything. I just ignore this stuff and focus on the entertainment. I watch what interest me and skip what doesnt. fast n furious is about action  fighting  car stunts  jokes  etc. brie larson is not the star of the movie  just an added character. jason mamoa is also in it. he told trump supporters to unfollow him on twitter. it is what it is. brie larson not even the worst of the worst in hollywood. jeremy renner has abuse allegations against him. ezra miller constantly in the news for something crazy. the actor that plays homelander was recently arrested. the list goes on and on.
I feel so bad for that guy.. he s like the myspace generation kid that never developed self awareness
he was overly generous with the praise  thats for sure.
ah yes just  like 90  other actors in hollywood
the spider is only an innocent  yet spooky  lI l arachnid   it cant help itself.  ms. cheese wheel can easily fix that antagonistic attitude with all her millions - the q is if she wants to.
did bear almost put her on the fire since she s so wooden
@bw estacado  well  the only time they made a fire was to make food  at least thats what I remembered  so using such a big log would have been a bit of a waste of materials
perfectly balanced  as all things should be.   -thanos  2018
I turned off from the series when paul did at the end  may he rest in peace  driving like a banshee on the great racetrack in the sky .  seems wrong to me to continue without his character there.
I would bet someone in the movie will have a car with captain marvel all over.
I d like to see how brie justify promoting driving gas gusling muscle cars to her woke friends. I thought brie was woke on the environmen  and against burning fossil fule.
what passion  she never mentions her at all!
oh Lord  jeremy must be so happy!
lol thanks melonie for this always entertaining laughter video of yours.takecare melonie
cant wait to see just plain furious.
when are the dmc rants gonna make their debut  thats what I wanna know.hopefully when the next franchise gets rebooted we can get into how not to do it lol
why ! thats the only question that comes to mind. who on earth wanted her in this movie
thats awesome  congratulations  to brie larson on casting in these two final movies  as brian s long-lost little baby sister stephanie o connor! the o connor siblings will be portrayed by matt damon  charlie hunnam  hayden Christensen  chris hemsworth  caleb walker and cody walker! harrison ford s character as the father of brian  darryl  scott  josh  stephanie!
brie s character is properly going to know martial arts out of the blue
its gonna take us independents who actually care about story to make great content....... and amen to the verse you chose
I   how honest you are about your faith. never lose that
I know when somebody is joining an ongoing thing  and ruins it ... like tomb raider ! welp  you jinxed it. now we re gonna get   brie larson confirmed as new lara croft .
this just makes me feel like Im back in high school. but  I hear immaturity is on the rise so its all good I guess
good Lord  as if fast and furious needs to embarrass themselves any more than they have already done to themselves lately.
Im so glad that I am fussy about what I watch and follow. flying fxck 10  I thought it died at 3.. great channel loving the content with humour.x stay safe everyone. cheer s
I think when this movie releases a seriously bigger number of people will feel motivated to finally meet up with paul walker
love the Bible verses portion of every video. thank you for your interpretations
this series died for me long ago. paul walker passing was pretty much it. I thought he and dom cruising into the sunset was the best ending there could ve been. headcanon.
fast and furious 50 breaking the sound barrier on our walkers!    get off my lawn!
that laugh.
the first movie is my favorite one.
I absolutely love the Bible verse portion of your videos!  thats what got me to subscribe!
those memes were great for me  too.
brie will be the first to beat dom in a race too.
yup like all the rest of them. letty is basically black widow. michelle rodriguez asked for the women to do more. she threatened to leave. ludacris character knows martial arts too and mia. letty beat ronda rousy and gina carano character and brian beat tony jaa. and dom toretto turns into the hulk and defeats everyone. brie larson doing martial arts is a nothing burger. its fast n furious
wow!
I lost interest when itstopped being about racing. im okay with police shennanigans being tacked on top of it  but the racing was the heart of the series as far as my interest went.
you have every right to feel that way but part 8 was solid. its not that deep to hate because brie larson is casted. this weird creepy brie larson outrage is ridiculous. its manufactured bull crap. tom holland and Christian bale made similar comments. heck mel gibson in movies. ezra miller constantly in the news and no one was talking about him or boycotting the flash. manufactured fake outrage over brie.  chris evans mark ruffalo all talk social issues. gal gadot made comments also. brie is just content gold for youtubers. it reminds me of trump outrage that the left does the right just as bad these days. many upset dont even watch fast n furious movies. as a fan of the franchise Im excited. mamoa and larson are good editions
nah its not manufactured outrage.
it is. she s popular and gets youtubers clicks. many have said similar  things and many actors have done terrible things. some broke the law and dont get this same level of hate. charlize theron is in these movies. same one dressing here adopted son as a girl and the same one calling ppl mask holes for not wearing mask cmon now !!!
@kicknowledge smith  its not I dislike her movies and her public persona. I also think mark ruffalo is the worst hulk to date  ezra miller looks the part but he s an absolute mess irl and he doesnt act in his films. I think you ve just made up your mind about a few things and decided that everyone else goes against the opinion youre laying out here to fiercen your argument.its not manufactured  she s mediocre and ff was already dying  adding her is like if you killed off homer simpson and replaced him with peter griffin. like who would even care and what is the point.
@a person   I think you ve just made up your mind about a few things and decided that everyone else goes against the opinion youre laying out here to fiercen your argument. this is false. Im not the biggest brie larson fan  I just think all this hate is ridiculous at this point. itseems to be for sport. Im just saying she isn t even the worst of the worst in hollywood. many actors are saying similar comments. if you dislike her fine  but Im not letting this stop me from watching a movie. no hard feelings  I respect your opinions. all good.
@kicknowledge smith  outrage is a strong word. as I said the series died long ago. but I have to say brie is pretty stiff in her acting  not that ff is renowned for its performances . every role Ive seen her play has been the overtly strong female with a chip on her shoulder role  boring   so you know what kind of addition to the team she will be. she s just not a person you d expect to see in this franchise  so its perplexing on multiple levels  even jarring. Imean  you might be able to add hayden Christensen as brian s long lost little brother and it would ve made more sense as a casting choice.  I just cant with this series any more.
yeah  paul s passing shouldve been the end  the rest is just cash grabs and cheap effects  but hey thats brie s speciality.  her acting has been appauling  from 21 jump st all the way to captain marvel.  it is so bad the studio completely overhauled captain marvel 2  so she isn t going to be the main character  because she is so disliked everywhere!  her  paid for  youtube channel has divebombed once the shills stopped being paid to watch  because itshowed everyone just how fake and untalented she actually is.
@simon m  I get that you hate brie larson and thats fine. but fast n furious is a billion dollar franchise  captain marvel also made a billion. wasn t a great movie  but not as bad as the brie larson haters make it out to be. nissan making tons of money too and she s an oscar winner. I dont think fast movies are going for oscars. and she s still the top paid actress in the marvels  and will be the main character. it has nothing to do with her being disliked as to why its not called captain marvel 2. captain marvel 2 and the marvels sounds silly. its a movie featuring all 3 marvel characters  of course many would try to spin it to fit their narrative. we have no clue who the other characters are   thus far  we got a little bit about monica rambeau from wanda vision and we are about to get ms marvel on disney plus. 2 unknown actresses characters are not the stars over brie larson.  if disney was listening to youtubers  brie larson be gone and most mcu movies would look like phase 1 and 2. she was also in the end creditscene for shang chi. she is one of the leaders of the avengers.  she s so popular she s content gold for youtubers.
@dying rose   not that ff is renowned for its performances  this I agree withalso brie larson is a solid actress  especially in drama  comedy type roles. she does have an oscar for the room  she was very good in that. captain marvel was her first block buster role  where she was in the spotlight. she admitted this was awkward for her.  I didn t think she was terrible in captain marvel. I thought it was poorly written. also captain marvel is the same in the comics  she played the role spot on. Im sure after losing to thanos  she is dealing with a lot  that will develop her character. her losing also caused tony to have to snap  killing him. there were parts I did enjoy in captain marvel. I thought she was better in endgame. most of the criticism  is because many hate the actress  so there s a bias. I also liked in her kong skull island and scott pilgrim. I hear you on being exhausted from fast n furious and thats fine. your choice but many others are enjoying it  its a billion dollar franchise. many are hyped for the new casting. jason mamoa was also added to the franchise. many covering this story only because brie larson. people need to move on. but they wont  its content. she s popular and gets youtubers clicks. if you think people wont watch this film  because brie larson  youre mistaken  this movie will get so much publicity because of her.  listen I not a brie larson super fan or anything  I just dont care about stuff actors say  if I did  I  d probably hate them all.
the last one was soulless. I liked the rest of them and the spin-off. the villain was really  really stupid. the other ones had rememberable villains and the action was decent. I do not mind over the top action but I do require a bit of a story. even the characters were not as good.
@nemesis the slasher   yea I hated the last one. I liked parts 1  4  5  6 and 8. part 7 had potential  but the passing of paul walker made that one weird for me. you do make a good point about the story aspect. I think the fact that they are making a lot of money hurt that aspect. they basically see no need for change because it has a cult following. they are the avengers at this point
wait  you haven t even seen the first fast and furious  that one is a classic   you ve gotta at least put that on your list.
in most cases  those  slow walking  scenes are loading screens in disguise. thought you would ve understood that at least.
greetings from croatia !!!your laughter is contagious.
I saw somewhere that a person said they would be disappointed if the next one wasn t called fast 10 your seat belts or used it in their marketing.  hope your monday is blessed.
the biggest problem with ff7r is the pacing. square-enix either stretched out some stories   added some new ones in  or slowed some other main story missions. it killed the pacing of the story  especially when compared to the original.
love the verse of the day!keep going this cannel is great!
its a good thing I never could get into fast and furious.
eh  got all dvds blu-rays up until fast and furious 7 then I went to see 8 in cinema just to see how the mood was without paul.sometimes you just gotta mentally end a series  even if the producers dont think so.
this is like an april fools joke
the fast and furious franchise is including more and more buff dudes. they re all there  think about it. vin diesel  jason momoa  the rock  cena  brie...
I appreciate your Bible verses at the end of your videos. the world needs more messages of hope.
brie larson is an actress  I thought she was just a meme.
gotta admit. melonie is the biggest tomb raider fan I have found on youtube. prob will explode with 50 vids when the game come out. lol great vids
undertaker s gong soundwelp fast and furious franchise  its been real.  brie larson just wrote your names down in the death note.
I cant believe they keep making these movies.
at this point you should just call this the  melonie mac go boom  and tomb raider   channel.   also  thats very interesting that youre challenging the church s traditional teachings on hell. I have a similar viewpoint on that  because the church ignores lots of verses about this subject. that makes me feel less alone in thinking this.also  you gave off strong  this is sparta    vibes when you said  if youre going to come into my home and be offended by my opinions thats on you.
Im french  and to me  brie is a type of cheese. I like brie  the cheese  not sure about brie the actress !
love you for voicing your opinion and beliefs and how you tell it like it is. its great to see you say that Jesus is the only way!
let s see if the cast of fast   furious dislike her as much as marvel cast did...
need to get her sign the contract  then hand her an entirely un-woke script and meet the new executive producer ben shapiro.. that would be awesome.
yup and part 5 is good too.
@kicknowledge smith  funny thing is that with 5 6 an 7  the series could have ended with any one of them. they just kept making more because money.
@bomber 44  yup true. I think even after 11 there will be a female team up movie. I think I seen something about that.
tell me about it. star wars  the mcu  and game of thrones all happened to close to one another. so much greatness turned to shit recently.
nah it be fine. the true fast n furious fans not worried or crying about some actress also jason mamoa was cast as well. his fans will watch also
this time next year  there ll be a new tomb raider movie and larson will be the lead  because screw all of us lol
this will go over like a lead balloon.
the series already jumped the shark when they added john  sorry china  cena. brie was added to stab the shark.
vin diesel is definitely spreading some brie..
so  vin wants to end the franchise.this will not end well.no  its not just catpan marvel thats hated  its bree herself.
have to admit marvel studios still run circles around the dcmu.
her credentials are thatshe was in a commercial for yugo.
charlize theron was in fast   furious 8 - the one in which  for all intents and purposes  was the end of the franchise...I personally dont know how I feel about fast   furious 9  let alone 10. . . .err  behold the movie universe version of halo ! !  and at this point  sounds like shots fired - and yeah  I went there!
I think brie larson likes being a meme to be honest mel lol!
this is my wish for you comfort on difficult days smiles when sadness intrudes rainbows to follow the clouds laughter to kiss your lips sunsets to warm your heart hugs when spirits sag beauty for your eyes to see friendships to brighten your being faith so that you can believe confidence for when you doubt courage to know yourself patience to accept the truth love to complete your life.
your not wrong about final fantasy 7 remake. I will still buy the part 2  300 edition just because I like the original so much. but the game itself is all just nostalgia. the gameplay itself was missing soul. felt like I was more playing a movie than anything. dont get me wrong I enjoyed the movie game. but if square enix wanted to make a movie just make one or even a tv show.  I hope part 2 square enix actually makes the gameplay more fun. but based on what I saw with that kingdom heart 4 trailer I dont have high hopes.
I just saw that you had a gaming channel. how often do you stream
I have some friends who are atheist or agnostic who I genuinely worry about what lays in store for them after death. Ive had good discussions with them about it and about God and Jesus in general but never have really been able to make any headway. Im not the kind of person who is going to beat someone else over the head with my beliefs but if the topic comes up I will do my best to explain them and try to bring a nonbeliever to Christ or at least plant a seed of interest in learning more.
well said.
germy from the  . 25ering is gonna love this
fast and fourious 1 2 and tokyo drift was awesome  everything after that was abomination. and 9 part should be shown in prisons for punishment
kill me
when it comes to acting chops  I cant think of anyone better than brie larson to join the fast franchise. but  by golly  what in tarnation is vin diesel smoking !
talking smack about jeremy s queen
I can see it now  she s going to play brian s long lost woke sister brianna that comes to  educate  the team on toxic masculinity.
well foot!
fast and the furious stop being good after tokyo drift. to add to your point  who should you be more afraid of death itself or the being that can crush your very soul out of existence. Ive always understood it as we should live our lives with complete faith never faltering even in death because there s an eternity after. live your life with the expectation that its a test for the life thereafter
the woke and the furious. sounds like a twitter day when chris pratt makes headlines for attending church.
we are not meant to hide our faith like a light under a bushel basket. we are meant to shine our light high and bright to lead people to the truth.
haven t kept up with the drama surrounding her  is she no longer working with disney
well  they ve jumped a lot of things in the fast movies...but now they ve jumped the shark. cant wait to see her pre-release press conference where she tells the fans that the film isn t made for them and that this is her platform for spewing her crap.  good luck  mr. disel.
f f is an example of how you can do a total of shit with a really nice series.
idc if brie larson is in fast 10 as long as the action is good that is all that I care about
melanie  for love of God  keep talking about tomb raider  I love it.
casting brie is the studio trying to kill a franchise even they are tired of making. change my mind
you could make a video about a new type of silly putty and 5 mins in it d be about tomb raider  Im not picking on you  you are passionate about something and when you are passionate about things your mind will always move to that thing  I started writing when I was 15 and Ive built a universe that Ive been working on for 13 years now  ya see what Imean here I am talking about you and I shoehorned my stuff into it  it is what I am passionate about so I talk about it.this was a long comment but there it is  love the channel  keep up the good work and  fight the good fight.
I wasn t happy about the news but I just hope her character is likable. I would rather have johnny depp enter the franchise.
fast and the furious out of gas
I guess this is the final hole to sink and finish this long overdue franchise. anything past tokyo drift could be an entire different franchise  or a proper spy action sequence.also  petition to rename reboot lara as lauren croft  since she s a completely different character.
I think  brie larson  should be  the next lara croft
what price is headcanon worth I learned my lesson after watching alien 3. haven t seen beyond terminator 2  star wars ep 6  f f 5  and lotr return of the king being the ones Im most glad for.sadly some stinkers slip thru on the way to better films. odd numbered star treks generations is  7 and insurrection is  9 . rocky 5. thor dark world. but the follow-up films soothe the ache in my headcanon.remakes  nothing beats the  80s with the fly  scarface  the thing  scrooged  and even little shop of horrors. that has saved me from ghostbusters 2016  tomb raider 2018  conan 2011  and nightmare on elm street 2010 among many.headcanon is like virginity. once you lose it  you can never get it back. protect it zealously.
poor brie  wherever she goes  disaster follows ! ... she needs a drastic change in her beliefs  in order to change her life completly
they are still making fast and ferious movies    when will it end
I used to wonder that  too  melonie  if there would be a  second death   as it were  but it was the gospel according to matthew 25 41 that proved to me  no  hell is eternal  specifically where the Lord calls it  eternal  fire.  now  is the  fire  literal fire   indeed  that is a question.  in light of  fire  as mentioned in the gospel according to john 2 17 --  his disciples remembered that the scripture says   my devotion to your house  o God  burns in me like a fire   -- I wonder if the  fire  of hell is actually the eternal separation from God s love and our need for his love  not actual  literal fire.  just some food for thought in your studies on hell.  anyhow  happy easter!
could be worse brie might get cast as an older lara croft....
look on the positive side... we are going to see just how popular unpopular brie is with audiences.... you take a massively popular franchise like fatf and see just how much brie effects sales.
I agree. if I stopped watching movies because stuff actors say. I d be watching nothing. all I care about is entertainment. dont care about actors opinions. thats their business
so charlize theron being in these movies is ok ! the crazy woman that dresses her son as a girl and call ppl mask holes for not wearing mask. she says all types of crazy things. ppl pick n choose
I think sales will be fine. the majority of fast n furious fans are not angry over a casting of brie larson not everyone cares about that crap. I only seen a little bit of hate. a small minority of ppl. she has a bunch of youtube subscribers and twitter followers. and Im sure mcu fans will watch. its marketing. jason mamoa was also added. many upset claim they been done with fast movies anyway.
gotta love these headlines going  captain marvel is in fast and furious 10!  uh  its brie larson  but thanks  guys. also  this franchise prolly should ve relaxed after fast five. maybe 6.lara croft for fast 11 c mon vin.  d
17 25 - 18 10 - amen! dang straight!
clown franchise adds a new clown perfect match.
you are amazing lady
the way I see it  the road to heaven is such a narrow road that I wouldn t dare risk it without Jesus and I wouldn t recommend it  going alone  for anyone seeking the same. thank you for not sugar coating matters of salvation. the best way ive heard itsaid before is if you wouldn t want Jesus in this life why would you want him in the next.
brie joined the fast saga to end it cause family.
two minutes without talking about tomb raider  madness! Imiss the old days where they made games for fun  not a political training simulator. as an example horizon  forbidden west got hella woke  sadly. hopefully game devs will realize the 0.3  of  wokies  thatscream on twitter aren t the ones buying their games and the game devs will start making cool games again. unlikey but a zim zir it-thing can dream  a hu-being  notice without the man in it  can dream. le sigh!   - rodel
I love your art
pray for brie I thinks she needs the love of our heavenly father and not care about pleasing people.
good. the series needed something to finally kill it.
why do I hear happy jeremy noises in the distance
not watching f10 or f11 anyway  in my opinion furious 7 is the true end to the franchise.
well I dont think it will kill the franchise but it isn t going to make them any more money.
our culture will be so much richer the day that we stop saying   hey  its all white dudes who are running things    Christian bale said.  whether that be hollywood  whether that be washington  you know. we re going to get  in hollywood  so much better films and so much more interesting stories being told and america will become the america that the rest of the world sees it as  that makes it unique that we recognize makes this such a beautiful  brilliant country.
final fantasy 7 remake was gorgeous as you d expect but showed square enix is one of the most money hungry companies ever   80 for not even 10  of a 20 year old game  add that pointless dlc and it was over  100 meaning in 30 years when they finally have released you ll be looking at  1k for a single remake.then they took out the entire strategy aspect of the game turning a strategy rpg into a hack and slash. 100  agree the entire thing was a waste of a beloved game.
well this will be a 10 car pile up wreck now.
stopped watching ff after the 7th installment. thank you brie for making it easy. is it me  or every video that melonie made always contained topics bout lara croft and tomb raider  I enjoyed classic tomb raider and not so much for the recent reboot series. but hopefully the new tomb raider revert back to the classic gameplay style...probably not going to happen..lol
dont freak out ...but I heard laura croft its going to be dom z mistress!
why   sad dunkey.gigan is still better than Godzilla.
hImelonie  I dont know if you know this or not.  but I am brie larson s white knight.  jeremy loves brie - like its borderline creepy.  so as the official global white knight of brie larson - may I say that I will finally watch the fast and the furious movies.  as they are now worthy of my time.and as always - all hail brie larson.
yes  bring in angelina jolie in this
plot twist  it actually is captain marvel and the fast and furious is now mcu canon due to the multiverse!
@g vnhtsm  hahahaha nah.
marvel needs to represent more than  a straight white guy   says spider-man actor tom holland  brie larson hardly the only actress speaking on this. chris evans and mark ruffalo speaks on these issues a lot. her comments not enough to make a thousand videos about her. many monetizing hate thats all this is and she s popular on these youtube channels. its grifting
brie larson is a model human being
not only is brie just an outright misandrist and narcissist  but she s also just a bland actress and completely unlikable as a person. she just happens to be very well connected.
fast   furious became irrelevant to me once itstopped being about cars and street racing.
Im willing to give her the benefit of the doubt for 2 reasons.a  this is vin diesel s baby. the franchise means a lot to him  especially after paul walker passed on. I highly doubt he s gonna let her  woke  it upb  brie can actually act and do a good job when she doesnt take herself too seriously. kong  skull island is probably the best film to compare this to  as fast 10 will also be an ensemble movie  and not one where she is the lead character
Christian bale has had enough of  white guys  running everything in hollywood and beyond. the actor stopped by aol build with his  hostiles  co-star rosamund pike and wes studI on december 18 and told the crowd that the reason he moved to the u.s. in the first place was because he wanted his kids to grow up in a  country of inclusion.  unfortunately  that ideal hasn t been too much of a reality.
haven t seen any fast since I think five. but twenty bucks says her character is going to be paul walker s character coming back as trans.
what happens to people that dont believe  easy  we throw his own words back upon judgement. judge not lest thee be judged they self. and as a libra born in the year of the dragon  oh boy can I be judgemental when I want to be.
so smart and pretty
fast and furious just seems like what friday the 13th was a few decades ago. you got the die hards that will just watch every movie because they like watching fast cars go fast. but  for most people  its ... meh. there is in Christian theology the theory of invincible ignorance. one traditionalist catholic I listen to on the channel sensus fidelium speaks on this when he believes his own father  in an instant before death  may have been shown by God the light and given one last chance to say yes to God. for we dont know what things weigh on a person s heart in this life  nor what their choice would be if the weight was lifted. it kind of echoes what was said in the verse in isaiah. certainly  with family members  especially between father and son  daughter and mother  we do worry about them most of all  on whether they re saved  what to do when facing the conflict of differences that bring out moral dilemmas. we can gro weary in this worry and wonder if we struggle in vain to try to get them to church  or try to listen or understand something you feel is profound and share it with them  only for them to walk away  or close their ears  or at least seem to not pay attention. but we too sometimes forget how mighty God is  that he could even convert a thief before himself dying on a cross along with that thief. so we do have to trust in God and his plan.
if someone is willing to pay your fine  but youre not willing to accept it  then you have to pay it yourself. Christ has already paid for our sins and those who dont accept that payment wont be forgiven.
fast and furious 10 the chase for the nft vaults lol
Jesus said to him   I am the way  and the truth  and the life. no one comes to the father except through me. john 14 6its pretty simple  the Bible is the ikea instructions for your life. follow the instructions.
didn t she like begged to get into the franchise though  ! like she was really desperate to get into the franchise according to an article written by screenrant like weeks ago. Imean not that Im much interested in the franchise anymore anyways!
the first fast and the furious to lose money!
how many roles has she groveled for lately
they are still kicking the horse I see.
lol I didn t even see the last one
I dont have high hopes.
if you see mozza in here call him a prock chog
isaiah 40 31 is my favorite verse!
so this casting shouldn t bother you then!
I agree. I feel many overreacting to brie larson but she s content gold so I get it. tom holland and Christian bale both made similar  white dude  comments. its not that deep. thats why I believe the brie larson outrage is manufactured. almost like trumps both gave reasons for ppl to be upset but not 100 videos worth of upset. brie larson far from the worst in hollywood. chris evans mark ruffalo gal gadot and many others have shared opinions. heck I see many praising mel gibson. it all proves this is manufactured. they even got pplhating on her looks. its ridiculous.
@kicknowledge smith  to me  its because it wasn t just a one-time thing. she had the weird comments about white men  had weird moments with mcu costars   thank you very much!  that one still makes me chuckle.   plus she starred in the meh captain marvel which was the mcu s wokest feeling movie at time of release with mostly wooden acting as a poor attempt at the mcu s answer to wonder woman when everyone wanted a black widow movie  at the time   with said movie being strangely  but brilliantly by marketing  sandwiched between infinity war and endgame  despite it feeling like needless post- infinity war dlc rather than a necessary plot addition for endgame .also  Im not mad  its just that people s dislike of or distaste for brie larson is kind of multi-faceted. it didn t just come from nowhere. whether or not its overblown is purely subjective  though.
I hear you and appreciate your feedback. I just feel she s popular on certain channels. many have said comments about white dudes. I dont remember any other comments from her regarding thatsubject in that manner. chris evans and mark ruffalo has twitter comments full of that type stuff. jason mamoa told trumpsupporters dont bother following him on twitter. I can go all day. brie larson is just content gold. its manufactured just like the hate for trump. yes they both said controversial things but not enough to warrant the amount of hate and outrage. its to the point ppl are calling her ugly which is bs. its cool to dislike her but many turning into sjws they claim to hate over this woman. dont like her movies just skip them. many upset dont even watch fast n furious movies. wanting this woman cancelled is hypocrisy. making 100s of videos on her is overblown and borderline sick. also that clip of her saying white dudes was her first quote on quote offense and tons of videos of her followed. it all started with her being announced as captain marvel and said to be the most powerful in the mcu. then many ran to rotten tomatoes and selected do not want to see. its personal with this woman. many of the same people praise actors like mel gibson.  gal gadot said if your not a feminist youre a sexist. tom holland said marvel needs to cast more than just straight white dudes. many ran to see no way home no problem. holland says a bunch of stuff
@kicknowledge smith  I hear what youre saying. I just think  like Imentioned above  it was the back to back nature of what she said and did and represented portrayed with captain marvel. with other people  its generally more of a one and done. with tom holland  he made that comment  which I have seen videos about saying it was dumb   but  from what Ive seen  there was no weird dumb follow up action statements. brie larson had a lot of weird moments in a row  starting with the white men statement like you said   so that people could make numerous videos on her. plus she has an annoying way of emphasizing thatshe is annoyed irritated by something  like if she doesnt like something she wants you to know without a doubt  again   thank you very much!  comes to mind . and there s a feeling that her recent less annoying things are just pr moves because of the seeming wave of weird annoying statements in the past. I personally liked her in kong  skull island too  but her run of weird statements actions kind of turned me off to her likr with others. am I now boycotting her  no. but I d be lying if I said her inclusion in something made me more inclined toward a particular movie project  probably a bit of the opposite. now have others done more than I personally would have  definitely. does that make it necessarily too much to me  maybe sometimes  I d have to take it on a case by case  but not necessarily.
I hear you. good points. I feel like grown men crying over this is beta male behavior and sjw behavior. sjws they claim to hate. its no different than twitter. its ok to dislike her but she not even the worst of the worst in hollywood. there are actors who have gotten in legal troubles thar dont get this type hate. I think many secretly have a crush on her. some are jealous and some just monetizing hate and outrage. I watched some of her content she s not that bad. and has some cool moments. Im a fan of fast n furious and not letting a casting stop me from enjoying it. I just want ppl to be consistent. many quote her  40yr old white dude  remarks. thats the focus when it comes to her. she s a woman on top of itso holland and Christian bale gets a pass. she was said to be the most powerful and many already hated her for that. she said it in an interview after fiege announced it then the video surfaced of her comments. thats why I say manufactured. their more tI the madness than just her comments
@kicknowledge smith   sorry  I forgot to respond to this  Imean  its possible that those people exist who  dislike her for superficial reasons  but I haven t seen people who I believe dislike her because they like her or are jealous or she was a woman on top. but it could be that youre just seeing different videos comments that I haven t seen. most criticism Ive seen mostly stems from what Imentioned above. Imentioned tom holland already  Christian bale is beloved for the dark knight trilogy and playing batman  and I haven t heard a string of weird comments from him either. even gal gadot  who people talk about for the  imagine  singing montage gets credit for when she was saying wonder woman isn t  just for girls   the opposite  obviously  of what brie larson said . plus gal gadot seems like a generally happy  smiling person who gives off positive vibes. brie larson kind of gives off the opposite vibe  she comes off as smug  arrogant  and kind of fake  qualities which obviously aren t very likeable. and I dont blame you for wanting to see f10 if you like the franchise. for me  Ive missed the last movie or 2  so I wasn t going to be rushing out to see the new one. Im just saying brie larson s casting adds zero extra motivation  probably a slight negative  but I d have to see her character in trailers   and I dont personally blame people who are turned off by her addition. her casting addition  for me  conjures thoughts of a smug  arrogant character  like captain marvel or her own personality . maybe she ll play someone fun and likeable  but I d personally need to see evidence before I d be attracted to the movie by her casting. I imagine others feel the same.
@the royal mediator  I hear you and you make some good points. I posted comments from other actors below  they all say things  I ignore them and focus on entertainment. Christian bale has had enough of  white guys  running everything in hollywood and beyond.tom holland marvel universe needs more racially diverse characters besides  straight white guys. gal gadot wants to remind everyone that if you aren t feminist  you are sexist. and no  thats not just  leftist  radicals trying to make you drink some koolaid  its a real concern she says.
@kicknowledge smith  to be honest  I dont discount that these actors have said things. I know of some of them and I think I remember hearing of some of the others. I think all of them go on a case by case basis in terms of fan response outrage  but I really think brie larson was hurt because she wasn t yet beloved for a certain role  I d only really known her in her supporting king kong role  which I liked  despite her not being a standout   like the others  batman  spider-man  wonder woman in great most liked movies . also  brie larson had thatstring of weird strange comments where it felt like she thought she was more important beloved than she was  the white men comments  her seemingly prickly nature with chris hemsworth   don cheadle   her wooden unlikable performance as captain marvel  which seemed to match her personality outside the movie   and marvel s decision to try to push her forward despite the perception thatshe came out of nowhere hadn t earned her spot and wasn t likable  the former not necessarily being her fault  but itstill didn t help her image . obviously I cant speak for everyone  but thats what Ive gathered.
@the royal mediator  yea I hear you good points  but the  white dude  comments is what started all the videos about her. she became popular content for youtubers. so everything she says and does was under a microscope. thats why many covering her being in fast 10  she s content gold.  many wanted to hate her anyway because fiege said captain marvel will be the most powerful. brie larson also said this in an interview  thatshe is the most powerful and could beat thor and lift his hammer or something to that affect.  then her white dudes comments surfaced. the videos started and they ran to rt to select do not want to see. they wanted her cancelled. thats the bottom line. she did provide some of the ammunition for them to hate. I look at trump situation the same way. many amplified the hate towards him even though he did provide ammo. but alot of the hate is over exaggerated. biden made racial comments and was accused of assault and accused of making women uncomfortable. just like Christian bale  tom holland  and many other made comments about white men and act snobby just like many say brie larson does. bale had a melt down on the set with a light man  if I recall while shooting terminator salvation. like brie larson or not she s winning. she s now part of two billionaire dollar franchises. her movie made a billion   whether people think itsucked or not. I thought it was meh personally  but mcu has a variety of content for everyone  that one wasn t my cup of tea. hopefully the marvels is better. jason mamoa is going to be in fast 10 also and he told trump supporters to un follow him. again it comes down to bias. many like mamoa so he will get a pass  same with holland and bale. which proves brie larson comments not really the issue. they just hate her and use that as an excuse to do so. just my thoughts
most youtubers beg for subs
no evidence proves she begged. she wanted to play in these movies just like many other actresses post their job interest for roles on their social medias. kathryn winnick wanted to play captain marvel. alexandria daddario and angie hamon wanted to play she hulk and many more examples. they would post pictures in those costumes on their social medias. doesnt mean you will get the job. vin contacted brie larson. this brie larson hate is ridiculous. where s this energy for tom holland gal gadot and Christian bale  ! thats how you know this outrage is bstom holland said this marvel needs to represent more than  a straight white guy   says spider-man actor tom hollandgal gadot said this gal gadot gets real   if you aren t feminist  youre sexist Christian bale said this Christian bale has had enough of  white guys  running everything in hollywood and beyond.this all proves its just for content with brie she s content gold for youtubers.
she groveling  ! wow. many actors on record wanting to play certain characters and posting it on their social medias trying to get directors and studios attention. kathryn winnick was trying to play captain marvel for years. always speaking. on it thats just one example. especially when it comes to comic book stuff many on record wanting roles
@kicknowledge smith  I get that  but she was also begging publicly to be in a star wars movie  etc.
@crow at the sol  I hear you nothing against you. thanks for your response. Im just saying she not alone in this. many actors lobby for roles. she wanted to be in fast n furious  she asked and she received. I wish I could get a job like this. Im sure many do. fans also beg to have certain actors cast in movies. many wanted allison brie as she hulk  many also wanted gina carano. all good.
sirI  what is the definition of  failure  sirI  anything brie larson is in
12 50 yeah  why cant people stop judging.  I was babysitting an affectionate toddler and someone made the comment  I dont see the resemblance .  I have to admit I had trepidation s spending time with my best friend since 1st grade unless we are with his wife.
good game lmao.
I brie s character dies in a fiery explosion  I ll make some popcorn.
wait there s ten movies
rrreeeee larson. poor vin-vin s gonna get slapped unless he props her up.
I didn t watch the last one because of john cina so it will be easy to skip this one too
dantes divine comedy.
what     nooooo!!!!!
melonie good to see you what s your thoughts on tombraider 2018 film I thought is one of better video game movie
I have a bad feeling about this.
fast and furious 9 broke the franchise while ff10 will be a walking corpse thats just my assessment.
its called  failing up .
I can only speak for myself but they should ve ended the series after paul walker s death. but thankfully 10 will be the last.
not like it could get any worse....
they are still making fast and furious movies  I think I stopped on 4.
is her voice getting squeakier  intentionally
yeah Im pretty sure he knows its going to fail so he s bringing her in so they can blame it on brie and not the fact that its the 10th movie that nobody asked for
cool
Imean  I ain t mad thatshe s in the movie. Im just flabbergasted thatshe s even in this franchise now. well  I dont expect much from fast 10 anyway. these films may be dumb fun popcorn flicks  but f9 wasn t that good imo. it went too far with all the batshit crazy stunts. hell I thought furious 8 and hobbs and shaw were better than 9.
well captain marvel made a billion and universal thought dollar signs when  casting her so sirI lied. she s also content gold for youtubers making them money
@kicknowledge smith  defending larson has to be the hottest take Ive seen in 2022. its up there with dr. death s plea for masks again.
@elban19  look Im not the biggest brie larson fan but this crap is beyond ridiculous at this point  sorry Im  not writing a mean comment about her that makes you happy!
@kicknowledge smith  I get it. youre into her feet.
@elban19  what ! smh lol
Christian bale has had enough of  white guys  running everything in hollywood and beyond. the actor stopped by aol build with his  hostiles  co-star rosamund pike and wes studI on december 18 and told the crowd that the reason he moved to the u.s. in the first place was because he wanted his kids to grow up in a  country of inclusion.  unfortunately  that ideal hasn t been too much of a reality.
sad
well its either that or they re trying to get people to talk about the movie through the brie larson hate
fast died when paul walker died...
honestly  I couldn t care less about f f or brie larson. Im just here for the tomb raider tangents.
lethal lightning likes his bre larsson lol what a prock chog
hey melonie I just want to say that I dont think that brie larson will not be that good actress for the upcoming fast and furious 10 movie for next year. anyway brie larson was okay in the captain marvel movie but I was not a fan of her and her movies  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say that brie larson will not be a good for upcoming fast and furious movie and I hope you agree with me on this topic  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
fast and furious should have ended after 6.
I will skip that thing.
commenting to feed the algorithm
melone    if I dont believe in Jesus do I still go to heaven   ...... no no  Jesus is the only way me as a muslim watching this
hopefully she took some acting classes...
the fast   furious franchise should ve ended with the 7th movie in my opinion itseems like now they are milking the franchise for all they can get out of it   of all the people they could ve gotten to be in the movie why they picked brie larson I will never know it was a dumb decision in my opinion
wow brie going to be in the next fast movie that good to know now I can skip it  I would rather watch paint dry then the watch her in another movie.
imho  a fast   furious movie with  breezy  larson will become flat   superfluous.  btw  I like to refer to her as breezy.  why    because of this airplane   https   en.m.wikipedia.org wikI rlu-1_breezy yes  it is a real airplane.  yes  it really flies.  but there is just not that much to it.   the difference between an rlu-1 and ms. larson is one day I would love love love to take a ride on an rlu-1.  really.
paula walker
people that dont like your content should run their own channels and stho.
just a marketing ploy. she s in car commercials. they re just trying to sell more. personally I think she should sell cheese instead. though the cheese might sell itself better anyways. its less offensive  preaches less  can act better  and likely smells better.okay  okay  I guess she can just sell cars. even if I were on the line about what car to buy  I d purposely go away from any thatshe endorsed.
its seems like a marketing ploy to get someone people do not like to talk about an overdone franchise
brie farted hence the laughs.
you should make a discord
I thought it was done and dusted  of all the people why the moderately entertaining larson
we all need to make an effort to stop talking about brie larson. its the only way to make her irrelevant!
2
@wet in cornwall  disagree
nope. 7 and 8 were awesome
she s got one.
@sygos  what is it
a definition I heard recently of hell is to be without God. whereas heaven is to be with God.
bwahahahahahahahah that avengers meme was hilarious! the attack on titan meme was funny as well. I hate brie larson but I dont care thatshe is in this movie  and if she makes the movie not do well in theaters then so be it and if she is the catalyst for the franchise ending then so be it because this franchise should have ended a very long time ago  lol.
she got cancelled
honestly this is just another of many reasons not to watch it. the franchise has been going downhill for a long time. dwayne saw to that.
I loved these movies  but Im done now that brie larson has infected the franchise with her disease.  she is going to be brian o connor  paul walker   he had a sex change.
vin diesel is such a beta he wanted the rock back for fast 10 even using emotional blackmail by bringing up paul walker and because he couldn t dwayne he goes and gets everyone s favourite man hater captain f n marvel   this franchise should have died with furious 7 now they just milking this garbage
make sure she does her own stunts.can someone find out if this film is made for 40yr old white men before I go to see it as I dont want to upset brie if it isn t
Ive watched every single fast   furious since the beginning   own all of them until 9. Ive never been a fan of john cena   when I saw him apologizing to china over calling taiwan a country  I was done with the franchise. he s a ccp puppet.
hell  what a concept that many people believe is either made up or a party with all their friends. well they are all in for a rude awakening. also with many people who say they are Christian.  because just because people say God is not real  does not change the  fact that he is! same goes for hell.  there are soooo many seeker churches out there. david wilkerson say one time  many preachers do not preach the one true gospel. they are afraid if they did people would leave along with their checkbooks.
Christian bale says hollywood  and the world  would be better if  white dudes  weren t in charge of everything the actor says there would be  so much better films and so much more interesting stories  if white dudes weren t running hollywood. zack sharf dec 19  2017
Im almost looking forward to seeing how they ll turn fast and furious into woke garbage.  and  for the record  I do not just hate captain marvel.  it was bad but I hate brie larson for plenty of other reasons.  she s a sh tty person and drags everyone down with her.  I d put money on the fact thatshe s going to use that image to  metoo vin diesel  saying how horrible it was to for him to touch her.
oh no
noooo
brie larson is a terrible person  and the f f franchise stopped being f f after the third movie. its just an over the top action franchise that might feature some cool cars for approximately 10 minutes of the run time. gone are the days when it was actually about the cars or culture.
Christian bale says hollywood  and the world  would be better if  white dudes  weren t in charge of everything the actor says there would be  so much better films and so much more interesting stories  if white dudes weren t running hollywood. zack sharf dec 19  2017
they re still making fast   furious movies!  this franchise should have died 10 years ago.
brie larson is flat and furious.
fast and furious movies have had pretty awesome action scenes despite some of their confusing storylines.on lara croft  I only know classic lara and a little bit of another one from a couple hours worth of gameplay. I think this is alright since you can fill me in on all the later games and storylines if you get bored. saw a couple of the movies. they were fun. keep up the hard journalism work.
dead on arrival. anyone who knows lucas black  guy who played sean from tokyo drift  knows that if those 2 ever share scenes  lucas ain t going to take any shit from this weirdo. lucas is quite based and red pilled.
and the franchise finally dies
she didn t. she s in the marvels and fast 10. and has a cameo end creditscene in shang chI and has nissan comments. no one is canceled. thats social media nonsense. its ok to be unhappy about this but there are many happy about the casting
stop it he got jason mamoa too and the actress that played rat catcher in suicide squad. its k to not be happy about it but this brie larson hate is overblown. if ppl really cared they be going after tom holland Christian bale gal gadot chris evans and many more that made similar comments
@kicknowledge smith   why you simping for brie larson
true mate. fast furious is a rubbish cartoon now.
ps I haven t seen all the fast and furious movies but Ive seen a bunch of them.
so what the dead horse wasn t kicked enough. you gotta get that black hole of an  actor  to kick it round some more   meh  entertainment  is trash nowadays anyway. I ll stick to movies from the 90 s and back to the 1920 s  you can keep these modern movies and tv shows
brie larson is the epitome of cringe.
brie piggybacks off another successful franchise nearing the end of its life just like  she did with avengers. no matter how much hollywood pushes this radical feminist brie   I will never support her. fast furious is a rubbish cartoon franchise anyway.
thing is when Jesus said I am the only way to God I am the only way to the kingdom of heaven he did not litteraly mean himself what he ment was be like me meaning follow the path of the Christ and you wil find the path to God and heaven.you gotta understand that Christ is not a title given to only him Christ is actualy a spiritual state of beeing the Christ energie means to walk in compassion and love for all arround you to the best of youre ability and he achieved that.Jesus said I am not the only one who can do all these things you canto for I am no diffirent then you are he is the son of God but make no mistake we are all the sons and daughters of God.wel its upto youre own judgement what you deserve but al the good at heart people deserve and wil go to the kingdom of heaven did Jesus on the cross not say to the thief next to him I wil see you in the kingdom of God my brother.
fast and furious should have ended years ago  but Im not gonna lie I did enjoy watching the ridiculous things they keep doing in these movies.. mindless fun to forget how crappy life is getting. not gonna watch fast 10 with that dumb bimbo in it. thank God its finally dead now.
brie larson  ewwwww
family
vin  vin  vin why  such absolute bs that very few are going to believe. I dont know what the  agenda  is here but
picture looks nice and good poetic text but like you said I have come to know  and realize that most of all these things are fake I can only hope this picture and text is actualy based on truth.got nothing against brie some of her charcs are cool I like captain marvel but if you follow her you tube channel wel she is abit of a boring person realy.and wel technicly beeing a tomb raider isnt actualy a bad thing Imean the person is dead and annything left in the tomb is just sitting there going to waste dead people that are with God have no use for material stuf you cant realy steal from dead people.I get that there is a culture of respecting the dead but wel what does it realy do it just makes us waste materials by leaving them with the dead.
brie is awful
I hate these movies  they ruined real street racing. now that bree is in it  I definitely wont watch it. she s a bad actress.
what is fast and furious  you talking about bruce lee  lol. I guess vin never heard the brie state about one film and I am sure she meant it for all of the films she is in. the movie is not made for over 40 year old white dudes! now looking at that pick of vin and brie  they probably had some devil s lettuce
hollywood is a joke and films like coda  nomadland  parasite etc are much better in terms of entertainment. avengers endgame was a below average film that only exist to make money as do many hollywood productions. I simply dont remember them so I dont watch them as its a waste of time.
Im glad because I hate this franchise
I thought we hated cancel culture  so why are we still trying to cancel culture brie larson 5 years on
I dont watch these movies. they re boring and lame. I dont care who they put in their movies since they re not made for me
lol!! Im sorry but they need to retire this crap. the last  fast  was so stupid  a pinto   or something like it   in space  eeeeesh!
