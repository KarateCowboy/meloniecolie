imagine having the gall to verbally assault someone and then say they felt unsafe. if you felt unsafe you wouldn t have said anything to him in the first place.
theron  aggressively gets in hardy s face cussing him outhardy   what d you say to me  theron  Im a victim!typical
imagine all the energy charlize put into cussing tom out when all she got in return was a  what did you say.
I cantell you why she wanted a woman -  a woman would side with her. charlize wanted someone in her corner. we women like to emotionally vent a problem before we solve it  we like to feel validated in our emotions. guys are more action oriented  they want to solve the problem  then deal w the emotional stuff later. a man would no doubt protect her  but he may not take her side in the conflict  or validate her feelings on the matter.  note  Im speaking in generalities  I am well aware that individuals dont always behave in the ways I have described. thank you.
and you ve just got to love theron s logic here  Im gonna scream and swear in this dude s face but then claim he makes me feel unsafe when he reacts in kind instead of simply cowering in fear at my awesome fury  classic double standard  . Ive seen this kind of thing happen quite a bit lately  why is this a thing  if you act aggressive with people you run the risk of triggering an aggressive reaction from someone sooner or later  not everyone will just back down. if you cant cope with that reality it might be a good idea to dial down your own aggression.
wow  imagine yelling at someone and then feeling unsafe and crying attack when they yell back.
tom hardy s responses in interviews are hilarious. he s the no nonsense type of british.
if someone cant handle a man walking up angrily saying  what d you say to me   then perhaps she shouldn t cuss him out in the first place. he should ve been on time  but she is his coworker and does not have the job authority for him to defer to her.
me thinks ms. theron has a selective memory. I have been in my fair share of fights  verbal and physical . youreally cant get up in someone s face  clearly be the aggressor  and then claim you were  threatened . if she felt threatened  she likely would have been more guarded in her approach towards him. she started a confrontation because she was angry at his tardiness disrespect for others  time  and then ran to the producers like a damsel in distress.
this seems like a distraction from her being called a hypocrite during her maskless super bowl attendance.
emotional support producer  is a time-honored position for all insecure actors.
so wait  wait wait wait wait waitshe got up and started yelling at a guy  threw herself bodily at him and was acting in a very provocative manner...and because he reciprocated that manner to hershe felt threatened...thats what Im seeing here right  a woman - again - complaining that a man is willing to go  y know what okay.  and treating her the way she treats him. if I have to say it once I have to say it a million times  dont talk shit if you dont wanna get hit.
tom has been known for being intimidating on set. that being said  charlize seems like she has a massive ego. I honestly think it is just a case of two big egos going at it on set. she started it and didn t realize she bit off more than she could chew. dont mess with the tom hardy bull.
hardy plays some tough as nails characters in films but he gives off a really gentleman-y vibe in interviews  even when he responded to an interviewer talking about homosexuality and stuff  he responded cordially but also very directly as he wanted to make sure that he wasn t being dragged through the media from a panel question.  he s the definition of someone who sheathes their shadow and would only use it in times of absolute necessity.  definitely a superb actor as well.
lol  what did you say  I can see tom hardy saying this.
I have to laugh at the whole  I want to be equal to a man  vibe thatsome women give off  then when the guy treats you as an equal you cry victim. if I had someone come at me all aggressively  get in my face and scream at me  then Im screaming back. I consider that a threat and I will act accordingly. tom seems like he did a better job at reacting to her hostility though .the more things come out about these celebrities  the more I cant stand them.
this is old news really. its long been known that they did not get on and when they finished filming  tom gave her a handpainted picture and on the back  itsaid  you are an absolute nightmare  but you are also fucking awesome. I ll kind of miss you. love  tommy. according to her  she was unsure of the painting and their time making mad max  but after a bit  she hung it in her office.
so she comes screaming and cussing at the guy and when he didn t immediately crumble and fold  but rather placidly challenges her attitude  she feels  unsafe .I dont know if the article deliberately tried to paint that picture  but she comes across as very unstable.
from what I cantell  some people like charlize just have no self awareness. everything. everything. is filtered through a lens of  me  me and me . they are fundamentally incapable of empathizing with other human beings and their own emotional filter is one-way only.expecting them to reflect on their actions is futile as they are literally cannot do it. they are run by emotion  their emotions dictate the  truth   as in  if they  feel  something  then that feeling must always be based on something real.a silly example can be made -a child eats a cookie from their own personal cookie jar every day after school-they come home one day and there is no cookie jar-they start crying-they remember their sibling moving the cookie jar to clean the counter top that very morning-ahah! the sibling must have stolen the cookies!-they confront their sibling  accusing them of cookie theft  the most serious of crimes -the sibling remembers they just moved the cookie jar into the pantry during the cleaning and forgot to take it outnow  how would a person like charlize take this  do you think she would calm down  apologize  yeah  I didn t think so  either.
the healer class is the most stealth op class in any game.  Ive played so many strategy games where I thought I would steamroll the enemy and the healer basically f ed my plans up and I ended up dying.  its true  the first target in most games against someone else is to target the healer.
its all a pr stunt. check into what she is being criticized for and what she wants distracted from.
well of course  she s a strong woman
@le radmuiel  doesnt hurt that this story gets the new furiosa prequel a lot of buzz  currently filming.
bahahaha for real
acts like a tough guyreceives equivalent reciprocationI see no issue
no kidding. she spent 3 hours stewing while waiting for tom and his lack of response made her even angrier xd
average feminist.
I get the feeling he views himself as an artist and not an entertainer  and finds the hollywood circus to be a necessary evil
@aaron burdon idk about  wildly expensive  so much as moderately aggravating. three hours of what could potentially be a 15  hour day is not really that big of a deal.
@aaron burdon I haven t heard anything about costs. or producers complaining. usually experienced directors know how to be efficient when shooting. if you cant shoot a certain scene at that time for whatever reason you can decide to do another one.
I think youre right.
@iowa dan  yep.
but she s an ac-tress  she s allowed to not wear a mask. we re just the little people  we re supposed to follow the rules these great people put in place for us but dont follow. its only fair. Imean  they pretend to be someone else for a living. they deserve to be treated differently than us. dontcha know
tom started it after he left an entire crew waiting 3 hours and not even apologising or acknowledging it. I like tom hardy a lot  but he was the asshole in this situation. charlize definitely isn t in the right either and shouldn t have spoken to him like that though. both of them behaved pretty badly imo. the producers also seem pretty shitty for not approaching him about it either if he is always late leave an entire crew waiting.
@ritualblood Ive done some work on set and a 3 hour delay for one reason or another is almost expected on any given day. he didn t  start  anything by being late  dont blame the victim  of her anger and her the media trying to paint him as dangerous or whatever . she was out of line for talking to him the way she did. period. they are coworkers  he is not her subordinate.
maybe it was venom
@melonie mac go boom  the way charlize theron described him  itseemed like he wanted a pile a bodies and a pile of heads
ok  I absolutely hate being late.  I hate it when other people are late.  having hardy hold up the whole production for 3 hours is not okay.  someone definitely needed to correct this behavior.  thatsaid  if you put your foot down  you are stepping on someone.  do be surprised if they dont take it well.  if you want to have a pointed conversation with someone about punctuality  it is reasonable to expect them to have a conversation.  if you aggressively attack them  even verbally   and they come back at you in kind  dont go crying  mommy  tell bobby to stop hitting me back.
side note  I hate drama in my work place. I learned after being a manager that I especially hate working with younger women. some people just thrive on attention I guess
so you jump out and start yelling and gesturing wildly at him  how did she expect for him to respond
fury road in probably the best action movie in the past 20 years  and hands down the best movie charlize theron has ever been in. itseems to me thatshe s confusing the terms  threatened  vs.  intimidated . if you cant deal with working with intimidating people thats on you. grow thicker skin. now as for cole train - looking forward to his hollywood debut in mad cat furry road. make it happen!
you have a big heart melonie  your faith and dedication to your health and your subs is what makes you unique. God bless you my friend.
with one of my instructors at mediatech he does mention thatstars will do this sometimes and its completely a total pain the silver lining is that even if you dont shoot the day and youre on the set and getting paid for it you still get your pay
according to the stories  she describes it as   traded blows.  which usually translates to   I hit him.
awww look at cole train. he wants to hangout with melonie mac go boom.
Im a bit of a mad max fan and for me after mad max 2 I wondered where they were going with this. and I just sat there shaking my head all the way through fury. each to their own I guess.
your videos are very organized. when you go on fright night tights you should mention to ryan that you could teach him out to be more organized  and mention how many tabs he keeps open on his browser is terrifying.
charlize theron let her 3 year old adopted son pick his gender because one day he exclaimed  I am not a boy!    its my opinion that the environment which he is being raised in has no strong masculine example which he can look up too. probably due to the fact thatshe witnessed her mother shoot and kill her father after her father attacked them both. pretty sure she has a deep contempt of men due to that traumatic event when she was a child.
off topic for a second - has anybody complimented you on how cool your new channels name is   melanie mac go boom  is just a perfect badass title for this new place where you can say what you want and really be yourself - and so far  its been a blast!Ive enjoyed your other channel for years - but in this one  it really seems like the place where you seem the most relaxed and the most at home.and where you are now having the most fun!guess youreally are enjoying being finally unleashed with no holding back - and saying what s really been on your mind about all these other real world topics!keep up the great work - its been a lot of fun seeing this brand new side of you!
clearly  charlize hasn t met a man that told her  no  in 30  years  so she got a little upset  p
the mad max road warrior franchise is one of my favorites. very few remakes of old classics have done much to improve the original. red dawn is a good example itsucked. planet of the apes Im mixed on. lost in space from the 90s was a surprise. Im really ready to see some new original content instead of rehashed old movies and tv series. even anime is getting a bitstale.
watching this from the office at work and bro  this is so spot on about diet  about what happened to the classic video game charm that Ive just been missing for a fat fat minute here  and the scripture of philipeans  really well done and grateful for this community carnovoire diet  with keto days weeks mingled with water fasting helped me lose so much weight while I was away from home for a church  went from 240 to 167 in 8 months so I know its helpful and works  also worked out too so that helps. ill admit I had a hard time getting tossed around in the sea and waves of information about different diets  being a slave to my cravings and also rigid eating plans and what not... when you find your stride tho  food feels like a blessing a great blessing  we ll all make it    Im certain the woke preassure has made my favorite game warcraft what it is today  unfotunately... that games soul feels so burried under their agenda and biasdes that the games anatomy is stunted and has been for sometime. of course  its had its issues before this  but it has definetly made itso much worst off because of their fixation on shuving their opinions down our throats through a game people love. I hope we will see a return to video games getting that classic charm they used to soon. thanks again for your content and opinions  melonie!
I think gaming-wise  it has lead to that.  it even affects conventions a lot too.  comic con and anime expo hasn t been the same once the corpos took over.
tom hardy from what I remember when the film was in production was having fights with george about the film and the direction it was taking  like he didnt believe in it and actually apologized to george when the film came out and he saw the result  so this might have been something concussive of that that boiled over  and also your in the middle of nambu in africa  as broken hill had actually had a ton of rain storms that turned that place into a not desert  that forced them to relocate to there an that kind of shoot was probably tough on everyoneand she was probably like oh crap did I add onto that by doing this  and maybe wanted the woman there to talk to to calm her down so she didnt disrupt it like tom was doing  as that is the thing about productions  their hell on everyone  and in reality the worst part about this modern age is everyone is afraid of putting in the work that would have that as a focal point  those kind of conflicts and fights amongst the crewbut the result is a great movie  Imean hell young frankenstein was a case study of that kind of a shoot reallyas your asking a ton of pretenders with varrying ego s  comfort levels  lines and ways of studying the work and the lines to work with the director with all the same production issues ramped up to 11with a production crew and the like and asking them all to work together  and hoping for the best  and conflict is almost natural  especially if the shoot is in a foreign location with high heat levels in the middle of a desertand its why you see these film making groups and these cliques of actors and directors and producers always working together  because they work well together and dont derail each otherthe sad part is they ve so focused in on these ego s and comfort levels that no one puts in the work anymore  and they expect a billion dollar winner from the least amount of worklike they ve come complacent  which is why honestly the best films that have come out in the past 10 years have all been by stuntmen turned movie makers with the john wick series honestly.who know hey it aint gonna be perfect and you can always do better  and always be open to the criticism  which is like a 0.01 percent of hollywood now.
oh yes  the cowardly victim card
what d you say to me !  tom said calmly.
me  tell me youre a gamergirl  without telling me youre a gamergirlmel  I need you guys to carry me for 3 weeks....
monster was pretty good too.
being into cars I was always a fan of the the first 2 movies as a kid  the 3rd was meh  kind of a separate movie. fury road was so over the top with the vehicle builds it lost the gritty realness  became a parody of itself.
back then she said they didn t like one another and claimed the movie was better for it. he wrote her letter apologizing for the differences in personality.nothing about that came out then and now suddenly when she writes a book this all happened.but even if this happened Imean what are you supposed to say to someone cussing and swearing at you
contractor yelling at a contractor  you get shipped off of most sites for that behavior. you dont usually get to play the victim after going outside of the chain of command  regardless of gender
he may have been hard to deal with and late to the job but thats no reason to cause drama and a conflict. if you dont like what another employee is doing at your job you should notify the managers supervisors  human resources or the administrator. employee handbook 101  when you get one read it.
if furiosa came charging at me I would have acted aggressively too. then again lateness is one of my pet peeves.  I am never late unless there is something major happening. edit  got a starter kit and a tub with a flavor that looks tasty. gl with the contest.
I find the story to be false thatshe felt that threatened from tom yelling back at her  Imean she did kill her drunken dad in a shootout as a child unless she was truly triggered by the yelling
imagine being a successful woman and not wanting to be known. my life in a nutshell. also played coh cov and was a beta tester for that game. favorite toons were my emp rad defender and my invul ss tank. and my emp was always on a team as soon as I logged on.
I guess I need to rewatch fury road  I haven t seen itsince it came out. I remember I liked it but right when I thought the movie was really getting started it ended. I guess Ive seen the original movies too and they drag on forever but I definitely thought fury was too short. the mad max game was good
drops the c word acting verbally aggressive towards someone then cries about feeling unsafe.
was hardy talking like bane the whole time   I didn t see the clock until I was already a man  and by then time was nothing to me but blinding!
it is hilarious that melanie mac named her cat coal train!
hImelonie I see your tranaling a kick butt lara croft on today s video lol.Ive really enjoyed that movie aswell.Ive didn t know charlize had that problem.its great seeing your doing things you want to tell on any topics.God bless you takecare melonie
here s the thing for the mad max story  please apologize for my english  Im not from an english speaking country and Im not living in an english speaking country either   people often confuse being legitimate to retaliate with being protected from the consequences of the retaliation.hardy acted was an asshole for having 3 hours late  and have no defense for not apologize.theron was legitimate to yell at him and did it but she wasn t ready to face the consequences.if youre mad at someone you cantell it without yelling and or insulting that person.if youre insulting someone  get ready to face the fact you just escalated the situation.there s a say   dont make threat you cant hold.yelling insults at someone is a form a threat and the fact youre legit at being angry does not change anything at the fact youre yelling and insulting that person.never yell insults if youre not ready to face the consequences.this doesnt mean theron should have said nothing to voice her legit anger. it just means that if she wanted to yell insults at him she should have stand to it and face him. thats how you yell at someone. if he had answered with physical violence he would have to face the legal consequences.conclusion   if youre not ready to take a fist in your face  dont yell insults at someone.
she talked sh!t to someone  and got  scared  when they weren t putting up with it.
yeah I can imagine how hardy s presence would make the feeble minded feel intimidated.
this is fitting for me cuz I was just considering watching the movie
we see chicks do this all the time  they feel they get slighted by some guy while they re out of the club with their boyfriend  so they get irate and try to throw down knowing that their boyfriend or husband will come to their aid. its the whole  let s you and him fight! sounds like charlize theron is no different.
her best role will always be as rita leeds in arrested development  as for this story she should ve said  sorry my comments went over your head  just for the extra insult to his shortness.
she jumps in hardy s face and then says thatshe was scared. really ! you should think about your decision before you act on them.
you named your cat cole train !my God. its perfect.
so she jumped out at him and is the one that felt threatened   dont tug on supermans cape or when you want the bull you get the horns too
I threw scaffolding at the electrician  and almost choked him but I only got in trouble for yelling and swearing so whatever
ahhhh thank you so much!
hardy is a lot bigger than her and  while theron is very fit  she s nowhere near as strong or physically intimidating as hardy could be. she probably did feel threatened  but from the story she told that didn t cause her to back down.thatsaid  the director never should have allowed the situation to occur.
her mom killed her dad
bless anyone who plays a healer  woman or otherwise.
funnily enough tom hardy is like 5 9 so he s far from being tall himself
women are strong  brave and powerful. what did you say  help  I feel threatened!!!!
she wanted a sympathizer  not a protector. very clear thatshe d choose a woman producer to follow her around to act out victim status  because if it was about safety at all she d ask security or simply steer clear when they aren t sharing a scene. she s not accustomed to people who dont back down  so of course she immediately pivots to emotional blackmail when the confrontation didn t go how she planned.
if your not 15 minutes early your late. this is the military every time I showed up in time.
sounds like normal for a film set. she really should not feel threatened  not sure of her thought process. she instigated the intimidation   not of course excusing his tardiness  but we never knew the reason . I do not feel she would have gobbed off if she was the sort to get intimidated  by a shorter man returning the verbals.
used to play wow. healers were always in high demand. never appealed to me so I was always glad people liked to play that class. if it appeals more to women  so be it. complementarianism is important in life and video games.
feelings aren t facts.
lol cole train being a healer at the end as you finish the vid.
itsounds like both of them were in the wrong in thatsituation.
I totally understand why women choose to play healers or other support roles in games for the same reason that I play goalie in soccer and hockey. we know that people can depend on us and we can carry the weight of everyone on our shoulders. we know we are up to the challenge of our role and will not disappoint when it really matters. we are the backbone of a team and it makes us feel good to be able to be that rock that everyone can count on. we are the 1 position on the team who has the ability to help everyone and we aren t just playing for our own satisfaction. we may not get the spotlight but we are essential. everyone else can be replaced but not us. we are the anchor.
dudes dont make fun of healers. we fall in love with them.
I wish fury road  a movie supposedly about mad max....was actually about mad max.
hardy   your posh south african accent is no match for my soft yet firm and manly british accent.
so she felt threatened because tom hardy woke up late  roflmao
ok mel  second time you mentioned carbs being an issue. you are right  eating more carbs requires a higher level of activity. what you dont mention however is that not all carbs are the same. simple carbohydrates  breads  cakes  anything with flour for example are a lot of calories not easily processed by the body. I choose a whole foods diet  nuts  flak seeds  and other foods higher in fiber. there are a lot of benefits from fueling up with complex carbs.
tom hardy is the chillest dude irl. hes borderline effeminate. like james mcavoy. super chill.
I stopped taking her seriously when she said she doesnt date cause she s too hot for everyone lol
melonie mac comes out looking a bit more like lara croft. how was the first week of the carnivore diet  Im so glad quartering shouted you out its nice to see a Christian also covering these topics.
so much for  strong and independent
carbs still do more harm than good for most regardless of the source. they re an unessential macro and spike your insulin. eat whatever you want  but like I said  they re not actually helping you unless youre an athlete.
also recent studies show fiber is worse for your digestion. you dont need that either lol
@melonie mac go boom  I am no means a nutritionist but we will agree to disagree that carbs are harmful. complex carbohydrates provide not only needed fuel  but also essential nutrients the body needs to stay in balance. my motivation was high cholesterol  and fiber is absolutely needed to bring that in to check without medication. ultimately  everyone is different. you should find what works best for you.  peace
Ive been on the carnivore diet for over 2 years. the first month took adapting to tho for sure  but after that it got better rapidly and I feel my best yet now
love the Bible parts. very cool format .
I like playing healer or support roles in games. besides wow where dps was my main.
2 leading actors  one with a hangover  probably    arguing on set... whats the story  she intimidated him enough and he treated her as an equal!  he probably forgot anything about it in 5 mins. she will remember it word for word  for decades. anyway their chemistry worked in the film for sure.
trying to get you a point for my gfuel order I placed on sunday lol  of course I used your code mac.  ps.... I sooo want a meloniemac shaker cup haha.
love tom hardy
loving the scripture at the end. well done.note  women on a fat  energy  dependent diet  i.e. keto   carnivore  regulate hormones and tend to make women more fertile. as it can balance out her hormones  lesson her monthly cramps and give her a regular cycle. this in turn will lowering her stress hormones  improve her coping skills and lesson neurotic tendencies. just a warning to those not wanting the babies right away because this is a real thing.fats are precursors to hormones  carbs do nothing but throw hormones out of balance.this is coming from a nutritionist  melanie is correct on everything she said. women do tend to do far better on a low low carb  moderate protein  high fat diet. if you go with a glucose  carbs sugar  dependent diet then I will use the analogy of carb eating animals such as gazelles and cows  what do they do all day  they eat constantly and when not eating  they chew their cud. carbs burn in your system hot and quick  thus you ll be eating more often to maintain a healthy body composition  fat or skinny  carbs sugar can do both depending on your genetics . as melanie said   skinny fat.  the second part of the analogy  what do big game cats do  i.e. lions and tigers etc  they eat a small handful of times a day if at all  yet can maintain muscle and strength by eating what  fat s and protein.
back when I played wow religiously  very few healers Imet could out heal me. all the ones that could were female.
she started sh   she cant finish a badass victim
I wish I had the faith that melony has. the disdain I have come to feel after the passed five or so years has really pushed me away from my walk with God.
I would hope so  it is on the job description to fool others into thinking its real.
this is bs she wanted another woman to have an almost guarantee of her  own group preference  to take her side in all things. and how amazing she was talking about her own safety when she is the one that lost control. always the victim.
good stuff mac.
I hate waiting for people. imagine sitting in a hot truck for 3 hours.
your hair looks so cute today. killin it girl  go boom
how does charlize theron sleep at night
arg  a cat!  doesnt melonie know the internet hates cats !
even when I walk through the darkest valley  I will not be afraid  for you are close beside me. your rod and your staff protect and comfort me. psalm 23 4. I will admit im not a religious person  but this psalm always conforts me  it makes me feel less loneley  also  and this is very important  caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
hey mel I just want to say that hollywood celebs try to have a great comments but most of the time that they are wrong of saying something that they dont know what they are really really talking bout after they noticed that they are wrong bout the comment  ok mel. also charlize theron thought she was tough by chewing tom hardy out but tom was trying to help her out by having tom being on the film set on time  ok mel. anyway I just want to tell you that   I just want to comment on this topic  ok mel. anyway hope you have a great evening at home with your pets   have a good night too  ok mel.
welcome back coltrane good to see you and could you tell us what your views are on tomb raider have a good week p.s. when you tell us your views please do not get distracted by my canary frosty and certainly do not lick your chops..
the director and or producer of mad max were at fault they allowed tom hardy s behavior charlize theron should have yelled at them not tom hardy its not her job and lets face the real reason she felt unsafe the reason tom hardy was always late he was probably strung out on drugs normal hollywood behavior that production company enables one last thing you should get a post office box so we can send cole train kitty snacks
thank you so much!
please stay with God. the crap we re dealing with is because people are misusing their free will and not following God s commandments. this is part of his permissive will and not his perfect will. stick with God  and in the long run it will be so much more than worth it. good luck  and God bless you.
lesson from the story  if true  . do not approach a man in a male frame  even when angry.  a man instinctually responds to a male frame  with a male frame which will be confrontational.  do not compete this way ladies.  it is bad.  approach from a calm  feminine frame  and the guy  if not an azzhole  will be calm in his response.
I think the problem is tom hardy is a rare creature in hollywood   an alpha male. charlize is used to berating the gazelles  then ran into a lion.
if thats all it took  then danny g from smethwick birmingham would traumatize her.
it doesnt matter if youre a guy or woman  you never  never  run up at a dude and get into his face aggressively. most guys  red blooded guys  have an animal instinct that triggers a fighting response that few can control. thats why usually when you see a guy do that to another guy thats how shoving matches get started and usually ends in fist-to-cuffs. thatshit doesnt change  because  a woman does it. just like you never grab a woman  even in play  when she doesnt see you or know youre there ... you dont run up aggressively on a dude  its a good way to end up on your ass - man or woman.
7 38 it totally sounds like you are saying  she is inseminating herself . lmao!by the way you are looking especially beautiful today girl!  3
dk tank was so much fun back in the day
is g-fuel keto friendly  does it have sugar and carbs in it  or is there non-sugar version
they wanna get involve with something that isn t any of their damn business
dont know if I buy it. hardy apparently let shia labeouf get away with punching him during a movie. that doesnt sound like someone who gets aggressive with people. just sayin .
Ive been trying to gain weight my whole life 150-160 no matter what.
fury road does hold up with the other mad max movies. all of them are dated in their own way
also to gain weight avoid caffeine.  his sister could also have a high metabolism.  habits   make a conscious habit to not get excited   well  there goes gaming.
so that  actress  started the verbal violence and then feared it might turn to physical violence  well the point of verbal violence is to start the physical violence  is the prelude  the part before the fun part of punching begins.
Ive been enjoying carnvore crisps for four days now. fantastic! I like adding a bag or two to my breakfast!
that kitty is so cute.
if you scream and yell at a man  you have to be prepared for a reaction. doesnt matter if youre right or not.also  hardy should get his lazy ass out of bed.
if I was a guy in hollywood. I would be the one walking around with company.  or with a gopro in my chest.  expecting that at any time some crazy chick is gonna try to accuse me of something.  and also  I wouldn t want to ever work with anyone that have acted like charlize did.  she basically acted as if there was a predator on set.  if you think so lowly of me  then Im not working with you.
any moba I can play healer in  or support  I always liked support classes in games
my friend told me about this one a few days ago and I did a little digging she talked s    and tom hardy didn t take it lying down tom hardy did nothing wrong but Im just a human sandworm hybrid what do I know edit  sorry I respect the hustle and no offense but youre an internet person Im just talking for user engagement while pregaming for world war 3
it gets old because she s a woman who always wants to get media attention and years after the movie has come out and them she decides to throw that he said she said kinda thing out there its just dandy because like female actors those who just cant get enough of the exposure they have to drag someone else into the grind totally unprofessional on her part. rather than having a formal discussion she s about taking over the set and telling everyone thatshe is offended by everything.  just ought to be on the rust set with alec baldwin and see how that works out.  he might have another accident anything is possible right!
good times!
yes it is keto friendly. I drink the hydration formulas every day
woah I didn t hear about that one! haha sounds like it then. also given how she cussed him the heck out  a  what did you say to me !  is very tame
@melonie mac go boom  no doubt. plus   what did you say   sounds like it could be a bad read. it could be like she says and be a  what did you just say to me !  . or it could be a  pardon  I didn t catch that. . and Im not saying a hollywood actress would ever embellish something for victim points but... wait. yeah  they d totally do that. lol
if you want to gain fat then up your fat intake. if you want to gain muscle up your protein. eat 200g protein every day minimum and add in lots of fats like butter  cheese  and lift weights. you will gain. you could always drink some whey protein and add milk and peanut butter shakes to help too. you thousand percent would gain if you tracked your food.
metabolism isn t inhumanly drastic between people. if someone is skinny  fat  or anything in between it is almost entirely diet related unless there is some underlying health problem
oh heck yesss!
news flashwoman flies off the handle aggressively at man.. and is then surprised and shocked when he doesnt apologise but instead stands his ground.insanity.. the world has gone mad..btw.. I actually love both charlize theron and tom hardy as actors. so definitely not taking sides..I wouldn t dare.. heaven forbid someone sends the gender-neutral lara croft after me..
he was probably late to the shoot because his character  which is supposed to be the main character  is barely in it compared to ms. mary sue.
women are happy to run their mouth when they believe that men cant respond.  you create the monster that way.  when it comes to charlize and tom. the only reason she got away with saying that like that  is because tom has some measure of control. maybe less that day. but he could have crushed her easily.  and she would have been the victim despite being the instigator. men have moments of weakness too.  when a man has a problem  he s the problem.  when women have problems  they are victims.  im certainly not condoning violence on women. but I do think women forget what men are capable of.  and take mens inaction for granted.   just look at iraq  etc.  men there wouldn t allow it.
sounds like she s taking notes from amber heard
as messed up as itsounds for anyone wanting to get into the hobby  Im off the opinion that hobbies should be gatekept
I still dont understand how can people really love fury road
she blew things out of portions wtf. she has a massive ego. Im 5 11 Im not intimidated by taller women Im attracted to them really yeah Im weird  .
when I played overwatch  I wanted to be a mercy main. the problem was that other people kept wanting to play healer  lucio or mercy as well  so I had to be able to play other roles if I couldn t be mercy so I would do d.va  meI or tracer. haven t played in a while but my point stands
its miss croft.  hail.
the guys that look down on women for playing healers are the ones not doing the content thats actually challenging.  our wow raid has two female players  and one is a healer.  the other is an ex-healer thats tanking now.  its...  well I ll just say she was better at healing.  tanking requires more traditionally masculine traits  and healing requires more feminine ones.  honestly its a fine example of human sexual dichotomy in action.  find me a mmo where healers aren t the most underrepresented role and I ll show you one that women actually play.  we need more girls to game.  Im tired of sitting in queues.
9 49 to 9 56 - thats not quite true. soy protein is a complete protein and pea protein is near-complete  both of which are good for muscle growth given enough quantity and of course exercise. see also the science article   the effects of whey vs. pea protein on physical adaptations following 8-weeks of high-intensity functional training  which examines the effects of whey and pea protein supplementation when conjoined with exercise.
stronk independant womxn that needs no man scared of man what else is new.
I d agree if it weren t for the fact there are multiple accounts of hardy behaving in an extremely aggressive manner towards other cast members in various shoots  men and women alike . he has clear temper control issues and based on the numerous accounts  and self admission of his temper   I am giving theron the benefit of the doubt on this one.
cute cats are always popular. coltrane is very cute.
it was intentional to get better performances
Im carnivore too irony. at my age 176cm tall and 63kg they cant say a damn thing about this diet being bad for us. Im ripped on this diet.
great vid  melonie...
commenting to feed the algorithm and for the kitty
that tell him what your boundries are  it baffels me you talk about it later down the line instead of telling him itstraight off.stupidity never fails to amaze me.
women dont physically intimidate men.  there s zero fear of getting beat up.
its one of my faves lol! xd
soy is one of the worst things you can put in your body and pea protein isn t very beneficial either. while they are considered complete proteins  human bodies do not absorb them the same as animal proteins. we need animal based protein and animal based fats to optimally absorb said amino acids
@melonie mac go boom  human bodies do not absorb them the same as animal proteinsbut what about the study I referenced thatstudied the effects of pea protein on exercise thatseems to suggest otherwise  thatstudy concluded  that ingestion of whey and pea protein produce similar outcomes in measurements of body composition  muscle thickness  force production  wod performance and strength following 8-weeks of hift. soy is one of the worst things you can put in your bodyIm not convinced the scientific evidence supports this. a quick search turns up the scientific study  soy and health update  evaluation of the clinical and epidemiologic literature  which says   the presence of isoflavones has led to concerns thatsoy may exert untoward effects in some individuals. however  these concerns are based primarily on animal studies  whereas the human research supports the safety and benefits of soyfoods. which when you think about should hardly be surprising  soybeans and peas are vegetables  and vegetables are frequently good for you.
yeah just gonna stick with real meat protein
I would say the same but her reputation speaks for itself as well
Ive heard the total opposite.
great movie
ngl melonie looks like lara craft in this video
give  clap  the  clap  cat  clap  a  clap  microphone  clap
conspiracy theory vs charlize theron.. I bet on conspiracy theories
--- remembers the healer strike in guild wars 1.
nice cat you have.I also like cats. I have 8 cats and 1 little dog. they are family to me.greets from the netherlands.
shes so cute  why
I watched fury road once.
noticing the color of the tank top. looking very lara croft in this one. where s the guns
I kinda liked that last mad max movie.the game ....not so much
I be a old bricklayer and tommy threw her out with the bath water
rename to  melonie mac and the cat go boom
boooooom!!!!boomshaker!  pmarketing! almost burped... hahaha do a britany ventI and scare the shit out of me  where I even thought it was a dude burping.
any relation to the cole train off gears of war
nice information.
wait. wait..... I saw charlize kick the asses of numerous men bigger than tom. Imean  she s beaten ninjas. she has skilz.I dont believe any of this........................
cole  as in coletrain

yeah I dont believe her.....
you mean the person who transd her kid is afraid of tom hardy
yup  d
@melonie mac go boom  hahaha yass x
so she screams her fucking head off and makes disparaging remarks about him and when he responds she s the victim
often being 3 hour late to work and let whole crew waiting in desert   still have crap attitude while being scolded - mr hardy is a horrible person.
your rumble channel still does not come up in a rumble search
boom!!!
she s one who brings the abuse to the set ..to tom   . if the shoe was on the other foot. . woke .  bullshit.  love from london.
I see your lara tank top girl
kitty!!!!!!!!
how would yall rate g-fuel vs redbull  I dont like addiction  and redbull is.
thats because charlize theron is a wameeeeeen.
I liked tom hardy in inception. haven t seen any of theron s films  her work hasn t been of interest. she is also a woke fool who is abusing her adopted child. I hate it when folks are late  for sure. Im a 15 mintues early is five minutes late kind of guy. that being said  if she called hardy out for being late and then got skeered when he reacted  thats on her. eff her.
sounds like she got super aggressive like a man  got an equal response and now playing victim and wants her  metoo moment to sell her book.
hImelonie you are my favorite youtube next to razorfist the rageaholic have you heard of him
kitty cat
I dont like how some say im a dem  cuz I support the ukraine as a catholic I always choose people over politics and never want death idk
ding bat ladies. you get in my face. I as a man will inflict damage. do not get in my face. do not raise your voice at me.
the conflict started with her unless of course she was the one signing his paycheck.kinda looks like a hit piece on toxic masculinity  true or false.  even if true  this information did not need to be released or even in this manner.  twas pinned with purpose.  but what purpose
my opinion of charlize theron wasn t good to begin with but it just got lower. Ive seen interviews with her and she comes across as angry  highly narcissistic and self righteous. basically your typical hollywood celebrity. most of them in real life are completely useless.
if video games going mainstream has killed it as an industry its really killed the comic book one with all the sjw bs. the way marvel dc dark horse image are going they ll be gone in a couple years. in five years the industry will be unrecognizable. smh
glory to ukraine
I dont get people s love of fury road  it was an ok chase movie. I dont find her intimidating at all.
itshows up for me when I search it. just type in  melonie  in the search bar under channels
wamen who got caught maskless at the super bowl after her endless woke social media grandstanding.
sorry  just finished the rest of the video...yeah my bad.dont rely on psychology to figure people out.  you can be misled.  sometimes by that person who views your feeble attempts to understand them and purposely gives you false signals....people are complex.  give everyone praise  even the big heads  because not all are narcissistic and not all actually have big heads.  pride is a hard thing to root out sometimes.  for both people in the exchange.  you ll find yourself struggling in the strangest of areas and situations depending on how closely you monitor your emotions.  youre choosing to withhold praise to another...if they are Christian  they should be dealing with that pride issue later at home.  if not  be nice.  hell is gonna be hot  maybe tell them about Jesus so they can work on that pride.

boooooooom
maybe he showed up late  because she is maybe a horrible sjw type and he got tired of being around her so much.
the feminist cries out in victimhood as she strikes you.
well  he was rude for being 3 hours late...
sorry to say ....but I have tasted a few different g fuell......dont like any off them.
be on time  ffs. unprofessional.
looking like a super misogynistic laura croft today
one of the early ones!
Ive never cared for this charlize person. haven t seen any of her movies  but dont care for what she  stands  for  Im not about wokeness. also  on a trivial level  she is super overrated as a  looker . Im not impressed with her on that front at all either. in this particular instance  sounds like she wrote a check thatshe couldn t cash and is now crying about it. to afghanistan with her.
hey melonie...im not trying to be rude.....but whats up with your hair
sorry but as a gym instructor the way we learned it  any exes protein will be stored as fat and just really unhealthy.
em  let s wait 7 years to bring this nonsense up. waste of valuable time
great video  but like... g fuel is complete garbage though  underdosed  over priced  and uses a proprietary blend for its antioxidants so you cant see how much of any of that youre even getting beyond just  everything in it adds up to 26mg  . why do so many youtubers push this swill unsolicited advice from a random dude   get a sponsor that doesnt rip off their customers   your soul will thank you.ok  rant over  keep up the good work  God bless!
lol basic
gfuel is garbage.  drop it as a sponser and find something legit.
dang... I just used your code for gfuel two days ago.  hope itstill counts for ya!
if you like fury road go to a channel on yt called e r  e semicolon r  and watch mad maxine. it is pretty funny and I think you will like it.
youre just plain wrong. protein poisoning  rabbitstarvation exists. you can starve to death with a belly full of protein. protein does not store as fat  point blank lol
@melonie mac go boom  double check it  I did.
whether excess protein gets stored as fat depends on whether youre consuming enough calories. generally  excess calories get stored as fat regardless of whether its protein or carbohydrates. if youre burning enough calories  protein wont get stored as fat.
@melonie mac go boom  protein does not store as fat  point blankit can in some circumstances  but dont take my word for it  see the mayo clinic web article   are you getting too much protein   which says   the body cant store protein  so once needs are met  any extra is used for energy or stored as fat. excess calories from any source will be stored as fat in the body.
@maverick Christian  thats my understanding of it too.
its all good  thank you so much it helps!
