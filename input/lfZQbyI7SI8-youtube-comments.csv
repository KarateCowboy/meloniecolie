for all their other writing flaws  they are doing a great job of showing us why jen is still single in her 30s.
Im a female in her 30s who grew up watching she-hulk from the animated 90s incredible hulk show  so to them I am the target demographic for their show lol. this show is the opposite of what she-hulk is supposed to be. I loved her growing up  she embraces her title and thanks bruce for her new superpowers. she is confident without the narcissism  feminine and sensual while being strong  brave and bold  always proud to be who she is. I dont get any of that in this new show  just toxic feminist rage. she hates her title  mocks the avengers  and puts down bruce for not knowing what real anger is  what  getting catcalled on the street is worse than watching your parents die in front of you  pleeease!!!   disney completely and utterly destroyed she-hulk. and no  they dont get to blame men.
the entire show has made the effort to make men look bad in every episode  yet in this episode it was men that made her realise she needs to love herself before another party can love her
for me its such a cop-out when  female empowerment  shows and or movies have to dumb men down and make look like idiots in order to build the female s  characters up. its lazy writing at its finest.
funny thing is  they basically show you that jen s mindset and way of life will lead you into being miserable  getting meaningless one night stands and then getting dumped  drinking at every opportunity  and pretty much end up alone with maybe a shallow friend or two. and they dont seem to realize what they re doing  because they re dead set on making us believe she s doing great.
tony stark has one night stands to show he is a jerk. jen does it to show she is empowered lol
the director mentioned that the show is sex-positive  but this lifestyle seems to be leaving her empty and unfulfilled lol
jen is the one who is in control. jen is the one making all the decisions. jen is the one putting herself out there in the way she is. every problem jen has  she is the one causing. even the car crash  she was the one driving.this entire show is not about what the writers think its about. its not about this woman fighting against sexist or gender roles. its about this woman who has power  has control  and how women cant be trusted with that kind of power because they ll hurt themselves endlessly with it. this show is about how women can not be trusted to act responsibly. and fuck this show for that.
the show advocates for independence  but the entire series she needs a man to make her feel complete
jen s problems with people liking her she-hulk form more just comes off as weak when her version of the powers doesnt make the form some sort of alternate persona. she-hulk isn t a different  person  that people like more  she s not jen s  cooler friend   she s jen with green muscles that jen can switch between for no price and has thee xact same personality. its the equivilent of making a big deal of people being more attracted to you with make-up on. especially when its not like jen really seems to put much effort into being appealing on her own.she s the female version of thatstereotype of a slob who s pissed that girls are so shallow and only like the hot guys  but only wants tens.
everyone loves when someone hates on she hulk  it brings us together and spreads happiness.
when she was nominated for lawyer of the year and has done about 2 cases
real men in no way act like anyone of the guys at blondskI s retreat. maybe those guys are the feminists   the show writers   ideal version of a man but they certainly are not representative of how straight normal men are. they were more like a group of a woman s gay male friends.
Im so glad neither my wife or I got into the hookup culture. not a whole lot can out annoy disappoint more than hearing people attempting to brag about their hookups
youre 10000  right. I had someone that I was interested in but once she told me they dont want kids  I broke the relationship. she was so mad and told me we re just having fun. so I guess I killed the fun  because I have wants and things Im looking forward to.
she hulk character they created is a truly awful person  not like the original character at all. she is a self insert for the emotionally messed up director lady.
I want people to like me as just jen and not she hulk.   except when you wanna make old high school acquaintances jealous at one of their weddings.
I didn t believe in the claim that women aren t funny until Ive watched the latest marvel cinematic universe project  she-hulk.  -martin scorsese
modern dating practices has completely warped relationships.  her points about hookup culture causing emotional damage is very spot on.  physical intimacy is considered the apex of a relationship with someone  and people engage in it the first time they meet each other.  its treated in such a throwaway manner and people get confused. we used to value people and use things.  we now value things and use people.
I cannot thank you enough for suffering through this crap  so I dont have to waste any of my life money on it. stay strong  this content is one of the biggest highlights of my day!

wait are you implying men dont want to date a nagging narcissist
its a metaphor for how the writers are single too.
she needs more cats and boxed wine.
thats exactly what I thought.  its an incredibly realistic depiction of a woman that you would want to avoid like the blackest plague.  the kind of woman who would haunt your ass for months if you made the mistake of going home with her after a night at the bar  and then made the mistake of giving her your actual phone number.
lol  they also showed why  nobody catcalls her .
@unknown God  this is what I was thinking.

good point  guy.  imagine if a man wrote jen to be this pathetic  it wouldn t happen!  jen would be written as strong and interesting. even if she was written as lacking in confidence at first  it wouldn t be as pathetic and they d have her get past it by episode 2 or 3.
@frank belmont  is she that bad of person I dont know
hopefully  if anything  this garbage show could lend some appreciation for the original comics and cartoon show. and I totally agree with you. I love strong female characters like she-hulk and many others for the same values you mentioned  and its so sad to see modern shows and movies get rid of all that for complete toxicity.
animated comic she-hulk   live action she-hulk
Im a twenty-something year old man who likes she-hulk for basically the same reasons as you. I was introduced to the character from the incredible hulk cartoon from the 90s and just loved her attitude and looks  and the relationship she had with bruce hulk.
its possible thatshe-hulk  initially  wants nothing to do with the avengers  the same way she  initially  didn t like being called she-hulk. in my college writing classes  I learned that the main character of any great story must  transform  in some meaningful way. they begin the story one way  then things happen to them that cause them to change  grow  and transform into something new. the fact that jennifer  resists  the things that the audience expects her to embrace  makes the series interesting. jennifer isn t just another super-powered being  who immediately  falls into line  with the expectations that the audience has for her. she initially resists becoming a superhero  and then a series of calamities will compel her to embrace her moral duty to keep the peace  as only she can  in a world full of super-powered villains.
@lunaderacine do you like the actress playing she hulk
wrong!
she hulk episodes in the 90 s cartoon were the best episodes of thatseries... smart  sexy  sarcastic and sensual  and of course hulk strong... why couldn t they just lean in to that
@scorch1028  I d be down for that explanation if we were on episode 2... the problem is you cant  arc  the last few episodes of the show  this would be like finding the entire fellowship unlikable until the point sam takes the lead in mordor in return of the king with about the development the hobbits had when they first reached the barrows as they left tom bombadil.
well to be fair  the people behind the mcu  producers  writers and directors  have never touched a marvel comic book  so that explains a lot.
@michael lane  I think that what disney is doing is making the she-hulk character as  unique  as they possibly can  so that the viewers dont see the show as  old wine in new bottles . its too predictable for she-hulk to follow the same path as every other superhero the minute that her powers   abilities manifested. there has to be  conflict  with she-hulk s story  to give the audience a sense that her journey of becoming a superhero didn t happen on day 1 or even day 100.
jennifer walters has a lot of law school debt. that can hamper a person s ability to settle down. I really dont mind thatshe has high standards for men. thats typical for women her age.
@frank belmont  I find she-hulk to be 10 times more attractive than jennifer walters.
true
Ive been thinking the same thing. the sad fact is she is written pretty realistically  which is sad for real life people.
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
bro I see you everywhere
@scorch1028  still shouldn t cat fish people by acting like she hulk is your only persona
yeah  great. that is what I watch marvel shows for. I hope the next episode will just show her for another 45 minutes checking her phone  that would be so great!!
she s a fanfic self-insert.
@bazooka ike  yeah. no doubt men will create great development for her
@the marsman   jennifer walters in both forms  is having difficulty finding a man thatshe finds acceptable. her  standards  are keeping her single. so  she s actually  worse off  than the guys thatshe s rejecting. now  she s in even bigger trouble  because the so-called  right guy  josh  is part of the intelligensia group that is working to bring her down. they plan to create  new hulks  with her dna.
@frank belmont
something there trying to make woman feel ashamed of which is sexist in itself
@unknown God  yeah these must be very bitter woman
@hatuletoh  she is a woman that would make a straight guy go gay if he isnt already
30s   she looks like 40s
@scorch1028  Im honestly not even sure why they want to bring she-hulk down. they seem like dumb antagonists. jen is a horrible person  dont get me wrong  but she hasn t done anything worthy of having an entire organization out to get her.
@scorch1028  seems like they really went to lengths to make her drab
for all their other writing flaws  they are doing a great job of showing us why the writers are still single in their 30s.fixed it.
cringey.
outstanding
@gabeseditz    she has something they want.
ong
@shaun lasich  for what  though  we haven t learned shit lmao. guess its another example of the show being lazy.
@scorch1028  low iq
@scorch1028  nvm you valid
@the l delivery man  yeah  nvm is right because youre not in the target audience for she-hulk.
@the l delivery man  you are  for sure.
@gabeseditz  it makes sense for the intelligensia to bring her down  because they plan to create other hulks. sooner or later  she s going to come face-to-face with these new hulks.
@scorch1028  lol I said low iq cause you said you dont mind her high standards that drives me crazy I been mentally checked out since episode 4 when we saw the daredevil tease I had hope then she checked her phone for 30 minutes last week and I was pissed
@scorch1028  are women her age who are looking for men  single mothers
what s worse is that they re trying to push this idea that this is normal and we should accept that this represents all women.
@unknown God  lol!
@samwb  lol!
gold. simply golden. glad to see this already has a thousand likes.
ha
truthtold
I was going to say   its not a far cry from how women act in real life.  attacking men  then wondering   why dont men approach is anymore   what she did is basically the sexual equivalent of  if I dont like him  its harassment  otherwise its flirting.
@unknown God  exactly
@scorch1028  unfortunately the character is developing so slowly the plot of each episode seems to happen in spite of her development rather than causing or being caused by her development as itshould be.Im far from hating this show but that feels more like an innate personal bias rather than stemming from any redeeming value the show has... I cant say that I like or dislike the main character as much as she seems like the reason the plot can barely move  there really hasn t been much if any conflict she actually solved and she hasn t really driven any of the conflict outside her friends getting her a suitshe didn t seem to want.
yep you said it perfectly. Im a 32 year old guy  and I really was excited for the show at first  I loved she hulk in the 90s cartoon and comics as a kid. hulk and she hulk were always my favorite. just a shame the way they ve handled things in the show  cuz I liked the actress they chose for she hulk initially!
you beat me to it!
@scorch1028  I wanted to be charitable and was hoping this would be the case... but such a transformation has to occur over time for it to feel earned... they have not done the work.  how many episodes are left  one  I am guessing they will try to force a moment of transformation at the last minute... but  will that be enough to balance the majority of the story which shows her to be motivated by self interest  I dont think it will.  10  heroism does not make up for 90  narcissism
I am sorry but youre the opposite of their target audience. they haven t read the comics before this project and hence wouldn t want those who have read it to fault their work. the writers just wanna portray their agenda  not the source material.
best way to get banned on tv tropes  list her rant at bruce as  wangst .
@paul enger  she-hulk s transformation into a person who accepts her duty to protect ordinary people from supervillains might not happen this season. I am patient.
@scorch1028  this has been a pet peeve of mine for adaptations lately. take beloved characters  have them start out as the opposite of what we know them to be  and then say the show will get better as they slowly become the characters we know. thats just a lazy way to make an arc.its why it was so hard for me to get into rise of the tmnt and why ultimate spider-man kept pushing my patience. if you want an example of this kind of development done right  check out transformers animated in regards to optimus prime. he starts out in a not so great position and he s inexperienced  but itstill feels like the same character. same for the 2012 tmnt series with leonardo. he starts out his leadership by trying to imitate the heroes he saw on tv  but itstill felt like an accurate portrayal of my favorite turtle.
1. we dont know if thatstory about bruce s parents is canon to the mcu.2. she didn t say she had it harder.3. she hulk is the most comic accurate mcu character  by far.
@dragonage2ftw  yeah  I read the she-hulk comics from the 1980s and 1990s  and this current she-hulk in the mcu has the same  beliefs and attitudes   as her comic book counterpart does. in the comic books  she-hulk did not like being defined by her cousin bruce  and she often criticized what she  perceived  to be sexism. the current version of she-hulk isn t some new  woke  creation. its very faithful to the original character.
@dragonage2ftw  in the context of the conversation being about how anger is dangerous to them as hulks  things that provoke anger are stumbling blocks which they must constantly overcome.  so  when she says thatshe controls her anger  infinitely more  than him... yes... she is saying thatshe had it harder.  sure  the death of banner s parents might not be canon in the mcu  but there are enough examples of banner having had a difficult go at life  that can be substituted to make a point of the ridiculousness of the comparison between the two  especially as it is presented in this show.
@dragonage2ftw  lmao no she isnt accurate to the comics at all as the comics version actually has a character
@scorch1028  how is having the same beliefs and attitudes have anything to do with how crap the quality is  they could ve did the show a lot better thats the point but gave it to hack writers please dont even try to defend the way they wrote the court system in this show it literally makes no sense. sucking up to disney at this point is moot. the show isn t going to get better that way but at least theyll learn when something flops
@fatty1040  Im not sucking up to disney. Ive read the original she-hulk comic books from marvel earth-616  and this mcu she-hulk has a personality that is consistent with the original character. I dont have a problem with the court room scene because its all fiction.
@scorch1028  Im pretty sure the show is called she hulk attorney at law. literally half the title and you think not having anything to do with a courtroom isnt a bad thing smh. thats the whole point of she hulks character is she is an attorney. being a lawyer or even attempting to become one is a whole damn character arc on its own and we re supposed to believe this jen can actually do these things with her  attitude  and  character . sorry but someone who can do these things wouldn t be so narcissistic  lonely  or even entitled. in fact the whole lawyer thing  if the writers took a second to think  should ve made her look at her own life to see how privileged she actually is.
@fatty1040  youre taking a show based on a  comic book character  way too seriously. like other female attorneys  jennifer walters wants to date a man who is  at her level  or greater. thats a societal phenomenon that exists in  our universe   not just the mcu.  thats just how things are.
@scorch1028  lmao expecting the law to at least be taken seriously is the bare minimum of expectations for a show called  attorney at law  im not expecting them to be ultra realistic mind you im expecting them to actually know what they are talking about or referencing which isnt a lot to ask  itshould be if youre going to make a show involving a lawyer character but I digress  which is why this show is disappointing. they couldve put any other female superhero up there to say all this  relatable social commentary  but they wasted she hulks character who is a lawyer first! its quite literally false advertising. no that isnt how things are at all  thats how things are for privelleged people or especially narcissistic groups. at least they caught that as her reason to be alone in this show. its actually the only thing that makes sense here. also if you actually knew she hulks character in comics im pretty sure she wasnt this hung up on dating and wasnt a big issue that needed 5 or 6 episodes to be about.
@fatty1040  I dont get the  narcissism  that youre referring to. itsounds to me like youreally dont enjoy watching the show. you should probably watch something else instead.
@scorch1028  narcissism is an attitude and a lifestyle which she hulk in the show displays.  the fact you said shes waiting for a man to be equal level and cant even aknowledge thatstatement really is curious . which sucks overall because she hulk in the comics wasnt this insufferable nor this badly written. its kind of funny you want to accept the crap because its mcu instead of vying for them to change their aptitude with the show. so much for knowing the comics if this is acceptable for you. like me most people were expecting at least a competent show not social commentary  its not even  talking about the right things or rather real problem just first world ones
@fatty1040  again  you have a problem with the way thatshe-hulk is written. I dont. there are  way more woke shows  than she-hulk  like  y  the last man . if you dont like she-hulk  then youre free to watch other programs. Im going to keep watching it.
@scorch1028  funny I never mentioned it being woke at all. I like the originalshe hulk and its such a shame to see her character reduced to a mouth piece for the prievlaged when in the comics her problems were actually real ones not superficial pompous ones. its like seeing sarah conner go back to waiting tables. trust me youre free to like this but do not pretend it couldnt have been better and isnt a waste of a good character. if you can give me one good reason why this show needed the character  she hulk  ill take back everything ive said because its clear to me and many others this show wasnt made for  she hulk  the character. it was made to he the writers personalized social commentary with she hulk as the puppet
@fatty1040  agree to disagree.
thank!!!!! I agree 100 !!! I stop watching this show after the first episode. that with bruce really upset me.
I was wondering where this insanity was coming from.
I was going to say  getting catcalled is worse than being a fugitive    but that works too.
I was with you until you confused the hulk with batman
I feel like she-hulk series is just implying the writer s own personal feelings into it and also into marvel without having any knowledge about the character or its history. she even admitted thatshe wasn t interested in the comic whatsoever and brought upon almost entirely her own story. Imean from the show alone you cantell  the team havent done any sort of homework in terms of the marvel universe history.I really wish someone who has more passion like you towards the character is the one who s writing the show.  currently its like someone who hates superhero genre is put into the role of writing one....
thank you! well said  and spot on. thats the she-hulk I remember well  on this end. I could tell from the beginning that this was not the she-hulk we knew and loved  and its just atrocious. this is toxic  not us men  or any of us fans who call this out as the hot garbage it is.
she straight up makes sexual remarks towards the thing from the fantastic 4 in that cartoon  I dont think youremember it as well as you think.
I dont mind the idea of her not wanting to be a superhero when she first gets her powers and then gradually over time she realizes she can do so much more. but I dont like her for putting down heros and say  being a hero is for orphans or rich guys looking for attention  something like that I cant remember the entire quote to that  that is just wrong especially the orphan part like jeeze ok idk who greenlighted that dialogue.
