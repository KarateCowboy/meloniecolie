I recommend your channel to my 16 year old daughter jordan she loves all your comic and anime content not to mention your positivity. also she loves how you are not afraid to declare your faith. whether yourealize it or not you are a bit of a role model!
king is the title given to a male monarch in a variety of contexts. the female equivalent is queen  1  which title is also given to the consort of a king.in norse mythology  a valkyrie   chooser of the slain   is one of a host of female figures who guide the souls of deceased soldiers in one of two paths.if disney cant even follow basic english rules  maybe it too complicated for them
to sum the situation upking emperor   male rulerqueen empress   female rulermarvel   a bunch of idiots who dont know how language worksthe mcu has no future  not even dr.strange can save this utter woke mess from imploding and falling apart.
I think youre right on point calling it what it is  evil.  itseems harsh but its true. it just baffles me how much support these evil agendas appears to get. thank you for being a strong  unapologetic and feminine voice of the light. God knows we could sure use more of those. enjoy your day everyone.
as a norse pagan....ffs I never thought I d have to type that or say that. Ive always refrained from being petty about my culture and spirituality. especially w  marvel. obviously  mythology  holds a comic attraction. this shit is treading the line. freya is the queen of the valkyrie according to the old skalds and eddas. the valkyrie serve odin. you gonna tell me freya is going to be the love interest of  king valkyrie  next  and they re invovled in a lgbtq love triangle  its an insult. because its intentional.are they gonna make thor the Goddess of butterflies and baby farts next its cool. next time Imake an offering to the Gods I ll be sure to include buddha just to be inclusive.
you know  valkyrie was one of my favorite marvel lady crushes  along with she-hulk  scarlet witch  black widow  and black cat. now seeing what they ve done to them  makes me more depressed. where did femininity go    3 seriously  it looks like 40 year old women  pretending to be 14 year old boys ! you do not empower women by making them more masculine  you give them character traits  complex backstories  and obstacles for them to overcome. also  I got to comment on that mix-race remark  I feel ya on that. my lineage comes from norse  norway during viking age  on my mother s side and on my father side  I have persian  and either of them are beloved by this supposed inclusive group  because I chose to honor and respect both lines of my family  especially the more norse side  because dammit I have the height and appetite for it. pretty much  yeah  fuck these racist bastards. these elite assholes just want the lower class to kill each other  over petty shit that doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things.
excellent vod  mel! I am getting super sick of femininity being erased constantly. I refuse to buy marvel   dc comics because they are woke as hell  and I refuse to follow woke people  watch woke shows  youtubers   streamers and buy woke movies  video games   board games. I have absolutely no interest in woke shit and woke people.
they live in a world of extreme stereotypes  but then are also scared of what makes men men and women women.
kinda startling to hear someone speak about their religion so openly. something I grew up hearing in the media quite often is now practically condemned. I was raised Christian  dont neccesarily believe or disbelieve but I do enjoy people not feeling ashamed to speak about what they believe.
just discovered your channel today and Ive never heard before the erasure of femininity put like that. it means a lot coming from a female.
your closing statement thrilled me to the core.  thanks for that.  I really cant see this any other way.  this no longer about costumes and make-up.  this is no longer about about skin.  the words and the definition of them are so covered in mud and blood  that they hold no power but to blind the conversation.a blessing upon you and your clear voice.  may a flock of innocents and protection gather around you in millions of layers.God bless the mac.
king   the male ruler of an independent state  especially one who inherits the position by right of birth .I love how marvel wants ignorantly force female empowerment but then contradict themselves without even realizing it  by giving women titles based on men.
for the record  that art of comics valkyrie @7 00 is from marvel. Im 100  sure itshowed up on trading cards and promotional material 10-15 years ago  but obviously with the m-she-u version  its been swept under the carpet
your final comments reminded me of ephesians 6 12  for we wrestle not against flesh and blood  but against principalities  against powers  against the rulers of the darkness of this world  against spiritual wickedness in high places.  love your show  keep it booming.
I love the idea thatshe has to be a  king  to lead asgard. as if there s never been a strong  powerful queen in any part of humanity s history. smh.
Im so glad mr jeremy pointed some of us to you and Im really glad you ve got great content so we have another creator in the breach! your pop culture content got me interested but when you started dropping the word in your videos  I keep watching. youre the real deal and I appreciate that. one of my daughters now watches your videos and  Im glad there s another feminine woman for her to look up to.I agree with a lot of what you have to say but I think things are maybe a little worse than we re all led to believe. aside from divine intervention  I think we are stuck on a path we cant turn away from and as the culture war rages  I hope that everyone is prepared. not necessarily in a crazy prepper kind of way but please make sure you ve got enough food and water set aside to get through a few days if its required. have batteries and a plan with your family. have a means to defend yourself.I dont mean to fear monger. fear has nothing to do with it. knowledge of what s taken place the last two years should be enough for everyone to be warned. thank you for your great content and commentary ms. lion. take care and God bless you and the work youre doing.
being 50  cherokee myself  Ive had a number of people try telling me that Im not  native .I dont let them get in my way  or my head.being a documented direct descendant of double head  Im proud of my heritage.
itseems like this day in age  you cant be both feminine and a badass
the really nice valkyrie drawing was done by an artist named andrea divito. he did one of the best thor stories of the last twenty years with writer michael avon oeming. so  yeah  probably official.
wasn t the job of the valkyries to collect and escort the battlefield dead in norse mythology  hmmm.oh  and  king valkyrie   elizabeth  mary queen of scots  and hatshepsut would like a word.wait! pork-rind breading      zomg!!!!  wipes his chin
lol she s too healthy to be a  roll  model. I think you mean role model. but that is awesome your daughter has someone to look up to like melonie because she will see its ok to be strong in your beliefs and values.
Im a professional bad speller
@el guapo  only an amateur  you spelled professional correctly
omg thank you so much  this means a lot
her reading the scripture quote of the day was is such a breath of fresh air I instantly subbed
what faith
@spartan300  have you not watched her videos or do you have a hard time with english
amen and awesome.
they dont even follow their own rules - if they did  they would have the characters speak old norse scandinavian once in a while  in the same way they had different language in black panther   and bring in a european actor for new roles  but nope  we have this valkyrie and heimdall. marvel doesn  have standards  and they re beginning to betray even their double standards.
there is one woman ever in history which I can recall who held the title of king. in that case  it was specifically because the position was an elected position. yeah this is weird.
its not about maintaining proper definitions  its about obscuring lines and confusing people. its about  the message .
@dethtones  the message...you a critical drinker fan
@mark ziff  of course!
they dont care.
speaking as somebody who is english  have given up an americans with their highly inadequate historical knowledge of anything  british or european lol. look if youre not brought up in a culture where from childhood you studied the history of the country  went in school trips to castles  cathedrals  churches etc etc and studied the history youre not going to understand it properly .
the only thing I will say in disney s defense. the song from my fair lady is true.the english cant speak english and america hasn t used it in years. at least 60
exactly thank you  finally someone who has a brain
both marvel   dc movies are screwed.
@spartan300  so you need to live in the area a religion or belief originated from to practice said religion or belief  thats fascinating.edit  not to mention that america was largely founded by people fleeing religious persecution in europe  therefore most have european heritage.
@delvien vol  and who cares st the end of the day its extremely rich corporations in america buying the rights for these movies or tv series. its clear european companies are selling the rights for american money which is fine but dont get annoyed when they do what they went  with the material they purchased . american actors playing vikings are not swedish  norwegian or danish . period !! why not make a tv series with actual scandinavian actors playing the roles that would be more authentic
@spartan300  selling rights to the Gods  what company owns the Bible  how about the greek pantheon japan makes a huge number of intellectual property s based on american history and culture  most members that they cast for the roles are japanese. does anyone care  no because its japanese media. you want an authentic swedish movie then watch a movie from sweden. its not the united states job to satisfy the desires of the rest of the world.
@delvien vol  the Bible and the greek pantheon are historical facts so a ridiculous comparison   and also its at the end of marvels avengers endgame thor makes a decision to make the valkyrie woman the next king of asgard   she was reluctant as she believed thor should become the king but thor made his decision clearly as a result from his emotional ride guilt from not defeating thanos in infinity war     have you even seen avengers endgame this scene between valkyrie and thor occurs right at the end of endgame . this is s decision made two years ago by the marvel team . and you also see at the end of the movie captain america retiring his role when sent to return the soul stones   deciding to settle with his girlfriend . and hands over the shield   pretty damn good scenes in my opinion
this guy is a crazy dude   there is no such thing as horse pagans anymore   challenge this fool to go to norway sweden or denmark and say this to anyone there and apart from some crazies they will laugh in his face
@delvien vol  I challenge you to tell me about western culture because most things bring referred to here are historical so unless you have been to many museums and studied western culture you have no idea what it is.
@delvien vol  first of all america was not founded by europeans there were already people living there they were called native indian tribes .when Christopher columbus arrived he found there was an  already occupied and  discovered land . the europeans were invaders and occupiers in a land already lived in for at least one thousand years -  with their own social society and culture . and as myself actually from europe   the majority of people were poor people looking for a better life   itstarted out as religiously persecuted people
sir you are not been petty  in the slightest.
@spartan300  my brother in Christ  we bought manhatten from them.
@spartan300  this is old  but here s a tip  in one comment you say an america will never understand european culture or history because he hasn t lived it. you then give a very inaccurate lecture to americans about their own history and culture. if you dont see the problem here  you must be very dense. hopefully you ve grown up a bitsince you made these absurdly un-self-aware comments.
@grotesque head  you are trolling the wrong person
how is the character any different than they were back in thor ragnarok
@jose denis  to clarify  I was talking about the comic book version of valkyrie. also  the mcu valkyrie disgusts me  very unappealing to listen to and see her trying to be a valkyrie and failing. so  not different at all. if anything  my complaint is  the actress fails to portray valkyrie or even win my approval.
@bijan hakimian  why does she  digust  you  thats just a very odd choice of words. also their  femininity  didn t really go anywhere. the character is still female  with female characteristics. all they really did was just tone down the scantily clad armor she wore in the comics to make her less sexually appealing. that is not the same as  de-feminizing. if you dont like the way she is portrayed  then thats one thing. thats your opinion and youre entitled to it. but to say thatshe  looks like a 14-year old boy  is strange to me.
@jose denis  if you go back to the traditional norse depictions  valkyrior wore a whole lot less. the m-she-u version is incredibly toned down  and the funniest bit is that her toys and action figures really do not sell. besides  if thor is put through a topless scene for a  target audience    why isn t valkyrie as an aside  in thor ragnarok  they offed one of the valkyr that looked a whole lot like og brunhilde. then again  marvel is part of a media chain that likes to kill the past.as for the 14 year old boy part  I think its mostly that tessa thompson doesnt have the stature or facial structure to convincingly typecast as an ancient warrior badass. I suppose its an unfair standard to live up to  but innate stage presence matters in a visual medium
@gladerunner2113  exactly. rather than for the affirmative action blackwash  its because she was wrongly cast. I would cast katheryn winnick  even though she starred as a shieldmaiden in vikings. she has a sex appeal and charisma thatsurpasses tessa. she can easily play brunhilde. the philosophy I follow remains   hire based on pure talent  not on who they know  who they slept with  or who ticks the right boxes.  also  honor the best  by depicting them the way their authors had done  like Lord of the rings with peter jackson s logic.@jose denis dont do that. try to shift reasonable criticism into a racism dismissal  if that is what you were thinking  if not  I apologize for being harsh . a performer s ethnicity has nothing to do with their talent  it has to do with their character and demeanor. I am  disgusted  with thor ragnarok and tessa thompson  who was cast purely on the basis of her skin color. I admit  I could have used the word repulsed to describe her performance. oh and her action figure doesnt sell because m-she-u is erasing femininity from these well-established characters. they dont appeal to anyone.  the reason Imention the 14 years old boy thing is because that was my look when I was 14  the short hair with hair bangs  before I chose to go with the gandalf look  which is just long hair and a brushed beard  a manly-man look. further  I respect your opinion  and Im glad you admit I have a right to voice mine  since it remains merely that  an opinion...that millions of other people seem to share. a valid opinion nonetheless.
@bijan hakimian  katheryn winnick is a pretty good choice  yeah. I just found it telling that they hired an extra who looked the part better than the actual choice  because of the diversity checklist
marvel lady crushes  comic book characters  youre just as weird as woke marvel
it threw me off aswell but I welcome it.
@view bot  yep  now we have to reverse the roles lol. what a joke....
theyll change the definition. dont worry.
@jaer nihiltheus  thats even worse.  they always say masculinity is bad but then proceed to do masculine things.
@meticulousalpha  they consider masculinity is toxic  except when they use it.  very lacking in self-awareness   so uttery full of themselves.
@p. whitestrake  unfortunate truth
who ever said that the ruler of anything had to be a king  sounds you ve been reading too much feminist victim literature.
@devon henry  reading comprehension is clearly not your strong point.
thanks for talking about this ..... inspiring me to start speaking up more publicly.  I got 15 years of watching the wokism happening to entertainment I gotta unload lol
so when valkyrie does anything on screen  at the very least  we wont hear any  slay queen  yass!
not surprised  since those leaked photos from 3 years ago showed that tessa got her mcu role through a casting coach.
if she cant claim partial native american in her lineage  why can a person who is 10  black be called black   so tired of the hipocracy of the left and how it has taken over everything.  I gave up on cable t.v. back in the mid 90s  so glad I did as time progressed.  never liked social media  glad for that too.  my favorite shirt has the american flag and the words  my rights dont end where your feelings begin.   thanks for the video.  keep up the message.
youre over 20k! this is so cool to see in real time. your channel has more than doubled since I have joined. keep up the good work!
melonie  I know you literally just made this channel  but if you made a keto carnivore food dieting channel it would be a huge hit. my wife and I have been doing keto  not carnivore but very high   of meat  ribeyes  pork steaks etc . we do really spicy keto because we grow super hot chilis  we re a little crazy . more promotion of low carb diets could really be a boon to the gaming community. so many gamers could prevent diabetes and other issues by ditching carbs. keep it up  the new channel is awesome.
valkyrie  I lost a fight  turned my back on asgard  ran to a world where I can capture people sell them into slavery making them fight each other to the death in a corrupt system also making them live in appalling conditions so that I can buy booze and die some day and I have never had a redemption arc not to mention I have a bland personality.thor  yeah seems legit  you are now the king of asgard.marvel  this is very empowering.
king valkyrie sounds like a metal band or album title  they re all past their prime now. the original singer was never the same after his 5th stint in rehab and refuses to lose his long hair  now faded and thin like his voice as he promotes himself on images of yesteryear. tragic.
are you familiar with thatstar wars girl if not you should check out her channel. she covers a lot of the same type of social things you do  like this or the lotr stuff . I feel like you two would get along well.
dave here.  dave and his death beanie cant wait to hear   yaaaas  king! slaaaay!  as if people aren t already triggered by being misgendered. anyone else got their popcorn ready for the wokie cannibal zombie flick where they all eat themselves  took the liberty of using my band account and adding to the subscribe count  mel. nexolvus standing by to go boom.
granted in the pirates of the caribbean series they gave elizabeth  keira knightley  the title  pirate king  but they are pirates and they dont play by the normal rules also most of them are drunk high  it was also just to take control of the whole pirate fleet and was more of a general or commander she also put it aside after the battle for a normal life. I do think she should have been referred to as queen and not king but under pirates it does work because it is only a title for battle.this one with tessa thompson does not work because there is the titles king and queen in the culture.
ok  I ll openly admit Im guilty of using a title of  king  on a female character that Imade years ago on da  but at least Im also trying to make a point the way being  king  in the world and such titles revolves on chess rules  kind of . seeing valkerie being supposidly king in the next thor movie instead of thor is a bit  what s the word  dumb  she doesnt strike me as somebody to be fitted to be  king  from the last thor movie.also  I forgot how swoll ryu looks in the trailer. what I need to eat be like that
hillarity is that after all this yakking they re the same one screaming  yaaasss kweeen!  when a female celebrity shows up hyper-sexualised onto the red carpet
one of the things that concerns me is that no matter how much effort I put into making my videogames aesthetic someone somewhere will call me an  ism for failing to do somethingdiet you gave me is working great btw  thanks!
as soon as I heard about this I just hand to face palm. this like the tomb raider situation all over again. people want female characters to be strong  confident and feminine.
the twitter person who brought up that ilyria from angel is forgetting that ilyria is literally possessing the corpse of a woman. ilyria is an amorphous demon God-king that just latched onto the first body itsaw. ilyria never actually identified as a woman  it just uses a woman as a skin suit.
I love when youread psalms. king david was so incredible. he had a gift and divine inspiration. reading psalms always calms me.
getting acne from foods your body doesnt  like I have to agree. I never really thought of it like that. but usually when I eat straight junk I break out. but when I eat clean primarily keto I keep a baby face.
keep up the excellent work  melonie.
thank you melonie your videos helped me get threw a lot in my life your a real lifesaver

y eeeesabut so many people wanna ruin it by erasing it in media or shitting on lewd artists for drawing feminine girls
love the new channel mac! that pic of valkerie is from when flash thompson was on the secret avengers as they dated! flash being my favourite comic book character!!! dudes bad ass! and that ryu we call hot ryu haha there s dlc we I bought  many of like a million season passes lol  and storm collectibles of that ryu which I happily bought haha
tbh Im in the middle  on the one hand I agree it d send a better message for her to be called queen. but on the other hand I think its so ingrained in our heads that king supersedes queen so I guess calling her king makes it clear thatshe is the big boss like she is the one in charge.
tbh Im happy I can click videos like this without thinking  aww shit here we go again  didn t even realize this was a problem until I saw the title scrolled and then was like wait who posted it
okay so Im simping so hard for mel Im not going to call her  muh queen  but  muh king .I love how lego wont go into guns but is totally okay with wokeness. wow.also yes Im joking about simping for mel. or am i
if someone responds to why they are destroying our entertainment with  why does it matter its just ......  respond    if it does not matter or affect anything then why are you doing it
wont lie. upon first glance at street fighter 6  I thought it was hulk and we were getting marvel vs. capcom back. argh.and youre so close to 21k! hopefully you ll pass that by tonight. congrats!  d
I fear no evil for I am fear incarnate! - famous 40k quote
youre so right here. what are they doing messing with the classics
that new valkyrie costume looks like a high school fashion assignment where the kid has to make an outfit out of garbage bags and string
yep  marvel has gone insane  indeed!
they love the exoskeleton suits because it makes cgI look less awkward.
I d love to see how these  artists  that fix other peoples work on twitter would react to someone else de-woking their shit
cant wait for the  yas slay king  part of the movie
marvel confirmed that valkyrie is bImore than 4 years ago.  she is a king looking for her queen  as was stated in a press release by feige 2 years ago. furthermore  it has been argued that in norse mythology  shield-maidens and valkyries were often depicted as a 3rd gender as they represented both male and female qualities. naming this character  king valkyrie  could be a nod to that idea. Im not sure how this plays into the idea that marvel is attempting to  erase femininity  as the title of king doesnt necessary imply that the individual holding that title is masculine. there have been plenty of  feminine  kings throughout history. naming her  queen valkyrie  wouldn t have really changed any of the characteristics of the character either. she d still be a bi-badass warrior regardless.
this is happening in cartoons too  and its horrible.
the director basically admitted at a comic con panel he makes these decisions to make fans mad.
you can be feminine as well as strong  remember susen and lucy from narnia
what a sad mad world we re living in.
just heard about this. the world is going complete bananas.
Im still waiting for valkyrie to get a proper nameshe is a valkyrie  but what s her name
that doesnt make any sense. she cant be king period. her job is her name as well as title. plus she s not a particular strong asgardian  talent wise or ability wise. she was made to guide the souls of the dead  not lead or govern. smdh.
@wolf Lord bradley  mate accuracy to norse mythology is completely irrelevant and redundant  the mcu isn t trying to be accurate. if it was gonna try be accurate then thor and every other norse character would look very very different. as for her fighting skills I really dont know what youre on about  within the mcu the valkyries are clearly depicted as the best of the best when it comes to fighting skills  even thor is amazed when he met her. apart from thor I d reckon she is the strongest asgardian and since he doesnt want to be king of course that make her a good pick.
wtf is 3rd gender
@emma s mom  a gender outside of the typical male female norm. someone who either self-identifies  or society identifies as neither man nor woman.
Im not even surprised. some of the tomb raider devs do the same. they love to hijack things and deliberately make the fans mad
can we say  yasss  slay keeng  now
here s a thought if they are now calling queens kings...and making women  better  by masculizing them. does this mean they are finally admitting that men and women are different and that men are better at nearly every thing the best thing about melanie is her femininity. I love her voice and she s easy to look at to boot  unlike jeremy .
whenever I hear about tessa thompson  I get flashbacks of that photo where she was kissing rita ora and cuddled up to her and taika waititi.  worth noting that rita and taika were dating and tessa was in a relationship with another guy at the time but they d clearly just had a threesome.empowering
so I am a weapons and armour buff. me personally and a number other people in the community of the sword here on youtube do actually kind of prefer more historically accurate armour and find itsexier than the classic fantasy female armour. we do enjoy the fantasy armour but we tend to prefer proper armour.
they already did that a long time ago. they did it with aloy as well.
why they have to dub her as king valkarye what s wrong with calling herqueen valkarye.  melonie for bringing these always enjoying topics from you.I always enjoying learning many thingsfrom you. takecare melonie
I came over from jeremy s channel the day he shouted you out. I was like ok   I ll sub for a few days   see if I want to stay. Ive watched every vid since because I really like your  pov  conversation as well as the verses.  Im not going anywhere but dont comment much.  best wishes for the future of the channel
valkyrie is literally a female term. these wokesters cant even get their own language right lol
good video melonie its like feminity is a curse it is not
love this channel and all your thoughts and positivity! Im later tonight but I am happy to be like number 800!
I love the way you say   squared  I wish I was in math class with you..boppin  with the boom!
50 s conformity lives  it just goes in another direction.
I d like to know how tessa thompson and idris elba  among others  ended up in a movie based on norse mythology...
what happened to our world for real though   this is why I support cg comics gate people I recommend is red gaze and vinnieart they make the best comics go and support em on youtube  hail the gaze agenda hail vinny ! ps great video though !
they re changing jessica rabbitso I bought a jessica rabbitstatue
God bless is american comics film doing everything it canto make anime manga even more successful
it would be cool you could go on evs stream he did a lot of the character that  marvel are changing. good video
hmmm.... now you know why I like supergirl. girl is in the name. I also do a good cosplay of her.
nice tattoo sleeve  good video as always. I like how yourecite a Bible verse at the end of your videos. not religious at all  yet amazed how the verses apply to our modern day soceity.
this is why we mock disney.
freya from gow 2018 or gow ragnor k would kill all those woke characters easily! I like freya s portrayal in those games-she s awesome!
mel  youre an artist. Im a writer. let s team up and make a new comic that just parodies the nonsense that the establishment is pushing. we can start with a protest character in response to king valkyrie named  queen pen-fifteen  and it will be a  non binary robotic writing utensil shaped in the silhouette of male genitals  and he  Imean...she...Imean.... it will be a crime fighter but it cant write ones or zeroes.
when you like a video before the lady even speaks. great day to listen to my favorite hillbilly .  texasstrong.
got no real input here as you and the rest of the comments nailed this on the head  just wanted to say this is a great community and keep up the awesomeness.
you are what you eat  and I am a meatloaf
here is another theory  tessa thompson didn t want to work out so thatshe could pull off that outfit. marvel has forced the male actors to get in shape to play their roles.
another great video
tbh I ain t really trippin . this ain t the first time I seen a female king. that is king ivy  daughter of king dor of xanth.
I will buy your cookbook in a heartbeat 100
I would highly recommend the screwtape letters by cs lewis. it is a step-by-step plan of how the devil will divide the world
the queen of the valkyries is the Goddess  freya  whose beauty was such that the Gods and the giants fought over her numerous times. to call her  king  is a massive insult. additionally  she has never ruled asgard  only the valkyries.
itseems femininity and masculinity are being attacked in every aspect. Im the admin of a discord server for ff14 for people to find irl friends or relationships. so I posted a profile stating my preferences for any intimate interactions is for biological females. I got called transphobic and toxic. I dont hate anyone thats trans. I think they should live their life however they see fit. I just dont want anything romantic with someone that isn t a biological female. the lgbtq community has fought for decades to have their life preferences accepted and respected  but if youre straight and state your preferences then they are all over you about how  toxic  you are. either everyone s preferences should be respected and accepted  or nobody s should.
doesnt thor refer to her as king at the end of ragnarok
man  I dont have an air fryer yet  but just putting a package of ground beef into one of them sounds delicious.
why does valkyrie look like she s wearing a pants suit and why kill ryu gains for but they ll go crazy for kylo ren shirtless scene
they could give her a codpiece like the medieval knights used!
I think ryu 1 is  red meat diet  ryu and ryu 2 is the soy fueled version.
mel  first off  we all  us guys  know youre beautiful so just a heads up that this question has nothing to do with that ..how do you stay warm wearing these tank tops in the middle of winter  no idea how you aren t freezing!!!!
you just earned another subscriber
yeah... valkyrie... I wonder what would they say if someone put a norse girl to play oshun in a movie about the orishas...

I am honestly having a tough time with college right nowmy grade is so bad in english composition  and me being a adhd dysgraphic makes this a living hellso I am withdrawing english for now then I ll take it later when I have better accommodations from the supportive services  put in place for class so I have a better time the next time I take itand if I fail again Im doneIm quitting I cannot take this loop of frustration and stress
apparently  thor is called  thor  and the female version of thor is called  mighty thor . agenda  dont be paranoid!
its funny that if a we complain about a change like this we are told we are misogynistic and its not for us. but when the movie bombs we are called misogynistic for not going to watch it. cade in point ghostbusters 2016
Im the most toxic male ever I open the car door for my wife  they want to kill me for it.
they made valkyrie and jane foster look really bad in thor  love and thunder with the way they abandoned thor during the  flick  scene. I never liked valkyrie  and I never will.
anyone else remember how  in the first episode of  star trek  voyager   janeway asked harry kim to refer to her as  captain   or  if absolutely necessary   ma am   instead of  sir   that was the 90s. good times.
they may neither fail to see it nor not care. they could be bad actors.
look!  its tessa thompson playing....tessa thompson.she has made it clear she doesnt want to work with white people and men - so this role is probably a dream for her.  also with thor giving his hammer to jane foster  natalie portman  another nail has effectively been put in the coffin mcu s credibility and my desire to watch any more of the trash they are putting out.
disney is planning on dying on this woke hill they have made for  themselves
I have alot of stories to tell being a white boy from memphis tn. ive been in bad situations in my life  black and brown are the only people that helped me. I believe in yeshua. we are all human.
the most powerful piece on a chess board is the queen.
6 20 thats not a marvel thing. disney did that to the scarlet witch and black widow when they took over.
as if it wasn t bad enough to race swap valkyrie  now they have to make her masculine too.   facepalm
these people really need to learn some history. if they bothered to do that they would know thatsome of the most figures in world history have had  queen  in their name. its completely ridiculous  but this is the world we live in now unfortunately.
Im done giving wokeness my money. I watched it ruin tomb raider  and thats enough for me to despise it  let alone all the other franchises its worked its way into.
there s no such thing as  toxic masculinity  there is masculinity and not masculinity. if someone wants to be brave  but fails at it and runs away they are not showcasing  toxic bravery  they are showing cowardice.
I just now thought about this but they re doing the same thing to sylvanas in world of warcraft. they covered her boobs up and her stomach as well and also removed photos of females that were in the game. why do they hate females so much
Imay just be an average american but  itseems to me that callingvalkyrie a king seems disrespectful to real life queens ...like maybe ... I dont know ... queen elizabeth the second.she may not be everyone s favorite but she is very respected by her country and quite a few others  and it is considered anhonor just to be in her majesty s presence. I think it would be fair to say she is a powerful woman.God save the queen.
so the queen of england should now be the king of england.
I see nothing wrong with ryuto me he looks more masculine.
dont forget when she got odin s staff   then turned into the allfather in the comics. or was it allmother
yeah  I cant understand why the people who work for marvel are acting this toxic nowadays.
jane foster becomes thor in the comics when mjolnir chooses her to be thor. like she becomes thor in the comics...do you just not like women having lead roles  like I hate to play the misogyny card here  but with comments like this  how can you not
@a fine addition to my collection  because its disney
@jose denis  1  because natalie portman hasn t had a decent perfomance since the professional.  2  dude  the only reason jane foster was given the thor in the comics as well is because those writers are lazy  and it was another way to check a box.  the story was thin and was nothing more than a way to emasculate and deconstruct another well-known male character.  the first issue sold over 100 000 issues and by  10 barely broke 45 000 - because it couldn t keep the majority of those first reader s attention.  people bought that first issue for the same reason the tim drake bI issue and son of kal-el sold a little higher than normal.  not for the story but hoping they could make a few bucks off of it later.  because now  no one cares about these characters or titles. dont presume to school me on this subject matter. 3 tessa thompson is a vocal misandrist  and racist in her own right.  if you hate to play the  misogyny card   then why are you   youre doing the same thing these creators and writers are doing.  being lazy.   oh  I disagree  so I ll use an -ist label to make me look like the white knight swooping in to protect women s rights.  seriously   did you get bored over on twitter trying to berate people you dont agree with and come over here to make yourself feel better about whatever bubble youre living in   because with the comments youre making  I you seem like you lost your way navigating the internet.     all they ve done is another lazy gender-swap for the sake of  representation .  marvel comics writers are lazy.  dc comics writers are lazy.   they dont want to write women as women  this is the whole point of melonie s video and her other content.  this is why the tr games have no solid story and why lara has been slowly being transformed into looking like some generic grad student that is no more memorable than a brie larson movie.  same reasoning behind the  exploring  of queen valkryie s sexuality in this new thor movie.  they fall back on making her a lesbian or bI or whatever because they have nothing else in the story to stand on.  they need something to draw attention to their product  because they know it is sub-par.  thats why movies  american comics  tv shows are of such low quality.  no originality  no creativity.  let s just  reboot    remake    reimagine for the  modern audience and their sensibilities .seems to me that youre just coming in here to cause problems and trash on people to make yourself feel better.  I dont really know if youre watching these videos or just trying to justify your own weak arguments by slamming other people.I love women.  I think women are amazing.  none of us would be here without them.  women deserve the same opportunities as anyone else to succeed.  if they want to fight on the front lines  let em.  if they want to be president  let em go for it.  but dont presume you know anything about me from one comment to come in here and make some random accusation about what you think know.
@son of the red fox  dang thats a lot of text to try and justify a misogynistic comment. I come to these comments to provide counter-arguments and point out inconsistencies in logic. as well as expose outright lies is all. you dont like it  then dont read my comments. I cant help your cognitive dissonance. if you hate women  just come right out and say it. you already doubled down on it in this second post. might as well go full mask off at this point.
and you just proved my point that all you can do is throw a label at people because you dont have anything other than your crusade to  expose lies  to fall back on.  your have no foot to stand on because you have shown your inability and apathy to try and to defend your accusation which is so typical.  if you didn t like my original comment you could have saved yourself some time and just moved on.  but you felt you had to make your point  and you proved you dont know how to make one.  go find somewhere else to spread your hate and generalizations.
@son of the red fox  Imean Im not labeling anyone anything  youre the one making blatantly misogynistic comments here. but in typical fashion you would rather play victim than actually engage in any sort of discussion. unfortunate.
@son of the red fox  Imean if you want I can go ahead and give you a break down of each of your comments and explain to you why they are misogynistic. that way if you truly are this ally of women you claim to be  you at least wont make the same mistake again.
@jose denis  those comics suck and sales proved it. thor isn t a title  its his name. thor odinson. as for women why not storm  or rouge  and by your logic does that mean bucky is the new black panther  seriously though jane as thor sucks its a failed idea and part of the reason manga is kicking marvel and dc s butts in sales. no matter how hard you shill it doesnt change the fact that jane thot and  king  valkerie absolutely suck.
I dont like tessa thompson at all
blizzard wanted to cut back on the sexual content and thought sylvannas outfit was impractical or to sexy I think
if ryu can be topless why cant cammy s liotard shrink
yes  they have do try to erase us  its one of the reasons they make us register to be considered native still and that that registration is dependant on   of heritage.....
in defense of stat trek  you address to your superior officer as sir regardless of gender due to following the naval tradition of calling your co or superior sir cuz it was a male dominated field.
what s the problem with these people first they came with things such as  down with the patriarchy!  and  slay queen! . now they want to call an empowered woman a king
I did the 1 512th irish joke on that video. didn t mean insult or be woke about it. Im sorry if that rubbed you the wrong way. love your contents. thanks for everything so far!
I dont get this.  yes  there have been female rulers who used the male titles when they took power but that was in an era when women couldn t really hold power of that quality  legally.  we no longer live in times like those so the term queen would not be subordinate to king.  probably  they ve done itso when she takes a mate they can call that guy her queen.
this is not thors movie this is his replacement I can see it already
not gonna lie  her being titled as a king was the most feminist thing Ive seen. it literally shows how she is equal to a man-
japan just discovered that car commercial.   wider is better.
well in regards to  king   some cultures did call their ruler  king  regardless of gender. those same cultures didn t have titles such as queen or prince or whatever  just the main ruler title   king . that being said  their reason for it is dumb  they could have come up with some better reason. thats obviously not the same valkyrie as in the comics. in terms of the way she looks and acts.
valkyries are norse.  valkyrie cast as a black woman is flat out offensive to norse people.   black africans have more than enough deep and established culture  sengalese  ethiopian  pygmy  maasaI  and we re missing out on it because of white liberal appropriation.  Im so tired of hollywood s shit at this point.
great video!
just dont ever quit reading the Bible. let Jesus be the source of your strength.
its because you cant have authority without a man s title  thats what their message is apparently.
valkyrie in the mcu was always a complete joke.
king valkyrie... also a black mythological character from the norse mythological pantheon that dates back prior to the 13th century and as far back as the iron age... whose appropriating who here  I bet queen viktoria felt lacking when she was queen of england too  all I ll say about that is she d have said  we are not amused!
I thought that was the hulk !
in fairness  up until recently  a female officer in the usmc was called  sir .and if I recall  in the soviet military  not sure about the current russian military   female officers were also called  the russian equivalent to   sir .just saying...also  we learned that they are terrible with creating new characters.  remember  there was  snowflake  and  safespace  as well as  internet gas .
insert tolkien quote thats been making rounds lately
to be honest  I dont see itso much with the valkyrie images. Imean  clearly the chest is bewbs-shaped suggesting they went with a more feminine style instead of an actually better practical style. but this is the beauty of many people standing together despite their differences  we can disagree without being turds to one another or declaring war. xd
so a normal woman isn t equal to a man  an independent queen isn t equal to an independent king  what s with your wording
@unknown human  im bad with wording lmao
what cultures
yeah   king   being the male form  also functions as the gender neutral form by default in english  similar to how everyone s a  he  unless they re a woman  or how everyone s a  dude  and a  guy  .problem is  the marvel version of asgard has  queen  as the feminine ruling title - so the whole gender neutral king thing doesnt work here.
@jaer nihiltheus  yup. if it wasn t already pre-established  it would be acceptable. but I hate how the woke just change the source material.
even so  if she was named  king  she d lose the title  valkyrie
@aulkraen  yeah  valkyrie isn t a name  and it also isn t her name  her name is brunhilde
ephesians 6 12 - for we wrestle not against flesh and blood  but against principalities  against powers  against the rulers of the darkness of this world  against spiritual wickedness in high places
from my understanding  in military ranks it is appropriate to call a woman  sir  when addressing a superior officer. as far as the rest you are right on. this new  thor movie   if you want to call it that  is going to ratio d to hell when the media hype comes out for it.
it does get tiring
here s what I will say  as someone who isn t that well versed in comics outside of the movies  none of it is erased. the og material hasn t gone anywhere  it hasn t gone into the ethereal plane  its still here. no one said that ender s game erased the book  no one said that hp erased thatseries. I dont know why they went with king over queen  but giving it too much thought seems wasteful. as far as the changes to how females look  Im in the middle as I do  as a male  like female characters to look traditionally female  but there should be a balance as certain games  looking at you dead or alive series  make it a little silly. so tldr  give us a little of both studios.
totally skipping thot love and blunder. gorr is gonna kill the real thor  jane the mighty thot will be  king  valkerie s  queen . this movie isn t for comic fans and isn t for a younger crowd nor is it for mature audiences. its woke trash. sucks too because chris hemsworth is was amazing as thor  one of the best characters ever. Im done with the msheu.
should we refer to the queen of england as king of england now!
I have a different view. Im  by admission  very  very butch  so mcu valkyrie being referred to as a king doesnt really bother me. plenty of female characters in various media have taken on masculine roles and even titles  depending on the work. king from the kof games  for example  is a woman in a masculine tuxedo. another one is integra hellsing  who is often referred to as sir and is also a very masculine woman. also  the og gender bender  mulan. if they were trying to butch up and masculinize an uber femme character like jean grey  storm  or wonder woman  then I d be mad. in this case though  its the mcu version of valkyrie  who is already an alteration of the traditional comics version of valkyrie  who is an alteration of the valkyrie of norse myth. she s a facsimile of a facsimile. at this stage  given that not a lot of info has been given as to why she s given the title of  king of asgard   wouldn t she be a God  asgard is a realm above earth isn t it   in the film  I cant really make heads or tails yet as to why she s referred to as a king  and whether or not its a good thing or a bad thing. I just know gendered roles expectations titles aren t something that hold all that much sway w me  so I am neither for or against it. good vid btw.  -
I d like to see you on fnt.
after seeing the valkyries in God of war 4 and how strong and powerful they are   hardest bosses in the game  yet still feminine  Im very much disappointed in the mcu s iteration. Im not looking forward to this movie. bring femininity back!
hI  melonie!  while I wholeheartedly agree with you that the attempted de-masculinization of men and de-feminization of women by the woke mob is a huge problem  in the case of using  king  for valkyrie  there are many precedents for women being referred to as kings throughout history  from hatshepsut and nefertitI in ancient egypt to king tamar of georgia  the country  not the u.s. state  to king mary of hungary.  thats because in those societies  a queen was specifically defined as the wife of the monarch  and these women actually were the monarchs.  but everything else in today s video was absolutely on point.
if there was context in the comics Imight see why but this makes no sense otherwise.
thor is just thor  whereas the gender swap version of him is  mighty thor   so I guess male thor wasn t that mighty after all. and valkyrie  which should be a title  not a name. so confusing  is a king. just why would they bother with that  plus  they deemed it necessary that a brown woman be the leader of the white norse folk  as the norse ruling family literally just gives up. such disgusting propaganda.
jean grey is gonna be changed and we all know what they re gonna do
they re not calling her king because of anything to do with erasing femininity or seeing a queen as less than  they re calling her king because its funny as her personality and character suit the term king more  because she s a very butch character  its just a jokey name stop being so damn sensitive lmao
I am always pushing like before starting to watch csuse by new I know it will be good
ok...I ll  say  this once... a long time ago the tittle  king  meant ruling crown not male monarch.  poland had a female king.  not sure who or when but she was king not queen
but..if the woman is way more masculine... isn t that toxic then  !  Im just getting too old to understand much of anything anymore I guess.by the way  I recently learned that youre 35. which is sincerely hard to believe...cuz you look 25!!!!whatever your secret is  you need to bottle that up and sell it girl.within a year you ll be a billionaire
wonder what male character they well make a gueen
no one wants to see her become king. fans want thor to be king. preparing for that role was his entire character arc in his past 3 movies.
hey mel please dont get me wrong but I think the movie director for upcoming thor movie want to make women to be king to make the female more powerful   stronger than men   so that is why the movie director wanted to make the female character king   be more powerful   stronger than men in the movies  ok mel. anyway I do hope you understand what I am trying say to you bout this topic  ok mel. anyway hope you have a great evening at home with your pets   have a good night too  ok mel.
never heard of that. if you addressed a female officer with  sir  you d get a 5 min scolding and then your peers would laugh at you.
march 25th!
redheads aren t safe lol
sure it did post a link. the current meaning and historical meaning not some one off from poland  means male.
they call her king  dress her in man s armor  give her a muscular man shaped body  cut her hair short. isn t that just basically a man  I dont understand why they do this.
welp  looks like I am def not watching the new thor. sucks  I was kinda looking forward to it with swoll thor and all.
watching univision last not and realized... this network has it right. femininity and masculinity are alive and well on spanish speaking tv shows......women strong and sexy and the men are actually men!!! shows that the left will never  ever dare cancel!!!!!
the great replacement
that blackwashed character is not my valkyrie
oh good grief
amen!
listen  king is not politically correct. they prefer to be called  crown wearing persons .
she is king lenneth
why why why why.great video snd cant wait to see next

she looks very nordic lol
does it make me gay if I think king valkyrie looks beautiful

when men were queens and women were king and shiiii...
I own all the marvel movies through far from home. Ive been done with marvel since midway through falcon and winter soldier. I do want to see  no way home  but in general I have no interest in future marvel.  breakupdisney

Im of white and latino descent  with 13  indigenous   and Im sick of the woke s  cultural appropriation   that only seems to affect white people  . also  Im done with the woke mcu now  Im watchin  select mcu films only  that ain t woke! .
yikes
good video sis  but let me say a alpha male is a man of God  who actions aren t govern by the world  there for he cannot be a slave of the world  a beta male  is a slave of the world  he chases the addictions of the world that are natural or man made  drugs  sex  entertainment   anything else that can please his ego  in the Bible Jesus says he is the alpha omega me   the father are one  so those of us who follow him  strive to be alpha   lead by good example of what we preach  love is truth  sacrifice  forgiveness  charity  this is how you know a man is alpha or loves you  through his actions not his words.
some are doing this because it is trendy. some are doing this because they want to get attention or not  rock the boat . these people are oblivious midwits or useful idiots. but plenty are doing this intentionally as a means to normalize all kinds are ideological viewpoints  regarding biology  norms  reason  truth  crt  and provoke change they believe is good. we should call it out  mock and satirize it. it needs to be called out  like you are doing.
bro its s fictional character
kangz valkyrie!
the mcu ended at infinity war  half of everyone died. the end. even ragnorak  gets worse every time I re-watch it.
fast foods are bad mainly because allot of substandard ingredients are used. mcdonalds hamburger is not even fit for human consumption is only made so using a chemical its fda  approved . its got the consistency of wet cat food when they press it into patties. I cant eat mcdonalds without having to take a trip to the bathroom shortly after. burger king  I find the burgers actually taste allot better. it actually tastes like meat. also  the burgers look allot more like what they show on tv. wendy s is good for pretty much the same reasons as burger king. but the thing with fast food its meant to be a on a occasion thing  its never meant to be a thing you eat 3 times a day like a normal meal every day.
storm ends up bein the queen of wakanda so let s hope dey stikk 2 dat  she s always been sexy n powerful
please get ahold of the quartering
I gotta figure that out. its supposed to be synced but I guess its not  I ll look into it tomorrow
so the queen has no value.
ya ill be skipping this one.
offended as white and norwegian
and I shall put emnity between the you and the seed of the women...  erase the women  erase the seed.
I dont like the street fighter look because ryu looks like he has roid gut. I dont mind that he is bigger just fix the roided bubble gut... see joe rogan for reference
I see what I skip next.in name of non-woke
I just wonder if there are anymore straight women of color superheroes in these shows and movies anymore...
the only female king I recognize is jadwiga of poland. mainly because the poles didn t have a word for queen at the time.
its no big deal. let it crash and burn. marvel disney has been trash for a while now and just keeps banking on nostalgia and brand recognition. ignore it  let it die  and give new creators and ideas a chance.

queen elizabeth is not powerful as per their logic... hahahahaha! itshould be king elizabeth. lmao
purple haired wookiee s are the worst.
all this talk of food is making me want to go watch some carnivore-based cooking videos....new content idea
sooo  a king can be strong  but a queen cannot. how sexist of marvel to do this.
tbh marvels thor is a disgrace to norse mythology.
done with mcu and their woke hate filled bs. as tolkien said evil cannot create  it can only destroy or corrupt.
um.... no  no it isn t. there s been loads of stories where women have claimed the title of  king  and no one made a big deal about it or even batted an eye then. why is itsuddenly a problem now  Imean  look at fate stay night. arthur pendragon was genderbent into artoria pendragon and was a  king . even though she identifies as female  she still refers to herself as a king. no one complained about it then  why should it be a problem now  what about the myriad of fantasy anime  many of those have antagonists going by the name demon king or demon Lord despite them being female demons. no one complains about it there  so why is it a problem with thor love and thunder   melonie  do yourself a favour and just.... dont be an anti-sjw. they re not insightful  they re not analytical  they re not even good people. they re just a bunch of overreactionary people filled with rage  hatred and a major chip on their shoulder. please dont fall into that category  Im sure youre better than that.
really liking the content but its a bit too long.I find myself pitting off your vids because of it.
wow she is so nordic... not. king ffs. another foobared franchise.
antI sjw sjw people have just becomes terrible shadows of there former selves but I think the reason why itseems like a problem is cause of all the controversy of female character being made to look more mainly and king being a commonly known male term despite it meaning ruling crown a long time ago most people today would think there calling her king for no reason it has more to do with how its looked at now by most people
@yu lee  except  again  thor love and thunder isn t the first to do it. other shows have done it before and didn t face backlash or ridiculous claims like  erasing  feminity. I dont think anti-sjws anger towards this is justified.
@thunder goku  I dont doubt your right
there s a reason arthur was genderbent. do you know why  because the author thought the story wouldn t work with two male protagonist  so he made the summons gender bent to keep his main protagonist male. everything you said is invalid due to thatsmall piece of information. I wouldn t call myself an antI anything  but Im definitely against sjw s. Im definitely against this trash liberal message of pushing women in shitstories. Im tired of forced diversity and preaching from celebrities and politicians. I basically disagree with the liberal mindset on everything and not because Im a disagreeable person. I just find them to be objectively wrong  with no ability to think  only the ability to emotionally respond with hate and the same illogical  tired rhetoric.
@wolf Lord bradley  oh stop being a baby. nothing about this is sjw in the slightest  youre just throwing a tantrum over a woman with the title of king  despite it happening in tons of other stories before and no one seemed to mind.also  youre wrong. the original concept of fate did not have two male protagonists. the original protagonist was a girl named ayaka.
the real valkyrie is an awesome character.  then they imported some south american lesbian to play her and made her the leader of asgard...its inexplicable and stupid.
you clearly don s understand what is meant by toxic masculinity. masculinity is not toxic inherently but certain behaviors that are considered to be masculine can be toxic.
I dont like tessa at all. I dont think shes a good actress in any movie Ive seen her in. and can we stop making white characters black
its the worst idea its making me not want to watch it
I was kinda worried this would be some red pilled loser who s a guy talking some dumb stuff about wokeness. glad I watched the whole video
I thought this is what you wanted. females in the place of a male roles right  isn t queen like second in line. just saying.
ppl like her can dream all they want. a woman is not a king  and never will be looked upon as one. tt is nothing be a diversity queen.
Im sorry but valkyrie should be the whitest actress possible. Imean is norse mythology ffs
thanks for saving me the time and money I d of wasted on this garbage. woke disney has destroyed the mcu. Im not watching lotr  woke of power either.
they just want to shit on white norse mythology by having a black woman play this character and call her  king .
I fucking hate what they ve done to thor and the entirty of the marvel asgard mythos. Im not going to watch this movie after seeing what they did in ragnarok and endgame
thor was barely thor in his first movie and he s only gotten worse with every movie. I hate ragnarok and fat thor in endgame. tessa s valkyrie is an absolute abomination and spitting on the characters from the comics.
raceswape was a total disrespect katheryn winnick from vikings should have been valkyrie not tessa thompson from dear white people. and hafthor bjornsson should have been heimdall
eyy
the original blonde haired  valkyrie would be queen!  I d rather prefer that ! then the woke mcu bull shit valkyrie!
comment!
just means we have a shity person playing a shity character in a movie Im not planning on watching anyway. the mcu is done.
lara croft should be a man. women cant climb mountains! or hunt treasures..
so disney craping on north methology . disney do not crap on outer colture for yoru woke agenda. cultror aproiation disney
I love thor   but I have zero interest in this woke garbage! what a discrase!
I never asked for this lol
this is total garbage! why are they doing this  I dont understand. I dont want to watch this movie and wont.
