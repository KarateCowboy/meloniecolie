frosk has caused more harm to the female employees in g4tv  and women in gaming in general than actual sexism in gaming
let s not forget g4 supported her rant. they deserve everything they get or dont get.
replace her with melonie mac and I will watch g4tv
if they got rid of her immediately following her idiotic rant they might not be a sinking ship right now.
Im glad more women like you are stepping up the plate with honest and blunt opinions. it helps to shatter the constantly framed narrative of victimhood culture and show that women are fully capable of being independent and confident  without the need to blame others for their roles in life. keep being honest and sincere  so hopefully you can inspire more women to speak up  rather than letting some activist speak for them.
this isn t about her opinions  its about her complete lack of tact and professionalism. she could have made her point without poisoning the well. her lack of self awareness extends far back into her lol caster days. she s always been a toxic person who cant stand criticism and plays the sexism card every time she is confronted about her sub par performance. its beyond me why they even hired her in the first place given her past with the lol community. the best thing g4 can do is fire her for making that tweet  and make it very clear to every single employee that lost their job that day thatshe was fired for specifically making that tweet.
g4 should ve fired her after her first rant.she s entitled to her opinions  but thatstuff just hurt their brand.their mistake was keeping her on and de facto defending her by doing so.
wondering how many of the staff that cheered her on when she went on her rant survived.
g4  ign and gamespot are some of the reasons that I am grateful for channels like this and geeks   gamers.
they literally gave her a 2nd chance and she still blew it and it took more than a year for frosk to finally get the axe. after the ceo and numerous other people had to leave the company.  and for the company to suffer major losses.  only then  did they finally get rid of her.   its unbelievable how stupid these people are.
she was so concern on owning her  haters  thatshe was so tone-deaf about her fellow employees.  sad all others had to suffer for her terrible rant.
having worked in tv and radio  I know all too well how people say all sorts of things about you and to you. Ive had journalists completely rewrite my responses in interviews. some of the worst  most untrue statements came from people close to me who thought they were helping me out. it is unfortunate  but it is part of the job and if you dont know that going in  then youre either naive or a fool.but it is never appropriate to rant at the viewers as a block. in my experience  its best to not even mention it publicly.
Ive never heard of frosk until just now and I feel like thats probably a good thing.also  you dont need to dunk on people to discuss the things that happen to them  even if its their own doing. you generally have the correct tone and approach to these stories.
rip in piece brave stunning g4 frosty guy.
she deserves everything she gets.
melonie  you are there to be easy on the eyes for everyone in your own way and to make good content. keep it up.
thanks  great commentary  and compassionate view  as much as she earned this it is wise to remember many have lost their jobs over her mishandling of the brand. truly unfortunate for so many. also  spot on we are all flawed  and best if we could all just improve. earned my subscription
frosk is the one person that will land on their feet out of the whole sorry mess - you dont need to feel bad for her being fired. she will get hired by the next dumpster fire in waiting off her victim cred and be just fine. perhaps not by a kotaku or ign etc  they re probably in a death spiral of their own and dont have money to spare  plus frosk isn t actually qualified to write even for them  probably a esport outfit Im guessing will end up with her. now g4 on the other hand  thats already a shell of what it was  completely gutted of staff and probably with no income from the parent company and no views to support it. now it gets to try to eke out its busted business model with no  talent  to produce the way too expensive skits etc.really the only take home is the hipocrisy of frosk from the whole mess. supposedly the entirety of the audience was  internalized mysoginists  because we shouldn t have called frosk out for having a bad ill informed take then reading the rest of the meat of the games details she was  reviewing  off a script prepared for her. it was prepared by perfectly capable staff members - who happened to be half of them female - that had actually played said games themselves and day to day held the auto cue up  ran coffee etc for frosk and sessler etc. in 2022 in this internet age there is absolutely nothing stopping any one of them from presenting a channel themselves and doing those reviews. in fact had they represented g4 and done that from their bedrooms  calling themselves the talent of g4  the views may well have supported the channel. those unfortunates happend to be the ones fired in the mass cull. here we get to frosks tweet.that directly shI ted on all those staff  women included that propped frosk up and that we were supposedly  mysoginist  for not seal clapping as frosk parroted their hard work. frosks tweet actively celebrated their firing. she may have  owned the chuds  in her mind  but also at the expense of actively dunking on all those supposed women in arms thatsupposedly was her entire point in being on the staff. frosk just doesnt have a leg to stand on.
dont believe she s fired until g4 comes out and says she is no longer part of the company. its possible that there is restructuring going on behind the scenes and she ll be back with something different  under the same company - when that comes up  she and her fans will utterly and completely spin this to their own benefit.so dont believe this is real until its actually confirmed.
you dont  I enjoy tf outta this. sooner or later these companies need to stop hiring ppl like her they mean nothing but destruction and anyone in the mix that never called her out they got serve with her
she predicted it causing a divide  she was just wrong who the one throwing out insults actually is
I think frosk s role in these firings is overstated  the channel was already withering on the vine before the rant. g4 simply had far too many employees for a small youtube channel.but I do agree that frosk s rant did nothing to improve the lot of women in gaming. it was shrill  petty and condescending  and thereby only desensitised the audience to any genuine complaints female gamers might have.
I think the outrage media this past 5-7 years is what really set women back in a lot of areas. frosk is just the tangible manifestation of it and the worst of the worst. before this skeevy mess happened  I never cared who was in the leading role or hosting  male or female. now  I when I see a woman being a lead in more nerdy areas  I really do have to think twice.
when you get so woke you became antI woke
frosk  anita and zoe are detrimental to women in gaming period. if anything  they cause people to be more misogynistic and thats probably their goal for their grifting. now anything that has a female or lgbt or maybe a minority will be viewed in bad faith if they look a certain way. not all of them  but most
its not hard to do more than zero
a question -- do you think its more accurate to say that indiana  froskurin  black has brought more harm to male female relationships in general than if she had never gotten involved at all. while many people are mature enough to see she s part of a deranged group of people and work past that  there will be a handful of people who will hold her up as proof that  all men are pigs  and  all women are grifters.   personally  I dont think she even cared.  it was all a grift for self-promotion.
they re the same picture...
I want a scooby doo ending where these civil rights heroes unmask themselves.
@gryffen  Im pretty sure she is. her rant wasn t even planned  the remaining staff hated her for it and now g4 might go belly up her impulsiveness and the company siding with her
100  correct.
agreed. there is no separating them now. the name company is radioactive now. will still take years for this to wash off.
@part stupid  they were kind of doomed from the start. most have moved on from g4. but your point is taken.
this is the way
melonie probably makes more money on youtube.
I consider that an upgrade
who s melonie mac
you mean melonie snac
if that happens I dont know if she will take the offer ultimately its her choice
Im still not gonna watch g4   they re gonna have to do more then replace frosk and apologize. they made there bed now they have to lie in it
they cant afford her
deal!
bars
imagine melonie mac with angry joe  and act man talkin in the same room
oh shit  right lol
they still would have to fire that raving lunatic adam sessler before I would even click on their channel icon.
I just discovered the channel and I cantell she s already more qualified and charismatic than frosk.frosk had issues in the past that got her kicked off a pro league of legends team  so I have no idea why they thought it was a good idea to let frosk be the face of the brand.
yes  mel would be sooo good for this job at g4!
yep.
no fr
e
@albert nada retro  yeah  melonie would definitely be a good addition to g4 and she ll be a great host and will probably be able to hopefully bring back the old tone and atmosphere and put things right again there  because its been really bad at g4 with everybody having the same opinion all the time and them trying to silence you if you dont have the same opinion as them!
let g4 die. it was fun in its time  but times have changed.
yeah she s more easy on the eyes  mainly saying that as a jab to frosty froskin
now there s an idea!
I couldn t agree more.
nah dont degrade her like that man
she s to genuine for thatshitshow.
ya mon
@coolin1stplace  I agree. but thats the thing  with her being so genuine and fun  she d be perfect to host.
no the rest of the crew thatsupport fork during her rant is still there.
@jdhi5  I hear ya. but working for them would mean limiting the topics the she can speak about.
@pablo pesquera  angry joe  didn t he died  if not the dude is irrelevant for over a decade
yep!!!
@coolin1stplace  very true.
I didn t know g4 was still a thing  until frosk fucked up
yessssssss
na g4 sucks she s doing better free from tyrant sessler
g4 has been so damaged  reputation wise and financially that I wouldn t recommend anyone that wants a career to go there. staying independent and building your own community with youtube and such is the best move right now
hell yeah.
melonie mac has better viewer analytics  she d be taking a hit.
@taesire jasper  that happens everywhere  melonie mac s discord twitch chats are mostly right wing based and they will try to get you banned or kicked out if you argue and disagree with them
adam sessler would have a twitter rage meltdown.
who !
annonying voice thi
bro I d watch the 6pm rush hour traffic sitstill on the highway if this presenter was in the frame
thats how you save g4!
no I d rather have morgan web
if they had done that in the first place  itshould have been followed up with a post saying thats why they fired her.
yes  and they should have sent adam with her. both have exposed themselves as horrible people happy to bring their views into the company.
she did not get fired  they are suggesting thatshe did and keeping her out of the spotlight in the hopes that things will turn around for them. once they do  then they can and will bring her back
tbh only firing frosk would not have fixed their broken business model. had they used the rant as a pretext to fire frosk and 80-90  of the staff  and had they then rebranded with amouranth ballpitshenangans  then maybe they could have turned the ship around.g4 was already failing before the rant. they were following an older cable tv business model on a platform where youreally cant expect that much ad revenue unless youre pewdiepie.
@baronstone  she s definitely out. fired  probably  but not confirmed.
nah  long term they would ve still failed. the format is just not sustainable in today s world. individual  content creators far eclipsed this big media company thing.
na  that was always gonna happen. frosk just only speed up the process  but the channel was always a dead on arrival. the enormous expenses of many many staff  studio etc. compared to the revenue  then the entire channel is set up as if it was still the late 90 s early 2000 s. where you have a crap lot of filler content that has nothing to do with games at all. then you got adam sessler reviewing old games instead of current day... because reasons    and then you get the frosk rant... and its not just the frosk rant  its the fact that everybody joined in with her  the entire cast.... followed up with the shenanigans of the other on show employees.
the ship was already sinking  she just made it go down a few months earlier.
@aliradicali  finally someone with a brain.
I never realized how much they play the victim until talking to some on twitter recently they cant take criticism then accuse you of anything lol I asked someone why they liked a show just curious and they were like how dare you force someone to explain why they like a show haha like wtf
@d  its like  all of the woke ness and grievance paddling that is so en vogue right now has made a certain segment of people just extremely reactionary. its very distressing to see how ready people these days are to take offense at basically anything.
@batou1976  true its like they live in a bubble of delusion and if anything threatens that it must be attacked or blanked out Ive noticed a lot of these people bloke other people randomly lol like if your not being harassed by someone blocking them is just childish
@d  I would agree that blocking someone just because you cant handle that they have a different opinion from you is childish for sure. but I sometimes block people on social media because I see a post by them that is either so stupid or so vile that I say  wow  I dont ever want to be exposed to anything this person has written ever again.
@batou1976  yeah that ones fair enough aswell personally I d just ignore them basically same thing lol
@d  well yeah there s plenty of people I also just ignore. the ones I block is because not only do I not want to ever see anything they ve written again because it was just so stupid or reprehensible  but I dont want to take any chance of them deciding to respond to something I write and thus me having to deal with them.  proactive headache prevention.
@batou1976  lol good idea Im too lazy for that
aren t polish tamales just holishkes
eh its also about her toxic opinions
she s entitled to her opinions  more like  she s entitled to her opinions    here fixed.
@psycho drummer
yeah they sealed their own fate after that rant.  I wasn t inclined to watch g4 before the rant  but following it and g4 s support for it  I was definitely not gonna watch
everyone is entitled to their opinions  but opinions are not without consequences either way when your job is representing something bigger than yourself.
@psycho drummer  yeah and thats the problem of course.still I dont think she or anyone else should be gagged from having personal opinions. there should be a clear divide between personal opinions and professional life.frosks problem is thatshe couldn t make that distinction. and that eventually made it g4 s problem as a whole.I dont think she should ve been fired over anything she might ve said on her own twitter account for example. thats none of her employers business. but she made the choice to rant while on air at g4 tv  which she had no right to do. and thats why she should ve been fired right afterwards.
but they couldn t fire her right away or else they be labeled as  gasp  ..sexist
they were already failing before the rant. they had far too many staff to support their pitiful view numbers and their growth was completely stagnant. in a way  the rant would have been the perfect opportunity to fire frosk and most of the staff and rebrand into their amouranth ballpit routine. the rant certainly drew vastly more attention than the relaunch itself did...
@bassman 81  so let s say I was the ceo of the company  I would ve fired frosk after her first rant  citing the fact that a company oriented towards gamers cant just sit by and watch one of the hosts shittalk out main demographic.and if the feminists starts to complain and accuse me of sexism  all I d sy is  Im sorry you feel that way  but the decision stands  and refuse to elaborare further.Im willing to bet that I d be viewed far more favourable by the vast majority of the audience doing that.
@seven proxies  oh you d definitely be viewed in a positive light by normal sane people but the loonies would be calling for your head.
@aliradicali  or... you know... they could ve just tried to revive the old format of g4tv  the way the audience actually liked it.
@bassman 81  hehe  let them. Im used to it. besides  when it comes to the internet  doing some high publicity trolling would never really hurt your efforts. quite the opposite.
@seven proxies  thatship had sailed by the time of the rant. I d argue that their brief foray into boobie-streamers afterwards was a stab at returning to the old format  but they never comitted to the bit  they never fired frosk and they didn t cut their staff numbers.it was simply impossible to run a youtube channel as though it were a small cable tv network.
the  rant  was entirely scripted.  the cast as crew all supported it.  if anyone was going to get fired it would have to start with their production and executives because they doubled down on the frosk rant.as for their  brand   it was a rebranding of a previous  successful product.  the veneer is  g4 .  the brand is just more woke agenda  leftism  feminism  misandry  gamer-hating .  I think we ve seen enough from star wars  cara dune gina carano   gamergate  the last of us 2  netflix  pick one   marvel phase bore m-she-u  et al.
assuming the receptionist cheered  she might still be around.  somebody always has to answer the phone  manage the social media pages  and respond to group email.
they re probably all scared if her and just tried to ignore it and talked behind her back  they seem like that those kinds of people.
@al bino  so  typical urban californians.
its ok to celebrate when good things happen. this is a good thing.
to be unreasonably fair to frosk  she s not the main reason those people got fired. g  had a ludicrously unsustainable amount of staff for what amounts to a small yt channel in terms of viewers. even a massive channel could not support that many employees and still be profitable  pewdiepie is a millionaire because he has barely any overhead.frosk s rant was a desperate last effort to gain relevance that backfired completely.but it did give them an opportunity to tunr things around  had they fired frosk and most of the staff in response to the giant backlash  I think they could have had a shot at rebranding.
yes this! with her experience Im still surprised at how unprofessional she is. she needs pr training bad

lets face it melonie is extremely beautiful no need to beat arround the bush
haha thank you!  d
melanie mac is fine like a nice pinot grigio wine
@melonie mac go boom  let loose the simps of war!
morgan web  oliva munn  and melonie mac go boom were not made to be easy on the eyes for you!
@cmcadvanced
@cmcadvanced  here here!!!!
@lcars data node  um  yes they are  but they also are cool and know their shit  unlike frosk! munn  webb and mac could definitely be a nice female trio!
she is a beautiful  young native and does not exist for you to stroke your coup stick to!
@nightbreed24  too late.  already happened.  twice.
craziest thing is shes 35  thats about 10 years older than I expected her to be.
@nightbreed24  that is for me to decide! not you!
@lcars data node  God said otherwise when he created them and gave me an attraction to them!
its been officially reported in a town hall meeting with investors according to kotaku.  comcast bought out her contract and she was made to leave the building.
she literally made herself not bankable on top of what she exclaimed about her not being easy on the eyes.
been watching you since frag dolls  keep up the great work. absolutely love that you went independent and now speak your mind  so fun to watch.
frosk may have prevented anyone from watching g4 again. but it was really the higher-ups that used the channel s nerd culture into another cheep political stunt is what really killed g4 and led people to geeks gamers and friday night tights.
Im glad you went out on your own. I didn t see any of the other stuff that you did until this channel.
you are so right about this melonie. I love you letting loose and sharing your opinions with us. take care and stay cool melonie
honestly melonie Im glad you dont do what other people have done on the subject its less in your face about  getting owned  and more on the purpose of plus a reason why frosk got canned you even talked further on all the g4 side not just frosk. thank you for giving a full view no just a frosk pinpoint.
g4tv was basically done for the moment that they hired frosk as a hosts for their show. I was going to watch thatshow. till this individual made that rant. lol
appreciate your take in that you are not actually celebrating the prospect of her getting canned  but exploring the conditions of her possible dismissal. - not rendering evil for evil   relatively so-to-speak
I grew up with g4 seeing shows like portal  judgment day  the arena and now its heartbreaking to see it fall apart  because of so much including this.I am mostly saying silent. Im a man so my opinion is not worth much  until the moment it becomes valuable  but only someone  popular  says the exact same thing. so once again  I stay silent because nothing I say is important until spoken by someone else.
amen melonie. im glad to see your response to this. God bless you always and I know you ll keep rising
shes not fired they are just taking the heat off of her  continue to push!
well  you are a better person than me. I chuckled a little. no party or celebration. it is unfortunate for her that her career is probably shot. but after that horrific and disgusting post about surviving the train wreck thatshe did so much to help cause  I did chuckle a bit at the news she may have been fired.
as much as I love frosk when she s not being a total tool bag all tools  not just one  I dont think she s going to learn her lesson
you get what you f cking deserve  -joker
I would really like an explanation from frosk as to how what she thinks happened to g4 and her colleagues  is she so far gone thatshe cant wont see thatshe literally torpedoed an entire company  is she willing to admit to herself and others thatshe effectively took away countless people s jobs and livelihoods  I just seriously wanna know how she feels when she looks in the mirror and what she thinks others see her as after treating the people around her so poorly.
melonie youre such a sweetheart. God bless you and your good heart. youre absolutely right. as well deserved as her firing was  its not right to celebrity someone else s firing. love your content
she tanked the entire channel singlehandedly and didnt get canned immediately because of her flag
think about heading your own video game panel show and put the final nail in g4s coffin. put your experience as former frag doll and gamestop ambassador to good use and call in favors from the fandom menace to assist. if simpcast  fnt and open bar aren t offering you a permanent spot  make your own mark and you ll be surprised at the support you ll get.
haven t gotten any notifications from you for a long time. huzzah to frosk getting the boot. dont know if they will be able to recover from the damage done  though. they probably didn t fire her  though. just moved her off of the screen.. because she would sue for raycisms if they fired her.
I figured out what frosks favourite food is her own foot in her own mouth... sprinkled with a pinch of basil.
facts
I stopped watching g4tv when literally everything about gaming was replaced with cops  cheaters  ninja warrior. I want to watch a gaming network for gaming not some reality crap.
both of those channels were already doing fine before the frosk fiasco. it was just grist for the mill to them and all the other gaming and geek yt channels.
she is fired. it has been confirmed.
I love how  I survived   turned into I fired  edit  Im new to your channel and I actually dont like punching down. yes  frosk deserves it  if she really got fired  but people shouldn t throw a party over someone s loss. banter and a little smack talking is fine. if g4 actually  apologized to their fans  publicly announced that they fired her and are going to fix it  then fans might be a little forgiving.
I guess you randomly showed up in my feed because I was checking out the news about g4   but I ll say its refreshing to see a real woman with a real mind of her own and can create her own opinions even if alot of women or people in general would probably defend fisk or w.e her name is lol  just becz she the same sex as them or maybe has a belief they do  you know the types  that just blindly defend or regurgitate what someone says just because its popular belief or becz that person has something in common as you luke sex  race  nationality  anything. you are the first person I heard actually say though that people were calling her ugly and attacking her in the comments  so I didn t know why she just went on that unhinged  rant but so now I understand why she was a bit emotional at the time  but even still  thats no excuse for how she acted and what she doesnt understand how comments work  u r reading one person s opinion that they share when they k ow noone k ows its them  u dont think ur gonna find some sexist  racist  just close minded opinions in general. they re the comment section Imean cmon..
if its official then she basically canceled herselfwhich is hilariously amazing.
finally. just sucks they fired a bunch of other people that weren t the issue  but because of her actions she destroyed the network resulting in people getting fired.
its official  frosk is fired!  frosk just tweeted a thank you notice to g4tv  xplay and esports. she said thatshe  loved working with you guys  and she especially will miss gex.  who is gex
I dont see how someone like frosk can have friends.
kotaku posted a  confirmation  of her  leaving  g4 2 hours ago. neat.
just stumbled across your channel  I love it! keep on keeping on  homeslice
g4tv would have been better off hiring melonie! she knows her gaming more than frosk ever did. melonie wouldn t need a script to read from.  but then  I highly doubt they would want her there. her views dont align with theirs. melonie is doing awesome going boom on her own channel! keep up the great work melonie!
and balance was restored to the force. one hour ago she posted this on twitterthank you so much to @g4tv and the talented xplay and esports departments! loved working with you guys. gonna especially miss gex!  3
wonder if this is a  fishing expedition  on g4s part. saw the other vid from jeremy that made it look like they want people to think she s fired. they ve already proven they are capable of shady behavior with frosk s rant and the bot scandal on twitch. I wouldn t put it past them.
when they did the g4 holiday special comeback announcement steam thing I watched that like 15 times so excited...and her we are now lmao
you could tell some people during that rant knew there would be consequences
good for her
I hope she learns a lesson and betters herself after this.
I think the john cena meme should be sent to frosk s I survived post  are you sure about that . I think you are right mel we shouldn t be taking pleasure in her losing her job or anyone who was fired.
been following from the beginning.  and I like the straight up  old school commentary of  no bs - this is whats up.   frosk went the wrong way and should have owned her brand  her style  and her experience.  instead she lashed out and had a bunch of sycophants  seal clap   for her and now they re out of a job.  two sides of the same coin.  frosk blames you for her failures.  mac says f-u this is what I think and go boom!  I take the mac over froskbitten any day.
knowing g4  they probably promoted her to ceo.
if g4tv made you and morgan webb the new cohosts for x-play  I d watch that.
frosk gets fired jeremy clarkson  oh nooooooo... anyway
honestly  I found your channel because of jeremy. hopefully you do get more opportunities to host events. you have a fun personality.the problem with frosk will always be  she did something stupid. g4 got caught not doing good reviews and using each others work. when called out about it  sexism in gaming  men are gross  its just a review.then g4 s team doubled down on it.now  I think we can all admit  some guys boys can just be gross. maybe 1-5  of her char were these gross things. the issue is this has 0  to do with their bad reviews and is a shit deflection.I dont want her to loose her job but at the same time did the other people who were fired deserve to loose their jobs because of her  or in other words was it worth keeping her this long if it tanked the entire company this is a male dominated space. its not pretty  nice  or fanciful. its gritty  name calling  hellscape of fun. we want people to join  but if you cant hang  please leave. dont try to change our space for you.  either be like melanie who s got bigger balls than half the guys on xbl or gtfo.surprised there wasn t some scripture at the end. not a believer but I would imagine in times like these  people who do  could use it more. have a great one hun!
Imade sure to subcribe to g4tv when I heard the news  and thought it was be funny to mention why I re-subbed on there live shows due to her being gone without even mentioning her name  but the damn mods keep telling me to stop. and I told them   I guess I ll mention it once per week instead of once per day  is that good for you   but screw it  Im going to mention it once per day  everyday when I can  no harm done. example  I upvoted your video because I support your channel now due to a certain someone not being there anymore. you have my support.   meanwhile mod saying  you already said that yesterday.   - ron swanson
I respect you for not celebrating her being fired. there are only a handful that deserved to be fired more. she singlehandedly burned g4 to the ground.
frosk did this to herself. she deserves the roast.
they made the right decision  too bad it took so long. now time to watch the chrissie mayr frosk impression again!!!
adam sessler really ran g4 into the ground in less than 10 months lol
I understand g4 is a relic of the late 90s and 2000s but I grew up with xplay and would love a show just like xplay and attack of the show.kevin is perfect for that job and so was olivia.Imiss that era.games and inappropriate humor is my thing.I wish the show came back like the  g4 reunion special .it must be kool to get your old friends together to try and recreate something awesome suxs it failed
frosk had a lot of nerve to post that  I survived  post after so many people got laid off only because of a situation she started. she got what was coming to her. the only thing bad about it was thatshe should have been one of the first that was laid off. Im happy that the douche got what she had coming.
frosk   I survived!g4 bosses   oh sorry  we forgot to give your pink slip here you go!
I survived  aged like fine milk.
honestly Im not rooting rooting anyone to loose their job but after that rant she went on Im not surprised thatshe got fired  assuming she got fired. just surprised it took this long
if I remember correctly  didn t she single handedly kill g4tv after it was already barely limping along.
I think they got rid of her because it was unprofessional for bragging. I also think alot of the reason she was left go is all over her attitude. they should hire you on g4  and put some light back into the channel  that is if they are still around. maybe g4 is trying to send a message to people like her  maybe those people will get the picture. either way itsounds like  you sounds unhappy with being apart of any big channel.
and here I didn t even know g4tv was still in business.
nice to see women didn t like what she did either. I was blown away when someone told me about that video when it happened and my first thought when I seen it was  there done .
I d let this story ripen just a bit. but if true  well  couldn t happen to a better person.
I need a geek girl like you in my life.. love your body art work.
I think her bragging about not getting fired got her fired.
im glad you dont go hard on roasting people  its good to keep a level head on topics  so just keep calling balls and strikes as you see fit.
she tweeted about an hour ago confirming she s no longer there.
its ok to celebrate when something good happens. this is good.
and if they had done this in january they might even have saved the company. oh well. c est la vie!
I dont like seeing people get fired either.but I love it when people get what s coming to them  even if that is a firing.
frosk posted a message on twitter saying farwell to g4tv
I often wonder what happened to the concept  the customer is always right   meaning you cater to your customer or audience s needs not yours. when I was a teen working my first job as a bag boy at a grocery store the first thing I learned was the customer was always right even when they are wrong. why  because if you want to keep your customers that provided money for goods and services which kept the lights on and provided you with a steady paycheck you had to make sure their experience with the establishment you work for was a pleasant one so they would be a repeat customer. by all accounts it was a good business model and provided success for business s for hundreds of years. but now we have people who think they can call their audience customers anything they want  tell them to leave and still make money. I am not sure when common sense stopped being taught but there are a lot of grown adults  I use that term loosely  that dont use it or have no critical thinking skills for that matter. it is like watching the country slide into the movie  idiocracy .
not presumable   they bought out her contract and had her perp walked out the building lol
I honestly wish that they d hire melonie mac as their leader lmao.
I know you!   you are that little butter eating girl from instagram!  lmao  I dont know why I have not subscribed until tonight.  I think you are right about not roasting frosk. for as nice as it would be to take a victory lap its probably better to just watch and eat popcorn quietly.
damn  she celebrated after her supposed friends gabbie  zipper  and cufflink got fired. guess frosk had it coming.she probably already has multiple offers from polygon  kotaku  and naughty dog to come tank their business.
I wanna see chrissie make fun of frosk on friday night tights saying how she got fired.
reminds me I have to watch the frosk rap video again.
whole thing is sad. frosk was indoctrinated. she could just be a happy gamer and be admired. she used to.Im sorry for frosk. hopefully she ll find it in her to be humble and turn things around.
I think they just took her off xplay as a host but she s still working for them on their esports stuff  which is why her twitter bio still has the g4tvesports channel....but thats just my thought on this.
question is now  which company will she destroy next
after your legendary burn the other day there was literally nothing else they could have done.also melonie mac for g4tv  no filter no script and a fat fat wallet.
I would go mock her but she probably already deleted her social media in shame.
that response by az! the big lad really has no middle range  does he
its never good to see things like this happen  but the sad truth is thatshe brought a lot of it on herself... it is what it is. nobody should be celebrating something like this  but I dont blame anyone having very little empathy for her hardship.
2 16  Im glad zipper survived
she can be okay if she just basically does what you did  - and she focuses on her core competencies such as being a good gamer and being a smart articulate person  then she can re-build her brand over time.
couldn t happen to a nicer person  if its really happened.
nope...she s been fired lol. saw the updated videos later the same day
his tweets are amazing lol!
james! your alive!
@radical reggie  Ive always been here  you just gotta look  and say hI every now and then!
frosk is in no way a good gamer
unless she apologises and shows genuine contrition  I really dont think frosk has much of a future in gaming. and I dont think she would apologise  because she seems prideful and she still doesnt seem to see anything wrong with her prior behaviour.she might try to transition into some sort of anti-sexism activist  but I think even then she d just be too obviously radioactive for companies to approach her. she should probably seek employment elsewhere.
she probably needs to learn to code.
wishful thinking at best.
kinnel just had an update on this like an hour ago and apparently its official now  from g4 themselves
she lacks 4 things  the goods  dental hygiene  personality   class
not here to rejoice  here to witness perfect karma in action
ah! there you are! I was just thinking yesterday that I hadn t seen you in my feed lately. I never watched g4  but Ive seen a lot of people complaining about this woman s meltdown over gamers. Im a gamer and I know you are too and Ive never felt the community to be sexist. gamers are a different breed of people and gaming is what we have in common. Im afraid this woman let her personal demons control her life to the exclusion to all else - including her job performance. there s just some places you dont go when youre on the clock. jmho
frosk just posted a tweet. looks like she is officially fired.
honestly I saw this whole coming from a mile away. g4 doesnt really have a place in the modern era. youtube and twitch has already filled up that niche. times are different now for better or worse and the same g4 wasn t cut any more. especially not no watered down version of it. sure I have nostalgia for g4 but it probably would have better off when it ended when it did.
we did it! we saved g4! flaming wreckage in the background
I honestly think its just a product of not having the good friend that will tell you when to stfu.
its about time!I cant tell you how many comments I left on g4 telling them to save the channel and fire frosk.
will frosk file a lawsuit frosk  g4tv discrimated against me!
well I didn t watch g4 in the first place and Im still not going to watch g4 now thatshe s gone... I d bet most of the people laughing at her and  celebrating  are the same as me on thatso its a little funny to see the reactions.on the other hand  she completely set herself up for this all on her own so I cant really blame people for pointing and laughing now that things have exploded in her face.
I wonder if frosk made that profile change just to get people on youtube talking about her. we probably wont know for sure until she doesnt show up in anymore videos on twitch youtube.
wait a minute. melonie doesnt have those lip injections.  she looks so beautiful again
personally  I do not think frosk has actually been fired. she would be having a meltdown on twitter about it  if she was.and as for the company...the only chance  and massive emphasis on  chance   g4tv has to recover from this whole situation is to completely clean house and let everyone go  including especially frosk and adam sessler   then hire entirely new people  and rebrand themselves as something along the lines of  no politics  just games . even if they did that  its still a long shot  but its probably the best chance they would have.
frosk got fired  kinda sounds like a sequel to freddy got fingered.
frosk sounds like a supervillain name but all we got was a junkie.
melonie is a saint. Im awash in shadenfraude.
I dont like to rejoice in peoples suffering laughs in crucifixion
if you dont like it  dont watch it  peace!  - and thats exactly what we did
tf were they thinking hiring her in the first place  she may be responsible for singlehandedly crashing g4 lol. these g4 directors were given a lot of money to start this thing and they just piss it all away. what s wrong with these people.
haha yeah  got my lip injections dissolved 3 years ago. never getting filler again - stupid mistake
@melonie mac go boom  the world will thank you for it. your a naturally beautiful woman melonie
at least we got chrissie mayr s frosk impression. that was one good thing that came out of this awful mess  lol.
frosk got frosty and g4tv gave her the fire.
I really enjoy your content and point of view
I follow you on twitch  so this is youre youtube! good stuff.
I left you a like because you said  blue hairs I laughed pretty hard
so it turned out to be a good day after all  d awesome.
finally some good news as g4 is still burning!
Im not sure that the stuff she claimed was said in chat was ever verified
its crazy how you cantell which side of this a girl is on solely based on if she s pretty or not.
we see this from selfish people that think of themselves thats why they say disrespectful thing on twitter right after a lot of her coworkers were laid off
seriously. she s like a crazy ex-girlfriend that just wont go away...
the one thing I like about frosk is thatshe decided to match her looks to her personality- grotesque.
cant stop laughing at az  heelvsbabyface  in a wig on frosk s tweet...
less than a year later  eh  its a shame g4 had to be this way.
itsaddens me that a show xplay fall so hard cause of her. and man..... just sad
frosk did its job. a decisive he she to give the once beautiful and magical g4 the edge it really really didn t need. de-serves them right.  g4tv3
this is what happens when you rant against imaginary villains
you are a better person then me  great video.
insulting the fan base always wins them over.
frosk  I survivedg4  did u tho
thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  you are very welcome!!
zipper survived
we just going to gloss over az as zipper  love that dude!
I d watch if you were on g4 xplay. that would be cool
what s so funny is frosk video will stay online forever so good luck in trying to find another job like she had.
g4 just blew up like the hindenburg. oh  the humanity!
hey melonie hope you are doing well with yourself   hope you had a great day today. anyway I just want to say that I am so truly happy that frosk got fired from g4tv. anyway frosk is problem person and she needs to be stoped before she destroy anyone who is famous or any company that is famous too  ok melonie. anyway frosk is like a problem child that keep making problems for anyone else who is trying to stay out of trouble. anyway that is what I want to say bout this video and I just want to say that frosk is highly problem person and she needs to be stopped  ok melonie. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie. God bless you melonie.
probably would ve saved g4 a lot of money  headaches  and maybe the network as a whole if they had bought out her contract a month after she made her fan-baiting rant and it tanked the viewership. instead  they hucked a gallon of gasoline at the trashfire.
I bet melanie mac and frosk r low-key best friends
honestly surprised it took this long.
youre cool  melonie.
that lady single handedly killed any interest I had the relaunch of g4
when frosk was hired....did someone tell her she was there to be easy on the eyes  maybe someone lied to her as a gag and she took itseriously because some simps probably inflated her ego
whatever g4tv needs to do to save its only potential money maker  aots   it needs to do. xplay is nostalgic but is not doing anything that 1000 other content creators are not already doing.
she tweeted her firing a little bit ago
melonie should be on g4.. then it ll be worth watching again
the best news melonie!! frosk did it to herself if she really is fired because of her own ego and big mouth.
after that meme and all the rage it induced  I wouldn t be surprised if she s trolling. she might link to g4 again the next day just to burn the rejoicing people if her posting that meme is anything to go off of. if she did get fired though  then good riddance  though it was a tad too late lol.
g4 is done by all accounts...frosk finished it off.
now thatshe s gone we should all go watch g4 now lol
quoting an amazing quote from george of the jungle  now comes the part where we throw our heads back in laugher...                  ready ready!!                     ready!!
your hair looks beautifull today in this video melonie!
if you travel to the east coast  I d like to buy you some drinks and just talk about how boys are vilified
this woman is a damn Goddess  smart and beautiful...
its scary that g4tv hired her in the first place  and also let her do that rant. and the fact that they did not put her on leave after the rant.g4tv is probably too leftist  aka the phrase  once you go woke  you go broke.
they bought out the rest of her contract and let her go.
I survived  was crass and tactless  and after the earlier saga  really badly damaging to an already sinking brand. this was far worse than the infamous rant  which had been read through and approved before it was ever broadcast  so clearly she was only voicing the opinion the company wanted to project. she took the flak but was clearly voicing something she and others on the team all believed as we can see from the following drama. not only should she be poison for someone to hire  the rest of the team should be treated exactly the same way.
melonie mac good content thoughts on constantine 2 love the first movie and I know its different from the comic comics which I love
if you lose your employer a ton of money and basically tank the entire company  then yes  you should be fired. you can make an argument thatshe single-handedly shipwrecked g4 all by herself.
g4 will be back or let go of the whole project now
ever since that rant I was like   what s this got to do with video games  I thought this was g4! .
wow. your compassion is epic
I guess we will have to see if this is really true or just one of those situations where they disappear for a short time and then come back more salty than ever. if they did fire her its too little too late. I would have fired her right after her big cry baby rant. at that point she became a liability and you dont want a liability working for you.
I dont think frosk realizes how much she damaged g4 s brand with that rant. unfortunately  I think this is too little too late  the damage has already been done and the only thing left to do is to take g4 back behind the barn and ole yeller it.
I love when the universe humbles a hideous person
so yeah she got fired and no  she doesnt have as many friends in the league community as you think. she was quietly fired from every riot job she had. she burned all her bridges there.
liked the hulk pic  great channel mac
man they fired dollar general mgk  good to hear!
hImelonie thanks for always sharing your thoughts on very interesting topics from you.melonie what do u think about the new reboot of hellraiser having awoman being pinhead takecare melonie
I guess frosk didn t survive...
you sound great. nice mic
consequences have actions-richard samuel jordan
lol     az immediately straight up in thatshit.. a true frontline warrior  beautiful   brave.
very level headed take  nj
so she is now the owner of g4
only way g4 can recover is if they hire andrew tate
you hate to see it  but more importantly . you love to see it.
my first encounter with frosk was when g4 posted that video of the rant  so that was a bad mark against her right away. I am for all people being treated the same  but some of this stuff just divides us more then unite us.  I was like wtf this girl is attacking people like this  I dont wanna listen to her. tell me gaming news. I use entertainment to get away from from politics and social agendas  just to have it follow me.
would ve been a whole lot different of a network reboot if mm was there in the place of frosk.
I think I will believe it when she makes a tantrum and a metoo xd
my favorite quote for entitled people when jerry falwell died  Christopher hitchens said   he was so full of shit  if you give him an enema  you could bury him in a shoebox!
but she was so stunning and brave...
replace them all with melonie mac and the friday night tights guys doing commentary and new  and razorfist doing game playthroughs.
there s something to learn here. make sure you hire someone who knows how to play their shooters rather than how to shoot their mouths.
Ive heard it being called fan baiting.
frosk didn t help anything   but I dont think it was the death blow everyone thinks it is. g4tv was always going to an uphill battle. with all the gamers on youtube  twitch  and everything online that type of show was just outdated.
boom!!!  down goes frosk!!
I will not cheer her demise  but I will cheer that we are one more step closer to our hobbies being free of politics. but for every step forward we do have one back. did you hear of the gentleman who worked for ign and gave the last of us 2 a 10 10  well he is now working for naughty dog. an excellent example of the incestuous relationship between devs and jurnos.
she let a couple of comments get to her. crazy. when I first found out g4 and x-play returned I was so excited. then this whole scandal happened and adam sessler going on a hatred rant on twitter completely turned me off. sucks g4 and x-play came to this end.
so they re  allegedly  quietly doing the thing they should have done within 24hrs. of the abysmal rant  okay  but too little  too late. they should have known that people who are  nice on the eyes for  viewers    while also being entertaining and good at their job  equals content people want to see. people talking at them about how  toxic  they are while  allies  clap like trained seals equals viewers leaving in droves. this has been the case for a long time now  yet some folks still haven t gotten the memo.
she s said goodby to g4 on her twitter. she gone.
g4 has actually been around for years. used to be a tv network  then moved to twitch and has tried to relaunch the tv network https   en.wikipedia.org wikI g4_ american_tv_network  original
thats like putting the fire out after more than half the house is burned down.
yup  I used to watch the old g4 back when it was tech tv
hell yeah I choose this cute youtuber anyday over frosk.
she just doesnt seem to understand that people dont like her for who she is as a person and couldn t care less if she is a woman.
Ive never heard of gamestop t.v  that might of been their problem to begin with.  people never hearing of it
in the words of the greatest president ever   youre fired.
I am sure she is not friends with many people seeing how she was sacked from her previous job
the mistake g4 made is trying to do what espn did with sports.   turning it into a soap opera drama instead of focusing on sports gaming
I was inclined to agree with you until I saw the vitriol for her first hand. when a video was posted  yesterday  by g4 thatshe wasn t present in  for a series thatshe has never been apart of  was inundated with hateful comments about her. I d estimate 90  of the comments for the video were about her and it just blew my mind because the people in the video weren t even apart of the show had the infamous meltdown. they just work at g4. that level of obsession cant possibly be healthy and really reframed the situation for me.
is it just me or does frosk look almost like those blue-checkmark twitter people
lmfaoo frosk should be a warning to the gaming industry in general well not just the gaming industry geekdom in general. do not in any circumstance disrespect the fandom or you will pay financially
I just came across this channel. I dont know if anyone would get the reference but does anyone know if melonie mac is from those adverts at gamestop
the consequences of her actions just goes to show how someone s emotions are so fragile that they are willing to tarnish the name of a company that they represent. a company thatshe works at  not own s but works at. not to mention I thought companies hire employees to do a job and they get paid for their ability to perform and do that job under stress  pressure and not because of their political views. Imean if those mean comments really got under her skin that much she should have just went to hr  ya kno  jus sayin. but no frosk you saw an opportunity for gotcha moment because you were in your feelings and decided to go on an epic rant just to get back at a few people   a small minority not the majority  that called you unattractive and look what it has cost you or even more importantly what it has cost the gaming community. you literally put yourself and your personal feelings before others. narcissistic much  but you are there to do a eff n job  not push political views. so unless she was in the wrong job field  politics does not pay your bills unless youre running. also to those other guys that were cheering her on   get em frosk!!!  or     during her rant  be careful and stay safe   okay . I bet your butt just clenched...
one does not simply launch one s self at the audience like a flying-bitch-missile and expect no reprocussions.
tell  em frosk.
I think it far more likely than g4 is going under and less likely that frosk was fired out right. I think she was fired but g4 is a sinking ship and everyone at g4 knows it.
well  since  frosk  did have a  bangable  face....... Im not gonna finish thatsentence
I remember when she caused a ruckus and threw her lec  league of legends european championship  colleagues  under the bus  when she quit and said that the workplace isn t diverse enough. like... wtf  they have had 1 guy from wales  1 guy from south african republic  an englishman  guy from us  fucking sjokz  goat female esports personality   female french interviewer.... I could go on. I dont get it how people from the us throw everyone who s white european into the same basket while we are so different from one another it cant be overstated. literally just compare anyone from the north to any person from the mediterranean sea.
whether it is true or not  I honestly dont care as bringing back g4 was pretty much an outdated concept by now. if it was done about 10 years ago sure  but during 2020s where individuals can do just as much if not more on their own than a corporate staff.as a certain assassin droid said   doing more with less  it is art.
I would call her a reactionist  not a activist.
frosk told me not to watch g4 so I stopped watching g4. simple.
I guess frosk talked to em  a bit too hard.
surprised it took them so long. that rant was one of the whiniest things Ive seen in awhile and its generally a bad idea to attack your viewers unless you just dont want viewers.
youre a lot more attractive than frosk bet that makes her mad too lol
me talking to g4 investors....  she cookin  y all
they cant fire frosk bc g4 will have to deal with the alphabet crew. g4 dont want thatsmoke. I call shenanigans.
say that fast 4 times!  g4-fired frosk
too little too late. yes  frosk finally got some accountability after what she did  but at the cost of an entire company due to terrible management wanting to back her and doubling down on her anti-men gamer rant thatshould have stayed dead with the remnants of gg. everyone who lost their job because of her and sessler should be livid at them  but I wouldn t be surprised if gamers and men will still be blamed by some.
the fact that one of her points was that the previous female cast  did not exist to be nice on the eyes for you   to be frank  is a little bit naive. if she actually paid attention to the original show  she d realize that literally every single female host was attractive  one modeled nude  another had an episode with a  gratuitous montage  about a host s butt in a bathing suit  etc. there was 100  a sexual element there  and to deny that is disingenuous. g4 had to know that they were going to get some backlash by burying that part of the show  considering long-time viewers likely expected it to some degree.the right response would have been to highlight that their values have changed and that they want to focus on other things. it absolutely should not have been to indiscriminately attack their base. hell  even calling out some of the most offensive comments would have been fine if it were targeted  but she came at the whole community. what did they expect would happen
they did not fire her. this is a cya move.
her rant was sexist simply for the fact that in thatsame rant  she admitted that her male co-host all had to face similar things as her  but only when it happened to her did it become sexist. add that to the celebrating of her co-workers being fired because of her  she is one of the worse human being in entertainment nowadays. not the worse  but one of the worse.
so your saying...she celebrated a bit too early
respectfully  we should all applaud when justice is served.
this would be a wonderful birthday gift  yes today is my birthday as I write this  to see frosk removed from g4. she deserves it and I dont feel bad.
that cheeky bastard v signed me
iron rule of woke projection strikes again. the people who claim everyone else is toxic are usually the most toxic people. contrast with melonie mac  who is the opposite of toxic  wholesome .
its funny because I think if she just shut up she wouldn t have gotten the boot. even though he isn t really on stable ground anyway.
the funny thing to me about that frosk rant was the black dude that was doing all the  tell em frosk!  and shit in the background  the dude is a horribly sexist piece of shit lol so frosk went on her toxic male gamer rant while sitting right next to probably one of the more toxic of them. Imean you can find numerous clips of that guy  if they haven t all been striken down by now  of him talking about women are only good for certain things  how he always makes sure they swallow  etc.  etc.. the ironic hypocrisy tickles me pink whenever I think about it lol.
while her rant was damaging and beyond hypocritical  it wasn t the only thing that has g4 in their current situation. there s just so many independent channels with better content like this one. g4 just tried profiting from nostalgia with minimal effort on innovation and creativity while injecting their own flawed beliefs. recipe for failure
I call it  she got shit-canned
g4 was gonna die regardless. frosty urine was just a catalyst that expedited the process. the number of employees they had to the income the entity as a whole was producing  cold piss was not solely responsible.  the meltdown just drove a ton of people off in a hurry as opposed to them falling off over time. g4 was nowhere near sustainable. a bunch of people are now unemployed. they would have been unemployed eventually anyways with the direction the company was going. youtube channels with solo creators need how many subs most of the time  with a 50  view rate  and 10  interaction rate to profit  mel  youre  in full timer territory at this point  you know this kinda stuff. g4 as a company  didn t stand a chance before the frosty urine rant. g4 has a whole studio  and multiple employees that make a living  need benefits and only generate 1  view rate with half a million subs and dropping. g4 was hemorrhaging money since the reboot. it was never even close to being in the black.
took too long if its true. they may have told her to take it off her twatter profile to ease the heat they were taking for her comments.
happy birthday!
@melonie mac go boom  thanks a bunch!!!!
dude I loved watching g4 growing up as a kid. I was stoked to hear it was coming back but her rant totally turned me off.
you earned my sub today for not celebrating this  melonie. a very grown-up position.
well  its been a good run  but farewell justin beiber. good luck with those hormone therapy treatments  we re all rooting for ya.as for the rest of us  let s play some games  yo!
frosk isn t exactly hard on the eyes either... but maybe people seeing her as a downgrade doesnt have anything to do with her looks.... but the fact she s not trying to be fun  she s not trying to connect with fans... she s using g4 as a platform to spew her political views  uninformed takes on gaming and then attack anyone who dares disagree... while lumping everyone into the  sexist gamer  basket.
ol  snaggletooth finally got some comeuppance.  too little  too late.  get woke  go broke
I dont care about frosk. its more a tragedy that g4 had to go down for this. maybe this will create a vacuum though for other indie shows..
imagine the ego it takes to brag about not being fired while simultaneously being one of the main reasons g4 failed causing many people to get fired that had nothing to do with the rant.  I dont know much at all about this frosk person  but what a tone def comment.  its her own fault if she finally paid the price for her actions  people online are always going to be toxic - gotta have thick skin or stay out of the comments!
now frosk can go back to the shire.
you want the reality    you arent going to like it   the reality is from host ppl have only a few directions to go  in a healthy setting - movies tv shows guest starng evebts and new host or co host to other shows. from a hurt career for both men and women   host or co host to a different show guest staring interviews forum change  from situations like frosk . really the general outlook on her is negetive she has proven to be an active threat to who she works for so hireing her itself is a risk she could try an adult career but nobody wants to see her in that capacity so thats out .... I really dont see any good direction this could go . feminism is antI career thats just fact
she really cemented her reputation in a bad way with that  I survived  tweet. so insensitive.
this is what people have a hard time understanding about Christians.  we separate the sin from the sinner.
I normally dont revel in people getting fired but she isn t exactly a good person from what we ve seen. her character seems rotten to her core. I think her commentary on lol for europe was ok but when it came to the panels she always came across as egotistical. I could sorta understand the choice to pick her as a g4tv host  sorta. however when it came to her original rant attacking gamers  thatshould have been her end to the network. I wish I could leave a .gif here because it would simply be jeremy clarkson saying  oh no  anyway. I ll go about my day like any other lolIm glad youre enjoying yourself doing this! itshows in your videos!! keep it up!
smart move g4tv
look. I really dont like  cancelling  people for their opinions. however this women was a big factor in the downfall of this revival. she took no accountability to the fact thatshe was a factor in why those people lost their job.
get woke  go broke
g4 has no chance to even survive another year
I have no idea what g4tv is  never watch it. no idea who this person is.  but I canthrow my 2 cents of experience in and say there is no small portion of gamers that are kinda sexist  ....depending on what game you are playing.  overall that group seems to be centered around fps games  I have no idea why.  but as you move in to the more cooperative games like mmo s there you find more inclusive groups.  where that behavior is considered unacceptable.
comcast bought out the rest of her contract.  she s gone
a little behind on the news but is so nice to see a non-sjw girl
I hope zipper got to keep her job.
yeah I think the biggest reason she gets negative comments about her appearance is that her harsh and rude personality  on camera at least  is unattractive. when she was hosting for league esports she looked good to me
@melonie mac go boom  oh I can admit  there s a lowest common denominator for guys  and some guys will say  ugly  senseless crap... but sexism  ha! she thinks thats bad  turn a bad kd in a call of duty lobby! xd trust me  guys can get it just as bad online... if your skin is that thin  perhaps knitting is a better choice of occupation.
she was good on lpl cast  since then she went batshit  idk what the fuck happened bc she was pretty good  but yeah
g4 is already dead and buried
Im not buying it. g4 protected this child at the cost of everything. would be right to be rid of someone who single handedly destroyed a company and the lives of the employees there.
hire thinkers with skills  passion  drive  ability  honor  dignity  loyalty  compassion  courage  commitment  character  charisma  potential  artistic experience  intelligence  artistic talent   the goods  personality  style  attitude  class   intensity  not activists
yes and her complaining will be music to my ears.not apologizing.
when it comes to insanity  its hard to spot. a person is flying a kite in a park among a whole crowd of kite flyers. another is angrily marching up to the flyers. which person is insane let me give more. the kite flyer just bought their kite today  and its of poor make. the angry person lives on the top floor of an apartment complex nearby and its their day off. which person is insane more info. the kite person has been openly stating that they hate kites and people who fly kites. the angry one loves the view of the trees from their deck  and this is their one day off this week.one may be more aggressive  heck. maybe even violent   but  as long as their motivations and stressors can be understandable  its not insanity. its just anger. they may not be handling the situation well  but its still follows a logical cause and effect. the more passive one  though  is actively participating in a pass time that they hate  and  possibly deliberately  doing it in a way to make themself or others more miserable. there is no possible logic there other than juvenile spite. thats insane. actively putting yourself in situation you loath for no better reason than negativity.
she jinxed herself
I love that you are unwilling to indulge in schadenfreude   frankly  there s too much of that on the right and the left these days. having said that  itseems pretty clear to me that frosk invited this. more than that  her rant likely sank the entire company. society needs to stop indulging her brand of self-righteous anger. perhaps the pendulum is swinging in the other direction  and we can get less of this nonsense in the future. in the meantime  I ll remain subscribed tot his channel.
as long as sessler is still there  its going to be garbo.
pretty good chance she s trolling as well to piss off people and her ex coworkers again also. I dont think she can have any other form of pleasure. other s misery is what does it for her.
I wish you still did the Bible verses. I know it might not have been popular. but. I did appreciate them. keep going though. youre awesome.
I just chock it up to youreap what you sow.  I just feel sorry for the the behind the scenes people.
you get more views on your videos than g4 and your operating costs are probably 1 10 000th of g4 s. they dont get it. there s no need for a massive infrastructure to talk about gaming. great  entertaining youtubers do it for almost nothing.
the sad part is thatshe was actually not wrong. its the way she came about it that really fucked her up.
I had no idea who or what a  frosk  until I clicked on some video yt served up. I knew what g4   tech tv was but thatshould have been left in the 2000 s
tell em frosk! tell em how you were fired! even if g4 fired her or moved her to a less visible role  doesnt matter. the damage is done to the brand. also  frosk wasn t even the systemic problem  many personalities there are untalented and woke   she only embodied what was wrong. I hope sessler is next.
I cant stop staring at frosk s teeth !! why are they different colors
man g4 used to be so good  sad its just made of shit lmao
I use to enjoy g4 as a child  but knowing the online mainstream media of today  it was already doomed. then frosk was brought in  along with the overall direction of the revived g4  it was doomed from the start. all they had to do was bring in people that enjoy the genre  instead of ruining the party for everyone.
I ll tell you somebody else who should roast frosk anna thatstar wars girl she will roast her like a straight-up rotisserie chicken lol
lets keep it real  there are plenty of both male and female sexist veiwers out there. we have a culture of body sexual imagery that dictates most everything we experience and work toward.thatsaid   just as many people out there only focus on their inner beauty  working to project it outward. but what they have in common  neither one is trying to change the perception of the other group...and also  everyone seeks a fantasy they have power over  just for themself.frosk s mistake is projecting her ideals unto others knowing it wont work. she wants approval thatshe didn t find  time to de-value it by changing her audience s identity. problem  she attacked a gender  not the audience with that mindset  and since you cant change your gender  us guys had to defend it. sorry it went on long  just wanted to drop some knowledge. good luck in getting help  frosk
you should be in g4
this
she sure survived huh....
darn. so... what s for dinner everyone
I just came here to throw you another like  because sexism in gaming reeeeeeee!!!
frosk is to g4 as union carbide is to bhopal  india.... or was.
tell em frosk!
be careful who cares about games  when the clout is more important than the product.
probably quit on her own though I know people just want to believe she was fired
just like they fired harambe...but different.
they were never going to make a comeback imo. she just fast tracked the inevitable. had they tried what originally worked for them back in the early 2000s they may have survived.
its about time.
great news. wtf is frost
thats okay. I ll celebrate it.
looks like I survived!
I guess frosk saw how successful anita sarkisian was with her bullshit and said  let me try that! .
I rejoice when people that hate me fail.
you shall reap what you sow!
you dont bite the hand that feeds you.
she ll keep popping up like gross 80 s horror icon.
strong unemployed woman!
I guess she didn t survive  haha.
even got the pronouns in the bio.
she fire she just posted thanking the g4 company and she will miss working for them this was do to the I survive post
go get your job melonie
about time!
goo get em frooosk
my thing is that they need to keep their activism out of gaming. gaming is escapism  we game to get a break from insane people like this so Im glad she s gone.
come on mel ! go boom !
not just fired.  canceled.  I dont see her in any of their thumbnails.
definitely that I survived tweet.
melonie mac is my idol
alarently the higher ups didn t replace her cuz they say the channel was going to die and they wanted her to be associated with that instead of ppl blaming comcast or whatever.
its about time..
everybody cant  survive  the royal rumble.
I survived sike!
she did survive  right
awww Im so sad.
attitude like frosk make a person ugly. I grew up by not biting the hand that feeds you. now people comp down on that hand and feed until its gone and they have no food left.
frosky got fingered
assuming frosk has indeed been kicked to the curb... too late  g4tv! they should never have hired that nasty piece of work in the first place. supporting her vile rant against the viewers killed any chance they had to survive.
cometing for the agorithmn.

who would have thought yelling at your customers would cost you money.......strange
glad adam sessler got the boot  too. he asked for it after the slander he s thrown.
mel  41 days til  halloween
she brought it on herself. hate to say it  but she did.
and even if she got fired she still got payed her full salary so she kinda wins.I dnt even care for her but to see a million videos made about 1 person is nutz
youreap what you sow.
cue killing joke joker laughkarma strikes once again!
and now time for my favorite newfangled word  yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!
I refused to watch g4 after that rant  silver lining though was I got introduced to chrissie  nerdrotic and all you guys because of it
yay  what about adam sessler
not even the wife liked her rant..!!!
mm to replace frosk.
froskurinn is out!
sorry g4  its simply too late.
getwokegobroke
if they hired machine gun kelly no one would notice her leaving.
I know Im super cringe  but Jesus you are h... y know what Im gonna be less cringe. you look very nice.
g4 fired frosk
well she should have gotten fired after  the whole gloating shit.!!!!
hell yeah the girl with the gelfling face and elf ears is gone bye-bye frosk
then wait till u have the  details .
finally.
lean too much to the left and you end up at the outskirts of the right  ..
dont give me hope
example  2397323 of get woke  go broke
what a great day
ding  dong  the clown is gone!
its that dopamine high
I thought they already had  didn t the following week they put amouranth in a bikinI on their show to try to get ratings back
did you get the call for the job
frisk is gone   oh no
literally anyone in this comment section would do a better job than her
she is gone now and confirmed... we need a new queen to take her place lol...
mel go boom
her name is devon. say her name
can we fire g4tv
funny how karma works isn t it
watching this  bangable  channel
I get her rant...but that was not the right time to do it...on that note  Imiss olivia munn as a host
Im not woke enough for them
finally they did the right thing
good!!
bring back candace bailey or sarah jean underwood.
its my first time watching on this channel. I didn t come here looking for a host that looks bangable. I watch asmongold on a regular basis and Im not gay which means I dont watch his videos because I find him bangable. good God  I just want to watch good content. now  Im definitely steering off any content that has frosk on it.
she had her entire contract bought out  meaning thatshe got paid for the entire rest of her contract in a lump sum without having to work at all.that is not a loss. she is not suffering.screw her.
g4tv dies as gaming lives on!!!game on people!
no more verse of the day
replace her with melonie mac and I ll watch ye. absolutely lol.
@melonie mac go boom
g4 tv is dead because people got tablets and phones now everything is on the internet
frosk is likely gone thats good possible news.  az meme
I thought she was gone a long time ago.either way  I still hope for a proper revival of some kind without woke shit.
the president of g4tv  at the time  didn t help matters with her rant.
ruie n1dont insuit your patrons if you want to keep your job
ding dong! the witch is dead!
too little too late though  no amount of damage control is gonna bring people back.
hate to wish this on anyone but...karma for a terrible person
oop got em...!
hImelonie mac what s your favorite ps4 exclusive mine is uncharted 4 and lost legacy bloodborne spider-man and ratchet and clank
frosk thought thatshe was special and untouchable just because she s a woman
after months of doing the left thing.
replacefroskwithmeloniemac
I dont personally know  frosk  but she sure seems like a bad person  one I d not like to work for me. way more harm than good for a company. let her go  let it go.
she will be okay...frisky does not need people to watch or support her...she is rich...
its too late now !
she deserves to be fired and Im glad she s gone because she was so rude and disrespectful to her co-workers  trying to shame the audience and make them feel bad for liking olivia munn  morgan webb and gina darling! its so disgusting!
nice tats.
yeahhhh its kinda too late.... lol
boom
replace her with you and g4 s ratings will skyrocket.
seems don lemony to me.
az
get woke go broke
full circle
ding dong the witch is dead!
shes been doing this kinda shit for years now  completely unhinged
ive never even heard of g4 nor this frosk chick until now with all these news. now im in a rabbit hole binge
good
hal  ah  you  yah.
unfortunately I doubt she will learn anything from this  she has a victims mentality. g4 and adam sessler need to just go away as well.
couldn t happen to a nicer  person
disney will love her... I bet you anything that they grab her.  lmao !!!
oof!
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha breath hahahahahahahahahahahaha!
xd
replace fr0sk with mel0nie mac but minus the tattoos.
wait   a non woke female with tattoos talking about  pop culture   glad it appeared on my feed . subscribing .
its a fake firing
its a fake firing just for show  plus g4 showed their true colors by enabling her
oh no.......
lol
its a good move  but it might be too late. she s just not a good fit for a game show talking head. too easily triggered and unable to contain herself.
not a good look on a resume having tanked the relaunch of a famous gaming channel
frost is gone bye bye she wont be missed.
hahahhahahahahaha
marketing scheme. frosk is still employed higher ups want to disassociate from her. down with the company.
no scripture of the day
boom
I love watching these people fail
isn t this the angsty  annoying harpy who started her first day by attacking the audience  color me shocked her career was a short one. also  pronouns in twitter bio lmao
professional behavior needs to become a standard again. have a personal private account and a professional account.if I own a company and my employees act like how people now adays while saying in their social media the work for me  therefor represent me  I would fire them. your crappy behavior and ego will in no way shape or form effect my wallet.... but ill let it effect yours.by no longer paying you.
frosk  lolsounds like a brand of soggy cereal... I hope she doesnt try to pull an  anita sarkeesian  and manages to live of donations and idiots.
when a dog bite the hand that feeds it  it needs to be put down.
the name  frosk  sounds like something involving bacteria  a sticky residue  and a lack of feminine hygiene.
I usually hate to take  pleasure  over someone else s misery...however  frosk  is a horrid person and needs to be out of the gaming journalism space.  she d be happier being a activist or some other useless occupation.
I dont mean to simp  but damn you are really pretty.
hopefully  her work visa will expire and she can be deported back to canada.
she wont have very many opportunities. for one she s an abrasive person and she s not attractive especially her style is off putting. people pretend attractiveness doesnt matter on youtube or gaming channels but it does  and g4 used to know that. every female youtube gaming channel Ive seen is a good looking person.
canthey fire you also    ugh
pure narcissism at work  she was terrible.
why dont you work there
never heard of them or her either.just more irrelevant people doing irrelevant things.
honestly the rule any company should follow is dont hire social justice activists. if pronouns are in the bio do not hire
they should ve fired frosk  adam and the rest of her lackeys on a public scale and that would ve been the only way to salvage this dying channel.
wow shit on men in gaming and you get sacked  mmm 90  of gamers are men.that   power. about damn time!
just completely selfish.
hhaha
no she s not.
good now stop talking about it  its time to move on to bigger and better things!
good I h8 that brawd
I dont work for anyone any more so I d say no lol
@melonie mac go boom   lol kino response    I was just trollin ya   gg
Im not woke enough to work there
another anita sarkesian  force arguing that problem in gaming sexism. the problem in gaming is freaking loot boxes   micro transactions
she s not fired  they established to  hide her in the back    so she d be no longer target of the h8 tweets !!! ....
melanie does have a piercing voice like fran drescher.but also beautiful like fran
good. now go back to the source material formula you had before and dont betray it again g4.
you dont have anything if she fired  so it clickbait.
I personally find what sessler said more off-putting than frosk  and Im not even a republican.
wait frost is a woman
protecting yourself with a question mark to gain views...and dragging out what could be a 3 minute video to over 10.
no one should go support g4 now. they re the problem in the first place by supporting this idiocy.
now get rid of sessler and maybe people will start to watch again
no  she did not get fired. she still works for them  they are just hiding her and hoping that people will forget her bs and they can start to make some money. after they get things turned around  they plan to bring her back to the spotlight.
glad she is gone. ding dong the witch is gone!!
g4 is dead channels like this and geeks   gamers will prevent it from ever coming back. frosk killed the brand...
are video gamers sexist  hell no
couldn t happen to a more miserable  vile  toxic 4th generation feminist.
protected  woke  leftist feminism is dying and should be left out of entertainment. games  movies  anything that brings joy. keep your thoughts on your own platform  not in the workspace or anything that provides entertainment.
to be honest I think she is promoting sexism. how  well sexiest men already think that women are dumb. yes or no  if yes then we have to look at her actions. did she prove them right  well yeah. she is fired her female co workers  are fired. will more companies bring her or people like her on  is this going to help women in the gaming industry   is that the actions of an intelligent human being  if the answer is no  then she reacted exactly the way sexiest men predicted. like an idiot. she is proving them right. sad because its so obvious to not go about it this way.
good riddance to garbage I say. especially woke garbage
why are you doing that fake voice
turns out it is official  so the speculation I covered here is true
@melonie mac go boom  it not you just said it maybe she got fired. you think everyone will be all over this by now
friggin why though
I didn t know my voice was fake lol
