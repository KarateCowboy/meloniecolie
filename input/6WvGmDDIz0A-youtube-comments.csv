still remember the interview he did with brie and him basically saying  if people are entertained then I did my job and am happy that I was able to do that dude kept to himself and Ive liked almost everything he was in. I truly hope he makes a full recovery.
I hope that jeremy renner ends up ok from this terrible accident and that he s able to get back up on his feet in no time. Ive been a massive fan of his for awhile now. this is some terrible news.
such a sad story. he s one of the few  seemingly  good guys in hollywood  and he s been great for the reno tahoe area. hope he pulls through this  but with the modern era of social media  the longer we go without an  update  from renner is unnerving. hoping for the best!
prayers for renner. I honestly know nearly nothing about him or his beliefs. doesnt matter. he s a human being.
glad that yourecovered from your dehydration. I hope jeremy renner recovers soon. I was shook last night when I saw the news on twitter. woke people are pricing that he s in critical condition and here I thought they couldn t stoop any lower morally speaking. as a catholic  Im praying for jeremy s recovery and I hope God will help him get through this
hope he is ok. Ive had accidents like this in the family that have taken people s lives. and its a rough situation for everyone.
trust me. if someone gets their legs ran over by a snow cat. their legs will be crushed and 95  of the time you will need amputation. God bless jeremy. and jeremy is one of the good guys on hollywood.  he lives a modest life. and a very genuine and down to earth kinda person.
operating heavy equipment is no joke.  I certainly hope he comes out okay and regains his health.
I grew up working with heavy tracked-vehicles including plows and cats  and Im a paramedic. leg injuries under one of those things... God s hand is shown in jeremy still being alive. massive traumatic blood loss makes me think it may be femur femoral artery damage  and that gets life-threatening in a hurry  especially with tracks that wide. praying for him. prayers for his family.
I hope he makes a full recovery this is sad news
first time I remember seeing him was 28 weeks later.  he wasn t famous  but I really liked his acting.  hope he recovers fully.
from what I understand he is in stable condition so he should be go to go for a full recovery. its an unfortunate accident that happened to him. prayers to the man and his family and Godspeed for a full and complete recovery
prayers for jeremy and you  thanks for making all these videos
prayer go out to jeremy renner. be well melonie
will definitely be praying for him. hopefully he makes a full recovery!
injuring a femoral artery is no joke  if thats what happened . you can bleed out really quickly. glad his neighbor is a doctor. I wish him the best.
he is a great actor. I wish him a fast recovery.
he s great in everything he s in. terrible news. will praying for his recovery.
youre the kindest and most respectful of the creators. thank you and a very happy new year  melonie.
youre absolutely right melanie there is a lot of power in prayer. praise God. I said a prayer for jeremy and his family and friends. God bless you and your family and friends too. duane.
I feel like he ll survive  but could definitely be losing a leg. Imean the fact that he was airlifted probably means his leg was basically mangled
@kyle william  latest report is that he s out of surgery and responsive. great news! man  I had a bad feeling about this one and  if the latest report is true  Im happy I was wrong!
amen! Ive been thinking and doing the same  all day. I hope he and his family know there are many of us out here praying for him.
same.disturbed by seeing woke ghouls cheerlead for his death on twatter.makes me like him a lot more now though.
my prayers are also with him and his family. I hope he s okay.
@lunger anon  I heard about that and am confused. as far as I know  he s fairly left wing  he did a few of those  social justice  videos with a bunch of other celebs . but  goodness  the guy is fighting for his life. he has a family. I dont care about his politics. he needs prayers.
@joshua bray its twitter people pray for someones death on there every day probably.hell maybe all of the internet has that issue reddit certainly
@zrx163455  jeremy has trump derangement system. other than that  he s a decent  dude. Imet him years ago  so Im speaking from personal experience.
@joshua bray  I wish we could think thatsame way about healthy people who are not fighting for their lives. they are  after all  human beings. despite their political beliefs.
amen. praying alongside you there.I do not understand why these people on twitter were praising this accident and hoping that he died. honestly  where does it even come from  renner hadn t been on their radar so  wh-why all of this hate  Imean  it might be pointless to ask where is the source of irrational hate  but  they often point at some sin they made of to justify this evilness.
as a new agers sending positive thoughts
@sarn  provide evidence of these hateful tweets because they are most likely awful trolls but not just ordinary people. it is not normal to hate on someone you dont even know but can at least empathize with his family after such a disaster
@spartan300  they re on twitter and the reason why renner was trending. I dont need to provide evidence that is as accessible to you as it is to me. and even if they are hateful trolls - and I am aware that this happens in the internet - I am a millenial. I grew up with the internet. these voices werent put to trend. if anything  they were mocked or in the least ignored. trash talk  this ain t no trash talk. this is just vile and not even trolling. its gone beyond that.I guess we cant underestimate the ability for people to irrational.
@aaron hill  100  agree. I keep thinking about that  actually. I have no idea  how my neighbors vote or where they go to church. but  we are all still friendly  go to cookouts  etc. and  when a hurricane hits  we are all helping each other.
@joshua bray  eh  peoples is peoples. I try to avoid the political stuff. then someone will gaslight me and try to get me to think that a person is not allowed to be apolitical. it happens. I hold true to my personal beliefs  friendship  loyalty  honesty  trust  reliability  care and a belief in the undying human spirit. thats the best I can do. the fact of the matter is that as long as you are a good person and stick to your beliefs  I dont really care what your political choices are. there s good and bad on both sides. just be the best person you can be and try to love as much as possible and youre ok in my book.
@joshua bray  when people do things like that on social media  cheerleading someone s demise or unfortunate incidents. its less about actual politics and more about them advertising their own mental issues they cant cope with so they need to vomit it out on social media for the world to see.
@aaron hill  lol I remember my friend used to troll me   pick a side!  I was no like no ahole I just want to enjoy life not wallow in misery lol
hes a trans muslim feminist woman
how
unless its a snow
yeah man. one of my good friends almost lost his foot from a big riding lawnmower this last summer. got all tore up  got lucky not to lose more than most of his toe
and one of my moms uncles lost a leg in an industrial accident decades ago
my best friend was always building and rebuilding engines. as early as elementary school he had a father and grandfather that was really talented and they passed it on to him. well  he was the lead mechanic for a very large tractor company here where I live and on a friday afternoon right as it was time to get off  he went and took a hammer and hit a piston on the engine they were working on and it released and went through his eye and out of the back of his head one of the worst parts is he was one of the best people you would ever want to meet and would give you the shirt off of his back back
as someone who operates heavy equipment   this story makes no sense.  its  damn near impossible  to flip a sno-cat. you would have to drive it off a cliff to do that and they only way he could have ran himself  of is if he did wear a seat belt and was thrown from the cab. I have a feeling  something  else  happened  like a parking brake failure.
@the truth a  I guess it could tip over trying to go up a steep incline but it is perplexing how he ended up underneath it.  weird things can happen so who knows.
@sub if you are against antifa and blm  why did he place his eye right over it
@sub if you are against antifa and blm  this is why ppe is important
God put him there in the first place lol
and we just lost ken block to one where it flipped ontop of him  fucking machines
first thing I saw him was swat. as a villain. he s a versatile guy
stable  does not equivocate to a full recovery  it just means he wont get worse.could still have lost the leg.
@jacob mcquaid  I hope he doesnt lose his leg
Im glad that it was just a leg injury and that he s making a smooth recovery and hopefully that there isn t any permanent effects of the injury.
thats wild I hope he makes a full recovery he s a great father   I know we cant control everything but it would have been so tragic we just lost jason david frank   kevin conroy in the same week towards the end of 2022. hope 2023 is good year for renner and his family hope he is okay
couldn t happen to one of the nicest men out there. praying for his recovery! Ive been a fan of jeremy way before marvel so thats nothing! props to him for operating his own snow plow. hope he s able to walk again soon!
dang  thats crazy! prayers for jeremy! sometimes people that lives in the mountains have to plow their way to the mail roads  simply because no one else can reach them.
amen there is power in prayer. may God continue to bless you melonie. I believe this is going to be a really good year for you. love ya melonie. take care.
damn  suffering such injury in the first day of the year  thatsucks.all the best wishes to him and his family!
if he got his leg caught in a snowcat tread  that could f ck you up pretty bad. thats the equivalent of a tank or a tractor falling on you.liked him since I first saw him in the town. praying he makes a full recovery.
damn  I actually really like renner  seems like a cool dude and a good dad  I hope he heals ok
prayers to renner and his family. get well soon bro!
Im still trying to comprehend how could this even happen ! how did the vehicle of thatsize  with tracks that wide flipped over ! he also had to fall out of the drivers seat  through the closed doors... this has to be the unluckiest set of events...    I hope he makes a full recovery with no permanent damage to his health.
oh heck...  I hope he s going to be okay.  I love him in the avengers properties and in other movies he s done  and he seems to actually respect the fans which I love.and if the femoral artery was badly damaged  he could have bled out in no time at all.  critical condition for sure!God bless and protect him.
I hope he makes a speedy recovery
love your channel keeping it real
big prayers for jeremy renner ive hope he recovers n gets better
jeremy is a guy who before being an actor was flipping houses .. so he is fairly handy and I could definitely see him doing something like this for his home.  sad to hear this happened to him.
I hope his doing well  his in my prayers sense the start of this.
he seems like the kind of guy who would want to work outside despite being easily able to pay others to do things.
sounds like there was possibly traumatic damage to the femoral artery. very low chance of survival if something happens to that. man  I definitely wish him and his family well.
getting run over even on your leg with with a tracked machine its likely going to be tearing flesh open   crushing that can definitely be fatal. not only that but chances of severe possibly fatal infection are also high. assuming they made the decision to try to save his leg he probably wont walk again for 12-18mos. prayers for his full recovery
that driveway of his is no joke its a long hilly path. my guess is the cat might have stalled or started to roll away and he stepped out after accidentally putting it in neutral and itslid on him when he was trying to get back in it. they said it flipped over but im having trouble believing that could happen but who knows.
you d be surprised how easily those things can flip in the right scenarios at the right angle. they re really heavy  so once they start going there s no stopping it
@budgie cat  I can see that happening  its quite common with cars  although I have no idea how vehicle with tracks behave when in neutral  but what is reported really sounds improbable. I guess we ll get to learn the facts once he recovers from the accident.
@nedim mehmedovic  yeah I said thatsame thing the track is so wide all the weight is on the bottom how could it possibly flip unless it rolled off a cliff. the theory that he got out of the machine to check something and it rolled on him makes more sense. unless he is driving that machine with his feet out the window youre right how could he go out the door!
some simple ways a snow cat cantip or flip. sometimes people drive one laterally up snow bank  when the plow isn t actively engaged   or a track can be driven into loose snow that gives way beneath  even when the plow is engaged . even a tracked vehicle needs to stay basically flat  for a cat that wide less than 45 degrees
@mdizzy  looking at this vid here https   www.youtube.com watch v abvzp6gf-qcwhile obviously not as big as renner s snow cat  this guy s snow cat threw the track when he was making a sharp turn. so maybe that could be another reason culprit.  maybe the track got disingaged and when he want to check the engine was still running and it was in neutal and slid on him. or maybe it track disingaged and flipped and he flew out but I imagine those doors should be secure for that not to happen. but machines can be faulty. or maybe the brakes just went out after he got out of it and he got hurt trying to get back in it.
@budgie cat  look at 7 45 of melonies video. look how much wider renner s machine is. I would believe the one in the video you linked could tip over but not renner s  the two vehicles are not the same.
@mdizzy  maybe not flip over but it could throw a track.and actuallly I was watching another snow cat video earlier  deep snow  and it was as big as jeremy s and at times you could see it leaning and tilting as it was going through the trails through snow deep enough to reach the top of the tracks
it didn t flip over
and if they re treating it as a crime scene  it makes me wonder if he got nudged run off the road by a reckless driver because its not easy to roll a cat.
@that patrick guy  the snowcat is way bigger and heavier vehicle
@blox117  yeah  I know  but all it takes is some asshat to bump or crowd it to make the driver have an automatic reflex to swerve away from contact and cause the cat  if too near a ditch or embankment  to roll.
@mr mistah  yeah from what I heard it got stuck and him and a nephew were towing it out  possibly with a winch truck  and he got out of it to speak to his nephew and they noticed itstarting to roll and I think he went after it trying to get back in it  and to do that  with these pistontbully snow cats  you have to stand on the tank like treads to get to the door to get it and perhaps he slipped and fell and it ran him over. now whether the brakes mechanically failed  its been known to happen I seen a youtube vid of one guys snow cats brake failed but that was a much smaller different model  or maybe through human error and  jeremy forgot to set the brake on who knows but that model is discontinued on the company s website so he probably bought it used.in any case he is conscious now and made a statement to his fans and is out of surgery but we still dont know the full extent of his injuries
now im hearing jeremy renner was trying to save someone stranded in an accident after the snow blizzard they had the night before.
@budgie cat  I just saw the update provided by jeremy s representatives  renner was run over by his snowcat after the machine started to roll away when he was not in the driver s seat. he was injured during an attempt to get back into the snowcat. itseems you were spot on.
praying for him and his family!
prayers up for jeremy renner
I hope and pray that he will be alright. regardless of his political or religious beliefs  I like him. he s awesome as hawkeye so he should aim to get well soon
prayers go out to him.
I hope he recovers safely.
thats a tough injury he s either going to limp or wheelchair so sorry for your buddy stay strong its a good thing the acting made you a good chunk to live
hope he ll be ok  and he doesnt lose any limbs.
you got a heart of gold  girl.
prayers going out to jeremy renner and his whole family. anyway I have seen him in his movies and he is a great actor and he does well with his movies too. anyway also I really like your videos melonie and you are doing a fantastic job with making this videos for us to make a great comment about your videos. anyway hope you had a great day today and hope you have a great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
thats rough I hope he s doing well! and yeah I agree. prayer is good. I love how you add biblical truths to your videos keep it up you make my days brighter.
all the best for mr. renner  hope that he ll pull through! he s awesome in hurt locker.
praying my guy pulls through. heard about this late  and read that he had sustained blunt chest trauma. agree about prayers  faith  and miracles. we dont get what we want  through God s plan we get what we need. miracles also thatsome look back at as  lucky  or  coincidence   but sometimes things need to play out to where looking back  everything had to play out exactly how it did for it to have worked out. also  I didn t plan on watching thatshow  however your play by play commentary was funny. if the show is too terrible  I dont blame you for not covering  but if your coverage was like the last one  I would like to see your take...
there s always so many incidents with those snow plows... people just need to stay out of those.  hope he s getting well
despite the current mcu  I hope he s okay.prayers for a full recovery.medically  yes a leg injury can be serious even fatal.  there are major arteries in the legs.   not just the femoral artery. shit this is sounding bad if his snowcat plow may have been sabotaged.
coincidentally  I was just re-watching the show angel and a young jeremy renner appeared in an episode. I was surprised to see he s 51  I always assumed he was in his early 40 s. I have no idea what the future holds for renner  but hopefully he recovers and can go back to doing what he loves.
praying for mr. renner and his family!
God was certainly watching out for jeremy. I pray he recovers fully
amen sister melonie  prayers for a quick recovery and God bless you as well.
been a minute glad to see you still killing it!
great update! way to stay on top of things! great channel!
I saw that movie that movie was badass
we lost a lot of talent last year. and to start off with 2023 with this situation  its like  man...the 2020s are just awful. praying he recovers soon.
hopefully he makes a full recovery. we already lost ken block to some sort of snowmobiling accident.
I d love my own snowcat. almost as cool as a unimog. hope jeremy makes a full recovery.
get well soon. I am very worried about the tracks on that thing. all I can say is please pray for him and his family. if it ran over his leg he really needs the Lord.
God  I hope he will be ok  he s been in so many movies that I like not just the marvel ones
we definitely need  story time with melonie mac
prayers up for damar hamlin and jeremy renner
I wish jeremy renner all the best and speedy recovery.  happy new year young lady.
hopefully he s able to recover back to 100 . btw  I dont know why I love  heckin  as word in general. it just makes me smile. if anyone said  hellin  we d look at them like they re crazy.  heckin  works for some reason.
melanie almost scared the s    out of me Im glad he s okay he needs to take a rest thats what jeremy needs to do he s already in the latest mission impossible part 1 and 2 last films stay healthy thats all I got to say
the femoral artery in the leg is one of the largest arteries in the body. he s very lucky. also earlier the media were saying snow-cat but showing stock pics of an atv. huge difference!
absolutely tragic news!  I really hope he makes a full recovery but the fact he had a full snowcat plough  over 6000kg  run over his leg  there s a very real chance he could lose the leg.  I hope Im wrong but its really not looking good .
I love that you pray for him.  we need to pray for everyone no matter what political views as a lot of people are blinded these days so the antI Christ can use them for his purpose sadly  but we still need to pray for everyone
let s send him some positive vibes.
prayers out to him
this is horrible news and a bad way to start the year.  thank goodness his neighbor was able to react quickly and they were able to airlift him on time.  I really hope jeremy renner pulls though  I know he will because he s an avenger.  thanks for covering this  melonie.
yikes! hope he will be okay. I liked him in the hawkeye series and he s a good actor.
if you haven t seen mayor of kingstown its incredible and renner s an absolute badass in it. new season dropping soon I think. one of the best shows Ive seen and I only heard of it through a random convo.
yo  I was actually there over the weekend as well  and it was really something. our power went out on saturday around like 8pm and just never came back  there was a build-up of like almost 4 feet of snow where there previously was none on the ground. the insulation was really good so we didn t freeze to death or anything  but out the windows for the entirety of saturday was just full-on snow globe  the most snowfall Ive seen in my life. I think since we were in a rich neighborhood the people get their driveways plowed with those machines that renner was driving like a lawn service  just automatically. one of those guys that didn t have to  totally saved me by pulling my 2-wheel drive truck that was stuck in ice out  Im a big guy  so I was able to just pick up the part of my aunts subaru that was stuck and push them out  but I could not pick up my truck. it was so frustrating and cold dealing with all thatsnow  I cant imagine what renner went through. digging up a whole driveway with 3-4 feet of snow with a little metal shovel sucked too. on the way home from there  there was literally boulders falling off of the mountain  way big enough to instantly kill  everyone  in a vehicle. roads were icy on the cliffside on the way back down  if you went like 40 or above  it would have been easy to just slide off and fall hundreds thousands of feet. really freaky weekend.
mayor of kingstown season 2 is finally fixing to start too! really hope he comes out of this quick   makes a full recovery!
amen
amen!
I really hope he recovers. jeremy renner seems to be a lovely chap. itsounds like a horrible accident.
the legs have very large arteries feeding blood to the legs and feet  so traumatic injuries to the legs can often be life threatening.
feel better soon  hawkeye.
keeping him and his family in my thought
ouch. definitely prayers for mr. renner
prayers for jeremy renner. doesnt matter if I agree disagree with his politics or beliefs. he is a human being  and I was entertained. respect.
bless it. get well sir
I hope he is going to be ok.
prayer and blessings to that jeremy renner  great actor  decent human  good family man.
we lost ken block and almost jeremy in the same day. take it easy 2023. r.i.p. ken.
omg jeremy injured I hope he s doing better now.I hadn t herd that until seeing your video.thank you melonie forbringing this out
how do you go from driving that thing to having a leg crush by it !....well anyhow I hope he makes a full recovery
hope he s ok
get well brother!
praying for him
hope he makes a speedy recovery  thatsounds awful.
congrats on the 100k.  from anna s  brittany s  chrissie s  krista s  steph s  and your stalker.
hope he s okay
I remember that great snl skit he did making fun of how little hawkeye supposedly contributes. showed he had a good sense of humor. I do pray he ll be alright.
makes me wonder  now if someone is behind this. well at least he is ok .
he passed away.
if I was a betting man  I would say he will lose his leg.some positives  outside of him living through such a horrible accident  would be we get to see the latest cutting edge prosthetics a rich person can afford  which will eventually be the norm for the rest of us . I think we would all rather have a regular leg  but at least we have come far enough to have some impressive tech starting to integrate.other than that...I dont have much thoughts on it. he played a good hawkeye and I cant think of anyone that could replace him.
best of luck to him. he s in good hands.btw  for future reference  its pronounced wash-o. thats my old stomping grounds.
wind river is another great movie of his. I immediately thought of it once I heard this unfortunate news. check it out if you haven t.
regarding the  potential  investigation... some people will remove or bypass safety shutdown relays  ex  on a riding lawn mower  which will allow them to get off the seat without the engine cutting off.. most likely not the same with a snowcat which should keep the engine running  but should never be able to move forward or back without an operator s butt in the driver s seat.
hope he is ok
he may lose that leg. the neighbor needed to tourniquet the wound.a tourniquet is a last resort to stop bleeding  it can result in killing the limb below the tourniquet.
Lord be with him and his family
I will pray for him.
I love  your tangent in this vid.it was most  enlightening and refreshing.no need to apologize.
thats a big snow cat. they are also used to maintain downhill skI trails.they dont just flip over unless you are not carefull. but hey  we are men  shit happen. hope he recover soon.
jeremy seems to be a good guy  but for his family please pray for this guy. like his music too. prayers.
melonie likes the word  based  Ive noticed. haha but yeah hope he s ok.
I got ran over by a riding lawn mower when I was 7.  I followed my grandfather and when I was buttoning my shirt he went into reverse and we didn t see each other until it was to late.  big toe was hanging by the skin  toe next to it was gone and part of my foot  was gone.  worse pain ever.  it is a super intense burning sensation like my foot was emerged in lava.
prayers for all that no matter what your religion is your opinions your thoughts are colored youre pretty pretty for those in need make the world a better place
will pray for him
how the heck did that thing with such a low center of gravity and so wide end up flipping over on him  you either have to push that thing to the absolute boundary or something malfunction happened.
ok  first of all - your head is not fat!   second - jeez laweez!!! no action actor  however experienced they are  should be expected to take that much punishment. . . I hope jeremy renner pulls through too. . . thirdly - thank you for your video
r.i.p jeremy renner
this is some heart breaking sh!t man  he might never be ever to act again after this  damn hawkeye not u.
I still dont understand how it could happen.
ouch! I cant even imagine being in thatsituation dude. like the sheer amount of pain
if it rolled and he tried to jump off  thats how. with mhe or large machines like this  you are seat belted  brace  turn away from the direction of the tip over. most industry deaths involving these machines is driver error and trying to ditch instead of hanging on for the ride.
I liked  hawkeye  and I thought he and haliee steinfeld were good together. and right now Im at the end of a  black widow  binge.  endgame  is wrapping up  elderly cap just gave sam the shield.    Ive heard he wants to get away from the movies to spend time with his family. which makes him the kind of guy we need around.
love you mel  lovely sentiment
air lifted   thats bad  like potentially losing a leg bad  or worse  hope he ll be ok
I hope jeremy renner is ultimately ok. I do not want to enter 2023 with worse news than this about renner.
hmmm  so now we have to see if the next part of the story is this an error by the driver or did someone mess with his snowcat.
he seems fairly neutral but no one wants people to suffer no matter their views.
glad he s ok!  great guy  he seems  yoda speak  also... more blood witcher replay please!  2x speed replay is so entertaining!!!
yes 2023  starting weird wishing for jeremy renner to be fine soon and sure some prayers are needed.
gotta pray the this man is ok.....hes my fav just cuz Im a bow hunter and hes the only1 that uses my weapon of choice lol
sending best wishes
loved the witcher retelling!  more please.
prayer for legolas to get well fast
there is power in prayer. - based gamer girl
how the actual hell did he flip a snowcat ! ! ! these are used in horrendously steep applications on mountain sides in the road and skI industry  as well as others. they are used because of their absolute stability. no offense to jeremy  and I hope he recovers  he s definitely one of my favorite actors  but he must ve been doing something completely dumbass to flip that machine. would love to hear his take on it!
I wish I was close to his location to donate
I hope he doesnt lose his legs
latest news is he was trying to help someone that fell in the snow and he pushed him out of the way and got caught by the vehicle after saving him
hate it for him and his family he seems like a decent guy
what I like about jeremy renner is he s here to entertain not talk politics.  Im veyr grateful that he leaves thatstuff out  so I can enjoy watching him and tune out from all the stupid politics for a few hours.  hope he has a good recovery!
leg injury equals bleeding out very much life threatening.
given the  critical  description  I d say its very likely a femoral artery was severed.
I disagree with him politically but I pray he gets better and makes it out alive
I believe there s foul play involved somebody was trying to hurt him on purpose
itseems like he wasn t plowing his own driveway  he was plowing the highway for everyone. also  its wash-oh  and nuh-va-duh a  like apple.
I hope jeremy renner recovers.
prayers are thoughts and meaningful to know you are in people s....but if the surgeon walks in to my appendectomy and says the most powerful thing I can do is pray.....slap him for me.
Ive always thought he was a good actor. I dont know his politics  but thats not a bad thing. good to see an actor who doesnt care about clout.
he will be okay - he is hawkeye!
yea  a snowcat flipping  that deserves investigation. best of wishes jeremy.
scum bags celebrating this are the lowest of the low.  what s he ever done to them   wishing him a quick and full recovery.
please Jesus give jeremy your healing touch  please do so in such a way that he gives you all the honor and glory.
you dont have to tell us youre not going to tell a joke. I know this is a hard topic to start. just get into the subject matter. having said that I dont know renners politics and dont care ! I like him as an actor and he doesnt shill leftie talking points so he s cool by me. I am hoping he s not in as bad a state as was first reported. Imean a leg injury can indeed kill you !
I saw this on the news last night  but I saw the video of jeremy renner being lifted up the rescue chopper on a show call deco drive in south florida local news entertainment show...p. s...any more trouble with the  guy stalker
ken block didn t make it into 2023 for long  he has died after a snowmobile accident.
very sad ...
its sad that his ex wife is dragging him trig the mud amber herd style. how he makes it through without loosing his leg.
have a great year!!!
you are a great disciple of Jesus Christ. thank you for your example.
did he hit the femoral artery or something  to be in critical condition due to blood loss in leg
I pray God uses this to bring him to Jesus Christ and heal his wounds
people are doing that  where
renner seems like one of the few actors in the mcu who is actually pretty cool. he doesnt act like a woke bitch.
kill the messenger  was a great flick.
renner had a bad legal divorce. I hope it isn t but foul play isn t out of the question
30-45 minutes ago  everything always stated he s conscious  out of critical.. had a bad snowplow accident  major blood loss  leg wound  femoral artery
Im calling bullsh-t on this story.  it is extremely difficult to flip a snow. they are designed to drive up and down mountains.  the only way to flip one is to drive off a ledge and and if he was wearing a seatbelt  it would be impossible for him to run over himself. something else must  have happened. he ll be luck if he doesnt lose his leg.
he may have lost the use of his leg.  renner has always come across as a regular guy  no matter of his political inclinations.
the femoral artery in the thigh can cause critical blood loss. it likely got ruptured.and speaking of a terrible way to go  a airline worker got sucked into a plane engine intake.
yes I totally agree about the Bible!! I go to Bible studies almost every week and its amazing!! prayers for jeremy!! he s one of my favorite mcu actors.
if there is an ivestigation  that means he was drunk.
I cant believe the wokies are attacking this guy when he s lying in a hospital bed. hope he recovers smoothly and quickly.
imagine being a steelers fan and thinking you are witty. its like riding the short bus and thinking youre a rocket scientist.
I know the mcu tv has been pretty lame but I liked hawkeye tbh. him  kate and yelena were good. hope he s ok
was brie larsen driving the snowplow in all seriousness  hope he is okay.
ya know now that I think about it  probably got air lifted cus of the snow on the roads or something
leg injury could lead to critical condition if thigh artery was severed sorry dont know anatomy very well so dont know name
sugnficant bllod loss with a leg injury make me think he sliced his femeral arterie ..if so if his neibour wasnt there he would be dead...get well soon j
he lives in tahoe  it nice up and its home of the world famous rubicon trail
yea I thought he had died  I seen pictures of tweets saying he was dead.
lucky to have a doctor next door.  sounds bad with his leg though...
he probably lost a leg honestly  hopefully not though... was he inside the cab  I dont see how he got hurt unless the machine just decided to take off
no foul play. he prolly just didn t lock the brake and bad shit happened. no bad talk about thoughts and prayers. its a good thing whether you are faithful or not. people in youre thoughts is never anything but good.
wheres this happening
@budgie cat  it was on twitter but I think they ve backed down thankfully.
congratulations on 100 k
when youre that rich  thats why you pay someone to do it.


crime scene if he was in a dwi!! an he has a history of being an alcoholic
just a reminder. melonie drink some water.
he wasn t even on a mission
heard this - scary -  Godspeed!
who is the medical professional that listed him as critical   or are we just sharing rumors and not facts
what    crime scene
no refunds. sad.
so asian girls but now lahn doesnt exist  and hahn lee and her recently retired mom are now these hot asian girls weve always known...strange times
good vid siski
the cab is protected from flip overs.  more likely he got sucked under the tiller.his legs   according to reports he also suffered trauma to his chest.  in 2018 he fractured his right elbow and his left wrist filming tag.  at least he knows how to protect his head.  he is on my list of actors that dont look like an actor done right.  prayers yes.  but not for that laughing hyena at sydney watson on vice.
ultron said he wasn t done yet
tell God if we can keep jeremy he can have mark rufalo.
ohmylooolohmylolohmyloooooool
what I like mark ruffalo.at least in the early mcu.and personally I rather give a lot of other people instead. but those are bad people like horrible.
ffs  new year and already starting bad  @
sounds like femoral artery  maybe
you mean too pretty to lose him but yea prayer go out to him and his family but the a lock on the cat that can move and ran home his foot or leg
weird ken block died in the snow
disney is starting to take out all of the avengers cast so they cant come back. somebody keeps eyes on rdj  he s already looking pretty frail
love you
never jump from mhe or vehicles. seatbelt  brace   turn away.
what is it with people and skI and snow accidents  first schumacher  then him  and now ken block  frigging God damn snow and snowmobile accidents
go to the gym!!! and hydrate!
where s cole train
commenting to feed the algorithm
God has a hand on him    !!!! the guy was just ran over by a fricking snowcat  having is life on the line and God is on his side ! ok....
you said but ken block died in a snow related accident
he never did apologize for his portrayal of a soldier in the hurt locker. fake. hopefully he s ok so he can still do so.
surely if there was a God looking after him  he could have had him not run over by a snowcat
oh thatsucks
the woke reaction to this has been disgusting.
omg
who is jeremy renner
reminder that a joke with  winter soldier  is low hanging fruit and disrespectful atm.
@chandler burse  every grunt out there.  and you are welcome.
@hidalgo house  I kind of doubt every army soldier actually gives as much of a damn as you do.and honestly I prefer thanking soldiers who dont clearly want the praise and also enjoy the attenton.since those are the real heroes.
@chandler burse  no..just us vets who were there. the pogs could care less.
so for God to exist  everyone must live with a protective bubble around themselves  insulating them from any and all tragedy you do realize you are appealing to a moral framework  which would be impossible if we lived in an amoral universe  the only way a moral code works is if there is an unchanging standard in which to ultimately differentiate good from bad  and God is thatstandard. man cant be the standard of what qualifies as ultimately good as man s standard of what qualifies as good is constantly sinking.you cant even invoke your argument against God without him.bad things happen. we live in a fallen world because of sin. even the son of God wasn t immune to tragedy. but there will come a day when God sets all things right  and judging by global conditions... that day of judgment could be fast approaching.
youre online goofy. google him
living under a rock for the past 15 years or just trying to be special
where s alec baldwin
reasons why people wont invest right now  crypto crashing  record inflation  bear market fears  rising interest rates  housing bubble talk   but maybe  these are reasons to invest now
good thing the neighbour was a doctor and not a priest or the pope or such
a snow cat to plow a driveway   I live in nh  they use those to groom snowmobile trails and skImountains. f n rich people.
what is going on with mcu  what ever political or sexual thing going on  when I see those things  I dont really pay too much attention to it. I could care less tbh  I am neutral in the culture war.
yeah sure  God saved him  p not the doctor  the chopper pilot  or the surgeon s  that being said  hope he recovers quickly and works on it instead of praying that a God intervenes
how is there power with prayer. prove it
maybe now he will believe inn God . if you not heard but jeremy renner is an atheist . but I hope he feels better
personally  I dont believe in prayers  there s nothing in my life thatsuggests that there is an almighty  I had cancer very young  and the treatment continues to cause my body to let me down in new and interesting ways  but anyone who says they ll pray for you and they believe  is doing something so kind and loving for you  I dont think any of there thoughts and prayers helped me  but they did  so why would any reasonable person dump on that. there are people who will say love and prayers  but only as a pleasantry  those are meaningless.
ttttabloid...opportunity! grandma content. pretend youre a game reviewer...and review a game...not so much a celebrity injury review. which would make you a tabloid.  its like a pick your path adventure. are you a  gamer or a pretend journalist
they ll make this trump s fault somehow.  p
what a stupid way for the article to phrase it   weather related accident .trying to imply subconsciously to the reader that its climate change so everyone be scared of climate change. his accident was not weather related at all.
ok calling something a  weather related incident   sounds sooooo stupid
prayer is only valuable to people who believe.... to everyone else  its absolutely worthless and the only thing that makes it ok  is that you know the person praying actually cares.  other than that actual medicine  money and real love  that involves 2 way conversation and affection and unconditional love  none of this  do what I say or rot in torture for eternity  bull shhhh.  sounds real loving. lol sorry but people learn n change  so to think any actions punishment should last for eternity is an absolutely idiotic.    n free will is a lame excuse... no one has free will. we cant fly because God made us not able to fly right  no matter how much I want and wish to choose to fly... I cannot  by design. so why couldnt he make us  by design  unable to murder  just like not giving us wings he could have not givin people the capacity and or ability to murder. he s also suppose to know you before you are born  and even though he knows all the atheists will never believe  he still creates them knowing its just to send em to hell for eternity. he can choose not to make sin  evil n people who will never believe. they never even have to know what free will is  or the joy pain of existence  knowing they are doomed for eternal torment because of they way their God chose to make them.... or is this all mighty good not that powerful  not all knowing   or does he not love us enough to take away the torture and sin. just because your child wants to throw themselves into a volcano... are you going to let them  you love em right  exactly.
after it all crashes then you invest. get the stuff no one wants for dirt cheap. then your losses are minimal if things dont pick up. everyday as food goes up your money is worth less. its good now to have a lot of precious metals on hand. the value is to all the hassle that chaotic market causes

people are ignorant of profitability in bitcoin investment and that has been the major issues limiting their investment.
sarcasm on exactly. worst thing that can happen to a human is die and go to heaven. staying here on earth in this meat prison that degrades as the time passes until we end up old weak walking dead type of people is the best. sarcasm off

@maria angela  hey youre not far from making profits  he has taken care of my account for months. I have 12 wins so far.
this seems like another bot comment convo that youtube needs to purge
as much as ive been ragging on certain religious aspects in comments despite being a Christian myself the whole God saved him thing is a personal belief and quite frankly its so dumb to be like  no the doctors and rescue crew did  they know this they just believe God made sure they did. because some people arent saved in time by those people.
it doesnt matter if he is a Christian  atheist  pagan or anything else.  lots of people believe in different things.
hoping bear death accidents will convert someone is quite malicious despite how you make it out to be.
climate change
it involves snow so
