yup  most male-dominated hobbies were full of people who would have absolutely loved to have more females involved but youre 100  right about the trojan horse effect. people came in to intentionally ruin these hobbies. good to see you back on regular content.
r.i.p. james bond we will miss you
this is why doom and doom eternal were such massive success in the modern era of gaming. no nonsense  just challenging badassery.
as a child growing up in the 80 s  the bond movies were always a father-son bonding thing that I had with my dad.  its really sad that they are so intent on destroying something that had such great memories for so many
women liked james bond exactly the way the franchise already was. my mother talked about how she and her friends  when they were teens  all thought the movies were chick flicks because of stuff like the musical openings  the tough dude with the gorgeous women  all the glamorous elements like the settings and clothes  etc.
it takes talent to create an enduring character that lasts for half a century. it doesnt take too much to destroy that.
things have gone from  I wonder if hollywood will ruin this iconic franchise   to  how badly will hollywood ruin this iconic franchise. just buy the original books.
great highlight on this one. james bond is supposed to be for men what harlequin romance novels are for women. he s supposed to be a suave  refined  and eloquent womanizer who shoots all the bad guys with impeccable timing while playing with hi-tech gadgets and saving the world in every movie. thats the classic 007 formula. dont need to change that formula at all. I agree with you big on this one.
hey melonie  a small secret for these paywalls  you can see the full articles in archived pages or by hitting f9 as soon as the page loads  before the banner appears. thats text only mode  so you lose the pictures. just dont show youself in the video opening them like that   just in case  you could have them preopened on a tab.
4 52the people who do this  infiltrate with a purpose.  it isn t about enjoyment of the ip  it is a subversion to the established fandom  in an inverse confirmation bias.  in other words 1. invade the fandom.2. attempt to rally within the fandom dissent.3.  when a minority of dissenters are found within the existing fandom  foment more dissent and demand changes.4. when changes are made  then berate the existing fandom for not liking the changes by calling them immature or other pejoratives to minimize their counter dissent.5. gaslight the outsiders by expressing that  insert random person within the revised fandom   they  were always a fan of the ip and expressing that they love the changes and that the  actual  fans who dislike it  are deplorable  or other such sort of deriding commentary .it is a 5 step process.  same process was used by a person who s name rhymes with  I need a shark median .1. after admitting thatshe wasn t a gamer  she came up with a  justification  to invade the game industry to promote her ideology.2. found soy-boys to wrap around her finger  within the industry.3. found developers who would adhere to her ideology.4. made videos  in a series thatshe e-begged for money  and never completed  not only deriding the industry  but also got the developers on board with the same angst against their fanbase. going to developers  critiquing games as they adhere to her ideology. 5. going on news interviews in order to claim that the gaming community is chock full of misogynists.it is a strategy.
james bond is a franchise Ive watched since I was a kid  love the classics  already didn t like daniel craig. some decent films  but they were already not bond films. brosnan is my favourite bond and what I d hoped they d return to. welp  guess its another ip down the drain!
this is so sad this happened to bond.  I could barely watch the last one they made at that.   bond  bond movies  always served as a fantasy role model- meaning I inserted myself in that persona when I needed a boost of confidence in tough situations.  I started traveling the world solo in my 20 s and I used thatsuave world traveled ego to help hoist me out of fear  anxiety  etc.  I even had soundtracks from the movies on my ipod on bus rides.  he was a role model I could look up to in those situations  for the essence of adventure.  he doesnt need to be gentrified or toned down  that completly destroys his essence  and I couldn t see that new character inspiring young men.
the simplest answer is to ignore them and their products. same concept as dealing with crazy people who do inappropriate or gross things. dont react and they will stop. every time we we give them attention it makes them want to do it more.
Im glad I finally found somebody who also feels irritated about obsessive cut scenes. idk why it was hard for me to find before but Im glad somebody sees my pain
love the respect and appreciation that you show for classic franchises like bond.  I d love to see you do a james bond movie reaction series of videos starting from the first bond movie on.  I have to also say that I quite enjoyed your guest appearances on friday night tights.  all of you looked like you were having so much fun.
dead space is good example of this the 1st 2 were masterpieces of horror and action  then 3 came along and the studio said we need to make this more accessible to more audiences and crashed it into the ground
that thumbnail  lol. this one might have hurt more than the splinter cell one yesterday  if the last few bond movies hadn t been terrible. I grew up with bond and dr. who and they ve both been butchered. on a positive note  blue is a great color for melonie
james bond is devolving into an emo guy
another problem with entertainment today is that they are too on the nose with their messaging and themes in the stories. there used to be nuance  subtlety  and great allegory  but that doesnt really exist anymore.
I never got that whole  everything must be so I like it  Ive been living with my girlfriend for almost a year now. she loves stuff I hate and hates stuff I love. yet we can both enjoy what we love and live under the same roof. for example sometimes she blasts kpop  I put on headphones and listen to my music. dont understand why  new bond fans  cant just put on their headphones and enjoy what they like
same with gaming bro  Imiss when it was just a nerd hobby. now its gone mainstream you got all these feminist who dont even play games and lame ass casuals coming out here trying to tell us that the hobby needs to be  for everyone  and more inclusive  needs more females in this or that postion and the entire  corporatisation  of the industry. gaming is just another platform for woke activists and betas to preach to everyone about toxic masculinity and all these other made up terms now. its sad.
@likeandsharedeeznutsbruh  too much lgb tq  in stuff cant even go outside without seeing that  flag  around children schools either
@fried chicken  my local high school here in australia put up  he they  and  she they  signs on the bathrooms. its beyond a joke.
there is absolutely nothing keeping women out of male dominated hobbies.my entire life Ive been in strongly male dominated hobbies and we would love to see more women.the newest hobby Ive started is building and flying quad-copters. guess how many women are into that  I would say there s maybe 5 . but thats not because anyone is bullying them out its because they re just not that interested.
@fried chicken  woe is you
@likeandsharedeeznutsbruh   women play video games now  how dare these feminists ruin male spaces   funny conisdering that gaming was never a male space to begin with  because gaming has always and will always be made by and for both gedners
@carl on duty  simping hard for the woman that are never even going to acknowledge your existence today huh
just will not watch the new one..they can loose more money like rings or power and all the other bs movies and shows..
if there is one non-woke producer in the entertainment industry that we can call a sleeper agent  if we really want to get them back for what they did to james  have our agent resurrect him in the next film.  no matter how ridiculous it might be or put in a flashback scene where he kicks soooo much ass in a 10 to 15 minute clip he outshines the lead character that as soon as it ends everybody just walks out the theater because that was they needed..
he bounced back from wimpy feminist timothy dalton he will bounce back from this as well
as far as Im concerned  pierce brosnan was the last actual bond.  1962 - 2002 was the franchise.  its been over for 20 years now.  so enjoy the old films and ignore all the in-name-only crap thats been put out since then.
@jvr  yeah  me too  20 years after the franchise ended  and now every known franchise has ended... is there one still alive     I cant even care any more... Imean I dont know what these craig-movies were  would have sold aswell as mission impossible  fast and furious or charlies angels  rambo  terminator... whatever title you imagine  but nothing like james bond in any means was left in that movies...  if they wanna go even more woke than that... good luck  what you have then... peter pan  -  whatever... whereas cant even be  as him being a boy dreaming of boy things...but as world goes now  all movies are the same anyways  heman  shera  rambo  shehulk  terminator  wonderwoman  superman  allymcbeal see no difference there any more...
@likeandsharedeeznutsbruh  its funny  I bring a rational and fact based reply to the table  and all you can do is to call me a simp  literally no counter argument  just calling me a simp. I said it before and I ll say it agian  gaming has always and will always be made by and for both gedners. continue with the personal attacks but that aint gonna disprove my statement.
@likeandsharedeeznutsbruh   woman who cop a beating for leaving the house without a man   any right wingers wet dream  eh
@carl on duty  I love how you assume Im right wing lol Im somewhere in the middle. I dont like alot of conservatives hypocracy when it comes to gay folks. but the idea that feminists aren t out here ruining everything for everyone is somehow a sexist view is funny. its not sexist to state facts.
@likeandsharedeeznutsbruh  I like how I never even called you right wing.
stardew valley needs assault rifles - I dont feel represented in my game play choices.
if thats the kind of game you like. if you are I to rpgs then no its not good.
is doom eternal good  Im hearing a lot of mixed reactions
@viktor vondoom  its good  but its crazy hard. which is perfect for people like me who want challenging games.
@viktor vondoom  mixed   who are you talking to... it was very positively recievedits pure hard violent gameplay focused
@ruthless edgeboy  I beat it on hard and it was definitely top 3 most challenging gameplay experiences Ive ever had. normal is not too bad.its no dark souls though lol but I always found those games to be challenging not in an exhilarating alright I need to get good kind of way  but in a I d literally rather being doing anything else than walking through half this stage and fighting this same boss for the 6th time kind of way lol
@ernievzla  I dont remember the source unfortunately. it was so long ago. I remember being excited for it  but then not picking it up because of said reviews. which is why im asking people who ve played it whether its worth picking up.
@viktor vondoom  better then the first one  doom 2016  imo. and I loved that one.
@mikell czermendy  hmm .. might pick it up then. thanks
@viktor vondoom  I am in the vast minority of people who didn t like doom eternal...for me it was way too much turning everything up to 11 and making things too complicated in an effort to make the gameplay challenging.to me it lacked the simplicity and charm of doom 2016. the difficulty spike made me not enjoy it either.
same here I was a kid in the 80 s and my dad mad me watch a james bond movie with roger moore as bond. I loved it instantly and wanted to see more bond movies. what their trying to do now with future bond movies forget it. not interested at all.
it already happened. I like daniel craig but his bond was a pathetic loser with mommy issues. after skyfail I couldn t watch another bond film.
well now its going to be a trans bonding thing...
one of my closest friends has like the exact same story this would break both him and his dads hearts probably. we ll see how bad it ends up being. I probably wont watch.
you had your fun with bond  now its our turn
@huey  lol! your turn to do what  turn him gay or trans or something...
@michael quaid  cope
@nimz  I didn t think parts of specte were so bad but last film sucked.  why built up blowfeld to kill him off who comes up with these stupid ideas.
both my parents loved the bond films growing up my mom even more than my dad.  to make bond a weakling and outdone by every woman is a terrible idea.  since when does q have to be gay as well.  just not needed at all in a bond film.  my mom liked bond being a badass male not a pussy.
yourealise doom and id software are legitsjw hubs right  classic boys situation where the antI woke right dont realise the art in question isnt on their team lol
@huey  Im not even sure what youre talking about
@3rd gunman  thanks for your input
my mum is 70 and still says to us which one she thought is the sexiest funny and disturbing all in one
james bond is was iconic because it appealed to both sexes.
its because women also love men like that  handsome  tall  brooding  wealthy  successful  powerful  abundance of options  etc.. men aspire to be them  women aspire to be taken by them.
this is an excellent point. my mom would talk about the fashions  the exotic locations  the amazing stunts. a  guy  movie isn t just about if the star is a man masculine. Im sure woke hollywood doesnt understand this and will remove all of these other aspects that make the franchise awesome.
@carl on duty  its not jordan peterson  its actual scientific data. I cannot discount your personal anecdote but I will place scientific data  which has no need to lie on this matter  over it. also your neighbors will have a lot of fun raising other men s children   the proportion of childless men  at age 40 years  has increased rapidly for norwegian male cohorts from 1940 to 1970  from 15 to 25 per cent . for women  it has only increased marginally  from 10 to 13 per cent . this is because  again  women tend to only want the absolute best.
evil cannot create it can only corrupt or destroy
sit back and watch they re going to do it with one movie just like the last jedi
and in a couple years it will be  it has merit that they managed to destroy that iconic franchise so much.
what s the problem  the producers are saying the  formula  was changed when daniel craig offered the character more emotion. thats what they meant.
Im a woman  and I look at james bond like you do.
y all need to look all across entertainment to see its even bigger than yourealize.clearly they are determined to destroy or replace every single iconic white hero or character we ever loved
I agree with every word except that harlequin book. I would pick bond movie any day over romace novel.
@bee  to be honest  I canthink of only one series of romance novels I would pick over a james bond movie  and it isn t from harlequin.  even then  it would depend on the book.
harlequin
@goofy grandlouis  no. I haven t read a harlequin book in decades. historical romance with murder and mayhem thrown in.
@may loo   I didn t know they were called harlequin novels in english   . funny.
@goofy grandlouis  Im in canada. harlequin is a canadian company.
perfect thank you!
@melonie mac go boom  forgot to mention  the option of pressing f9 that Imentioned is in firefox  also works on other browsers if you dont like firefox  chrome specifically removed the option a while ago  probably cause it also removes adds in some pages.
hey  thats a good tip for everyone. thx  bro.
imagine believing anything she says  not like she is after views or subs..lets hear from her ex bf s or gf s
its hard to take what melonic wack is saying in good faith.
blow after blown man...I didnt even sleep last night but I dont think it was related
blue definitely looks good on her. and dr who has become awful.
casino royale was really the last proper bond movie.
they have completely butchered doctor who. the show isn t recognizable.
has already 20 years ago... so...
its what turned me off the current dr who it just felt like heavy handed soap box preaching an issue of the week by people who didn t actually have any experience in it. classism is bad  sexism is bad  pollution is bad  depression is bad  pollution is bad but this time its ocean plastic pollution. I watch shows to escape that kind of thing as I deal with it every day in the case of some things more personally than others I dont need some tv show trying to lecture me about how horrible the  insert x here .
hey arnold had black  white and even asian characters and several homosexuals the entire series was about messaging but it never made the audience feel bad about themselves even if they were the target of that particular episode. f modern day hollywood  just a bunch of racists pandering to the alphabet cult and making women uncomfortable.
@liam warner  Im watching babylon 5 right now  which was a really great sci-fI show form the 90s  and it did themes and politics so well. the writers and creators focused on the writing first message second and the quality shows. nothing b5 does feels so forced  heavy-handed  or like Im being beat on the head with what its trying to say. its still an escape from our reality. they are possibly working on a reboot of b5 and I know they will probably do a heavy-handed trump allegory  love or hate him I dont care  for earth becoming totalitarian. they ll have the people who take over earth say  make duh earth great uhgen!  you d never find crap like that in the original show.
@ironinquisitor  which is the difference. yes political messages were part of older shows and movies e.g. rambo but as you said number 1 priority was always the story. now you have things like the star wars meme of their vision board where they put diversity above good storytelling three times.
@liam warner  classic doctor who   we created a global problem. we have to work together to solve that problem. modern doctor who   humans suck! do better!   doctor who  the green death - political storytelling done right  is a good article.
I would blast kpop too. I wish I had a girlfriend or friend  like her. but sadly most of the women my age I know dont and think Im weird for liking it at 25 as a guy.
well   james bond has changed a couple of times already . I started reading ian fleming s novels   which portrayed bond as a deep cover operative in the cold war . no glitz and glamor or fame   no fancy toys   a cold blooded assassin that killed without hesitation   but was haunted by the men and women he killed . the double o prefix meant they called him in on an operation because the home office had decided someone in particular needed to be taken out . living in the shadows . who learned his tradecraft from the spies of wwiI . if killed or captured   he would be disavowed by his own government . then the sixties happened   with the song   secret agent man   . itsays it all . they made bond a cool guy . then they amped that up with pretty women and fancy cars and tricky gadgets no real intelligence type would use . women wanted him   men wanted to be him   everyone knew his name . all about the glamor and gadgets   a joke that couldn t exist in the real world . the knock-off  spy  characters and shows were hilarious and fun   but not real anymore . that went on way too long . now they want to make 007 a woke black lesbian . a joke Imade on a chat forum years ago   that made the rounds and I regret making now . those imbeciles in hollyweird actually did it . the old bond should have ended with his elimination   before he became a joke   and well before this travesty
thank you melonie for covering this... as a huge james bond fan  I deeply appreciate your cover on this but sorry for the rant on the discord server and on here but I hate the tolerant left  woke  offending me by pissing on my british culture. even queen elizabeth iI loved the bond films  even the older ones! keep being awesome!
I once had a crazy idea  Im not sure its a good idea though  for a bond film  that might take a tiny bit of inspiration from  demolition man  to a degree   buck rogers in the 25th century    minority report  and  terminator  . basically  there is a major crisis that threatens the uk and potentially the world  james bond has to go into cryo-suspended sleep to save his life when critically injured after putting an end to that particular threat orchestrated by the spectre organisation. he wakes up between 50-100 years into the future and becomes a man out of time in an unfamiliar new world  basically. however  he finds that the uk of that future world faces a new incarnation of an old reborn enemy or rather several old enemies in one new all in one form  which again has become an even more significant threat than bond could possibly imagine and the greatest threat that the world has ever faced since the extinction of the dinosaurs... a highly advanced sentient super quantum computer  coincidentally codenamed spectre   with its own personality that has all the worlds greatest criminal and terrorist data and personalities programmed into it  the idea was that it was meant to be able to predict criminal and terrorist behaviour  but obviously  things went horribly wrong  endangering everyone... eventually  this computer reveals it has renamed itself  bond tries to guess what the computer s new name is  and he assumes incorrectly that its blofeld however the computer laughs at him sinisterly and reveals its a new name to be... moriarty...
I just watched all of sean connery s james bond movies a month ago. I noticed how many times if he was  sensitive  he d have died. splitsecond instances where a femm fatale either tried to kill him or set him up to be killed. even with ones that would be his allies. whatever they re planning  its gonna suck because that means everything around them will be more  sensitive
Im a woman who enjoyed watching the old bond movies. I always considered him as a strictly fictional character so I didn t need him to be woke or emotional like daniel craig was.  I regard movies as entertainment.  I dont need to see myself on screen  or base my values on what I see. I depend on real life for that.
bond is now in the friend zone  fantastic.
Ive been a bond fan most of my life and I can say this  every time they release a film they talk about how the women aren t like the previous bond girls and that this is a new take on the character of bond that goes deeper into who he is  and 9 times out of 10 its another bond film with the same types of bond girl we ve seen a hundred times  and there have been a lot of great  strong women in the franchise . I dont have much hope  but I ll wait to see what they do. on her majesty s secret service from 1969 ended with bond crying  so like  Ive seen the character be  sensitive  before and the original flemming novels definitely have more depth than is often seen in the films  but  again  I have no faith in modern filmmakers to not absolutely ruin the character. we ll just have to see.
men want to be him  women want to be with him. that will always be mostly true and losing money will redirect eventually.
awesome points melanie its like they think there s a problem with established franchises having a set demographic. how would they like female centric shows being crammed full of dude stuff  just cause it has one doesnt mean other people cant enjoy it. bond is too masculine wow   also I love that you bring it back to tomb raider   great video!
I want the octopussy goldeneye james bond back
I love james bond! sean connery was my favorite but in my opinion the pierce brosnan era was peak bond  it was the perfect mix of all the bond that came before him. the craig era was all action and moping around  casino royal was the best and it went down hill from there. I dont expect the new bond to make things better and thats sad  we are all losing what we loved growing up
my problem with the bond films is the fact ever since ian fleming passed away the films have been a total departure from his novels. if anything I can only hope they go to the spirit of fleming novels that include making fleming s niece have a say in the direction of her uncle s character.
coming soon to a streaming service near you james bond in  octowussie  watch as 007 gets in touch with his feelings.
ya pretty much nailed it.Ive been arguing for years that too much gate keeping hasnt been the issue  to little has.so many industries have been poisoned because people were to lax or to nice to tell people try to change the hobby to shut up or get out.now we are in the situation we are where many of the things we were fans of have been destroyed and our best bet is to build something new from the ashes and protect the hell out of it
james bond being sensitive while on the mission. well thats the total end of james bond! I want old james bond back!
Im calling it now  they will introduce jane bond in a few years.
I loved your whole gaming rantits not coincidence thatsouls games are such hits... elden ring is a direct response for the trend going on
you got me dying of  wussifacation  description
honestly dont know how you do this as these crazy ahs must wear you down. great to see regular rational people still exist. melonie you give me hope! keep on booming!
soy shaken  not stirred.  jamie bond  probably.
my dad was stationed in england when I was a kid  and my mother is english  and I am with you 100 .
did you even read the interview  its on variety. people are basically creating a story from a twitter headline.
100
and then there are men who want to be him and be with him
brosnan got a bad rap he did a good job
@summer  yeah he did  I rewatched all the bond movies from connery to brosnan this summer and his movies really stood out to me this time.
@summer  bad scripts but the best bond
@frank ramos  mate I grew up on connery and moore and I absolutely loved them both  then dalton turned up and I was very disappointed  brosnan then turned up and completely blew me away  he had absolutely everything....craig just killed bond for me  I cant call a guy who is still tortured 15 years later by a woman he met for a week james bond  neither can I accept him falling in love and resigning twice in the space of 4 moviesbond died the day brosnan handed in his walther ppk and ltk.
me and my wife got a laugh when that last james bond came out and bond is hopping on the motorcycle  clinging to the woman while she drove. we laughed not because a man was on the back  nothing wrong with that in and of itself.  we laughed because the set up of the scene and awkwardness made it look so intentional as a nod to putting old bond in the backseat  it looked silly. it was the forced feel of it that made it goofy. it was actually my wife who laughed first and pointed it out and said how stupid it was.
if he acted sensitive  that could have had him killed.
well  get a load of the new movie.in this next one.. he enters into therapy.instead of all thatshooting   sexist attitude  it will be   2-hour reflection - by bond - about his toxic masculinity.
nah  they ll hire timothee chalamet to be the new james bond.
@jedI smuggler  no  not this upcoming bond  the one after. basically reverse of modern doctor who. instead of the female version first we ll get the gay one first.
@henshinfanatic  so... timothee chalamet  he ll be bond now and in a couples of years he ll come out gay then play gay bond. and when they do make a female bond he ll just identify as female and get the part.
@jedI smuggler  oh youre good.
good one!
you seem like you have logic and common sense melonie  not everything is for everyone  there s so much stuff out there people could choose  but they choose systematic destruction of other peoples fun!
the way to deal with this tactic is not engaging or complaining  its just not watching it or giving it attention.
wow... you explained the issue with woke culture better than Ive ever heard it explained. thanks.I dont agree with all your points on games  but its more of a personal preference thing. I like cutscenes. yeah  its a problem when its the whole game  but I like my games with a healthy dose of narrative. and as for the glowing ledges and interactables  I think the has risen out of the increase in graphical fidelity. games used to look really simple and so it was easy to tell where to go. as environments have grown more realistic looking  its harder to tell what you are supposed to do. this part is probably personal preference  but I hate not knowing what Im supposed to do. Im fine with a puzzle where all the pieces are put in front of me  but if Im just thrown into a field and told  figure it out  I lose interest very quickly
love the series  keep up the good work.
mel talks about tomb raider with the same affection I talk about donkey kong country.she is absolutely right about this. Ive always loved female characters in my media  dixie kong is universally beloved by all dk fans both male and female.the little sibling metaphor is totally appropriate  its like these jerks enter fandoms and then tattle on everyone spoiling the fun.
I grew up on the bronson films and loved each one my favorite scene was the boat chase in tomorrow never dies
evolving  more like regressing. 25 movies was a good run for 007  though. Im beyond sick and tired of this fake  plastic  sanitized world these people that want to create where being offended by something is the highlight of their entire lives  and it is refreshing to hear your take on it as someone who gets it. love your videos! keep up the good work!
great and important topic - I recently saw another video covering this article... I hope you ll follow up on this topic area.to add  my first red flag was when black moneypenny starting shaving bond  with a classic razor blade   I believe she was on her knees  as well...
I feel the same way about the assassins creed franchise as you do about tomb raider. Imiss the older simplicity in the creed storylines. I hear that the next one will go back to its roots though. yay
bond is a spy with a license to kill. courage  strength  intelligence   devious ability is baked in. connery s version laughed at danger   was catnip to beautiful women. a role model for me   probably millions of other boys of the day. not every franchise needs to be neutered.
its so bizarre because you never see the reverse happening. you never see men going into romcoms demanding more action scenes and gratuitous explosions.
they just have to ruin our cool masculine male character. like they have changed lare croft so much. watch he ll use a nerf gun and share he s feelings with the bad guy  aka the misunderstood people . anyways good video melonie. have fun today. catch ya on the next video!
james bond is an archetype or stereotype. the sauve debonair super spy. he is the male equivalent of the femme fatale.
melonie you ve got it wrong  if youre enjoying it as is then it is meant for you! back in der day  I the idea that  dis be for boys  dat be for girls yo   is what I had a problem with. having been a goth almost my entire life  and seeing disney flat out tell me that I had to be disgusting  unkempt  and stupid because I was male  and had to be a bad guy because I wore mostly black and have a sizable collection of skulls was annoying and made me hate the company and their habits of putting everything into boxes. blanket statements like  oh youre a girl so you get the pink one  started to really tick me off as a result. but now the fascist twittermobs have managed to make potential allies like myself  actively hate their asses! over the past few years of them trying to dismantle everything and put everyone in boxes  Im completely over their  causes.  now my problem is a bunch of fascist  racist  bigots trying to tell me Im a terrible person because I didn t support a corporate product that made fun of my gender and ethnicity with gay abandon  made fun of legacy characters I actually liked and made strides for peoples  self images  and inserted unappealing characters in their wake while trying to say they re  the bestest evur!!!  despite those same characters holding everyone back! I think Im done with the entertainment industry. until they get ride of these fascist  wokeavist  Im going back to reruns and 20 year old movies.
rip james bond  1962-2002
basically  its the kid who kicks over your meticulously crafted sandcastle just because theirs crumble the moment they lift the bucket. mom tells you not to be mean to them and play nice even though all they do is insult you  so you comply and they immediately push you away from your sandcastle and start ruining it.
pierce brosnan will always be my favorite bond actor. I also like tim dalton and roger moore.
I respect you  for being  100   real  people need to know the truth  about  this stuff like we just want a really good movie just give us a really good  movie how hard is that
I dont care if the audience loves or hates my movie  as long as they react to it.  - rian johnson  director of the last jedI and knives out.  entertainment industry is filled with provocateurs  who can deliver great entertainment with original art  but they have no respect for audiences that follow long term fictional characters.  they have a need to poke to watch fans meltdown.
at the end of the day  I rather have certain franchises ended or retired instead of changing so much that goes against their essence.
bearty  you mean twine
funny how that works
I noticed some people clicked the dislike button. now why would anybody click the dislike button on a @meloniemac video. she makes great content. love ya mel! take care!
no the suave debonair spy isn t the male equivalent. the femme fatale archetype is a villainous archetype.
10000
ninten70  brosnan moore connery for me in that order
I feel like this last daniel craig movie was a symbolic end to the franchise. I wish it was the end. its been one helluva ride since bond first appeared on movie screens.  him getting his happy ending is the best way to end the franchise.
this has been creeping in for decades. I was taught how to be a wuss when I was in school. Im 39 now.
haha the little brother sister analogy felt surprisingly accurate
today I found your channel  what a great addition to my subscriptions list! keep up with the good content!
best part of this video was the 1-2 seconds mel spoke into a bottle. Im just kidding... just kidding... you were adorbs the whole way through.
a sensitive assasin.. what we always wanted.  -p is funny you talk about the games  when I started playing star wars what I really wanted was to decorate my apartment in the game.
assasins creed is a good example of how gaming has gotten easier to be more inclusive  in the early versions some of the side puzzles were quite fiendish and youreally had to think to solve them  are there any at all in the latest incarnations  I stopped playing them after black flag!
completely right with the decay  of modern videogames  so focused on the smoke that they forget about the fire itself.
if there s anyone to blame for castrating bond its barbara broccoli
personally  I love when a woman is interested in male dominated hobbies. if its all guys  to some degree its great. though we all generally want women to be interested in the same subjects. dont need to adjust anything or cater to another demographic  people already became interested because what it was.
my dad has always been a big james bond fan jsut cause he loved spy thriller stuff like mission impossible  jason bourne esc.   its a time thing as times change hollywood is trying to cater to the greater society
just found out about your content   keep up the great work !!
youre a commonsense treasure melonie.
nailed it on the head! Im so tired of them trying to steal our joy. I will turn a game off over those useless press a button for no reason during a cutscene games!
about the games being softer or dumber. I love uncharted! replayed the whole series about 3 times. but everytime I get to a puzzle  I forget how to solve itso have to think about it again. no problem. but what I do remember  is that the side characters wont stop trying to give me clues the second I walk into the room. so  I always remember  enter room  turn volume off.  shut up and let me think for more than 2 seconds! thanks.
well  it was nice knowing you good old james bond...
I ll just stick to the classic sean connery bond. from russia with love is still my favorite.
at the end of spectre bond rode off into the sunset with his bond girl.  thats a good enough ending for me.
for me  the james bond franchise ended when daniel craig assumed the role. not that it was craig s fault the producers abandoned the old formula.
first  conan of cimmeria  now agent 007  james bond  who s next
this is sooo real!!! is what I say about the souls like games  they are made for ppl like me  I like punishing games  I love the grind  the challenge.. why ppl keep asking for an  easy  mode  they keep saying  oh  you can still play it on hard if you want  dont be a gate keeper  when we all know that the difficulty is an integral part of the game.. if some media is not made for you  dont try to push it and mold it to your liking.. is not for you  period..
roger moore a good bond
its funny that melonie mac has more of the innate lovability thatshe hulk is supposed to have  and unlike that awful show  she s not even trying to be she hulk.
hollywood -  let s make a movie like 50 shades with men who are deviant and borderline predatory and dangerous because women love that. also hollywood -  let s make james bond more effeminate.
Ive always hated that practice. you can always tell when the person demanding change doesnt actually consume the product  a certain conartist in gaming cones to mind . Im all for more people joining the hobby but the people that dont like it ought to just go away rather than mutilate it into something that its not.this phenomenon is exactly the reason why in d d the 10 page chapter detailing orc culture and religion in volo s guide to monsters was replaced with a single paragraph in monsters of the multiverse that calls them  proud tribal warriors  and thats as far as they go. people that didn t read the books complained that they were mindless fodder while projecting their own racism into it and now  going forward orcs will just be the same generic tribal template seen everywhere in media rather than have a specific identity of their own thats developed for decades within the franchise.
speaking of the little sibling killjoy  have you seen the lego movie 2   the first one was great  it had a very heartfelt message about the relationship between a father and son sharing a hobby together  very alpha.  the sequel rips that idea to shreds  turns the dad into some neglectful dummy  and basically the plot is that this little annoying sister is glitter ing and rainbow ing and girl ing up all the boy s otherwise cool creations  pissing him off  but the message is that he is the one who needs to let her play and just let her interfere and ruin all his shit. very low-t beta. you should watch lego 1 and 2 back to back and do a compare contrast video.
glad you said you like it the way it is. masculine energy -- thats the beauty of it.
this was why bond was killed off the way he was in the last film  shot 3 times  poisoned  then finally blown up .  the powers that be over there obviously saw what amazon is about to do to that character  so at least there would be no  what if he survived   when amazon takes him   ruins the character.  amazons bond will be amazons bond  not the ian flemming one.  if nothing else  we cantake some solace in that.
...and now  wokewashed  has been added to my vocabulary lol.
I dont get why companies like to abandon or make a game movie s huge and established fan base upset instead it would be better to focus on the audience that the property was designed for and if newcomers want to get into then just let the franchise be the way its intended to be and let them judge it for themselves instead of catering to them with their needs and needless box checking that most companies do these days.
1 28 melonie s signature tomb raider reference
people in the film industry today do not seem to be in it for the film making business  they are out to change old films to fit their own world view  with out realising what people liked about them and what made them so long lasting.
imagine what ian fleming would say with what they are doing to his creation his stories... omg... if I was him - I would be raging -
I ll admit I thought this would happen but like honestly I thought after the last 007 movie that the franchise would fail
I heard about this and that they even thought of making james bond a girl. the point was made if you did that he wouldn t be james bond. Im a big believer in the theory. that oo7 was a code name handed down from spy to spy. but if it was a girl or had a huge change in personality. its no longer the james bond character
exactly the next love comedy or love movie that comes out conan or the terminator or a predator or someone like that needs to come running through the movie and you know completely take over the themes and the plots and just the whole thing see how the women would like it
I agree modern games being too easy or made for casual players but I dont 100  think thats a bad thing not everyone wants to play games for the challenge especially when it makes people angry they keep dying I dont speak for everyone but I think even gamers would want to jump in and play a fun game for a few hours and thats it for the day regardless of difficulty.
anytime thatstate that they want to take a character and make it modernized I immediately tune out. if they dont want my money then so be it. this has been long overdue that mgm wanted to do and  like all properties being modernized  will fail miserably and the fans will be blamed.
imagine going to a restaurant in another country and ordering american food. thats who these people are. they need to feel safe more than anything.
you said it melonie keep rockin  and rock on.
that next bond will be a hard pass from me.
like  why the hell are we changing these franchises  also  didn t craig s bond go through some sensitive  conflicting issues  he had arcs showing he s not just a callus robot. damn  even dalton s bond  my fav   who was pretty ruthless  was able to show some cracks in the armor  but it didn t spill over and ruin how bond is bond. now they re just decided to go all in on the sensitivity stuff when its always been mainly good action stuff.
there should be laws against milking a corpse.
pierce brosnan will always be the ideal bond for me. connery was superb  but his era held him back. the thing they aren t getting though is that bond is an ultimate male fantasy. he gets the girls  he has the toys  he canturn any situation around  and he s just terrific at everything.
if they do this to john wick Im gonna go berserk.
articles behind paywalls is one of my biggest pet peeves.
for those who want to change the original nature of a franchise to feel  included   I have a quote from one of your own   if you dont like it  dont watch it!
the daniel craig era already did that. the last film to  feature actual bond like behaviour was quantum of solace.bond is a charming but cold hearted killer for whom the mission will always comes first.  everything else including the womanising  is simply a means to an end to make the mission a success.
Im finally watching sean connery s bond movies. Im seeing that when I reach the newest ones this will be... interesting
people have to come in and  fix  things that dont need to be fixed
I dont care about 007 s race. I simply want him to be an elegant badass who drives the coolest astons  knocks back martinis in exotic locales  and always has a dime on his arm. until that james bond returns  I ll stuck to the old stuff.
007 is now his testosterone level
I agree with alot of your points but regarding gaming  its a mixed bag. I like games that thrive on gameplay as much as the next guy. hell Im a stealth game fan at heart. but  I also enjoy a good rpg game that basically plays like a movie example  witcher  elder scrolls  dragon age  mass effect. these games thrive on story and gameplay is secondary. the story makes these games worth 60 bucks. I think some games should have story at the forefront and some gameplay focused.
you hit the nail right one the head.. its exactly what I call them. trojan horses.
gee  it makes me wonder how austin powers would be treated in this day and age.
this is why I watch like 2 movies a year   only play games socially. everything is wokewashed.
rip james bond...
itseems like every single one of my favorites series has met the same fate.  its alright though  I just wont give them any money and consider anything past non-canon cash grabs.
sean connery legacy can not be defeated!! long live sean connery.
its like they re allergic to making money.
I have 24 james bond movies in a boxset on my shelf  if they decide to ruin james bond then I have no problem walking away  I have 24 movies I can re-watch anytime.
can you imagine a woke grand theft auto game
melonie makes such great points where it used to be the cut scenes were a reward for hard earned game play.  like the old tie fighter pc game or the warcraft 2 game.  now the technology has advanced so much that the gameplay is for peons who dont have to think or do much to earn the next cut scene.  the older games seemed to be more fulfilling even going back to the nes days of harder than shit games but finishing them was a big deal.  beating zelda for the 1st time or ninja gaiden or knocking out tyson or mr. dream in punchout was hard!!!!!.  no one to hold your hand or easy mode.  I dont think gender really matter so much as great quality gameplay now its reversed gotta have equality in everything but the gameplay suffers.
cuff   brosnan best bond ever and I grew up on connery and moore   both brilliant
keanu would never let it happen
@kingdude1999  they already had that bald chick in pt. 3.  the outlook doesnt seem good.
they literally had wick fighting ruby rose lmao.
@micah ornelas  but she wasn t the main focus   john wick kicked ass the entire movie. he wasn t in any way a touchy feely type. he was out for revenge   in 4 - he teaming up with fishburne s bowery king - they re both gonna be out for revenge for what happened in 3.   I have a feeling john wick 4 is gonna kick all kinds of ass
youre gonna go john wick on them
@kingdude1999  I really hope so  man.  john wick is one of the few franchises I can still watch.  if they ruin this I ll have to stick to foreign action flicks.
@todd reacts  yeah that was stupid.  the bald alpha chick phenotype is so ridiculous.  plenty of movies have had female fighters  like kill bill   but when they do the  Im a serious 98 pound woman  look it just makes me laugh.
exactly!
simon payne  I have to disagree  the only time craig played bond was in the first half of spectre  thats it in 5 movies  he slept with 1 woman in qos
back in the days of the nes  I loved ninja gaiden for its cutscenes ... and then the cutscenes in final fantasy viI ...and eventually games and cutscenes just became as you ve described in this video. cutscenes just aren t special anymore.speaking of ninja gaiden  https   youtu.be 9foiojy8b-m  from back in the day when cutscenese were earned
I worked as a concept artist for the game industry for 2 and half years. I left it... it became a place where activists congregates to make a political statement instead of making pure fun products.every f ing single day my colleagues would just talk about leftists politics  a competition of who is had the moral high ground...even heard these colleagues saying how brazilian portuguese is sexist language when they dont know jack sh   about the language and brazil where Im from .these things will keep happening in the industry  because of a lot of the people working on it are leftists shills. they take pleasure in making fans mad  they dont care about the product  they care only about the   message  ...one of my american friends that used to work with concept art in california left it too last year. many people who work in the industry and dont agree with the   message   is ostracized  its f ing ridiculous.
two great examples of a race-swapped characters the fans had no problem with  michael clarke duncan as the kingpin and jeffrey wright as commissioner gordon... they totally nailed the roles and made the audience believe the character.
yeah  an emotionally sensitive highly trained assassin! I cant believe it.
thats what I love about having a switch  there are quite a few older titles from the xbox  ps2 and xbox 360 consoles on the switch. I can get both kotors  both jedI academies  ff 7-12  skyrim  saints row 3   4  diablo 2   3....there s more  this is just what Im remembering. Im currently playing through marvel s ultimate alliance 3. I beat the previous 4 games in the series and this one is fun combat wise. I hate the watering down of rpgs. they start out with a lot of choice in x-men legends for abilities and then end with only have 4 powers in mua3
I think this does it  Im gonna be the most antiquated man out there lmao
I havnt watched any james bond movies since the pierce brosnan ones and I loved bond movies growing up in the 80s and 90s ...I hate thatsh!  when they do that to movies
most impressive for me is that babs broccolI  despite all of the privileged expensive education she is the recipient of she simply has no idea what  evolution  means and confuses it with bullying and social engineering.
and then  melonie mac was a james bond.
its interesting to think to what we will come to when everything will be made for everyone... no gender specific or lets say  books  not for laymans and for professionals... this is what they are trying to do basically  erase borders  make everyone identical  a bit hard considering  but for some reason most people dont even try to fight it. as for games itself  as a gamers and Imean gamer in a classic sense  I liked when girls joined us  among other things it was good for... how do you call it... behavior  conduct  man are more kind when girls are present  we curse less for example      since iam one of the people who acknowledge that there is a huge difference between males and females in many aspects... it many situation female view can be beneficial  they dont think like us   they can see different solutions to a problem  including better solutions. but at the same time I have always treated  at least tried to  girls just like boys  simple logic - when we played games we were all gamers  equals  more or less skillful  but equals. so if I see that a girl did something wrong I will tell her  explain how not to do it wrong  its not about ... mansplaining  its about efficiency  if for example you want to raid on a serious level be prepared to learn. iam glad my social circle now is at least around 30y.o. so I dont meet a lot of  progressive  people
one day youre playing cops and robbers with the lads then before you know it  its tea time with ken and barbie before going to work at the bank
james bond on the nintendo 64 was the most chad bond
games on the ps3 era were some of the toughest ever. demons souls  mass effect 2  insanity   gran turismo 5  dead space 2  no death mode  etc. etc. loved it all. sadly im getting old and lost some enthusiasm for vg now
do my eyes deceive or is mel doing daily videos now
there was a reason why so many clubs  mainly in old times  dont accept women. it was not about hating women  men love women  it was to preserve traditions  rules and respect for the hobby or topic of each club.
there are a lot of women who love james bond  even sean connery. traditional women love traditional men.
im a james bond fan as well but I cant pull myself to watch this one
yes   ubisoft was considered to make games that held the players hands  like many others.. then came along from software  with their soulsborne games. am I detecting a soulsborne fan
goodbye dry vodka martinis  hello pumpkin spice lattes. still shaken not stirred.
right on. thanks for sharing.
same with morgan freeman as red. the issue is most of these swaps are not because the person is genuinely better at the role its just political casting. take the recent cruella movie where they made anita black and she barely is in the film at all except to be given a puppy at the end.
you know that with final fantasy  skyrim  knights of the old republic  and the diablo games if you take the story out they are pointless games. those games are based around the story.
@evacody124  yeah stories are cool. I like stories in my books  in my movies  in my tv shows and in my games. also  you missed the mark so bad on skyrim calling it a story game. especially since Ive played it dozens of times and have never played the main story. instead  I roleplay in the roleplaying game and basically act as a travelling merchant and occasional spelunker. this is a common trait of the es games  starting with number 3  where you can go anywhere in game and do anything you want. skyrim is gameplay and roleplay driven. not many people actually play the main quests in fact. kotor is really fun to explore in. it was the 1st game I took the time to explore every inch to find every piece of treasure and find all the npcs you can interact with. the story definitely helps  but the gameplay and environments are good enough to draw me in alone. especially since it was the best jedI game of the early 2000s. final fantasy is definitely a movie with intermittent combat to get to the next cutscene  so you definitely aren t wrong about ff lol. diablo  again youre way off lmao. I dont know the story for either of the 2 Ive played. I rushed with my friends for quick leveling and grinding for loot. once again  you dont understand rpgs and Im betting you ve played none of the games I listed. you aren t talking about them from a knowledgeable perspective. diablo 2 is just about dungeon diving and grinding for the top gear. the combat is interesting if you play interesting characters like the necromancer and druid. is fun as hell to clear a map as a werewolf. so you were right about ff  but not that the game itself would be boring without the story. everyone  literally everyone  grinds for levels and scours for chests. these are things no one would bother with if they didn t enjoy the content they were interacting with. when you grind  there is no story
baaahahaha
people dont strive to overcome anything in games anymore these days  not even when playing against other players. they go on twitter and scream for sbmm for  fair  games. fair for their experience  johnny no thumbs  of course  not for anyone actually trying to get better but if you point that out it just comes down to  the sweats not having fun is a bonus . like wtf
your right about what they are doing to loved ip s ...itsucks
if we get anything less than the daniel craig bond Im out and Ive watched james bond my entire life. this is the only movie franchise Ive watch every movie in the theater since golden eye.
you are 100  dead right! I love this video made me a subscriber
james bond wasn t really for the guys either  he s like a relic of the cold war  almost like a caricature. he s the original archer. so it is pretty funny that they want to make him more sensitive   its a misunderstanding of what james bond is. he is supposed to be that way   thats the point.
I dont understand where this  power fantasy  argument even comes from. I dont think most men go around thinking they could be james bond  or identify with him. he s kind of a sociopath  he s just an interesting character because he goes on all these crazy spy adventures that dont happen in reality  or if they ever did were far more grim ww2 missions than the fun movies.
I hear the term  ratioed  a lot  and I think I get the meaning but what exactly does it mean
I work in charity here in the czech republic and I can guarantee you that not a single one of my 12 female colleagues will watch this kind of trash lmao. and I can also guarantee you that all of them have a brilliant sense of humor  self-reflection and do not see sexism in every single damn thing. in fact  it is a part of healthy banter between us. women love to hear they look good  they like to feel special  and we  men  love to be  machos   but sensitive in the same time. thats the nature and there s nothing wrong with that. kudos to you for ridiculing this crazy trend. I really like your passion!
maybe you start watching the james bond movies from the sean connery all the way to the daniel craig era. start watching dr no and end with no time to die.
come halloween you could cosplay lara maybe do some cosplay posters and see if it is worth to do it more.
if you would put a d d alignment on bond  he d be lawful evil. at best he d be lawful neutral. but he s a villain as well  just one thats  on your side . he fucks the bitches  kills the bad boys and goes home to receive his next mission to gain some bravado and glory.if he d be more sensitive  he d not be bond. guy s bad. real bad. and thats part of his charm.
its like a bunch of brats that need to break every toy thats not theirs....r.i.p. james
I rolled my eyes when I heard about this the other day. nobody wants thatso good luck to them. the whole point of why a lot of us like bond is that he s a womaniser.
love this review......
the last movie  he dies - spoiler  and I thought that was fine because we all knew the producers  and new partial owners  amazon  were going to take it down this route. so this franchise died in a good movie with the death of bond and then all of this going forward is  not  bond and not worth my time. I have a ton of awesome bond flicks to enjoy  connery to craig  and that wraps up the franchise for me.
I dont think its the consumers demanding it  but rather the producers compromising the ip to try and cast a wider net and make more money.
vodka martinI shaken........and can I get a slice of lime an olive and a twirly straw  also I d like to see the manager... like where are the napkins .... dear Lord.
a lot of shows in the 80 s and the 90 s where made for woman  but a lot of men watched them and enjoyed them for what they are. but now everying needs to meet so many criteria that it kills the creativity.
bond   jane bond.
oo7 for nintendo was out cold. 4 person splitscreen too
idc if you shoehorn tomb raider. my favorite is the portrayal angelina jolie did
I never thought I d see the castration of james bond.
no we re not. we re devolving as a species.wishing for the asteroid.but not before seeing anna s cosplay as tifa
I never watched 007  loved goldeneye on the n64 though lol.
they re killing off anything good  but its too late to ruin indiana jones
youre  right.
you are the finest tomboy ever.
the new 007  melonie mac!!
you know  halo on paramount  tried to have bigger roles for women and a sensitive master chief  whom my brother appropriately called  feelings chief   and guess how that worked out  it didn t. people dont want emasculated men. feelings bond is going to suck hardcore.
gatekeeping is love  gatekeeping is life
when you come across a paid article  you can copy paste the url to archive ph. I find it is the best at already having the archive.
making bond an insecure sissy is like making captain kirk a non-confident un ensure of him self. he deff wouldn t be the captain. and he wouldn t be as well known even now over  50 years later and is still considered by many fans that kirk is the best captain of all of them. and besides sisko I would say sisko and kirk are the best characters and captains thatstar trek will have for the  foreseeable future.
all for gatekeeping at this point.
I think they re mistaking  evolution  and  masculine downtime  basically the good ol saying  hard times make strong men  strong men make good times  good times make weak men  weak men make hard times  we re currently in the weak men era and itshows.
another great video melblue is a great colour on you!!!are they taking away all the men for you simp lust for
instead of going for a ps5  Im planning on getting a ps2
first off I love your content speaking as an english male I do find it distressing that the younger generation of males seem to be a bit too effeminate and wussie fu   n piss shit. what is happening
they re chopping the balls off all my favorite heroes- splinter cell  james bond...
hearing it again  I guess youre not a fan of square enix s tomb raider. I can understand why though.
the bond movies almost always had an important female character. bond always had a female sidekick  usually saved his but too. not to mention his boss was a woman and moneypenny. do these people even see the things they re ruining
have you seen casino royale
yet every time I gatekeep role playing games and metal music I get people mad at me.
@evacody124  of course they mad  they want in.
I have to confess  I have not been  evolving . I am an old dinosaur just waiting for that asteroid to land on me. and thats okay.
as a lifelong bond fan since 1997  when I was 9  I have mixed feelings about the bond producers. if bond goes super woke  Imay step back from it and just enjoy the old movies.
did hollywood miss the fact that there are a lot of female fans of james bond  or are they going to toss aside that market and then blame dudes for not showing up  my wife is a much bigger fan of bond than I am  though did enjoy the craig return to gritty bond  and she called the latest one  stupid . she is happy to watch matt damon action flicks though  so hey bond s loss right.
hope everyone watching this well God bless.
the world needs a return to true masculinity.
a  more sensitive james bond  is basically an oxymoron.
james bond was part of my childhood games stuff the stories on were as strong they used and the gaming industry is money hungry not focused on qualityI need how is a spy to manstley
yes I can confirm as a man I am evolving  I evolving to stop watching their shows. I didn t watch most of the latest marvel movies  I didn t watch the last james bond  I wont watch the next james bond. yep I have evolved away from them.
and like that another pop culture icon has been murdered before our very eyes...
bond is the ultimate alpha. turning him into anything less than that just isn t bond.
sean connery is by far the best james bond  also pierce brosnan.
I hope bond fans watch old content.
everything has to be inclusive of everybody. except the people who enjoyed the thing in the first place  they re just evil.
5 45 exactlly except for one caveat what they re doing is not out of love its out of hatred
I haven t watched the last 4 bond films. it was already too  sensitive  enough. I actually hope they go full woke. spend millions of dollars in production and watch it crash and burn.
I was so mad that they killed bond in the last movie. and no time to die stole a bunch of great pieces from other bond movies  like the music from ohmss  that were totally unearned. sarif was maybe one of the worst bond villains of all time.
the james bond ps2 and ps3 games were great
almost  everything hollywood does these days is so ham fisted. I ll agree some of bond s hookups were a bit too much - in skyfall he sneaks on board a yacht and assumes its cool to jump naked into the shower with a woman who was sex slave as a kid  and is still pretty much  owned  by the villain. but of course she doesnt even bat an eyelid. the monica bellucI scene in spectre too - as she says  he s signed her death warrant by killing her husband  who was her protection from people who now want to kill her . yet she just  goes with the flow  when he pushes up on her ! thatsaid...hollywood instead of just toning down bond s moves  will reduce him to something almost the complete opposite  while women dont just act like strong women...they ll actually act like men themselves.
I guess loid forger is gonna be my bond  thats fine by me. 007 gonna be taking down uninclusive workplaces in a fiat 500
no  melonie  daniel craig is in a woke crusade against 007 since 2015. he called the other versions of the agent a  sexist  misogynist dinosaur  and promised to never portrait bond like that. pierce brosnan had to publicly come out and say that  007 is not sexist . the writing s on the wall for years... normalized each passing day  unfortunately.
thank you. same to you
I ll be thirty-eight on november 5th and my life is a complete and total misery.
I agree but the other way around
that last part about women acting like men reminds me of what happens in the woman king.
@may loo  yup! you are not wrong there. and Im not saying there aren t physically tough women out there - look at any female mma or boxing champion  a lot of female athletes  probably a lot of women in the armed forces. but when hollywood tries to show women being physically strong  they usually really overdo it. this breaks immersion  and the audience eventually gets sick of being asked to believe something that doesnt look possible. however  it can be done right - elsa pataky s movie interceptor shows her in relatively realistic fight scenes  for a movie anyway  - she does well against the villains but ultimately needs to use her smarts to win  and millie bobby brown in enola holmes did something similar - she has skills and using those she can hold her own against a guy for a bit  not enough to win  unless the guy s at a disadvantage   but enough for her to create an opportunity to escape. I want to see more action like this - where skill and relative strength are used to get realistic results.
no surprise there  my no1 bond brosnan and my no5 craig
james bond is an iconic male character   but the story no longer reflects that  all I want to see is henry cavill as james bond  an insidious plot to threaten the innocent  and an antagonist that is well written yet just a bit campy. fun and ridiculous tech as well. beyond that  no reason to change james bond  making him not sexist is fine  but he needs no one to make him stronger or bad-ass  he does not need to be sensitive to feelings  he can be a gentleman without having to be a wuss or un-intelligent. the female role has always been a helpful aid in his endeavors  nothing sexist about that.
the last bond films that were authentic bond were the brosnan films  and they were just barely bond films at times.
evolving like clownfishes is definitely a recipe for disaster.
disney shareholders are now weighing in on their woke garbage so its only a matter of time boomers so keep fighting and hang in there. hI from australia melonie  love your channel and in the meantime go boom!
his testosterone levels dropped after the ball whipping he received in casino royal.... lmfao
bond was doomed after brosnan stopped playing the part.
Im comfortable waiting the next 10 years when Im in my 40s where hopefully all the wokeness is dead and gone and the studio start to bring back entertainment in all areas that is meant for the original old fan base. until then I ll just keep all my money  watch old reruns and movies from my dvd and blu-ray collection that are pre-woke era that thankfully still give me that nostalgic feeling and support independent film projects produced by filmmakers that just want to make good movies without an agenda.
thank you
daniel craig s take on bond is about as close as you could get to being an  emotionally sensitive  007 without completely breaking the character.
jane bond will return in  octowussy . xd
like how melonie looks up to lara croft and hates her being wokeified. I will do the same for james bond. he is my role model!
yeah they seem to love to do stuff like this  as if the matrix sequels weren t bad enough compared to the first one they had to put the final nail in the coffin with that most recent shit movie. do they just care more about money than ruining their own franchise  gaming is not as bad but still going that direction  its noticeable even the few companies left that I trusted to consistently put out good games and avoid wokeness  like cd projekt and rockstar  are starting to slip like the rest of the industry.
bring back the style of connery. I said it.
as a woman...Ive always loved the hot bond girls...they were always able to beat bond..or be bonds weakness..why is being attractive a bad thing  why is being masculine bad if we get rid of masculine and chivalrous role models...we will end up with people like andrew tate being all thats left.which isn t a good thing for female power in society ..nor good for regular women.
I literally cant get angry anymore  I just dont care. they want to fail so I say let them
nobody works in entertainment to intentionally destroy it. the problem  to me  so maybe Im wrong   is the last few generations of entitled everyone-gets-a-trophy go out in the world and become extremely insecure when they see anyone stronger than them. the entire woke push is a revenge of the nerds. tear down anything not either gay  freaky and make every tiny person with no muscles be the strongest around in entertainment. the nerds took over and now  in their mind  they are pushing to make a world where they are the alpha  oblivious to how impossible that is. so it all comes down to the insecure trying to flex. dont get me wrong  I say nerds  but I dont mean all. I like all kinds of nerdy stuff myself. its not all nerds. its the nerds with emotional problems and chips on their shoulders all got in the entertainment industry and they re trying to shape it towards themselves. all while calling it inclusive.
the actual interview is on variety  no paywall  but I honestly dont see what the big deal is. did youread the interview the headline is  james bond producers search for a new 007 who will commit for a decade   bond is evolving as men are evolving   I dont see any mention about the presence of women in bond movies.the part about bond being  more emotional  is referring to how the producers saw that daniel craig gave the character more emotion.
they should be forced to put participation trophies on the title screen and on the boxes of all the video games that you just described these it takes no skiller effort to beat them vs games and that way normal people can avoid them and the participation trophy base can enjoy there no effort no talent games
casino royale was the last good bond movie  the only good bond movie craig did  and may be the last good bond movie ever.
yeah   I would agree.. I love call of duty campaign. what ever character is performing is the character I assume and fight for.
bond had plenty of moments where he showed a sensitive side - the death of his wife  any time afterwards when his wife is brought up  q retiring  any time a friend of his was killed  but he never let it interfere with the mission. these moments being very brief made them special. its like how nowadays in star trek they have to make spock overly emotional all the time  which contradicts how in the original series he only let his stoicism slip once in a while  and that made itspecial  like when he realized he didn t kill kirk in that duel .
@Christopher trevino  I do agree in that regard  but that is not what I am referring to  I should have been more specific. he is not overly sentisitive  he never allows his emotions or the emotions of others to dictate the outcome of the mission.
@creatv  yeah  I figured that  but just thought I d mention it
he was the best and I was brought up on connery
thats funny. youre funny.but seriously daniel craig was like cardboard. I have no idea when  grim and brooding  became  emotionally sensitive .
@fiction theorizer  I probably have rose tinted glasses from growing up watching craig in the role  but I see his  dark and brooding  take on the character as humanising someone in that line of work  who has to be an emotionless  strictly objective agent.
@blake tibbitts  Im not even convinced that wasn t breaking the character to be honest.
Im a huge bond fan and agree with this
contemporary    wokified . I learn something new every day.
that ll trigger the feminists out of their minds.
@                         all the more reason to do it.
@galadrius the mighty  totally agreed though my favorite is brosnan
excellent comment.
men are evolving  what creepy social engineering is that
@neil varma  how is that wrong  are they not
@backup368  a  who says they need to and b  no if anything they re devolving
@neil varma  did youread the article
@backup368  yep.
@neil varma  so what dont you like about it
@backup368  that very line  men are evolving
@neil varma  men are evolving men are evolving men are evolving men are evolving men are evolving men are evolving men are evolving men are evolving men are evolving men are evolving...
bro  we just want a good story with a good character its obvious they ain t gonna give us one so stop shilling they ain t gonna give you a job
@justin akinsola  so you ve seen the movie already
bond fans know they tried this before back in the 80 s with timothy dalton  he was fired after two films  his pathetic wimpy character almost killed bond before the awesome pierce brosnan saved the franchise. you are correct these psychos enjoy destroying what others love  misery loves company.
the best games I played over the last few years was indie games not aaa !
use  behind the overlay  extension to get rid of those sub olays
great! another favourite franchise to ignore for me going forward. Jesus soon there will be nothing for me to like except for the things from the past.
ethan hunt vs james bond ... do it
Im of two minds about this. men dominated everything for thousands of years and forced women to accept what we liked  so we shouldn t complain. however  two wrongs dont make a right.
Im curious what this era will look like in 10-20 years. and to get a perspective on what exactly caused this woke shift to bleed into entertainment  maybe its already possible to pinpoint it  Im guessing itstarted around 2018
I dont really know if he was wuasifiesd. he still murdered like 100 people in that movie including crushing one with a car.
then  quite simply  he will never be james bond  most certainly not ian fleming s bond. fleming s bond is a classic anti-hero - cold  snobbish  steadfast  moody  has little time  or respect for others or faith in their competence   resourceful  extremely observant and aware and a man with many vices. a man who uses  every means at his disposal to achieve his objectives . he is the antithesis of the  sensibilties  of today s left and one of the last bastion s of classic  masculine characters. its only natural that they would go after him. but do yourselves a favour  dont bother with this upcoming bastardization. instead  check out the original books and keep this classic character and fleming s creation alive.
it wont happen... I cant handle this.. Im in denial
I honestly cant understand why a company that has had a licence to print money  the bond franchise  running for 60 years would think thatscrewing with a successful formula would be a good idea.  does anyone think that people who like sensitive man movies will pay to see a bond movie or that bond fans will pay to see a bond who is in touch with his feminine side    who do they think their target audience is
skyfall was the end of the road for me.  haven t watched the last two installments and probably never will.  like most other things  bond is dead
its like  cant you just make james bond black  or something normal
not too concerned about bigger roles for women and I always thought judI dench was under used. but a  more sensitive  bond  nah. yeah  nah. thats not who he is and not why we love the stone hearted bastard.
hImelonie good God james bondindeed.all these things like video games to now crashing a legacy ofjames bond going to some other dumn way.this is only my opinion itsstarting to feel like strange versionif demolition man minus the cursing lol.thanks melonie for bringing this to life.takecare melonie
james bond was made to appeal to men. of course women can enjoy james bond movies but those were made for men. thank goodness we have the fallen series with gerard butler and the john wick series thatstill embrace masculinity.
bond is the pinnacle of hypermasculinity. and they want to cuckify him. well  good luck to them  as it will completely trash the character. with all the existing fans walking away and new mythical ones  that they pander to  wont materialize...as per usual.
society is devolving
I hope this doesnt happen with ash vs evil dead season 4. ash is a misogynist  he s slightly racist  he s crude  he s arrogant  he s offensive  and I absolutely love it. to change him would just ruin it. taking away these qualities would just make him a regular guy. I dont want evil dead going woke too...
I posted a new video in response to this video.  an alternate ending to no time to die.  I think I put together the ending we all would have preferred. https   www.youtube.com watch v wbdjewobd14
so true  brosnan moore connery dalton craig lazenby
Im already there.
I dont know if itstarted back then  but I d place a bet on ghostbusters 2016 making the world at large aware of it  with actors  directors  writers  producers and studios calling fans  istaphobes  for any critique of the film.
Im referring to what they said about the future of james bond  not a previous movie
they dont know anymore.. they are listening to the twitteratI and the rotten reviewers... why  I have no idea! bond was not even on the vision of the population when he was first written  and even when first presented on film... he was brought as a vision of somthing and the people who saw  were enthralled! cheers!
no he s not. in fact he s nothing like that in fleming s novels.
@gloria thomas  movies and novels are different genres  so in novels he is colder  more pragmatic  cruel even and not as over the top. he is a cold man in a cruel world. but overall he is a very masculine man in both. altho in different ways.
gone with the wind wasn t made for men.the wizard of oz wasn t made for men.the silence of the lambs wasn t made for women.alien wasn t made for women.guess what!!!  good movies are good!
bond producers must be smoking the hard stuff. they think men are evolving - nahhhh. I ll always love t a and will never go down the woke hellhole. james bond retired from duty in 2015  not the soiboI with the fake family dynamic that got himself blown up in 2021.
gatekeep your hobbies!
what s wrong with a strong man and the family he wants to protect   let men be men and women be women
evolving  not me  still rocking my caveman beard.
I respectfully disagree with you when you say that jb is made for men. I know an enormous number of women of any age who absolutely love james bond. both men and women like james bond just the way it was  it is both a male and female fantasy.
I still think pierce brosnan is the 2nd best bond. craig was just silly
what happened to the female reboot of james  bond    jane blonde
men are socially evolving I guess  but the social evolution is men not living lives conducive to their nature. this isn t just men but woman too. we are becoming a very sad a depressed civilization because of it  and instead of encouraging men to be men and woman to be woman we aren t teaching the next generations how to seek things that will not fulfill them. everything is shallow and ideologically driven with the promises of happiness. I think the state of our culture and the amount of people with mental illnesses and the amount of impersonal relationships with no deep bonds show exactly what this evolution of men  and women  is doing.
good thing the older bond films exist I can watch those and skip on new bond
if this is evolution  Im becoming a creationist.
aye  narcissism is at the core of everything they do. the solution is so simple. make their own content. make unique movies  shows and games that reflect their preferences. and from a marketing perspective its brilliant. the companies could keep selling established content to existing customers and sell new content to the wokies. it doesnt have to be either  or. stop changing existing content. instead  make new content while continuing to produce existing content. to put itsimply  two customers are better than one.
if you want a game everybody play games rated e.
everything doesnt have to have everyone included in it. if 007 has always been a male movie  then itshouldn t have to cater to everyone . just like someone saying why doesnt tyler perry or jordan peel have more caucasian people in their movies ! ! its okay to have a male movie  with a male protagonist. just as female. its like saying why is cinderella a girl ! ! why is snow white a girl ! ! thats what mr. walt disney came up with. respect their work.. not everyone s   feelings.
cubby broccolI is turning over in his grave
when are you going to pick up on the fact that men are no longer their target demographic  the industry lost its male audience to games  streaming  and youtube. now they re marketing to and making content for the audience thats left. women and the alphabet soup community. and they found out that those groups are cheaper to entertain and easier to satisfy. its good business.
you mentioned race swapping  what s the difference between that and blackface  are we so incapable of creating original black characters and stories  I asked why cant the little mermaid be the story of a new princess in and undersea african kingdom of mermaids. its just a story title and the original mermaid had no name. ariel is the disney name and basically  they have taken a white character and done a blackface routine on it. I didn t make the character white in the original movie  disney did so why shouldn t I expect the character to be white  in the movie  her father is white and apparently members of her family are different races. look at rings of power as I wasn t upset about different races. in the original mythology  there were black elves and all the dwarves were black. what I said they were doing was tokinizing this and we d see one black character here and there but no races of black characters to explain where they came from. look at the queen of the human kingdom as she s black... a token black queen over what appears to be an entirely white kingdom. now  we have things like this as I fully expected they would replace him altogether with a daughter and be stupid enough to call her jane bond like the porn flick without even realizing. why cant we just develop new content that is written from the start to have black characters  if you want a female james bond then do a 008 movie with a female superspy thats wholly unique  I was addressing the little mermaid and pointed out that even animated characters can have ethnicity as look at fat albert and try imagining that with a white fat albert... it ain t working because they built black ethnicity into the character. I warned is we dont do something to stop this that they re going to keep doing this to white characters... then we get the new velma series and while some of my leftwing friends at first didn t get it  I shared your videos and they get it not. the daphne video you did sealed it and they got what I was saying about the original hanna barbera company thatscooby came from as they would have just introduced thatscooby had a brother who just happened to live with a black kid whose friends also happen to be ghosthunters moreso than mystery hunters... they now get it thanks to your videos and they fully agree. why cant they do that  why not a new dog with a group of black kids  thats how hanna barbera would have done it before they died and the company was sold to wb and they have a few other dogs in the series revealing scooby s not the only one.look at the comics. nick fury was white but then they made him black but they explained it as his mind being put in a new body. as far out as that is  there s an explanation for it. in the daredevil movie  they introduced michael clarke duncan as kingpin and he killed it. but  the kingpin is an identity and wilson fisk is designed as an actual person who is white. so  wilson fisk gets busted and sent to prison so a new kingpin takes over... bam  no controversy and it makes sense now that the kingpin is black. thats the problem with all the race swapping as most of this they can have answers for like captian america is now black because a totally different human is captain america... the same thing I said about kingpin as captain america is an identity. dc comics has a huge problem as all of their characters have been retreated so many times that you simply cant remake them anymore. superman is an alien so explain he lives ten times longer. bit for an average mortal  they should have natural age progression and not still be a teenager like when I was a kid and now Im 80 years old and he along with all the normal humans are the same age as when I was a teenager. antiquation sets in with this as while the metahumans can be explained as immortal or whatever  those who are normal humans with a normal human aging process wont. they ve reintroduced their entire character line at least four times and trying to create new things is very difficult  aka they wont do it  while creating new ethnic characters is impossible  again  they creators are white and dont know how .in the james bond films  008 is often introduced just to be killed. why not give us an actual 008 designed with some of bonds unkillability  make her lower budget to see if it ll work or maybe do it on the small screen... do they not have any imagination in fact  does anyone have any imagination why aren t blacks protesting race swapping when its basically just new age blackface with white creators taking white characters and making them black because they have no ability to create an original black character story.here s the secret... these producers value white culture and heritage but have no value for black culture and heritage. there are numerous african mermaid stories and mythologies. many stories by black creators. disney has many ethnic characters written and designed to be entirely ethnic like mulan. but then you have the frog princess based on a brothers grimm story and european. now we have ariel blackfaced for absolutely no reason except that disney values european stories and heritage so they ll invest in it and just race swap the character to provide a pc experience. but  ask african americans if they think disney would invest even a fraction of what its spending here on a unique and original african story and they ll all truthfully say no!call it what it is as race swapping is pc... blackfacing is the truth!
color me surprised that a bunch of emotional narcissistic misandrists would misuse their power and influence once they have it
my 13 year old son is not buying into any of this woke nonsense. he and his friends just laugh at it  so I dont know who this  modern audience  is supposed to be.
I think its a long term strategy.  they are destroying the old and will introduce the new.
luke m  he s my no1 and I have craig at 5
spinning so fast he drills through the earth.
yet when films and shows are made for that demographic they do well.
unfortunately  the big studios are morally bankrupt and the creatives  writers producers directors  are creatively bankrupt. thus  they decide to take a franchise that worked and has dedicated fans and decide to modernize to satisfy the npc progressives on twitter who never watched the original and probably wont even watch the  modernized    updated   re-imagined  version. you continually see unproven writers being given the keys to huge properties and driving them into the ditch. very few sequels are ever as good as the original. one of the best is aliens - it gave everyone more of what everyone liked in the first. its not rocket science. you said it best -  I like it how it is . you can already figure out the next bond plot. the villain will be some capitalist developer who will be suspiciously like a former president. the new bond be wearing a mask everywhere and he ll be meeting with m via zoom. side plot will be having bond getting great britain back into the eu and discovering brexit was a plot by spectre.
first they talked about a black bond  then a female bond then that bond has to be more sensitive- they are literally trying to make a new character while keeping the audience.
I never like the idea of  gatekeeping  studios from ruining ips  as it is used for gatekeeping people from enjoying the said product and prefer we want  preserve  the legacy of the said franchise and give responsibility to the right people and not let activists and greedy companies change it  work hard in keeping it to what makes itspecial and still allow people enjoy the franchise and respect it.if anything the activists and greedy corps are what gatekeep and change fun of our favorite source of entertainment to fill in their needs and never respect to ip.
thank you melonie for being a woman who like real men. hope u get only the best beef.
the human race is devolving
personally  I dont think the problems start when the wokesters come in. the problems start when the corporations making the products start listening to the wokesters.
with james bond and sam fisher being pussified  at least I still have james reece from the terminal list for new works.seriously  watch the terminal list. its fucking awesome.
my name s bond. james bond. my pronouns are she her they them and my favourite movie is the notebook.
once again instead of creating a new character to fill the niche and purpose that they want  they are gonna highjack an existing character. instantly upsetting a large part of the fanbase and create animosity  because even these writers and producers know that all the have is the brand name. an original character who is woke and a spy would never survive for 25 movies so they have no choice but to highjack james bond
if they believe in what they are taking about they would just do there own movies.
melonie   I dont have to be involved in absolutely every big thing that come out.   sjw s   heresy! burn the witch!
Im sure a non-binary james bond will bring in the money for the franchise or a strong   independent   wahman
they are doing nothing but insulting ian fleming s legacy.
women evolving as well.  itseems like we are no longer different genders but rather different species along with trans entering the chat.  and above all else children are being dragged into this is particularly disturbing.  bond is going to be mom.
the unhealthy attachment to pokemon is really starting to show in hollywood
by men evolving do we mean having a higher estrogen content  having a far weaker grip  afraid to get sweaty or dirty  cant kill a spider  need their wife to open the pickle jar   of course we re killing james bond. this is why we cant have nice things.  okay  Im ranting  go browns  steelers suck.
getting a little tired of your  and other peoples  soap boxing about  hand holding games . for example  life is strange series is great. if you want to a game to be hard  pick the harder difficulty. thats great some people want a huge challenge  more power to ya. however  some people work 10 hr shifts for a week straight and have had enough of a challenge in life. not everyone wants games to always be difficult. there is nothing wrong with a game having difficulty settings for everyone. you get no rewards in life by beating a game on hard. nothing. you dont get a cookie because you got top in cod online  or beat halo on legendary. so  why does it matter  why get an attitude about it  how about this  let people enjoy gaming as they want to enjoy it. you enjoy it how you want to enjoy it. stop complaining about how other people enjoy their games  it doesnt effect you. horizon forbidden west was a great example of something for everyone. it had a  hand holding  setting and also a harder difficulty settings. I dont see a problem with that.
gigalike for the gaming bit.
humans are evolving  we never stop.it is a continuing process.this includes men.
thats a shame. oh well. the franchise was already over for me.
it is really good. had no idea pratt could do a serious roll like that.
it was very refreshing
starring viola davis  perhaps
good thing I never cared for the films. I agree though that they love seeing fans upset. the little mermaid is a perfect example
the mean de-evolving
woke hollywood really despises money dont they
we all saw this coming. you know they weren t going to let james bond keep being an alpha male
these new writers are just   . clueless. the new writers are activists
cant wait to get blamed for the next bond films failure lol
so make him not james bond
since men are evolving I choose to evolve into charizard
bond died with sean connery  changemymind  youcant
a more sensitive stone cold assassin. right.
I wish they would just come up with original ips instead of changing what we have grown up with
hImelonie off topic thoughts on ghost of tshuninma infamous series and sly cooper good video melonie
my dear it is not about the fans but the message and bond is a classical archetype that they want to change to bring in more weirdness and since entertainment has mass influence around the world it is used as propaganda or the mouthpiece to reach the widest audience. look what is happening in schools and see where this is going.
what s next  007 shoe-horning his pronouns in between  bond...james bond
but didn t they already screwed james bond in the previous movie
why arn t there more fight scenes in this make-up add
I didn t know that  evolving  meant becoming genderless.... weird.
no scripture  still love your videos!
james bond literally died with daniel craig.
what will happen to the wwe of this keeps up
if they did they wouldn t make enough money to claim their changes are successful.
yep!
I at least hope the next bond is henry cavill and not that page guy.
barbara broccolI should have the franchise forcibly removes from her. her dad is probably rolling in his grave right now.
lol I was just telling my friends about race swapping characters that already  exist  I do not like thatshit at all
my name is bussy.... james bussy
its a simple solution. the last james bond movie was casino royale  just like the last star wars movie was revenge of the sith. done.
just some more custumers for the  rippaverse to steal
if it isn t clear to everybody by now  we are being pushed somewhere by ideologues  in every facet of our lives...sorry for the downer
they not only race swap but change sexual orientation of characters.
now Im pissed.
james bond died when shawn connery died
the first three jb movies are the only ones worth mentioning.
its like if I like dancing but I need to play baseballwoke  we need to change it when the player run they need to dance and not run cause disabled peoplewoke  hitting the ball with a bat is 1000  violence acceptingwoke  why only guys are there we also want womenpeople  but how ...what would they do now  how we play it then woke  idk...you dont wanna be racist so dance maybe do a baseball dance-off or something ... this game is stupid Im going to dance now
I remember james bond used to slap women
men are evolving.  does this mean james bond will turn mgtow and avoid women
the sooner this all stops  the better
just watch goldeneye and casino royale. those are the only two bond movies worth a damn anyway lol
evolving how creepy and dystopian is that  like their defective
I like your new profile pic.
what is to be gained here  destroying something for no good reason
I really hope daniel craig isn t the last only great 007.
I thought he was dreadful
@1pr007  who was the best to you
@flamur alaj  bond to me needs to be cool suave charismatic sophisticated womanizing with fun and escapism a guy who falls in love and resigns twice in the space of 4 movies isn t james bond to me  he was tortured for 15 years over a girl he met for a week  its just not the bond that connery made an icon brosnan moore connery dalton craig lazenby
great they destroyed 007.......... Imiss the days of goldeye and old classics like for your eyes only and thunderball. rest in peace james bond. you will be missed...
at least daniel craig did the character justice on his way out....no one wants this.
its the same crowd that has tds and dont even vote!
future headline   new bond film flops and sinks franchise
james bond was a standard male power fantasy  that is now turning into homer simpson with a gun fantasy. wtf is wrong with society lately  oh wait... money
sounds like the libertarian -  non-aggression principle
I guess this is becoming a trend nowadays. james bond is no more. glad I saw the last movie before I care about the next one because I know I wont care about it.
melonie you should watch terminal list its a mix of jason bourne and punisher 2004 with thomas jane
thank you lady
you are smart girl.
they do this to create controversy. get a lot of attention. people will watch to join the conversation.terrible movie ends up getting more sales. dont give them your money.
wait I thought you were on a road trip
they forgot the d.  men are devolving .
irks me so much  they ruined 50 years of tradition. a father-son movie franchise for generations.
seeing u like tomb raider so much what are your thoughts on horizon
bond died the day brosnan handed in his walther ppk   ltk.
soon everything will be beige.
no thanks. Im happy with my 007 movie collection.
why is nothing safe
isn t one of james bonds iconic characteristics that hes a bit of a womanizer and charms the ladys to get laidive never seen any of the modern versions so dunno if thats still a thing
I am  but Imade this video yesterday and scheduled it
@melonie mac go boom   but itsays today...  you fakenews us via youtube
@melonie mac go boom  jk have a good trip
make james bond slap women s butts again!
wait if Im evolving does that mean Im no longer racist because grandpa was
this looks more like a regression to me.
devolving
double woke 7
save money by not going to the movies.
james bond is about sex and guns....sensitive gonna cry when he kills someone  drink less  write poetry lmfao
james bond died long before queen. he was no longer in her service.
what does woke mean
mmmmh... this is crazy  no real bind fan wants an emotional james bond.
melanie is soooo hot.
james wussbond
whoo is tattooed on your right arm

they need to get rid of the 2 old hack producers. the end of no time to die was so depressing.
wont be surprised if they have bond get with a dude a this point instead of hot women cause woke
so does this mean that our beloved super confident  womanizing  ass kicking  austin martin driving tom ford suit wearing secret agent 007  is now going to be an un masculine prius driving simp
are you insinuating that a half black half mexicantransgender homoseksual disabled dwarf who identifies as they them cant be a james bond  is that what youre saying to me  its 2022 sweetheart get over it.  matt justus james bond 2022
I avoid watching james bond movies  starring daniel craig  Imean james bond has become so sad and miserable that you feel sorry for him and you dont want to be in his place.while classic james bond movies  I love what he does  he s a happy playboy  and women love him. he lives the best times of his life and adventures in bed not less than his adventures to eliminate the bad guys I want to be that kind of james bond. not daniel craig  james bond
huge james bond fan to me the franchise ended when they killed off daniel craig s bond  and Im done.
their replacements would probably be worse.
@omar scarborough  maybe but I think they ve lost it.
it ended after brosnan handed in his walther and ltk
I wont even watch no time to die. only watch ones prior. hollywood can make their dumpster fires  and we can all laugh at it. right amazon  how is rings of power going for ya
@melonie mac go boom
I didn t watch 007 no time to die because of wokeness and wont watch the future 007 movies for wanting to be even more woke than that one. no time to die lost millions in its theatrical release and they clearly did not learn their lesson because they are doubling down by doing this woke crap again. its a shame because I love 007 and have been watching itsince I was a kid. Im getting extremely sick and tired of watching all the franchises I love get destroyed by activists. we should have gate kept the things we loved instead of letting these activists join in.
james bond isnt made for the guys  women love bond more than anyone fact
the downfall of bond started with casting daniel craig. since then they insisted on making bond more realistic and relatable. no thanks
bond   she hulk   wakanda eternal or whatever   thanos   she thor   the list goes on movies are dying!
marshmelonie.  cause she sweet.
tomb raider @1 29
evolving
its evolving. just backwards.
boom-chakalaka!
I love you.
so women a trojan horse in gaming
mobile gaming isnt gaming its casino slots.
I liked fresh
we are men  not pokemon  those weirdos!
how many people watched the last one  of course they re going to change something  otherwise its a dead franchise.
is there a market for a woke secret agent
wont be watching anymore bond  last one was a disgrace and how cantheir even be another one when they killed him  wtf
same
every hetero woman wants a man. not a piece of tissue paper.
bond died... and is staying dead.
look at the new battle toads  jeff  was a  person who knew them cant tell the dark queen how to dress my name is jeff... I hate the art style and now you insulted me directly.... why should I buy your product. not a fanboy for a console but a realist of a fan
I like every james bond actor. even george lazenby. he s pretty good. but daniel craig- no. not even casino royale
yep figured  james bond died in no time to die and he ain t returning... so they get someone who drinks soy milk instead.
men aren t evolving they are devolving. huge difference.
jist like gta its meant for the guys and the playerbase will always consist of dudes majority.
they ve been bad since casino royale tho
those activist females who got into gaming..ruined it for women who enjoyed games! they have scared all the men and changed everything good about gaming
well Im good thanks. not gonna evolve for the rest of my life.
thats why I stopped watching new american cinema! Im done with hollywood.the us movie industry ridiculed itself  not only that us movie makers go to china to make movies ... no they import these american movies back to the us and give themselfs an oskar for best foreign language film -   crouching tiger  hidden dragon . they repeat and repeat and repeat themselfs and are so obsessed with their own products because they spend millions and billions of   on them while south korea and japan are doing ten times more innovative movies and series for a fraction of the money.just recently I was plesantly surprised by the south korean series  vincenco . phenomenal actors  general great production value  a funny story  some surprising plot twists and a great pay of. last year I was rewatching kinjI fukasakus  yakuza papers  from the 1970s and it made all us crime thriller look like a rap videos. and legendary stop-motion artist jirI barta made two incredibly beautiful movies that dont just put disney to shame but obliterates the studio.  no thanks  Im done with hollywood.
james bond is dead   he died on a high note  he saved the world  his wife and daughter   broccolI will not bring him backthe world is changing have faith  for the better not the woke
waiting for the day when the next bond girl is a trans bond girl.
smart and pretty
wokeness is putting iconic movies to their grave. and for woke activist its a big victory by destroying those movies
ian fleming wrote the james bond character a particular way and thats the bottom line. changing it is just bs make your own heroes for females if you feel the need to have one. I will not watch and if real bond fans do the same we will show them that all they are doing is wasting money.
7 57 did this girl really just make the argument that women cant think for themselves so they had to make games easier and increase user friendliness to make it more welcoming for women  Jesus Christ  this b.
they really think man are turning in to woman so woman will never have a say.... that the message in the undertune!!
not really only a guy thing  my mum loved bond-movies  handsome man  well dressed in any situation  knows to behave and allways knowing what to do...of course only if you go with the real bond movies and not with this craig-abominations called bond the last 20 years...Imean I really dont know how this pub-brawler has got this role of an english gentleman...
this is just another example of fanbaiting.
evolution  the theory that with slapdash movements  dumb luck  and endless time  even crud can give birth to multilevel  complex  organic beauty.well three out of four ingredients is pretty close  I ll give them that much.
when know one goes and watches it they will just use the racist card
why Im turning towards movie and series made in countries who are not english spoken ones the western countries now are too woke and I cant take it anymore.
the last james bond movie   no time to die  had lashana lynch  a black girl  as james bond !!! ...  she looked like wesley snipes ...  the next james bond movie   bond   will have idris elba  a black actor  as james bond ! ... aparently is a woke movie  as well !!! ...
the next bond has to be gay. and black. and asian. and doesnt use guns. and doesnt kill. and is vegan. and cries.rotten tomatoes  98 worldwide box office  347  perfection.
white  black  red  yellow  male  female  trans a great character is a great character no matter their background.
I cant stand james bond  and never considered him a role model  so I dont watch the movies. I think this should be the approach people that dont like the character and his lore should take.
doesnt matter their agenda  but its sloppy and that what s frustrating.
I like old james bond movies but today james bond is so boring. sean connery and roger moore are the only james bonds.
daniel craig ruined the franchise. I haven t seen any bond film after his comments about a gay love interest for bond in a sequel.
oh my goodness. can we stop. he s an assassin  a man for hire.  I dont wanna shoot you  but I will if I have to   give me a break. they already was  sexist  by making the statement that the new movie will have a bigger role for woman and a more sensitive 007. isn t that a stereotype
spiderman did it the right way. spider-verse. they made a black kid get bit by a spider. they didnt ruin spiderman by replacing him with a black guy. they didnt have to ruin luke skywalker   lara croft. make another story   fighter and dont make the hero a totally different person. they might be trolling but they might just be horrible writers.
oh God here we go. and you already know what s going to happen. the new movie is gonna flop and their gonna blame the audience for being misogynistic  racist  etc  you know  the usual buzzword terms they use.
women traditionally dont watch bond films. men watch bond films because its an archetype they wish they could be. turning bond into a soy-boy appeals to no one. did they not see top gun  maverick and look at the box office draw   f  em. let it die like everything else they ve killed.
Im black and I hate race swapping. I grew up in the hood and I saw the little mermaid and it was great. now I see a black one it doesnt make sense just make something new. if they make conan any color than white I just give up my childhood rodded.
gamers  what gamers  did you not hear what nvidia priced there new gpus at  also no computer case is going to fit a 4090 nor have the power supply to power it. good thing you went all amd.
men women are evolving! translation  men are being turned into discount women and vice versa.
another victim of the normies.
movies and shows constantly pander to the whole  girl boss  strong female  man hating  agenda and tell us  it wasn t made for you!!! james bond is a franchise for men. we ve lost marvel. we ve lost gaming. we ve lost sport  so leave james bond alone and let us have it!! stop trying to take over and push gender politics in everything. we dont try and change mean girls or twilight ..
what do you think of seline kyle aka catwoman being played by zoe kravitz  I didn t like it not one bit.
you should see the back lash that women receive in competitive shooting. from men and women.
lil nas x for the next james bond
I hope they spend hundreds of millions or even billions into these garbage films. the harder they flop  the more hilarious it will be.
ok  the bond series is dead for sure.
I find it funny these types of women wants to take control of the male space world. like I remember girls didn t like gaming or do anything related to guy things and now they are all over it. heck comic books used to be for male nerds who got picked on by the popular kids and use their imagination to get over the fear of getting bullied. like the fact women are fighting on these things is just funny to me. never forget the routes of why we have these things in the first place. heck even just computers was just for boys as back then women just want to do crazy things outside and do girly things. I think the issue hear is acknowledging your supporters and without the other you cant do great things and finally but not least they try to hard as thats what my  female cousin said  to please people.
people wouldn t want madea to all of a sudden be white  they wouldn t want black panther to all of a sudden be white..     so  why make ariel black ! ! she s a white girl with red hair  thats how walt disney envisioned her  I think people just want a piece of the pie when it comes to disney
go woke go broke.  bond rip.
james bond is all about a guy who is a women slayer sex magnet saveing the world . its the intire spirit of ever james bond movie . who tf woud watch james band the hasband who crys like a little baby and gets dominated by his marry sue partner aka karen women.
in the next movie james bond will be a black mermaid.dont question it.
I dont know what men they re talking about  probably trans men.
men are evolving  gtfoh
if woke is evolution  I d rather be a chimpanzee.
too bad youtube would get mad if you used a  p  in the title instead of a  w . james bond is basically dead now. ian fleming would be rolling in his grave.
if you change bond  he dies. he s like superman. you cant change either  only the world around them. bond is what every man wants to be  and who every woman wants to be with  this is why his story is timeless. so what the fuck needs changing  the world around us and him  not vice-versa!
another franchise sacrificed to the woke altar. good bye mr. bond.
its good thing that they killed james bond before feminising him
you mean women didn t have a significant part in bond movies already
I have not watched james bond since peirce brosnan. so oh well  what a pity  never mind  it already sucked.
omg  omg omg omg! yes. I hate weak  oversitive male  superheros   I know 007 is not one but you get it right   james bond is suppose to be strong  sexy  flirty  bulletproof and have diferent lady on the arm in every movie  insert screams from incel women . this the essence of james bond.and about other superheros. I dont want crying batman. I want batman that kick ass. I want superman saving whole planet without single drop of sweat. this is not romantic comedy or drama. this is action  superhero movie.
its good james bond wont be sexist forever because its important to actually be likable and sexism isnt cool anymore mac!
the duo  producers barbara broccolI and michael g. wilson  formed a strong bond with craig  and together evolved the character over the course of four more films  including  quantum of solace   2008    skyfall   2012    spectre   2015  and last year s pandemic-delayed  no time to die   before craig bowed out as 007.  craig  she adds   cracked bond open emotionally   bringing audiences into the character s inner life.  the films over his tenure were the first time we really connected the emotional arc. excerpts from the article nobody read.
antI sjw pick me content
except masculinity is devolving  not evolving.
dont worry. we still have the old movies. we dont have to watch this garbage
welp  james bond is done for. dont mind bigger roles for women but a more sensitive bond  we dont need a bond for a modern era.
pretty hot tomboy. so james bond wont be jes bond instead of seducing the ladies with his charming swauve persona. he s gonna have a blue pixie cut and sympathize with feminist lol. fuck me.
all they did was make sure nobody likes 007. not men  not women  not straight  not gay  no one. another murdered franchise.
evolving into what  women
anyone else starting to get a little sick of kohl and messy hair
sigh this is bad. we need more action films with a man  being a man.
this move is going to work at all  because they just to make him more soy and a crybaby whining fuck  its just so fucking stupid that hollywood thinks that james bond is a toxic man and is too heroic and they want to take and change it to fit their woke narrative instead of telling good stories with this character  its going to fail! and I wont feel bad for them at all because they will lose money and they will deserve it  because people are so fucking tired of this!
aughhhhh comment for the algorithm.
the only way to keep everyone happy is to hire a trans black woman. no one can argue with that.
men aren t evolving. we are getting tired of the bull. I dont want a sensitive james bond. I want a james bond who knows how to act cool when he kills bad guys and beds the women. the only roll for women in james bond is to be in distress and undressed in bed. thats what we want.
I really dont know why you would mess with a winning formula. the best thing about bond movies is that it is always the same theme throughout time. so f   ing lame dude.
good  I hope men keep  evolving  so that there s more access to women for us tall  high earning neanderthals.
saying  woman will have bigger roles in james bond  is like saying  the audience will have more to say in a formula 1 race  does it make any sense at all
they martyred daniel craig in the last one while not before giving his 007 status to the new bond for her to give it back when he comes out of retirement and save the day . chicks make better spy s anyway . lol
young lady  if I knew your full name I would say it. lol. where did your reading of verses and going indepth to explain them  I would think after having a nephew to help raise  scripture would be more important to you. I am sure you understand what Imean by help raise  you have alot of influence on him. would you not want him to look at your videos later in his life  and be so happy his aunt was not ashamed to share scripture like she once did  just saying.
men are not devolving it is propaganda we like gazoline pretty ladies and good movies still. go figure out why you dont sell any tickets. doh!
men who become weak  complying  cowards aka beta males  this not evolving  its degeneration.bah  craig never was a real bond anyway  all his movies sucks compared to connery to brosnan  even niven was a better bond craig will ever be.stick to the classics  forget about the modern woke era.
my nephew doesnt watch my youtube videos  and nothing is stopping me from having Bible studies with him lolI am not ashamed of scripture  you will see me talk about it daily across my social media and on twitch. I cant do Bible studies in every single youtube video  it doubles the video length and also it is a big responsibility to be interpreting scripture to people which I do not take lightly and would not want to rush just for the sake of it in every video
gay!!!
why so mad and it like you hate women  every video you make is always negative.
btw  Im old  48  and your memory is wrong. when fantastic four came out there was ridicule from both critics and the internet about alba. they didn t accept her  not the voices heard. they trashed her all over the place for being alba  bot for the actual performance. it was long before the movie was even out that fanboys ripped into her casting  same as they do today. and the movie then bombed. shame. I thought it was good and I liked alba in it.  but the overall public opinion was that it was a dumb movie and why didn t they hire a white chick for sue. race did come up. race came up way more than talking about the actual movie.  I think youre looking to the past with rose colored glasses.
