I always thought it would have been cool to do a predator movie set in ancient viking times  with a band of warriors in old norse country taking on a predator  with the implication at the end that this was the basis for the grendel legend. anybody else have any predator ideas theyve always wanted to see
I loved the fact thatshe didn t know how to kill him in the begginig and thought the film she started to notice things and started to figure out with help how to get a decent advantage against him
the  glory kill  reminds me of the wolf that young leonidas killed in 300. it adds something to the character to face a larger version of a similar challenge from the past. its a way of setting up the possibility of growth for the character
you nailed it. pretty much felt the same way. pretty good  but could ve used way more character development.
good flick refreshing prequel with a strong character staying true to her abilities to being a hunter.
keep sharing  reviewing  and rating and talking about sequels so we can get more to this story and eventually work up to more deadly predators. let s go for the ride and see how they follow up. good movie with prey! now let s keep it going guys
have you seen outlander  with the guy from frequency  its a movie set in norway with an exosolar human ship crash landing and unleashing a xenomorph like creature. a sort of spacely version of beowulf essentially. you d probably like it I think. edit  oh  and there s also outland with one of the bond actors which was pretty good as well.
I am really interested in your opinion on this movie. before I do I thought id say this movie had some good scenes  but wonder what could have been if not  woke   trapper scene   . wow. I like your take better  I knew the script was bad    character development week  but I thought my problem was the forced a female lead  in a time  place  and situation that was too much  culminating with the weak ending. but I like your pov of just giving her a better arch! would have helped!
its too bad they never made a predator movie based on the early dark horse comics where it follows dutch  brother who is a police officer. there were a lot of early dark horse comics that were set up as sequels for predator and alien that were criminally ignored. even their 1st avp 5 part series was freaking awesome.
the fur trappers had a big purpose aside from the gun and kill targets. they ware down the creature some. it made the creature look more resilient and believable that after all the shit that was thrown at him  he falled down in the end.
predator s design was really cool!
she got the entire hunting party killed just because she ran off in a huff and they had to go looking for her. she felt no loss towards them or her brother falling to the predator.  her big smile at the end because she got what she wanted made her look and feel one dimensional . .. I wanted her to see and feel compassion and loss in her arc but writers now see that has weakness when writing strong female lead  characters... put it this way would the brother bring his sister s body home or predator head based off his character arc.
glad the dog survived.hero dog.
just heard you on colin moriarty s podcast and it was a great interview! glad you can be yourself and voice your true opinions  subscribed!
appreciate the honest  unbiased assessment. will give this one a shot with expectations in check
I think its important to note that there were several points in the film in which the protagonist being a woman  and perceived not to be a threat  literally saved her life. and she would have been absolute toast if her brother hadn t fought the predator first.also  I have a personal theory that the reason the predator seemed off his game had more primitive technology was because he was undertaking a similar trial as the protagonist  and was attempting to demonstrate to his peers that he was a capable hunter  which I thought was an interesting parallel.
I thought the last fight was short in the prep scene and the fight itself. I wish it had been longer.personally  I thought the brothers fight scene with the predator was pretty legit and better for the short time it lasted.
I had no expectations for prey but I really liked this film
I agree with most of these points  regardless the predator in the movie made the movie. he was freakin badass. the bear scene was dope. I think the predator is more of the main character than the girl.
great review! I appreciated how in depth you went with everything. I think I ll just skim through this one. edit  Imean skim through this movie  not this review.
I remember someone on a you tube channel a while back wanted to see a movie where a group of predators hunted the graboids of the tremors series. that woulda been cool.
almost like the vikings who went to fight mystery attackers in the 13th warrior.
this would be epic.
predator vs batman
@knights edge  nope. they d make it batgirl against predator.
commander shepard versus predatorkiryu kazuma and the tojo clan versus predatorlara croft versus predator
that has kinda been made outlander  2008 . when a spacecraft crashes in norway during the iron age  two figures emerge from the wreckage  kainan  james caviezel   an alien soldier  and the moorwen  his mortal enemy. the latter immediately starts cutting a path of destruction through the norse lands.
or how about predator in the time of Jesus. imagine....predator vs Jesus
yeah when they came out and said  the first hunt  I was like nooo there s so many more historical opportunities whyyyy
and she almost had that moment too. her brother confessed to her that the plan worked and she seriously wounded the lion. she almost got the kill and he took all the credit.
so you mean like one of these vikings would be beowulf  if yes then yeah that could be pretty cool
@mike maoudj  yes  thats it exactly
good idea. I d rather see a predator in feudal japan though  there are so many monster and demon stories in japanese folklore  one of them could easily be tied to a predator.
I would like to see a live version of the aliens vs predator comic from the 90s.
@knights edge  there was actually a colab between dc and dark horse comics back in the day in regards to batman encountering the predator and it was pretty good. highly recommend reading through it.
@armando torres  why would the predator be drawn to a non-violent itinerant preacher  wouldn t he be more interested in the roman campaigns in continental europe  or perhaps what was going on in india and china
@armando torres  predator will be reading Bible verses like melonie mac.
@knights edge  predator vs batman exists  and its actually an amazing comic series. alfred shoots a predator with a blunderbuss at one point.
@nutty_bara  yes! I was about to mention outlander. that film escaped my attention initially. but when I finally watched it  it was pretty good! long story short without spoiling too much  an alien spacecraft landed in viking lands  and fun  and gore  happens.
predator vs roman legion predator vs spartans predator vs european knight predator vs pirates predator vs samuraI and or ninja
I have an idea about well not ancient but like 20  years ago in late 90s-early-mid 00s set in a abandon castle in a land far away sacramento. nu metal edgy angry kids together with bands they re going concert to fights predators! imagine that! it will use heavy portion of  oh wa a a a ah  sound effect like every time someone punching stuff  oh wa a a a ah  sum angry douchebag who like to bully their classmates actin predator as if its a nerd who needs sum beating cuz he s angry his parents wouldn t buy him jeep and dirt bike so he chase that predator with baseball bat  oh wa a a a ah  oh and they will use guitar as makeshift axe and  wallet chain   or necklace  as a whip too!
sweat idea write a script maybe someone would buy it better hurry idea on youtube...I d watch it
but in the first movie the chick says the predator would show up when the weather got really hot. I dont remember the second movie as well but I think it was because there was a heatwave in l.a.
check out a book called  if it bleeds  its a collection of short stories involving the predator. one of the stories involves vikings
love that concept!
@david low  that is also a cool concept!
I agree! through  I dont know... may be too much whiteness lol.
I want to see a predator against a t-rex but predator would have to be really primitive with no advanced tech like plasma casters and such. could be cool if done right
vikings vs predator or samurais verus predator. these are the ones I want to see a predator go against.
samuraI s or knights. it would really interesting to see what they do with insanely primative  ranged weapons. I would love for prey to start a series or trilogy that is set in past civilizations.
I wanna see predtaor visit middle east
@armando torres  could be how they came up with  devil
@metonicus  thats what they shoulda done from the beginning
@isacc tavares  I want them to vist austrlia
thatsounds fucking amazing ! you should be a screenwriter bro !
@independent aquaman  are you one of the people who is butt hurt that main character in the 5th movie is a woman
@dg  when they say the first hunt I dont get it here s the reason go back to the avp where they went to antarctica and found that mayan temple under the ice which clearly shows that the predators where on earth for even longer hunting xenomorphs not humans and the ancient mayans in avp seemed to have worshiped the predators. you see where Im confused because according to avp the predators have been around since before they new about the native tribes of america. than you have predators which shows a planet mainly for hunting different species and on that planet you tend to see weapons from cultures on earth dating possibly further back so its just strange that they would say its the first hunt when the predators have been around in the movie ofcourse before they new about the native tribe s of america.
@knights edge  didnt they do that on deathbattle or comicbook beatdown
predator vs chris hansen
I hope you feel that way about the first predator...
@mic eatah  I suppose  outlander did take its time setting things up. and fire should have worked  but hey its the nature of stories to build up impossible enemies to defeat.
outlander was one of those good movies thatslipped through the cracks. I think it was one of those situations were an executive position changes hands and the new boss quietly pushes the old boss s projects out the door with no promotion. idiocracy was one of those  nobody knew it existed until they discovered it at blockbuster. one detail I loved in outlander is when he first lands on earth  he reads up on earth from his computer.  earth is listed as an  abandoned seed colony.  so he s from another human civilization that just planted humans on earth and noped out. such a cool detail and its only on screen for like 2 seconds.
frequency is such a good movie.
yeah  those comics rocked. its a shame they only lived on the page  never making it to the screen.
concrete jungle is basically the second movie.
you do know dark horse comics are non cannon now since disney bought the right to them.
@the one  oh yeah  forget it now. Imeant its a shame no one adapted those stories decades ago. hell  I wouldn t trust disney not to turn the alien franchise into an allegory about abortion and trans rights. these fuckers are disgusting.
@jeffrey mercado  disney needs to be stopped
new predator comic from disney have a african american girl as the main character named theta. she will hunt the predators and the predators will be the hunted. see what disney does
@the one  thats why Ive practically boycotted them. I haven t watched anything associated with disney since endgame. except for prey of course. I just cant look past the bullshit they ve been spewing on and off screen.
felt like she was the main villian
agree  she could have at least reflected back and showed getting what you want sometimes comes at a steep price. was it really worth it  would you trade in that kill for your brother and others back . but as you noted  the woke writers were probably going for  they got what they deserved for not respecting her as a hunter from birth
the tribe seemed unbothered when she threw predator head in front of them   a sane person will say wtf is that  bad direction .
@garry s  oh ffs it was the end of the movie. did they sit down with dutch for a full briefing before getting into the chopper the indians live in a world of legends and monsters. she saw the space craft and thought it was a thunderbird  she saw the predator and thought it was one of their monsters. the braves when they fought it  thought they were fighting something from their stories.
just say you dont know how to critique film and save everyone the trouble of reading your paragraphs
thank you so much!
basically  the predator in that earth timeline of the old west 1700s wasn t fully evolved. kinda like a first second dinosaur to hunt but little iq too.
@rampaiger ren  the only problem with that is that its difficult to believe they have interstellar travel  but dont have the tech from the original film.
@darthmerlin  yes they did
@khayree  the targeting device  sure  but not the plasma cannon.  he fired metal bolts instead.
it was meant to be a  youth  predator right dont they only get their plasmacaster when they re adults
@theworkmonkey1  Im not really an expert on predator lore  but that would make sense to me.
@darthmerlin  Im not an expert either but I have it in my head somewhere that they dont get the plasmacaster until they ve finished training or become an adult or something. I thought it odd that this predator was killing things like snakes and dogs until we saw it was working up to bears  and then humans. it felt like it was meant to be practicing  or learning so my assumption is its meant to be a youth  so its lack of experience put it on a more even footing against primitive tech humans.
@theworkmonkey1  yeah  I was basically thinking the same thing when I watched it.
@theworkmonkey1  yeah thats my hunch of it.
this would have made sense except the predator seemed to kill anyone regardless of threat level. think about the dude that gave her the pistol. he had his leg cut off  was playing dead and the predator still killed him. there seemed to be a lot of french people who died that weren t really a threat.
@imperial walker  my assumption is that he had already determined that entire group to be a threat.  they wiped out and skinned an entire herd of buffalo  and then they tried to trap him.
@darthmerlin  perhaps Imisread the character  but predators motivation was to hunt the best trophy  not kill things that were a threat. it is why they take skulls and display them. they are big game hunters basically. big game hunters dont kill things based on threat level  they kill things based on the challenge prestige of it. in the original predator it didn t kill everyone because they were a threat to it. it killed them because it was trying to hunt the best trophy. that turned out to be dutch. it is also why in predator 2  they gave the protagonist the pistol because they respected that he was the better hunter. in prey  the predator seems to swing wildly in its motivation and character. itseems to go from being a mindless killing machine like a horror creature  to hunter  to bumbling moron that forgets how to fight or use its weapons. it isn t really all that terrifying or interesting because it feels more like a monster of the week than a fleshed out character with clear motivations and consistent character traits.
@imperial walker  which is why I imagined that this is  like naru  an inexperienced hunter who is trying to prove himself.  the other inconsistencies you mentioned I would chalk up to bad writing.
what primitive technology  only the plasma caster was missing. and from what I can see  those guided metal arrows seems to be equaly awesome  since they can do 180  to hit where its aiming with the helmet  and its silent  so it wont spot the location like the loud plasma caster from the other movies.
@theworkmonkey1  this is the predators first time on earth  he s going up the food chain. snake kills rat  predator kills snake. wolf kill rabbit  predator kills wolf. giant vicious bear kills deer and chases girl  predator kills bear.
@theworkmonkey1  the predator in this movie is unblooded  that is why it watches the food chain and kills the top predator  and takes those trophies.  it is starting its path.  if it had survived  it would become a young blood  and train with blooded yautja.  it would then be ready to take on an xenomorph  and if it kills it the young blood becomes blooded  and can use the plasmacaster.  the reason the end credits show ship coming down is because the unblooded was being watched by its clan leader and blooded yautja.  could be a set up for how the yautja came to possess that pistol.  the one that will be given to danny glover in predator 2 about 280 years later.
@theworkmonkey1   they get their plasma caster after they become blooded I believe  after their first xeno kill.
@imperial walker  the predator couldn t see the guy that was playing dead. naru gave him the brew that hid his body heat. predator killed him because he startled the predator after he stepped on the guy they were all still active threats. especially since this predator seemed inexperienced.
@brayzen  startled the predator... so  what youre basically saying is that this predator is a complete and total idiot that ultimately killed himself so naru s accomplishment is basically not worth anything.
oh man the doggie looks so cute! Im kind of keen to watch it! I like the concept of the movie
personally  Ivery much enjoyed watching  prey  and I wish it had been shown on the big screen.
I seen it  for me movie was very good  loved it
it was better than expected. itslightly dropped the ball  but still was better than expected. I was expecting uber wokeness like typical of movies and shows taking on ips with massive longstanding fandoms...like they want to piss off the ones who kept those ips alive all those decades like say star wars or he man..6.5 10 is my vote.
what Im getting from melonie is she into monster looking guys
I liked the movie and I hear people complain about her being able to kill the predator but throughout the whole movie he s getting hurt and injured and the brother was kicking his ass until he went invisible so she never fought him at 100  and at the beginning itshows her training atleast not like in star wars
youre great melonie.  keep up the good work!
its like clan of the cave bear meets predator.
yeah I share some of the same opinions however I am more judgemental when it comes to the action  maybe because I am not a huge pure action fan and maybe the flashy style has been done to death nowadays  where everyone almost defies gravity. were you expecting to see the predator and people in the movie play out some heavily orchestrated dance of death  see the predator become geralt of rivia and do pirouettes and backflips and look cool for the camera as he kills  then this is the movie for you. I was expecting something more grounded in reality. try imagining if the first movie was done in 2022  arnie would slide across the ground  do backflips and be dodging the predator like a ninja..
should she have been the one to kill the wolf  if she did it right after it killed the hare it would have played off the owl from earlier in the movie  wait and do less work. might make sense with her using the mud pit at the end. she s not a typical hunter but she ll put herself in the most advantageous position and make her own good luck
I thought it was alright. I could pick holes in quite a lot of it  like the jump from killing a couple of rabbits to being able to take down a predator lol... but overall  it was ok. I didn t feel lectured and there was some good action. I think they are lucky that films get bonus points just for not ramming woke garbage down our throats at the moment.
just once could they let the predator win and not die at the end
I liked the movie  I think there were parts in it that didn t make the most amount of sense. I think the trailer was received as more  girl power  or mary sue type writing. surprisingly it wasn t as bad as I was expecting. so I enjoyed the movie overall  I had things I didn t like but hey thats movies.
yo! you look more like lara croft than alot of the more modern portrayals right about now
let it go ahead and be a predator movie.
great review melonie
there is one part I think people forget or didn t think of....this predator was dropped and left by his ship. this could have been his initiation like he s still new to hunting. like the pred from part 1 would have never been bit by a wolf. he was the hunter. I saw this one as training and why he didn t make the best decisions. just my thoughts  I could be wrong but thats how I can only see the justification of a 90lb girl winning this fight.
the gun was a call back to predator 2 ending
good review. I found prey aggressively  meh  but not terrible. action was pretty fun though I did get annoyed at terrible animal cgI and lack of grounding in actual physics  apparently putting a string on your tomahawk makes it return to you like mjolnir . I could get over some of the anachronistic speech patterns but why did no-one hold their bows correctly  this is archery 101. actors were bland with very little character development. the dog gave the most expressive and nuanced performance. still  it had some fun moments and was not as bad as it could have been.
did you miss the part where she was taught by the french guy how to operate the gun!
like me
yeah plus she even missed the low tree entangled branches several times when she got stuck in a deep mud hole despite she trained with the roped tomahawk in the woods with accuracy.
if thats the case  dutch didn t fight the jungle predator at 100 . yet he still got destroyed because he was physically outmatched..
@khayree  its not the same but sure this new predator got beat way more the french shot stabbed him and he stepped on a trap a wolf bit him the indians messed him up the bear almost killed him the brother almost killed him not the same
@andres garcia  even if that was the case itshowed absolutely no form of being weighed down by its past injuries.
what training  tying a rope to an axe and becomes kratos  then after that itshows shes carrying rabbits on her shoulder. no character development whatsoever.
@the one  at the beginning itshows her throwing her axe like she s done it before even the mom mentions it about the dad made it to cut bread or something and she does say she wants to be a hunter and atleast it wasn t a starwars rey situation where she became over powered because reasons
@andres garcia  naru did became overpowered at the end fight just like rey. woke gone broke.
@the one  I dont think so like I said the predator was got his ass beat up and was injured before there fight
@andres garcia  it felt forced because half ot the movie is showing her constantly fail at hunting a deer  a lion  a bear  she got totally scared of the bear  but total badass towards the invisible humanoid creature twice her size. throwing axe on a tree is different from on a moving target.
@rafael santos  I do get your point but I do believe it was a good movie and I would agree if she would have taken him on without him being injured but it wasn t like she fought it hand to hand like arnold
@andres garcia  the way she killed the predator  they made her fighting iq higher than the predator and everyone else in the movie. simply put  how do you go from killing a grizzly bear with your bare hands  to getting killed by a woman who is 115lbs soaken wet how did rey go from knowing nothing about the force  to killing a sith Lord.its called identity politics.woke girl magic
@the one  she made the rope  tied it to the axe  practiced with it until she was comfortable with it  then went hunting with it. seems a logical progression.
@rafael santos  you mean like rocky  or the heroes of thousands of other movies  where he losses the first fight then has to train hard to finally win the last fight  how dare that happen to a woman.
@alfred stimoli  she trained for like 2 days with the rope axe and becomes a ninja. she was like hanzo in the mortal kombat movie. if it was a male protagonist would ve been the same problem.
@andres garcia  its not a bad movie by any means  but still very problematic towards the end third. but the bar from the sequels are so low  this one is over praised. I hope they do a better job in the next.
@dr. manhattan  you clearly are not thinking about how this predator works. he is clearly primal compared to other predators and used brute strength rather than gadgets until he was very out matched and even then he left his weapons behind and was not very good at using his fucking tracking gun to hit a moving target. naru simply seen how he was inexperienced and how he was clearly more of a muscle head. she used his advantages against him
@alfred stimoli  logical for anyone that hasn t practiced shit in their life...
@divin3 nightmar3  another person with a brain   could be
@rafael santos    if it was a male protagonist would ve been the same problem. no  no it wouldn t. had it been a male none of you would be saying shit.
she did.
telling someone how to operate a gun and actually operating a gun are waaaay different things. thats something you get a feel for with experience  which is why most gun owners frequent the range.
@melonie mac go boom  snipboard.io b3rwze.jpgcome on melonie  does she really need gun experience and a gun range to hit a 6-7 foot alien close-range with a flintlock pistol it feels unfair.
also she didn t fully know how too operate it  hence why it didn t fire the first time she tried  she didn t put enough powder  she was using the guess  check  and pray method
@make_room_4daddy  agreed.
naru already knew how to operate guns since she is from the 20th century. just look at the way she talks  its like the people you see in high school these days. no suprise at all thatshe knew how it works.
he wouldn t interested in fighting her until the end because he didn t see her as a threat or sport and she finally figured that out and went mid evil on him. I think anyway I ll have tI go back and watch again to be sure.
I agree. the main character wasn t as much of a mary sue as I thought she d be  but the  chip on her shoulder  was annoying. the ending would ve been better if she and her brother together took down the predator. still  the movie was solid. nowhere near as good as the original  but maybe on par with predators and or predator 2. definitely the best sequel we ve had in a long time!
prey  was dope
everyone saved her including the predator! she witnessed the predator fight and kill a grizzly bear with its bare hands. on top of that  he was surgical at killing everyone else. but when it came to her  he goofed more than once  leading to his death. made no sense.
I prey for more!
it was freaking awesome
I found it weird that when  raphael give her gun instructions he forgot to mention  pull trigger . maybe its in the dubbed version but in english he doesnt  say the best part. she basically  had to guess.
Ive never seen pray but I did see a movie called bone tomahawk and boy let me tell you that movie was good!!!!
very good and balanced review  I agree with your points 95 ... wokeness is a little more present than you noticed  but the rest is on point...I also liked a lot how they portraied the predator  in a super primal and  animalistic  way...
good movie
in reality they should make a couch potato a predator hunter.
Imiss kevin peter hall.  think about thatscene from the first film where the predator was head and shoulders taller than arnold.  this thing was a monster.  the weakest part of predators was they were all human size.  I cant tell what they re doing in prey about the predator size  but overall the movie looks like a case of mediocre memberries.
hmm I really enjoyed the movie  I get the story we re she thinks people dont believe in her I imagine back then it was possibly like that but I thought they did a great job to tie in the pistol to predator 2
watched the whole thing in comanche with subtitiles it was amazing and immersive. I hope melonie followed cultural appropriating and watched it in comanche
Imean in reality it would have been the brother who killed the predator lol. so yes it was trying to be woke a bit.
protagonist  character arcstart of film Im a good hunter and deserve your respect! end of film see  told you I was awesome so endearing
the problem I had with this movie was that there weren t any men in the tribe...except the old man handing the stick to the  war chief  ..those guys who were there were more like teenagers of the tribe  I guess the real men were on a hunt or war party somewhere. actually native woman back then were tough and I could have believed this premise if they said the actual men were gone somewhere. it just seemed stupid that those guys were supposed to represent the  men  of the tribe
its a very good movie
the frenchman with the severed leg  and the only one that could talk to her  explained how the gun worked and itstill took her three tries to get it to fire.Im also glad thatshe was standing directly behind the predator when she finally fired it correctly. those thing only have an effective range of a little over a dozen feet.the suspension of disbelief required for the final fight is quite high  the rest was pretty good.
this movie was good
no  you are correct.
youre correct. its absolute bullshit. the movie enforced this logic that if youre the protagonist you can fight predator whenever you feel like it. this is the same predator who killed an unarmed man and finished off a leg less man. the protagonist was in situations similar to those moments yet wasn t killed .
@khayree  agreed. the predator s logic was inconsistent in this movie and changed for convenience. it didn t kill things that were a threat  it killed things that it deemed to be a challenge. that has been the staple of predator since the first movie. it kills to prove itself as a hunter by killing the strongest thing and taking the head and spine as a trophy. in prey itseems to turn into a monster of the week just randomly killing everything whether it was a threat or not. as you said  it killed the one legged frenchman for... reasons   the protagonist had so much plot armor where the predator treated her with kid gloves. it would run up and tear a human apart with its  sword hands  but suddenly decides... meh... this woman isn t worth my time even though she has a pistol in her hand she was pointing at my back  that Ive seen survive throughout this entire ordeal. plot armor!
naru is basically the main villian in the movie. the predator just wants to be her boyfriend but she always rejected him.
@khayree  yes the protagonists awlays fight the predator at the end.what bullshit are you taking about.
@imperial walker  you clearly haven  t watched the predator films.plot armor
here s so plot armor and convenience for you.poncho in the first film was injured and they had to carry him but the predator killed him anyway.he wasn t a threat to it.-  dutch fell down a waterfall  survives  then  conveniently  the mud he s rolling on makes him invisible to the predator. plot armor  -  then the predator shots multiple  plasma caster  shots at dutch when he was hiding in the trees  none of them hit. plot armor  -  then when the predator gets  dutch  it doesnt use its wrist blades to kill him  instead  it plays around with him. plot armor  -  harrigan literally encounters a predator on a rooftop  and points a gun at it but instead of killing him  it runs away. plot armor  -  then it follows  harrigan  to his meeting with  king willy  and instead of killing them both like he did the jamaicans  it lets him go. plot armor  -  it also follows  harrigan  to the grave yard  has clear shot with the plasma-caster  and lets him go. plot armor  -  let s not forget after it massacres people on the train  and takes jerry s skull  harrigan shows up with a pistol  instead of killing him right then and there it  runs away again. plot armor  ya ll just hate  naru  all this bullshit about plot armor can be argued throughout the films.how many times did the predator have a clear shot at dutch and harrigan
every predator in the franchise has saved the protagonist for last.they had multiple chances to kill them early.thats how it always worked.
@ m nlamb  in the movie prey. tell me one example of an injury the protagonist sustains that results in us believing she can be permanently hurt or killed  or that will result in increased difficulty fighting the predator.
@imperial walker   none  same as dutch  harrigan   royce.-  dutch got shot in the shoulder by a plasma caster  but recovered easily  he was using his arm just fine afterward  he was lifting logs and chucking grenade spears with it. when you watch predator  no time do you think what about his shoulder -  harrigan was hit by a car by keys man but recovered as well  he used his body just fine. when you watch predator  no time do you think what about his body -  royce was completely healthy before he fought the berserker mr. black  he has no injuries. when you watch predators  no time do you worry about royce -  naru s leg got maimed with a bear trap by the french trappers but recovered as well after using ointments. when you watch prey  no time do you worry about naru s leg wound all predator protagonists are healthy enough before they fought the predator  and none of them have any crippling injuries.they rarely get injured if you watch the films  none of them give us a reason to think they can be permanently hurt by the predator.I dont even know why you asked me this question  I am genuinely convinced the reason all these dumb things are being said is thatshe s a woman.since when does the predator protagonist go into the last battle injured to convince us they can be killed without her and the dog 2v1 the predator she would be dead.just enjoy the film  please.let me ask you this what sustained injury did all the other protagonists have that made us believe they can be permanently hurt or killed I need to know.
@ m nlamb  at 1 hour 29 minutes. dutch gets bombarded by the predator s weapon. he spits up a mouthful of blood and hobbles away clutching his side. 1 hour 36 min - dutch is beat multiple times. he is crawling stumbling away from the predator. he takes a punch to the face and blood flies out of his mouth. he gets punched and he falls down when he attempts to crawl away. he is obviously exhausted and hurt. he cant even stand up and the predator comes up behind him. after he crushes the predator he closes his eyes  exhausted. when he gets up to move  he grunts and struggles to pick up the rock. 1 hour 42 min - dutch is in the chopper and looks defeated  sad  and shocked. ...in predator 2  glover sells the idea he is exhausted. his arm appears hurt. he constantly stumbles around nearly falling over from exhaustion. 1 hour 34 min he gets slashed in the stomach which causes him to drop to his knees at the mercy of the predator. ...yes  we knew they wouldn t die  but both of these actors sold the idea that they could be injured and as the fight went on they became increasingly exhausted. the actors sold the idea that fighting a predator was a dangerous task that takes a toll. in prey  she bashes her head on a rock after a 30 foot fall  gets beat up by multiple males  falls  slips  etc. she gets her leg in a trap  body slammed  choked and knocked around by the predator  and not once do her injuries seem to slow her down. in fact she is fighting like black widow with unlimited stamina no matter who she fights. that actor didn t sell it at all that the predator was hard to beat or dangerous.and yes... being a 90 pound woman does factor in.
@imperial walker  exactly  being a 90-pound woman does factor in which is why the final battle makes sense.the dynamic of the film is  predator vs prey  which was portrayed through the wildlife and the humans  the entire film ran with this theme to the end.  naru was portrayed as  prey  throughout the film. that was her role.  predator was portrayed as a  predator  throughout the film. that was its role.the final act is supposed to flip their roles and depict  naru  as a  predator hunting its prey    that actor didn t sell it at all that the predator was hard to beat or dangerous that role belonged to the wildlife  the comanches  and the french trappers  which they sold.as depicted throughout the film its impossible  for  naru  to fight the  feral predator  at full strength.dutch  harrigan   royce fought their  predators  at full strength.this is the  only  film where the predator went into the final battle extremely injured.-  its entire tech aside from the laser-guided arrows was gone. -  it was bitten by a wolf and then got mauled by a bear.-  it was slashed and pierced by the comanches including the brother.-  it was ambushed  sneered with a trap  and shot with muskets by the french trappers.-  it was shot in the head  lost its bio-mask so it could barely see then lost an arm.during the final act  she and her dog were at the advantage. hence the movie  title   naru was portrayed as a  predator  at the end.  predator was portrayed as a  prey  at the end.it would not make sense for a 90-pound woman to fight a healthy predator and take its beatings like harrigan  dutch  and royce. if that happened like you suggested people would absolutely complain and lose their shit.its actually kinda similar to predator 2 where the  city hunter  cowardly ran for its life as  harrigan  was hunting it down  only reason it fought back was because it got cornered and assumed it would receive backup on the ship  but the elder and the others let it fight to the end.this is why enjoyed this film because it has so many tie-ins with predator 2.I was actually worried about how this film is gonna convince me that  naru  is supposed to kill the predator  especially after it displayed how ruthless and savage this predator was  especially after it killed a grizzly with a hook.but I was satisfied  she tag-teamed it with her dog and it was on its last legs.I dont mind that people dont like this film  its okay.the reason why they dont like it makes zero sense to me  especially on how they ve been happening since the inception of the first film in the  80s.this whole  plot armor   kid gloves  bullshit  as if they ve  never  watched any of the previous films.you saying it killed the one-legged man as if it  never  killed a defenseless person before.you saying itshe held a pistol at its back when it clearly couldn t see her and didn t know she was there.these things rely on the bio-mask for almost everything they are blind af  -  https   snipboard.io dcx802.jpgit could only see the trapper even the bio-mask couldn t detect her like the one-legged man  -  https   snipboard.io 3n5sce.jpgshe was silent as a ghost behind it  it was impossible for it to know she was there  -  https   snipboard.io b3rwze.jpgas a matter of fact the predator walker right past dutch when he was hugging the tree in the first film  -  snipboard.io usliia.jpgI honestly think you guys are being unfair to this film  its as if you went into it wanting it to fail miserably but because that didn t happen you are nitpicking things that have always happened in the past predator films.
@ m nlamb  what about that end statement  why dodge that part    you know  when she deliberately unarmed herself just to not engage predator  while that other guy who was unarmed was killed    or when she was caught in a bear trap and predator spared her while that one defenseless leg less guy was killed    the funny thing is that on numerous occasions she proved herself as a threat to predator even playing dirty yet he didn t kill her
@ m nlamb  so  basically is what your describing is someone who wanted to be a hunter so they go to the plains of africa and find a lion. then  they wait until every other creature has attacked it  its been shot by multiple hunters  and eventually becomes incapacitated in a mud hole. then they wait for it to kill itself  then take the head back and mount it on the wall.I understand what youre saying  but to me it is this fails to be a satisfying accomplishment because the movie never presents it that way. if the movie had setup the predator to be so strong that the only way anyone could beat it was when it was weak  that is fine. the problem again is that naru doesnt struggle to beat it. the predator becomes weak and she becomes a superhero. not once did I believe she was in any danger. the lack of injury. the unlimited stamina and intelligence. the fantastical moves like jumping out of a 50 foot tree  back flipping  etc. had the movie shown me an injured predator and a protagonist that is overcoming regardless of her injuries and her exhaustion it would have felt earned. it would have given me that   wheeew  yes!  moment. but  I never believed it. she was op and the predator was as injured as he needed to be to allow her to win. I am not being unfair to this film. I dont want it to fail at all because I love films and want to be entertained by them. what I am doing is offering what I think is valid and fair criticism. I am not allowing the race  culture or gender of the protagonist s  to dissuade me from giving what I think is fair and honest feedback. I dont see older movies as perfect and I am happy to criticize them as well  but I am flabbergasted how this movie with so many glaring flaws is being called a masterpiece. I thought the idea of predator vs. native americans would have been a nice change and after enjoying assassin s creed iiI I was ready for more cool native inspired action. this film unfortunately resorted to the same tired tropes  the same boss bitch nonsense  the same  you belong in the kitchen   I am smarter than a beaver  identity nonsense  and missed an opportunity to tell a compelling story from the native perspective with their culture and beliefs at the forefront. I dont care about some pretty superhero level girl going through the paint by numbers to kill a predator. I saw thatstory in predator 1  I dont care to see it again and done much worse.
@imperial walker     if the movie had setup the predator to be so strong that the only way anyone could beat it was when it was weak  that is fine thats literally what happened  it killed a bear with a punch for Christ sakes  the only way you belived it would be killed is if it was weakened  thats what happened!!!this predator has the highest kill count in these films.   I am not allowing the race  culture or gender of the protagonist s  to dissuade me from giving what I think is fair and honest feedback you 100  are though  since she s a woman you expect her to do less than someone like dutch  since she s from a different race you expect a documentary unlike dutch  did you want a documentary into amrican culture when they were on screen    no  you simply just watched a predator film.and I dont wanna comment on the realism or stamina with these films.dutch went from soldier to tarzan. I dont care.harrigan went from cop to elite soldier. I dont care.naru went from hunter to black widow.  I dont care.you have a problem with her jumping from a 50 foot tree  dutch fell from a waterfall and a 50-foot tree and even after all that beating he got up and outran an explosion while harrigan out ran a spaceship launch.quit the shit man  they are action heroes. stop it.this is a predator film  your expectations were unreasonable  you wanted a  native american documentary  with the same type of the depth you experience in assassins creed 3  a videogame from a 90 minute film.none of the other predator films ever delved into american culture and beliefs.an  ahsoka tano  series is in production  Im not expecting a  togruta  culture and beliefs from a  togruta s perspective  Im expecting a star wars series.yes you are unfair to this film  because the focus was on the  native americans  the wildlife and the french tarppers  not just the native americans  so expecting a  documentary  makes no sense. I am smarter than a beaver  is a line she said when speaking with her brother about the time they had a flood when they were kids  and a beaver that had its leg pinned between 2 rocks  as the water was rising and was about to drown  it chowed off its own legs to survive.so she had an idea that the jaws of the bear trap would show off the rope they were tied to  she was referencing their childhood  films have been doing this for years. youremember that time...  those have been happening for years.so what the hell are you talking about  what part of that is identity nonsense  you belong in the kitchen  is a ridiculous line used in modern day time  but that doesnt mean it never existed especially 300 years ago  thats how most cultures worked back in the day worked  she was expected to be a herbalist.I dont sit there watching 1998  mulan  listen to her father say  a women doesnt belong in the battlefield  and think identity nonsense as if that wasn t part of their culture.youreally need to stop watching  woke  and  anti-woke  channels because you will never enjoy a film.people watch predator films for what they are  not anything else  even the older films aren t perfect but they are also called  masterpieces  if youre-watch every film and nickpick every single detail  like you do  then you wont enjoy none of them because they have so many flaws.for a  predator film  its a masterpiece  but for a film in general its not  the same goes for a film like  the empire strikes back  it has flaws but its a  masterpiece  of a  star wars film and I honestly dont know why you have a problem that people like a film that you hated.this back and forth as gone on long enough.I just enjoyed a predator film  you didn t  its pretty clear that the film you were expecting is not a predator film  its a native american-inspired action  cultural documentary film with the same depths as assissins creed 3.you can just say you didn t like it  but your reasons still make not sense to me.let s agree to disagree.
@ m nlamb  you missed the second part of what I said. I dont care if it had to be weakened  but that isn t an excuse to make the protagonist a superhero.  ou 100  are though  since she s a woman you expect her to do less than someone like dutch  since she s from a different race you expect a documentary unlike dutch  did you want a documentary into amrican culture when they were on screen    no  you simply just watched a predator film. there are a lot of reasons I expect her to do less than dutch. first  she is a 90 pound woman vs. a 300 pound trained soldier with modern weapons and knowledge. I dont expect a documentary because of her race  that is an asinine assumption. however  if the movie is going to give us native americans  vs. military commandos  then yes  I expect that to play into the story somehow.  and I dont wanna comment on the realism or stamina with these films. it isn t about realism. it is about believability.  this is a predator film  your expectations were unreasonable  you wanted a  native american documentary  with the same type of the depth you experience in assassins creed 3  a videogame from a 90 minute film.none of the other predator films ever delved into american culture and beliefs. incorrect and for you to continue suggesting this is ridiculous. again  dont put native american s in a movie and not have that be a factor.  I am smarter than a beaver  is a line she said when speaking with her brother about the time they had a flood when they were kids  and a beaver that had its leg pinned between 2 rocks  as the water was rising and was about to drown  it chowed off its own legs to survive. I understand why the line was said. what you seem to be missing is the context.   you belong in the kitchen  is a ridiculous line used in modern day time  but that doesnt mean it never existed especially 300 years ago  thats how most cultures worked back in the day worked  she was expected to be a herbalist. again  you miss the context. youre surface level thinking.  youreally need to stop watching  woke  and  anti-woke  channels because you will never enjoy a film. you need to stop assuming that I am unable to form my own conclusions based on my own experiences. you need to stop assuming what I watch. people watch predator films for what they are  not anything else  even the older films aren t perfect but they are also called  masterpieces  if youre-watch every film and nickpick every single detail  like you do  then you wont enjoy none of them because they have so many flaws. you are in no position to say why anyone watches a predator film and what they should get out of it. what I enjoy or why is none of your business or concern.  t  but your reasons still make not sense to me. which is fine. not everyone looks at film with the same eyes. some  like yourself clap and smile while you eat your popcorn. others  such as myself come at them from a different perspective because of our own experiences and reasons. I am happy you enjoyed the film and you are unable to see the flaws. that is amazing for you. I personally did not and my reasons are not because of race  gender  or whatever. my reasons are because when you analyze it taking into consideration the basics of storytelling  plot   character development  vfx  dialogue  and all the factors that determine what is or isn t a great story  this movie falls squarely in mediocre territory. not bad  but certainly not good  and unfortunately falls victim to modern writing and a fear of allowing the characters to experience their full range.
@imperial walker   again  dont put native american s in a movie and not have that be a factor   damn   I feel sorry for all the native americans  they cant be in a film unless its a documentary about their culture and beliefs. I dont expect a documentary because of her race  that is an asinine assumption    I agree it is ridiculous but its not an assumption dont put native american s in a movie and not have that be a factor   thats not an assumption  its what you said  you are a contradicting yourself.   films should only put in native americans with a  factor  of them displaying their culture and beliefs. I personally did not and my reasons are not because of race  gender  or whatever    ....     gender   I expect her to do less than dutch     race   dont put native american s in a movie and not have that be a factor  first  she is a 90 pound woman vs. a 300 pound trained soldier with modern weapons and knowledge    correction  she is a 90 pound woman with her dog vs  300 pound trained soldier that lost its modern day weapons  is injured and blind  lost an arm  shot in the brain  trapped and a foot in the grave. however  if the movie is going to give us native americans  vs. military commandos    I dont think we watched the same film  you must ve mistaken this film with another.   do you know what a military commando is  and where did you see that in the film  I understand why the line was said. what you seem to be missing is the context    there is no context  not everything has a deeper meaning  is woke  or is an agenda  relax. again  you miss the context. youre surface level thinking    its surface level film treat it as such  just get your popcorn and watch the film.   people do this all the time  especially in music and films  trying to add depth to something that was never there  even directors have called it out before. it isn t about realism. it is about believability    dont look for believability either in predator film.   I dont believe yautjas  xenomorphs  kaijus  vampires  dragons etc...nothing is believable about the so why look for that in the film where they are the sole focus.   a predator can punch a grizzly to death  and easily knock a wall over  so when I watch dutch getting punched an dlsappeared by the predator Im not expecting his head to roll.  a fear of allowing the characters to experience their full range    which predator film did this  I forgot. not everyone looks at film with the same eyes    exactly so why are you so annoyed that people are calling it a masterpiece  they dont see it the same way you do  right. some  like yourself clap and smile while you eat your popcorn    yes  just like the predator franchise had intended  thats what I do.   you dont know how to watch a film for what it is. Im not expecting the Godfather like you do. you are unable to see the flaws. that is amazing for you    no need to be condescending and I do see the massive flaws but the points you mention are not them. you are in no position to say why anyone watches a predator film and what they should get out of it    youre right Im sorry   you are well in your right to expect a native american caltural documentary just like how you enjoyed your experienced with assassins creed iii. what I enjoy or why is none of your business or concern.    relax buddy  youre safe here nobody gonna hurt you. Im sorry. others  such as myself come at them from a different perspective because of our own experiences and reasons    yes   everyone who loves this film is a surface level thinker  makes no sense to you why they see it as a masterpiece  predator film  my reasons are because when you analyze it taking into consideration the basics of storytelling  plot   character development  vfx  dialogue  and all the factors that determine what is or isn t a great story  this movie falls squarely in mediocre territory    like I said you just dont know how to watch a film for what it is.   1987 predator dialogue was terrible and cringe  with lines like  cia got you pushing too many pencils   stick around   I ain t God time to bleed    do you know why people dont critique the dialogue because they simply watched and expected an  80s action film and its a masterpiece.   a film with low-budget like prey is not gonna have good vfx  so dont expect great vfx and you will enjoy the film.   dont expect great character development in a 90-minute monster fic  in the first film only  dutch and mac  had any arc or development  just like  naru and taabe  isn t a great story  this movie falls squarely in mediocre territory. not bad  but certainly not good  and unfortunately falls victim to modern writing    fair enough.   its unfortunate that the film  couldn t meet your  expectations  but its cool.   hopefully the next one will fit your amazing  grandiose  cinema  sophisticated and most importantly  beyond surface level  tastes in films.see you around bud
Imean he took a lot of damage to the head over time. that ability flower she ate helped too
almost being taken down by the bear showed us this yautja is unblooded  the lowest class  no real experience in taking on apex predators.
@eskimoulu  unblooded or blooded  her defeating him the way she did wasn t convincing. even when he spun her in mid air and slammed her to the ground  her back or neck should have been broken.predators cantake down an  alien queen. ellen ripley had to wear an exosuit to battle the alien queen. otherwise she would have been ripped apart like bishop was.
@eskimoulu   an unblooded predator still gets trained by blooded predators and is easily more than a match for a military trained person go look into the lore before making a statement like that.
she already knows how to use a gun  she is from the 20th century...
@the one  yeah  she saw it in a movie. lol.
wokeness isn t really too bad when used sparingly though. I really didn t have any problems with the whole movie in terms of wokeness or whatever
@ju ne   a woman beats a predator. they were never not gonna see wokeness
people rated this as 10 10  this is what predator fans wanted and we got just that  and  exceeded expectation  one of the best predator  even better than the original
are you serious  the dubbed version was distracting.
@the one  sure it was  I was in a classroom with others trying to watch it with headphones  I couldn t even focus because of the noise  but its also cuturally appropriate. I will have to download the original english version today. when I was torrenting it and I saw comanche dubbed and another version  I was like what the f is this  is this like a low res version   but after doing some background research I understood it was just the dubbed for comanche. and yes I downloaded it in x265 1080p so dont start thinking ohh he got a poor version  poor low res version thats for amateurs and besides melonie mac pays on my behalf.
literally the character development for every mary sue.  embrace her  kind of message.
I didn t think she was a complete mary sue  but she was definitely mary sue-ish.
the suspension of disbelief required for the final fight is quite high... lol   the rest of the idea of an extra terrestrial hunter species coming to earth was reasonable  but the fight at the end......I dunno......lmfao
@sean nanyabusiness  it was also quite high for adrian brody and danny glover.its the nature of the beast  literally.
I dont know why they felt the need to retcon the 1715 pistol. it belonged to a pirate captain who was enough of a chad that the predator wanted to hunt him  but his men mutinied after he refused to let them steal from a church. the predator pulled a  nobody kills him but me  and started killing the mutineers with him. the last of them shot the captain  and itsays a lot that his crew thought he was such a badass that they shot him and not the seven foot invisible monster  and the predator took his pistol to honour him as an absolute sigma male rather than as a trophy.
the issue I have with the  women in the kitchen  vibe and the  I want to be a hunter because you all say I cant  thing is that I feel it is lazy manipulative writing. it feels like the movie is trying to make us care about her goals and aspirations by making all her interactions mostly negative. it was though it wasn t enough for her to just want to better herself and bring her own unique skills to the tribe. instead it had to feel like  the man  is keeping her down and so her motivation became proving everyone wrong instead of proving to herself regardless of what everyone felt. I dont know much about comanche culture  but I found it odd that no one would encourage her to bring more food into the tribe by any means. hunting and gathering are not mutually exclusive and she seemed to already be proficient at medicine and healing. so why the big deal about her catching some rabbits on the side at the end of the movie after she levels up into a marvel superhero  she walks back into the camp without a single injury or remorse feelings of loss. it feels like she smugly just wants to give everyone the finger with a big   I told you so. she then looks over at the wide-eyed little girl with that  girl power  moment of   see  girls can be hunters too! all of it felt really manipulative. we are supposed to care about this person  but why  what qualities does she have that make us empathize with her  her peers are big meany pants  so what  she is nearly perfect at what she does and perfects every task she sets out to do almost instantly. she is validated throughout by her brother. she never gets injured. she has the ability to fight men  predator  and animals with the moves and stamina of black widow. she momentarily mourns the loss of her friends and brother  but never really seems to care beyond that or use it as motivation to survive and overcome. and  of course she is smarter than a beaver. I found the character and movie extremely boring and because I didn t fall for the little tricks to try and get me to care about her  I found myself not really caring who lived or died. in fact  I was kinda hoping she would die just to shake up the paint by numbers movie. in the end there was a missed opportunity here. I dont care about some 90 pound girl fighting a predator like a superhero. I wanted to see the tribe banding together to protect themselves from the creature. using their combined skills and talents as a people. it would have been much more interesting and much more in line with native culture. the last man standing thing has been done to death and there was nothing new here to justify seeing it again.
for you to get the point of the gun I would you watch predator 2 at the very end is important
I wonder if they made the dudes all go vegan for a bitso she could look better in comparison  I was kinda hoping she would kill the lion in that one scene  it would have shown she could do it.great to see you back melonie. are you gonna watch dragon ball super  super hero when its out
oh I get what youre doing.  thats funny.
I hate that we have to judge a movie based on how woke it is now instead of just saying whether or not its decent. this culture war has ruined how we view entertainment. but anyways  its nice to know a current day predator film isn t mediocre or flat out embarrassing. itsucks that this is exclusive to hulu though.
spoilers  obviously even though movies are full of nonsense  I legitimately cringed when she ran as fast as that dude away from the predator. I think politics are getting to me.the little rope tied to hatchet got to me too. she s a genius!the way they were holding their bows at the ready also annoyed me to no end.but of course  in movies characters do unrealistic things. thats just part of it. and people who make movies dont typically care how things really work. and thats something that I cannot excuse because typically it makes movies better if they portray things more realistically and it doesnt take that long to google search the main attributes and situations you put in your movie. what bothered me more in retrospect is the cgI and her not being interesting as a character.I think the movie would have been cooler without the french or their kinda out-of-place cartoony evil caricatures voices. and if they used some actual animals in their shots. I think this could have been a better movie if it was less formulaic.  the ending especially.   more built around the comanche culture. and if the bows and spears were used more proficiently.the one thing I did like about this movie  a lot  was the line that her hunt should not be about her proving herself. that the others hunt for survival. because thats a little more important in their situation than a self identity crisis. but they  and the main character  didn t really do anything with that information. she ignored what she was good at  and she just went on doing what she was going to do anyway. and because she ends up surviving in a way that feels quite lucky  it doesnt come across as the smarter play. or growth. or change. or anything  really.
yea the predator is probably the strongest character in the film
the first bit of the movie was super tropey but overall it wasn t bad. the shoe horning in of the pistol from predator 2 was dumb we can only imagine after the credits roll more yutja attack the village kill everyone and take itso it can be in there possession for predator 2
seems like a lot of female reviewers of prey are a little jealous
I think it had some good moments  and its watchable but far from being as good as let s say predator 2.
well  if she had a  glory kill   she wouldn t be angry or driven  would she
is it possible for it to be both
it was a pretty good movie. the feral predator was fking awesome. probably my favorite predator so far.  unfortunately the end of the movie was extremely telegraphed and very poorly written. it felt like a very empty flat ending.
thats actually the same gun from the end of predator 2.
it was fine somewhere between above avp but below predators she wasn t insufferable but the plot armor was annoying  she should never have been punched by that yautja her bones would literally be broken after that. there s a problem with that pistol memory berry like drinker said  that flintlock pistol ends up with a yautja and given to danny glover in pred 2 which implies she and her tribe are not gonna survive.
the main character actually did need that gun  so the french fur traders  who are historically accurate  were the vehicle to get that very significant gun into her possession. that gun was the same gun from predator 2  so it ties it into the franchise  and sets an easter egg for the context of the next prey movie. I do agree with you that the main character seemed detached from having any concern for her tribe members getting killed.
Im 73 and so-called woke since I was 6.
Im so sick of people claiming there is no woke in this movie  when there is. granted its not a lot and some of it is subtle  but there is still some woke in this movie. overall  I think its a decent movie with some really great moments but it also has plenty of cringe moments too. I will also say that it actually finally gets the predator premise correct  in that its a serious stalker movie  which the original had but most later movies failed. so while not a terrible movie  neither is it great  but is decent with good   bad moments. it could have been worse but it could also have been better.
how to pick up chicks pick up bears.
didn t know the pistol already had a backstory
@tom b.  aye. a great comic too  definitely worth reading.
this is what happens when its in the hand of disney. they will fk things up  they even made the avp movie non cannon now since in avp  predator has been to earth long before prey. disney now already have the right to predator s dark horse comic and its not going to be good if you are a huge predator fan.
hopefully they pull predator 2 from the cannon and go a different direction
so I know you didn t see the pirate in prey.
because that was a comic and they are not following a dark horse comic  they are creating original stories.
@the pineapple king  thats the problem. they re ignoring canon  and doing that is how we got into this mess.
@duncan mcokiner  they did the same thing with predator 2. they take what they want from the comics and throw away the rest. last time I checked there was no problem with that.
@geek savz fat_t  that is a problem. the violation of canon is how we ended up with shit like the mcu and disney star wars.
youreally nailed it with the  would have been cooler if its a whole tribe thing trying to survive against a super advanced alien .
identity politics
the movie could have worked better  if taabe was the lead character  naru gets killed in the 3rd act  then leads to a vengeful emotional final fight between man and predator. too bad my plot is a 2002 movie.  not a  modern  2022 film.
@leadsin99er  honestly  this movie would have worked fine with three tweaks. 1. all of naru s peers should have been supportive to indifferent. it was fine thatshe was motivated to be a hunter  but if her tribe hadn t been so heavy-handed in the  go home  gamer girl   women belong in the kitchen  nonsense in an attempt to make the audience like her or care about her struggle  it would have worked better because her motivation to become a good hunter like her peers would have been genuine instead of some   smash the glass ceiling  crap.2. naru needed to actually fail. people keep saying how she failed all the time  but they seem to be missing the key element. failure isn t about doing something wrong once then suddenly becoming great at the task. failure is one of those things that takes a long time to overcome. you dont go to a batting cage  miss a few baseballs  connect one and then join mlb. anyone who has tried to become good at something knows that you have success and failures all the time. the more you push yourself the more failures you have. if this movie would have showed her failing at tasks  but with minimal successes she was happy about  we would have felt empathy. we all know the feeling when you try a thousand times to do something and you get it once or twice. however  when youre suddenly faced with additional variables  nothing ever goes smoothly. ask any mma fighter if the training in the gym is the same as the fight in the ring. 3. naru needed to be human. it felt to me like the filmmakers were afraid to hurt their delicate flower. she needed to remain pretty and so every injury she sustained had no lasting consequences. she never got tired and in fact as the movie went on  she became more and more like a superhero. jumping from 50 foot trees  backflipping  sliding  twirling  stabbing grown men in the face  taking punches from adult males  running from a grizzly. she was never in danger ever and we all knew thatshe would survive. the movie told us early on that no injuries will hurt her in any way  so when she faces the predator  despite it ripping people apart  we never felt she was in any real danger. in the end she walks back into camp  pretty  perfect and intact with a chip on her shoulder as the tribe praises her for the hunt. this movie treated its main protagonist like a flower that could do no actual wrong or get hurt. she never really failed and the failure she did have was contrived and never seemed to matter again. when you factor in the bad cgI  bad dialogue  questionable predator motivations  etc. the movie just wasn t that good. it was  as you say a modern film with modern protections for its characters and modern portrayals.
@imperial walker  fair play you have nailed this films issues that I also have with it in a much better and more articulate way than I could have .
@british bulldog  thanks. much appreciated. I am glad people are enjoying the film  but I think healthy criticism is always good.
@leadsin99er  so you just dont like female leads
did you notice how all the natives were super clean cut abercrombie models and the trappers were the dirtiest hobos they could get  they visually tried to evoke hate for one group
honestly  it would have been more interesting if she was put in a position  forced into a corner to adapt and survive to fight the predator. like she had no choice but to be stronger and be able to fight in order to slay the predator and protect her tribe. it is more motivating and displays struggle to do what must be done. instead of just being motivated because others say she cant  this was victim mentality motivation  not interesting at all. the female focus rising as a warrior in a comanche tribe  even if unrelated historically  could ve been forgiven and interesting. but it was a missed opportunity and instead a platform for victim mentality  identity politics  and toxic femininity. instead of being   I will be a tough gal because I want to be and because the men say I cant.  be   I have to be a tough gal cuz I have to protect my tribe and the threat has already taken out many other warriors  Imust push myself to be the next defense.  one is selfish motivation  and the other is selfless motivation and true empowerment. missed the opportunity to display a truly strong female character.
@crimzon nova  absolutely. that is a much more universal and noble motivation. I am actually quite surprised thatso few people picked up on what you said. itseemed obvious and pretty trite to me  but the majority of people seemed to not notice or ignore it. in the end  my care for this character was pretty low because I never connected with thatselfish motivation. and  like Ive mentioned before  the other characters had to be written to unrealistically put down the protagonist to try and make itseem like she had it harder than she did. you nailed it though. this movie is pretty typical modern movies. I think people were just mesmerized by how pretty it looked in combination of not wanting to be the one to criticize the characters.
its like you watched the movie from inside my head. I just watched prey tonight and you summed up all of my feelings and observations incredibly faithfully. my wife fell asleep after 30 minutes and that girl-power look at the end  after 90 minutes of exasperating mary sue-isms from the sulky lead   made me sorry I hadn t had a snooze myself.
agreed
only neckbeards review movies like that. I can link you to tons of non biased creators who review movies like rational adults!
youre cringing because she ran as faster as another guy in her tribe
@josh cramer  yeah  it looked weird. but like I said  I caught myself because movies do weird things all the time and in this movie alone there are much much weirder things. so I realized that what I was thinking didn t make much sense.
stopping a predator from killing her tribesmen should be more than enough motivation I think lol
my only gripe was she didn t get the whole  all the predators show up and pay respects after the fight  clip like most of the movies. thats literally it. I liked this movie alot. its not perfect but its a step in the right direction
of course it is  they had to jammed that gun scene in there to make people watch the movie. you do know the gun from predator 2 and the gun from prey aren t connected since they retconned the comic lore. predator 2 was from a comic...
dude she killed a group of men on her own. saw it coming a mile away
@khayree  I forgot about that yeah that plot armor too lol
@justin carloz maxino  if you watch again you ll no doubt find a lot of plot armor moments. some that even contradicts what the predator is as a character.
I felt the gun was ham-fisted. they needed the callback so they jammed it into the story. the problem is that there was so much focus on her axe. the movie sets that weapon up and her skill with itso much that we expect a huge payoff  but it kinda gets lost in the edit. the pistol moments got so much focus  but the axe just kinda popped up when it needed to.
@imperial walker  bad writing
@imperial walker  she hit the predator in the leg with the axe and she wrapped the rope around it  putting it off balance so it tripped into the bog. seems there was a big payoff just there.
@alfred stimoli  I suppose. I just didn t see it that way. the movie sets up the axe to be used in a certain way  having the dog run it in  slicing the leg  then jabba the hutt choking it just didn t feel like it got the same level of focus as the pistol. the pistol seemed to become its own character  where the axe was forgotten about until it randomly needed to show up.
@imperial walker  the axe is used to show she thinks outside the box  she isn t the greatest at killing with it  so she makes extremely fast to reset before all the rabbits leave  allowing her to efficiently hunt.
@eskimoulu  I understand why. I just didn t buy it. that is like learning to karate kick and you try to kick a few times but the leg of your pants keeps getting in the way  so you rollup the leg and suddenly you cantake out 10 ninja.
better than whatever the fuck 2018 predator.
@the pineapple king  so  the predator can defeat a massive grizzly bear in seconds  but he has trouble with a 100 pound girl that never gets anything more than a scratch. and she beat the predator all by herself using moves from asian culture that indians didn t ever use. she s a mary sue and this was woke.
predator has a 10 pack abs. I felt inadequate
she is more sad about the buffalo than her own hunting party who all died because of her.
I liked it
when do we get a predator zombie movie. predators are dropped on earth for a hunt only to discover a resident evil type zombie plague. a predator vs nemesis.
I wanted to like prey too  because it was something fresh and I dig weird westerns...  rant time for a film  that prided itself on its native cast  the protagonists are so obviously mixed  it hurts the eye. come on! half of canada is working for the us film industry now! my white ass has darker hair  than the brother. they even ordered a 2000  word puff piece from national geographic.Ive read my share of predator novels. the yautja breathe methane  but this alien is running around and fighting with an uncovered mouth. and it looked like it was ordered from wish. the cloaking device shouldn t work in water. and the creature should ve had a plasmacaster  because they were already equipped with them in ancient times in the avp flashback. and these aliens respect females  because alien queens are the ultimate trophy to them. even their own females are bigger and tougher  which was established in the 1994 prey novel.there was a french colonization attempt is texas  but it failed 30 years before this film takes place  and they were in the eastern part and faced entirely different tribes. texas was spanish and mexican  so the main enemies the tribes would face  apart from each other  were mestizo soldiers fighting for spain.extensive bison slaughter began more than a hundred years later. people armed with ponderous flintlock muskets would have never been able to kill that many animals. you needed the sharps rifle to shoot scores of buffalo  which wasn t invented until the middle of the 19th century! and killing the animals and leaving the meat behind was a cruel tactic devised by the american government to starve and subjugate the plains indians. it wasn t done by early 18th century frenchmen  who had little to no contact with the comanche people. pierre antoine and paul malett were the first frenchmen to meet comanche in 1739  20 years after the film takes place. this choice was deliberate  they didn t want the human antagonists to be hispanics  because they feared cancellation by twitter and because they couldn t use the film to demonize white men again.and have your protagonist lift some weights and do some push-ups a la linda hamilton  because she looks like someone  who could be knocked over by her own pooch  yet she s fighting 6 ft men and a 7 ft alien. the 1994 prey  an avp novel had a female protagonist  machiko noguchI  who was a black belt and ended up fighting aliens and rogue predators with another predator.the comanche were far more brutal to women. they kidnapped whites  mexicans and natives alike and gang rape was an accepted method of warfare. cynthia ann parker s story is the best example. they should ve chosen the apache  they had documented warrior women like lozen  gouyen and dahteste.Im not going to lie  there were a few dodgy fight scenes in 1 and 2. but this takes the cake  the brother turns into legolas and shoots arrows at the predator in close combat. he also pulls arrows out of the alien s body to reuse them. ludicrous. the movie should ve been about the yautja and a group of two or three human characters stalking each other.the atrocious cgI was a minor problem compared to the above.
it was solid. it doesnt line up with the comic books but what does anymore
I thought it was about going back to the native american era before english settlers coming to north america being forced to fight the yaujta. but when I heard woke things I got nervous
a message to most normies. you see. predator can kill buff seasoned mercenaries. yet a strong independent little wamen goes super saiyan against predator 1vs1. even arnold struggled and used his traps to win  and he s much stronger and more well trained than a 90 pound 5 3  little wamen
the movie is actually good
I would say  for me the first two are still better than this but this one sits at a decent third place but that is mostly due to the cinematography itself  it was a really well shot movie. I did not mind that its a female lead at all and I thought the actress did a good job but she could have been given a better script probably  my main problem here is that the predator itself seemed a bit dumb in some of the instances  he was making some really obvious mistakes that no other predator would make. but overall I did enjoy the film  it had a good pace from start to finish
I was hoping this movie was going to be good. because I love monster creature movies. but I just couldn t like her character. I liked the bone mask on the predator. the predator looked really cool. you made some really good points. I wonder if it didn t test well and thats why it was on streaming instead of theaters  it needed a cool climatic ending. good video melonie. Im looking forward to the next Godzilla movie. you get two thumbs up
welcome to the club melonie   furry hahaha
12 35 I like your multiple score methodology.  overalls are kinda useless.  people look for different things in movies.  it is also a funny coincidence.  I just watched a yt  the best and worst thing about every tomb raider.
hey melonie I just want to say that welcome back home to texas and hope you have had a wonderful and great time with your family and your adorable and cute nephew. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just thought the new movie prey was great movie and I was sad that the predator got killed at the end of the movie and I was thinking about what will happen next if they do next sequel to prey 2 movie and who will be the next monster who will fight the indian girl who just killed the predator  anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to say I really like the movie and the outfit that the predator had on and the mask that predator had that it was a cool design that it was just cool and neat. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and tell you what I think bout the new prey movie  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
a strong female lead doesnt make a movie woke. ellen ripley and sarah connor were strong female leads. the test is whether or not they made the movie as a form of entertainment or to just to push a particular social ideology..  and yes people are smart enough to tell the difference.
I lost it when the 90-pound native girl killed 4 or 5 french mountain men in hand-to-hand combat. the final fight was disappointing and the ending felt like a feminist girl power here me roar ending.
it was ok  definitely a woke movie though. she had zero compassion for the dead hunting party or her brother and his body  could have been written twice as good but it was a solid c movie.
Im never watching it  but its nice to see an opinion from a normal person.
fluff!!
2nd best predator movie in the franchise. I like the whole native theme. something different. solid female lead. and the action is up there. I dont really hate anything much about prey. it was enjoyable to watch. gory. they should build something after this movie. sucks this wasnt in theatres. cinematography was pretty solid aswell
he will have a beer belly in the woke version
@melonie mac go boom
poor writing and little to no history research. according to prey  the avp movie is non cannon cause in prey  its the first time the predator comes to earth but in avp  predator already been to earth long before that and human were worshipping them as God. I think disney just want to butcher everything they touches.
@the one  I love the consoomer attempt to explain the primitive weaponry  saying  that its the past. I pointed out  that the alien would ve arrived in a flying saucer if this was the case.
the yautja has to be blooded to use the plasmacaster.  if it doesnt have one it is a young blood  or unblooded.  considering how much damage it takes facing a bear  and being caught by the french  itseems to be unblooded.
referencing a bunch of things from a God awful non canonical cross over movie and non canon comics has zero meaning to the main film franchise
comics are not canon
@ m nlamb  fair enough point.
Ive watched the dubbed version of it for the authenticity coz 300 years ago comanche tribe didn t speak english. slow pace from the start. I thought I was watching tomb raider  comanche edition. weird village though. no adult men. not the best predator movie but definitely not the worst. will there be a sequel for this
84 days til  halloween
I 100  agree. I rate the issues as a little bit higher problems than you do  so I rate the movie lower than you did in the end  but I do agree with all your comments. the character work and the dialogue was just so bad
its woke... too woke
dakota beavers noted that each of his fellow male actors wore culturally relevant regalia that was special to each of them and an honor to their native heritage. actor tymon carter  who plays huupI  wore a makeup design similar to that of his grandfather  with three horseshoes. rumball incorporated the horseshoes on his arm and body makeup.  ancestry was brought into the movie  and I believe all of the cast were proud to wear the warrior makeup we designed with them   indigenous peoples worked hard on this movie and the community is proud of it  sorry that you wanted racism  natives obviously would not create things racist against themselves   h
am I the only one who roots for the predators in these movies  I know how its going to end  but I cant wait to see him in action.
3 54 omg malony its a furry  and beast lover  jk
I never heard anything about this movie being woke. the only time I heard of it being woke was here on youtube. but  I didn t take the movie thatseriously  Imean its a movie. I just watched it for mindless entertainment  which is what most esp action movies tend to be.
I watched someone reacting to a tik tok reacting to a video of a girl that looks like melonie eating a stick of butter as a snack.  I know she s into carnivore but does it include eating sticks of butter
featuring native culture and actors was great  forcing in the feminist angle sucked.  my wife cringed at the  you underestimate me thats what makes me dangerous speeches  and thatshe beat up dudes like she was a marvel character.  they pretended this movie was about native culture but it was really about a modern feminist message  with a native coat of paint.would have been better if it was about her brother  or at least didn t go for  girls do it better   in their attempts to destroy tropes they have just replaced old tropes with new ones.the main char was completely unlikable.the action was cool but the predator was a complete moron compared to the predators in the first two movies. they hunted their prey  this one just walked in and tanked everything.  I guess you could argue it did it because there wouldn t have been any challenge if it fought like it would against modern weapons if you want to be generous.ending sucked either way  it ending up in that exact spot doing that thing again was to convenient.overall okay movie.  not even close to the original.
concept was good  and overall the movie was okay.  the  oppression of women   patriarchy keeping women down and white man bad woke themes  approached too much  but didn t quite get there.  even the fact that there would not have been such acceptance  of a woman  in their tribe  hunting and tracking.  sorry  their culture was what it was.  however   it was the mary sue aspect of the main character that put everything as too much. for crying out loud the predator took out a full grown grizzley  an entire company of armed trappers  her fwllow tribesman whom have fought in battles and her brother  who was shown to be a much better fighter  as well as bigger  faster and stronger.  then she wins a far better ending would have been her and her brother beating the predator together  and them returning to triumph as her validation kill.
what do u think about a latina playing marilyn monroe in the new movie blonde
a far better movie would have been 1  scrap all the feminist agenda2  make the brother the protagonist3  make the whole tribe  united  fight against the predator...using hunting and guerrilla skills  traps to lure him. etc...build different characters  give them flesh and make the public care  and then have some meaningful deaths...etc...final confrontation with the brother and some help from others companions  to even the field
spot on. also  its hot that you think the predator is hot.  inception hotness  ha ha.  -
she goes from not being able to kill a deer to killing an apex predator in no time. that is not believable. for once  I would like to see the predator win .
I liked it. but I also plan to do my first fan edit on it. streamline out the woke  and its salvageable.
its okay movie tbh
this movie is actually not bad  has some very nice and cool scenes ...but...its totally ruined by a main actress that cant absolutely act  her dog acts better than her ...always  always over-acting with ridiculous facial expressions  she doesnt know subtlety...and is totally out of part  making the whole thing super-unbelieavable  her brother is far better  up until he inevitably dies to give the stage to her ...she basically seems like a modern teenager taken out of beverly hills 90210 and inserted by force in an ancient tribal context...also the perfect english  mixed with some native words  contrast so much with the  tribal theme  that adds another layer of  incredibility ...taking you out of the atmosphere of the movie in most parts  they should have add some native accents to the english version ...wokeism is very present  obviously  and some scenes look and sound absolutely laughable because of it  when all the females in the tribe goes one way and she blatantly goes the opposite  with triunphant music  meaning she is phisically going against the common rules and the patriarchy...yeah...the director doesnt know subtlety as well   ddd ...but all in all considering  its not sooo much to be unbearable...I d give the whole movie a 7 10 mainly because of the  redesigned  image of the predator and some action scenes...but with a decent main protagonist  male or female  dont care  but more believable in the part at least  would have been easy a 8 10 or more...
female led movie done right
it is not as good as the 2st 2 but it is miles better than the last few.
ehhh  something wrong with you bro.
I would have loved to see him get a w. predators cant lose every time  we need at least one movie with a win
exactly. its a movie  not a documentary. I just turn my brain off and enjoy it. Imean  its an alien fighting a native american. I enjoyed the movie.
shaking my head @ melonie s review saying this movie was woke. it was not. prey was definitely better than the last movie the predator.
that was me eating the butter lol
@melonie mac go boom  why  is that a you thing or carnivore thing
umm  what makes you think she couldnt kill a deer  just cause she missed her throw that means she cant kill something  cause the next day she hunt kills a bunch of rabbits. the deer ran away versus her hunting and stalking the predator.
she goes from saying  I know how to survive  to figuring out a weakness and surviving using its own strength  tech  against them. predators aren t  apex  they are sent to different planets to hunt train as teenagers which is why they only fight an enemy they see as a threat.
to be fair  he was in a weakened state and was killed with his own tech  but I get your point.  meaningful character arcs are a bit challenging in a story that occurs over a couple days.
@darthmerlin  to be fair  the chick was fighting him whenever she felt like it. he had his back completely turned on her asking to get flanked. since when does predator completely gives up his guard like that
@khayree  he literally does that in predator 2 on the roof  after he threw his combistick.
when I saw this I was thinking about ripley from aliens. dudes were laughing at her because she was a woman too. but she showed thatshe could fight.and this girl didn t use brute strength to defeat the predator  she found ways to outsmart it and take advantage of the fact that it was underestimating humans  and her even more so because she seemed harmless initially. this didn t seem like some blatant feminist agenda movie to me. but I was worried that it was going to be just that.but you could see thatshe could have died several times in this movie  but men actually saved her life on more than one occassion.she fucked up several times until she finally figured out a way to beat the predator.
@melaniemac - what does woke mean to you  mel
... the critical drinker  nerdrotic  geeks n gamers  the quartering  heelsvsbabyface and many others with a similar premise. has a strong incel fanbase that they lean heavily for views and monetary gains  their reponse is not surprising since these channels content primary runs on hate baiting.these people are pretty much the same as the woke culture monster they project to hate.
I didn t enjoy it that much. the sliding in the dirt  the axe throwing boomerang effect like a mortal kombat move was a lil cringy.. I probably like it more seeing that the girl wanted to be a hunter so bad thatshe had to learn by watching the predator when she came across it. she used the predator s ways to survive. now  that be even better
all I gotta say is love or hate the movie  that bear scene was awesome!
you completely missed the point of her character. itstarted off as I want to be a hunter but if you paid attention her mom teachers her its about survival. and thats exactly what she did. she didn t beat predator with her own hands she used his tech against him . in other words she survived and that was the whole point of her trial
anyone think she sounds like alteori
how bout keep the same premise of native americans fighting the predator but idk have just men warriors fight him! ! that would be historically accurate having the men fighting  native women did not fight unless the camp was under attack. and that dog was way too modern looking too  couldn t get a husky at least  this whole movie was trash idky people are praising this movie. this could have been a badass predator film. it could have been a mixture of apacalytpo friday the 13th predator. just have a whole tribe out hunting away from their village maybe a few days ride away. the feral  and cannibalistic  predator has only been on earth for a few days and is hungry maybe tired of eating animals already and hunts these men instead  for sport and taste for their blood. so now its got the survival aspect of apacalytpo  horror slasher of friday the 13th  and classic predator all rolled into one. Im a better screenwriter and I dont even have the credentials. where s my millions of dollars

and Im supposed to believe a 12 year old girl is gonna take out the predator  nah.. no thanks. holy shite! just watched sargon s review and she is 25!
I think this was the first time I disagree with your points  I really enjoyed the film  1   I think a  3rd party  like the french trappers was good  their purpose is to make the  naru    the  predator  look good by displaying their skills removing them would be like removing the  guerillas  in the first film who were there to make  dutch  and his team look good  same goes for  the  scorpions   jamaicans  in the 2nd film were the to make  harrigan  and the  predator  look good  it has nothing to do with them being white.the  guerillas   scorpions  who are not white were depicted as negative  especially the  jamaicans  who are black were depicted super negatively as  voodoo  cultists.in the first film  dutch  and his team went to  guatemala  to rescue hostages.dutch even said to dillon  we are a rescue team  not assassins  so their initial mission was not to massacre guerrillas.but the minute they landed they found  jim hoppers  team skinned and hung up the trees  the film could ve completely removed the  guerillas  same as the  french trappers  3rd party  bullet sponges are nothing new to predator since the  80s  I understand that you would ve preferred if it was exclusively the predator going on a  comanche  killing spree than hurting white french trappers but honestly  I dont think its that bad.I honestly think its unfair especially when the were french trappers given more screen time then any other 3rd party was given in the predator films  yet they are the only problem. come on. 2   it would be impossible for  naru  to kill a healthy predator which is why the french trappers are just as necessary as the wolf  the bear  and the comanches they were there to weaken the predator  by the end of this film this thing got bitten by a wolf  mauled by a bear  sneered with a bear trap  shot with muskets  slashed and speared by comanches  shot in the brain and lost an arm. 3   I disagree with you saying  you didn t like how she struggled at first in the film and I prefer that over the rey skywalker route  this is an underdog story which is why I want it to be as such  thats why she had a character arc  I would even argue her being good from the start would cause a lot of rage and people would call her a mary sue.she did get better  she even killed 4 french trappers by herself so there was progression.luke skywalker failed the entire film and in the end solo destroyed the death star  that doesnt make it bad character progression.   4   I also disagree with you saying she needed to give them a reason to believe in her by getting  cool hunts  but the problem is that they dont want her to  hunt  in the first place  they are preventing her from going through her k htaamia  right of passage   she was given an axe by her father and the predators spaceship was a sign to her. 5   I also disagree with you saying she knew how to  operate the gun  when she clearly didn t  she used the body temperature flower and stood nearby because she didn t want to take a shot from a long-range shot  thats why it was close-range so she wouldn t miss. 6   the predator didn t see  naru  as a threat because she was being hunted by a bear  if you watch the film he hunted predators  not prey  and halfway through the film  he started taking her seriously along with her brother seriously. 7   the brother was there to serve as a symbol of a great hunter and their sibling rivalry  there were so many instances where he didn t believe in her  shot her down  and demoralized her while also supporting her as a sibling would  there was even instance were  naru  was jealous of her brother for killing the lion and receiving all the glory.she wants to close the gap between them  and thats why she went out to prove herself and him wrong  I would even argue the best fight in the show was the brother vs the predator so he did stand out on his own.I super disagree with your take on her brother  saying he was only just there to validate her and didn t stand out on his own. 8   I dont see her wanting to be a hunter instead of a herbalist as  woke  in anyway  she just doesnt want to do itsame as  lara  didn t want to be a proper high society lady like most women in aristocratic families  she found it boring and simply didn t want to do it.Im gonna stand my ground on this one  there s nothing woke about her not wanting to  stay in the kitchen  in this scenario or film  she seems to have always had that goal of being a hunter  from her father giving her his axe   her being trained by her brother and her seeing the predator ship as a symbol of the  thunderbird  and her sign thatshe s ready for her k htaamia.I dont mind if you gave it a 6.5 10  but the points you mentioned were completely unfair or makes no sense to me as a predator fan  especially with your 11 53  combat amnesia   peripheral vision  point I honestly didn t understand it  because these things have an honor system and have terrible vision as a species.-  was it  combat amnesia  when the predator didn t kill the woman in the first film  he was savage with the dudes.-  was it  combat amnesia  when the predator didn t kill the pregnant policewoman  he was savage with the dudes.-  was it  combat amnesia  when the predator didn t shoot the kid holding a toy gun  he was savage with the dudes.-  did it lose  peripheral vision  when dutch was right in front of it covered in mud  all it had to do was look left as you said.-  did it lose  peripheral vision  when keys and his team were right below  all it had to do was look down as you said.but somehow someway when the predator in prey does not see  naru  when she cooled down her body heat its bad it had 4 encounters with naru.-  it let her go the 1st time because she was not a threat and was being cornered by a bear.-  it let her go the 2nd time because she to snared by a trap and taken by french trappers. -  it let her go the 3rd time because she was being used as bait along with her brother and he prefers to hunt.-  it let her  go the 4th time because her brother sacrificed himself so she could escape.
you should read berserk
I thought it was surprisingly decent  definitely the best predator movie in a while.
the french that epeak comanche teach her how to use the gun  and she save his live   then the pretator kill him
this movie was great. cant believe anyone would complain when looking at the previous predator movies we have lately.
my problem to start with this movie is that it is almost 100  a rip off of a college student film down to the exact same make up  war paint  there has got to be some suits over this. I love films with native americanthemes since my grandmother was native american but a predator film was not the place  I just cannot suspend disbelief enough  Imean modern technology can barely allow us to beat one  bows and muskets do not cut it against predator. I am a stickler for some historical accuracy and it annoys me that during the time period this is set in the comanche were already on the southern plains  they were no longer in the mountains forests so that was not accurate and the comanche were pretty rigid with women s roles in society so that was not accurate either  it would not have bothered me as much if they had not bragged about how historically accurate this film would be regarding the comanche.
beep boop
I said as much elsewhere but I ll say it here as well.eh  5 10 for me.could not root for the mc. came across as a condescending mary sue unable to achieve her full awesomeness because of the patriarchy to where it felt like I was watching mulan again at points minus the superpowers. ptsd I did not need to relive.they could ve made her a much more compelling and likable character if they just dropped the whole her trying to be a warrior thing. make her a tracker healer  one skilled enough that the warriors respect and want with them when they re on the hunt. then we could have the scene with the puma   one where she isn t telling them things they should already know  things go wrong and she ends up having to be an active participant in killing the cat earning the respect of the warriors so that they give her the title of warrior. she still sees the light and they all decide to investigate leading them into the events of the rest of the film. then the warriors dying would have more of an impact because they re not just bodies  they re a part of her family thats being butchered. but she sees where they and the frenchmen failed and learns from their mistakes leading her to being able to outsmart the predator at the end of the film where  as a collective unit  she and one or two of the other hunters manage to kill the predator instead of trying to 1v1 it like everyone else.
she really just said  yeah I think the big lizard is hot  bro this is the craziest review Ive seen. no wonder you eat butter
I absolutely love this movie  best predator movie since the original
nobody was laughing at ripley. we all loved alien and ripley.
you contradicted yourself.
@johnd  he means the dudes in the crew within the film  not actual people.
@ m nlamb  but the characters in the film never did that. thats one of the things that made the film so memorable. the women on board were just part of the crew and treated like everybody else. the android disobeyed her  but thats because she was on the way and had to be eliminate to complete the mission.
@johnd  why are you telling me thing john Im just telling you what he meant.
@ m nlamb  and why are you telling me what you think he meant
@independent aquaman  explain.
@johnd   we all loved alien and ripley   oh Im sorry I didn t realise I was chatting with the ambassador of the world all the way from 1986. must be difficult to speak on the behalf of everyone from such a long time ago.
@johnd  because you said  we all loved alien and ripley  as if he was talking about the people fans hating ripley.sounded like you misunderstood.
@lionofdawn  I was born in 1970. I was 9 years old when the movie came out. I watched it in the cinema and everybody loved it. not everybody is a 12 years old kid like you.
I agree with all those people  what does that make me
thank you. but people have to go into everything thinking its  woke culture
nah. her character made 0 sense. she beat up a man on her own. she killed a group of guys on her own. she went full head on with predator even going as far as to take off his arm.
@khayree  and... she did it without a single detrimental injury. she walked out of the camp pretty and able and returned home pretty and able... with more of a chip on her shoulder.
@imperial walker  when she was doing parkour all over the predator  I was like  is this even a predator movie  this is the type of movie you see in netflix with low budget like sharknado.
I completely agree with you  I respect her opinion but she was extremely unfair with her review.
say what you want but you lost me at the rey part. the character had huge mary sue tendencies. such as beating up men  figuring predator out after very few encounters  insane plot armor moments  she wasn t a good character.
we got a predator historian here. mm should pin this comment to the top.
way to misrepresent her points  brah.
@duncan mcokiner  name me a part were Imisreprsentet her points.and I will timestamp every argument she said.
@khayree  I didn t know a woman beating up men is a  mary sue  tendency. I guess  lara croft  is mary sue then. every hero in film history has  superior intuition   observation skills  over others that is how films have always worked -   was  arnold dutch  a mary sue when he  figured  out that the  predator  cant see mud -   was  arnold dutch  a mary sue when he  figured  out that the countdown on the  predator  gauntlet is a bomb -   was  harrigan danny  a mary sue when he  figured  out that the predator can see the  lights  just by looking at the tv -   was  harrigan danny  a mary sue when he  figured  out how to use the predator s  smart disc -  dutch arnold fell down a waterfall  survives  then  conveniently  the mud he s rolling on makes him invisible to the predator. plot armor  -  then the predator shots multiple  plasma caster  shots at dutch arnold when he was hiding in the trees  none of them hit. plot armor  -  then when the predator gets  dutch arnold  it doesnt use its wrist blades to kill him  instead  it plays around with him. plot armor  -  harrigan danny literally encounters a predator on a rooftop  and points a gun at it but instead of killing him  it runs away. plot armor  -  then it follows  harrigan  to his meeting with  king willy  and instead of killing them both like he did the jamaican it lets him go. plot armor  -  it also follows  harrigan  to the grave yard  has clear shot with the plasma-caster  and lets him go. plot armor  -  let s not forget after it massacres people on the train  and takes jerry s skull  harrigan shows up with a pistol  instead of killing him right then and there it runs away again. plot armor  I dont know why you people are trying so hard to hate this film  its as if you ve never watched a predator film before.is  naru  being a woman that annoying to you guys that you make up dumb shit that your can 100  argue with the previous films.talking about mary sue and plot-armor  just enjoy the film like a normal person  and if you dont like it great but dont give reasons that make zero sense.
@ m nlamb  your points are obsolete. it took dutch nearly the whole movie to understand the predator. also  dutch is a trained soldier who has a lot of combat experience. it made sense for him to understand it would explode while it was going in a tick tick sequence. glover was literally investigating and understanding predator as well. these characters you brought were already good at the things you listed because it was literally in their field. the chick was literally overpowering men and going head to head with predator. if that not mary sue-ish to you I dont know what is. dont know why you people are trying so hard to take up for this movie.
@roy tomas  Im just a fan.
@khayree  that is the first problem you call her a  chick  I bet you would never call ellen-ripley or sarah connor a  chick  you clearly just dont like this girl.you ignore her training   skills  and describe her as if she s a normal civilian  she was born a comanche in a warrior clan.dutch is a trained soldier  who specializes in investigation and tracking.danny is a trained cop  who specializes in investigation and trackingnaru is a comanche hunter  who specializes in investigation and tracking.she was trained by her father who gave her his axe before he died  then trained by his brother who was the best hunter and chief of the clan.literally  her brother said she was the best  tracker  at the beginning of the film.just like dutch and harrigan  she spent the entire 1st and 2nd parts of the film talking about weird assurances happening in the forest and the massive footprints of a creature she doesnt know.she s been investigating and trying to understand the predator throughout the whole thing.why is it right for you to say it makes sense for arnold to understand but someone who s lived in a forest  near animals trained since she was little shouldn t understand there is no way you believe a trained soldier makes for a better tracker than a native hunter who s lived there their entire life.if you put dutch  harrigan  and naru in a  random  forest they dont know for a month then pull them out.I can guarantee you she would have a greater understanding of its terrain  plants  and animals and would come out in better shape.listen if you consider every female action hero who s ever overpowered men  mary sueing then thats your problem.let s not forget she fought the predator with her dog  itsave her multiple times  she would be dead without it.she. is. a. comanche.she is the same as billy  and just like him they feel things and have intuition.quit the shit.youre making no sense.
@ m nlamb  we can agree or disagree  its part of being in a fandom. like mm is a fan of tomb raider  its fine. I can see why many people enjoyed this prey movie. the movie had its moment. my only complaint is that the movie is in english. I watched the  comanche dubbed version  for realism. relax guys  its just a movie.
no  its not
@roy tomas  I also didn t like the english as much as the comanche dub  I agree.I also love tomb raider as well  Ive agreed with everything she s said about it.I 100  agree that its just a movie but people dont treat it like a movie  they treat it like its some kind of agenda.I actually dont even care about the score she gave it  just the reasons why  they make no sense  especially for predator.imagine a review that gave rise of the tomb raider a 6.5 10 sure whatever.but if the reason they didn t like it is because there was too much exploring  puzzles  and hidden tombs in the game  then its gonna feel weird to me as a tomb raider fan.this is how this  prey  review feels to me  it feels a bit unfair.I hope you understand what Im trying to say here  I hope I didn t ramble.
@ m nlamb  no worries. at least this one is better than the previous 2 predators movie. hate those two. well  you cantell mm is not a predators fan. mm fans dont blast me...I understand her pov. I had to drink coffee to watch the first part of the movie coz it was too slow pace. things only get interesting from the bear scene onwards.
@roy tomas  I see what you mean.and yeah I cantell she s not a predator fan.this is honestly the first time Ive ever disagree with a video of hers.the previous film was a disaster.
@ m nlamb  did sarah connor overpower terminator  did ripley beat an alien to death with her bare hands  if the chick was always that good of a fighter would she not be up there with the men  and it makes sense for arnold to understand because he specifically trained for those situations as well as having already been in many of those situations leading up to that point. the chick was never established as being a hood fighter  she s just immediately thrown in. surely those guys wouldn t have been talking to her the way they did if she could fight like that. if you put the 3 of them in a jungle her understanding would be no different from dutch. only harrigan wouldn t understand because he s always in the city. Im fine with female action heroes but at least make them make sense. you literally did this to yourself when you got her going head to head taking on a 7ft tall predator in full on combat. dutch the most physically fit and conditioned of all of them could not fight predator head on  yet the chick could. going as far as to cutting off its arm
@khayree  Im convinced.  you didn t watch  the movie.please stop watching youtube clips and the watch the whole movie.none of the things you mentioned  naru  did in the film.-  she didn t overpower the predator like you said she did.-  she didn t beat the predator with her bare hands like you said she did.-  she didn t even fight it alone as you said she did  she tag teamed it with her dog.-  she didn t cut off its arm like you said it did  the predator cut its  own  arm off with a shield.harrigan cut-off the predators  arm-off  by himself  but nobody is complaining about that though.harrigan also beat the predator head on  in melee  but nobody is complaining about that though.hanzo  also beat the predator head on  with a katana  but nobody is complaining about that though.royce  also beat the predator head on  with an axe  but nobody is complaining about that though.why are you talking as killing a predator head on is impossible  its happened multiple times in the films and the comics already.let s not forget that  naru  is the only protagonist to fight an  unhealthy  predator  it was already extremely injured and she didn t even do it alone either.every other portagonist went into their final battles with a  healthy  predator and won.arnold dutch didn t even use his physical strength to fight the predator neither did naru  both of them used weapons  their intelligence  traps and agility to beat it. physical fitness never mattered into killing a predator  you need agility  weapons and intelligence. the chick was never established as being a hood fighter  she s just immediately thrown in the first part of the film which you also didn t watch ready established she was trained by her father who left her his axe before he died  than was trained by her brother who s the chief and best hunter in the village and she was training herself  in secret which she also told her brother.just from that you could immediately assume she s a good fighter unlike an normal civilian  she was already skilled just lacked the experience  she s probably fought her brother from training before.dutch   royce are soldiers I dont need the film to tell me their good fighters Im gonna assume they are.harrigan is a cop I dont need the film to tell me he s a good fighter Im gonna assume he already is.naru is a hunter born in a warrior clan and trained since she was a kid I dont need the film to tell me she s a good fighter Im gonna assume she already is. and it makes sense for arnold to understand because he specifically trained for those situations the movie never established that  but Im gonna assume he was because he s a soldier. having already been in many of those situations leading up to that point the movie never established that  but Im gonna assume he was because he s a soldier.see how that works. surely those guys wouldn t have been talking to her the way they did if she could fight like that yes  they 100  would  didn t you watch the film those guys literally fought head on against the predator when it revealed itself  they would not give a damn if  naru  could fight or not  that makes no damn sense.go watch the damn movie.Im done with you.
@aj25  she s a grifter bro. just spins everything negative to fit her agenda.
the producer of the movie is comanche and blackfoot.
I say this full well knowing that I think the squid monster in fellowship of the ring is handsome
predators 2010 would like a word
@mitch  thats 3rd place for me.
I didnt feel like it was overly sjw preachy about  white man bad.  yah they were shitty but at that time period and those kind of rough necks they would have been. these are men who sailed around the world to live and hunt in the wilderness with no civilization and no women etc. the men from her own tribe kicked her azz. so I felt like it was p accurate all around with how people would have behaved at that time period and wasn t trying to throw shade. I agree there could have been more character development  but I also agree with your point of  let s just get to the action  so I was fine with that. all in all it was pleasantly surprising that it was a pretty good film imo.
oh so your a domestic now  good. where s the elvis review
of course its woke just look at the main character  if she somehow ends up defeating the predator at the end then its the most unbelievable concept ever in a film.. this actress is in no way believable as a huntress   to believe that a predator would loose to this beautiful frail   petite young women is just  it makes the whole movie silly   stupid af to watch on screen  all the males casted were frail on purpose to not make the main character stick out sooo much for being what she is  frail   petite   even though all the males are built physically the same as the main character the men will still be stronger  Im not being sexist just stating simple facts males have more testosterone so they have that  man strength   overall great review but I ll def skip this one
my thought were why wasn t this predator the one they sent after schwarzenegger in the first movie  way more bad ass than the one he faced.  cinematography was very cool but that was about it for me  pretty meh at best.
her brother did pretty much all the work in the film . didn t understand why they made her so terrible at hunting   why not make her the best in the village and predator makes her go  oh crap  gotta up my game .
as time goes on I would have preferred if both alien and predator had no sequels or prequels. those that followed just weren t as good as the original. as usual the sequels or prequels just dont age as well as the first movie does. alien was more or less the perfect horror movie and I dont think its ever been topped. and predator might have been arnold s best movie. after that is was like going from premium ice cream to that nasty fat free junk with a big dose of hype.
its not  woke  at all. good movie.
the original predator is fine  but extremely overrated. prey certainly has an agenda and fumbles the ending a bit  but its still the best predator movie.
another good film that toxic fans poopooed all over before it even came out.
the second half was woke with a light touch of mary sue.the first half was pretty good  lots of potential.the biggest sin this movie commits in my eyes is that while it was nice that they spent so much time invested in getting comanche culture as accurate as possible by today s standards  it would have been nice if they paid even a tenth of the same effort researching the yautja predator culture since its the main character of not just the movie  but the franchise.in order to make the main character seem more capable and strong they had to create what has to be the most stupid predator Ive ever seen on camera  walking into every scratch  bite  arrow  spear  spike  bullet and trap within a 5 mile radius. acts more like nemesis or mr x from resident evil games.
Im a massive predator fan Ive even written my own spec screenplay for a predator film in the past. not even I wish to watch this movie. lol
the first 30 minutes wasn t woke.
like you   tighten up vid.   this is more a 6 to 8 min vid at most
miss verses at the end of video.
p.s... luv ya. have for years.  sincerely trent simons
where is the butter
I liked this movie  it was fun as an action movie  but I have some issues with it. we need to understand that a predator is a warrior  a big  strong being that comes from a civilation of a culture that is alot about hunting and that is very good at warfare in any form. so  a teenage girl getting the best of a predator is not realistic in any shape or form. and she doesent care of anyone or anybody  shes a real brat  only she is importent. no feelings when most ofher  male tribe is taken out. and not many feelings when her brother dies and after.  then she gets home and is the best ever  made warrior chief and there is no males anywhere. only women matter itseems. in this time of human history  yeah right ! no ! its not anywhere near the greatness of the first predator movie and will never be ! they missed the beat with this one  again.... stop using teenage girls in all movies and shows  please !!!
so tina  but with predators lol. jk  love the channel and the hair. big fan!
reddit is full of milk drinker losing their minds because not everyone lives this movie  calling everyone sexist
back in that day girls did belong in the kitchen.
because they were encouraging indigenous girls to rebel  and to be a little historically accurate.
would you prefer if she was depicted like captain marvel  2020 mulan  or rey skywalker
@ m nlamb  heck no. I prefer to give her the ripley connor treatment of character arc.
@rampaiger ren   which character arc start from being a damsel to badass like sarah connor or start as a badass from beginning to end like ellen ripley
@ m nlamb  why not both.
@rampaiger ren  because the sarah  connor character needed 2 films to complete.the ellen ripley character arc is cool but doesnt work in the modern climate people will just say its  strong wemen  instead of just enjoying the film.if a great film like  alien  came out in modern time they would shit on it before it hit the theaters.
@ m nlamb  yep  thats exactly what Im getting at here. but still  Im the minority of  anti-woke  enjoying this over amazon s lotr crap!!
blasphemy! the orginal predator is top tier.
prey is absolutely not better than the original. its not even better than predators
@dg  k
@hometownzero  bet you haven t even seen predator 2. practical fx beat cgI every single time. whatever enjoy your modernity
@fritz the cat  I have seen every single predator movie more than once.
I can see what you mean  in my opinion  the original is a better film.but  prey  is absolutely my favorite predator film in the franchise  the predator is shown more than any previous predator film.it had back the agility of the 1st predator with the tankiness of the 2nd predator.this film was perfect for me.
@fritz the cat  yeah thatscene where the predator summoned lighting out of nowhere looked great right how about the smoke and cloak effects inside the predator ship  they looked great right
everything after the first 30 minutes was woke.
I liked it  it was fun
I hate all the woke shit in the movie world today but man I thought this movie was fun man.
I thought the movie was fine. wasn t great  but at the same time it wasn t terrible.
it was ok but things like  because you think I cant  made me want to throw up
I would pay to see melonie mac fight a predator in the wild. that women only eats butter she can survive anywhere
not woke  she learned as she went and earned what she got. good movie. should have leaned into the horror with thatscary a     silent hill  looking predator design
I wonder if those who made this movie and chose the comanche realize that the comanche were empire builders and drove other tribes off their land.....probably not.
I didn t get the white man bad vibe cuz they were french so  also I liked the movie could ve been better but I liked it worth a watch.I didn t like the pred mask tbh though.
just get on with it
the final fight scene had me thinking  ...bro  seriously ! noooob!   iykyk
it was perfect
the native americanthing was so badly done and so historically inaccurate  its only redeeming feature was being able to laugh at it. the cgI was even worse and that predator  its a case to each their own but this was crap. p.s. I watched it with the sound off and still haven t seen it with sound  I recommend it that way.
the bear scene is stupid. bears dont spot a human from 500 yards and decide they re gonna go fuck them up. they will either ignore you or literally run away. and if they do attack its almost always because you were too close to their cubs.
p r o m o s m
yeah  those french trappers seemed right out of pirate of the caribbeans with their looks and behavior. also barely one decent french accent amongts them.the heroine was indeed weak character wise  basically a disney princess type wanting  more .other than that  good flick.
some people even said that the real comanche women in history are not warriors  they re just there to be wives and cooking. go figure
Imostly liked it  maybe a little too much acrobatics for me. I just dont see native americans being that  trained  200 years ago  but Imay be wrong.
non-woke movie would have had her hunting from a small age with her dad...then her dad is killed by the predator then she uses her skills to kill the predator.
melonie if you like alien and predator movies  you should check out guyver dark hero on youtube.he is my favorite superhero.
woke cringe for me  I saw it  no anymore.
except her little exposition towards the end. that was kind of cringe.
bahaha Im ready!
what prey taught me is that if you pick up a weapon  you only have to fail once and then you can become an expert at it. you will never fail to use it again from that point on.
@imperial walker  expert  she shot him point blank..
prey has no logic
not theatrical level but straight to netflix type of movie like sharknado
I dont even mind that they made her the lead  I think making everything so grounded and accurate is boring. I just wish they wrote her better.
all comanche knows is to wrestle  not parkour everywhere.
that would be awesome! what we have in prey was bad writing.
or her and the brother teaming up against it.
if you dont know jacknabout this franchise dont review it
was it woke yes  was it in your face insulting not really  the movie was ok
your not eating butter!!!!
you tube wont load this video  and this video only   for me.....  any other video is playing fine for me right now.... idk
the predator was cool. but all the rest was stupid.
im just sad they didnt speak the real language like in the apocalypto. seeing native americantribe speaking english is the most cringe inducing stuff in this movie
Godzilla wins Godzilla wins Godzilla wins
not to mention she would never be a hunter in her tribe. ever. no women are allowed to do so.
people using the phrase woke yet not knowing what it means. the fragile folk didn t like seeing native americans on screen. good to have a strong female character. some reason this channel pops up in the recommendations.
I dont at all feel it was woke since they kept all the birthers with silent background rolls and only gave speaking lines to the men and the lead teen. but it was not a good movie at all.
Im glad its ok. Im just not into the whole female victim mentality. right me an actual female and il gladly shower it with dosh.its just all to formulaic.
I thought it was a ok movie  could have been great movie without all the woke shit  definitely would not pay to see it. it was well made but damn  a lot of plot armor.
it was fantastic..  woke  is dumb overused term
the only good predator movie was the 1st they got progressively worse by each 1 after
what s interesting is that this film s concept of indigenous people fighting invaders reminds me of 2007 s pathfinder with karl urban. thatshould have been a predator film  not this garbage.
the redesign of the predator is absolutely terrible looking. how do you mess up a classic iconic alien design like that. but anyway there s only have three predator movies worth watching 1 and 2 and predators. the alien vs predator movies are a abomination just like the redesign in this movie.
this entire woke think is stupid.  if alien or aliens was released today we would have tons of people saying its woke.  its stupid.  this was not the best movie in the world but its definitely better than the trash they put out last time.
why people keep saying that its  woke   obviously its not the first female protagonist in films  nor the first indian nat american protagonist in films.well  except if the main character is a non binary  four armed chinese dwarf with nine split personalities. now that  is woke.
my whole thought at the end is. sometimes the bad guy wins. there s nothing you can do about when you make the villain so op. I had a hard time even liking this movie. at the end you cantell they had to dumb down the predator strength  speed  agility and fight skills to help her win. it wasn t a good movie. had to giv it a 0 10
thank you for saying it  I got torn to shreds on r predator for even suggesting the movies a little bit woke
a. Im native american b. almost virtually no one saw the  native cast as a negative thing  idiots just make up racism where it doesnt exist to deflect valid criticismc. happy my vid got recommended lol
me to
@theenchiladakid  place is a hive mind nobody there wants to have an actual conversation.you either loved the film or youre guilty of wrongthink.
hImelonie just watch bulletrain its way better than prey no wokeness brad pitt is good in it
the animal scenes were sooo retarted. lions and bear models were rendered like shit  their movements were soo fake  and sounds were laughable lol.  hollywood always butchers anything to do with hunting. they used like a tiger vocal for the cougar   and to hunt it they didnt bring the dog  dogs are the only way you cantrack cougars to then tree and shoot them .. thatstuff was just as tone deaf as the acting lol.. predator was pretty cool tho
I thought it was poachers bad not white men bad thing
indian yentle.and I cared more about the dogs than the humans.
I have hated every predator related movie after the second film. this is the only one that intrigued me. not perfect by any means but a step in the right direction
it was just meh. the predator moments were cool and the dog was the best character.
for those who call this woke really have no clue about movies . female action stars have been around since the 70 s   y all forgot halloween alien  long kiss goodnight  fifth element etc etc etc
to sum up the entire review  its mediocre.
I dont know about woke. but when I saw the girl with a chip on her shoulder in the first trailer...the movie was a hard pass for me. its bad enough to have to deal with these people in my work life. I dont need the same shit in my free time.
its not woke imo. or alien is woke  terminator 1 is  woke. its the best predator movie in a long time and its a masterpiece compared to the predator. that turd wasn t woke and itsucked ass anyway.
the movie was bad. cringey bad. the concept was good  the look was good  but the mary sue is downright terrible. even my son who loves predator admitted that its awful even though it was the movie he looked forward to the most.
stick to eating butter and leave off the reviews please
it looks awful. gonna pass.
too much political correctness to enjoy it.  they should have gone with a comic series.  the predator franchise needs to go back to show how the predator follows a code of conduct and honor in the hunt and shows respect to humans when they prove a worthy opponent.
the brother and the dog were the only likeable characters
absolutely nothing woke about this movie. americans and your woke   non woke nonsense. just watch the film for what it is. this movie is fantastic. and as someone who was actually around back when the first one came out and still to this day have the vhs of it. I can say for sure this better than the first one. I bet most people thatshoot this movie down are young people that are used to cgI driven substance less string of crap super hero movies that are so fantastic to them.
there is nothing  woke  about this film!
lol their just native ther not trying to do anything u rather them be american and white and familiar to you the second their not there t trying to do something different your extremely bias review  your like pick me for white rep men like tomI luraen of youtube channel bye girl
its both. its actually a great film until the predator has a choke hold on her. that was the woke  part.
okay.. youre going to disagree with me but... I didn t like the movie and I didn t think it was a good predator movie... because the creature in my book is not a predator  and my reasons are that dan trachtenberg stated in an interview that when designing the thing  he told his concept artist to start off with a creature that visually and conceptually was not a predator  and they had to reel that back until it became something which resembled a predator.so to me... the whole sub-species angle just is a poor  poor excuse. its no excuse.and feral was stupidly incompetent. if the jungle hunter was able to see barely visible trip wires in the jungle  with a mask that had no alternate visual modes... then how the hell did feral miss a bear trap that was in the middle of a flat plains field  and right when he had naru in his grasp  why didn t he snap her neck  and for a hunter who had all this gear  only to get killed by it... did he not know how his own gear worked if you ask me  the movie is okay as its own thing but not a predator movie and its just being blown way out of proportion.5 10 is my rating...
thankfully brad pitt doesnt talk about his political leanings that much.
@                         he been very vocally left leaning but is not crazy woke
@james h u r l e y  I bet he s rethunk some things after his split with jolie
watched it the other day. definitely a fun movie.
@james h u r l e y  he s very liberal  but I haven t heard him talk politics for a while. some other actors just dont know when to give it a rest.
@justin carloz maxino   its weird  cause her father is a full-blown conservative.
so predator being dumb as shit all movie so that the protagonist wont get killed is a step in the right direction
I agree with you  the dog more than earned its paycheck.
the antI woke crowd and sjw crowd are super annoying here
so the guys looked wimpy while the girl looked beefy yet another reason Im skipping this movie.  I d say 2 was the best predator sequel
a woman in a lead role in a film  the tin foil hat brigade will always label it as  woke  before they have even watched it. I feel sorry for them.
prey is woke disney garbage and the most overrated movie of 2022 so far. the shills saying it is the best since the original or even better than the original is pure bs. prey is not even on the same level as predator 2 or predators which wasn t even that bad to begin with let alone the original. its a female feminist empowerment movie and a karen s wet dream.
not woke  just broke. she proves herself to some corpses  thatshe is responsible for their stiffness. ignoring actual historic culture  to preach about the current mythology that prevails in today s imagination. not missing anything if you miss this crap. garbage with some good action shots. not much worse than the awful other sequels. definitely a self insert fantasy for the writer.
I dont think I like a white girl saying woke  its cringey.
am I supposed to be impressed
what a disgusting review  specially with that annoying voice and the word  woke.  such a poor writing  and poor point of view.
plus in the comanche nation  there would have never been a female hunter.  sorry. stop trying to place present day ideas and perspectives on a nation that is over 300 years old.
dont like what a white  native girl has to say then maybe dont click on her channel. appreciate the view and comment tho
