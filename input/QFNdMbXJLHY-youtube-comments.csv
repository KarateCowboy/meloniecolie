not every movie story needs diversity.   thank you for stating what really should be common sense but for some reason isn t in this nonsensical world we now live in.  if you have to  see yourself  in everything you watch  thats called narcissism.
its almost funny  they absolutely nailed the casting for geralt and they still managed to fuck it up. we should really admire the ability of these disconnected writers and directors to make shit out of gold  its a skill in itself.
let henry cavill act in and direct the witcher.
as a man with a degree in creative writing  I can confirm that these people were the ones in my classroom that never took any kind of constructive criticism. I love constructive criticism. this is all to say  sadly  they probably have creative writing degrees.
personally speaking henry cavill is the only reason why I bothered watching this series to begin with. I gave up after season 2 when I realized he wasn t in it much. I dont think that a petition will change much. lol
im finally proud of humanity  the fact that we managed to get 140k people sign the petition is insane
I feel bad for henry  the writers must have been really bad.
speaking as a fan. Im fine with henry not returning. everyday  henry was working with toxic group of people. people who hates what henry loves and passionate about. because the writers will never be fired and clearly the director is okay with them. instead of suffering while staying with those people  the best option is to leave.I played the 2 and 3rd games and I have an encyclopedia of withcher monsters.
I literally laugh every time melonie brings up lara tr in unrelated videos.
cavill needs to find people who actually care to helm the shows or movies they direct. but not just on an individual scale. he needs to start networking and finding as many people who feel as passionate about the source material as him.
I almost never sign these petitions as they are ignored  but ill do this one  mainly because I want the showrunners writers to know how badly they messed up. better yet  everyone cancel their netflix after the release of season 3.
props  melonie   for the shout out to  crouching tiger  hidden dragon.  that movie had a hugely positive impact on me broadening my taste in movies and literature.and you know what  I ain t chinese. but I didn t have to see any black irish american indians in it for it to make my list of best movies of all time.
the witcher tv show needs to be written by people who love the original stories  and carnivores. thats the key.
even though it likely wont work  petitions like this are still important since they let fan opinions be known to a wider audience. and they let the studios know what the audience wants - even if the studios do nothing about them now they cant claim that they dont know what the fans want or that the fans want something else. so Im going to sign even though I dont watch the show  lol. Imean  I would have watched if I hadn t already heard bad things about the writing and some acting  eg triss .
I ll say this as a positive  cavill leaving and demayo s words about the writers have shown how much of a crap show the witcher netflix series is. but I dont want cavil to come back. even if they replaced the writers  the damage has been done with the first two seasons and really henry doesnt need the series  its the other way around.  they took advantage of cavill and worse  there were showrunners who hated the source material. something I cant even fathom. you wouldn t have a job if the source material didn t exist! so really  I get the intention but I think its best to pack it up with cavill being apart of the witcher. they wasted his talents and the material presented. let them lie in their bed.
he s been fighting with the producers for years and they didn t even cared about the original works and he found out they even mocked the original story.after years of that and superman comes by get the heck off thatshow and go do you!glad to see him going someplace that will make him happy and not stressed out
would love to see this happen  but no way. only significant financial pain is going to force studios to change. the deeper their pockets  disney  amazon  the longer it will take. sad decade we are in for entertainment
itsucks because he did such a good job at the role. same looks  voice pretty much.
henry cavill is a beast and very underappreciated as an actor.
I dont think cavill is going to come back. you are so right  it is so hard to find good shows that aren t insufferable.  forehead smack . like family matter  I liked thatshow and I didn t need to see myself in it to enjoy the show. love the video  love ya mel. stay strong. and bless you melonie.
there s nothing wrong with diversity in a series or movie as long as it doesnt involve race or gender swapping.
@tim trozzo  exactly
not just that  if there is   diversity  how about shut up about it and dont make it the whole promotion of a show    oh the first black dwarf ever in  Lord of the rings wow!!!! and then shes paraded around as being some nobel peace prize winner!!
the problem is when they put more emphasis on diversity than in writing the story  characters and hiring good actors
can we get a re boot of animorph s
also if youre somehow unable to see yourself in a person unless they hold your skin color  kinda makes you the racist no  idk Ive never attributed skin color to if the character is relatable or not personally alot of people seem to do so though.
they re the same calibur of writers as the game of thrones group. good at adaptations  which is why they were picked probably  but useless at copying style and making new things fit into the lore and spirit of the show. as soon as they created new content the difference was apparent.
this is how idiocracy works  politicians do it the same way - they care only about their paycheck and how to make it last... when the recipe is so simple  just let people to thrive and you ll be rich with them!and I was hoping for them to wake up somehow through 2 seasons to make 3rd better - if henry says its a dumpsterfire  so I ll go along with him  p
the crazy thing is geralt wasn t just perfect casting for the way he looks  that he talks like geralt or acts like him. he s a dedicated fan! as I witcher lore nerd I admit we can be annoying. but if you listen to people like us and cavill who s been saying on set  do this  do that  you would make so much money!
they dont have money for henry.
if he wasn t a dedicated fan he probably wouldn t be a good geralt. he is a bit too classically good looking and I am not sure he is a natural fit  but he tries very hard to create the image  voice  details  etc. cavill should be commended much like jackman with wolverine  acting above and beyond not only to fit the character to the best of their ability  but also  advocating on behalf of the fans and source material. cavill has made me a fan.
@austin jt  that wasn t a problem before  so I doubt it would be now - cavill wanted to be his beloved hero  so he took the role and deal with netflix. they just screwed up this all the way  so he left  and I did with him.what a pity  because tv series made real change in reach of this franchise - now its just an eggshell...
thats what wokeness does  destroy everything that has quality.
100  nailed it there beanz!!
@escape gulag  awake  being alert   being in a state of readiness  being active. nonwoke  asleep  non active  brain dead.
a fantasy setting based upon medieval poland and its lore  if Im not mistaked  is somehow more diverse than modern day poland. funny that. imagine if we made a show based upon ancient africa and its lore and then inserted a bunch of white people for the sake of  diverstiy  and to make it for a  modern  audience  me thinks their tone would be far different.
@tim trozzo  I agree there is nothing wrong with as long as its not shoehorned in just for the sake of checking the representation box.
@jared francis  for sure. think back to all those times they cried about supposed  white washing  a good example is iron fist. they claimed white washing however iron fist was always a white man.
@creatorsfreedom!!!  gosh I wish  with today s animation it would have such epic potential for the morphs and hork-bajir taxxons.....but Im worried they d ruin it with some political statements or another. its got the natural diversity  but I feel they wouldn t think that was enough
@tim trozzo  I agree that is why I refused to watch the new interview with the vampire tv series.
@jared francis   according to netflix lore  and problably books  but I read them a while ago  people were sucked throught some random weird portals and appeared in witcherland on the continent during conjunction of the spheres. why were only white people taken  are the portals selective for skin colour or what
@chcetok3ny  wrong  the conjunction of sphere is what brought unnatural creatures into the world  like vampires and such. the setting itself is based around medieval poland. there are other nations within this world but the area in which the main story takes place is based on poland.
they had a diamond and they threw it out...
they didn t nail it  henry did. he literally pestered his managers non stop so that they contact netflix and book an audition. he was so excited about the witcher being made into a show and wanted to be in itso much that he didn t stop until they casted him as geralt.so  not even that is their merit. lol
he can join amazon s upcoming fallout show instead  he likes fallout too.
toss a coin to your witcher
@commando 385  what fallout next  so another one to skip as if they would make a good series out of it will be like resident evil ohh im so sick of this shit. its like hollywoke wants that anime kills them all!!!chainsaw man newest destroyer
directing isn t the problem its the writing! the writers dont care about the source material unlike cavill who has stressed its importance in most interviews.
@1chasg  the director allows that writing bro. that woman always talked about the witcher but did not care
good idea! capital idea  in fact.
@Christian isea  you are talking about the showrunner  not the directors. the show had multiple directors. the showrunner lauren schmidt allowed that writing.
its just frustrating because he already has to do his job and act  its idiotic we are even having the conservation that an actor needs to do the job of a director  showrunner  and writer.
@samuel aritan  it is sad he had to be the be the one teaching the writer and director about the lore  thats not how itshould be. and without him to guide the direction  what now
let him write it too  garauntee its better
@chris m  it would be easy. all he has to do is bring a copy of the books and tell everyone to read it  and put that on screen.
@c j  I think the death scene of roach was so powerful because it was the death of the story he was lamenting. he is the king of the nerds deservedly so  I used to say it as a joke  but he defends the lore  respects the fandom  and attempts to do the story justice. and our myths and stories have been so violated and the fans so gaslit and so attacked that his actions at this point are acts of bravery  because standing up to these people could get him blacklisted. at this point he needs to step back and watch it burn  to highlight how much he did attempt to right the ship. because all the defenses he attempted will be completely stripped away now that he s gone and remove the veil entirely.
@samuel aritan  yeah  I know they said they were initially going to make the roach scene comedic. geralt would never find humor in the death of an innocent living creature. even the monsters  he goes out of his way to make sure he doesnt take contracts on innocent ones as part of his code.  they are completely out of touch with who geralt is. without henry I think the shows version of geralt will be unrecognizable.
yes  of course henry cavill was perfect casting and they should have done more to keep him and get writers that would respect  canon. but the milk is spilled. I dont have any reason to believe that liam hemsworth will not do this role justice. the issue is still the writers irrespective of the actors. and unlike rop I dont have any issues with the acting in the witcher. for the casual viewer not familiar with the books or game it is still entertaining and appears to be well made. looking forward to season 3 at least and then we ll have to wait and see.
@michelle miles  its not so much about liam hemsworth s quality as an actor. its that henry cavill actively had to question and confront the writers on multiple occasions in order to represent geralt correctly on screen. I doubt liam hemsworth will approach the role with as much fervor. its not something thatshould be expected of an actor  but nonetheless  I think the quality of geralts representation will suffer.
no no no  just make him an actor and producer  so he has full control of the bullshit the writers pull
@mr.coolhats  that works too.
yes  forget about superman. he s way better as the witcher
but this will never happen!  its time to say good by to the witcher series. and let us all hope the best for the witcher 1 game remake... because they also want  reimagination  for the modern audience... they could destroy it like the last of us...
@sabsI noname  what modern audience. its stupid every time something is made for a modern audience. its like declaring the current audience dead.
even if he came back which I hope he will  they d need to create some comvuluted way to bring eskel back  or make it as if season 2 was an entire fever dream  because there s no way they can write themselves out of the narrative chasm they threw the story into when they killed one of the pivotal characters in the books for the sake of subverting expectations
@ithamar lowe  modern audience  past audience  all audiences want a good product.
facts
@rogue poison  there is not only the  eskel problem  there are so many more... the writers would never admit it  like in rings of power. they will say its absolutely great...again and again and... the whole second season was a mess in my opinion. sirI as a demon.... kills a bunch of witcher  yennifer... I am afraid of watching the third one.
perhaps gender studies major with a creative writing minor.
yes some writers just suck or want to be clowns in a circus.
he s likable in person  he s very good looking obviously  he s a very diverse actor and can do a lot of rules but he s actually really good in this role as well. I did not like the show  I thought it was incredibly popular  so Im glad to know other people were bored. but his performance is awesome and I would never have bothered watching one more minute that I did without him
same  it would have been far worse without him
personally  Im still gonna try to slog through season 3 at some point  but it really did seem like they sidelined the main character in favor of the female protagonists and it felt like they were starting to get a little woke preachy at times.
true that  he brought that character to life
petitions aint shit. only cavill made the witcher worth a viewing but I found it very boring and didn t even watch season 2.
let this show die. even with henry they dont care about the witcher at all
@Christian isea  I d rather let the show have new writers than die  like it or not a witcher tv show has a lot of potential  think of how much lore and characters are in the book  it just all depends on how its all executed
but henry chose to leave  prolly to focus on superman. let him do what he wants
well  its not gonna change shit
@perkyblue  he wouldnt leave a show he campaigned so hard for and who has proven he loves the character  world and story of the books for a return at a character hes played multiple times already. the quality of the writing team is what made him walk away and he just chose the easy choice of going back to superman. he wouldve left even if he didnt get offered to return as superman.
@Christian isea  - we should at least make an attempt before throwing in the towel. 140k signatures in a week is actually pretty impressive. at then very least it makes it perfectly clear as to exactly why the show failed  so the slimeball writers couldn t claim its for a different reason or call the fans hateful.well they could  but it would obviously be a lie at that point.
its 208k now  they are aiming for 300k.
Ive been in gross activist environments before and I cantotally understand if thats the case for him then I do not blame him  that environment is extremely gross and it feels like your dignity and soul is slowly slipping away from your being  and the worst part is they like doing gross shit like ruining pure and beautiful thing s  they have malicious intent from the very beginning and they openly admit with pride that they enjoy doing shit like this when no one is looking  honestly the grossest of individuals in this day and age
dude. play the first game. it looks old  sure  but its great peace of storytelling especially when you pay attention to dialogues  even those that are potentially not important.
@greydeathvaccine  I did. right after the prologue the game kept crashing on my pc. I tried looking for the issue but there s no error code to complain the issue to. so I just moved on to the 2nd game.
thank you for your existence. I totally agree with your opinion  Im also happy about his exit from the series. henry  really needs to stay away from toxic people and people that may hurt him
lol
cavill   diesel productions who finish up the riddick series then acquire the rights to produce a harbingers  valiant comics  movie
@bruce maximus  not bad  not bad  I think it would be cool if he got bankrolled by stallone  gibson  or arnold to do a gritty warhammer space marine movie. have gibson help direct  use sly and arnold for talent acquisition   production. henry cavill and alan ritchson as two of the leads and let cavill co-produce with lore master written into contract.edit  hell  even rope in eastwood into it for writing and script oversight.
I cancelled a year ago  but I ll keep it cancelled and sign this thing anyway.
I cancelled after they revealed the cast prior to season 1.
Imean I wasn t watching to begin with because the story is so Goddamn confusing in the first season that I came out of it understanding geralts story and the world of the witcher less than after playing the game. like no doubt caville was the major strong point of the show and without him I dont think anyone would even be talking about this show lol
as an asian  is it discrimination if I dont want to see asians in alien  haha
@silent cerberus  I honestly dont know  but I wouldn t imagine so.
imagine if wakanda had a  diverse population ......and why not  asguard apparently does despite being of norse methodology.
@m  yeah. dont get me started on that one.  a highly diversified skin-tone palette is apparently mandatory  unless the name of your country starts with  w  and ends in  akanda   then the diversity quota checklist goes out the window.   critical drinker
as a long time kungfu fan  honestly I dont get what so great about crouching tiger...its almost like the ones who praises itso much never seen any other kungfu movies other than bruce lee s work.. and I failed to see aman chow as a kungfu master  he s too ingrained in my brain as a gambler  a cop or some triad member
hah! I commented roughly the same thing. let this woke iteration die off  then hope for better efforts from someone in the future.
its not so grim. no need to be over dramatic.
how does itsuck  the show kept getting worse anyways  I dont see how him staying in the same role would make things better
I have one word for you  u.n.c.l.e.
hey  tbh  I wounldn t be opposed to more melonie. but I know you dont have time for that. always good to see you. here for ya. youre my fav content creator.
I feel the same way about fresh prince growing up
good to see you melonie!
fiction is meant to entertain us through imagination thatseparates us from the real world. something we can enjoy with an open mind and without strict ideals. not everything has to be relatable  if itsomehow is  then thats great! but perfectly said melonie  if it is forced  it will be noticeable and less attractive to the many. keep doing your thing girl! great channel and great job!
sad really   we need more people like henry that are willing to say no and quit a great role because they re not honoring the character . 100  agree with you .
I gotta say  the more I learn about this the more I give props to cavill. the fact that he s a fellow nerd like us and he goes and disagress with the character development and how they dont respect the source material tells me a lot  good on him..
I am happy for cavill. he stood by what he loves and followed through with it. I doubt the writers would be fired  because thats how the world is. as much as I loved seeing cavill as geralt  him being happy and doing what he wants is more important. mad respect for the guy.
this has been going on for decades. some narracist is hired to adapt something  thinks they are way smarter than the original writer and change everything to what they think is better. then they expect people to go  oh wow  you made itso much better  youre so great and talented! all these streaming services  all this content being made  all these positions open for writers  means more and more talentless hacks have an opportunity to fail upwards.
even if what s done is done  a fandom standing up and voicing their love for an actor in a role by sheer merit  despite the show being what it was speaks volumes. cavill embodied the character and outclassed the show itself by caring about the authenticity and embracing the role properly despite the writers.
Im not much of a gamer but I wanted to at least read some of the books before I started watching the show. Ive always been like that- I even read the fault in our stars before the movie came out even though I despise ya romance how foolish of me to think that they d stick to the source material.
unfortunately changing the writer s wont do much. the showrunner herself is the one who wanted to stray away from the source material. so she would be the one who needed to go. but season 2 already went so far away from source  and we haven t even seen 3 yet . there may be no way to actually course correct this  period
mel mel! I believe cavil left because a fan of anything will be able to tell who isn t a real fan. then he seen his opportunity with playing super again or was approached by the rock and took that as a  hey Im sorry guys but Im going to go in a different venture  thanks for everything  . I strongly believe he wanted to be done with the show the moment he picked up on a few people not liking the thing they are writing for. maybe he talked to people about it and trued to reason with them  but like you said. whats done is done. could he make a cameo  yes. I dont think that would be to crazy.
9 02 when I was young  I watched family matters and the cosby show.  it never bothered me that there were no cast members of my ethnicity  I dare say I dont think I even noticed .  if one needs someone to be physically similar to himself to sympathize and emotionally connect with a character  that is a pitiable state.
if they drop the showrunner and writers and just have cavil run and write it  Imay watch again.
imma just say it - you can carry on at your own pace. its your own channel  you can upload as often as you like about whatever the heck you wanna chat. your content is awesome
they re putting the cart in front of the horse and asking the wrong thing. they should be making a petition to fire and replace everyone working in the series that doesnt respect and love the source material and replacing them with people who do. only then should cavill return.
cavill did state that he would continue playing geralt as long as they stayed true to the source material and respected it. the writers are idiots for pretty much making him leave. I respect henry for doing so because he just wanted to best the best geralt but the writers wont let him  so he left. in my opinion.
the possible plus to henry moving on is that the income from a few more superman spots may fund his passion project in the warhammer universe.  actors careers do sometimes jump to writing and directing.
henry brought credibility to the show  and his portrayal of geralt in season 1 was perfect. too bad the writers weren t satisfied. I heard season 2 was bad so I skipped it. Ive learned not to get too attached to shows. they either get ruined or cancelled
totally agree with you  I signed the petition  but unfortunately feel its already too late.
I love your channel so much!  you ve earned my sub. as a Christian gamer and l0tr fan  for me its a deep intellectual  moral and cultural breath of fresh air!  youre breath-taking!        I bought the last wish book and played through the main campaign of wild hunt just because of henry cavill s convictions to the books. I agree in that I think there is no point in henry trying to go back to netflix and bandage things up after this bogus ruse. this is exactly what happened with halo 5. they literally hired people that hated halo  same thing with the new halo show too. so glad I found this channel.
you nailed it!... they know what they are doing and doing it intentionally... they honor it and make it great at the start  to get you hooked paying for it... then they do the switch on us  on purpose  and if anyone stops watching or dares complains... they are bigots..we re going to see season 3 go farther away from the source material which is where hc being intelligent didn t want his name attached to it after realizing where it was going.  season 4-7 is going to make rop look like a historic retelling in comparison... probably gonna end up with geralt and jaskier having an intimate relationship 3-way with yennifer by season 6 and I wish I was joking...
oh and I love it when you bring up tomb raider in your videos melonie
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners    .
same deal with rings of power  they can say they ll course correct and be more close to the source but there are fundamental foundations which once broken cant be repaired.
@nathaniel perry  I concur with both of you. even the parts of the books they got  right   which they really didn t  were butchered for no good narrative reason.
yeah but imagine the majority of the shows you watched being like family matters and the cosby show. I can guarantee they weren t.
@josh cramer  why wouldn t I expect the demographics of the majority of shows to reflect the majority of the nation in which they are made   why dont you go complain about too many indians in bollywood
@photriuspyrelus  and see how it feels now  with the shoe on the other foot...thats the big picture  right there
@josh cramer  75.8  Im pretty sure under any definition that is a majority.  but dont let silly things like facts get in the way of your narrative  my dude.
this would be epic.
getting closer to 100 000 subs! well deserved. love your videos.
this conflict between cavill and the writers makes all the sense in the world when you compare season 1 with season 2.  I can only imagine what a shitshow season 3 will be.
its too late for those fans. the producers will hopefully learn from their choices to insert their views of modern society into a show that is based on europe s past.
as much as I want him back I dont think he ll be back maybe the directors and showrunners but its difficult to see him back but there s still a chance things could change
to be honest he is back as superman  so that will always be more important to him. but if he said he is gone after season 3 then they must have really screwed up...
bro tried all he could! as far as I cantell he chose to leave. for very obvious reasons. I couldn t make it through 2 episodes of season 2. Im not gonna demand the poor guy go back to that nightmare  go  be free  henry! I dont blame you one bit!
I agree with you what s done is probably done. but firing the writers and getting henry back would save their show.
I fuckin love your videos.you definitely got a cool vibe to you.
to be fair  by the time this wonderful man  henry cavill  gets done building his on pc  playing the games he wants to play on his custom built pc  working out to look amazing for his roles  and filming his new and future superman roles... that doesnt leave much time to visit rivia
he needs to be a co-show-runner.
I checked out the petition. right next to this one was one to have terry crews play ciri. thats hilarious. I hope they do a parody with him doing it.
openly mocking or straight up disrespecting the source material seems to be the norm among writers and producers these days. I dont know where they re finding these so-called writers but they ll know soon enough their bread and butter is the fans and once you piss off the fanbase no more bread and butter.
up to 150k now! a year ago I d have said they d take no notice but now post rings of power and several other high profile flops netflix might just take notice.it may be too late to keep cavil  but they may make some changes in writing and production
00 10 yes  it is very logical indeed. because its clearly obvious that hc and his portrayal of geralt is excessively more important to the series and the brand  than its ignorant non-lore-loving writers who were mistakenly hired for this show and for the wrong reasons apparently.  great video melonie!
Im not gonna touch netflix with a 10-inch barge pole
henry cavill is geralt and what made witcher great was his respect for the source material and passion to bring geralt to the screen.
meloniemac .... the issue is simply that most writers didn t see themselves doing these weekly cereal type shows... book writers wanted to write the next great american novel  story writers wanted to have a epic movie to create and write for... they are their for a paycheck and the only hope is to add a few lines or scenes that they can brag   thats mine...
hImelonie I always enjoy listening to your thoughts  opinions.the writers need go away.
preach it  melonie!
they dont know the lorethey dont know the canonthey dont know the source material they dont read the books they dont know the characters nothing
facts
thank you so much!
which show are we talking about  you ll need to be more specific.
the witcher she-hulk rings of power halo lol this is a big problem nowadays.
@cubist  obviously all the shows.
funny enough  140k people is about the total audience they are going to have now that henry isn t a part of it.
I would like an elric of melnibon  series. except not netflixthe reason why there isn t one   its too much like the wicher . laughable if you know the history of both
cavill was the only reason I tuned into this show.
the fact that they didn t go all in on the cirI geralt arc but instead focused on  mah wahmen  for season 2 was the first sign.  soo much potential  ruined once again by the message
I signed it.  wish even more people did.
since henry cavill s a passionate fanboy but an extremely polite guy Im gonna say it for him  the condition for him to return to the role is to get every single person fired  and to retcon the first 3 seasons into a bad hangover or something.
netflix tries to pride itself on having something for everyone. foriegn shows and nonwoke shows pay for them to make shows that aren t faithfully to the source material and until they have have a  significant drop in subscriptions  they will continue their present business model.
just signed the petition myself.
9 12 if I want to see myself I will look in a mirror. I have my own flaws not reflected in the  perfect looking  actresses of my ethnicity onscreen.this petition is too late and wont bring henry back. I really want to read the books now though.
I think its more likely that a million unicorns comes flying out of the sun singing ob-la-di-ob-la-da  than cavil returning to the witcher.
wait  did that article say  seasons to follow   bold of them to assume there will be more than one after liam takes over.
fire the writers.  thats not a bad idea at all. writing has become so bad that I really believe that most fans could come up with better stories than these hack hollywood writers do.
3 words  dont. hire. activists.
if he were to return  he s going to have to make that work with his dc schedule now  since he s officially back as superman.
lets gooo!!! sign that petition baby!!!
personally  Im still gonna try to slog through season 3 at some point  but in season 2  it really did seem like they sidelined the main character in favor of the female protagonists and it felt like they were starting to get a little woke preachy at times. it really is a shame after the first season story telling mechanisms brought the separate storylines of character development together so well in the season finale and spawned that catchy viral tune  check out violet orlandI s rendition of  toss a coin to your witcher . amazing vocalist
I liked the books well book I haven t read but one of them yet. but never bothered with the show because I didn t think mordern hollywood can handle some of the complexities that were in the books.
I dont think I can watch the witcher without cavill...
question. what s the average viewer count for the witcher  Im curious how it compares to the signature count.
the fans seem to be attached to henry cavill
elric came first  by a lot. michael moorcock had elric in a short story as early as the early  60s.  pretty sure about that.  you could even speculate that grrm might have borrowed the idea of white haired  incestuous dragon riders from moorcock.
beacuse he carried the show.
Imean if you actually listen to henry in interviews after season 2 he pretty much says hes not happy with the writers choices
at least  from what rumors say  rings of power listened to fans  after the fact  and sidelined the rop showrunners and got more lore accurate writers.
sweet heart  you hit the nail on the head with this one. let s hope they listen to you.  not holding my breath though . oh  and I just sub to your channel  girlfriend.
meanwhile  frosk took a potshot at henry on twitter. someone fandoms clearly love and respect.
holly wood just needs to fire all the writers of these shows  and just hire on people who really know them  so they are not messing up these stories. I think it would be for the best for them to do that  so we can get back to having good entertainment again.
henry spoke his mind about the series and staying true to source materials  which he was a fan of. so  when the writers openly admit  they dont like and mock the source material. another bad choice by netflix as they continue down the slide to ruin.
nah Im fine with him leaving if it means he is playing super man again and hopefully bond. he s the perfect bond imho. however Im worried that if he does play bond then the writing will be so terrible that he wont be able to save it. he was fantastic in man from uncle.
not gonna happen  it d be incredibly awkward for himsounds like the stunt coordinator was his only friend there  he s always talking about him when asked about season 3
even if cavill doesnt come back  get new writers that respect and enjoy the source material.
henry has enough on his plate going forward that returning to geralt is highly unlikely no matter what happens with the show runner and writers. still  I like the statement this petition is making.
I hope this really works  the writers should be fired! if they have no respect for the source material.I really hope this all happens and henry cavill comes back! and this paves way for other movies and series to follow the books and video games closer! instead of just trying to do their own thing with no regard for the original writers.
I watched enola holmes 2 yesterday  loved cavill and as always he delivers awesome acting  they totally butchered moriarty and watson with race swapping though. Goddamn I just cant stand woke hollywood anymore  its like a freaking plague
henry cavill is so awesome in that role  the charisma on command website actually used him as the prototype for   how to look more powerful  https   www.youtube.com watch v bme90vpxu5s
I guess I like to hear more about gaming.  God of war ragnar k is coming out.  any words on these new titles   horizon forbidden west  etc.  thoughts on microsoft acquiring activision and the oppositions.  is ray-tracing a big deal.  100 gb games.  games lasting more than 40 hours.  frame rate over visuals.
not just the writers need to go though  the show runners too.
its too late. for me it was season 2 the one thatsealed its fate. season 1 was okayish... quite a few things that were red flags  but the last episode  damn... thatshould have been the highest point for geralt  had him pretty much the entire episode ill  doing nothing. it was the yennefer show through and through.so I knew season 2 was going to be the turning point for me and I did hope for a course correction but didn t come. I checked out by episode 3 or 4. cant be bothered anymore.the showrunner should be fired. whoever hired thatshowrunner should be fire. they had everything  the resources  solid source material and henry cavill. they squandered it. what a bunch of morons.
its common practice to hire people really invested and are personal fans to get a show off the ground  and then promptly fire them and replace them with npcs.
henry cavill must return everyone wants him back as geralt
at this point  the witcher needs what the mandalorian got  writers and actors who care about the ip.because if there s one thing that would save the franchise at this point  it would be a witcher episode no different than the return of jedI grandmaster luke skywalker in s2e16 of the mandalorian.and what gets me so sad about this is  things like this have been going on for 20 years  only  it used to be networks like fox that pulled crap like this  damn you  fox  for ruining firefly!  shakes fist and curses at fox in hybrid english and mandarin  when things like this happen  this is why we cant have nice things...
he probably departed to focus on superman role. the fans are right but as you said I doubt he will return even if given the opportunity.
isn t it the witcher fan  singular  after season two  if not  I suspect they ll be down to just one fan left after they release season three.
him leaving the show pretty much kills it  unless if the writing improves with the new guy coming in. this is the worst kind of pr that a show can get.
youre good people mel.
henry cavill is the only actor with balls to leave the set when they re not staying true to the comics or the video games or books
he is garlet and he care for the lore
even if the petition doesnt change anything  new writers that care about the og material and getting cavill back  its about sending a message to netflix. giving them a big warning that if they dont learn to smarten up  they ll lose money. people who signed the petition are not just saying they wont watch it  but they will cancel there s netflix subscriptions  sighting things like rings and power and got last seasons as similar examples of their anger. thats 141k people and rising saying they ll stop giving netflix money. money talks  and considering thatstarting next year  netflix is charging per profile on the same subscription  they know they are at the cap of getting new viewers and its about milking the viewers that they have. even if not every person cancels  its still a good dent. amazon didn t listen when millions of people thumb down their trailer  instead gaslighting them and now look at them scramble to fix their show   maybe netflix will learn from a more direct warning.
I was a huge fan of the new tomb raider games.  the story and lore may not be there but the gameplay is for sure.
was about to say...  you didn t watch sanford   son  what is wrong with you  ! ! !
I get why henry cavill doesnt want to return if they re going to butcher the source material.
so basically its gonna be bad and we wont get the old actor back.
new writers would need to find some crazy canonical way to fix characters who were race swapped etc. or just hard restart the show with a new actually accurate script and casting true to the source material. and for those saying  their skin color etc. was not specified in the source material or by the author  you didn t read the books  looked into what the author has said when describing the characters  and the cultural intent. its polish. the whole race swapping is the dumbest form of pandering especially if its integral to the actual story such as triss and inevitably the duchess. I d even argue that race in general is always important to a character regardless. I dont want to see ansel elgort as black panther I want a black man or any actor with a reasonably accurate skin tone  hair color  demeanor  and whatever else the role might require when being accurate. as a polish man myself I dont appreciate the woke pushing their way into a show  representative of my culture. they wouldn t be laughing about how  dumb  their now precious black panther is while changing his sister s race to white now would they.
the only way I can see cavill coming back is if netflix were to give him a massive pay. beyond that I highly doubt he wants to come back given the fact he s doing much bigger projects now.
I thought he left to go do superman fulltime.
didn t cavill leave because he wanted to  if they support him  dont try to make him do what he wouldn t enjoy.
the whole thing needs scrapping and rebooting  and recast  besides cavill   they ve done too much damage already.
loooooorreee! actually cool with cavill as witcher medieval folklore is a good fit for his style..and if he s really into the role more power to him..americans dont really have the same sensibilities ya know what I was thinking after watching  ambulance   . maybe jake gyllenhall could play superman he s got a kind of buffed up tobey mcguire look about him
given that he s going back to superman - does he have the time to do superman  witcher  and potentially james bond
why would someone want to helm or write for a show about material they didn t like   its insane.
hell  I would write or re-write any of those for free just to make them more accurate if I could... its putting salt on a wound and calling it medicine...
its not just the writers but the show runner too  she has no idea what she s doing.
ironically  it was a race swapped british show and did get really good until they hired a young writer named richard pryor.
money and self insert.
to  improve  it for  a modern audience
like melonie said  they spend so much time on their precious gender study degree that they forgot to work on their actual creativity and originality. its a mental misfire.
good for henry.  it is a good feeling to see integrity.  sadly thats rare.  henry from the outset studied the material.  he only played the game.  I think he only read the books because the show was said to be based on the books and not the game.  so why are they deviating from the books which was the direction of the show   bait and switch.  now they are going to switch in woke content.  it is good he punted.  the conclusion of the series is the end.
its truly sad that the people making these shows are the same people who bullied us for loving video games  comic books and other things they deemed  nerdy . I really hope all of these failures make people realize that they need to have the people who love the source materials create the shows movies. I love watching these shows and movies fail  but I also hate seeing the things I love destroyed by them in the process. or people like henry cavill  who genuinely loves the witcher books and games and was excited to be a part of it  lose his excitement and leave because of the people who purposely set out to destroy the source material. as a witcher super fan  I am crushed at the way netflix did the witcher show and am anxious and guarded on the witcher 1 game remake now that cdpr is doing a  modern reimagining .
these signature petitions never mean anything lol
here s a way to snub these writers  have henry cavill play elric in thatseries.  have razorfist on as the sole writer.
no cavill  no coin!
poor liam hemsworth he ll always be number 2 behind a more popular actor.
please bring back the word of the day. I really enjoyed that. God bless you and your family. duane.
no way cavill comes back after the amount of disrespect shown to the character franchise from the writers and producers. oh well. too many subjects to talk about is a great problem to have melonie. I love hearing your unfiltered opinions. have a great day.
writers   I just want to make geralt gay and trans!
they have trapped you in word games. shows and magazines have said  fans  so many times that they tricked you. a fan doesnt care if its   a critic does. a fan will fanatically eat   but a critic wont. y all aren t fans  you are critics and that is a good thing!  fan  isn t a badge of honor  its a dunce cap  an insult. dont insult yourself  critic.
liam is not a witcher fan. he is well known for spouting alot of  being a fan  of various projects when in reality he has no clue.
the heads of these companies need to find writers who are not driven by ego.   these hacks think they are better than the source in which it came from.   they want to put their own mark on these great stories.   the only mark they have left are skid marks.
why didn t they hire writers that like the games and books  this is such a weird era...
melonie  I cant spam five videos a day.thequartering  have you learned nothing  young one  I see you are not yet ready for the lesson of three youtube shorts daily.
while henry s not coming back  not even if netflix did everything they could to get him - which they wont anyway   the petition does help indicate to netflix and the producers the degree of their fuck-up. after all  the last time we saw a petition gaining support like this was the reshoot-s8-got movement....
the big problem with rings of power is not exactly bad writing. the problem is that they try to sell it as tolkien which it is not.had they instead announced rings of power as a new franchise unrelated to any existing franchise it would have been ok.thats the problem with a lot of these shows and movies actually - they try to tie it to a big franchise and then change anything that makes up the stories within the franchise.  rings of power  the witcher  wheel of time..its happening time and again. what they should do instead is develop new franchises - by doing that they cantell the stories they want to tell without pissing off the fans by butchering the source material of the various franchises. and we as viewers can enjoy the shows for what they are instead of hating them for what they should have been but are not.
not everything needs diversity  I dont watch bollywood movies or british comedies about south asians like goodness gracious me to see myself even though I am indian. I didn t watch squid games to see myself either.
short of retconning season 2  it doesnt matter who plays geralt.  they already lost the fans
witcher 1 and 2 was not bad at all
we re pretty sure that was the reason for cavill s exit from the witcher series.he s a big fan  and he said it wasn t about the dceu  so what else is there
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners    ..
henry cavill. massive fan of the witcher. gets cast as geralt  the main character  for netflix s the witcher show. show runners say they wont change anything because there s so much lore and story already told.  s1 comes out to mixed reviews because of story alterations and character black washing. only universal approval for the show.......henry cavill as geralt. s2 comes out  very different to the books. also massively changes characters entire personalities and stories  focuses  on a minor character for most of the season who goes on power trip only to be smacked down by main villain 2 seconds after he arrives. completely ruins yennefer s relationship with geralt and permanently creates a division between her and surrogate daughter cirI by trying to give her to knock off baba yagga to be killed so she can get her powers back  because of fire magic that never happened in the books  and a litany of other problems and alterations including continued black washing of white characters. only thing fans agree on.......henry cavill as geralt. writers proven to hate the books and the franchise they re writing the script for. show fires the only thing about the show that people agree on. shocker there s backlash. Imean. who could have guessed
dd 7-11-22 petition over 150.000 and climbing  I have netflix account just to see witcher expensive views indeed .
I was let down with the show but I watched it. really liked cavill in the role so I will probably watch season 3 but that will be it for me. freaking disappointing
I came for the butter and the dog and got neither
its nice and is going to be a massive ego boost for cavill but its not like he was fired he looked at his role as sups and went I just wont have time to film both there is only so much time in a given year  no one wants to work 365 days a year and to film both witcher and superman thats the kinda work load he would be looking at.I have a feeling that if cavill could have stayed with witcher and still done superman he would have done because he loves the characters as much as the fans do so he had to basically choose between his children which he likes most and sadly for use witcher lost.
they should just fire the writers anyways
100k signatures  and its not gonna change a thing. these online petitions are useless.
if not for cavil  Im not so sure I would have watched the show. I do know that 100  I wouldn t have watched the show if I didn t like the games.
even if this succeeds which it will. they have to wait till his contract with dc is done.
you know its not up to the fans  its up to henry cavill. henry wasn t fired or let go  he left on his terms. why he left ! your guess is as good as any. is it because of the writers  is it because of superman  only henry cavill knows.
I concur that the damage is done and that they need to quit while they re ahead. I couldn t agree with you more in your assessment of hollyweird s new generation of writers being more woke than qualified for their jobs  further  because youre spot on. its always the writing and being beaten over the head with the woke message above all--and little is more irritating than some wokester trying to pick a fight with words to the effect of  what message do you mean what are you talking about  as an excuse to go off on you  whatever your answer is. nice try  kids.
this is the same b.s. we star wars fans went through with kathy kennedy. all movie and t.v. contracts should have a clause that the original material must be respected. if you are not a fan  stay the bleep away from it. the most talented actors and directors cant put out good stuff if they dont believe in it.
its ironic. when the first image of henry with the bad wig showed up on the internet  I would never have thought he would become the only thing worth a damn about the show...
they ll need to have millions to make any sort of change...
melonie s  Im a tomb raider fan  statement is on par with ben shapiro s statement that his wife is a doctor. all joking aside I appreciate you passion for the franchise.
I dont think this changes anything. but I love it! I love witcher so hate this show. and this maybe even a real  troll or whatever. but its also just witcher fans coming together saying f you to the shit  writers  because they know how we feel now.
I only watched the scenes of the witcher. I forwarded it through the 2nd season only watching his story..
I wonder how much money these people need to lose  since they love money so much  before they change their strategy of producing drek thatsimply isn t palatable to normal people. especially people who are fans of a particular genre.
dump the writers  let cavill direct and star.
bring back henry. fire the hater s  Imean writer s
I dont understand the thought process that goes on with these companies.  ok  we own the rights to this product that has a ton of inherent fans  what should we do   I know  let s hire people that dont respect the source material and let them turn it to crap.  the fans wont really care ....     I dont get it at all.
fire the writers anyway but let cavill what do what he do. we need the man of steel back.
its even more worrisome cdpr fully has embraced the esg  environmental  social and governance  funds and the non negotioable standards criteria that comes with it  for a companies policies and products content. of which the fist signs were already visible in cp2077  which wasnt the hardcore over the top cp experience they originally sold us. most entertainment companies use these multI trillion dollar funds  which makes it possible for them to continue to double down  and effectively kills the customers power  vote with your wallet .
anybody has link to this pettition
n-flix has trends of supporting heresy and anti-ip strategies.  we canceled our n-flix account in after ks s motu-r heresy that was fully supported by n-flix.  the 100k  witcher  phans would have such a powerful impact if they all canceled their subscriptions and left.  that is what will actually make a change  not  petitions.   as the great classic  excalibur   1983  dialogue declares   talk...talk is for lovers merlin.   and for those witcher phans that our upset  we have our very own  dor vahdor lost legends and sagas of preflood earth  waiting for you to join us on a grand adventure.
he quit because he saw the story going wrong  and the writers refused to fix it.  I dont blame him for leaving.  the show is going bad because of the production team.  petitions wont do squat unless the production team is fired and replaced with competent  non-woke  people.
so how do you feel about the angelina jolie tomb raider
it would be great for the actual fans of the witcher.  the show will ultimately fail and go away before  we ever get it back. if they go ahead with the change.
143k and now gaining steam.
there is no point firing the writers if they dont also fire the showrunner ... she is about as toxic as they come
if folks would drop the service  that would get hbo s attention.  when they re still raking in the revenue from unhappy viewers  they ll continue as they want.  I avoid the bums completely.  I have hobbies  I have games.  I dont have to watch bad t.v.
funny how they just named gal gadot  most attractive woman  or whatever and she looks like the dime store version of melanie mac. lol.
if crouching tiger hidden dragon had an old giant white guy in it   I would of been shocked  and disappointed.
if henry cavill is fired. we riot!!!
in all fairness  I read all of the novels and Im not a fan of them  either  they were bloated with huge amount of political intrigue and geralt was only focused on about 40  of the time. I haven t gotten around to the games yet  but Im certain that they ll be better than that.
why do they think  every single damned time that a show with a male lead should be written by man-haters is a great idea
he quit he s not coming back. its not like netflix fired him.
cavill was the only draw to the show    as great as it would be to have him back with a good show runner   great writers I doubt it will happen.he only has so much time to devote to projects    superman is higher profile   pays more.its just how things work.if they get good writers   a good showrunner in there  hemsworth could end up being a good geralt.otherwise the show deserves to fail.
make cavill the showrunner.
we have the best the witcher adaptation- it is the mandalorian.
they go woke  and they go broke! happy time to see these closed minded activists and get what is coming for them  going with laughable boom!glory to darkius  glory to us all!!!!
what are they thinking wanting to replace cavill with the beta hemsworth
the witcher is doomed without cavill. my interest in the series waned already with season two. at this point  I will be very surprised if I watch beyond season three.
who s got the link  I want to sign it
this isnt happening. cavill has made is very clear he is done. the showrunners have made it also very clear they do not care for the source material. no fan petition can save that. cavill has returned as superman anyway. Imuch prefer him as the man of steel anyway and support his decision to leave.
it could get a billion signatures but it wont help. look at all the people that wanted season 8 of got remade. just shouting into the wind it never makes a difference  they dont care.
let s not fix the problem  but put a bandaid on it
at this point  there is no saving the witcher series. they butchered the  blood of elves  story line and relegated it to be a subplot in favor of some new original storyline that was frankly disappointing by comparison. now with henry cavill leaving after season 3  I would guess that the writers did the same thing with the  time of contempt  storyline.these writers dont want to adapt witcher series  they want to write their own thing and use the witcher ip as a vehicle to help bolster their view count.
I just watch kdramas and listen to kpop. my son 14  reads manga and watches anime and loves itzy.nothing in the us entertainment interest him.
the fans of the witcher has been demanding firing of the writers and the showrunner after the first season  js.
Imight assume the writers have contracts and thats why they cant be sacked    Im no longer interested in the witcher. there must be something really bad coming up in the series if henry felt he had to go.  you can already see the writers are going for an all female lead cast  and Im not interested in that. I already had problems with some casting  especially yennefer. henry as giralt was the only good thing  but there wasn t enough of him. they should have focused on giralt for the first season.  another series trashed
as soon as they race swapped my girl triss I checked out.
how can you hire writers for a franchise that is loved by millions of people only to find out just now that they actively mocked and disliked the source material...wtf was there no meetings with these people  did no one ask if they were fans  or at least didn t hate the material
its netflix. they wont admit they re wrong until 3 years from now. they ll trot walmart brand thor out  then blame him not the writers.
typical. show was a success not because of those hack incompetent writers  but because cavill was a near-perfect personification of geralt.now only driving force behind show is leaving  they are keeping those talentless hacks and actually create spinoffs that are pretty much guaranteed to be  for modern audience  judging by titles .brilliant  absolutely brilliant. it is like buying tickets on titanic  while itsinks.
not surprised. it would probably be cheaper in the long run to do that  or simply cancel the show.I wouldn t be surprised if they pulled it off though. stranger things have happened. certainly  if not for political discrimination  it would be easier to get better writers.
they should fir the writers instead get people that actually care abour the source material
sorry witcher fans  we superman fans had him first.  thatsaid  you should at least keep the part of the petition to get new writers.
the damage has already been done.
I would say  since the middle of first season  or even before that.
I would be fine if he was replaced  however the much bigger issue are the eriters of the show which probally will be the nail in the coffin for this series.
wait...why would you be a writer of a series based off the books and video games and disregard the books and video games
common sense thats not controversial wot a world we love in
they might as well cancel the show at this point. the first season was great. the second  fell off a bit into mediocrity. I am not a huge fan  but henry cavil made that character interesting and to see some other actor replace him for the same role  no offense to that actor   doesnt give me confidence in the show. at best  they should make another series spin off with another witcher character within the universe  but even then with the lose ends  that wouldn t work to well either.
whats funny with all the  swapping  going on  im surprised they haven t gone after scott pilgrim yet...lets hope they dont.
melonie  you actually can drop more than one video a day. thats ok.
diversity is just a red herring here  not the actual problem. no one cared that the valeryons in house of the dragon were raced-swapped... because it did not take over the show. the raced-swap actors were all great  the quality of the writing did not change  the lore was decently respected  and the story just kept being captivating. the problem is when talent-less and passionless show-runners adapt a lore despite never having any honest intention of making a fateful adaptation of it. they dont care about the actual lore  they just want to take over something already established  that comes with an already established fan-base  because they want to make a name for themselves in hollywood  and   create the next big thing   that they can claim as entirely their own. they dont have the talent to actually write their own thing... nor the patience to establish their own fanbase. they take what they think will be the quick and easy road... not understanding  or greatly underestimating  the glaring flaws in their plan.
I feel bad for hemsworth. I like him as an actor but he will be shit on because of these horrible  writers
sorry  but dude is not going back. from everything Ive read it looks like he wasn t happy with them  meaning it was a personal decision. yeah  of course his paycheck for playing superman is gonna be higher  but I think he wanted to leave the witcher because he cared about the writing.
what lady can possibly think henry is sexy
they just announced that netflix is supposed to be developing a gears of war series as well. after seeing the witcher  cowboy bebop and resident evil get ruined by netflix my reaction would michael scott from the office  God please no! they ve already ruined the above mentioned and now gears is next on the list to be slaughtered. halo was ruined by paramount so I dont think there s any studio that can do it right.
discord is the one place where you cant talk  all things  - defos not politics  just read discord s own tos on it.
why do the producers always have to ruin it for us  dont mess with the formula that was already good and working...
books and games are better. first season was alright  fast forward events but stayed in line with the books for the most part but I just stopped watching during the 2nd season. this show will die without henry
just stop. he left for whatever reason he left and he s gone.
all we wanted was geralt hunting monsters. instead we got another got wannabe. so sad at this missed opportunity. henry and witcher fans deserved better.
whether cavill comes back or not  the writers being derisive of the source material will mean the show is gonna be ass regardless.  firing the writers show runner needs to happen no matter what.  no show should ever be headed up by anyone less than a fan and expert of the material the show is based on who wants to represent it faithfully on screen.  otherwise you get shitshows like what disney broadly has done with star wars  or amazon with lotr  that just are dumpster fires that alienate the fanbase that the original property might have brought to the show.I dont mind diversity when it makes sense for the work and isn t shoveled in as part of some social agenda  as I have no problem seeing myself in a protagonist and being able to empathize no matter what their race or sexual orientation  etc... it requires mustering the very bare minimum of imagination to be able to empathize with a character s plight and circumstances without them having to be precisely analogous to one s self and it is stupid af to assume otherwise.
300k signatures now.
I honestly glad he left  the show was already doomed to fail as soon as netflix hired a showrunner that didn t like the books and she isn t exactly a talented or competent in her job  on top of thatshe also hired inexperienced incompetent mediocre writers that also hated the books and games  so no matter what henry try to fix  he had no control over the project and that is why he left.

well we do on my server and haven t run into issues yet lol
probably either just a matter of time or the wrong person to enter your discord...
the only thing that will make the people at netflix pay attention to this is if 100k subscribers up and quit the platform because of the witcher. while Im sure a good many will  unless netflix loses over a million dollars because of this crap  they re not going to care.
the witcher series pisses me off to no end. they had the best possible actor for geralt. they had a ready-made audience  with game of thrones going down in quality  then ending. they were willing to adopt some elements from the beloved video games. so of course they fuck it all up by putting a bunch of woke ideologues in charge. cavill probably got fed up with being the only person with any clue on how this project should be handled. in a just world careers would be ruined over such mismanagement  but I guess they re all on the kathleen kennedy plan...
so where was the petition to fire the writers earlier  oh wait these same people didn t care cause they are thirsty and simps. they will happily accept bad writing as long as a handsome man is on screen also lauren hissrich who before waaay before posted pics of her having the books and reading it making herself look so into the lore only for it to come out thatshe doesnt like the lore. wtf. I dislike these ppl with a passion. so fake.
personally  Im glad he s gone. because that will deal the show such a blow that hopefully itshouldn t recover from. aside from him  the entire cast of this show is absolutely terrible  whether its the wrong actors or just picked for the wrong roles   most of the story changes they ve made so far are absolutely abhorrent  and Im sure they ll take it even further in season three. Im not even going to talk about any world or character building.  having said that  the characters have always been the most important thing about the witcher in my opinion  no one could save this anymore  even if they tried hard. even if cavill came back  I wouldn t take anything less than a complete reboot with completely new writers  creators and actors  and they d best fire the dickhead who put the super loud music in the intro .
100  agree about the diversity thing.  just watched all quiet on the western front  and that could not be made in hollywood today.  a movie with an all white  historically correct  cast is racist   does not represent the world we live in today.
diversity  belongs in an endless pit of nothingness. that notion of  diversity  that acts as some messed up form of  motivation  for companies who only care about making money  and appearing  good  in the eyes of the general public  mainly those who dont care about anything remaining authentic to the source materials.
amazon has axed the showrunner  of   the     entire stargate tv universe because they didnt like his take and wanted a movie with thors little brother  17 seasons of the   greatest scifI tv universe and instead of getting the  guy who created  it they got thors ujnger  brother  what makes  little   hemsworth more qualified to run the fucking thing better then  brad wright  !  God of war blew up  as soon as telq the voice actor got a kid  general professor samantha carter had her own scifI show and is a tv director  mcguiver is mcguiver  chloe weant on to star   in originals and has horror cred  elI got wripped I saw him on henry danger it was rediculouse. aqquaman  jodelle ferland  ... so many people as part of scifI legacy and it was just tossed away over a fucking hot guy from the hunger  games.
witcher fans routinely disappont me because of how they keep dumping their support on a blatantly plagiarized character and then they get tricked into a bait and switch and still blindly support it.
too late. where was the petition to the fire the writers the first place  of course the reason no one did so is that they were getting their shipping with cavill still on the screen.
I respect the petition  but as a book fan  the damage is done. the realistic outcome is the show is canceled after its 4th season. let this virus run its course  then hope better showrunners or filmmakers get their hands on the property.
I d like to see your take on the woke people being angry about ffxvI being  too white
melonie  check out about the woke journos attacking ff16 for been too white and the dev dunking on them!
brillant take on the diversity debate.. imagine standing outside a cinema when wakanda forever opens complaining about there not being enough asians or white people in it
theres no point.. the writers already damaged the series beyond repair!
cavill was done with doing a television show no matter what. its too much of a multi-year commitment. fans are idiots.
henry cavill is an amazing witcher. the writing is sub par  even though they have books of content. the whole thing is stupid
where do I sign
the showrunner herself dislikes the witcher franchise and the works of the original author.she s just exploiting a known brand to use as a propaganda piece.cavill was carrying that whole show on his shoulders. without him there s neither pushback against woke fanaticism nor a push towards authenticity and respect toward the franchise.not to mention that cavill is probably the best fit for the role as geralt that there is.I stopped watching by season 2 and only got that far because of cavills great performance.I ll not be picking this show up again  thats for sure.
change the writers  actual writers  talented writers first. even if cavill came back it wouldn t solve anything.
yep they came out in the same year got ended and left fans wanting more. this was supposed to be a hit.
I saw that! plan on covering it tomorrow

yes  fire all the people henry doesnt like or agree with and let the witcher live!! without henry I wont watch it.
I like henry cavill. I ll support a boycott of the series. Ive got nothing against any hemsworths  though. Im not aware of any transgressions by the brothers. they seem like good people.
nothing will happen but its good to see henry get support coz netflix the witcher sucks balls
didn t like season 1 very much because I read the books and the series didn t resemble the books  it looked more like a dream of an obnoxious 15 year old woke activist from portland. one exception  the brilliant witcher interpretation of henry cavill.season 2 was even worse  the  mentally  immature woke writing guild went even further with their despoilment of the source material. it was obvious the activists  they call themself producers  casting directors  screen writers  despised the books  games and the fandom.another book  another game  another franchise  another tale  another myth  another history ruined by ideology of the tiny but  clearly extremely powerful and vocal woke minority.
I signed the petition  bring back cavil and fire the writers
much as I d like to see cavill maintain his role as geralt  its probably just as likely that he left because of scheduling conflicts as well as any differences with the writers. and I cant blame him for holding to the role of superman over continuing to be part of the series. regardless of the overall reason  I trust he made the best choice for himself. we can only hope that the witcher gets a redemption arc in terms of the writing
they nailed the casting but once you notice that your writers are making fun of the source material  you gotta start over.
I have to agree with the fans. remove theses foolish writers.
im very thankful that cowboy bebop live action was cancelled for these same reasons. these writers dont care for the source material now I got wait for the one piece live action to bomb hard and it will bomb hard
season 1 was not terrible but 2 I was bored with
just say andre sap-kow-ski
Im not watching a single episode anymore. if cavill thinks its not worth his time then I know its not mine either.
henry dont have time play geralt anymore. only reason he was able take the witcher role because he lost superman role. now that he returns superman   hopefully he will be next james bond  he does not have time anymore.
@melonie mac go boom
how about talking about your pets
your tattoos are neat
agreed  the writers should all lose their jobs. wont be watching hemsworth try to fill cavill s shoes as geralt. season 3 is the end of the show for me.
cavill was smart to leave that awful show it got worse every season.and by the way only fools sign those online petitions they are absolutely useless and do nothing.
its at 150k now lol
I got rid of netflix a while ago. since they started with that cuties trash.
Im so tired of politics agenda writing. cavill was the only reason I pushed through season 2. probably wont watch season 3.
160k now.
well I guess I can skip any new seasons of this dogwater production if there s no cavill there s no show writers should be fired if they hate the source material so much and go ruin a different show
he s not coming back....and I dont blame him.
I have to agree. replace the writers. bring back the best part of the show.
why would I want that awful show back  they would have to do a complete do-over for me to consider watching.
prayer group   melonie are you starting up a cult
replace the writers  directors  producers.....
for the algorithm.
200k almost
what s up melanie mac!
I rather he stay away from the dumpster fire that is the witcher netflix series. call it karma for their casting and writing decisions.  notmytriss
love you
if the source material didn t exist they wouldn t have a job. be respectful and appreciative.
should we demand he stay the heck away from the witcher and its writers I dont want him anywhere near this mess. cavil superman must be saved I hope they do it right.
well  no more reason to continue watching
just let m go witcher fans u l love liam
let the woke lunatics keep the witcher  we recovered superman!
hollywood   hollyweird
how do you do you hair like this
notmyyennefer either
@nasreen choudary   God damn right - heisenberg
sure  jan.
wrong petition. what s the point of firing the writers if the showrunner s going to employ a different bunch of hacks to replace them  they should ve petitioned to change the showrunner. plus  going on with what they set up in season one  didn t watch 2  make little sense  either. they d need a reboot with new actors for many of the roles  and that is not rally plausible. the series is doomed. it was from the get go.
I dont think liam hemsworth can do this role. poor bastard he has an awful hill to climb to win over us fans...
just let him go and watch this show die
exactly!!! I didn t watch hong kong based karate movies wondering  where are the people that look like me ... I wanted to be taken away to a far off land  not be a fucking solispisist.
bwahahahaha!
thats 4sho  its very difficult to find new things to watch anymore. tons of propaganda is baked into everything now and having a good story comes dead last to hollywood
here s an idea. cancel season 4. the writers suck  they hate the content and the best part of the show just walked. nothing against liam hemsworth  but a recast isn t necessary. I give it one more season after that before it gets the ax anyway.
its at 148000 now  d
diversification by coercion
andrzej  is polish for  andrew . I hate seeing you struggle every time you try to read it
I hope he doesnt come back. its the only chance the shitty writers  or at the very least  those that employ them  will learn anything.
netflix dont deserve to have this franchise and henry cavill in its ranks  so I wont sign this petition  2nd reason is that online petitions dont work  especialy against wokies... .at this point I wish it to burn to the ground  just like so many franhises did these days!
its almost like people forgot all about cuties. shameful you give wokeflix money.
not in this society . maybe after russias dissolution and world wide revolution things will change   but for now people are just not able to play this game called life .
why dont they get the guy who played master cheeks in paramount s hideous halo adaptation.  lmao.  another show where the show runners said we didn t even look at the video game or care about the lore that it was made about.  mwuahahaha.
141 700 right now and increasing.
Im gutted that henry has left  all he wanted was the writers to keep to the source material.series 1 was great but I will not watch anymore  they have well and truly ruined something that could have gone on to be something special  disgusting abuse of something great.hemsworth replacing him will not work because the writers will still go on fucking it up for him!!there is only one witcher.
until he makes an official statement  im going with wb and dc money is much greater that netflix money. all these rumors are just click baity.
toss some coin to your cavill  and makes sure its plenty . without cavill and better writing am done with the show. no offence to hemsworth but he cannot fill these boots.
proof positive that today s  woke  writers have no talent whatsoever in creative writing.  zip  zero  nada  none.
no! stay away witcher fans  we need henry here as supes.
nah.  I dont want him back.  I dont want him to keep working on a passion project he doesnt enjoy doing. just throw the whole show away at this point.
well yahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  d
I think cavill has a fat contract with wb  so not gonna happen. netflix ruined the witcher  just let it die.
hey melonie  and dogs  yes just fired those clowns of writers and bring back cavil or just forget people are going to watch the witcher.
nah. Im glad he s gone. we need some big names that protect stories we love.
they demand  lol come on. what they would do  leave netflix  cry their houses and their parents cut them internet  nerds!!!! attaaaaaaaaack!!!!
what is the point   you people are not fans for wanting him to returnyou people just like eye candyhe left the show because its terribleaccept that there is no saving it and there never was
season 1 was cool  sesaon 2 was garbage and so boring. I can understand how henry feels
I wouldn t be surprised to see a passion of Christ remake where we have a korean non binary pink-haired Jesus one of these days
no I demand they end the series after season 3.
after season 2 I was out.   it was kind of boring.   why do these shows always sideline the main for side characters.  Im not a witcher lore guy.  I played the first game 15 years ago but not 2 or 3.    but season 1 was really interesting then they pivoted and made it all about the singer who I hate  the powerless boring witch lady and a little blonde mary sue girl.   why   no one was very interesting.  I dunno maybe triss was interesting but I also thought she was hot so maybe Im just simping.  but she wasn t really in it either.
woke culture  netflix not taking serious anything. they ruin everything good for henry to let that garbage called show die
let it go folks its dead on arrival let henry be. he s made his choice dont you think he fought for geralt   I bet he spent months fighting for better writing before throwing in the towel.
yes fire the writers. or get woker  go broker
I dont think anyone could replace henry to be good enough. netflix adaptation the witcher is dead
netflix from the days made golden nuggets. netflix of today make golden nuggets shit.
henry isn t coming back because the writing is awful and totally insults the source material.
there is a difference between diversity   diforceity.
no  not witcher fans. cavill fans are fighting this. witcher fans want this entire show erased from history.
175k
you are so beautiful.
why did they even bother renewing the show its dead..
no thanks  they ruined it too much already
it probably wont bring henry back but it hopefully sends a message to netflix. we wont watch or care about something you yourself dont care about. the witcher franchise is dead  I will not watch season 4 or support the extended universe.
idk why anyone even wants to bother saving the show. the majority of the cast sucks. henry cant carry the show if the writing doesnt improve..
this show is dead now. replacing the main character  rough writing. dead. they should ve done anything to keep hc.
cringey that his fans wont let him quit his job.
he will never come back
do these petitioners not realize that not one of these signed online forms have changes fuq all  the only reason you whiners got the snyder cut was because it was a money making machine for the studio. how many sigs does the remake got season 8 have  and what has that accomplished  and before anyone starts with the star trek fan letters leading to tmp remember that the studios have long since admitted that they did that because star wars made a fuq ton of money and all the studios lost their minds trying to find scI fic shit to put on screen.edit  diet pepsI hemsworth is going to be the main character from now on. they straight soap operaing this shit whether you want them to or not.
the only somewhat good things about this series was cavill  yennerfer s breasts and maybe the coin song. thats it. I would say the world doesnt need another season from these writers and showrunners. 100  boycott the s03  and s04!
it wasn t a good programme   even though I like him as superman   didn t think he was great in the witcher   the voice worked in the game   but sounded kind of ridiculous on tv...
all for the writing staff getting cancelled but this show is 3 seasons in no amount of writing will save this crap  let it die as the woke mess it was
you mutilate the name of andrzej sapkowskI terribly. read andrzej like andrew  because thats the english equivalent.
fans can scream all they want. henry is done with this woke garbage.
it was a terrible show  nothing of value has been lost here. good riddance.
I would prefer he doesnt come back and that they end thatshow  its not good  the writing sucks and the forced diversity cast makes it even worse  cavill was the only good thing about the show
this  forced inclusion and diversity  has backfired. time to end this and get back to proper storytelling
you would think that after so many videos mispronouncing the author s name you would have gone to the trouble to look up how its correctly pronounced. but no. also how clueless do you have to be to not realise that his name is just the polish verions of andrew unless of course you are doing this to gain comments. Ive seen this with other youtubers... and I wonder which one s worse.
its not dead yet
you must have never heard peter kenny narrative on all the books. that voice is the witchers voice.also the author himself gave thanks to henry for giving his face and acting skills to the character. and that to him he will always be the witcher. so he pretty much nailed that role. thats why theres over 100k signatures and why the whole fan bases will leave with him.
@chris cunningham  of course the show was shitty it wasn t lore accurate season 1 episode 1. the issue is henry fought hard to try and make them stick to the lore but at the end of the day he is just an employee. whatever success the show has is because of henry and his huge fan base that love his work. he honored his character and portrayed him as best he could winning over more fans. but this is a story writer producer problem wanting to keep it to thier woke shitty fan fiction which is why he left. wasnt even worth a  million dollars an episode for him to keep working on it.he cant bad mouth his bosses even if thier in the wrong and a piece of shit.  because it would get out there and people will think twice about hiring him in let s say  fear  of bad mouthing them too.
there are bigger things to cry about than how Imispronounced names that aren t from my language
@melonie mac go boom  there are bigger things to cry about than a stupid show. yet here we are. so since we decided to look into this subject why not be the best we can Imust say Im happy youre not doing this for the comments.
@melonie mac go boom  plus its just so cute everytime you struggle with pronunciation. I think you does it on purpose sometimes
