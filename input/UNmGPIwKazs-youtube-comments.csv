he wasn t even mansplaining! he asked a question   laughed at her joke and walked away.  no splaining at all.  I hate women like that.
totally agree.   Im a woman that is fed up with the men bashing. it hit me one day they are basically insulting my husband  my dearly departed daddy  my brothers  nephews  etc.   also to the lady in the coveralls I call bs.   I wear band tshirts and a man has never  ever asked me to name songs.   I have been nothing but welcomed into any hobby activities that are predominantly male.   in fact  the most judgement  and condescending crap I get is mostly from other women.
I think its actually hilarious that they ve made jen so unlikable that they have to make literally everyone around her cartoonishly awful so thatshe can seem decent by comparison
women need men  and they need us.  that is pure  distilled truth  folks.
man asks a question  woman answers with sarcasm. man laughs at the joke and moves on realizing he was mistaken.  how dare he mansplain to me! what if he actually needed help and was hoping she could help
women need men and men need us . perfect.
I think its funny how  feminism  and  uncreative terrible writing  are now synonyms
that last bit about men being afraid to approach women now is so true. I tried looking for dating advice on reddit  and I was bombarded with people  presumably women  telling me how wrong it is to just use a cold approach and just talk to someone. but  when I pressed further on what Im supposed to do then  they stopped replying. so  if they dont want men to approach them and want to be left alone  why the hell are ya ll giving advice in a dating subreddit then I saw another video of some rainbow haired feminist here on youtube  crying about how she d have a panic attack if someone approached them on the street. and Im like   Im sorry  but  how the hell am I expected to meet people if I cant even talk to them nowadays   this legitimately screwed me up for a while because I had no clue on what to do. it wasn t until my teenage sister reaffirmed to me thatsome women do like being approached  and like a man with confidence and initiative. these feminists dont speak for all women  and their shitty attitudes are just ruining the dating scene for everyone.
Im 28 and Ive left the dating scene entirely. the women Ive tried to get close to have made me feel like Im just not good enough to be part of their world. or that Im ok  but they can do better. nowadays  it feels like it would be foolish to walk up to a woman and talk to them.
melonie   we need men and men need us.   so true!  keep spreading that message!
that first episode with jen comparing her anger to bruce s is just weird. like there was no need to make it a pissing contest in the first place  and even if it was the examples she pulled weren t even comparable in either scale or nature of the anger. its just so detached from reality I feel nothing but  ok .
its refreshing to see an open minden woman who can see tjrew all the bullshitsocial media tells us thanks you got my sub. appreciate all your doing for both women and men thanks.
I just miss shows showing men and women supporting each other. this is one of the reasons I loved black panther. he exhibited true masculinity but wasn t ashamed to rely on his women when he needed support. they had respect and reverence for each other. the women were also strong.
Im so glad I found your channel. its really refreshing to hear other women share my gripes with feminism and fake oppression.
my God thank you.  I needed to hear a lady say this stuff b c Im just at a loss w  females in modern society.  you pretty much cant say or touch modern women.  its too risky for unattractive men like me   I wont reach to shake a woman s hand b c I have no clue how she ll take it.  I wont say she looks nice b c complements are sexual harassment.  its made me want to not even approach women for anything unless its damn near life or death.  you d have to literally throw yourself at me to get me to acknowledge you b c I dont want any problems lady.  I tried to help a woman driving on her rims w  kids in the car.  she yelled at me  rolled up her window    drove off.  I imagine her   her kids are dead now
if the guy was genuinely asking if she was a mechanic which she seemed convinced   isn t that a sign the guy respected that mechanics aren t only men  good video. love the neffex plug in at the end
I dont think you could have said it any better.  we need men and men need us . absolutely on the dot. cant make a human without both a dude and a chick  and both sexes are better at certain things than their counterparts. we cant solve all our problems only with one or the other
she straight up got upset thatshe assumed he thought she couldn t be funny and was actually fat. so  her body issues triggered her to make him into a villain.
Im a women and I roll my eyes when I watch this.  epitome of privilege first world problems.  so frustrating because I wanted to  love this show. also these same men didn t complain about the same actress leading in orphan black because that was well written. and that man asking her if she was a mechanic was being being nice.  men tend to joke with each other and I noticed how funny it is to be around men doing this.  but as soon as they treat a women in the group the same and joke with her  she gets butt hurt.  she thinks they are picking on her cuz they misogynist but its literally treating her as an equal.
and the sad truth is that men who try and speak up on this would be treated worse so thankfully we have good women like you who is aware and capable of speaking on our behalf.
it will only go away once pity points and victim vps are worth nothing on social media.  the preening narcissism on social media is a plague.
she was probably mad the guy didnt stay and hit on her so she could complain about toxic masculinity  so had to settle for mansplaining  and by that Imean had to falsely accuse  .
@daniel79tj  that was my thought too.  he asked a question  she made a joke in response  and he laughed like he was supposed to.  perfectly normal sequence of events.  but she s apparently so desperate for oppression thatshe ll take the most innocuous of interactions and fabricate some oppression out of it.
its normally woman who dont get any attention so have to make up this narrative that men are just bad. this woman worked on myth busters for years and had no issue with the 3 men that worked with her  now suddenly every guy is a creep lol she s gonna die alone with cats
same
and think of the question.  he thought she might have a typically male profession and asked.  he might have actually needed a mechanic or been a mechanic.  she let someone walk off that might have been interested and engaging intellectually because of her own sexism.  if this were a movie  she d find out he was actually some art dealer or artist she admires that could have given her career assistance she wanted  but she blew him off.
I dont expect anyone to guess songs from a band on my shirt. most of the stuff I listen to are an very niche and or in a different language.
ironic thing is he did just the opposite of what she accused him of. he saw her in coveralls  guessed she was in a predominantly male profession without prejudice  and got a response that may have made him feel embarrassed. the idea that he didn t get the sarcasm is not chauvinistic  but rather just dense. assuming she is a mechanic is actually showing respect to females and putting them on equal footing as males. for her to dismiss him is actually a step backwards for gender equality as next time he sees a girl in professional clothing  he will assume they re  eatin  pants.
tell em  girl!
I was actually put into a position where two friends of mine  one girl  one guy  wore band t shirts and both got asked what songs were their favorites and both couldn t name songs  equality!
@areion316  well here s the thing  apparently we can change our gender

Im pretty sure the dude just doesnt know fashion and the only thing he thinks when he sees this outfit is not cute but mechanic. mechanics are usual men so he thought it was interesting that there is a female mechanic and asked. found out it wasn t. saw her reply as a lighthearted joke laughed and left. no ill intent. she is probably butt hurt because she thinks he is insulting her outfit when its just an honest mistake.
@wtfwhat  thats hilarious.
@david yang  she s so desperate to be oppressed she makes something out of nothing.
right women like this complain that men dont respect women  and they dont even recognize what respect actually looks like.this was an opportunity to earn some respect and she f cked it up. women feel entitled to respect  no its earned.
I was going to say men are angry at she hulk fans.
same type of woman who if she was a mechanic would be mad men dont assume she is one
and people seriously dont understand why society is creating a pretty toxic environment for men. eeeveryone and their mothers are allowed to be awkward in social situations but men need to be perfect 24 7.
yeah such a karen thing to say.
psychopathic feminist will complain  even you just stand there as a man  and be silent they will still say your man splaining.
Im surprised she didn t name drop the poor guy
what we see when we read your comment   he wasn t even mansplaining! he asked a question   laughed at her joke and walked away.  no splaining at all.  I hate women like that.  what a feminist see when she reads your comment   ---I hate women
mansplaining isn t even a thing.
mansplaining isn t even a thing- just some nonsense they made up
unfortunately we cant be open about this either as none of your fellow dudes will back you up. they think simping gets them kitty
@meurum train  those aren t real men and they should be ashamed of themselves.
@deviccypher  saw a video yesterday of a guy proving a point that men are necessary etc and the dude gets shamed  no one backs him up. it was even labeled as  when andrew tate fans go out in public  lmao. unfortunately masculinity is dead and gone and not enough men are ready to show it
@meurum train  its not dead and gone.
@deviccypher  youre right its not gone  its in the closet with 200 locks.
@meurum train  you cant keep masculinity locked up.
@riddler  I applaud you.
@meurum train  its only dead and gone if you let them beat you down and hold you down. keep your head up  and shake the haters.
when men speak  they  splain
ripley  along with the rest of the characters in alien were written to be gender neutral. so the reason why ripley is such a good character is that her gender isn t important she is just written to be badass.
@sean mcgall  lmao definitely not
idk why theyre confused why thy get no man after acting like this lmao
Im winning to be this never happened. she made it up 100 . no dude no nothing
remakeshehulk
from what I saw  byron is seeing precisely what she wants to see  rather than the facts. very typical logical fallacy  and a sign of average to low intelligence. how sad.
what does this have to do with she-hulk
they just throw the word  mansplaining  around casually. a man cant approach or talk to a woman without it being called mansplaining.
@josu  patI o  thats incredibly racist.
@le cyber-purgatoire  60 yrs old  no family  lots of cats - what I see when I see a feminist.
@meurum train  maybe where you are. get away from the cities.
@roadreaper videos  yeah  eatin pants  sounds like a sitcom line. that doesent happen in real life.
@something or other  and go live in a small town in the middle of nowhere  no thanks
if I remember right kerry byron used to play a sexy scientists before mythbusters. dont quote me on this  itseems she more annoyed about not being as hot as she once was.
wait till you get the police over you....cause you almost touch her in the elevator
@wtfwhat  thats definitely a great example of equality.
@jo  yeah poor fella probably absolutely meant no harm only to ranted about.   hopefully he s blissfully unaware.
my sincere condolences for your father.
remakeshehulk
youre all right  sassy77.  all of the men in your life are happy you are there  as they should be  and their lives are unquestioningly richer for that!
women are highly competitive with each other  especially now that men simply wont approach women anymore  and if men do its really rare. what women dont realize is that they are driving men away from them  and then blaming men for that fact.
@criticaldrive7  thank you so much.  he passed in 2009  star trek was our bonding franchise when I was a teenager and tng was just ending.   one of my brothers passed in 2014. so many things Im into because of toddling after him when he was a teenager and I was a little girl. too much to name.  and in turn bond with my nephews with the franchises
@mrhousecup  aww. thank you.   they have all enriched my life so much in turn.
honestly as a man I love it when females share my hobbies. all my male friends do as well. its fun for us to be able to share our interests with women. its surprising sometimes. its also pretty rare. but its still an exciting day
@sassy77  I see. those sound like wonderful memories. my sincere condolences for your brother as well. I certainly hope that things go well for you and your family.
when someone s project starts to fail its always easy to blame someone else for the reason why and if its a subject that is very touchy and or hot button issue that becomes the center of focus instead of the show and that gives those an excuse of why they put out a poor product or product that just doesnt resonate with the mass majority of fans.
you ma am  kick ass. we need more ladies like you lol.
I grew up reading comic books  hulk was one of my favorites! I am a purist... there can only be one hulk  like all classic superhero male characters  there should be only one of them  no female version. the point is that all female characters derived from the male ones are just in the shadow of their famous and well-established male counterparts. that does not sound like empowering when you are in the shadow of someone else and you are not even well received by the audience  because the audience remains loyal to their traditional  historic  beloved  and original superhero character. the best way to go about empowering women is not to copy an existing male character but to come up with a whole new superhero female character  an original one  with her own back story  her own characteristics  her own weaknesses  and her strengths. until then  these copycat super tired woke attempts only show desperation to compete  to prove to the world that women can be as strong as men  and be even more intelligent and stronger than men... maybe its time to produce a movie thatsums all this up  with a title thatsays... I dont know uh the delusion!!
too late for two generations. we ve moved on. got a whole alternate culture now.
@emiliano diaz  nah they forever ruined this character for me and she should never be seen in the mcu again
@scott doesntmatter  I was just thinking this to myself I dont feel comfortable approaching women. I dont want a false accusation that could throw my whole life away from me doing nothing. I feel for them the cat calling the threat of real dangers from both men and women but the lashing out at all men honestly just leaves me discouraged and fearful. should I hold the door open  should I help her pick up the stuff she dropped. I work at a grocery store and I see customers looking confused I just wait for them to approach me cause the risk of losing everything I have just by existing is f-ing ridiculous and terrifying. dating rn is just out the window I dont even think anyone knows what they want from love anymore. I know what I want but the mindset Im looking for in a girl  I dont think it exist anymore
as a man  I agree that the men bashing has gotten out of hand. but  clearly  even though its hurting their bottom line  its not going to stop.
@the black armory knight  its not all about you  remakeshehulk
@antonio finotti  exactly!  that was definitely my dating experience before marriage but also it led to me having a lot of guy friends.  some of us girls into those things get friend zoned.   but guys far from questioning quizzing enjoyed date movies that most girls wouldn t go see.
@acemcschooly  thank you.  there are a lot us out there lol.  some are wallflowers
@emiliano diaz  its not all about you either. no need to remake it. the character sucks and the mcu needs to take a few years off.
me  as a veteran headbanger since the early 80 s  if I see a woman wearing a band tee shirt  I get excited more than anything else. when I ask what album of insert band here is their favorite  its due to the enthusiasm of a fan connecting with a fellow fan. its also what we men do to other men to determine if they re a poser or not  its a time honored metal head thing. women who seriously think they re being singled out somehow are victims in their own minds  imo.
I feel the same way about men who bash women.whenever I hear someone say  women do this   or  men do that   I ask  which one
speaking as a male and having seen the way male inner circles work  rarely will a man scrutinize a woman to her face. and most are welcoming to women. but  just like female inner circles  there can be some rotten apples. nobody is perfect. but I have personally seen males and females be both welcoming and unwelcoming to members of the opposite sex. it all depends upon upbringing and morals.
@dean hill  well said! itseems that with men in particular  though  the bad apples are exaggerated and blown out of proportion  do you think
@emiliano diaz   remakeshehulk!!!!
@john swain  difference is we re in a gynocentric society. men are bashed daily  women are rarely bashed  and when they are   youre a sexist meh!!
@Christopher pineau  oh absolutely  and I d even argue that the misandry and gynocentrism of our society often creates more bad apples then there are otherwise. you grow up  male  being told constantly that men are bad  how long before you just give in  and become bad  ya know
@Christopher pineau  oh yeah  definitely. I d say that with at least 7 out of every 10 men  most people are completely safe from ridicule and backstabbing. it is a great tragedy that women have been made to feel unsafe around men  as most of them would not harm them and would probably go out of their way to protect them from harm. chivalry isn t dead  its just hidden as its no longer safe to display on a regular basis. most men  myself included  feel an obligation and duty to protect those around them. especially those that cant fend for themselves.
@lex ruptor  I hear that from media  including social media   but I dont actually see it in real life.yes  there are things that are bad for men in real life  false accusations being a good example  but there are also things that are bad for women. a lot of the things that are bad for good men are also bad for good women. for instance  false accusations make people less likely to believe true accusations. the kavanaugh and depp trials harmed good women.a lot of  woke  guys are some of the biggest misogynists Ive met in my life. sure  if you look at their social media  it looks gynocentric  but if you look at the women in their lives  you ll find a lot of victims of controlling  overbearing  and just plain psychotic masculine behaviors.none of my hobbies are very welcoming to women - playing pool as a man is easy  but doing it as a woman is a minefield. I can go just about anywhere without worrying thatsomeone s going to se8ually attack me  but the same cant be said for women.I dont envy good women these days - the  femminists  have screwed them over badly.
I remember in high school a girl was wearing a pink floyd shirt without the name of the band on it. this guy in class told her he liked her shirt because he loved the album the shirt was based on and she said   oh  this is a band shirt  I just thought the rainbow was pretty.
@the_rockness  oh bless.  she does sound like a normal person who just answered the question without making it a big deal  which it is not.   I have asked a couple of girls here and there about their band shirt and they just liked the symbol or design.  no big deal.  Im sure your friend did get a bit excited since pink floyd since us female fans are few and far between.
@sassy77  yeah I wasn t saying anything bad about her. Im just saying if you wear a shirt of something someone is a fan of  they re going to ask you about it. its called a conversation.
the show is honestly just delusional. everything its saying goes in complete opposition to one of the most celebrated lawyers this year  camille vasquez  and if the writers showrunners had any idea what the real world is like  they would ve written jen to be more like her.
@jo  exactly like if you were  offended  why would you laugh and joke with him... I think that actress just wanted some of that woke clout from twitter
this woke community is born from broken family. its sad
@peeko_luxx  at least until we die  yes  apparently  not sure if it resets after.
thanks so much. reading this is actually a ray of sunshine.
I know im a male so no kidding im bothered by it  but same  Im tired of male bashing too  both from the internet and in real time from peers while I hold my tongue  plus the one time I didn t hold my tongue with my parent s generalization of men  I got argued out. me and a bunch of dudes already deal with male-bashing enough irl  so I dont think anyone needs that crap in the media that they originally wanted to enjoy. heck Im tired of being pushed around by some women anyways. Im glad to have female friends that dont do that crap to me  and male friends that dont do that crap to women  plus I dont even have to worry about them bashing me at all as a male.
lol my dearly departed daddy
@sassy77  its such a shame because girls like that are always my favorite
if I were to ask someone about the band t-shirt someone was wearing  it would just be to start a conversation.I have way too many t-shirts  mostly festival and mashups  and can I have conversation about each and every one of them.and if the answer I get is   its my husband s t-shirt   thats fine too. maybe I want to meet her husband.
@jo  quite a few sci-fI fans have a favorite female mechanic who wore overhauls with a teddy bear patch.if not a mechanic maybe cosplay
