how did that guy not know thatshe is married  there s no way he donated all that money and not know her relationship status. bro was literally having a one-sided relationship in his head the entire time
I feel like we are in such a fragile time in where many good men are looked at in that light of other dumb men like this  and guys like this dont help the situation.
melonie mac hires a lawyer after this story  keeps him on retainer.
thats terrifying  sorry to hear that happening to you as well. people choosing to send money is their choice they dont own the streamer. I cant believe this woman is getting sued.
I love watching your videos. you allow me to have a fresh perspective when it comes to content creation. makes me sad thatsomebody thinks that they can buy somebody s affection over the internet. I dont come on people s things looking for love. granted I am already married and dont need to date ever again. I appreciate your content for another reason. its so refreshing not to see more woke garbage on here or people cussing up a storm. as a Christian I know people mess up. but its nice to hear voices that are not the traditional Christian voice of like a pastor. keep up the good work and may God always walk with you.
I fell in that trap. it was a nightmare for me  as a result I had forgotten how to interact as a human being to women in person  and not pay money and believe a lie. my social skills are much better now  I dont over think when talking to a woman  and my comfort level with other people over all is fantastic. investing in myself  depending only on what God thinks of me and who I am in Christ helps me stay free from that trap.
stories like this is why it is wise to make yourself a  hard target . ie  camera on front door and other outer areas  tall fences  walls  keep your doors locked  living in a area that has security already in place  and last but not least  if you legally can  having firearm s  and other tools for protection.stay safe out there
wait  youre saying if I donate  1  Im not married to said streamer !
to be honest  I was a supporter and after one time or another via other streamers  I learned the hard way that  donations  do not work. people have mostly gone to loving things and using people. I am grateful that my girlfriend is in my life  because not only does she love me for me  but she has provided far more for me than most people in my life and in turn I help her pursue her dreams  especially if she does good for people with talent that would ve never had a chance otherwise  which is something that I enjoy inspiring those people to purse those goals. recently she and I are leading a bassist towards a better path that I have seen most do. for dylan  the bassist  it would absolutely crush my heart to know thatsome agent got ahold of them and ended up twisting him into someone that is  self important  instead of someone with dreams that could inspire so many people himself.
the bank should have never sided with that guy.
yeah  thats an issue with parasocial relationships. and let s not pretend there is any shortage of streamers stringing simps along  being deliberately misleading and manipulative. some of this garbage really just needs to be sorted out in the courts  with receipts.
this happened to me with someone in my community. he was very generous. however  once he expressed he wanted a personal  romantic relationship and I  a straight married man refused and explained that donation do not entitle him to that he has begun sabotaging me and bad mouthing me in shared communities. this is a real problem for creators and one I never expected to ever encounter.
Im gonna sue melonie mac for looking extra pretty today
so how d you and mom meet   it was super romantic and long story short I just had to be top donations for several years and then sue her for not reciprocating and she finally caved.
saw your latest appearance on the critical drinker. subbing to you. to stop the madness we have to support those with integrity who dare to go against   the message.  youre not alone  we re not not the minority.
my first thought was the comedian ron white s comment  you cant fix stupid but this does bring up a darker side of the internet where lots of crazies lurk and some of these could become stalkers or worse and turn violent against the person they re infatuated with. stay safe out there melonie. I support mostly musicians starting out that are female. it certainly has nothing to do with wanting some weird relationship. I do it because when Imet my wife  who is now deceased  she was a struggling musician trying to gain a foothold in music and its a remembrance in her honor.
howdy melonie.  tough topic.  the unnamed virus of unknown origin locking folks up for two years has stunted interpersonal skills growth.  gotta wonder if things would had got so bad if the last two years had gone closer to normal.
hey melonie love your new content and hope your doing alright. me Im trying to do ok with my health but its been trying to get worse by the day and your verses from the Bible helps me stay positive and me streaming on twitch for 9 to 10 hours a day really helps me keep in focus and not worry about things. I dont even ask for followers or subscribers or anything like that because I really do believe its the viewers who matter and what they like. if the people loves the games you play or content you create then they will support you right  Imean I have 130 views and 20 followers on twitch and I dont ask for donations or anything like that because they follow me because of the type of games I play for hours and I let people see games that they cant probably afford the opportunity to see how games look and play so they can make opinions if they like the game or not. thats what I do and I dont have a fancy pc or anything like that I just have a xbox and a tv to stream on and its a great hobby thats what I love to do. but twitch really needs to try to get rid of modders and scammers coming in streams and harassing me for information its really getting out of hand and those bots too with them telling me to go to a fishing website to buy followers or subscribers I dont like that and I have to manually ban those bots for doing fraud things. I wish mixer was still a streaming platform.  sorry for making a long comment I hope you have a great weekend and stay strong Im a believer in God and I know he will give me paths to take to help me with things that needs to be done. God sees everything and he knows things.
I remember watching a compilation of twitch streamers receiving huge donations and their reactions on yt. at the time I was amazed by the generosity  great reactions - humanity restored. after seeing today s video  I wonder how many of those female streamers had pits in their stomach...
well heck  now Im wondering if I can sue for a crazy girl falling in love with me in the past!Imean if it can work one way   certainly it can work even the more important other way.
the fact thatshe was married probably made him more desperate.
youd be surprised how many guys either ignore it or dont care or in some causes like certain popular streamers I could mention they lie about it or hide it. there are sadly some women who will take advantage of desperate guys and give them that hope that maybe if they donate enough they ll be a couple. I dont if the girl melonie is talking about does that but theres all kinds of mentalities when it comes to this stuff
@nihonguy  yeah man  I d say if you spend enough time in a community and you often see people donating money with personal questions and the girl encourages it with vague  cheeky  answers  frequently wearing scantily clad clothing also doesnt help your image   then you might be involving yourself with this type of community where people try to please streamers for positive attention
yeah  its not like she had any financial motive to not bring that up. Im not gonna take anyone at their word on this sort of thing  and certainly not at second hand. creeps come in all stripes. some receipts would go a long way toward making either party believable. just empty talk til then.
oh he had to. Ive been in her chat a few times and there s always a guy in there named  kenner   you d never guess who that person is lmao
in fairness  let s not pretend thatshe likely wasn t upfront about being married. at least  if she s like other women streamers who cultivate a  simp  audience. these kinds of streamers get a lot of donations from creating the illusion of being single to plant the idea that if someone donates enough  she might notice him. now  this doesnt excuse the guy s actions in all this  Im just not convinced thatshe was honest about being married.
@chloe marlowe  regardless of specific examples  this is pretty much what I was trying to explain as a type of streamer
@chloe marlowe  she was upfront though  and talked about family life every so often. I was just feeling a little more flippant at 3am
@dmoney  then nevermind my point then. if she was upfront about the fact thatshe is married  then the guy has no excuse for what he did because he should have known she was married.
you d actually be surprised at how many girls aren t upfront about their relationship status. sure its not the chat s business. at the same time  if someone is asking about. you may want to disclose it or it will get ugly fast.
yeah  guys like this make the rest of us all look bad.
I believe there are two  maybe three sides to this.  maybe even 4.1.  any guy  or girl  who thinks you have a right to somebody else...you are weird.  seek help.  nobody owes you anything.2.  there are e-girls who are very sneaky  very subtle in making themselves seem attainable.  its the classic orbiter thing.  she makes itseem like she s attainable...but just dont ask...just hang out and who knows  maybe it will happen.   just like orbiters with real girls  these guys doing that with e-girls need to wake up.  she s not your girlfriend  and never will be.  ever...ever ever ever ever.  so keep that in mind when you donate.  donate if you like the content and want to help keep it going  but you must know you will get nothing back from that  except more content.3.  what may come of this lawsuit  is e-girls  and all content creators  having to post a disclaimer at regular intervals  noting the nature of the relationship between the content provider and the customers.  in short  making it clear it is strictly professional.  some lawyers will make some money to word it properly.Im so glad Im older and past all this nonsense.
@leroy russell  Ive never heard anyone refer to someone latching on as an orbiter. interesting. usually its friend zoned nowadays.I think 2 and 3 are the more likely outcomes of this. your first one is obvious.I also found out while doing some digging that this guy is a very well known music producer. so he cause more problems for her. doesnt make what he did right.
@chloe marlowe   these kinds of streamers get a lot of donations from creating the illusion of being single to plant the idea that if someone donates enough  she might notice him.  chloe  -o seems like a bad idea  some psychos might get the wrong idea from that...and apparently at least one did  -o
she s lucky he just sues her actually. because a lot of only fans have turned up death after a passion crime involving their donors finding out she was not into them....
not a bad idea  if she hasn t one already on retainer.  as prolific as mel is with her uploads  not to mention the twitch material  the die are rolling and will turn up sociopathic subscriber  eventually.
maybe melonie can ask thequartering or steven crowder for an introduction to their half-asian super-lawyer
congratulations on your break thru.  anxiety and low self esteem are so prevalent and so hard to let go of.  most people aren t aware that fear in itself can provide an open door for spiritual attack on us.  your testimony here just might help someone else put things in their proper perspective to make better sense of how we fit ourselves into this life.   never be ashamed of your younger self - remember  you wouldn t be the person you are now without their struggles and determination to be better.  we all fall down many times in life  but getting up and taking the next step no matter how we feel at the time is what makes our life s song sweeter to God s ears.
I dont think any of that matters. that will prevent random passerbys and petty criminals  but anyone committed to coming for you will do it regardless of all of those security measures. just look at tim pool.
@totesmcgoats  tim could well be dead by now  but anyone coming for him knows he is armed and has armed security. a strong defense is always a great idea.
you forgot to have a large guard dog.
@totesmcgoats  is correct on that being a  hard target  is hard to do  prepare for  pay for and etc.however  life is worth being hard to kill.
lol
hehehe.
you ll need at least  2 for that channel perk
you need to go up a tier my man. at least three fifty
I think there is a difference between 1  and thousands as this guy did.  but either way.  all this could be avoided by limiting donations to a certain amount but no female on twitch that gets these kinds of donations will ever do that.  gotta milk the men.
@finalhalo3  does twitch even have a method of limiting donation amounts
years ago I tried to purchase a mouse on amazon  hours after was like  I like this amazon prime thing   and suscribed for a month to try irdays later then I got a mail saying  I havent paid the mouse  I check and have the charce for an amount similar to the price of the mousecall the bank they make a investigation and find out I accidentally got the 1 year subscription for amazon prime  left in 0 my balance and told me lile was my mistake will charge me  60 more for the investigation
its not like the bank sat down and listened to both sides of the story to figure out if it was legit or not. they receive a chargeback request with the reason being fraud so they are pretty much obligated to return the funds because of fraud protection. its sad but she is pretty much guilty until proven innocent in this situation. from the sounds of itshe is innocent but Ive seen these types of things go alot deeper than you d think they would. Ive seen situations where they will hold a relationship over the other persons head so they will keep donating and it can get really manipulative.
@criteec  that must be a fascinating court case.  fraud departments aren t supposed to be there to protect against buyer s remorse  but rather account hacks and identity theft.  scams really complicate that process though.
I kinda had my suspicions since the first time Ive seen something like that. like   nah bruh...when someone pulls some freakishly big favors for someone like that  its either a mobster or a psycho.
@dave and his death beanie  or mr. beast flexing
you cant buy someone s love. you cant. if youre rich  someone may offer themselves to you  but its just not love. there s either a natural connection...or there s not. and some people just need to accept that.sorry you had to go through that  melonie.
thats the danger of this social life on the internet   people expect something that isn t there but they make it up as if its real .  stay safe.
its one thing to like someone s content and be a fan and all. and follow on there social media. but you shouldn t think that just because you send money to that content creator that they owe you anything. just be a fan not a weirdo. Imean there are a bunch of content creators I pray for all the time  like melonie mac   but most likely I ll never meet any of them. you just have to separate being a fan and having some weird obsession. keep up the good work melonie mac. we all look forward to your content and I love that you share your faith with us. thank you.
thats crazy melonie   -o  I hope nothing bad like that happens to you on here because I like seeing your profoundly beautiful face and enjoy your personality and look forward to seeing your videos
being totally serious  the best way to build a  personal relationship  with a streamer or content creator or w e is to not try. just be around on their streams comment sections long enough and sooner or later your username will get recognized  either for good reasons or bad  and you may end up actually interacting with them as something other than a part of the  chat monolith .  it happens more often with smaller content creators  admittedly  but the best way to become more involved is to not actively seek it. on a further note   internet friends  are not beholden to you. period. its staggering to me how many people my age and older seem to have forgotten what real friendships  or more broadly  inter-personal relationships as a whole  are in favor of one-sided internet friendships. friends on the internet can be wonderful things  but you have to be realistic with your level of investment.
you never need to thank me for watching one of the damn best channels there is God bless and keep up the amazing work
I guess he missed the good ol  days when you just bought bartered were given your spouse.
pretty sad that it even needs to be said that donations dont imply a personal relationship.
you only have about 30 days to dispute a payment so she apparently spent all the money as soon as he sent it.  probably best practice to sit on those donations for a month until the dispute period is past.
parasocial relationships are tough for some people to understand. to support the content you take in  is a luxury. you can always go to the public library and get books and movies.
just saw you on the critical drinker s channel   wanted to say thank you for your integrity   courage
oh yeah  I would imagine for you that could get dicy!   Im in a band  sometimes we get similar things with people.  I ll talk to anyone about music gear or whatever but as you said there is always that one person  that thinks Im going to take them on tour or whatever.   and my band isn t super huge  had one person basically go on a tirade that we suck and that Im untalented when I told them we dont really let fans in the green room   expensive gear and really it can get overwhelming sometimes you need a second to group so you can put on a good show.   either way I shoot my money to who I want to support.  adam crigler is a good example of that  where I found you!  either I think there are more and more people who expect stuff the rest of us aren t selling.
people have a strange idea that a perfect relationship wont require effort... but what about if someone is your soul-mate perfect partner because you will change for the better by putting in the effort for them  and vice-versa.  not being forced to change  wanting to live up to being your best self
there should be absolutely no way that this guy should win in court. he gave his money to her willingly. itseems he is an indian giver as it were. wait!  am I allowed to use that term still without being raked over the coals  also  I could listen to your thoughts on life all day. thanks for the content melonie Im really enjoying your insight. perhaps I ll consider donating to you  with no expectations of course
I think a lot of us have gone through that weird  no faith  phase. mine was from 18 to about 25. I grew up catholic  but I am much more Christian now than am catholic.
I fell away from the faith for 10 years!  so thankful I didn t die during that time.  God bless.
the saddest thing is that this should be obvious. when you chat in a comments section  or a chat box on twitch  or what have you  you are not a  person  to who you are talking to. we like to imagine we are  but we aren t. you are words  and nothing more  until you meet a person in real life. even doing some sort of video chat isn t really  meeting someone. so if you are interested in someone online  and all you have is text and donations  you are text and money  not a person. it isn t because the streamer is a  insert gamer word.  its because they are human and  good or bad  they dont know you at all and never will. people really need to learn this lesson  and some need to learn it the hard way.
okay  I dont see how this is a thing. how do you go donate to a creator sue said creator for not wanting a relationship with you. not to mention the streamer has a family and you still expect them to reciprocate the feeling you have. I wish Imade enough to donate to all my favorite content creators. not for a relationship but for support like you said. karma is going to come back on that person. I hope she can bounce back from this. by the way love the verse of the days. one of the reasons why I like this channel. stay blessed
awesome content  keep up the good work!
wow! have you ever had to deal with crazy like this
shhh she wont reply back we re the minority
the answer is yes.
happy earth day  drunk 3po
@john  I definitely know no relationship is intended for donations unfortunately some people dont respect boundaries
jay I liked this comment therefore you owe me your hand in marriage.p.s. dont tell my real husband.p.p.s. youre doing great!
keep in mind we re only getting her side of the story here  itseems. so this really depends on what sort of interactions they had  if any  outside of streams  and if he can prove them . otherwise  its really hard to say with only knowing her side of the story. from what we ve heard here  he seems like a desperate man.  but let s be real here - there are a lot of  pretty  streamer girls  and I can only assume some guys too  who would not think twice about leading people on to get more donations. and with the state of affairs of relationships between men and women right now  where most people meet through online interactions like this..  people need to get outside more and stop watching youtube   twitch  imoalso  this sounds like some legal precedence could be set here. are there agreements you need to go through before donating to someone  and what do they specifically state and who do they protect
if youreally must pay money for a relationship there are places you can do that. twitch and youtube ain t it tho.
reminds me of that one guy who became homeless after donating all his money to pokimane.
Im sort of conflicted on this because I know from being a jtv twitch user for so long. there is a behavior of some female streamers connecting with their top donators and mods. there was even the issue with a streamer who actively stalked her donators and used the information she gathered to try and target them for donations. also  there is the culture of female twitch streamers doing onlyfans and whatever else they re offering through dms.  there was also a controversy where a female streamer had a history of love scams and is still operating on the twitch platform  essentially allowed easy access to new victims . it would be wrong to assume that this is connected to any of that but I cant ignore the history. and as a counter point  there is a culture of parasocial behavior among users on twitch toward streamers. its turned into scary things and when money gets involved things tend to spiral.
money in exchange for a relationship to the highest bidder   ..its not a prostitution ring!! I want to say  I cant believe people are this stupid!   but it is 2022 ughhh
Im guessing the guy thats suing ms kenner is rich and is used to being able to buy anything and everything  so he thought he could buy her too. thats pretty sad  and its awful that ms kenner s dealing with this. you were smart  melonie  to have a disclaimer about your tips in the fine print!
a stalker is a stalker!  giving support money is not a license for a personal relationship.  God bless all streamers of good intent  you are entertainers and not someone s toy!
well  this is all too common.  lonely guys tossing money at a woman out of desperation  then getting mad when its just job income for her and nothing more.  people have thought Im one of those types of guys  unfortunately.  I know I have no filter  but as I explained further in the previous video to response to my comment  Im quite very married and thats one line Im never going to cross.  no one  man or woman  will ever have thatsort of trust or faith from me again.  I will admire natural beauty  as I always have since I was a child  but whereas some people might get all offended  the fact is that I see beauty in all things - people  nature  art  dreams... its just part of who I am and I will call it like I see it.  getting butthurt over my compliments and observations is pointless  as I am not after anything nor am I going to just magically stop noticing things.not everyone is like me  though  not everyone is just honest and forthcoming.  all too often people have an ulterior motive behind their being pleasant  and you wind up with situations like this.  the bottom line is  dont give people money expecting them to love you.   its a job  they expect to be paid  whether they re a waitress  delivery driver  streamer  or stripper.  there is always an invisible wall between the viewer and the performer  and you will never break through it unless the performer decides on their own that you are allowed to be more than just a viewer.  a job is a job is a job  yo.
I laugh  I love  I hope  I try  I hurt  I need  I fear  I cry. and I know you do the same things too  so we re really not that different  me and you.
this guy was really asking for it... he knew damn well this girl wasn t gonna fall in love with him by donating money...
how could people sue for this  this is literally smooth brain 2000 iq moments.
credit card companies and banks basically always side with the consumer. a court  however  will laugh in his face. Im so sorry you ve experienced this. it pisses me off and makes me want to fight your offender.
banks will always side with the customer when it comes to chargebacks. not only do they risk not keeping a customer if they refuse but the also get some money for the chargeback fee that is charged to the other party. itsucks but this is the way every bank does it. the entitlement of the guy is clearly deeply embedded in delusional line of thought and his unrealistic expectations. this really should go to court. that way it can be on record and this guy can get the help that he needs. while I do not have the extra   to support your content  you do have my gratitude. thank you again for all you do  God bless  and go boom!
may the Lord bless you melonie mac!
sounds like buying a relationship.  other than that being garbage  because you cannot really buy love  I am loving your natural do.  it looks great.  keep up the wonderful and fun content. God bless.
its going to depend on what kind of streamer she is and whether or not she led him on. if she s a tub streamer and or never disclosed thatshe was married or had a family  that may not work in her favor. generally tub thot streamers dont disclose whether they re married or have a significant other. they do that because it rakes them in more money. you think amoranth and indiefoxx are telling people they have boyfriends  they re not. because they know it will make them less money. which again goes back to did they actually disclose that information with their chat and or did they lead this person on. there s receipts somewhere. the other problem is that a lot of these streamers that have this happen to them dont set boundaries. you clearly have. which is good. I know of a streamer  not on twitch or youtube  that is leading a guy on and she s in a relationship. she s literally doing it for money. when asked if she has someone. she denies it. therefore causing the problem. which again goes back to what kind of a streamer she is and is she leading the person on. obviously not all women do this. youre a great example of that. however  there are more bad apples than one cares to admit. Ive seen it countless times.the thing that all streamers need to realize  especially female streamers. is that guys dont give money out of the goodness of their heart 90  of the time. if they re spending  1000 of dollars on you. thats a red flag. it means they want your attention and lots of it.  5 to  20 Im probably just enjoying your content. anything higher than that and they want your attention. Ive seen it happen a lot. now Im not saying thats a good thing. however  thats the reality.
that feeling when a streamer doesnt love you.... sue her!!! lol
I swear the internet has broken the minds of so many.
thatsituation is messed up in my opinion and I wish the streamer the best  .  also I agree with the verse of the day we cant trust anything thats why I always think its important to verse.
viewers can see the streamer   forget they are text on a screen to the streamer. they are lonely and not used to getting interaction with females. there are also streamers that hide their relationship marital status so that they can play on their viewers weakness. I cant think of any streamers that have gotten into a relationship with one of their simps. the story you began the video with is unusual in that the guy seems like he should be able to get a girl without paying her for her attention.
technically you pay for every relationship youre in. try harder there.I dont disagree that twitch and youtube aren t the places for it. however  these site actively promote it. so.....
yea agreed  that guys who is suing the streamer just needs to go out into the real world and talk to people.
@tofu topper  easier said then done for a lot of these guys. plus the whole  me too  thing doesnt exactly help with anything now days.
hit  how much did he give her
she was also smart to disclose thatshe was married at one point too. granted she s not now  so the other disclaimer is good.
it goes back to did she actually disclose it and or was she leading him on thinking it would make her more money. Im by no means saying she did or didn t do either  however  this situation is a slippery slop for sure.
imagine if that happen in real life...oh wait  it also happen in real life
if I cant have you   then my lawyers will ...
thats so horrible that they sided with him. as a former content creator  until recently when personal and life issues made me decide to step away  you donate of your own free will to support the creator and their content. I never expect anything from anyone who I choose to donate to  if I give anyone support monetarily its because I love and support their content not because I expect anything in return.
streamers confuse people  usually guys  sometimes. some of my friends have called them  e-strippers  because they perform for money - almost like tips. and while that comparison is completely unfair  unless they re streamers on a site that ends in  fans  lmao  they are kinda like servers  waiters waitresses.  Imean when I was a server I was overly friendly and sometimes even flirty. any server who says they didn t are lying. lol some of these people confuse this politeness and such as love. its sad but it happens. we all cast wide nets  to varying degrees  and hopefully we ll pull in good people.
when I tell you I laughed so hard I almost died just and the title and thumbnail
bruh the simpery is strong in this one lol crazy how most shame prostitution but seek it w o realizing it.
I sent melonie mac a dollar and she never married me  what the hell
great advice today melonie  love you
one thing they likely would be looking into would be her interactions with him. was she leading him on to get more money  that could get into fraud if she was making him think he would get more of a personal connection with her.
these female streamers when they solicit  donations  who run their stream like they are on a cam girl website ends up causing the donator to expect some form of kick backs. streamers should not acknowledge when they get donations. dont give donators any special attention.
in the culture of arranged marriages is also a culture of commitment and loyaltywe dont have this in the west  which is a shame because finding someone who you cantrust with everything you are is so hard to find but so necessary
stay safe melonie.
regarding relationships  I recommend the holderness family book called everybody fights. its funny and quite good. marriage and relationships take work.
that hair is really working for you.edit  really bad timing for that I just realized what the video is about. Im a little buzzed lol.jokes aside  thats the internet. you should have seen some of the drama in the everquest days no joke. I still cringe remembering a few specific stories lol.
read ms kenner original article her best comment was when its seems too good to be true it is as a cautionary tale for others glad melanie mentioned the subscribestar to support her but having watched this channel since beginning its news to me thatshe sells merchandise there is no link to the store Im guessing its on her original channel she should feature it on show and hopefully create some Bible verse theme items for her fans
acts of hatred are not cool  in general. not nice of fans to have meltdowns like that. Ive thrown it out there that I think youre the dateable type because you just are  attitude and all. if it never actually happened or only ever got to happen briefly then it would not be something that I d ever hold contempt over. people are their own people. Im sort of used to getting burned for working too much and neglecting relationships  anyway  and its taken a lot of personal introspection to even understand it at that level. even to understand that willful effort will be required of myself to maintain the next time Im afforded the opportunity to even have a relationship.not to mention the love hate that big tech and big media already have with my works versus me as a person. I d be super wary about not trying to hurt your career already. not about me  though. right  wherever your future takes you and with whoever it brings you to  you probably deserve genuine happiness  loyalty  trust  faith  etc. with them. the entire rest of your fan base should agree with that as well  if they truly wish you good. good on the Bible quote since it also sort of matches the show topic. carnality has never held any real relationship together and over-focusing on people over what God provides for direction  even in topics beyond carnality  is only ever going to lead to disappointment. agreed.
this guy really expected a relationship  I dont even expect a like or reply. xdbut honestly Im just here to support ya.
I always find it encouraging when you share from scripture.
sad how onlyfans behavior has now ooozed its way into entertainment channles on yt  insta  fb etc..  the simp culture is a sad state of affairs. keep doing what youre doing mel..you do great work. ..and hopefully the simps understand you are not an onlyfans girl...and are not for personal hire..lol
no one owns you becuz they spend money on you!!!! we spend money cuz we love the content you create and the beautiful faith you have. yes youre an attractive and beautifully spirited woman but in this era guys think the more money they spend so you can notice them then in their head they have a relationship with you. I admit Im crushing on you but not to get it twisted that there is something there besides your completely out of my leauge. hope this lawsuitshe is going thru dies cuz its ridiculous and appalling. God bless her and you melonie. keep making our minds going boom!!!
wow such a crazy story. great video keep being you.
and this is why we cant have nice things...
I dont necessarily agree with this take. while I do agree the vast majority aren t e-strippers. there are ones on these sites that are. however  I wouldn t compare them to the service industry. because Im not getting upclose and personal with my server. we might flirt with each other  but at the end of the day Im not going to go home with her. people in entertainment  specifically streamers in this case  you get to know a lot about them over the course of watching them. so its definitely not the same. I know a lot about certain streamers because they literally share their entire life and know a lot less about others because they want to keep it professional. nothing wrong with either  but I wouldn t compare it to the service industry. its not even the same thing.
@alexander mordekai  thats exactly what Im saying  friend .
bahahaha thank you!
people who dont like to hear your testimony can always click away when you get to that point in your video. I pray they stay but he gives us freedom of choice.
wow the sheer hubris of the guy  knowing she has a husband and a child still expecting something in return. Im also surprised the bank also sided with the guy instead of telling him to cut his loses and learn not to have unrealistic one-sided expectation  cause its the internet. and to the people complaining about your messages  grow up....you should know what to expect coming to melonie s channel  nothing is stopping you from leaving a like. closing the tab and wait for the next video  her message will help someone and could make all difference.
never accept money from a psychopath if you accidentally do  make sure he gets his money back with a receipt.
doing what you do is a minefield! good to see your vid with critical drinker....hair s lookin  cool!!!
gotta love the new world huh
I had no idea that you are a Christian  I d love to see you do more videos talking about your faith.
thank you also for your Bible verse of the day - it is the so u le reason I subscribed to your channel in the first place. God bless you  melonie!
these stories always get presented in  dude walks into chat -  drops tons of money -  proclaims to own the streamer now and I have to ask  is this the whole story  was she innocently too extra to her biggest spender with career oportunites for her or did he mistake her for one of the many using twitch as an advert for her off-site 18  services or a myriad of other constelations.
I personally hate some human beings who feel like their somehow better because they stream
melanie....expect a call from my lawyer soon...... just kidding  this whole thing is surreal and disturbing. sorry you guys have to worry about it.
and this is why I decided at the start that I would never take donations for streaming. Imight do a go-fund-me type thing for specific projects  but never just open donations for streaming. of course  this is purely academic because I am a completely nobody  I never broke 3 viewers on twitch  and not sure I have a video with 20 unique views on yt  and no  I am not trolling for follows because there is nothing to follow now  but Imade the decision regardless of any future successes.
its frustrating when people dont understand that paying a streamer is akin to paying any other service provider  be it cable  movie tickets  or a live event. you are not paying for personal time.
I promise to support you and not sue you
the video topic is suuuuuper creeeeepy. thats why I prefer to be out interacting with people irl. what s odd is I know a guy who would fit the same mold as well. I do not understand the mentality of guys like this. I dont know this particular streamer but I really hope she stays safe.
its actually quite scary really.
also  that dude does not have a case unless she made itspecific thatshe would do something for him if he paid for it. otherwise  its the equivalent of a date. it was up to him and she didn t have to reciprocate. dassit.
dang  sounds like russell greer. thatsucks  Im sorry to hear that about the other gal and yourself. you should go on nick rekieta s stream or vice versa  you two would work awesome together I think. God bless and God s speed
I know this must of been asked before but I got to ask how much that life sized laura croft statue cost.
lets be real here mel  90  of the female twitch streamer business is being vague about their relationship status and leading on desperate lonely men.  women like pokimane and amaranthe built empires on this strategy.  these women know they get far more donations if they appear available and single.  Im not saying this particular streamer did this  but its so prevalent on the site that twitch has a reputation as a baby s first camgirl site now.
thats why I never donate money. no sense of false hope. bottom line we ain t dating I ain t giving you money.
I wont take donations cause I dont want to pay taxes on them. it gets really complicated when you start doing that.
or a stripper.  no matter how many dollars you throw at her  she s not your girlfriend.  the rules dont change between professions.  you sit there  quietly  sedately  and think about what s going on in your life that you just threw a week s pay at some girl dancing on a stage in front of you and all youre entitled to is a  thanks  man.   you could have spent that money on anything else  but instead you threw it at a girl hoping she d take you home afterwards.  only one term describes people like that - idiots.
now we all speculate as to which music industry guy is the guy who is harassing her  I have two  either drake or ronnie radke. ronnie streams and has always given me the impression of  huge a-hole . drake because I thought I heard about him making huge donations to a streamer girl in the last year or so  and the fact the bank actually sided with the guy makes itsound like he is pretty famous.
the only way he would be entitled to that money back is if it was  agreed on by both parties as a  gift in contemplation    like a marriage engagement ring is considered   and then she breached that agreement.  i.e. if both parties agreed that he would gift these monies  for a future date  then she reneged on said date.  it clearly wasn t that.
some people think they can just buy anything with money.
society doesnt do anything to discourage the streamer simp relationship.
anybody that is willing to spend thousands of dollars on a streamer is not of sound mind. they do this either to  white knight  or show off in the chat. most really high tippers are likely building up a relationship in their head and think they are buying affection. even in my line of work I dont accept tips because in the past I have experienced customers that tipped me like  20 and called me back with a problem they wanted me to fix for free and got pissed when I  politely  said no and brought up the fact they gave me a tip. they think they own you because they gave you a tip
here I am writing poetry about melonie mac in a my top secret diary  locked in a vault  and trying to summon earth magic to sway ms.boom s attraction in my direction... and literally all I have to do is be overt creep and pay pig...   I prefer using the dark arts rather than being a dork fart  so to my writing dungeon it is!
hearing stories like these and stalker stories from others from twitch make me so frustrated with our society. I believe it goes back to not having father s in kids lives especially boys   not teaching them how to behave in society. another example of 1  making the 99  look horrible.
hey real talk sis I would wait and let this go to court first  because he could have evidence of him   her exchanging text messages  or other activity that would suggest a romantic relationship  anyway God bless   stay safe.
I think the best thing to do in such a case is just refunding the disappointed guy and move on. you wouldn t risk any absurd complication like being sued or stalked and  in the end  he didn t really mean to make donations  he thought he was buying your attention. so I d just say  ok mate  sorry but Im not for sale  so get your money back and we re even  no problem . I know he s the one who misinterpreted reality and its not the girl s fault  but as he didn t get what he thought he was paying for I wouldn t even feel good keeping his money.
damn.... good for him  learned it was a waste of money lmao
maybe streamers should post a legal disclaimer to people who donate and cap the maximum donation per individual per month and how the heck does a bank decide in favor of that   if they agree with the donating person  then they re basically saying that a prostitution transaction is legal and they ll enforce it  which Im sure the feds   police would be interested in.
if someone is so hateful that they cant even hear a verse of the day  they have the option of  gasp  not watching it.
life disclaimer  no one owes you anything. like the hair.
I dont simp for anyone...but  I would simp for melonie mac. lol.
yeah  thats terrifying.
love  on any level  is a choice demonstrated by ones actions.  it is not how one  feels .  positive emotions can be a result of two people choosing to love one another by way of their actions but  the feelings their selves are not love  they are merely the result of love.  having attraction  lust  obsession  or affectionate feelings for someone isn t having love for them.  you haven t loved someone until you have willingly given of yourself to them  or suffered for them  or sacrificed of yourself for them on some level with the full knowledge that the love you have shown them might very well not be reciprocated -- specifically  your love was given freely.  thats basic love.  marital love is this same thing on a whole other level.  that is one reason you can have a successful  life-long union between two people who are in an arranged marriage yet  have two  soulmates  get a divorce after only five years.  with the arranged couple  both parties chose to love one another by way of their actions despite their incompatibilities while  the  soulmates  expected to coast through their marriage on mere compatibility alone without putting in the necessary hard work and self sacrifice.
Im a pagan and have no problem with you sharing your thoughts about your faith. I dont begrudge others for how they commune with the divine. I  personally  find it in the forests and meadows.
expect my lawsuit in the mail  melonie!
unless he was giving money straight to her. I dont know why this wouldn t be something twitch  or whatever the donations went through  would have to deal with since they function as a middle man processor. particularly since they get a cut of what he would send her. if anything  itshould be twitch that has to deal with paying him back instead of the streamer.
we are reaching levels of simping thatshouldn t be possible!
so true. they encourage it. in fact if you dig deep enough to find the rules a lot of streaming sites say they encourage relationships between streamers and members  even romantic ones. you want to know why  because it makes they more money and they know it.
calm down  sir. the crazies are always gonna be around the corner. its okay to have crazy people on society. its expected.
always online never learn social skills  can blame them when this generation ignore young men and tv shows young men as losers
if I had to guess. she got him to do it direct. which is why paypal sided with him. now if it was through twitch  streamlabs which I think uses paypal   or something else. then yes  I agree they should be dealing with it and not her directly. however  if they were able to get the charges reversed.... something tells me not so much.
why arranged marriages are successful has an important reminder.  when you marry you also marry a family.
I was an atheist for most of my life. my family is catholic  but they never forced religion on me. through out my life there were times where I was doubtful but also questioned. Ive spoken to priests and pastures to just pass time and have a new friend. they too never forced religion on me. then one day in my late 30s in 2018...Imet someone who I truly believe is a sign from God. the events that happened leading me to find this person who I now call my best friend were crazy. it now feels like a journey and even like I rescued someone from a monster. I truly believe God wanted me  an atheist at the time  to find another atheist who is almost just like me. and I didn t just save my bestie from a monster  but from suicide. in the end  Im the only one who believes in God and praises Jesus. bestie...not so much. but hey  maybe just like me  all bestie needs is time.
dont send money  send kisses
never be ashamed to talk about your faith. as a matter of fact you know what  a lot of these political groups and sjw movements are allowed to push their negative beliefs on everyone but as soon as you talk about Christianity its a problem ! shows you the times were living in. stay encouraged.
you mean I cant buy your love how dare you
oh  new hairstyle! Im four videos late in noticing  but  Imissed a few  lol. its smart to go natural -- less maintenance and hassle.
dudes  vegas exists and it accepts cash. if you lack the personality but possess the disposable income to purchase affection  hop on a plane and find the first guy standing on a street corner passing out fliers.
the sad truth these people who think just because they pay there owed something its ridiculous but sometimes some female streamers unknowingly encourage this due to greed or selfishness because they ll abuse their sex appeal like I always say the reasons some of these girls are rich is because you eye candy and sometimes your going to attract weird people who are seeing you only for that reason.
if they dont like your verse of the day segment  they can fast forward. I dont find it to be overbearing.
here to catch melonie s video before I watch fnt  I wanted to make a joke  but I had to audible as I listened to the video .
on the one hand  streamers owe you nothing. on the other hand  e-thots getting called out like this is hilarious.
melanie is not a thot. she has self-respect. treat her accordingly.
is that all it takes   well...  expect my subpoena soon!
on the 169th day moses yelled what the crap after God reopened the sea and sees a mermaid on top of the loch ness monster riding him cowgirl style.
well thats really awkward
I think I have a harsher take on this. I cant help but notice that the article doesnt give us any insight into how upfront ms kenner was about the fact thatshe is married. the farthest it goes is to say thatshe has a husband. that combined with the  ms kenner  name as opposed to  mrs kenner   which in fairness  ms kenner could just soley be an alias rather than an actual name  it makes me wonder if ms kenner wasn t one of those streamers. the ones who deliberately never mention that they re married or in a relationship or worse  directly lie and say they re single all with the purpose of trying to get simp donations. the idea is to make them think they ll have a chance with her as long as they donate enough. we all remember the pokimane thing where a bunch of her regular donators were leaving because they found out she had a boyfriend. now  this doesnt excuse the guy s actions. you cant just donate to a girl with the hopes of starting romance and then take them back when you learn doesnt feel the same way. especially since the responsibility of paying the chargeback fees fall on her. thats incredibly scummy. now  if she was 100  transparent about being married  then nothing I said about her holds up. if she was honest about her marriage  then Im 100  on her side. if she wasn t honest about it  then I consider this an extreme form of karma where both sides are wrong because you shouldn t be cultivating this type of audience.
Im not anywhere near being a public figure or famous at all but still there are plenty of wacked out people in the world that you would rather not have to deal with. thats why I have nothing in my name. cars  house  other property  not in my name. I keep my money in a swiss bank. its perfectly legitimate and legal and it gives you an added layer of protection from unscrupulous people.
this is due to the commodification of relationships and was the inevitable conclusion
I wonder what type of state of mind you have to have to think these one sided relationships are real.  Imean  its not like what melonie mac and I have.  dont worry  Im joking!  Im just illustrating how messed up it is to think you have a relationship to someone online that you dont know in real life.  people have to be able separate online stuff from reality.  just because we see someone online on a regular basis doesnt mean they know or have a relationship with us.  the only relationship we have with them is content creator streamer to fans commenters.  it must be scary sometime to be a female online personality.  most of us guys are normal well adjusted individuals.  unfortunately  guys like that make the rest of us look bad.
yet another reason I dont want to do any kind of streaming.I do have a question  are there any private messages that elude to there being more to his claims
bingo! you get it. which is what I stated in my comment. was she leading him on or not  was she upfront about the relationship. you get it unlike a lot of people in this comment section. for that I applaud you and will give you a rare like. which I dont do often.
@vampireslayer83  from what I hear  mostly from this comment section so take it with a grain of salt if you must   ms kenner was pretty transparent about beint married. by no means was she reminding people every day thatshe was married  but she wasn t hiding the fact thatshe was married from what I hear. basically  from what I hear  we have no reason to assume that this guy didn t know she was married.
@vampireslayer83  like I said  was just updating my comment to reflect what I hear. doesnt proove anything either way. the only way to outright prove or disprove it is to watch a lot of her content  which I do not care to do.
@chloe marlowe  Im like you. I dont have a leg in this fight either.we dont have to disprove or prove anything. she does. she s the one being sued.
thats what Im wondering. are their receipts of the conversation between them
if youre not interacting with somebody on an equal basis  entertainer and fan is not an equal relationship  just to be clear  you will never  ever  have any kind of positive emotional relationship with them. just because you obsessively watch an entertainer doesnt mean you know them. people who produce online content put forward a persona that is representative of only a small aspect of their personality. you do not personally know them.also  you cant buy a relationship with anybody. attempting to do so will always  without exception  put the person giving money in a invalid position for any kind of emotionally intimate relationship. this is not a hard thing to know. never give a content creator money if youre expecting more than what youre getting before you gave them money. its not fair to the creator and its demeaning to the donator. give money to support content  not access.
why in the frozen over hell did his bank agree with him on this  they dumb af. they should have laughed him outta there. agreed that the money sent to a streamer content creator is for supporting their streams content  not for a personal relationship   private chats. ppl really need to start learning this  mainly the simp guys  because it is generally always the simp guys doing this who throw all their money at female streamers and then expect a personal relationship   private chats from them and then get mad when they dont get that  and especially get mad when the girl gets in a relationship. your top gifter was most def throwing all his money at ya and those in the know  know it was for those two things and he most def got mad  hence the name calling and saying you dont care about anyone. . super sorry that you went through all that with that idiot and I feel sorry for this girl as well.
he s gone from simp to sue.
also I kind of feel bad  I did put a post about how I felt your segment towards the end where you say your favourite verse of the day  sounded preachy. thats just my perspective  if you enjoy it and from what I take it most of your viewers do as well  you should keep doing it. for those who dont like it  they can just skip it.
watch out melonie. Imight sue you if you dont fall in love with me. xd lolhow ridiculous!
seriously  this guy wants to pay someone to be with them  does he not know there are people out there who are willing to do that rather than expecting it from someone who has not explicitly stated that  probably cheaper too.
this might be a wierd take on the situation you started talking about. in certain areas of the internet  there is a message getting spread by both women and men that all value a man has for a woman is the money or wealth he can bring. without it  the man is not worth anything. if a man believes in thatstatement  I can understand how thatsituation could have been happening  that the man feel the female streamer owes him a relationship. what I feel is very important to push for  is that this is all a lie. the man is not valued by his money. the man can bring something that isn t money or other types of wealth to make him worth to a woman. and the woman does not owe a donator anything. also loves the Bible verses you do. even as a non religious person I feel a wierd calm by listening to verses from different religions  because there is alot of good statements that is universal. doesnt matter if you are Christian  hindu  buddhist or even non believer at all. everyone cantake something from a verse  and apply it to their own life and situation. please keep doing those!
my lawyer will be contacting you shortly. lol
a lot of people should stop trying to date and get a dog. even if you are a slightly negligent dog guardian  the dog will still think the world of you.there s a reason the Bible establishes the opposite of love is fear. love is an action - a certainty  not a feeling or being spoiled and coddled by someone you treat like crap.
I thought you were the gay divorcee  5 wowI dont think the less of you I just want to get together as soon as mathematically humanely possible. you made me the happiest man in the world.thank you for being a friend. and a fiend.
the issue with people saying Christians should be  more forgiving  is that most of the time its not said by Christians and most of the time by  more forgiving  what they actually mean is  more accepting of other peoples sinful lifestyles . the majority of Christians are very forgiving  but most wont accept sinful behavior as the norm  nor should they.
this is what I would say  there is wisdom in all spiritual traditions...yes  including Christianity...but I look to the story of the tower of babel   let us confound their speech that they cannot understand one another  and I wonder if it was to prevent the people of babel from ascending to the level of God  or if their singular vision blinded them to other perspectives that  will have lead them on better paths towards the truth. sometimes  talking to one who sees things differently can change your own perspective  and bring you closer to the truth. food for thought!
how the hell did the bank work in his favor  like how would you even explain that to the bank  I donated thousands cause she promised to love me  but she doesnt so I want a chargeback
gentlemen  remember to sign up for the class action lawsuit against melonie for not marrying all of us. lolz what a crazy messed up place this world has become. the world needs Jesus more than ever.
word of advice for any female streamer  some guy donates 100 bucks to you in a single stream  charge it back to them and politely decline. its not the normal behavior of someone who is chill and wants to throw you a couple bucks to support the stream. most women recognise it for the red flag that it is but turn a blind eye and take the money anyway because they are greedy. dont be thinking some rando is giving you hundreds of dollars just to be nice then be all pikachu surprised face when things start getting wierd and creepy. yeah welcome to the internet thats not how this shit works.
just as these people have the right to donate  you as the creator also have the right to refuse said monies.  and you exercised that right based on the behavior of said donor.  now  like you said  its men and women that have to deal with this  but the pokimanes and amouranths of the streaming world dont help things because they are also  content creators  who live off of their simps and seemingly encourage such thoughts and attitudes.  thankfully  as you said  99.99  of your viewers have common sense about the reality of the viewer creator relationship.  you become a voice for us who are likeminded  and we support your voice through views and subscriptions and donations.
plot twist.  its dj jazzy jeff.
that is one way to do it . just to add to that people will fail you    dont trust your feelings trust God s promises . I also kind of felt lead by the spirit to say the heart of mankind is evil above all things . we canthink we are good people we can be the nicest person on the face of the planet but our hearts are evil . I know that you know this but God s word never comes back void .
when simping goes wrong.
as long as society keeps telling men that their value is based on their money  things like that will keep happening. thats absolutely no excuse for their behavior here  simply an explanation of why they feel justified in doing these inappropriate things. society similarly continues to tell women that their value is based on their sexuality  so there are definitely problems on both ends there. whatever happened to just valuing people as people and  likewise  just trying to be a good person who is actually capable of forming a real relationship with someone that goes deeper than just  marketplace  values   transactions   and  trade agreements
hopefully we see the pendulum swing back towards a focus on virtuous behavior   traits in the near future. this focus on vanity and hyper sexualized women or fake alpha chad dudes is not doing any favors to society or the future of the world. its pretty depressing if I focus on it for too long
wow his bank decided in his favour     thats such bs. this ruling by his banks cant be allowed to stand.  thats a threat to the whole twitch streamer community. now I am not sympathetic in general to twitch streamers but in this case I gotta side with the lady.
what a load!  -- bender the robot
Imean  it has continued to be a donation and free form way to give money.  while sad  its no different than just calling it online panhandling.  one side guises as it  so I can make content   because you dont have to go get a job and can sit at the pc and edit    while the donator can say its for whatever they want it to be.  there isn t a business model enforcing the fact.  its a unspoken social understanding but yt growth being international  you now have cultural understanding issues  see it all the tie in the comments  on how things are interpreted and just a matter of time before the courts are exploited by the simpers or disgruntled against content creators where creators need to start creating self corps. or donation organizations to place themselves behind.  its the creators risk to take. . . just dont throw out a link and say give me money here and thinks everything is kosher.   no legal standing on what that transaction is for or if declared a donation in the first place.  it ll find a way to become more legitimized probably as more cases occur and set precedencies. if creators are drawing a line in the sand declaring money is strictly for offering a  content  services then you also need to legitimize yourself as a business declaring this as such in writing  on file.  but meh  good luck and keep on doing your best.
some people need to stay off the internet.on a different topic where did you get that giant needler  that thing is awesome!
this donor just wants to see her in person. he is sick. stalker alert! I agree with you that I just cant see him winning. it doesnt matter if youre a new Christian or a born Christian. once youre saved youre saved and wont departure. its funny how Christians ask were you born a Christian or did you find God later  as if it matters to God. or it makes them a better Christian. it doesnt make God love you anymore or less. when Christian s forget that lesson they need to be reminded. its not about where you start  its about where you finish. everyone has a different relationship with God. your walk is your walk alone. God knows our hearts. its not for us to prove to anyone else. his love is unconditional.there were these men who knew the entire Bible by heart. they would go around preaching scripture s. people were astounded that they could recall any passage at the top of their heads. God knew that these men knew the Bible. yet  God knew they had no love in their heart s for him. my point is anyone can say they are anything at any given time and have no heart for it. its the personal relationship you have between God and you  I wish I could remember the name of the men or scripture I just wrote about I loved what the guy wrote at 10 02
melanie s just talking crazy in this video! if I cant have unbiblical sex with every female I consensually choose to give money to then what are we even fighting for in life
Im going to have to  sue melonie because  she didn t  fall in love with me  63 year old  man  going bald and overweight
so we re now approaching the point where you can make someone legally obligated to give you their affection I dont want to live in this reverse earth hell hole of a world anymore.
oh you can sue for this melonie mac I ll see you in court!!
as a guy  I gotta say that is horrific that any female streamer has to endure that kind of treatment. to assume that you can buy anyone based on monetary contributions  however large  is basically proving youre not a man  more like a boy who shaves. just saying.melonie mac  youre still doing great - keep going with what youre doing!
I am glad he sued this twitch streamer. while he was na ve  and paid money for the delusional promise from the streamer. most female streamers imply that if you donate you could have a personal relationship with them. that is why pokimane never revealed she had a boyfriend because she wanted desperate lonely men to donate large sums of money to her. melanie you are unique in that you make it clear that donations do not equate to potential personal relationship. while I do not blame women for taking advantage of men since they are able to use their good looks top that end. I do believe that it is about time that men who have been swindled receive justice. what I will say is you are speaking on how you conduct your streams. however there are a good portion of women streamers who take advantage of desperate men with the implication of donations equate to personal relationships. he will probably win  civil court is preponderance of evidence and all he has to do is prove that there was an implication of a personal relationship if he donated. all he has to do is allude to that and he will win. however  he needs to find relevant streams where the implication was there. if she is taking advantage of lonely  na ve men she deserves to be in the red with financial hardship. she should cut the victim crap  this guy is probably more of a victim then she is.
you laugh  but just wait till my lawsuits hit ya  d
God has a way of finding his lost sheep. I  too  walked away. I became an atheist  I was worse than saul of tarsus. God didn t abandon me. his grace pierced my disbelief  and called me back to him.I am still an incredibly flawed individual  but each day is a chance to honor God and overcome.
that twitch guy needs to hear of only fans.I think thats the thing with the underpants and stuff.so Ive heard - so Ive heard.
donating to a streamer can be a very slippery slope.  I can see how the donator can feel entitled to have special access with the streamer  especially if they donate large sums of money.  I now see how these situations usually end up in a bad manner.  the donator idolizes the streamer and gives an offering of money.  the streamer idolizes the money being given to them.  this so-called relationship is doomed from the beginning.  the Bible constantly reminds us not to idolize things and people since it will always replace God in your life.  sorry  but no person or thing can ever replace the love and grace only God can provide.  only he can offer salvation and everlasting life.  I almost fell into this trap buy luckily I caught myself before it became a problem.  I had to cancel all my subs and unfollow streamers that didn t line up with my morals.  I recommend that when we donate to a streamer  we should think of it as if we were in a restaurant tipping the waiter waitress.  its simply a  thank you  I appreciate your efforts  not a  hey wanna talk and hang out sometime    about your previous video  I agree  life can get harder once you fully submit to Jesus.  the reason why this occurs is because satan gets big mad and wants to corrupt you even more.  satan hates you because youremind him of God since we were made in his image.  satan doesnt waste his time on someone who s already fallen since they are doing his job for him.  just saying....melonie  do not ever stop spreading the gospel in your videos.  you are truly bringing people back to God and saving lives.  this is a personal testament.
I am a deist  your Bible stuff doesnt bother me  I think there is a God out there too.    though I still think you should use the king james version because it is more poetic.

wait  we can do this !
dont get me wrong  you are gorgeous and have an amazing personality  but any fan of yours  or any fan of any content creator  that expects anything more than good content from an internet personality is a fool.keep rockin  chica
its always been a thing. you just didn t know about it till now.
this is a second hand story about a couple strangers  with zero evidence offered up. your assumptions certainly make a lot of sense  but we dont know this guy. people often dont behave as if they have any sense. without any evidence  this is just some clickbait nonsense drama. Im just gonna hope whoever the truly injured party is receives justice.
@jeff zeiler   yes  I agree  my only hope is the injured party get justice. melanie mac makes good content  but I feel like she was overgeneralizing female streamers based on her professionalism with donations. the sad reality is some female streamers take advantage of delusional  lonely men and if this streamer really implied that donations equalled a personal relationship I can only hope that he gets justice. and if she is the wronged party hopefully she gets restitution. however I have heard too many times of stories of a couple of female streamers using their beauty to hustle desperate men. so Im skeptical thatshe is the victim in all this. you could argue buyer beware  but at the same time if someone is donating hundreds of dollars thatseems to me like a red flag. she has a responsibility as a content creator to  provide content not take advantage of people. something was clearly up with his large donations. itseems to like she should have refunded the money and blocked the guy for his own good. while she may think she did nothing wrong  she may have  intentionally or not  psychologically manipulated this guy into donating large sums of money.
this is kind of surprising for me  as some one who works in a bank  how he managed to charge the funds back. we never refund any type of gambling payments  unless it was unauthorized or porn or dating charges  which donations would fall somewhere along the lines of. while 99.99  of streamers are straight up about not offering any type of relationship to donators  some go to the grey area  where based on what they offer to top donators  who donate a certain amount of money  they are offered a type of connection with said streamer.  this can lead to a very dangerous situation. the problem is when you have some one who is very lonely donating and they become delusional.
if youreally wanted to get mel  you would donate a Bible and some lara croft action figures. not money lol
wtf is wrong with people. 2022 keeps getting funnier
I was going to make a joke  because its so stupid itshould be funny. its sad we live in a world where these people have to be taken as a serious threat rather than a sad joke.
hImelanie itsounds a bit creepy when people support you by making a donation and them thinking they own you do they not know what the word donation means is it my imagination or is the world getting a little bit weirder sorry I should say a lot weirder even if you get married its  a  partnership its not an ownership.
twitch pay-pigs are wild
only sad weirdos give money to strangers on the internet  they make youtube vids or twitch streams. that is their choice  like f am I am paying for them spending their time doing it.
melonie ifunny community going in on amber turd right now
freaky  glad I dont make my living on the internet..
I dont know....the more I see the poofy hair  the more I like it
new merch -   the truth of the matter
people sue over the stupidest things.
sheesh  melonie mac lookin like a snack
why why this is why I stay single   _   _   hahaha good video !
melonie I liked this video therefore I am entitled to your hand in marriage. p.s. dont tell my real wife.
hey melonie you got a telegram scammer on your channel they even took your picture just letting you know.
oh  dear.  this again.Im a single dude  and dont have too many friends in my local area.  I go on twitch and have traded lines with some content creators  includng women.  but not for a moment do I think that my text  or donations  when I have some free funds  mean anything significant outside of the show I sit in on.I was gonna go on a long  speculative paragraph  but I ll hold off.  too long  took enough of yours and everyone else s time.  thanks.
I find itstrange that people complain about the show you make. do they not understand that there are thousands of other people to watch on youtube. criticize and critiquing should either be a technical issue or when asked your input.
so youre saying there s a chance  d
honestly good on the bank this isn t really a business its meant to be a public space what it turns into commodity is basically the interactions of community so it basically disenfranchises that .takes its money and owes it nothing opportunists abound true  you cant trust anyone but the whole  emphasis of civility is giving others the benefit of the doubt Imean my comments are value as content  that can give others followers or give guidance  give ideas give support..etc but in social media should I start charging people for them  be a paid  reviewer ..because thats an opportunity put them on t-shirt  to buy  thats an opportunity for me etc..its bs my advice on this topic is never spend money on this kind of content ..I dont because the people taking that money will not spend it on you they are more brand than being have fun with it for free Imean if you are monetized and getting a check for something that is pretty t quick fun n and easy to do awesome!..you can kick a ball in a net! you have basic coordination skills its like being attractive basic coordination .but all this  gimme more .. opportunity s there ..super chat ..merch ..etc its all crass exploiting of an opportunity and trying to corner the market as a Christian it all kind of reeks of usury and greed though dont you think  the blm generation generation blm   gimme  10.   I just coined that phrase  and I dont think being good to others is expecting them to forgive me..agree with you on relationships..its work and commitment its not soul  just good for it
isnt that like wire fraud  what he did
dude  you would have loved the 80 s.
nothing major  but I think you looked better with straight hair. well its your hair  so its youre call I guess.
this sounds like a setup to a joke
happy easter!  to any orthodox bros
simpin aint easy!!!
omg the channel aint old anymore
I think he has a case.
its ok to have a crush on someone but if you donate to someone and then think there going to fall in love with you that is the stupidest thing you canthink of doing you should first check to see if the person is in a relationship or is married if they are single then reach out to them if they dont like you move on that dude is a sad sap how you going to think you can buy someone s love lol hahaha.
reading the title hurt my eyeballs. bleach didn t fix it either. what a world we live in. is  romance fraud  even really a thing...
bruh  this is just like the video parody I saw on youtube.
hey melonie I just want to say that I am so deeply and truly sorry that it happened to you. anyway I just want to say that if the female streamers who are already married and who are under age of 30 s or above 30 s and in their 40 s say to a guy that they  female streamers  are not interested in any guys than these guys needs to understand and back off before these guys get busted by cops and get send to jail for harassing and bothering these female streamers and wont leave them along  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say bout this topic and I just want to say that I am so deeply sorry it happend to you and I just want to say that I got your back with any problem that you have with any people who is bothering you and harassing you  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
I dont have headphones on so idk what u said  but the hair is
what  is this for real donation has a meaning  I dont know what did that ytgirl  I dont know.but an adult viewer  wtf  was he trying to buy her what the....
it will get worse before it gets better.
aw for pete s sake. if I had a nice crisp  100 bill for every girl that didn t fall in love with me I could buy both elon musk and twitter.
he did nothing wrong. you owe me 2 dms and an email melonie or I am turning ad block on and reporting to the yt apparatchik
lol its no longer your new channel now
public figure from music industry... well  it doesnt surprise me considering how toxic most of the entertainment industry is  and has been for quite some time now.
9 32that is the major difference between the left and everyone else.
rode that cc for a couple years there huh
I think the whole thing is a shitshow of exploitation  it cant be healthy for anyone involved in these things.
problem is a lot of these girls dont disclose their relationship status in hopes of getting more money. look at amoranth  pokimane  and indiefoxx. they re definitely not disclosing their status.
awchtuwallly....  terrible messed up situation.
what is it with rich dudes thinking they can buy their girlfriends
how the hell did you get my picture for the thumbnail
simpn aint easy
anyone who donates money to a streamer or youtuber obviously has problems.
this is the result of participation trophies..
can you do more verse of the day  I just want to hear more from the Bible
scary stuff.  please be armed.
I watch it because I tend to agree with her way of thinking  channel seems pretty base to me
nothing says how sh!  y you are by thinking something along the veins of  I give money  why you no do me
stop simping or looking for simps  which most do
whoa macster! you look cool as heck today!!
they should ban donations to make the content creator  cream rise to the top.
I used code  mac when I bought gfuel the other day so uhh where would you like to meet.
ummm...how does that work  exactly  I just cant...nope  do not want.
love the hair.
you mean I can get my money back ......lols jkjkjk
what            saturday night bowling is not happening

I can remember all the way back to my first term in prison  funny how things turned out. at least I know I can end it all if I want to.  ironic how people in this world thinks they can get away with it. guess again...   the thing is  that when youre young  you always think you ll meet all sorts of wonderful people  that drifting apart and losing friends is natural. you dont worry  at first  about the friends you leave behind. but as you get older  it gets harder to build friendships. too many defenses  too little opportunity. you get busy. and by the time you realize that you ve lost the dearest best friend you ve ever had  years have gone by and youre mature enough to be embarrassed by your attitude and  frankly  by your arrogance.   this life is what you make it. no matter what  youre going to mess up sometimes  its a universal truth. but the good part is you get to decide how youre going to mess it up. girls will be your friends - they ll act like it anyway. but just remember  some come  some go. the ones thatstay with you through everything - they re your true best friends. dont let go of them. also remember  sisters make the best friends in the world. as for lovers  well  they ll come and go too. and baby  I hate to say it  most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart  but you cant give up because if you give up  you ll never find your soulmate. you ll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. just because you fail once  doesnt mean youre gonna fail at everything. keep trying  hold on  and always  always  always believe in yourself  because if you dont  then who will  sweetie  so keep your head high  keep your chin up  and most importantly  keep smiling  because life s a beautiful thing and there s so much to smile about. people can learn from. their mistakes  but at what cost  Imy self pretty much been damaged emotionally  physically  and mentally.  its a wonder after all this trauma  Im still able to semI function. back to the same goals I had.  poetic justice 3 13 2022 - kidnapping vs abduction. the difference between kidnapping and abduction is that when someone forcefully takes away the person against their consent or will and kept them in their imprisonment for which they dont hold a legal authority is called a  kidnapping . when someone is forcefully compelled or induced and taken away from their home or any other place is called an  abduction .  I guess Ive been both kidnapped and abducted several times in life.3 21 2022 - guess jean has her own opinion about our relationship from the past  no point trying to make jordan try to understand what happened  maybe she will as when she is older and understand more. 3 28 2022 -                1.              2.                3.         4.        5.            6.                    3 30 2022 -                                         ..                                       .                .                                              ..                                       .              .                         ..                                                    ..                                       .                           .                                         .               ..                              .                             .       ...

Imean bruh just pay for  in vegas where its legal. too many men have a disney fairy tale vision of how they deal with women but forget that its a adonis prince thats the object of a fictional girls unconditional love.
get a refund from the sears catalog
streamer sells the girlfriend experience. keyword  sells . lucrative transactional parasocial relationship goes sour. drama ensues.something something name for girls who sell themselves online.
I like ya mel but tipping is a city in china
or is this stalker has so much money why doesnt he just buy an escort
see this is the fall of man right here if this guy had any action he wouldn t be giving money to a woman that doesnt know him. I dont know if this is a modern-day problem or its been happening for years but something s gotta change people have to stop being picky especially women and men have to start realizing that they re not all going to be angels
you talking to me about anything.
looking good...
wait what  he is too desperate. just expose who that popular music industry personality. a yes  means yay! a no means  move on.
when r u going 2b live again
alright guys how do we solve the incel problem  this is starting to become serious.
did you explain to him that this not only fans   make that clear. furthermore  I find it insane that the court would allow such a ridiculous case to proceed. when did break-ups and not dating became a criminal offense
this is just pathetic and sad
just cant quite comprehend why people give thousands of dollars to doctor disrespect. the guy has millions in contracts  and yet asks for donations. f n pitiful  actually.
playing video games on twitch isn t the girlfriend experience. I d understand your case for of  but these are completely different things.
@melonie mac go boom  sorry  misunderstood situation. comment retracted.
unfortunately this has been a thing for years  just different times  different methods! the internet and social media hasn t really helped and is mostly responsible for this pathetic behavior! this dude seriously needs help  and a life!
dude even in of  that kind of attitude is bs  if you give money to someone you dont do it to start a personal relationship
lol what  you support a streamer or personality because you like their content  not because you want a personal relationship with that person.
wow just....wow imagine getting so upset over a married woman who just so happens to stream rejects you so you try to sue her by the way which religion do you follow  I just found you
wtf.
music industry is one big meetoo.  there is a reason cardI b suddenly exploded.was the donator will smith
its a fine line between love and wtf. my advice  for this sucker or anyone who really needs a woman in their life  is work at a call center or a place with a majority female workforce...no joke.
comment  you dont need to give me anything for it btw  lol ppl be crazy out there
pls try boomies instead of boomers
whut. ..lol
what  Im not a religious man but I respect your beliefs  wtf happen to some people!you are not preaching odd stuff  you just have these things in the context of your own faith and I dont see what is wrong with them  you are talking about something that is very  universal .being kind  do unto others and other good ways to be better  not religion  its something that most of us have fixed at the bottom of our hearts cheers
Jesus Christ...! the fact that you have to say  personal relationships is not what I sell  is just gross!
lol then you have to clear it out   not every man is nuts  and you hmm well I dont know your age but if you are thru your 3rd decade you couldn t be my daughter  but its absurd thatsome people basically believe its a question of buying other people.what a pity. let s destroy the whole universe and restart!
did you just call me a boomer
so.... how d the dirty dancing audition go ...
14 06 regarding relationships between Christians and non-Christians  here is corinthians 7 12-14  12    but to the rest I  not the Lord  say  if any brother has a wife who does not believe  and she is willing to live with him  let him not divorce her. 13 and a woman who has a husband who does not believe  if he is willing to live with her  let her not divorce him. 14 for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife  and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband  otherwise your children would be unclean  but now they are holy. I find the notion that Christians should not date non-Christians to be depressing and small-minded. you might as well argue that Christians shouldn t befriend non-Christians. this difference amounts to a disagreement on a very specific set of metaphysical and historical claims. Im not saying that doesnt matter  but its nonsense to say this difference amounts to  incompatible worldviews   when there is so much more to consider. does your spouse fully appreciate you for who you are  support your vision for your life  encourage you to be the best you can be  its possible to do all of these things without sharing religious beliefs.maybe I tend to take personal offense to this sort of thing because I have been in a loving and harmonious relationship with a non-Christian woman for almost 10 years now. the only reason we aren t married is because the idiotic tax code in our state would actually make marriage more expensive than cohabitation. but my family s parish priest said he would marry us if and when the time comes.
this is gettin  out of control
Jesus you look  today
only man differentiates between the differing degrees of sin...God does not. the man who lies is no better than the one who kills  which may sound extreme  but again this is taken from God s pov and not man s. then again  that is why Jesus was not only an example  but also the one on the hook as a substitute for mankind s sin debt  simply because how can one pay for another man s debt when he still has his own to take care of  Jesus can be sinless  but for man it is an impossibility because it is part of our nature  ie. we re literally born into it.tl dr as jordan peterson said there is nothing virtuous about a rabbitsince all it can do is get eaten  but a monster who knows he s a monster  but  consciously  refuses to act like one  that is what virtue is.
Im asking cause I have the same views as you
yes...and let the sexual harassment laws come down on them if he fucks that up.
@vampireslayer83  Ive filled harassment complaints to supervisors on woman before...
Imentioned this in my last video. those are paul s opinions regarding those already married. the Bible is abundantly clear that Christians should not marry non believers.
