I have two questions 1. reva s story  I thought the show was called k-e-n-o-b-i. 2. is there any way that the fandom can criticize this character without being called a misogynist or racist  or was the entire point of casting her simply to use her intrinsic qualities as a shield against the inevitable backlash over the uninteresting and lorebreaking story
they started this crap back when finn was introduced to deflect criticism. the thing is star wars fans were never racist in the first place. if you went to a con  every kind and color of sw nerd was there. the only  rule  was you liked star wars. we were a group of mostly kind goofy nerds who really loved the universe lucas created. people who spent a month painting a model x-wing or built their own lightsaber. fans of all types dressing up as stormtroopers and visiting kids in hospitals. fan who stayed up until 4 am playing star wars tabletop rpg. we kept star wars alive for 20 years in between movies  only for disney to come in and bait-and-switch us and destroy luke and vader. now they re destroying every other original character. star wars isn t for me anymore and thats fine. it just sucks when star wars used to be for everyone.
they re gonna pull the youre a racist card whenever we criticize a character. I knew this was gonna happen the second I saw reva in the trailer
biggest mistake george ever made was selling the rights to disney. it is another example of people who were never fans are now making the shows movies. nowadays I stick with the original 6 films and all the phenomenal  legends  books. I will also try to look past the fact you are a steelers fan.
the same sheep who are congratulating disney for standing up to reycists and saying  but but ppl were going to far.  had no problem twisting the words of a woman who stood up to her bullies  their kind    said we shouldn t let those in authorities divide us. they also had no qualms about the threats and horrific things being said to gina but now they re raging and playing moral  stfu
the bit about respawn employees complaining that cal wasn t either black or a woman or a black woman  double points!  is just... ugh. like  are we not allowed to have a white male protagonist in media anymore  thats the general consensus Im getting from the vocal 1  assholes online. ffs the game featured a black   indian  Im assuming  woman in prominent roles  and a female dathomirI along with several alien species  its not like it was sw  white male fest.
which is rather ironic seeing as though there s been diversity in star wars since the very creation of the franchise in the seventies. mace windu was my favorite jedI from the prequel trilogy. lol
fair and valid criticism is not hate speech. which is something that disney s star wars still has yet to learn Im afraid. lol
thanks for giving my comment a shout    also  never stop sharing the word - its the best thing youre doing on your channel imo. too bad there are plenty of content creators who identify as  Christian  or worse still those who set themselves as leaders and ministers and they are not - because they wont teach the word. sorry - I dont mean to sound so negative there. . . .
they literally have no leg to stand on. they made finn s character take a backseat in the movies and basically hid him in the chinese version of the poster.
ironic sw is calling fans  racist  after what they did with john boyega and even the og darth vader voice himself james earl jones.
I just want to say how glad I am I found your channel.. I love the nutrition and the scripture at the end. this channel is gold thanks!
disney holds no merit when it comes to talking about racism when they literally took a black man out of the chinese poster for force awakens.
didn t they do this before with ghostbusters 2016   if you dont like this film  youre sexist!  - and then red letter media ripped them a new one  analyzing each scene  and pointing out how terrible it was now they re using  the race card . welp... I feel a disturbance in the force...  and great content incoming for this youtube channel  d
well it looks where right on time with the  if you criticize our show youre a racist  card. these people act as if mace and lando dont exist.
this official starwars post was posted an hour after moses ingrem posted on her personal story about people sending her racist comments and private dms and limited her comments which she only showed 4  still not cool but!  and I was kinda amazed someone on her level of stardom by being associated with starwars she would ve not had private messaging activated.
I just started eating beef and eggs a few days ago and already feel better than I have in over a decade!!! thank you for the motivation!! I needed a good push and your content gave me that push! thank you so very much! God bless!!!
perhaps you ve mentioned it before but have you seen sabatu s recent reworking of the original tomb raider  the madman redesigned the whole game from top to bottom whilst really ramping up the difficulty and its superb!
Ive been pretty hard on disney star wars but I wanted to be able to like obi-wan since ewan and hayden were going to be in it. then came the spoilers. sigh. still cant believe reva wasn t ended for her insubordination within the first few minutes of the series.
just look at how popular mace windu is as a character and you can immediately call bullshit on all of these claims.
answer 1. this is subverting expectations from political zealot lucasfilm.2. the latter  they even went into  racist misogyny  stance before the show came out  showing they knew fully well what they were doing and expected the backlash. without having watched anything of the serie I know its storyline already coz its the typical woke blueprint story. take a beloved franchise  then make the beloved white male characters bumble and stumble around and use it as a jump board for the new boring gender swapped checkbox character and in the end get rid of the bumbling protagonist by killing them coz you know   the progressives really hate white men and that message has to be ramrodded through your throat. the blueprint of every woke storyline coz its a npc zombie hive-mind so they cant come up with anything else.
you can dislike a character just fine. its the rascist bull that goes with it.
@seahbeahr  that comes with the territory of being on the internet. its preaching to the choir to just say racism is bad  or harassment is bad. we all agree  but the internet isn t gonna change. so the solution is to be indifferent. encouraging her to ignor the hateful comments like the rest of us do. not make her another victim.
the thing is star wars fans were never racist in the first place.    yes they have.  star wars fans have been racist since  the empire strikes back   when they deliberately misconstrued lando calrissian s actions in that movie and assumed he was supposed to be another one of han solo s faithful sidekicks.
blame star wars fans for that  for the shit he got for the prequels.
legends is canon and disney eu is fan fiction.
@androvsky  star wars  social jedI wamen.but for real  thatshitshould be added to the new volume of the dsm.
except when the hate speech is directed to the actor s instagram  right  because thats the problem. not because you cant critize someone.
@clock  why would she talk about that when the nonsense she s spewing makes a  better  video  her saying thatshe stopped watching star wars because of what happened to gina tells me all I need to know about her.
its projection
shouldn t be surprised at all  since disney is a company with a history of racism to this day.
weren t you guys laughing and cheering when disney did that though
race card  did you not see all those racist comments being posted about her and sent to her  do you suffer from selective amnesia
@clock  oh no! its racist o clock!
@sorinmask  you cant dispute what I said so make a lame joke. typical. lol
or the fact that darth vader  a white character was voiced by a black man and no one gave a shit.  shrugs
@jeffrey mercado  its almost as if george cast jones because of the merit if his deep  commanding  and awesome voice. but because the character was one race or another. Im so glad too live in a time where diversity is placed over performance.
some people think that their crap is really diamonds. they cant comprehend why everyone thinks it is awful unless they can blame hate.
you can basically dismantle their argument by just listing amazing characters from the eu who were either none white  alien or women that they dont even know about.and there are lots of them. or just shoot their own shit back at them like how they hid fin a black character from their movie posters in china because they didn t want a black guy to be on it.
yeah and starwars fans had a problem with them back then too lol
@black recluse  had a problem with who
fine you dont like the character  I dont like the character either  but dont attack the actress.
@big guy617  they struck 1st.
@jeffrey mercado  that doesnt justify the social media attacks
@big guy617  kind of comes with the territory of being on the internet. quit treating her like the victim. what are you gonna if this happens again  say its bad again. not gonna change anything. the best solution is indifference. ignoring these comments like everyone else on the internet does.
imagine back in the day if beloved franchises were purely for virtue signalling  they would have never had a passionate fan base in the first place and never lasted this long. at this point disney is out to destroy every legacy movie and series it owns.
melonie  I hope you see this because I know kinda why this whole reva thing happened  first of all yes to get woke points  second   because since it doesnt make sense to defend a villain character so much  here is what I have heard  she is gonna turn good by the end  thats why theyre making so much emphasis on her  she is gonna be revealed to be good all along  she even will have a chance of killing luke and or obI wan  but she will spare them because a color woman would never do anything bad in any multiverse or galaxy  thats why they want people to like her  so  by saying that if you dont like her poorly written character you are racist  also like one person said above me  if this is a kenobI show why would they give her character so much spotlight     unless she will do something important in the show itself  that is the shield they will use if you dont like reva racism  and id like you to see this because its a leak that has been around  that is probably true given how stupid obI wan has been so far  so if youread this please tell more people about this  because they need to know the cheap game disney plays all the time  im sick of it  otherwise have a great night ly.
if they had simply focused more on making good content and less on virtue signaling they d have had so much more success  you d think a company like disney would put profits over politics!
looks like twitter is drumming up more drama for likes   retweets. meanwhile  birds still in fact fly
love your accurate carnivore information.
wow they are stepping it up a notch. calling me rah cyst before I see the show or say anything.
former vegan here. I used to ask a ton of questions on the vegan subreddit and got nothing but essay long hate comments and downvotes. I was in itsouly for my love for animals but got completely shot down by the people. it doesnt add up
its so annoying that all of these companies can just openly hate on their consumers while they bow down to actual racism from countries that dont tolerate their nonsense.
reva hmmm is this the rebirth of darth revan a storyline that may actually be interesting   explain her power   give a reason for others to hide her from history once she s taken out.
obI wan has 6 episodes for something interesting to happen. so far he s been working at a factory making giant blocks of spam while trying to relearn his force powers. they can play the race card but other than mandalorian they ve done nothing but take a massive bowel movement on my childhood.
becoming diabetic made me have to revamp my entire diet.  I had to switch to an 85  meat based diet to cut as many carbs possible  from a balanced diet of 50 50 before.  it wasn t hard because I like meat  though there are times Imiss spaghettI and pasta  but I ended up losing 40 lbs and living rather than dying.  I subsisted that way for ten years before I finally got regular insulin pens.  its unfortunate in that Ive had to compensate for the dietary change with pure carbs to handle the glycemic lows  but I do run a borderline pre-diabetic a1c.  I have been trying to find ways to kick back up towards the 85   but the economy and concerns about hypoglycemia plague me.  still  watching you has helped by giving me ideas and suggestions that I am willing to try.  its important any time you take advice to monitor your own health  because the human body does not instantly adjust to new things.  it will adapt if its able  you just have to be patient sometimes.
your race card had been declined because it has reached its limit.
you need to give some blame for the taste and nutrient levels of modern vegetables to places like walmart. Imet with a tomato farmer once and I indicated that I hate tomatoes and he responded with laughter. he said he wouldn t even eat the ones he grew and that I should try the ones in his personal garden. he explained that places like walmart will sometimes refuse payment on shipments from farmers that contain too many bruised veggies  which has led to them being selectively bred for tougher skins rather than flavor.
it comes across as the studio doesnt have confidence in her acting and is gaslighting the fans to defect from the studios casting choice.
still trying to get my sister to do the dino diet
no franchise despises its own hardcore audience like star wars.
if this ever reaches china  will they remove reva from the footage
sweet I love seeing you wearing a pittsburgh steelers beanie.thats myteam aswell.takecare melonie
gina  had to read the prepared statement. just like everyone else.
for americans  profits are politics  and vice versa.how can you expect freedom when companies and government collude
pretty sure they know better than you how to maximize profits both in theory and in practice.
@gabriel cook  I was going to give you a serious response but then I read your other comment lol  I think you dropped this
@duskwalker68  must ve hit pretty close to the mark to have triggered you so.
@gabriel cook  ah yes  because mild amusement and dismissal of your comment is  triggered . if youre going to try adopting right wing terms to flip them on people  at least use them correctly so you dont look like an idiot lol
@duskwalker68  the way you saw this reply  and then saw the other comment and replied to both seems in the realms of triggered to me.especially when you cant even address my points. are you offended thatstar wars called you racist

when I look back at return of the jedI  the phrase   truth is just a point of view   sets up all this crap.  it makes the scene with obewan and anikan in the last prequel pain-full.
one problem I have with eating an egg everyday is after a week I start to feel almost sick at the taste of egg...
when they say thatstar wars are not inklusive movies  it makes me wonder if they even saw 5 minutes of one!
obI wan vs darth vader fight on the obI wan show was the best live action fight scene in star wars history
disney is going to be losing a lot of money with these shows  I wont be giving them a dime anymore.
its okay. star trek has been working on all cylinders.
any character thats shoehorned in a game or movie for wokepoints is a character I automatically dont like by default.
what else are they gonna do thank the fans
mace windu is one of the most beloved characters that isn t a main character by star wars fans. disney and now lucas film has decided to become political and as far as Im concerned nothing they produce should be considered canon.
so its not obi-wan s story
we dont so much have a  toxic fan  problem. we have a  toxic creator  problem. these people seem to think that we owe it to them to like what they create  and that if we dont  we re to blame. they dont seem to understand that it is their job to create what we like  not our job to like what they create.
melonie I thought I was getting a 35 minute video about my favorite franchise. I got click baited into another nutrition video lol. am I shocked  no not at all.  I use to believe boycotting never truly worked for anyone right of center. I would hear people in my circles say they are boycotting  company x for y woke reason. within the month they would be right back and x company.
looks like they missed the stop racism! hype train from back in 2010 football world cup
steelers merch made me smile
I also stopped giving them money after gina. the identity shields are  getting really  annoying.
Im 48 and I dread doctor visits because I get told to take long walks and to avoid red meat.  I get told Im an old guy and to consume only veggies. veggies only sucks. I feel much better after a nice juicy steak dinner.
you make the steelers look good  mel  but as a man of principle I have to say  red and gold til Im dead and cold  baby! go niners!
eric july  rippa 59  fell asleep  literally on this topic  go check it out. much luv mac!!
that tweet takes away from all the work that actress put in for the show.  calling all of us racist and treating us like children just because her skin is darker than mine.  youread the first sentence and youre like   yeah  cool!   then youread the second sentence and youre like   nah  I ll go do something else.
every time this happens a certain percentage of the people they unjustly call racist will just go  ok  fuck it  Im racist now.
they are snowflakes that were never told no.
imagine any other time in history you could use contemporary cultural issues to completely shield your art from criticism. you are racist is you disagree with our direction  suspect our obvious agenda  or complain if the character the show is named after is a tertiary character...  why are the sw fans so toxic !  here is our new character  you racist bigots who may not have seen the show yet!  racist  has been a catch-all for  anyone I dont like  and a shield against criticism for six years now.
in any way    really   so you are dictating who we have to like  Im enjoying the series but yes there are some issues. not nearly as many as all the angry youtubers are saying. just watched episode 3 and its very good. its really good.
on facebook   yea im old  p   theres this starwars  fan  page that made a posting on this.... the admin and thus most of his ...followers... are pro disney and antI fandom menace  of which he calls  fandumb menace  and has on occasion wrote insultingly of g g jeremy and other such channels and personality . personally I think people have rights to having their own opinion  but God help u if u even try to be neutral or in the middle  let alone pro fandom menace... the incessant gaslighting  roundabout arguments to shame u and imply unless u go full  I support the current thing!  you are just the same as those who are outright and clearly bigoted. there cannot be nuances with these people. a guy asked   are people allowed to dislike a character if portrayed by a minority are people allowed to dislike an actor despite their ethnicity are people allowed to say a person was hired for alternative reasons as they are not the best person for the job  and I can barely see a response  by the site admin and their followers  that isnt insinuating or trying to imply the guy asking is in fact actually being a racist. just by asking these questions.
you do need dietary balance  between all the different animals  d I also unironically like a daily apple
star wars  what s that   Im gonna see top gun maverick.
lucasfilm and disney s hatred of the huge fanbase is legendary  even in hell
wow !!!! I just watched it and its just awkward not because of the woman being black but because she has way more info about vader than possible and obiwan is portrayed as a gutless coward it would be like someone telling us our hero s like geronimo was really a gutless coward and was scared to death of an unknown white girl
she just comes across as entitled  like we should just love her. no I wont  your acting was embarrassing and your character is badly written like the cliched dialogue you butcher.
I checked out of star wars discourse a while back. I ll stay in the loop because Ive been a fan since childhood  but damn  so much infighting and mediocrity
they have to do something stranger things and maverick left them in the dust
I eat a mostly keto diet. was wondering if it was a hard transition to the carnivore diet
1am central is the afternoon in beijing... just saying  they know the audience that pushes for this kind of woke  divisionist thing in the west.  and I just checked  they were getting plenty of engagement during the american off hours for social media.
star wars hasn t been the same since disney got a hold of it...
whats a good keto snack  I was looking at jerky but most jerky has a ton of added sugar  I am thinking about just making my own but what do you snack on
I am a poc. Im only here for that dilf hayden Christensen and daddy ewan not reva or moses. disney sw   their new fans can cry till their throats are dry.
lol of course they are. I really dont mind reva being black at all. it would be kinda weird if all the empire or  dark siders  were just white people and aliens. I just found it comical thatshe was flipping around like a gd power ranger going after obi-bro kenobi. the  chase scene  with kid leah was comical too. it just seems like disney is bringing disney channel drake   josh kind of quality to star wars.  it wasn t all bad. I love ewan mcgregor. he was born to play obi-wan the same way patrick warburton was born to play the tick.disney  stop using black people as human shields against criticism. yeah there s going to be racists that are unhappy  that doesnt excuse you from criticism though.
this video is 60  diet and then the actual title topic  d. maybe you should do a diet channel. I used to be fat  autistic and sick all the time  carnivore was the first time I feel energy waking up and I was like  so thats how those cartoon characters feel  because in media they allway portrait cute cartoon characters as energetic in the morning  but I always asked why I cant have that.I dont know if you have ever tried raw carnI but maybe its great to dig up some research on that and maybe try it out one day. from my experience  raw carnI is basically the upgraded version of carnivore  like  super carnivore    xd
can I get a link to her keto paleo diet video
I hadn t even heard anything about token characters. I just haven t been watching because I was so disappointed with enough of their other recent additions to the franchise.
there is 20 million sentient species in the star wars universe but all the movies are about a slaves from a desert planet
do you need a tissue little one  lol!
@heavy honey  I dunno. need a remainder that youre still alive  old man
Imean  obi-wan didn t exactly try to face the entire clone army single-handed...and trying to lay low usually means avoiding conflict and situations where you ll look suspicious.
was pretty easy for me  I started keto before carnivore
I stopped watching and reading new star wars and canceled my disney  membership because of what disney did to gina carrano and how they handled thatsituation. actually Im pretty much done with anything out of modern hollywood. I dont want a single penny of my money going to any of those companies that are pushing this woke agenda thatseems dead set on destroying america and men.
lmao they were mad at the fans because the fans were being racist to 3rd sister  and they were mad at gina carano because she was being racist to jews.  they re pretty consistent.
oh no you are a steeler fan. cool points times 1000. I followed them since sb ix.
star wars was not only multi-racial in the beginning  it was multi-species
try kodiak flap jacks  they are high in protein.
I dont know if you ll see this message  but I pray you do and I get an answer. I started on the carnivore diet  Im in ketosis  but Ive hit a plateau for the last 3 weeks. which is typical of all diets. I lose about 30lbs and then nothing more. this is the 3rd time Ive tried keto carnivore  Ive tried going through stomach surgery and optavia  etc . well Im now bedridden and am desperate. Imust lose major weight fast. I am going through the process of stomach surgery  but I d rather change my diet and do it naturally. Im torn. why am I not losing weight  what am I doing wrong or missing  if I knew what I was missing I wouldn t go through surgery.
if any of melonie s vegan detractors are lurking around here  id like to ask why melonie is so healthy and vibrant if her diet is as destructive as you insist it is  you d think she d be dead by now if that was true.
carnivore diet  day 4 now  used to do it last year and loose alot of weight but not dedicated enough. wish me luck.
people aren t having valid criticism of the character  look at what people are tweeting her. its solely based on her race.
I dont go around telling people Im not racist because I let my actions do the talking
im surprised they didnt get made at china for taking chewy off instead of minimizing the black guy and aligning him with the others.
Imiss you george  when we had a leader who cast poc and women for their skills and good story lines  instead of doing it to defend and project their certain image like disney. Ive continued to watch star wars  but after the continuance of disney s agenda I dont intend to watch anything else.
if it doesnt apply let it fly  simple
probably the most stupid thing about them calling us racists and all the other nonsense is thatstar wars before it was owned by disney was actually more inclusive  less racist and far more diverse with strong female or non white characters since thatseems to be the thing they like to focus so much on.my problem isn t with female characters or non white characters my problem is with poorly written ones or ones just there for the sake of diversity. and reva is not a great character and I dont like her not because she s black but because she s poorly written and for her actor to make the claim thatshe s better and more powerful then vader is just a bruh moment lol honestly.and its funny that disney claims to hate racists when they themselves took fin one of the main characters of their movie basically took him off hid him on the movie posters in china because china didn t want a black guy on the poster. thats kinda racist.o and the bar scene from a new hope alone had more character and species diversity then almost the entire sequel movie trilogy. so what s thatsay
good stuff
there are people who have legitimate criticisms of moses s acting but some people s critique is that they think moses is in star wars because disney wanted to put a black actress in star wars. in other words  some people think she s there because disney is woke. I ultimately disagree with this mindset since its the same mindset that the sjw s use. the sjw s observed that there were a lot of straight white men in movies  so they deduced that it was indicative of misogyny. on the flip side  these get woke go broke people conclude thatsince disney is including more black women  they think its indicative of the woke agenda. both groups are making prejudicial assumptions about what they think and they re both being biased sjw s at the end of the day. its a terrible assessment of the situation and its playing the leftist s game.
27 08 - to answer this question  no  we would not have any issue of meat shortage if the world switched to carnivore diet.  just think about the hundreds of millions of farm acres currenting being used for crops.  those would be converted to grassy pastures to raise livestock instead.  some crop acres would need to remain for corn  wheat  and oats as they are used for livestock feed during winter months.
I saw a bit on reditsome saying about a new lando tv show and I said that of course anyone that doesnt enjoy it will be called a racist and got called a racist for saying that
hey mel!youregularly say you prefer anecdotal evidence to scientific studies.the thing is  as a scientist here who has taken a strong interest in nutrition  most nutrition studies are extremely bad and use terrible methodology.the issue is not the scientific method but biased people and self reenforcing beliefs.
is melonie a pittsburgh girl !
I d need to know more of what you are eating  but usually if people stall on carnivore its because they eat too much dairy. dairy is not good for fat loss. try eliminating some stuff and eat nothing but beef and eggs for a bit  then after youreach your goal you can add in other things and see how your body reacts
funny  I asked this question on her instagram  and here too  where I was sure thered be vegan detractors lurking about  but no one seems to want to answer this simple question.
uh Im seeing people criticizing her acting  her character s bad writing and her arrogance of claiming she s the first blk character. I literally have twitter open right now..what are you smoking
@alicia norayan  I have to be smoking something because I saw something that you didn t I  dont have a dog in this fight dear  if you want to be mad about  wokeness  by all means help yourself  doesnt change the fact that there were numerous actually racist tweets aimed at this lady. your welcome to use google or siri.
thats not what your original post says  you claimed there was no valid criticism   thats a lie.
@cyborg647  fair point.  in addition to the criticism of the character  there have been a numerous racist posts on her timeline.    there you go
@alicia norayan  I guess we re seeing different comments on different platforms then lol
@alicia norayan  Ive seen alot of racist comments towards her.
racist if you dont like the new character seems oddly targeted.tragically drawing attention to the character  and the actor.Im sure I ll enjoy all the new shows  I just will only watch them if my friend still has disney  and I end up spending a night or two there watching their dog.
7 23 you know what s good for soil  livestock. they eat all the grass and weeds and herbs  poop it out to replenish the dirt  and then stomp all around to redistribute the goodness. plus  the soil becomes good for all kinds of bugs and plants and circle of life. thats why red meat is good. eat meat.
blackandyellow
why are vegans so mean  misery loves company. I celebrate earth day every year with a fat  juicy steak cooked on a barbecue.
hating starwars characters isnt new  remember how much hate the actor for anakin got in the phantom menace and evan mcgregor never made a video defending him and that was a child or jar jar binks actor getting hatred and no one defended him.
hey  my ornery butt started playing bass guitar at church...yay.
chewie disappears on the chinese poster.
steelers  baby!
maybe elon musk can buy star wars and make it great again lol
commenting to feed the algorithm
when the creators of a media dont give a shit about their audience  the audience should stop giving a fuck about the media.
its not thatshe s a black woman its that her character is annoying and awful. if they hate us fans so much then we can show them how we feel with the absence of our money.
its a trap. I am sure the new character is good  but putting out a post like that is goating people into reacting. majority of fans and people just want a good story.
Im starting to think you might like the steelers...
dude calling fans racist and asking a portion of the fanbase being racist to not be racist isn t the same thing.  guys have thicker skin. unless you feel called out cause your actually racist then it doesnt affect you and they re not talking to you
watch the internet play a reverse uno card and say  making the black person sith is racist
I ll pass on the reva or whatever its name is.
I am done with disney star wars  Im still raging from the sequel trilogy.
ugh youtube. anywho started carnivore before doing hrt dropped 70 lbs before it and didn t get much weight increase with the increase of estrogen in my system. lovely diet.
did you see john campea video on this hmm.
pretty sure there were fans calling her racial slurs and making racist memes towards the actress...
@black recluse  haven t been following the disney sites I guess.didn t even know she was in kenobI until today s comments were being retweeted. xd
from what some comments are saying the actress had been getting actual racist comments and hate like hayden Christensen did
@yu lee
@                         why do youreply with emojis so much
@yu lee  I cant be bothered talking on youtube anymore  they delete half my comments.
@                         wow
aren t they supposed to be promoting obI wan kenobI  didn t see it mentioned once all I heard was  black black black black!!!!
I think there point is thatsome people are being racist in there comments to moses  same as they did to kelly tran. they can say they dont like her acting  but they dont have to make racist comments.
they all but erased flynn. he was important in awakens  then  nothing.
this is not about the actress or her race. this is disney and lucasfilm using her as a shield to avoid criticism about her poorly written character. besides  blaming the performer is the oldest trick in the book. if they knew her acting was flat  why didn t the person in charge say something  what is the point of having a director if youre not going to be direct  and as for the writer who made reva  you suck! and all this racism they projecting to fans. is bs! so if they dont want to listen and continue to patronise customers  all I can say is  whatever
the virtue signalling has only just begun. s tier signalling begins tomorrow   prepare your eye rolls
Im so sad that now there is more bad star wars than good star wars
the emperor getting killed by an untrained  jedI  with two lightsabers  are you f-ing kidding me ! he killed three jedI by himself in rots. disney didn t just jump the shark  it jumped a full grown megalodon. there s a difference between someone going down the woke rabbit hole and someone going into a woke black hole. if anything gets pulled into a black hole there s no escape forever. thats what disney has done  they ve gone so woke there s no going back.
any thing star wars now I stick with the prequel and original trilogy followed by the eu with the madalorian war  hyperspace war and the hundred year darkness cause that is true star wars storytelling. their mission is clear to destroy the franchise in the name of wokeness. ruin beloved characters  erase lore to replace with activism.
how do they know she is black  you d need both a biology and art degree to prove it.
steelers !  thats minus 1 point
you mean the character with 0 depth that does not even make sense in any way shape or form
if you like star wars but dont wanna give disney money just pirate it lol
I have black people in my family and a past boyfriend and a blind boy from cap and a blind girl from camp that I would literally die for. call me a racist ! say hello to my fist because it becomes lethal under the proper circumstances.
no way im watching a show thatsidelines the main character that advertisements falsely teased  the whole reason my interest peaked to begin with.
they fired gina carrano because after multiple warnings because she kept saying stupid offensive stuff.nice straw man  though.
go steeler s
dont care if she s pink with purple polka dots the character is horrible and her acting is really stiff...she could take lessons from wesley snipes in demolition man or alan rickman in die hard or robin hood on how to be a good villian
I get it you are beautiful. quiet ugly shaming me.   take my comments as a joke.
dont ever watch book of boba fett. I guess the sarlacc pit turns you soy if you get out.
uhhhh riva the first black character in star wars ever  like black panther was the first black comic hero in a movie  just forget everything that was before the 2000 s
she needs to watch old star wars movies  and cartoons and see better villains. imperial officers are more scary when they are controlled and not unhinged.
everyone should cancel their disney  subscription  boycott disney  never watch a disney marvel movie again
dont worry lucasfilm.  I wont say anything negative about your new actor and or character because you wont be getting a fucking dime from me anymore so I cant watch it to find out if I like her or not.  you can go on being racist pieces of shit to your black actors while accusing your fans of racism all you want to score points from weirdos but for me  I noped out a long time ago.
if you dont want star wars calling you racist  then you probably shouldn t be racist.
because these fans are either racist  sexist or both.  what the hell did you expect   Ive been aware of racism within the star wars fandom since  the empire strikes back  and the reaction to lando calrissian.  and Ive specifically been aware of sexism within the fandom since  the force awakens .  stop trying to pretend that this kind of behavior doesnt exist within the star wars fandom.  its just makes one look like an idiot or worse  a bigot who is trying to pretend that bigotry doesnt exist.
of course starwars fans are racist lol the same people who had a hard time accepting lando  finn  windu and james earl jones  the voice of  darth vader ...
second! pittsburgh stillers!
I think its about time to just let star wars finally die
disney have been on a sandcastle stomping spree for the last 30years.
its not star wars  its disney. they have totally destroyed the star wars ip. because their diversity ideology  poor writing  poor casting and dumping on the star wars legacy is not going over well with the fans  disney resort to race baiting.
such a pretty girl  such an ugly hat.  whodey  p
well depends on how you display the hate. I dont like her character but I dont support attacking the actress. that is not right. why cant you attack kathleen kennedy instead. I am sick of these reactions from fans.
he character the actions  and pretty much everything has been pure trash. they dont understand their own property or things within. obviously a race hiring and the actor hasn t impressed me on acting alone  she sounds like a whiny young angry anakin  obI is  bum now who forgot training his whole life in a few years where he can barely levitate a child  meanwhile she s jumping building and being very angry and lippy to a grand inquis  with unrealistic reprisals. disney is the worst company and Im glad I dont pay for their sub or give them any money or views. woke trash company  so sad for star wars and marvel what a travesty. should have made a show about mace windu and the years afterwards and left obI alone for the most part. that would have satisfies their quota and interested more than a few.
ask a star wars fan what they think about mace windu. everyone loves him. he s cool  he s strong. and got a purple light saber. why  cause the actor did amazing playing him  and george wrote him beautifully. moses ingram is a great actress. reva is a bad character  and was poorly written. she could have been great. but she wasn t. star wars fans aren t racist. we re tired of back writing and story telling at the expense of  woke  propaganda
disney star wars is trash.  Im done with all of it
hey melonie I just want to tell you that I am sorry for having this comment late for your video from yesterday but I just want to tell you and say that why do woke people have to make a mean comment about this star wars movie and television show series  anyway I really like the star wars movie and the television show series and so I just want to tell you that I really love and like star wars movie and television show series  ok melonie. anyway also I just want to say that I dont know why there is a racist problem in this star wars movie and television show series  I do not have any problems with racism or racists at all  ok melonie. anyway everyone is different by color but everyone is God s little helper by his grace and faith  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to make a comment about your video from yesterday  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home with your pets and at gym if you do go to the gym today  ok melonie. anyway have a great day melonie.
shit is so lame.... if you lead with the notion that you have to like her because she s black  this immediately sets the tone that the character may not be very developed or interesting  and maybe even disney knows it. so  naturally they go the  youre racist  route if there s any criticism. give me a damn break. reva should stand on her own two feet and they shouldn t even need to put this kind of statement out. just stop this woke shit...I wonder if half of those 115k likes even watch the damn show.also the steelers colors look good on you but green would be better. go eagles
I had low expectations for this show but damn  its worse than I thought.writers are shit. nothing to do with actors  I actually like the kid leia actress  character is just shit  and the grand inquisitor  derp character . but writing is... crap. thats all.star wars died some time ago
its like seth rogan all over again  blame the audience. starwars was on the decline for years then disney bought it and now its fawking dogsh!t  woke garbage.  the last good starwars film was rogue one.
...isn t lucasfilm hiding behind black people as an excuse for bad writing racist...
ba-bye!
difference between not liking a character and spewing racist slurs and hate towards the actor actress...
boooooo steelers!
obi-wan is my favorite jedI but this show sucks and its extremely boring and to the people saying that it only has 2 episodes I ll give you all a reminder that it will only have 6. moses ingram acting is terrible and her character sucks. it has nothing to do with her being black. and I think star wars fans are pretty accepting of everyone we just dont want forced agendas shoved in our faces and want well written stories with great characters.
less reeeeeeeeva  more obi-wan. her character is boring and she lacks real menace. maybe she will get more interesting later but she s dull so far.
412!
first
screw star wars
star wars is dead to me. it bores me.
some of them are racist. having said that  her character is pretty badly written and acted.
star wars is dead! old school space opera is better!
big shock  if you dont like their tripe you must be a racist. nothing at all to do with the weak writing  character revamps  and plot holes...
nah I genuinely think it is called for this time  there is actual racism the actress is getting. its almost the same as hayden chrsitensen except the actress is black so now she is getting racist comments. you cant wash this one away.
oh no  Ive found myself on white supremacist side of youtube again
hooray!!!
@none of you matter  why are you putting words in my mouth  the gina situation was dumb as well. two wrongs dont make a right. and if anything the hate gina got was more on the corporate side rather than fans hating.
cope
@j luck   that times 2
