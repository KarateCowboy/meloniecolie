Im not even Christian but I just love how yourespect your faith and religion. your videos are excellent melonie! thank you for making them! Im your biggest french fan! also Im learning english a lot when Im watching your videos!
Im a Christian  but I sin. every time I do  I feel horrible about it. I ask God for forgiveness. what I dont do is demand people celebrate my sins.
Ive been feeling a pull towards faith again the past couple years.  Im interested in hearing more and more about it.  thank you for being a brave  strong Christian.
how did anyone who was involved or who allowed this to happen think this is a good idea
always  always  always appreciate it when you stand boldly on the front lines and speak the biblical truth! truth  by definition  is exclusive. there s no  variety of ways  to get to heaven  nor does God condone sin and perversion. calling depravity  variety  is just man trying desperately to justify sin.bless you  melonie  for everything youre doing! praying that God will keep his hedge of blessing and protection around you
non-binary priest   tee-hee! God loves varietyyy! God   its time to choose a variety... of new plagues. Im starting humanity all over again.
non binary priest   straight up sacrilege  -- you have a way with words  melonie!
melonie  videos like this have been some of the most instrumental catalysts for re-discovering my own faith. please know that this type of content from you is incredibly appreciated and is truly making an impact on others. unknowingly  I lived a life full of sin for over a decade  and I completely resonate with some of your own personal experiences in regard to suffering. for the first time in my life  I am learning the Bible every night and have started to truly understand the gospel. thank you for being brave enough to speak out against the true evil in this world. much love and respect.
youreally poured your heart into this and itshows. thanks  melonie.
as a fellow Christian let me just say  best go boom video yet. speaking about your faith like this can be hard so thanks for making this melonie
thank you  melonie! I always appreciate this content  and appreciate yourelying on God s strength to deliver it!
I struggle so hard with my faith that I haven t considered myself a Christian for years. but I still really respect   appreciate good Christians with strong faith  like you melanie. and I think one of the best ways to evangelize to people is simply by being a good example of a Christian  let those around you see the goodness of your faith   belefs and be inspired by it  and that alone can make Christ more appealing to them.
you can rest asure that this did help at least 1 person. thanks you. Ive been struggling with my Christianity for a long time.  recently I feel like God I d speaking to me  louder than ever and Ive  even rediscovering things. to long to type here. but I 100  get where you are coming from with so much of this. thank you for making this.
melonie  I always appreciate your videos where you share your faith. it takes a lot of courage.
as someone often around many lgbt people or lgbt supporting  both Christian and not  this really helpsive always had trouble when it came to offending people or the thought of it  but thanks for helping me stay rooted in my faithIm trying to grow closer because Ive been in a lil rebellion phase but Im hoping I can gain all the knowledge I need for the futureit helps that I have my sister who s rooted in faith right beside me the whole time helping me not to drift
ok  Ive listened to this twice thru while looking for the leopard .  good work  melonie! I feel like my time and money are worth it for this. dont quit gaming and culture videos  its just once in a while you have to enjoy a great steak of a video
I cant love this enough. well said in a respectful  loving way. thank you for your vulnerability.
I love your Christian posts.   especially when you get right into the word.   keep up the good work. God bless you.
thank you for sharing your story  melanie.  I ll be 37 soon and at times I feel distant from God  so its good to see someone else who was a prodigal child too.
this was a great video melonie!  as one of the people who misses the  verse of the day  from your earlier videos  I nevertheless very much appreciate the explanation as to why youreplaced it.  yeah  its never good to try to force-share the Bible  and neither is it good to not share the Bible due to fear.  the ideal is to draw near to God daily through prayer and reading the Bible  and naturally God will direct us to speak as he directs.  it might at times still be difficult to speak the truth to those who need it  but true Christian will never regret it!  keep speaking the truth  melonie!
thank you so much  that means a lot and I appreciate you watching
its outrageous. the mentality seems to be  Im not wrong  God and the rest of you are wrong  and it is a wild amount of blasphemous narcissism.
I apparently sin just existing
quit lying about feeling horrible about your sinning. if you truly did feel that way  you would stop! but you do not because you enjoy sinning.
as a muslim  I cantell you that there s a difference between a person who feels bad about sinning  after a  what have I done   moment  and those who dont only just dont care  they continue to do it. as long as you acknowledge you ve done wrong  ask for God s  st  forgiveness  and stay far away from said sin.
@johnny storm  be a bit respectful since we dont know what goes on in this guy s life  or what s in his heart.
@omaralikaj  satan is chomping at his weak-spirited heart. and shame on you! its this type of nice leniency that has caused the fall of the Christian church.
@johnny storm  I agree  this person needs to stop sinning  but  we all will stumble  its why Jesus died  its not an excuse to sin  but  we have that reassurance when we do. the Bible says when we correct someone  to  do it in love  I have to say  the way youre rebuking this guy isn t the way  be an en couragement  not self-righteous about it
I want to encourage you to grow your faith  and read the Bible everyday  to go forth and sin no more  I will pray for you
thank you so much! please hop in my discord server at discord.gg meloniemac and ask to speak to spider-dan  he is one of the prayer leaders there and he is so amazing at answering any questions you may have as well as praying for or with you if that is what you want. God calling on your heart and it is beautiful that yourecognize it. God bless!
God calls to each of us in different ways and at different times. pick up his call and ask for some guidance. as society becomes more Godless everyday  we need him now more than ever.
I really hope that variety does not include maps. even satanists would rebel.
@zoloft77  that honestly depends on what kind of satanist we re talking here. the kind Imingled with when I was younger would object heavily.  laveyan satanists  they are usually very protective about their kids.other kinds  Im really not so sure. balenciaga and all.. who knows.
@max  first church of satam type. so  yes. the kind that respect consent and the development of will. children do not have a fully developed will and cannot consent as an adult would.
@zoloft77  most seem to just exist to be edgy.
read the gospel  its what you need to do.
its been going on for years now in the anglican and episcopalian churches  though this has been more accelerated in the episcopal than in the anglican church.
if this dude djd this in islam. this dude is probably headless by tomorrow. Christianity is too much tolerating for its own good nowadays.
because  tolerance . this is the kind of stuff tolerance leads to  being  nice  and  accepting  is not virtuous.
@anonymous cheese  tolerance  is one thing but you need to follow your own scriptures as well because  hypocrisy  is that another thing. also pope also approve this thats why.
@norman readdis  Christianity by and large isn t exactly tolerating these people. the orthodox church  catholic church and oriental orthodox church still consider such things as sin. of course we need to differentiate between the church itself and the members  the churches Imentioned do not tolerate these things but members of course may vary. consider as well that islam still by and large consider females to have almost no rights.
@milliardo5 pope francis already approve of this tho. its a great ideal quite honestly that tolerance is the main mentality of Christianity but it is exploited by people with agenda. being religious is not the only base on your morality  it needs common sense as well. because if not youre really not practicing what you preach.Im a former catholic and acolyte. Im not bounded by any religion whatsoever now but I do practice humility  humanity and common sense. thats the very important way of living as a person whatever your allegiances are from. never think ill will on other people and dont shove crap to people s throats.
@norman readdis  former catholic myself  now orthodox deacon. imo I dont think francis will approve of this. it will greatly splinter the catholic church if he ever pushes forward with this. also I haven t heard of anything that he ever wanted this.
in the uk at least  if you tell a non-binary person something that offends them  you go to jail without trial.
feeling guilt when you sin is a sign you are saved. lost people dont even acknowledge thatsin exists. they see it as just some religious term.
@johnny storm  do you not feel bad when you sin
youre not different from a criminal who send himself to God to protect them in the morning before committing their crimes. after a day of crime rampage  they come back home  pray to God asking for forgiveness  then they go to bed and can sleep safe and sound because their sins already being  forgiven . next day same cycle repeats. disgusting.
@lightwire to many yes you do.but even as a Christian I am tired of people being told that.its just hard to really think that helps at all.
@omar kaj we repeatedly sin often the same one though I know from experience of addiction.
@ultimazalo people who dont even believe in God still feel guilty when they do wrong  though.unless you just mean its a Christian thing only.
@p1k4chu thats some extreme comparison there. a criminal who does the same thing and just feels guilty isnt the same as a Christian feeling guilty about whatever sin.at least in terms of impact and lets be honest we all do things that are considered sin in biblical terms usually repeatedly. whether you looked at a person sexually or not or masturbated or lied or got unreasonably angry. or gossip or are committing hypocrisy.its still different from committing an illegal crime repeatedly though. albeitsimilar in a lesson type of way.
@p1k4chu  when should someone pray for forgiveness
@chandler burse  they dont feel guilty before God. there is a difference. people who are saved experience a spiritual guilt when they do wrong because they do believe in God. the lost cannot experience this. people who are saved have the holy spirit who convicts them of righteousness.
@melonie mac go boom  how do I search for your server  the only thing thats working is I have to click on this provided link above and create a new file. how can I search for your server with my already discord profile  if this makes sense.
blows raspberry
@melonie mac go boom   wait wait  miss melonie.the uk is anglican   not catholic .. so when you use the term  priest   is that even legit   pastor if you want  but definitely not old-school authentic church priest.
the uk is anglican   people.dont confuse that with authentic priesthood.
@goofy grandlouis  the scriptures say that all born again believers are saints and of a royal priesthood.  why would you consider the priests of the roman catholic religion to be authentic vs what the scriptures state
@ian huey   because a priest has to come from an unbroken chain  straight up to the apostles.and henry the 8th was definitely not an apostle ! he was a mortal sinner who beheaded ann boleyn.
@jack rorschach  what I did when I connected to her discord is I clicked on the link and then I signed into my account where I was able to join the server.
@chaochromemessor  that means you are called to the prison ministry then.
how many modernist bishops have you met
@norman readdis  I dont think this guy is catholic  Imean by recorded membership  of course  he is nothing like catholic in belief . I think he is anglican.
groomers gotta groom
because there are those who are distorting the word of God  for personal gain  and itsounds good to those who want  religion  without having to change their sinful nature. they can live in sin  without guilt  and feel good about themselves.
sadly  this is typical in church of england. there s a reason why its gradually dwindling here in the uk while other churches such as evangelical  baptist  etc. are growing.
@langton industries  like I said  the catholic church could splinter if these teachings are introduced. in the case of abortion though I dont think this will happen. abortion has been a big sin since the first century--the didache even names itso. the three ancient churches---the orthodox church  catholic church and oriental orthodox church still hold abortion as a very grave sin. I would think lgbtqa  clergy would have more traction for many catholics than abortion would  but thats just barely so. thankfully as far as we orthodox are concerned lgbtqa  clergy will never be a reality...
@norman readdis  and the church set a flame with whomever supported this offense...
@macah dahma  any people in that religion thatsupported this never red their scriptures or a hypocrite.
yea you right  he about as non binary as melonie has a stalker
all are lI urs
why are you the fun police man  lol.
God  against all the evils that hell can conjure  all the wickedness that mankind can produce  I shall send unto them only you. rip and tear until it is done.
@going blargh  nice doom quote dude
actually they have already been chosen they are in no particular order war  pestilence  famine  and death.
God  let s go with frogs again  for the memes.
starts whispering  thus saith the Lord  thus saith the Lord  thus saith the Lord-

and give up upon using a rainbow as a covenant  for whoever manages to survive will twist its meaning anew for their agendas.  -- a worried cherub  probably
@michael coulter God tried this before he might as well just destroy it and not do it again.
@chandler burse  well once people the people and the earth are destroyed a a new earth and a new heaven will appear itsays so in the book of revelations a book that I dont read then itsays God will repopulate the earth and let loose satan one more time before the final battle
@michael coulter  its revelation not revelations a common misconception
@michael coulter  I dont know I havent read revelation in awhile at least about the satan one more time.at this point in my life I am having an existential crisis. a crisis of faith  a crisis of what comes after death based on evidence not just belief.and I have videos recommended to me about how the Bible is incorrect contradictory and even immoral arguably to videos about how Christianity is pure loving and helps.I attend church but I have less involvement. I still somewhat like it but I use to do more.my pastor in a way betrayed it but we all sin I guess.I suffer from porn addiction and questioned my morals heavily recently questions my lack of drive for life to go to college or find a job.I am not lazy but unwilling to interact with people much anymore.so I dont know anymore.just felt like unloading sorry.
heinz got 57 varieties
this is a compliment - nice play on words
bahahaha I didn t even notice that lol!
he almost looks like jim sterling..... after he turned into stephenie.
thank you so much
ahh thank you  rator
I am a Christian  but consider myself non-denominational  more of a faith and spirituality thing than the religious inc thing. just know that we each have very different relationships and experiences that challenge our faith  the times we fall and find ourselves struggling is not abnormal. take some time and pray. I spent many years after accepting Christ in a dark place and when I finally came out of it  thanks to a friend and roommate who gave me no slack  I came back. its normal for us to struggle  but dont lose sight of him  give him a call  he s always listening.
thank you so much  I will keep you in my prayers. bless you
@melonie mac go boom  I appreciate the reply! my apologies on the broken grammar.  voice to text isnt my friend. anyway thanks again. God bless.
thank you so much!
you got this! thank you so much for sharing
ah thank you so much
I had a very rough time in my life in my walk with God  but what I learned is that he is never distant  we feel distant from him. take some time and tune out the noise  go for a hime or go camping  in the wilderness away from the noise and distractions is when you will feel how close he is.
mel   its awesome to see a strong believer   like yourself on here . the whole reason I stay subscribed is because you love Jesus as much as I do . people filled with the spirit are hard to come by in today s society.
I love your content  but these types of videos are my absolute favorite.  this was so eloquently spoken.  you even encouraged me to do better  and I teach this stuff in the same way to anyone that will listen to me in my daily walk.  excellent job.
greatly appreciate the video  melonie.youre not alone  and this was clearly laid on your heart for a reason. we all struggle in faith and life choices. its natural and comes with being a child of God. being a Christian does not mean we are perfect. and I suspect this video is God s way of getting that message out to those that need to hear it. continue to speak what God puts onto your heart. never again allow discouragement from others dictate your faith and practices. if you feel it needs to be said  then say it. satan wants to silence us and God s word. keep the faith and not allow him.
I would like to thank you for bringing God s word to the people.  as of right now  you ve reached 5.6k people with the gospel here.  some of us may be lucky to reach only one.  keep up the amazing work sister.
from one Christian to the another  God bless you for this video. this is probably the longest video Ive ever seen you put out. haha! I do agree loving others especially friends that you have that are not like you but you also have to realize that the ecosystem you choose to put yourself into is going to affect you and God knows that. you can pray for them and love them but it doesnt mean you have to associate yourself with what they re doing. we are to separate ourselves from stuff like that.
so glad you made this video . people need to hear that there not alone in this crazy world . love from the uk
proud of your boldness and clarity in this. God s word does not return void. praying for those who see this.
melonie  I its always so encouraging to see videos from you like this.  this  non-binary priest  is another example of how so many churches  Christians  are taking the Bible out of context or leaving out the parts they dont like in order to justify willfully living in sin.  be encouraged in the fact that you followed through with what the Lord laid on your heart to do.
thank you for opening up and sharing some of the challenges you have faced. never easy to do  but it helps.
its amazing to see you be so open about your faith. praise God
Im glad you put this out  love the content  itspoke to me and many others Im sure  the fact that its biblical on todays episode is well needed  thank you
I absolutely loved this. it really says a lot how connected this is to all the crazy stuff we re dealing with right now  and of course I always admire how you often share your faith in your videos  so dedicating one which really touches on that more than most is a definite plus. keep up the faith and all the amazing work.     3
I am glad you chose this topic  but still to the velma one also lol . you and I seem to be spot on with our beliefs in our faith. I always love these videos you produce. we re all sinners. none of us are perfect. as a Christian  there is no excuse condoning this sexual perversion that has been going on for a very long time.
God help us. she needs to be a priest as much as I need to be the head of nasa. I know as much about a telescope   a space shuttle as she does about Christianity. we are doomed as a society. I am a Christian myself   melonie Im going to just come out and say this Ive learned about Christianity   the Bible in general because of you. thank you for that.
excellent vod  mel! this vod was very important to make and was very much needed! Im super proud of you for making this! agreed with everything you said! keep respecting your faith and religion and calling out sin! I have stuck with you through every cancel culture attempt and I will continue to do so! friends to the end and beyond!
I live in the uk and I apologize for this madness.
this is a fascinating video  your faith is inspiring even if I cant quite make the leap myself  even though many aspects of my life are an awful mess  illustrated by the fact that I listened to this while doing client billing at 10pm on a friday night and feeling utterly run down and ill from eating terribly.
I learned a lot from this video  melonie. I didn t realize just how serious sexual sin was until I watched this video even though I struggle with it as a man often with just how much of it is in our media. well  I just want to say that I repented and am once again walking with the Lord. keep up the good Christian work  melonie  and continue to be an inspiration.
I want to take the time to say happy saturday to one of the most outstanding outlandish and astonishing charismatic woman the planet. you deserve to be celebrated   admired as many times as possible throughout the year because of a the remarkable gift you continuously are. you make the world a better place with your glamor  your heart for God  the beautiful heart that you possess  and overall because you are just you precious and rare. Im so blessed to follow you and since my birthday is friday it would be a dream control to meet and greet you an aspiration in my life.
just the other day I was thinking about how Im a gamer and a Christian man as well and how refreshing it would be to come across another person on social media that is too and bam! your videos started showing up. which Ive really been enjoying!  Ive been a follower of your page through facebook gaming for quite some time but I consume most of my media here on youtube. seeing how our father orders steps and raises people up to speak in boldness for such a time as this to spread the gospel and speak out against evils of this world is amazing!  makes me proud to see you be obedient to what gets laid on your heart.  we do get mocked or ridiculed for our belief in Jesus but we take it in joy and remember what roman 8 18-23 says. thats just one reminder that motivates me to keep running for Jesus! much love and keep up the great work!
thank you so much! really felt it heavy on my heart to make it  and it turned out a lot longer than my usual videos haha!
@melonie mac go boom  we need someone like you to make these videos!
you shouldn t have to.    its a church originally founded by the royals to facilitate annulment.   its had its ups and downs  no pun intended.   but its been the pawn of the royals government.pretty much how many established dogmas do for political reasons.   I wont call out particular denominations but Ive been a member of two.  one before and another after the age of accountability.
what the hell is going on over there
just be thankful you aren t canada.
@jean bethencourt  I know a man who was professor of sanskrit at oxford  and a great specialist in buddhism. as a major scholar in a major religion  he was often asked to take part in commissions and debates to do with religion at large. he told me that he was once in a room with maybe a dozen anglican bishops  and he realized with a start that not a single one of them spoke as if they had any real belief in the historicity of Jesus. when they were alone with each other  and with this distinguished non-Christian outsider  they treated the Christian religion as a set of historically groundless opinions. and this was decades ago. this is what the hell  literally  is going on over there.
you shouldn t apologize! its happening all over the place  in the united states  also! we have drag queen story time  for children! Ive been praying for my country  but Im gonna add the uk to my prayers  also!
@jean bethencourt dont they ask that about the us too
@chandler burse  Im sure they do but they are not a nation of immigrants and we dont have an official  national church with trans priests.
@jean bethencourt  I couldve sworn uk citizens have said immigration is quite common there too now.
well if you ever feel that nudge to make that leap  my discord server is there in the description and I have an amazing prayer community there who are always at the ready to be there for anyone
what do you mean by  cant quite make the leap  if you dont mind me asking
@ultimazalo  broadly speaking  while I recognize the virtues of faith  I dont  to borrow the language of faith  feel a calling in my heart towards it. and  frankly  I find it unattractive to say no to a lot of things I know are kind of bad for me.
@Lord nelson  if there is anything everyone should know about Jesus it is that he did not die to make bad people good. he died to make dead people live. simple faith in that he died for your sins  was buried and rose again for your justification is all it takes to be saved today. being a Christian is not about working to perfection or beating ourselves up for not being sinless. being a Christian is resting in the finished work of the cross  which produces a faithful and Godly life. hope this helps.
@Lord nelson this comment sounds odd itsounds as if you do believe but just dont want to make a commitment or are you just complexly saying you feel the need to believe but you are an agnostic or something
@chandler burse  it is. but its not originally a colony for immigrants. its the native land of the english.
thank you for sharing all that! its good to find someone thatsheds light on these issues  and as a fellow Christian I can only say - God bless you and give you the strength and willpower to continue being light on a hill!
its so sad to see the church bend down to this madness
Ive been single for 7 years since my wife passed away  and it was her death and her family that led me to Jesus because I was lost.Im 36 now  I believe its possible I have the gift of singleness as paul says it in the nlt.I want a relationship  but at the same time I think do I really though shrugsgreat video  nicely said and explained.
you do right by me  I do right by you. earn respect  help others  etc. how I was raised  but moment you screw up or threaten my family  loved ones  friends and so on  the gloves come off. I am still trying to find my way reconnect with the Lord  and at the same time  regardless of what you are  if you are different  and want to learn about Jesus  then go to church  or come to my church. Im just tired of the wokeness  I really am. Im just glad my church is not woke  but still accepts all with open arms.
at first I couldn t help but be intrigued by the non-binary preacher. but this was incredible. very inspirational and exactly what a lot of us need to hear. thank you for this.
your Christian content bangs  melonie. its very clear that youre so passionate about what youre speaking on  which makes you such a compelling speaker. who cares if it doesnt get as many views  like you said  its not always about that  but about who it cantouch - and you certainly touched me  you also compelled me to go to church tomorrow  when I was planning against it  so thats something!  !
melonie  as someone who isn t Christian  a believer of any God nor a follower of any religion  because of hardships in my life which plagued me with darkness and suffering in the past  as I grew the courage to seek psychiatric help I also desperately searched for some kind of spiritual help that could guide my heart and mind to better places  I was able to find guidance through buddhist and kabbalah teachings but I lost connection to them through recent hardships. listening to you talk about your faith has made me reconnect with those things that in part saved my life  even if its not entirely the same as your Christian faith  I want to thank you for opening my heart to them again during turbulent times. found your channel out of luck by watching different  modern gaming is dead  kind of videos but I was shocked to see I ended up watching this one in full interest and ending up illuminated in some way  you have a gift inside of you  thank you!
thank you for standing up for Jesus Christ on this matter. Ive watched your channel for a little bit   like that you dont hide the fact that you follow Jesus. Im also a Christian who hasn t  been in church or reading the holy Bible like I should. these are dark times we are living in stay strong  Im praying for you and this crazy world.
your strength and boldness in your faith was moving to say the least.
really good insightful video  that I needed right now.. I fell off with my faith  and culminating into doing something Im not proud of doing. its definitely a struggle to not live in your flesh    dedicate your life to Jesus. living in sin hard to get out of  but I feel miserable and I think youre right and this is a message I needed to hear. came across your videos randomly  and I think God uses people like you for others to hear a message they need to hear  so its not a coincidence I came across this video.
thank you for your video melonie! I have been having a crisis of faith recently related to the relativism creeping into the church  especially after the shutdown from covid. this video is great.I love and fear God  I worry about his church. I will continue to pray for wisdom and strength  as well as add you to my prayers.
melonie mac  great video and appreciate you being bold in sharing your faith and personal testimony. I am a pastor  and I couldn t have done a better job in sharing the gospel of Christ like you did in this video. keep up the excellent work!
thank you so much for preaching  melonie. I recently stumbled upon your channel from a drunk3po jay shoutout  and am so glad I did. your words give me courage as I struggle in my own walk. may God bless you and keep you.
I like your fearless content  melonie. we cannot let Jesus be dragged through the muck like this. I dont hate these people. I hate sin. including my own.
God bless you   mel. youre doing good things.
melonie  melonie  melonie ! perfectly put! you are a true warrior for Christ. this is what everyone needs to hear and this is what I needed to hear. a lot of the things you said and the scripture you quoted hit hard. pierced my soul to the core. I look back at my life and I committed a lot of sexual immorality in my life with my first gf that I eventually married and I justified it with well we re engaged so its ok. its not ok. its sin plain and simple. sadly our marriage fell apart after 6 years of marriage and I had no choice in the matter. I thought Imarried someone that claimed to be a person saved by the blood of Jesus but as I see her today I can clearly see she is not. I cantotally understand what you went through in your life and the rebellion too and how painful it is that you and I both made bad decisions because we wanted to put Christ on the back burner. I too have been saved since I was young but in my 20 s made bad decisions and my life now as Im 40 has suffered for it and I dont blame anyone but myself. I knew the truth and know God s word but I chose to sin and it was stupid. it eats at your soul and mind and if people think thatsin cant do that to you is wrong because it destroys you sometimes not immediately but slowly. but God! he has been changing my life he has been bringing me back to him. when I do sin I absolutely hate it I feel ashamed and guilt immediately. I want to be a better man for Christ and I too want to serve him more however I canto bring him honor and glory. I too am single like a lot haha and pray that if its his will to bring a Christian woman in my life to work and serve and glorify him together would be amazing... plus if she s a gamer nerd  too would be a place haha. you are doing exactly what God wants and speaking truth without worrying about what the world has to say or how persecuted you ll be know that Im here praying for you and feeling that persecution with you. dont ever stop speaking truth in love and for standing for truth. I love your platform I love your channel and love you as a sister in Christ. its a privilege to get to here you speak and be vulnerable and courageous in your life. would love to speak with you and definitely will be praying for you more to keep shining the light in a world so incredibly dark and if I never get to meet you in this life well definitely see each other in the next. marantha Lord Jesus  come quickly
God bless you  melanie! I am so thankful for you and your channel!
thank you  melonie  for your bravery in this matter.  this specific lifestyle is such a lifestyle that  unfortunately  more and more people are accepting each and every day.  therefore we as Christians need to speak the scriptural truth to all people  in love and graciousness  yes  but also with great firmness so that they may understand that their lifestyle is against what God s will is for us in our lives.  may he bless you each and every day  and may he continue to strengthen and keep you as you stand firm in the faith he has given you.
what a great video  thanks for making it.  this is a very important subject  and reminds me of a of stuff I read about in the screwtape letters a few years ago.  I remember going through financial peace university and hearing the phrase  buyer beware   which I translated into how satan basically uses marketing tactics if you think about it  making us yearn for what s convenient as opposed to what s actually beneficial.  the course was mainly relating the finance but I sort of expanded that idea in my head  and I even renamed the  seven deadly sins  into the  seven deadly comforts  to put that idea that what feels  convenient  or  easy  isn t really what God wants us to accept.  it would be very easy to simply stop fighting the ways of the flesh and just give in  or to go back to exercise and fitness it would be better not to work harder and stay active but you wouldn t really get anywhere  I think I need to heed that myself literally in terms of fitness  I admit I need to exercise more than I do  definitely .  if we just  accept  and offer nothing to challenge their perception then they ll never grow  and this definitely applies to ourselves as well and what God wants to do through us.  thats definitely why reading the Bible daily is important  thats our spiritual exercise for sure.I think I wrote a bit too much  its a bad habit of mine  sorry about that.  thank you for this video  Im glad you made it!!!
thanks for sharing your thoughts   can definitely relate to struggles with faith in past but its best to look at it as long term investment in the soul as you grow  its always great to see our fellow Christians stand strong on their faith  very inspiring   would look forward in hearing more
guessing church of england  not real Christians
@jonathan devereaux  there are real Christians that attend  and my heart goes out to them
definitely shows the separation between the biblical church and the worlds idea of  church
the church of england was founded on sin so this is not surprising.
@rooster illusion is this the church henry the 8th made
Im only at the beginning of my journey through faith and man. this is wild. I dont understand where certain people come from with this
Jesus spoke the truth in the face of certain death and  he carried his cross for us   the least we can do is to  do the same for him !melonie  you have become one of my favorite creators on youtube. may God bless you and keep you safe in these crazy times! your courage  much like your smile  is contagious. you will lead many to truth  and therefore  salvation. for our father is  the way  the truth  and the life ! well done  and keep up the great work!
thank you for sharing. your personal story with your past relationship helped me evaluate what Im going through atm and I ll be able to make decisions a little better going forward. God bless you honestly.
great vid melonie. outside my church  often times even in my family  I get told how foolish it is to refuse to date someone who doesnt have God in her heart  but I have before and it was never a relationship that did any favors for me. enjoyed listening and watching.
hey I just want to thank you for inspiring me to get back in the faith that I have been away from for a little bit  I appreciate you so much. and as somebody who is around the same ages you youre not alone in the fact that you dont want to get in a relationship with somebody that is not of the same faith as you are Im in the same boat. so once again thank you I appreciate you more than you will ever know
I love when you make these kinds of videos youre an excellent representative of your faith.
Im glad someone is talking about this stuff.  and this stuff is crap. not of God. hey melonie. you look good. I like the shirt
I love the courage you have for God and Jesus I admire that thats awesome
thank you for posting this. I became disillusioned with my church of 50 years became  woke  about 5 years ago. preaching transgender acceptance and even promoting abortion. I walked away from the church  not Christ  and was struggling with my spirituality. finally found a church rooted in scripture. that and posts like this have helped put me back on the path.
great video melonie! love the more lengthier videos like this. as a fellow Christian its awesome to see you staying to true to your morals and beliefs  even if it means losing friends. also I really enjoy seeing your take on these things. I agree 100  wokeness comes from satan. almost everything they believe and do contradicts God s word  and is nothing but evil. keep up the awesome content!  its very refreshing to see someone  especially close in age  being a strong Christian! helps and inspires me to grow in my own faith and being a better person in general. youre doing great!
melanie you are awesome! I love you and your content. your faith and stance to stand by it is inspiring. secondly but certainly not least you have a dog and I love dogs! great content we as Christians need to stand against and call out the unrighteousness of this world and stand with God. one thing I do is call out shame on people as I work as nighttime security and see it quite often.
great message melonie! its not just the world thatsatan is deceiving without hiding but now the body of Christ. people like you boldly standing up to his lies are rallying others to make a stand. it can put us at odds with people we care about but if nobody speaks up then we cant blame the condition of the world on anyone than ourselves.thanks for being brave.
melonie  this is one of the most beautiful videos I have ever seen. bless you
this video is an example of why I support  I am happy with the fruits of my labor and sweat on display here  I am aware many others support too and mel made the video . I feel fulfilled
amen and well said melonie.  I pray God continues to use you for his will in Jesus name.
thank you! there s a lot more I could say  or explain why Im thankful  but to keep itsimple  I ll leave it there. this has inspired me  this has reassured me  so thank you. God bless!
hearing you with your own personality talk about the word of God and how it apllies in this world is spectacular and interesting. Im learning a bit about the the ways God want us to live because that is how we can make the world a bit better and to be more of a defender of a righteous and honest life   have a nice day everyone!
much more respect for you after this video. thank you
one thing that this  priest  has not learned is that you cant please God and the world it has to be one or the other
not really the story I was expecting to hear but definitely what I needed to hear. I appreciate the message and the honesty it reminds me when you call this out something from peter 4 17  judgement begins in the house of God
proud of you!
I know the feeling. I have dated a 2 14 2 14  couple people in the past who were not Christians. however  God has used those relationships to teach me. so he canteach you as wellthrough your bad times and your good times. remember  the Lord is always with you the Bible says that he will never leave us  nor for sake us.
well I am a single virgin for life so I lucked out there haha.actually considering my issues of sexual types I probably am not lucky there.cant change anything though.
thank you
@melonie mac go boom  I know this probably sounds weird. but there are times when you get personal about your past. I just wish I could give you a hug and tell you its going to be ok. and God loves you and he has wonderful plan for you  melonie. love you  your a good friend. take care.
Im sorry you had to walk away from your church of 50 years  andrew.... praise God you found one that you can now root yourself in
this!!!
@melonie mac go boom   thanks melonie
one cannot serve two masters.
if itsmells of sulphur thatstrongly...
these types of videos may not be your most viewed but they are definitely appreciated. I admire your conviction coming from a lapsed catholic. stay strong  deus vult omnes homines salvos fieri.
awesome coverage! keep bringing the truth to the people  and the light to the darkness!
this is the Bible study I didn t know I needed. thank you.
thank you for pushing on   making this video. God bless!
the wages of sin is death  straight up  doesnt matter what the sin was  without repentance and forgiveness
faith plus logic   the true word.  I appreciate your words and the bravery and integrity one must have to express the truth.
I remember a church speaker once said something I d never heard in the church before but it was so absolutely on point. he said  sin feels good  and it does  which is why its so appealing to do wrong  but just because it feels good doesnt make it right  its still wrong
preach girl it makes me so happy and joyful that I found your channel so glad you will be my sister in Christ forever keep on fighting the good fight expose all of this blasphemy
after watching this video I realize I have been like a tea bag steeping in a boiling cup of sin. at this point sin is so much a part of my life that its almost like a comfort blanket.
you video is greatly appreciated and resounds with me.  at the end of the day  we all must make the conscious effort to surrender our lives to Jesus every day.  we are all flawed humans who must not give ourselves over to sin  and yet we sin  all the same.  but with Jesus  we can have the boldness to call it out and condemn it.
great job using your platform to talk about Jesus!
Im not religious but I can understand your general premise and respect you for it. I agree that there needs to be a certain line in the sand that humanity collectively decides not to cross. itseems like there s mass confusion about everything these days  especially for young people in gen z. some of them have little to no sense of identity or purpose so they re grasping at these certain labels hoping that it will give them thatsense of self esteem  identity and stability that they crave. its actually pretty sad to watch and I hope things improve. my two cents anyway
thank you for all you do I think it beautiful the way you speak the word.
I cant believe this channel has been up for almost a year now. time sure does fly.on another note  I cant believe Ive managed to watch all the videos on it too.
thank you  melonie. I needed to hear this
clear as mud to the eye for the blind to see.we are not called to saved  we are called to follow God  Christ.be good  stay safe  and keep booming this stuff
great testimony!  thanks for sharing
thank you for standing up for your faith!  everything you said is truth. the world hates that. God loves the sinner and hates the sin.
their is no greater joy than to be pleasing in the eyes of God. stay obedient sister!!
preach it  girl!
sometimes when a sin is severe for me it feels like it isnt redeemable its an excuse to claim you are fine when you are not.likepedophilia and sexual offenses.even though I am not those things I have a lot of ocd and anxiety and a porn addiction that has made me believe to be no different than that even though I never sought out such things just degenerative porn anyways.still if it was me I just feel its an excuse too much to think I have any redemption.punishment on earth gained or not.
your videos are full of truth. keep doing great things and loving God
good for you using your influence to spread the word of God. you are as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside
stick around to the end  she explains herself well then.  its a beautiful thing
never ever have I clicked the  share  button as quickly as I have after watching the full video.thanks melonie mac! go boom!!
as a Christian myself  I want to encourage you  to continue your growth in the faith  I will pray for you
thank you  for speaking Gods word you are awesome and God bless you
this video was awesome! I just discovered you on twitter  and found this link. thankyou for your courage! if you live in dallas  you should try robert morris s church! I love to listen to him. anyway  thankyou so much!
melonie  as a Christian father of 2 daughters  you give me hope
haven t even started the video but based on that thumbnail I know its going to be good.
your courage encourages me!
for me this is especially hard. know you are right about a lot of this. but im a bisexual guy living in a gay relationship.. I dont really know which way to go about it. I love my boyfriend and always think  how can such a pure 19yo guy be a sin for me. I love him really and know that our love is real. but on the other hand  I know Gods words and I cant help myself but feeling bad and guilty. I see no reason in breaking up with him  cause all we have is good  I love him  and on the other hand it will destroy him  because he really loves me too. but am I fooling Christ living like this I do want children at some point and want a family. I also know that im more and more finding God and want him in my life.I always think about it.. is there a way I can live with my boyfriend and still be a good Christian  I comp etely reject the lgbt community and the trans ideology  we both do and I also try to be vocal about that on tiktok  and tr to encourage homo and transsexuals to get out of this satanist institution. I really want conservatism to rise again.I also believe it is possible to be a homosexual and conservative  as long as I accept the Lord in my life  and the nature of things in my mind. .. idk..
great video melonie and stay strong
thank you so much for sharing I have been struggling and starting to change what I eat and etc. its hard and I fall often but im always  trying to be better.
just became one of my favorite channels. keep fighting the good fight !!!!
I just find itstupid calling yourself religious when your going against the Bible  like this guy is doing
preacher friend had a video a few weeks ago about a drag preacher in a methodist church  he shared part of the message and could feel the confusion trying to sneak in and could only watch so much of it! guard your gates  test the spirits  know the word!
I wanted to watch this one in one sitting and finally had time. much to ponder and Im shamelessly stealing your healthy body spirit analogy. count  1 helped
God bless you girl for speaking about this evil.
as someone who grew up Christian  it has always been a difficult road  one paved with people within the church condemning me for my family history  or for being a youth pastor  without submitting to a congregation. then leaving my  false Christian  fiance at 27 for cheating on me and then her demanding me to leave my station as a pastor to focus on her career. losing friends for not chasing their sinful lifestyle. it could have broken me  but in the end  through God s grace and through faith in Christ  I remain in him. 26yrs strong  saved at the age of 3  holy spirit filled at the age of 10. keep on fighting the good fight melonie and God bless! for a righteous man falls seven times  and rises again  but the wicked stumble in time of disaster and collapse  - proverbs 24 16
stay strong sis!
I was never good at having patience nor tolerance  thank the Lord our God for changing me for the better but this    really  really infuriates me  but I just tell myself  leave it in God s hands  his justice will come sooner or later .
as someone who lives in the uk  I am so glad that you covered this. read about itsomewhere and Im kinda not surprised thatsomething like this has now happened  and at the same time in disbelief  at best  that it happened.calling itsacrilege is putting it lightly - it is an absolute disregard for the truth and also for the authority of God s word. and actually  just a day or so after you posted this video  I heard a sermon on the letter of jude and alot of the stuff in thatsermon very much addresses this whole thing. you can read jude for yourself rather than take my word for it. keep contending for the truth  melonie!
awesome video  melonie!!  be bold in your faith!  matt. 10 33.  I used to know someone who claimed to be believer  but her lifestyle was anything but biblical!!  she refused to give up her promiscuity.  I asked her if she ever approached the Lord in prayer  and surrender her lust to him.  she looked at me as though I was crazy  stating   no  Im afraid he ll change me!!   I quickly reminded her that if she placed her faith in him  and surrendered her lust   promiscuity to him  he would replace that lust with something far more fulfilling in his own time.  she didn t believe me.  when I knew her  she had been battling an aggressive form of lung cancer for the last 3yrs.  but she was struggling with quitting cigarettes.  I asked her about surrending that too  and asking God to help her  but she also refused to do so.  and the same with weed as well!   she refused.  then I found out thatshe was selling her vicodin prescription on the street!!.  I confronted her about that too  and she erupted on me.   she was proud to be a  solo Christian  who attended a mega church.  when I asked her why a mega church   her answer   so I can slip in and slip out unnoticed.  I dont want to deal with other Christians!!   she also erupted on me when I encouraged her to join a small group Bible study to really grow in her walk with the Lord.  knowing that being a part of a small group would place her under closer accountability to other believers.  whom she did not want to deal with at all!!   she didn t want to share her testimony with other believers b c she felt rejected every time she did share.  I kept encouraging her to keep sharing with other believers.  I knew that if genuine believers had heard her testimony  they would not only accept her  but also encourage her  and offer their help to assist in her growth in the Lord whether through prayer support  or offering to meet with her regularly  and teach   share with her how the Lord has worked in their lives.  it was heartbreaking to see how upset she became with me for gently suggesting some things that God has used in my life to help me grow in my walk with him more closely  a biblically driven church lead by pastors who take the Bible seriously  being involved in a small group Bible study  memorizing verses  recieving one on one discipleship training with a believer with more experience  fellowship with other believers  using your talents   abilities to serve others in any capacity whether in outreach  missions  or serving other ppl at your church.  its just heartbreaking b c she refused to do any of those things!!  everyone has something to contribute.  you dont even have to be talented to serve  God calls us to glorify him by showing his love for one another in earnest.  he created all of us.  he knows us each better than we know ourselves.  and we cannot hide anything from him!!  he knows every thought we will ever have throughout our entire lives!  believe me  I tried to point her to God   biblical truths for the short time I knew her  but she just refused to repent for anything  b c she saw nothing wrong with her lifestyle.  just itsays in romans 1 28-32.  she was given over to a depraved mind before I ever met her.   even though we dont speak any longer  I still pray for her to repent  and ultimately her salvation.  she also believes in works based salvation  seeking signs   wonders  modern day prophets   prophecy  faith healing  name it   claim it  7 mountain madate  and word of faith God cant do anything unless you give him permission first  and as believers  we are  little Gods   honestly  some pretty serious heresies that are not even the slightest bit biblical.  I would ve stayed in her life to continue to be a witness to her  but she became very manipulative towards me  and the Lord made it clear that I did everything I could.  it was time to exit her life.  its just very sad how the enemy has so many footholds in her life.  and at the time of my sharing this with all of you  she has less than a year to live.  her mind is full strife  anger  paranoia  anxiety  greed  hubris  unrest  and not a shred of peace  empathy  or humility.  as hard as it was to walk away  Ive had to leave her to God now.   dont get me wrong  I dont mean to pass judgement. Im only sharing what Ive witnessed the last 6mos.  Ive known Im a terrible  wicked sinner myself  but Im not afraid to approach the Lord to confess   repent multiple times a day  everyday.  its part of walking with God daily  and turning from my own wickedness.  Im guilty  and Im helpless without God s grace  and help.  I never forgot that I deserve death  and I owe God everything!  how blessed is our God   king that he is not only eager to forgive  but also eager to help us in our sanctification daily!  never forget  we are in a spiritual war.  there is no compromise with the world  or the enemy.  there are many ways to show God s love to the lost.  be innocent as doves  but shrewd as vipers.  matt. 10 16.  if anyone is interested  these are some very biblical yt channels  fighting for the faith  the messed up church  longfortruth1  treasureChrist  good fight ministries    bezelt3
well said  sister!just subscribed.
keep charging sister! sounds like the convos Im having with  Christian  friends. bless you
I love it when you add the faith in your shows. personally it helps. ready for you to rip on velma now
its blasphemy and more people need to call it what it is.
I chose celibacy over 7 years ago after a 6 year relationship. not necessarily because of my faith but because I was tired of dating and starting over too many times. since  Ive found inner peace and learned to love myself and others in new ways. Ive been a sinner all my life  you can call me a non practicing confused Christian. I do believe in God  and strongly believe in free will. all humans are granted free will to choose to live in love and peace or in hate and fear. I choose to live in love and peace and try to accept  even if sometimes its very hard  everyone around me even if they re sinful because in the end  only our maker shall judge us. its important to know sin  call it out but I also believe forgiveness is the most powerful thing someone can do to the sinful. its how I found my peace.
thank you for being obedient and sharing.
true bravery is rare on youtube
the fact that the church congregation is accepting and allowing  non-binary  pastors  drag queens and any anything else regarding the alphabet people  is why Im looking for the best way for me to start my journey  my walk with God.
much love and hugs melonie for the vid  God bless you!!
God loves all genders!both of them.
I haven t been a practicing catholic for a few decades  and have questioned more than a few doctrines beliefs I was taught in the years since.  that is my journey  trying to understand my faith and my personality.  how they mix  how I can incorporate both to become a better person.but her  perspective represents nothing of what I was taught and tried to find as a balance of life since.  its pushing  the message .  its fine if thats about entertainment and or social issues  they can preach to the choir and the rest of us can easily truthfully hilariously tear their narrative apart.  putting that ideology in religion will not end well  regardless what faith you are.
inspiring. thank you.
amen sister!!
Christianity shouldn t have exceptions or let sin be okay or be adjusted to the world s standards. Christianity is divine. it is living for Christ. not for the world. like you said  we cant serve 2 masters. its either Jesus or the world. I personally choose Jesus. and Im glad that you are brave to stand up for your faith. I know that God is happy seeing you serve him. God bless you melonie  and keep your faith in Christ.
melonie  you are speaking for me. everything you discussed here was right on point. sincerely  thank you for speaking up.
these thing s make the patients of arkham asylum look sane.
melonie...you are an amazing individual
this just kind of sounds like you only hope for these people to be damned to hell.thats problematic not a Christian thing to want.
yeah I should ve worded that better  more like Im not just going to get mad and say oh bad people burn  no just leave it in God s hands he ll deal with them whether God will make them see the error of their ways and have them repent from their sins and learn from their mistakes and grow stronger with him . again sorry for  the miscommunication or wording I hope you see what Imean
I guess I am arguably incelibracy of sorts.just dont care about it as much as the internet forum dudes do.
based
amen.
ugh I was planning on making pizza this weekend after a solid week of working out! now I feel guilty! but seriously yeah the world is dying away from its own poison and we re quite literally at the point where we have to stay awake because not only will the son of man come like a thief in the night that we must keep at the ready to receive him  the evil one is similarly trying to thieve into our hearts and minds and make all the sickness dooooo much more bearable for us.our free will isn t a gift to do with as we please.our free will is a responsibility entrusted to us to do what is right.
when he entered the building  he was reported to have said we are legion  and we come in many varieties
hello.  I wanted to say thank you.  I actually meant to comment on one of your earlier videos to let you know that I really miss how you use to end each video with a  verse of the day  and ask why you stopped doing that.  it was disappointing not hearing those at the end of each video  but then I just got use to you not doing it and forgot lol.  youreally should go back to that. it was very uplifting and inspiring to see you standing strong in your faith and putting that out there regardless of what anyone else thought.  I really hope you go back to that.  well  thanks again .
I think the Lord guided me to see this  Ive been extremely depressed lately because it feels like I no matter what I do  no matter how nice I tried to be  it feels like I am always getting a lot of hate out of no where or on very small things like disagreement what version of a cartoon show is better  even though I wasn t originally part of that argument and was just agreeing what someone else said but out of the three of the people I was in agreement with for some reason I gotten the most hate for it. now I cant help but to feel like that Bible verse just explained so much
evil thrives when good people stay silent.
for the overseas audience   this morning  is the uks top daytime show. host phillip schofied recently came out as gay even though he is still married and lives with his wife.the show also faced heavy backlash around the time  50 shades  hit cinemas  they invited their merch team to promote sex toys on morning tv.
you get a lot more right than most Imeet. feels like when aquila and priscilla met apollos... just need a few things refined.  acts 18 24-28  not gonna do that in a comments section  though.to add  with the context of the subject of the video  2 timothy 4 3  for there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the wholesome teaching  but according to their own desires  they will surround themselves with teachers to have their ears tickled.
Im a struggling Christian that came out of a church environment that was very fear based and it has been a struggle in certain aspects navigating life afterwards. the way I see it is my upbringing creates solid upstanding citizens but it also creates spiritually lukewarm  people that prioritize the wrong things and that let fear keep them from ever changing habits after you ve changed views on certain beliefs. here s a taste of my church environment.... we had the typical clothing obsession many strict churches have  women dresses men pants etc  no Christmas  pagan holiday  no theaters even though we had a tv at the house  no sports because of the verse about reveling  no tattoos because a verse in the ot about not making any mark or something  never a curse word spoken from anybody no matter the context. I know itseems crazy but when these beliefs are ingrained in you from your youth its hard simply changing overnight.
holy frick  I didnt even know you had this channel and I just randomly stumbled upon it  instant subbed
right on. stay in the word and keep growing in faith. where two or more gather in his name he is there. that is the church imo.
there is nothing more cringe than the term non binary. I implore anyone to try and find something more cringe. I ll wait
im not a religious person but all I can do is apologise for him to the guys and girls who is religious
Im not religious like how I was raised  but I do have spiritual and moral standards still and oh my word .
we shouldn t even be embracing nor celebrate our sins  we need to suppress and overcome our sins. I know there s a saying  it feels so wrong but feels so right  in which would make sense for some instances when it comes to the human body but not all the dang time though! I pray for my temptations   urges to be completely suppress overcome someday alongside believing I have my own self-control  strong will    faith!
I dont remember in genesis saying  God created the non binary due to his love of variety.  Lord give me strength during this times and melanie God bless you ass well.
21 05 is the most based thing I have heard all year. preach
I swear whenever someone is non binary they always just end up looking trans lol
I was baptized as a teen and followed my faith into my late twenties  then in my early thirties I faltered but I am once again following my faith. the one thing I never let go was the leson from mathew 7. matthew 71  do not judge  or you too will be judged. 2 for in the same way you judge others  you will be judged  and with the measure you use  it will be measured to you.
they twist religion into what they want instead of having to face the reality that they re wrong. the worst part is some will be fooled by them.ps still make a velma review video where you do voices ala your blood origin one
and I thought this year couldn t get any weirder.
make that pizza  friend  but dont lose sight of your personal health. one cheat day is not gonna hurt  its making every day a cheat day that hurts. lol.
@anonymous cheese he cheats once he will cheat again.at least he could consider that I say maybe
I addressed this at the end of this video
@melonie mac go boom  lol.  oh sorry.  Im still watching it lol
so true!
reminds me of how my brother in law said his grandma cried when he got his first tattoo because she believed it was unredeemable and eternally damning.I dont believe thats what the Bible says.but if thats the kind of God that did exist its not a loving one I say.
alpha male
male feminist
shakira s new song.
this story reminds me of the woman at jacob s well in season 2 of the chosen. that was a really good episode
well   and dating in adulthood  is a whole heck of a thing isn t it
the Bible literally said this would happen  that false preachers would come in the Lord s name  saying they did good works in his name  flattering people with words and secular philosophy  leading them astray. some will deny it  but this God s word coming true.
you should make this a sunday thing.
thanks for standing up for what you believe. it puts you in a vulnerable place  and that takes guts. but know that no matter how many people stand against you  God and you make the majority. thats what my dad always told me growing up. I dont envy the abuse you ll take for being faithful in public  but know itstrengthens the faith of those that are quite. I think its 2 kings chapter 17  it talks about how God protects us with his angels when we go to battle.  and there are more with us than against us.  thank you! stay strong and know you ll be supported through all the hate that will inevitably come.
I agree 100 percent
I suppose this new way does beat the verse of the day  I think this works just fine melonie
when melonie said   bingo   Im like  yup... then melonie s said   ...allison   Im like  no... you ve got to be joking... please  be joking... youre not joking  are you...
bless you mel.
respect  I didn t know you are a Christian. you are the only one I know in this space. its great
he loves the variety he created. what he created is perfect because he is perfect. anything other than what he created is not.
haha. can I introduce you to my sugar free desserts and keto  carnivore business  as a catholic  bless you and stay well sister.
you should a weekly video related to Christianity. I think it would be nice to see those more often.
this is weird n bizarre  but we must be faithful n do justice n good deeds
I listen in to your videos more then I watch. I have no idea what you were showing us.
thank you for defending the Christian faith and helping me understand it more and btw I thought you were somewhere around 26-30
God loves you and wants a relationship with you   best decision you d ever make  but if you willingly ignore what he says then thats not much of a relationship.
happy friday melonie mac!have a good weekend!
im new to this channel  I thought it was just about video games but I was pleasantly surprised to learn theres alot of Christian content on here as well.
someone posing as you offered me a reward. luckily for me  Im not lucky enough to win awards
amen!
its not like this hasnt already existed to be fair
vulnerable is the word you meant to use   I believe
bless you!
carnivore  doing that right now since the last time I did it for two weeks  it was the best two weeks I ever felt. more energy  more rested  more aware  and more clear minded.
the Bible says when you indulge in sexual sin youre destroying your body.
its nice  if even by accident to have subscribed to an active Christian
great video  well done that woo-man!!
no more pizza and cinnabons  melonie!!!  we know what that leads to for you!
priest cant even get married but f itsure this is the kind of variety the church really needs  whole worlds going nuts.
keep doing you.
Imiss 2016...
fantastic and inspirational vid
I am a Christian  yet I have sinned  and unfortunately  I have let fear control me for years  but recently  God freed me from that fear and regret. although I am still facing temptation and sin  I am continuing to pray to God to give me strength and have faith in him. it is absolutely blasphemous that people are poisoning Christianity with wokeness and progressivism.
good vid  keep up the good work.
on point
that dream kinda reminds me of a scene from the book  this present darkness  by frank peretti
sexual sin is bondage to evil spirits. .God sets rules to set us free
friendship with the world is enmity with God.  rebellion against God happens to many of us even later in life.  as long as we repent and turn back is what matters! keep up the good fight.
love your neighbor that walks in grace.love your neighbor thatstumbles carrying sin even more.for they have greater need of your light  so they may find the way back to grace.
thank you  melonie.
real confidence is only desiring God s approval of yourself  and your life.
can I email you  just want to let you know how my wife and Imet  its a very unique experience that I think wont work for everyone but it came from sin and with our faith in God brought us closer.
thanks for the shout out!
good Lord  I dont even know where to start this world seems like it has turned upside down. cool too btw
of course
I d say beware the devil sings with the voice of an angel  but even its voice is demonic sounding
I go to the woods to spend time with Jesus  not even joking.also  I loved the Bible verse at the end and Imiss it  but I understand why you wouldnt as well
I once heard itsaid that when someone turns to Christ  they should want to turn from sin  and they would be constantly trying to improve. the new progressive Christian ideology doesnt recognize the value of truth and morality  and its probably more destructive to the church and anything else Ive seen or read about. weirdly  they re so tolerant that they re intolerant of anyone that isn t 100  in alignment with their current worldview.
you should have a channel of just Christian and faith talk
bingo allison or bull alistar. sounds like demons invading the church
this is insane
paul said we need to crucify our flesh daily so we can avoid the temptation of sin. I feel this is something we all struggle to do  at least consistently
they just dont stop perverting all things sacred the people who allowed this should be absolutely ashamed
I was told once by a priest  that I highly respect  that the gates of hell are paved by the skulls of priest and ministers that lead their flocks astray
as a casual hindu all this stuff is wild lmao
correct me if Im wrong  but doesnt the Bible address the issue s  of degeneracy pretty clearly often I think this pastor skipped over those passages in order to spare his feelings
things like this make me wish paul kersey  and his friend  wildey  were still around...
this is how a third of the teachers from my college use  the rules . the official rules are not official for them  they come with their own official rules  that dont benefit the student. remember the phrase with  false prophets will speak in my name   or something like that. pretty true  and after that  doom  the end  bye  bye. start over.
me  thinking I have a shot with melonie mac.melonie mac  I only date Christian man.me
thank you for the incredible video! we must cut out the weeds.
what is happening anymore melonie smh   have a great weekend sis God bless
matthew 7 15-20 - read up ya ll!
this was a very insightful video. thank you for sharing. I dont know you. I understand you better now. keep up the good life. and drink some water.
uk person here  this is a church of england vicar  anglican in the us  I think. we call it cofe  which has recently become very  very woke. they ve been kicking people who disagree and want to follow biblical teachings out before they qualify as vicars  you have to do a degree  an ma  and then at least 3 years as a curate  so its pretty evil to do itso pettily  so you ll see more and more of this. not really surprising when the whole church was founded just so a man could change his wife. satisfying the flesh  indeed. I feel so bad for Christians  proper ones  when they have to watch their sacred beliefs get trampled on like this.  Im not religious  but its sad to see one of the sources of my culture falling to eviil.
sees thumbnail oh  this is gonna be interesting. grabs popcorn
funny how so many denominations and beliefs skip  misinterpret etc many key things.
your dog is so adorable!
good video. thank you
not any crazier than belief in a sky wizard
overton window is so far gone that just speaking against this can get you in trouble. if I were the devil  I d subvert the churches first. I d begin with a campaign of whispers. with the wisdom of a serpent  I would whisper to you as I whispered to eve   do as you please  - paul harvey.
bold statement you  @melonie mac go boom  as a single woman  have demonstrated far greater wisdom and discernment than the entire clergy within the church of england . . . . . . . .and I say that as someone who is part of a church family that is part of the church of england.
God bless you

pslams 26 verse 1-12...but verse 1 has the most impact on me.
I was baptised roman catholic but Im personally agnostic. while I still believe the Bible is a great book of moral truths and am envious of those who can hold faith  I am more and more disgusted each day by the church bending to modern ideology rather than standing firm and being the cure.
what in the lauren dagal did I just watch the Bible is in no way unclear  and good for you for speaking up its rare for young Christians to actually understand their own religion nowadays.  good job sister
the word of God never changes. culture changes but the word stays the same yesterday today and forever. God is love but love is not God. love does not delight in evil but rather rejoices in truth . culture today is taking aim at the word of God truth. this is good vs evil manifestation in the physical world but at war in the spirit ephesians 6 12 love God bless
if thats a priest then Im one of the mighty morphin power rangers
Im not Christian but I respect your values and understand your perspective.  from my point of view  modern values lack morality  decency  common sense and a respect for authority.  its tough to respect authority that is completely and openly corrupt which is in my opinion promoting a global society of degenerate slaves.
please  dont tell him  let him find out at the gates. michael will tell him

biggest problem I see today is that people choose what they want to believe in before studying anything. then only one thing can happen  they fit their beliefs into things. anything at all  history  politics  psychology  biology  math  the Bible... so on and so forth. anything becomes  evidence  of that what they choose to believe in previously.
blasphemy  sacrilege  heresy  anathema.there are not words strong enough to express how despicable this truly is.we are all sinners but the point in repentance is that we stop doing the things and that wont happen if we allow ourselves to be comfortable in sin.
it is when she technically be a priestess in video
when I was younger I never thought in 1 million years that when we were going into the end of days that it would be a sex thing  however when I think of our God giving him ways and the natural order of things  it makes total sense !
non binary priest  thats like a good and loving woke person
same!
@melonie mac go boom  lacey sturm flyleaf morImemento album. this album is a masterpiece.
hence why many believers dont want to be called Christians necessarily anymore because of what it all entails via the worlds view.
Im a Christian  but I am non-denominational. I have more of a spiritual and faith thing than whatever religion inc says. organized religion is such a joke to me. I dont need the validation and acceptance of others as long as I am right with God.
@anonymous cheese  disorganized religion can be an even bigger joke. nothing worse than impotence.
deuteronomy 22 5the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man  neither shall a man put on a woman s garment  for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.
our western world likes to take these faiths and bend them to their first world desires  Im a bit of a spiritual seeker and interested in reading up on a lot of different faiths and I always see this type of questioning from people. people put their flesh and lust ahead of our spiritual needs.
I remember when you were seemingly the  it girl  of youtube gaming and facebook gaming  2015-2018 ish  . I just thought you were  another gamer gurl  who was getting a big push and I dont remember any criticism of you back then.  these are just my memories or personal judgements of which I could be in the wrong . if you are new  I cantestify to the hype and push and  love  I thought melonie was getting back then  being in the industry then . this is just to back up her early statements in the video in reference to the john verse about loved hated.
a short time  in what is God willing  a very long life for you.
honestly  itsucks being a Christian in the uk when our official church is advocating this instead of the truth.btw  regarding your rebellious phase  have you ever made a video about it  it would be interesting and maybe helpful for others to hear what lead you astray and also what brought you back.
when these people utter anything about love- I feel sexually assaulted and disgusted

oh you have a dog. a cat  too  and I dont really believe in God. or not in the bibel as something other than made by other humans  even  if its good advice. I understand some things a bit different  like people created in the image of God. I always understood that as something about the soul and love  because nothing really talks about how God looks  and human bodies are a product of evolution. but our  soul   humanity  makes us human. so I think  if we love  we are in a certain way  like God . but I dont believe in that as some kind of entity in the way the church tells you. not so  interactive . more like free will  character  choise  improvement and so on. and the life as something  where the soul can learn and can become something greater. and thats not just 1 life  but that the  next step  comes after the soul becomes  what itshould be. and I believe in free will  in some kind of learning by doing  and some people need more time  others less  I once made an experience with my heart stopping to beat with 16  and it really was interesting  and my reason for not really being atheist. especially  my lung was destroyed  there are pictures  but itsuddenly healed  and I asked the professor  how it could be. and he just said  he doesnt know  but wonders happen  and thats known. but things that happened are a whole different topic  and in the end I dont know facts  I just believe things. and the most important part is about the value. but I dont really like the church and people giving orders in God s name.but here I just think  its a bit like hijacking. is it really necessary  not being Christian  not being non-binary  but make a big deal out of that. making everything political  making everything relogious  because they totally know  it will cause conflict. why going on tv  telling  God made all the genders  my making it a topic  it feels like using religion to get attention and peoples support  fame  and thats arrogant and how you should not be in Christianity. my problem isn t that this person is priest  but that this person does it in a selfish way to feel special  knowing  its offensive to a lot of people. because that are the same people  that call you things  if you for example point out how it is with women s rights in some religions. they tell you  you shouldn t hurt religious feelings  but they do it.the struggle with God  I once needed help. and there was a priest. he had to struggle  because he had a lot to do with couples divorcing. and he lost his faith because of what they did. but he stayed  until he lost his faith in humans  and believed  there is nothing  not even real love. than I came  not knowing about his struggle. told him my story. and what I told him  he said  thats true love  and he would feel like the lost sheep brought back to the flock. was in bamberg here in germany. he told me  he saw God s message in my words  and God would test my faith. he spoke about having the opinion  soon some bad things will happen  and that love dissapears  people are scared  and everything gets colder  and he thinks  such things are important  people should know. it was in 2018. its a longer story  but he was in his 40 s  and he had to struggle  too. and for him  it was a wonder  because he wanted to leave the day after. my e-mail should be the last to read as clergyman  and it changed everything for him. for me too  btw. becuase itshowed me  my own problems can mean a lot to others. others care  and fighting  and especially solving them  can give other people hope. and I dont even really am Christian  and I am protentant  he catholic  and he knew. it was totally different than I expected  he didn t expect that  he gave up a long time ago  but we helped out each other by just speaking about our struggles. so yeah  I guess  sometimes wonder happen. edit  and I think  even if you dont believe  you should see that as culture. as rules. see the Christians as a global society  and the rules about preventing this society from getting destroyed. and if you intentionally break the rules  its an offense and like trying to destroy this society. its not just about respect  but about something  that connects people  and helpt to keep the world in balance and peaceful. no matter if people believe or not  it contributes to peace and brings people together. and you shouldn t disturb a huge community like that. and if the people in the uk where this person lives are fine with that  ok. but you dont have to go on tv and make such a big deal out of it  knowing  that a lot of people dont agree  and not just a little part. especially if you are part of a very aggressive movement  that loves to hijack  to take over  to corrupt and to destroy  and people know it. if woke people wouldn t corrupt and destroy  it would be different  but its known what they do  if they become part of a group  and beiing on tv pointing out you are woke while knowing all that is just awful imo. its harmful and selfish. even not as Christian  I dont agree with things like that. I dont see any other reason for that than being arrogant and selfish  not caring about others and the church  but wanting support and attention  no matter what it costs...
can I ask when all of this non binary stuff started happening   Im 32 Ive always known of gay people s and trans peoples but I have never in my life heard of non binary until like like a few years ago  like wtf is even going on
proof that God loves variety  the platypus!
I really want to get my faith back I to live in sin and I want out of it. away from it. I hope its not to late
the Bible also says   tho shall not worship false idols and these  progressive  Christianity advocates are sharing false idolment
you go based Christian.
so say someone who had been saved had an ongoing  years-long addiction  lived in that mess  found help  but was still living in that lifestyle  is there any hope for people in those situations
melonie you will not get any native words from me   it is wonderful that you have come unto this path   I hope the very best for   there was a person who just died that is now in the news elvis presley s daughter   now I dont weather she is saved or not   but life is so short and can end very fast   she was 54 years old true many die much younger   but like thatsaying I have heard   now I dont know it word pre word   but today is the day of salvation   so a person needs to come to God our creator   through Jesus our Lord and savior   and the sooner the better . I like your video   and the courage and strength you have shown with this video   God bless you melonie .
glory be to God for dappled things     for skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow       for rose-moles all in stipple upon trout thatswim fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls  finches  wings    landscape plotted and pieced   fold  fallow  and plough       and  ll tr des  their gear and tackle and trim.all things counter  original  spare  strange    whatever is fickle  freckled  who knows how        with swift  slow  sweet  sour  adazzle  dim he fathers-forth whose beauty is past change                                 praise him.
amazing video
uk has gone way more woke to the extreme
you can minimize your picture in obs with  different scenes btw. some more effort would probably help getting more views. also  why there is no sound
yup!
everytime I see this I wonder if the person saying it believes women and pants dont mix.
its the cult of self  its about personal satisfaction  validation  and fulfilling fleshly desires and base instincts. its easy  whereas God calls us to be above such things  to be in the world and not of it.
welcome to capitalism mate
yup  right on point! when I first got into the gaming industry I was still a Christian and I was told by some insiders at a company I was interning at that they had concerns about hiring me full time because they didn t like that I was a Christian. I was told multiple times to do things I was uncomfortable with or  you ll never get a job in this industry and we wont hire you  like going to after parties at clubs  or being pressured to drink. I then took the coward route and stayed silent about my faith  which then helped me get more work  and eventually I turned away from my faith altogether  and it was at that time that I hit my peak in gaming industry recognition and people in the industry accepting me  I had no backlash at all. then I came back to my faith and I am blacklisted from most of the industry and lost at least 90  of my connections Imade therein. worth it. no regrets. my only regret is ever taking the coward route in the first place.
I just remember seeing her on ads and promos and items of that nature back in the day -- being promoted.  now I can see the opposite  backlash .
its not too late  I promise! bless you. dive into the word of God and ask him to lead you  he will
first thing  pray. open your heart to God. find other believers who can support your walk with Christ. God is always with us  believers and non-believers  he calls to each of us because we are his. he calls to each of us at different times and in different ways  but he is always looking to being us back  we are his flock  he is the good shepard. know your weakness and struggles  give yourself completely to him that he may guide you to the right path. its hard because there are so many distractions and noise in the world that pulls us away from his voice. best thing I found to help me is going into the wilderness  a hime or a camping trip  finding myself a spot off the trail and closing my eyes to take in my surroundings. God brought you here  he led me to this comment that Imay share my experience with you  he moved melanie to make this video  he moves your heart to recognize your spiritual need for him and the spiritual sickness you feel. God wants you back in his flock.I hope nothing but the best for you  friend.
yup  self worship!
based angloid protestants! hell yeah!
@kurioscomics  john chapter 8 for more on that.
we cannot willfully sin   live sinful lifestyles and go to heaven according to hebrews 10 26. obviously we will slip up and mess up sometimes  but to willfully live a sinful lifestyle is to not accept Jesus  sacrifice.
@melonie mac go boom  when I wrote what I wrote  I was speaking for myself. over the past twenty years  Ive been stuck in a self-destructive binge purge cycle using the internet. been living with my guilt  shame self-hatred since I was about 10-12 years old. I want to quit. part of me is afraid of essentially letting go of my best friend. Im sick and tired of being sick and tired. I do not wish to burden you with my story. I just ask for the same thing I pray for every day  that God would change my heart to desire what he desires  while I still draw breath.
yes. but that individual has to make active steps to change their ways. I like to keep in mind that God helps those who help themselves. prayer without action is just words  pray for help then make the changes. we all struggle with various sins and vices and we must make moves to be better. God wants us to be better  to be more than we are.
I just want to clarify that I didn t post this poem in agreement with the nb  priest  melonie is talking about. its simply a beautiful poem praising God that I thought people should read if they ve never read it before. its called  pied beauty  by gerard manley hopkins
Im a God fearing man  I truly believe in jehovah  he is the reason to be to all beings
we had it wrong.  the asteroid was the hero in armageddon.
speaking as a non Christian  I would appreciate it if you tried to implement the Bible verse in every video because it opens up quite a bit of discussion and a point of view not  a lot of people get to see everyday. things that are worth thinking about  even if you aren t a believer of that particular religion ideology
hey Imade a cameo lol! pause on 37 52 I am emeraldserpent1997! I am now moderately famous lol!!but in all seriousness very informative and spiritual video  good work melonie!!!
oh hey. heresy. cool.
I remember when I was still young as a Christian thinking that God was rather harsh in the old testament. today  I think we need a little more old testament in our lives.
morality and values are something that you have to put on the scale and discover by yourself the balance between good and evil  because not everything is white or black  there are some many shades and that is why sometimes we make mistakes. I dont have the answers  but I know that you dont need a priest to tell you to be a good person  priests and churches are human creations  the Bible is a book written for humans. its a spiritual guide not a book that you should follow blindly without having read it by yourself and understanding what its about. something that I really recommend  especially in these times when the evil really is pushing us towards the chaos.  I live in london and Im sick of this. to be honest I clicked on your vid melonie because its you and I know that you are a religious person and I know what this charade means to you  and I wanted to support  but to be honest  Im tired of this  for me its disgusting and simply I really dont want to spend one second of my life giving these pp the attention they want  they are narcissistic and attention seekers  so the best is to ignore them.   please remember you are the church of yourself and wherever you go God will be always with you. dont hate them  simply ignore them and if they need help or care  of course they are humans  and we should not make difference. but they choose to live their lives in that way and if they think they have the medical and psychological care and support they need  its their choice  they will have to live with that. I personally dont think they are being really treated as they should  I think the progressive part of society is making a huge mistake  same as they are doing with a lot of things  and we will pay for this mistake in the future.
the literal church of woke
I am an atheist and still  this is madness...... society can not evolve into this...... one thing is kindness and understanding things even if you do not agree .... and another thing is this  thing     edit  this goes against everything any religion exists on this planet
great vid great thoughts
no such thing as non binary  sick of hearing thatshit
I agree with what you are saying- but I usually stay away from labels like progressive and conservative. the Bible promotes some of both.love the immigrant and serve the poor   progressive. wait until marriage before becoming intimate   conservative.
I dont like the idea thatsome sins are worse. because the result of this is often that you allow yourself easier to fell in the smaller sins. any sin  as small as it may be  has the potential to separate you completely from Christ.also  I feel thatsexual sins are the easiest to bash against. but there are worse sins than sexual ones like pride or judgement. and Christ can allow you to be slave to these sexual sins so you may cultivate humility.there was a monastic story I read. there was a monk who took a young child and taught him to stay away from women  to pray all the time  to fast. and this child passed away when he was a young man. so this monk prayed to God about his spiritual child asking where did he get to live eternity. he was shocked to see this young man in hell. an angel told the old monk  you taught him to stay away from women  to pray  to fast but you never taught him to be humble. he was full of pride and this is why he is in hell.
amen
God really loves all genders. you have to love yourself and your faith.
I just see a priest letting the real him to come out... a predator  they always touched the altar boy but never the altar girl.
deez
one thing is not following herds that act  woke  but going into another herd is not any better
remember... hate the sin not the sinner. guide them to salvation. we in faith will never be  perfect   we are only human. perfection is something to strive for. it is a guiding light that cuts through the darkness.I have faith  but I dont consider myself a good practitioner. I do my best to live by the golden rule in most things for when my hourglass has run its course I shall be judged. if true in the way we understand itshall guide my soul to its rightful destination.
27 02I feel attacked .. I ate cinnabon yesterday and im about to eat pizza right now.
the anglicans are good goys!
I thought buddhism and hinduism were pretty accepting and chill with a lot of stuff
bahaha
I agree that God does love variety. just look at the diverse amount of flora and fauna on earth. God sure doesnt love depravity  though...
these people are legitimately crazy.
oh yeah. God really loves that kind of variarity. just ask sodom and gomorrah. literal purge by fire. lmao
God bless you for calling out this travesty to God
anyone who is really curious about the Bible and what it really says  I would encourage you to check out dr. chuck missler s series  the Bible in 24 hours  available on youtube from konoinia house.  his take is from an engineer perspective and it really hits a lot different than many other Bible studies.  check it out!  when you get done with those 24 episodes  you might want to examine his  beyond...  series if you like science and are curious how the Bible interacts with modern physics.
it would be nice if I actually heard the video when you played it...
to me all sincerely good people belong to the same church. even if some of us go to a church  a synagogue  or a masque.
liked  shared
the videos you played are muted
I never used to understand how good Christians could throw people onto a pyre for what seemed to be simple error. ... now I begin to understand. caedite eos. he will know his own
this is blasphemy of the highest order...it is good that you shine a light on this darkness melonie!
like what brandon s daughter wrote about in her d I a r y
it is odd that there are some murderers in prison  that are more saved  than some of the people that attend church every sunday. as john 3 17 says  Jesus came to save the world  not to condemn it.matthew 5 43-48 you have heard that it was said   you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.  but I say to you  love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you  so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven.
there was a church that had a priest and bingo was his name-o
the uk is pretty much lost in my opinion.
in regards to the tattoos  I dont think its  sinful  to get tattoos because its not in the new testament. even then what about getting tattoos that honor Christ  many tattoos imo would spell out a tragic past  mental problems
Im an atheist  I grew up in church though. I dont understand why so many people try to change a religion to suit themselves. either you believe or you dont. if you believe that God is real then it makes sense that you have to stick to the rules or get punished. if you dont  it makes sense that you would do whatever you want to because your belief is there would be no consequences. I vaguely remember a verse in the Bible saying to treat your body like a temple  so I guess for a believer chopping off your weaner and testies is probably a bad idea. also believe it or not the Bible speaks out against homosexuality  it list men who lie with men among the things that God hates. Im not religious  just weighing in on the matter.
did you have the sound off on the clip for copyright issues
chaplet of devine mercy.eternal father  I offer you the body and blood  soul and divinity of your dearly beloved son  our Lord Jesus Christ  in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world  for the sake of his sorrowful passion  have mercy on us. Jesus I trust in you.
just  just... people nowadays must go through tests to confirm their brain function before they re allowed to have any access to the internet.
oops  well there were subtitles at least. sorry about that lol!
@melonie mac go boom  might wanna reupload
great video though. love it.
so is the us  we gotta do something about this. stand up against it and continue to pray for our nations  that is the only way we can fix this mess
@melonie mac go boom  I agree  at least  living here in the us. I can experience firsthand the good still here. the good people who are in line and I can rely on in our faith when there s questions to be had. watching the things happening in this world and of this world has been very alarming.   keep up the great videos  melonie. Im a new viewer here and had seen you years ago thinking you were just another gamer girl channel. it was a pleasant surprise actually watching one of your videos months ago.
definitely fits the rise of the 10 kingdoms
@melonie mac go boom  deus vult
@the kross its funny how europeans and uk citizens say we are the messed up ones then we say the opposite.I feel like as humans we dont really know whats going on in a manner of difference at all.especially in nations unlike ours.
bet this is episcopalian. Im sick and tired of these people using the word of God to validate their lifestyle. Jesus said do not conform to this world but be transformed by his word.
6 06 for this to be true  does that imply that humans are never going to reach a utopia until the end of revelations  that there will always be some  big bad  for us to contest  if so  thats kinda bleak
the overt acceptance of sin reminds me of ezekiel 23  a prophecy against jerusalem and samaria thats pretty much erotica. not exaggerating in any way.
this priest probably loved this movie as a child and remembers this clip  I strangely remember this specific part. https   www.youtube.com watch v by9hcgepzry
the creator made each soul.  our person shared the dimension of him before the foundations of this world.when the choice is made to accept a destructive existence  such a thing will be given encouragement andbe allowed  as in the same guidelines of a beneficial  behavior  so to mature and give final proof of the act.
verity is a great name though.
why do you subject us to this blasphemy
the Bible as the word of God describes these people as wolves in sheep s clothing.....
God bless you for calling this out for what it is...sinful.  it makes me wonder when he says that God loves  variety   what exactly he s talking about   because he cant be talking about God the father.  my guess is that these woke people have some made up God that they are always talking about.
hey melonie first is good to see that dog over there and second people can be weird somethimes.
being  non-binary  means he doesnt like the way God made him so he took it upon his mortal self to change what God made.  I question his motives for becoming a priest if he feels God made him wrong.
great video. thank you! what is the name of the song thats the exitsong for the videos.
ahh very brave and stunning...jewish rabbis and muslim imams should also do this. they should also allow drag shows in their synagogues and temples.  what s the problem  no trans rabbis or trans imams  please. someone explain this to the class.
I just wanted to let you know that I dont have a good enough reason to watch this video  some things you cant unwatch   but I wanted to thank you for allowing yourself to be dragged through the mire.  I was saved as an adult  so Imade the choice to accept and study and learn and believe.  two simply phrases I love are   God doesnt believe in atheists   and  a God that is small enough for me to completely understand isn t big enough to save me from my sins .so there are the basic supported truths that I have learned  and with that there are some ideas people that we are just supposed to stay clear of.  however  maybe this will create a platform for people to question the unGodly and seek God s truth  and that would be terrific.
I think tattoos are legit in Christianity.  itspecifically talks about pagan rituals in regards to tattoos.  so  unless you have ritualistic tattoos  youre fine.
your dog looks like a good sidekick in a zombie apocalypse! sorry if its a cat.
God does love variety  but that doesnt include varieties of sin.
melonie its ok
yes God loves variety  thats why there are different species of organisms on this planet. we are but one of them and consist of two sexes!
tbh Imight just buy the Christian manga Bible  cause Im more into manga.
anglo-protestant. church of england to be exact. but yeah  episcopalians are anglicans just like them.
yup  we re gonna face spiritual warfare and hate from people until we re dead and in heaven. put on your armor of God and stay vigilant haha! bring it on  we got this!
where did you get the idea there was a utopia before revelation the belief in the Bible often contradicts with any bright future for humans.at least sometimes although even as a Christian myself if that future ever came it would raise some doubts but I also feel the same way about total human extinction in a natural or manmade way.
and if you do even just for some fun or some kind of family culture  what youre damned forever
these beliefs just kind of make it hard to keep the hope God is loving.I get love isnt God but God is love thing but goodness its just very dictator like to be that way.gives too much merit to the concept thatsatan is more on the side of people than God thatsome atheists hold.
do it! I want to buy one too
there is a manga Bible  I need that. my dad had a picture Bible and it was basically a comic omnibus of major stories like the fall of jericho and moses slappin  rocks.
@anonymous cheese  I d buy the manga off amazon.
I think its because Im sending links my comments are getting deleted  but in case you didn t see them  I d strongly urge you to check out robert breaker s study on heb 10 because I believe you are misunderstanding what the verse is really saying there and you are taking it out of its proper context based on some other videos Ive seen of yours. he s a great pastor!but yes otherwise I agree with you wholeheartedly about progressive Christianity. I cannot fathom advocating for sin and yet calling myself a Christian. its sad to see people thinking that others who call themselves  Christians  are actually that. like raphael warnock for example. and yet he calls himself a  pro choice  pastor. its just absolutely disgusting. seriously though thank you for spreading real Christianity even if I disagree with some viewpoints of yours.
I believe the attempts to bully people into having guilt solely for how they were born or a mistake they made in the distant past is a deeply antiChristian thing. over and over in the new testament  sinners were told to repent and sin no more. they were forgiven their burdens as a new person. when saul became paul he didn t mope about shamefully for having murdered Christians  he focused on moving forward and growing. Im sure he felt absolutely sick when he realized exactly what he had done  but it wasn t some unforgivable millstone. fellow Christians didn t constantly bring up how he had murdered them to make him feel bad.it is also something where there is a value to being aware of your advantages  but it has been twisted and oversimplified to include many who did not have any advantages and has been twisted to be a lifelong burden of shame that must be carried.
if youre a Christian then idk how you could not vote for maga trump cause we are the only people standing up for Christians in the world!
Im convinced that if you consider yourself to be a Christian  but youre never offended or challenged by what Christ commands us to do and be  you may need to reevaluate your relationship with him  because the real Jesus does not tolerate sin. he is not content to leave a person sinful  and wont be pleased unless the whole person is purged of sin and transformed to look like him. that process includes a lot of pruning of our sin and the things that lead us to sin. that means some parts of our lives have to be cut off  and its not pleasant to us. so if the Jesus you ve been sold only ever affirms you  that one s a sham that will only lead you to hell. following Christ means that who you were has to die daily so that you can live. the cost of following him is high  but there s nothing more worth doing.
y know in the future I can see you becoming a priest later in your life as you are strong in your faith  youre well versed in his holy word  and youre just so likable in general. I am glad that you are taking a stand against this  conforming Christianity  junk and telling people that its a ll just smoke and mirrors and is just essentially to try and gaslight Christians and believers in God into conforming into evil desires presented to use by satan.
Im not Christian  but I think your video needs a better title to get Christians  attentions who were saying that the Bible never said a marriage s between a man and woman only  or that b f and g f intercourse isn t adultery.
interesting to watch a protestant view on sin from a catholic prospective
bingo  ..allison  .I think a few of my brain cells just committed suicide one by one  its a good thing that Im a Christian cause the good Lord has kept me safe and sane.
Imay be a hellenist  I worship the ancient greek Gods   but there is just something about all of this I disagree with on principal that has nothing to do with who she worships. the levels of hedonism is just wrong.
God does love variety  but he also made man and woman  no others. this is sad.
that right there is a wolf in sheep s clothing.
I dont think it needs to be said  but sexual immorality is primarily  with exceptions  focused outside of marriage. inside of marriage you can be your  freaky self  with your partner as much as you like as long as its kept between the two of you inside the bonds of marriage. I think thats one of the  deaths by 1000 cuts  that marriages are suffering these days  they treat anything sexual inside their marriage felt between each other as taboo despite thats one of the reasons that you get married and in order to procreate you kind of have to do the thing to make it.that aside as a really weird opener  while being  non-binary  in and of itself isn t sacrilidge  its what follows is. its the acceptance and hand-waiving away of sinful lifestyles that are detrimental on a physical  mental  and spiritual level. I had a discussion with my former pastor  moved  so former  about how to address people in the alphabet community. its tough  legitimately tough and I dont envy pastors preachers who want to share Christ s love with these people but at the same time they have to tell these people that they re living in sin. Christ welcomed sinners into his midst to help them  but didn t enable them to continue that lifestyle. but we re human  we want to be accepted. why else would we mirror people that we like  its something so ingrained in our psyches and once you become aware of it  you can understand why preachers falter and have such great difficulty with this  especially in a time where Christians are demonized and insulted on a daily basis  yet those same people who insult Christians would be hard-pressed to do it to the other two abrahamic faiths lest they be called istaphobes  or be stoned thrown off a roof for one in particular  because we are told to  turn the other cheek  and dont fight back. its difficult and understandable why many would falter.
straight white single Christian male here  orthodox   according to the media these days I barely know how to read  so Im going to take a stab at this with my feeble gray matter  Im pretty sure the Bible says there are only two genders on its first page. its not that difficult! even I can do it!draws a rainbow with his arms above his head  as he is smiling warmly
as a baptist  Im not terribly familiar with catholic dogma  my question in this regard is do the parishioner s regard the  priest  as father
Im watching the original clip at the source.  priest  bingo talks about an essay he wrote and a verse he read in the Bible thatsays  male and female  God created them in my experience with the church all priests will start a verse with the book and chapter the verse is from. what self respecting priest fails to do that  what self respecting priest paraphrases the holy Bible
wait  shouldn t it be a nun  lmfao.
while it is not wrong that God loves variety  he made plants  tress  grass and animals look different. that also include us. it is not the variety that person is referring to.also there is even scriptures that refer how a man and a woman should dress and the length of their hair. it also refers to how long hair bring glory to women while long hair is dishonor to men  1 corinthians 11 14-15
and bingo was his name-o.
this . . . whatever this is . . . is free to believe whatever it wants.  but Christianity is an established religion.  it has rules and beliefs you are required to adhere to if you want to call yourself a Christian.  you cant just go off whatever your feelz are and say its the Christian God s will.  technically in a free society you can claim whatever you want.  but if youre called to judgment as the Christian religion professes there may be a few problems getting past the angelic tsa at the pearly gates if you live by your own rules and not those set down by God.
if this is now the stance of the church                                                                     then reparations of billions needs to be paid to the survivors of its murder over the last 2000 years
Im not a catholic  I dunno why so many people think I am lol
this differs with belief many people do hold the idea that being freaky inside a marriage is sinful.thats why the missionary position even freaking exists because it was deemed the only acceptable position for sex.
or maybe some woke garbage like zather. lol
we might also pay for every issue caused by every race and other religion and country and government too its hard to narrow down and repay for the blood spilt by long dead ancestors and long dead victims unfortunately.
are you a fellow steelers fan too  just when I thought this girl couldn t get any hotter
if I were to meet that  minister   I would ask her  assuming that thing is a her  to cite her sources. cite me the chapter and the verse of the Bible thatstates that God loves variety. otherwise  youre merely partaking in nothing less than heresy. last time I checked  God loves obedience more than sacrifice  or anything else.
these people are insane.
melonie mac if youre looking for a genuine and more traditional Christian church then I suggest you attend your local eastern orthodox church  preferably a greek orthodox church  their traditions and practices are much more genuine and traditional  more akin to the original catholic church  have a chat to the priest after a sunday morning service  Im sure they ll welcome you with open arms
lets be fair shes not entirely incorrect as God did make a lot of diverse things in life.not really including the non binary thing I guess but still.
and im sure there are plenty of other  priests  that he can enjoy their company in the warm glow of hell.
romans 1 26-27 which says   because of this  God gave them over to shameful lusts. even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. men committed indecent acts with other men  and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. how can one read this and conclude that the Bible says sexual acts involving same sexed individuals could be anything but  shameful lusts   unnatural relations   indecent acts   received...due penalty for their perversion ....... did you hear that ....  due penalty for their perversion ......perversion of what   natural relations . this passage is plain and clear. God called homosexual acts  shameful lusts    unnatural perversion  and will have a  penalty . end of story.and Imust point out that this part of the passage  in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another  is clearly stating that the  natural relations  the writer is referring to here are the  natural relations  a man has with a women and not the relations a man has with another man even if they both feel as if it is natural for them. dont get me wrong.....God gave man free will  and here in america one is free to have sex with whom he she pleases.if one wants to satisfy their lust for each other in ways that God did not intend  then by all means  let them go for it. just do not say that God s word justifies their actions.if one sticks up their middle finger at God in rebellion and says  I dont give a sh__t what you want. I am going to do it my way.  instead of confessing that they are a sinner and are trying their best not to sin  then they will get exactly what they wanted......the rest of eternity with their own made up fake Gods and not the real  God . this goes just as well for every other sin under the sun not just homosexuality. are we to love and help those that practice what God has called  shameful lusts   unnatural relations   indecent acts  and  perversion   well yes we are  they are the very ones Jesus died for  but even Jesus after stopping the stoning of the women caught in the act of adultery said to her  go and sin no more . accepting and affirming the perverse behavior of those that practiced such things is essentially telling them that their behavior is ok with God despite God s clear opposition to those behaviors. keep in mind that if God did indeed make the universe and all mankind then it is he that would know what is best for us... if you chose not to take his advice then the results you suffer are your own fault.p.s. millstones are very heavy .. pray for these pastors leading the children astray.
variety  yes. the alphabet community  no  he destroyed the world for that
God loves variety sooo much  that he only created two sexes. thats it. and he designed each with a role to play. amazing how people believe what these psychos peddle  but the word of God is just too far fetched for them.
the reason I left Christianity was the crusades.  the lack of them. its been almost a thousand years guys its time to get back on the wagon against heathens.
thanks!
some valid questions here   which God   Im not asking you  melonie. Im asking this so-called priest.  which God    which Christ    what exactly do you think the the source of moral authority   people will make all kinds of claims  many of which are flat out contradictions and lies.  I ll give you one of my favorites. Imeet high school history teacher who hissed at me simply for folding my hands and bowing my head to give thanks for my lunch. was this guy an agnostic  or atheist  or pagan  no!  he said he was a Christian. when I asked him to define what he meant by that  it took me a few tries  but he finally and vehemently said that Jesus wasn t God  wasn t from God  the Bible was a lie  he didn t pray to that  corruption   he instead prayed to buddha  had a buddha statue in his home and his office which he prayed to  and he read the alimanI daily. that  made him a Christian. ... yeah. completely deranged. talk about an insult to Christ and to buddha.
love you
this is why the mainline denominations are dying out and the growth in Christianity is all in the conservative congregations.
Im not a Christian anymore. I got tired of the constant   if you do  insert whatever   youre going to hell!  from taking a piss  to growing my hair  and beard. well if Im damned no matter what  I choose the old Gods. I live my life by the nine virtues  and am honestly happier. no disrespect to you  or the God of this realm. I just choose to not listen to hell fire preaching about literally everything. that in my eyes is not a God love  and forgiveness  but a God of ego  and hatred.
can you tell us about your fleshly desires
that priest leading people to hell. I got a few verses that describe him very well  20 woe unto them that call evil good  and good evil  that put darkness for light  and light for darkness  that put bitter for sweet  and sweet for bitter!  isaiah 5 20 30 a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land 31 the prophets prophesy falsely  and the priests bear rule by their means  and my people love to have itso  and what will ye do in the end thereof   jeremiah 5 30-31 13 but he answered and said  every plant  which my heavenly father hath not planted  shall be rooted up.14 let them alone  they be blind leaders of the blind. and if the blind lead the blind  both shall fall into the ditch.  matthew 15 13-14  27 woe unto you  scribes and pharisees  hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres  which indeed appear beautiful outward  but are within full of dead men s bones  and of all uncleanness.28 even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men  but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  matthew 23 27-28  33 ye serpents  ye generation of vipers  how can ye escape the damnation of hell   matthew 23 33 6 he answered and said unto them  well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites  as it is written  this people honoureth me with their lips  but their heart is far from me.7 howbeit in vain do they worship me  teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  mark 7 6-7 if that  non-binary  priest doesnt get saved very quickly  he will burn in the lake of fire for his lies. rome enslaves  Jesus completely saves
I thought bingo was a dog in a song
25 and he shall speak great words against the most high  and shall wear out the saints of the most high  and think to change times and laws  and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.-daniel 7 255  and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies  and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.6 and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God  to blaspheme his name  and his tabernacle  and them that dwell in heaven.7 and it was given unto him to make war with the saints  and to overcome them  and power was given him over all kindreds  and tongues  and nations.8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him  whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world.-revelation 13 5-8
kind of a stupid comparison to make when you think about it. there s an unimaginable number of tidally-locked planets across the infinite expanse of our universe.
sodom and gomorrah comes to mind.
@anonymous cheese  exactly
youre amazing  thank you so much
thank you very much for this video! it really helped me put allot of things in perspective and motivate and guide me to to get back on tract in my faith. thank you for sharing your story and God bless! look forward to your future videos!
I think the old testament says shaving is actually sinful
@chandler burse  Im not entirely sure if it does or not. I was always told to shave my beard  and cut my hair short.either way  I wasn t fond of the wrath  hell fire   fear him or else  God commands it.  preaching.
we were warned that in the last days  the church will fall.    raise your head  for your redemption is near!
God s love is highly conditional! selfish deity
I let this auto roll  did not expect such a heavy Christian tilt based on previous videos  color me surprised. not here to spread hate  all are responsible for their own beliefs. I can see why you feel the way you do. if you have to mutate the values of your faith to justify breaking it  perhaps its not the right institution for you. sort of supports my belief that institutional religions will dive right into hypocrisy to uphold their status and power at the expense of their professed ideology be it inconvenient.catholics still haven t sufficiently responded to the 250 000 abused children in france alone that they covered up for who knows how long.
3 00 19 for the natural man is an enemy to God  and has been from the fall of adam  and will be  forever and ever  unless he yields to the enticings of the holy spirit  and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord  and becometh as a child  submissive  meek  humble  patient  full of love  willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him  even as a child doth submit to his father.mosiah 3 19. book of mormon
you can shorten the face cam   instead of just moving it to the side.   as for the topic at hand  I feel ill inside even acknowledging the so-called  priest   but suffice to say our views are aligned.
ok due to how my country works  I have to ask  what branch of Christianity you belong to   my family are largely protestant but we have largely abandoned religion due to how divisive it is.  we re very live and let live however so you can believe what you want as long as its not harming anyone.  dont get me wrong though  the woke mob are a new kind of cult that needs to be crushed due to how dangerous their belief system is to children.
how did they even become a priest
it would be funny if it wasn t so serious. the fact that this woke cult is now openly appropriating Christianity is terrifying.
earth is a reality show of the Gods.
terrifying
God didn t even let adam eating an apple  thats the extension of God s fondness for  variety.  God loves us all but you are going to heiI if youre a sinner  and a sin is a variety out of what s accepted in Christianity. why is thatso hard to understand even from a pragmatic pov Jesus didn t walk among pr0stitutes and thiefs because  he was having a good time with the homies   he did it because we re all humans but they all went to heiI if they didn t repent. its simple as that...although this priest is from the church of england so there s no use talking about this...
for someone all about the lessons of the Bible and judgement  you sure seem to forget timothy 2 12. Im sure its okay for you to just ignore that bit. its not like the whole Bible is what matters. only what you find convenient. please check your eye for splinters first  tend your own garden  and have a good day.
the only disagreement I have is that you say there are levels of sin. the Bible clearly states that all sin is equal in the eyes of the Lord.
we are not made righteous by our obedience. we are made righteous by Jesus  obedience.  romans 5   19 kjv  a Godly life is the fruit of complete trust in Jesus  finished work on the cross. it is not what keeps us saved. we live right when we rest in Jesus  finished work. no saved person sins without guilt. the guilt is a sign you are saved if you worry you ve lost your salvation for anything you ve done. no saved person has guiltless sin. the sin however cannot undo what Jesus has done for those who put their trust in his finished work. hebrews 10   26 is one of the most misunderstood verses taken out of context in the Bible. the sin being spoken of in chapter 10 of hebrews is the sin of continual animal sacrifice israel was doing after they received the knowledge of the truth  that Christ died for their sins . for them to offer animal sacrifice in place of Jesus  blood for their sins then there remained no sacrifice for their sins. Jesus  sacrifice is the only one God accepts to pay for our sins today. the book of hebrews was written specifically to the hebrews to address this problem  as well as other things concerning them. its why the book is titled hebrews.
rip world
ah yes the Bible  written by imperfect man but believed as the word of God. a book of truth and lies just like all spiritual texts. galatians 3 28  kjv  there is neither jew nor greek  there is neither bond nor free  there is neither male nor female  for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.to build the kingdom of God requires us to unite under Jesus Christ but everyone is hyper focused on how they re different  how their religion is the only true one and every other Christ worshipping religion is wrong. this scripture is telling us to look past the illusions of this mortal life and unite in Christ s name and be as he was. help people and create ripples of love in every direction  not ripples of hate.sin is spreading ripples of hate. if you are not hurting others your are not sinning. the woke cult is lost and deceived  but so is the conservative cult. satan is all over american politics manipulating the masses to fight each other.its very important in these times to develop a truthful humble honest and deep relationship with God and Jesus Christ  and stop treating the Bible like its God. God is God. the Bible is a book.this person has every right to be a priest as long as they re teaching people to spread love and kindness and help people in need.
Christ saves. does he not  if someone professes their salvation  who are any of us to argue that  can you say someone is  more saved  because they are straight  but they cheat on their wife  either Christ saves or he doesnt. he is the sacrificial lamb of God. and he died for  all  of us sinners. no exceptions. if we went by what the world preaches as  some skewed version  of salvation  we d all be f   ed. so amen God doesnt go by  our  standards when it comes to his business. straight or other  may God be with you all  and hold you safe in his arms  and carry you thru these times till the end and after. peace be with all
looks like uncle fester with a wig
all sins are equal  this is Christianity. a murderer can be saved if he accepts Jesus as his Lord and savior. all sin can separate someone from Christ. Jesus died for our sins because we are sinners and will be so. we will have happier lives if we keep away from sin though.
this is what happens when you cancel jerry springer.
so is a parent selfish for turning their kid into prison for being a murderer...
@melonie mac go boom  no thats sensible
Im not a pastor  I evangelize on social media. we all are told to evangelize  men and women. you do not seem very versed in the Bible if I had to explain thatsimple distinction to you.
@melonie mac go boom   you dont need to be a pastor to preach. discussing en masse your opinions on the Bible isn t preaching  sure. if you want to lie to yourself. how s thatsplinter  btw
where does itsay all sin is equal
@melonie mac go boom  romans 6 23    for the wages of sin is death.  it doesnt  parse which sin. all sin leads to death.
@melonie mac go boom  also  all sin is equal in that itseparates us from God.
@melonie mac go boom  james 2 10   for whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.  what he means is that individual sins cannot be isolated.
@nekbone  wrong  wrong  and wrong. no sins are  equal   dude  and this is a matter of you misinterpreting the Bible. proverbs 6 16-9. read it  educate yourself  and hopefully you ll grow up and be enlightened to the truth.
@nelbone na
@melonie mac go boom  omg  g for gosh  youreply to so many comments youre gonna get another stalker thinking youre in love with them
Jesus  sacrifice is why we are saved  but the Bible tells us that if we love Jesus we will keep his commandments. you cannot love Jesus while deliberately living a lifestyle of sin
@melonie mac go boom  there is no such thing as a saved person deliberately living in guiltless sin. if they are  they re only claiming to be saved while not really being saved. no one who believes they are a lost sinner on their way to hell chooses to believe Christ died for their sins just so they can sin happily and avoid the consequence. they believe Christ died for their sins because they want to be saved and know they cant save themselves. our salvation is not kept secure by our works. it is kept secure by the finished work of Christ. if someone says they are saved  yet live a guiltless life of depravity then were they really truly saved  that is the discernment to make here. the moment a person believes that Christ died for their sins  they are sealed with the holy spirit of promise.  ephesians 1   13 kjv  for as by one man s disobedience many were made sinners  so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.  romans 5   19 kjv adam s sin made us sinners. no amount of good we do can get us out of thatstate of being or make us righteous. Jesus  obedience makes all who believe he died for them righteous. that righteousness cannot be undone by our sin  which all saved people struggle with because of our sinful flesh. the power of Jesus  blood to save is far greater than the power of adam s sin to condemn. the discernment as I said above is that between a saved person and someone who says they are saved and yet lives in guiltless sin. its an issue of the heart.
@melonie mac go boom  most Christians dont even know that Jesus was only sent to the house of israel in his first coming. he was not sent to deal with gentiles at that time. matthew 15   24 kjv  but he answered and said  I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel.  he said this because God made a promise to abraham that Jesus was sent to fulfill. God separated abraham from the rest of the world and made him and his seed his people called israel. the rest of the world was cut off from God until after israel s final rejection of Jesus 1 year after he was raised from the dead and they stoned stephen to death as he was preaching the gospel of the kingdom. that is when Jesus arrested paul on the road to damascus and gave paul the revelation of the mystery  the body of Christ that will consist of both jew and gentile  and the gospel of grace that is for all whereas the gospel of the kingdom was for israel. God did this to provoke israel to jealousy.romans 11   11 kjv  I say then  have they stumbled that they should fall  God forbid  but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles  for to provoke them to jealousy.  salvation did not come to the gentiles until after israel rejected Jesus and paul was raised up to be the apostle to the gentiles. this is why paul s epistles are so different than matthew  mark  luke  john and james. Jesus was sent to deal with israel based upon the covenant God had with them. in paul s epistles he speaks of the body of Christ consisting of jews and gentiles and becoming a new creature. paul was the only one who spoke about this because it was revealed to him first. Jesus told his apostles to stay away from the gentiles in his first coming. Jesus told paul to go unto the gentiles after israel s final rejection of him. what matters is who Jesus is speaking to and why. when anyone is speaking in the Bible it is always important to know who they are speaking to and why. if we dont study the Bible with this discernment we will apply everything to ourselves when it had nothing to do with us to begin with.
all sins are not equal  I address this in this video. the Bible is very clear on what sins are abominations and worse than others
watch the full video  dude. your idea of Christianity is so warped and doesnt align with what it truly means.
God does  love variety.  because God loves humans  and humans are a diverse species. two things God doesnt like are discrimination or undue judgement.something that both these woke zealots and you mel should remember.
its just sick
what Bible version do youread
its okay to say g-d loves sinners....the catch is they have to be seeking repentance. and at the same time condemning their sin...but not them Im too tired to get out the book but...be very careful calling good evil and evil good. that is what s a problem here.Im already at my limit with people who misinterpret and or misrepresent the word.  after some goober on  facebook claimed its a sin to wear used clothing.
is it just me or is there no audio on the video she s playing
so is he in a missionary position
I do not think his wife really signed up for this much variety and he is really communicating with tik tok not God
...pushing the envelope...
are you a lacey sturm of flyleaf fan
unfortunately I cant hear what they re saying.
I think you are a bit harsh on you but in the end you made me think about sinning....doing so I think I sin every day. iol

eff. baby Jesus  why you hate us for the way we were born
oh no  Im in the uk  hadn t seen this but what is going on here
one of my best friends is Christian and sexist  I dont agree with his view on things but somehow we get along really well lol
we are not all like this. not long ago some guy was preaching in public. none of these people like Christianity  it has to conform to their modern lifestyle. every awkward thing in the Bible has to be explained away. they need their stupid signs and communities separate from the rest and we are supposed to throw everything out which has been achieved and pander to them    we have all we need  the heavy lifting has been done for us.
certainly not that type of variety.
yeah I done goofed and had it muted on obs lol!

Im surprised you got the words  non binary priest  out of your mouth.
everything that was written shall come to pass. the rise of false prophets and false teachings and the fact that the world is rejecting God as day goes by are signs the end is coming.
I saw a dog!
melonie  keep the new testament. keep the son close to your heart  but the father can drop dead anytime of his choosing like the millions he killed. dont confuse the old and the new  very different messages.
sorry  my bad on that

God creates a person person lives commits a sin person dies person is judged and sent to hell and is made into nothingness  person is created person lives......an angel taps God on the shoulder... my Lord what are you doing !
less arm pitty of you meloine mac
you should follow gothix  she has good Christian content.
heresy
also keep in mind sis you dont have to justify following God s word to the world they hated Jesus  first  God said bless are those who value God over the world bless are those who do not conform to the world all you gotta say is I stand by the teachings of my father in heaven and thats it it doesnt matter who gets offended it doesnt matter how they feel about it they have no power and no authority God has all the power and authority
cant hear the other video.
why dont youremove the sin on your skin .

nnnnnnnope.
trans and a priest.might as well wear a sign thatsays  check my hard drives
still simple just ask yourself  what would Jesus do  when he spoke to his followers did he do it wearing fine robes with gold and jewels and travel in a golden chariot pulled by white arabian horses or did he wear the robes of the common people and ride a donkey  when asked by a rich man how can I get into heaven Jesus said to him   if you wish to be complete  go and sell your possessions and give to the poor  and you shall have treasure in heaven  and come  follow me.  matthew 19 22

so youre saying everyone else is binary  and youre not that. which means there s either one or the other  confirming a binary. thanks.
well I dont know about you .but when I look at pastor heshe my shvinkter starts itching and throbbing .Im touched in places I thought didnt exist anymore she gives me gas theres one seat left and its on my face!!!!    wowy .
if God wanted variety he wouldn t of started the human race with one man and one girl
God will separate the rams from the sheep. those leading little ones astray will be getting mill stones
we already follow each other
where is this in the Bible  I remember a verse where Jesus said he did not come for healthy but the sick referring to the fact he came to help sinners not believers already.
@chandler burse  all men are sinners all men fall short of the grace of God there for all men need to repent and renew their mind to repent means to move away from the passes youre thinking about is luke 5 32 they wonder why Jesus sat with sinners  and he basically said the righteous dont need him because they are already righteous he came for sinners so that they may know repentance in no shape or form does that mean be buddy buddy with sinners it just means he came to them because they need his wisdom his power   those who reject Jesus he got up   walked away from
@luvGodBibletruth  Imean you said she should bless believers first but I argue Jesus would turn to unbelievers first before believers
@chandler burse  they hated Jesus first I should have put a comma there   I corrected the statement try reading it now
I am not Christian. this is disgusting and out of balance with the harmony of nature. this is manufactured chaos  which is wholly destructive   unacceptable.
this satisfies the flesh  ummm... who in the f is getting satisfaction from... him her they zer .. Imean if you where saying that about blair white then you would have a point but uhhh... well... idk about this one.
Imean what about all these passages which I could quote... you know this  man  hosting this tv show is actually a crybaby who has to bring his personal life on tv. funny enough he actually dated a very young guy...
heathens using God as a shield for their perversion is nothing new. they can intoxicate themselves with their  clever  arguments and sophistry but they will all still stand before God to be judged in the end.
God loves all
genesis 5 2 male and female he created them  and he blessed them.
this is totally unacceptable. its offensive. I dunno if uk churches enjoy tax free status. this church should have it revoked if so. what is the world coming to   disgusting. Im glad you chose to make a video melonie. youre an excellent Christian. God bless you.
super gross  super weird  super embarrassing. just 100  sad and pathetic.
that ain t no catholic priest if you ask me.
sigh
love the sinner not their sin. satan is like a lion roaming and seeking whom he may devour he is there to kill steal destroy a prerequisite and divide
well  as far as I know there isn t anything in the Bible thatsays you cant identify as non-binary  but the video is 45 minutes long so I assume she will provide biblical evidence. as far as  God loves variety   I think that is well proven by looking around at the diversty in life as well as the chemical physical world  but again she has 45 minutest to disprove that.edit  I am mostly finished. the video is pretty good  but doesnt literally focus on the title. it is more about  progressive  Christianity. she does mention that God made man and woman  but doesnt explicity explain how not feeling like a man or a woman is a sin.overall I enjoyed the video. I think I different title would have been better.
we are seeing the apostate church
progressive Christianity  is not Christianity  just as  the prosperity gospel  is not the gospel.God bless you sister
im not even religious   and I know this is wrong  and disgusting
God doesnt like it when people deny reality  like that thing is doing.
lady it takes all kinds to make a world  however that wont mean I wont tell a freak to shut the hell up however
hold that l  protestants. anglicans...based !
she brought the Bible modified for  modern audiences  and now think all is true while being ignorant of all the blood and gore and fire in the original Bible
that is just satanic...
feel like id get called antisemetic for askin for trans rabbI tho
most ppl dont know thatsatan is a name  a title  satan is actually an angel  his actually a beautiful creature but his pure evil  n his name means blasphemy  liar  deceiver  the snake of all evil.demons are angels as well n just as evil!those whom will b destroyed by the hand of God will perish 4 all eternity
Im not a person of faith but I seriously question who let s this things go through like is completely fine with Christianity and why you want to get inside a religion thats preached that youre lifestyle is not good in the eyes of God that doesnt make any sense to me.I walk away a long time ago youre walking between wolves instead of sheeps  there s no sinners that wants to change and help their  brothers  instead is a competition of who is less sinful.
God is nature!     Bible is written by man!     the laws of moses!  fire jinn  letters of paul  fairy tails  world  sexual pleasure   wicca is nature    spiritism!  sin  you have to live with your boyfriend or girlfriend before marriage  to find out everything about them!
rumble
this was foretold. the evil has already lost. it is perverting as many humans as it cantwist before its  thems and theys  are annihilated.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Jesus saves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hiw much you want to bet it gets to preach in the streets with no issues and not get arrested like they been doing to pastors there
since when the hell was non-binary ever accepted by God
its just another way in completely corrupting all morals and trying to teardown God. Im so exhausted with all the degenerate behavior being normalized.
satan
he s a failure  then.
john 3 17for God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world  but to save the world through him.
this does not bode well for the religion...
God does love variety  but to exercise all manner of perversions isn t what that means.
why not just start their own religion and church  why appropriate one they dont really believe or have faith in
I respect your faith and your freedom to believe in what ever you want to... but damn girl you get preachy sometimes.
edit I wrote this before finishing the video and it looks like you do understand and affirm the second and third points that Imade in my comment  but I am not going to delete this comment as the first part is still unclear based on what you said in the video.hello  melonie. just some points of clarification. you said that not all forms of sin are equal which is true  but you gave examples which do not follow what the Bible says concerning sin. based on what you said  itsounded as if you were claiming thatsexual immorality was a greater kind of sin than say lying or stealing. you showed 1 corinthians 6 9-10  kjv   where paul says   do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God  do not be deceived  neither the sexually immoral  nor idolaters  nor adulterers  nor men who submit to or perform homosexual acts  nor thieves  nor the greedy  nor drunkards  nor verbal abusers  nor swindlers  will inherit the kingdom of God.  paul lists homosexuality right alongside thieves  drunkards  and verbal abusers. the idea thatsexual sin is an abomination vastly greater than other sins is not in the Bible  but comes from paganized-Christianity  aka catholicism .all sin is separation from God s perfect will for us. you can sacrifice your salvation for any type of sin  things that most people deem as  trivial sins  like not honoring the sabbath. thankfully  all sin can be forgiven thanks to Jesus s sacrifice. the form of sin that is truly abominable according to the Bible is unrepentant sin. this is sin that a person continually engages in even when they know it is wrong. when Jesus forgave the adulteress  he commanded her to  go an sin no more . anyone actively living in sin will not attain salvation  but only those who are following Jesus and abiding by his command to flee from sin will inherit eternal life. we all sin and fall short of the glory of God  but if we are seeking to sin less then we are covered by Jesus s sacrifice. conversely  if a person seeks to sin more knowing they will ask forgiveness later or if they continue living in sin without ever seeking forgiveness  then they are on the path to the grave without the hope of resurrection.one last point on this topic. the Bible only mentions one unforgivable sin. this is the sin of denying God and his power to forgive sins. now  this doesnt mean turning away from God or having doubt. the reason this is in unforgivable is because the one who commits it never seeks forgiveness for it. if someone believes that God is not real  then why would they seek or receive his forgiveness  if someone believes that God wont forgive their sins  then likewise they also wont seek or receive forgiveness. the Bible makes is clear that God longs to see all of mankind saved by his grace  but he will not force anyone to turn to him against their own will. thus  anyone who is actively running away from God s forgiveness and salvation can never hope to have it. this makes such a sinner unforgivable.
like you  melonie  but this content ain t it for me.
nope!  that man or whatever  will not be in leading people to God. the Bible is clear what God thinks about people like that.  they will talked about as the least in the kingdom of heaven
no where in the Bible do the Bible writers say it was inspired by God
yea same I respect Christianity islam and my religion hindu but man some stuff seems cult shit lik increasing ur faith lik some exp points wont believing just be enough
oh  and as a side note  messing up one time would mean death if that person doesnt seek forgiveness from God and attempt to sin no more. I say death and not  going to burn for that   because it is more biblically accurate. the idea of eternal damnation and hellfire is not biblical  but rather another false teaching from paganized-Christianity  aka catholicism . the Bible says that  the wages of sin is death   not to be burned for eternity. the reward for salvation through Jesus Christ is the resurrection and subsequent eternal life  but the punishment for sin is to simple cease to exist. this is one thing that atheists accidentally got right  because since they dont believe in God or seek his salvation  when they die they will return to nothing. they are  of course  wrong when saying this is the fate of every person as those who follow Christ and live according to his commands will not suffer a true death of ceasing to exist  but will die in body and be resurrected and given eternal life. while the notion of monsters like hitler  stalin  and mao burning for eternity might sounds nice  it would be unjust to torment them forever for the evils of one lifetime or even 100 million lifetimes.
2 timothy 3 16  all scripture is given by inspiration of God  and is profitable for doctrine  for reproof  for correction  for instruction in righteousness  a 2 second google search would have shown you this  but alas lol
anyone who submits to man or elects a man to rule over them is disobedient to God  as made clear in genesis 3 5   for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof  then your eyes shall be opened  and ye shall be as Gods  knowing good and evil.   and exodus 20 3   thou shalt have no other Gods before me.  . we re all guilty of this  so long as remain citizens of nations under man... as made clear in matthew 6 24   no man can serve two masters  for either he will hate the one  and love the other  or else he will hold to the one  and despise the other. ye cannot serve God and mammon.  .
nonbinary priest  Im sorry that go s against God s  made in my own image and born for a reasion  its like they are saying no no no you got my creation all wrong. I get people want to be what they want to be but dont bring it into religion.
didn t genesis 1 27 sorta specifically state humanity s gender   not much about variety in  man  and  woman
its starting to sound like and forgive me if Im wrong. you might have stepped into sexual sin. not judging. but  thats what itsounds like
im not Christian so someone help me to understand. are yall mad because the person is non-binary specifically or can no one outside of some heterosexual be a church lead or pastor  im not joking or making fun. I am legit curious.
well God created the universe and the huge number of different species of life on planet earth but what is being discussed here are human social values which is very different to the creation of a very diverse planet earth
uk right now has its first ever non Christian pm a hindu look it up
what the hell os that
any struggling Christian s  just know and take comfort that youre at least not blasphemous fake one like this dude
idolatry in making God say whatever you want.
an actual spawn of satan
I heard  progressive Christianity .Im sorry  what is there to progress with it  its Christianity  it hasn t changed  and itshouldn t change.
God loves variety   if there is no degenerates or wicked ..besides that I guess God loves to go to the circus ...I dont know much about being Christian ... but Im a man of God... I believe in the living torah   your ancient testament   ... the prophets  our Lord yeshua  saviour of human souls .. I believe that the earth is a sacred garden  a living library for the ages to come  and this is a very crusial time in our history  .. but there is a battle going on...the serpent of the ancient lake... many fell in love with the serpents beauty  and thatserpent is extremely beatiful... the serpent is very patient  and a algorithmic wizard ...always wear the God s shield ... I know there many who knows how to use God s  s word ...
you say sacrilege but thats just how catholics roll
catholicism isn t Christianity anyway so there s that.
that isn t what God s word the holy Bible says
that is a demon. I used to make fun of God and Christianity because a demon seemed so impossible. but then you see things like this. willful abominations of humanity being praised.
God likes variety ... humanity is not a buffet  or some sort of trail mix. God created man and woman.
God does love variety  but he also created all those animals as male and female  so... this is insanity. the second coming cant happen soon enough.
adam and eve beg to differ
if you watch my entire video you ll see me talk about this very topic lol
@melonie mac go boom   I do apologize  sometimes I get over zealous and start typing while watching.
how strong can he be stronger than goku
I bet even he is disgusted
the trans anglican priest is a protestant lol
the chaplet of devine mercy.eternal father  I offer you the body and blood  soul and divinity of your dearly beloved son  our Lord Jesus Christ  in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world  for the sake of his sorrowful passion  have mercy on us. Jesus I trust in you! to see how catholics really roll I invite you to google relevant radio and check it out. the chaplet of devine mercy is a powerful prayer and I just prayed it for you. Jesus I trust in you! there is spiritual warfare going on in the catholic church of coarse there is just like with anywhere on earth. but Jesus said in matthew 16 18 to the first pope st peter that upon this rock I will build my church  and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
@yup y p  sounds like a cope.
@jean bethencourt  and when I say a virtue Im not speaking of the Christian virtue.
@yup y p  prots gotta hold that l. first trans  priest  honor is all yours.
@jean bethencourt  Im not anglican. Im just both better and more truthful person than you.
the church of england has become a mockery.
even biology agrees with that
no  God says its an abomination.
Im ok with anyone wanting to spread what they care about  but can we talk about the eyebrow liner  work.
deuteronomy 22 5 esv   359 helpful votes helpful not helpful a woman shall not wear a man s garment  nor shall a man put on a woman s cloak  for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God.
the word clearly states that God created male and female not a spectrum.
aren t tattoos a sin
how does this even make sense or religiously allowed like this kinda the opposite of the Bible kinda sacrilegious
Imust thank you for not playing the sound in the interview. I think it is ridiclous  and Im not Christian  Im pagan. you do know that your Christian God started off as one of the pagan Gods  yahweh  his followers were fanatics that did t want to accept that there were other pagan Gods  they preached non acceptance of others  the rest is history.
stop pretending youre superior while using modern Bible translations
could be the first furry priest for all I care. if youre gonna dictate how some religion should or shouldn t  be practiced youre waddling closer to fanaticism  same pattern of thought that have caused religious war and genocides throughout human history. that is much more worrisome to me. this  binary  person isn t even in the same country as you  he she it  whatever  is in the wokest country there is and you can only really expect it to escalate. you have no say in how they worship their God.edit  also  preaching against  desires of flesh  or whatever you d call it is straight out unhealthy. men need to ejaculate about 20 times a month to keep their prostate healthy. pleasuring yourself also help against depression and help us focus.
lake of fire means you cease to exist  eternal darkness  ecclesiastes 9 5 says the dead is not conscious of anything at all  .. so no hell  just nothing. what happens when you light a piece of paper on fire
melonie  I respect your belief. but as a person without a bone in the  fight . non binary people doesnt exist.. neither does God  Gods  budhas  allahs or religion in its entirety. you will not agree and I dont expect you to. we re all different.
so according to the Bible I am a sinner for being gay. its ok to to be gay but just should know its wrong and bad for me being gay and I am going to hell cause God created me this way. seriously they need to revamp the Bible especially the other abrahamic religon.
God created man and woman  surgery created trans.
is this hurting anyone in any no why are Christians  mad about this itshould ok if its not hurting any one and if people are offend with that non binary priest then all I can say is isn t this religion supposed to be about love and peace then why I want to get into the religion but people who are against gay rights like some of the really religious is why Im disgusted by this religion and forgive me but the the parts Ive read in the Bible was probably the worst thing Ive read in my entire life killing is a sin yet God killed billions of people in the Bible and the whole if you question me or are gay you are going to suffer for eternity what kind of God would allow this sorry for going on a tangent but I really poured my heart out on this please dont judge or attack me Im fine with religion just morally disagree with the whole heaven and hell thing and the hypocrisy of some of the people in the religion sorry
all religion is a business.  they are trying a different marketing technique.
please tell me youre not
so as an agnostic who rejects wokist garbage I am hated by both sides. maybe not by everyone on both sides but the world doesnt lovee just because I dont accept the Christian God argument. personally I have no idea if he exists and I really dont care. an all powerful God cannot be harmed and so sin cannot exist. a true  just  and all loving God would forgive any and all mistakes even if someone refuses to repent. hell doesnt have to exist  God can simply choose to make someone not exist after they die if he doesnt want them in heaven. after all that though  this woke shit really is grotesquealso all this unequally yolked shit is silly. Imean shit date who you want  but the fact is just because someone is a Christian doesnt mean they are better suited to someone. my ex fiance is Christian and we ended because of her mothers hatred for my political beliefs. she hates firearms and freedom and questioning the government. Im agnostic because I have no idea what happens after death and Im not narcissistic enough to claim I do. I just try to be the best person I can be. if God is real  he ll be more concerned about who I am
1 01 God s word is that women shouldn t teach. menstruation is abhorrent and divorce is sin. ask yourself  in his eyes  which one of the strange video subject  and yourself should be teaching should you be casting stones at lesser sinners  Ive just started the video and youre blaspheming about someone else s sin.
God isent real lol
dude  if a nonbinary person is Christian and wants to be a Christian I dont think itshould be called sacrilegious. damn  I dont know how to feel about you now.
nope  I talked about that in this video too. that verse is referencing a pagan scarification practice  not just tattoos. and the verse above it tells men not to cut their beard  it was ceremonial law specifically for the israelites at that time
God didn t create you that way. sin entered the world and we all have different struggles with different sin as a result  that is going to look different for everyone. its up to us to decide if we are going to give our lives to Christ and turn from sin  or if we will choose a lifestyle of sin over Christ. we have no excuses.
it is hurting people  this ideology will send people to hell
tip that fedora.
1-  an all powerful God cannot be harmed and so sin cannot exist that doesnt make sense 2- unequally yolked shit is silly  why  3-no but better chance than not
@m.j. vazquez  what is sin  it is violating Gods word and  harms  him. since we cannot harm God  nothing can be sin. sure we can harm each other and ourselves but God himself is unable to be hurt. because it is silly  to claim that people should ignore potential relationship partners simply for religious purposes is silly. Imay not be Christian but I am most definitely not one of those online atheists. hell  I live closer to what some people call a Christian lifestyle than the overwhelming number of Christians. when I was younger I had a crush on a girl who was Christian but she would only date other Christians. that poor girl went from relationship to relationship being cheated on  abused  and treated like shit but kept only chasing Christians. my ex fiance again a Christian and yet was more into this progressive shit than I could stomach with her mother and her being highly unable to handle an opinion outside their own. long story short  moral are more important than religions and dont pretend as if religion gives morals because the Bible definitely does has morals that harm others.  should focus on how someone acts  not which religion they subscribe too. I dont hate Christians  I actually respect and admire peoples personal relationship and ability to believe. but this idea that rejecting someone for not being a Christian and going after only Christians is silly. Imiss my ex fiance but again I lived closer to a Christian lifestyle than her and my beliefs fall closer.
@m.j. vazquez  I would rather just live my life to the best of my ability and not harm others  fight for freedom and find out when I die and if this God is real and just then he will judge me on that. otherwise what if you spend your whole life worshipping the wrong one
@m.j. vazquez  Imust respectfully end the conversation. as above  I am not going to sit here and explain my views while you keep trying to poke holes with bullet points. put together an actual paragraph that explains your idea or have a great life.
@drunkatheist  1- ok   but again whats wrong with bullet points  2-  put together an actual paragraph  yeah I do that enough for my college professors im not doing for a youtube comment
a sin is breaking God s law. God cannot be harmed by anyone physically  he can be harmed emotionally. he s our heavenly father  you can disappoint him.
@ieatpaste23  how are they his laws  who gets to interpret  those laws  no God has ever told me his laws yet I never murdered someone in his name.
@drunkatheist  its the law he himself follows  if he sins  he stops being God. he has told you  but you decided not to read the Bible. you know the 10 commandments  but reject them and say   God gave me no law!  you have been given a law  you have simply chosen not to look or hear.
@ieatpaste23  Ive read the Bible  Ive read about the condoning of murder  grape  slavery  torture in his name in the Bible. even if this book didn t have these glaring issues  Im not sure how some guys in the past who others have claimed did what they said the others said they did did it. exactly how confusing I just made it. how come you dont follow pagan Gods laws  why dont you go to your local priest and buy scrolls on how to pass the heart and feather scale  just because your book claims things does not make it real. this is the base of my argument. by all means believe in God  I actually am impressed and envy peoples ability to do so. but dont for a second think that just because you believe in God it makes you right and keeps you separate from the rest of us. hence why the unequally yolked thing is silly. I have known Christians who will cheat over and over and then say  God will forgive me. I dont believe in God and yet have never been unfaithful  even to those who were unfaithful to me. being a Christian does not give anyone the moral highground  its their actions that do.
@drunkatheist  Im not born again. simply believing wont do you any good. you can only be forgiven if you stop sinning. for those Christians who willfully sin they will find that the pagan and the atheist are all-forgiving
@ieatpaste23  but again who gets to determine sin  as long as you dont harm anyone else  then no hunan has the grounds to claim someone is sinful. now I haven t believed in hell since I was a child. it was quite easy to logically overcome it and if I did believe in God again then I could easily do so without thinking hell and sin are just man made ideas to easily control the minds of the easily gullible. again I have no issie with those who believe in God  but being a Christian gives you no more moral highground than being a muslim or wiccan.
@drunkatheist  Im mormon we believe those laws have always been  they are a part of nature the same way that gravity is a law  even our heavenly parents have to follow the celestial law. ultimately the point is to teach us to be like our heavenly parents. there also must be something about the nature of heaven that is harmful to lesser beings. if heaven  purgatory  and hell are all governed by their own law  then there must be something inherently harmful to the unworthy. so  judgment becomes necessary.
@drunkatheist  but souls are eternal and cant be destroyed. each of us have free will. if you use that free will for evil  then you have to be punished for doing so. the punishment is equal to the crime committed. also  know the only evil people go to hell  good and neutral people dont. Im not going to go into the whole mormon afterlife here. I have a virus  if I push certain letters my computer locks up.
@ieatpaste23  so God is all powerful and create souls and the universe but is unable to destroy them  again  you put your God in a box. I think everyone should just focus more on having a relationship with him if they believe in him then thats cool. I just reject the notion that believing in God gives anyone some sort of moral highground. its your actions that define you.
@drunkatheist  yes  now youre asking what saves you  works or faith . if its faith alone then God plays favorites. if its works a lone then there is no need for God. I reject the idea that God makes us. if he makes us  then we are made as we are. you cant have something like sin if you make everything with those qualities. can you blame a bomb when it explodes  thats its whole point. God becomes a God of favorites if he makes some that follow the commandments and others  he makes with the point of them not following the commandments. for mormons we believe our spirits were born the same ways we are on earth. then we developed our personalities and talents before we got here. it means we aren t creations  but children capable of growth. as well as doing right and wrong.
@ieatpaste23  that is an interesting way of looking at things  but I have to ask now then. if God didn t create us  then what gives him authority to command us
@drunkatheist  he s our father. I dont know how old you are but consider your own household. you had rules. you were given a curfew  and if you were going to be late you had to call. you had to do your homework  you had to treat your family right  and if you didn t you got grounded. its the same thing  with the same purpose- to teach you how be a good person. Im not asking you to be baptized. Im not asking you to have a strong testimony or become a religious scholar. Im just asking you to hope in the possibility that maybe it might be true. the alternative is believing earth is all there is. no loving heavenly parents who want you to come home to them. no after life. the knowledge that the death of a single bacteria is a tragedy  because it is gone forever. the loss of an entire species  an entire planet  is a catastrophe. also  the knowledge that your worth isn t what loving heavenly parents say it is  but what the world says it is. you and Imean nothing to the world. to the world if you aren t rich  powerful  and beautiful then you are nothing. as for unequally yoked as she calls it  its easier to understand if you move it to politics. a relationship isn t going to work if you date someone outside your political party. the Bible said it because it led the people away  and it does. Im saying it because it creates unnecessary problems in a relationship.
@ieatpaste23  it only creates problems in a relationship if you let it. I have a Christian friend who is marrying a non Christian. the two have been together for years and religion has never been an issue because they both respect each others beliefs and care more about the other person. again morals and values are far more important and have zero to do with religion. some of the worst people Ive known personally have been some of the most devout Christians.  this idea that you can only be a good person if you believe in Christ is flat out wrong and elitist thinking. because Im not sure if you knew this but your God is not the oldest God in recorded history. that would mean everyone would always be terrible all the time before he popped into existence.  also why does my worth have anything to do with what your God says it is  I create my own worth  my own value. Im not going to let anyone else tell me what I am worth. look dude you can give me logical fallacies all day and I can shred them. you want to believe in God  cool man I can respect that. but as stated above  dont for a second think that believing in God gives you any sort of highground because it doesnt.
@drunkatheist  I didn t say it did.
@ieatpaste23  actually you did  you claimed God needs to teach us to be a good person  which means you think anyone who rejects your God is by default not a good person which would give you the moral highground. look if you are going to make an argument then at least back it up. at least admit it and say  yes I do think Im better than people who dont believe in God because even if we all sin  at least I ask him for forgiveness  this back and forth Christianity is weaksauce my dude
@ieatpaste23  wow  and there it is. I never even challenged your belief in God but challenged this idea that Christians are some sort of moral highground simply because they believe in God. you ve proven exactly my point. I dont hate Christians  I hate when people try to pretend their God is their entire moral basis instead of who they are. its a piss poor argument and you just proved it. need to resort to insults. I appreciate the conversation  best of luck to you.
1. women shouldn t practice authority over men  but we are all called to share the word and evangelize  which I am doing2. during ceremonial law of the israelites  they were preparing for war and needed to be very strong. this is why some practices were put in place at thatspecific time for a specific people to avoid germs  like secluding the sick and not having intercourse during menstruation to avoid bacterial infection  etc 3. there are certain parameters for divorce that were permitted  mine fell within those. I recommend reading the word daily so you can further your understanding of it  and I am doing the same   I also encourage you to actually watch my video instead of taking me out of context. if you got throwing stones out of this  you definitely didn t watch the video.
@melonie mac go boom  and it was a good video 2
and you keep believing in the flaying spaghettImonster  friend
yes he is.
its odd that atheists cant stop trying to create more atheists  they dont want to be lonely in hell.
@jonathan devereaux  I feel really sad for you
even if you cant spell  tip that fedora!
