its amazing how amateur the writing on this show is. even if you forgive the lore-shattering changes they made  the story waffles between predictable cliches and mind bending-bendingly dumb events and character choices.
the scene where galadriel gave up her elf privilege and decided to become a tomb raider and explore caves and find lost artifacts was truly stunning and brave. some of tolkien s best work.
I dont think he s actually dead. the writers want to add him in later in a way that causes tension. after she hooks up with halbrand he ll come back. the writing is truly a masterclass on how to fail.
galadriel s husband  explained the same as a scene in an abbott and costello skit  where there is a psycho woman who then starts ranting about her  dead husband  and how he died and disappeared  etc..  at one point  costello exclaims   lady  he ain t dead  he s hiding!
I love the scene where galadreil held the american flag as she cried out   autobots! transform and roll out!  just before attacking the evil forces of cobra and skeletor.
its funny a few embers from the house blinds miriel  but the giant fiery ash cloud didn t harm her.
after seeing watching this train wreck of discourse and back-and-forth I went in and tried watching the first episode. I lasted about fifteen minutes. what broke me was this  when galadriel does her alley-oop parkour leap into the ice troll  there s this flash of some other elf s face his back on the floor  his face in some kind of enraptured awe as she sails over him. this was the same elf who helped her do the parkour  on his back in a joyous trance  like he didn t just help her do this three seconds earlier.barely two minutes later  the same elf who was so captivated at having his commander and Goddess leap over his face lays down his sword and leaves her. no dialogue  no hesitation . the naysayer elf gave the word and like robots every male elf ditched their badass commander--right after being literally on the ground awestruck by her skills. that was where I tapped out. these aren t tolkein s elves. they re a renaissance fair re-skin of j.j. abram s vulcans. youre a far stronger person than I am for choosing to endure this expensive nonsense.
wow  this episode looks like it was straight up painful to watch. guyladriel is so obnoxious that nobody wanted to save her from the lava  sounds about right  lol. great job persevering through this one melonie. also  blue is a great color for you
galadriel probably doesnt want to admit celeborn took out a restraining order against her.
dang - I was really cheering for the pyroclastic flow last episode to kill everyone.  disappointed that isn t the case.
I love how her unarmored face is sturdier than the houses beside her.  new elven power.
I cant believe the best actor in this episode was arguably isildur s grief-stricken horse. how the heck does that animal manage to convey more emotion in such little screen time than most other characters across 7 episodes
1. no one  even the great guyladriel  could have survived being in the path of a volcano blast.  2. no one  even the great guyladriel  could breathe in the ash aftermath of a volcano blast.
I loved the part where guyladriel said  its morfydd time!  and proceeded to gaslight  gatekeep  and girlboss all over middle earth. truly one of the series of all time...
elrond said  hey galadriel  have you ever been mistaken for a man   galadriel answered  no  have you   tolkien s work is just amazing  such dialogue!
I cant believe amazon gave them a season 2
this show is great at rushing through anything remotely exciting with no reaction or explanation  to spending the rest of the episode doing nothing until it ends where we thought it ended last time
say man flesh!   was literally saying the same thing
you should definitely do more videos like this. showing your reactions to these shows and movies you are watching and then giving us your thoughts and opinions on it afterwards.
I d say its something like wheel of time where they were mostly finished principle filming of 2nd season before they released to air  because they re such grand projects. I do have a feeling  that both shows will probably get finished due to the money spent already on them both  though they ll probably go down as abject failures by the general public whilst getting raved about by the critics  which will just show how little to trust said critics since they re so out of touch with the general populace these days. the real whack is that mount doom erupts basically at the end of the 2nd age  like nearly 2000 years after the rings were forged. so not only was galadrial wandering around with celebor  she d birthed her daughter 3000 years prior and doesnt even mention her at all  o
its called getting the job because of your political ideology rather than skill and talent.
its baffling. there are children s cartoon shows that are more well conceived and written.
the willing suspension of disbelief is strong with this one hey....
its amateur writing because the writers kept having their work denied for the past 10 years. this was their first actual job  having no proven experience and only got the job because jj abrams vouched for them.
@anovaguy  reminds me of a quote that went something like   a children s story that can only be enjoyed by children is a bad children s story. no matter  who its for   all stories deserve a modicum of thoughtfulness be put into them - which modern  production   rehashes  lack in spades.
@anovaguy  by a long way too!!
if only they did a show like that!
hahaha
this exactly. celeborn being  dead  is just another mystery box  and so galadriel can do whatever they need her to until celeborn inevitably returns.
melonie mac got it right when she said he probably ran away. actually  celeborn took a  lost weekend  because he was growing weary of living with someone who is always right. they ll find him in a hundred years or so  smoking poppies in some field in edoras  and after a stint in rehab  he will be perfectly fine in time for the jackson movies.
thats some days of our lives twist  and Im quite positive youre right.
what a cheap twist  totally on brand for these writers though.
@k matsu   we ll find out that elves are born as fully grown adults so that galadriel   celeborn s daughter can be born and marry elrond to give birth to an adult arwen just in time for fellowship.
@singbrotherheckler  yes ... they read som of the comments from tolkien fans  questioning where he was ... I wish they would read them all.
head canon  he s in the witness protection program...........           permanently.
so he is  lost in action  and then he will be back  ok.    but if that is so why she went for centuries long search for sauron and not spend even the same amount of time searching for her husband   d I know that in the book she returned from lorien to rivendell to be with celeborn again as he at first did not want to go to lorien with her  becouse he didnt want to travel through moria - never was dwarven friend that one . but he was ok  not lost in battle or anything just living in other place for some years - which is nothing for an elf.
he s totally alive  they are doing thatsilly  I think they re dead and then they aren t  trope  which they did with bronwyn and isildur. super odd to bring up her missing husband in episode 7. most people would have moved heaven and earth to avenge their husband or wife being killed instead of their brother. unless her husband was a bad person  it makes no sense that he is such an afterthought.
@thad lozensky  I think he comes back in the next season as a super badguy.  he s seen in the background in a disguise  putting tacks in chairs  tripping waiters  and spitting in baby formula.
keep skeletor out of thishe s a respected member of our country club
we are here. we are waiting...
didn t even mess up her makeup
and because we have no confirmation of how many people were in the village  they can keep showing that dozens of them die each time and still be 40 50 on screen
its an exercise in patience to watch this show. you have to forget about everything tolkien and anything well-written to enjoy this. I tried being impartial and forgetting any lore I knew  still caught myself audibly confounded at just about every turn. the harfoots are the hardest to sit through.
lol episode one is the least of this garbage
I did better than you - managed 36 minutes of the first in two tries! mind you  I was drinking white rum during all of it.
@jco2002  does this rum have a name  for research purposes
@sarb nitrof  yep  its called rum bar made by worthy park in lluidas vale  st catherine  63  alcohol  but I dont know if you can get it outside of jamaica where I live. I should mention that I was also smoking a spliff  which is legal here in your own yard. but still  I only lasted 36 minutes total. the first try was 31 minutes  and then I was nodding off and said f  k this. next evening tried again and only lasted 5 minutes more  also drinking white rum.
@jco2002  I need to science this.
@sarb nitrof  good idea. sounds like a plan.
nonsense! you just dont understand that the elves in rop are obviously bi-polar and switch moods at the drop of a hat or sword in this case
Ive read lotr in 2 languages and the silmarillion in one. even the short clips in a review make me not want to ever see this show. everyone who even started watching is stronger than I am. but I really dont mind. not even a bit.
guyladriel  lol
remember  saurguyladriel is not a woman  a woman is human  saurguyladriel is an elf  an elf female  thus she must be declared she-elf or strong female  get it right people....
I would ve left her there. Imean the elves already tried to yeet her off to valinor. its funny because the show seems to be trying to position her as the protagonist that we re supposed to root for  but every other character in the show around her seems to be very much aware of how insufferable and unlikable she is.
truly celeborn s a wise man.
she got that feature when she reached level 50  along with the  summon elven armor  spell.
super-heated air alone is 1 170 degrees celsius  2 140 degrees fahrenheit . pyroclastic resilience indeed.
elves do not breathe so...
they literally show people dead not 10 feet from her. but nah  she s completely unharmed.
@marisbury animusphere  that makes sense.  now I can see how she swims oceans with the greatest of ease.
just think. in the 1st age thousands of real noldor warriors were killed by similar volcanic eruptions in the battle of sudden flame. if there s a special reason this didn t kill galadriel  it needed to be a better explanation than simply  plot armor
@marisbury animusphere  what  where does it even suggest such a thing
@corepathway  also elves dont have reflections or shadows tooI read thatsomewhere  has to be tolkien  Im sure of it
@user.equalto.null  elves are incarnated souls basically
@thedeadlyknight  yes along with the human main characters who were also unscathed.
and also   saurguyladriel is not a woman  a woman is human  saurguyladriel is an elf  an elf female  thus she must be declared she-elf or strong female  get it right people....
and then she fell asleep on the dropship while elrond bragged about all the weapons they had at their disposal
ahh I should watch alien.
they have to  if they dont its admitting the critics was right and amazon will never allow that.
I think its a contractual reason  they may shake things up tho
they already shot 3 seasons.
they guaranteed 5. still dont think they will make it.
what do you mean gave  them    its an amazon project  amazon money  amazon studios. they re just continuing what they started after spending a truck load of money.
its so bad that its actually funny. reviews are hilarious!!!
I can. failing upward has been the norm.
they ve already booked the tax write-offs by quarter with the uk tax authorities and base-shifitng marks for the irs. they started filming s.2 in the new uk studios last week. it would be harder to unwind the tax treatment forwards for the next fy than stop  or start over.
I think they said season 2 started to film this week. a few days ago  they have the money to blow so I guess they might as well.
dont expect a season 3.
amazon gave them a season 2 because enough people watch it. I like rings of power and so do many other people. it would make zero sense to make a 2 season of a show people hate. it just goes to show that the conservatives and libertarians review bombing the show were nothing more than whiny petulant children who behave like the left wing democrat twitter sjws they claim to hate. you canthank youtubers like melanie  geeks   gamers  nerdrotic  the quartering and disparu that gave rings of power a 2 season by hate watching the show.
@sebastian suarez  amazon gave them a second season because they signed 5  so they had to. they are not  hate watching  anything  they are having the time of their lives  while making money  laughing their asses off at this ridiculous show... do you seriously think that lines like   the sea is always right  is good writing  if you like tolkien you just cant like a trash like rop.
@aster4jaden  the issue I have is people attempting to blame woke for terrible show writting coming out of america atm  like the last season of game of thrones.
@alf gui  incorrect  amazon wouldn t even consider giving them a second season if the show is as bad as conservatives and libertarians claim it is.  youtubers like melanie goes boom  nerdrotic  geeks and gamers  the quartering  josiah rises and disparu are hate watching it because they are watching the show despite claiming how much they hate it. if they had even the smallest amount of common sense  they would have stopped watching the show after the first episode. in this case common sense is as simple as  if you dont like it  dont watch it  because no one is forcing them to watch it. but they dont do it because there is profit to be made out of outrage when it comes to youtube content creating. last but not least  let s not play the game of nitpicking corny one liners since there are plenty of movies and shows that have worse lines than  the sea is always right . also  you can like rings of power despite liking tolkien s work  its called having an opinion and not being a mindless sheep that both extremes  conservatives and sjws  want you to be.
@alf gui  also trash is subjective since its based on perception. for me  trash is andor  she hulk  most of the marvel movies and the star wars sequels. one man s trash is another man s treasure. and while it is not perfect  itstill is less political and less agenda driven than shows like andor and house of dragon  despite the hyperbole made by conservative and libertarian youtubers.
@sebastian suarez  nope  deals so important like this one dont work like that  they signed 5 seasons and have already invested a ton of money  they may reduce the competences of people in charge and cut costs while attacking tolkien fans calling us racist and sexist  good luck with that  to justify the debacle  that is not going to change the fact that they created one of the most embarrassingly bad shows ever considering the investment made.rop is so comically terrible than even the guardian dedicated a piece basically saying it was thrash  so please  stop with the political excuses.
based!!!!

the apple storyline is the most exciting  the apple that isildur threw into the sea  returned as the king apple  to join all the other apples that magically grew  only then to be burned by eminem.
why didn t guyladriel just attack the orcs   they couldn t be harder to beat than an  ice troll   could they   or is her sword a troll slayer sword with triple damage vs. ice trolls like the dragon slayer swords in ad d   why didn t her elven blade glow in the presence on orcs like orcrist  glamdring  and sting   was that only for blades forged in gondolin   and why oh why didn t they make the show about the city of gondolin   that would have been interesting!
when you watch stuff when skipping   its already a indicator its bad. there are only 24 hours in a day Im glad you watch it for us so we dont have to    keep making this content its comfy.
Im pretty sure the galadriel and theo scene about celeborn was a reshoot. that is why they are mysteriously separated  from everyone all a sudden. everyone was asking about celeborn  so they added thatscene.
they really acknowledged her husband  only to have him killed off screen  are they going to super secret twist conjure her daughter so elrond doesnt have to marry whatever child she and not saroun have  cause that would be super creepy
my friend told me that they f ud up galadriel s backstory because she said her husband celeborn died alongside her brother against morgoth. where as in the lotr s movies  he s alive. so they re not connected
missed opportunity!  for this trash show  yep  itsure was!! love the reactions  youre helping me feel better about this farce!
I really struggled to watch this episode   after I watched all episodes of arcanes 1st season in a row. arcane was awesome. awesome story! awesome characters! dramatic as hell! what an awesome introduction of characters and story development. and then there is this abomination   took me almost an hour to get myself ready and every time when you think it cant get any dumber  it does.
your reaction at 02 52 says it all. we love you  melonie! take care   be safe.
how are you going to tell someone to get back  then proceed to tackle that person towards danger
if I recall the rights deal came with a 5 season commitment  so its already been automatically renewed through season 5. they would have to pull some batgirl level stunt to burn what they already paid for just to stop the bleeding.
when galadriel goes  its galadriel-in time!  and both smites all the orcs while also swaying sauron to the side of good and they fall in love  that was pure tolkein writing
if anything  I was wondering how it was already that bad at episode 1
also galardiel only found one survivor from the dust. everyone else rescued the rest of the village s survivors and got out of there and build a camp. galadriel found one kid and thought  no need to search any other survivors  we ll just leave now
that looked painful.  it is a shame that you experienced the abomination that is the rings of power.  I have not watched one lick of it  and never will as I have too much respect for j.r. r. tolkien and his literature to have my eyes polluted with bezos  pet project.  I just recently discovered your channel ms. melonie and I appreciate your honesty and good sense  so I subscribed.  looking forward to watching many more of your vids.  by the way  did amazon steal a clip of peter jackson s depiction of a balrog   that profile looked so familiar.
amazon   the sea is always right fans   the customer is always right
Im glad you had the same reaction I did to the orcs smelling something on their patrol   man flesh!
the whole thing about galadriel going back to valenor and then jumping out ot the boat doesnt make sense she was denied being able to travel west until she passed the test with the one ring.
dont feel sorry for me  feel sorry for them  cause they about to get it.  lol  youre delivery makes me want you to dub an abridged series of this show so we can get something more entertaining out of it!
and how did galadriel live  and yet celeborn did not  so wise a elf as he was  and only cringes to withstand him  galadriel flushed and forgot her karen.  the wisest elf may be slain by one cringe   she said   but celeborn was pierced by many.
hey  dont give them ideas. I want my memory of lotr stay intact and separated from this stinking bs
and dont ask questions  to be able to answer a question mean they have to have thought process  meaning at least two braincells to transfer signal back and forth. I dont think they re that capable
@duy son  I thought it took more than 2 brain cells to process thoughts but whom am I to question youIm sure youre some kind of braincell specialist. lol
the only way elrond will marry guyladriel s daughter is if they cast blaire white to play her
at last  we can call this for what it is non-canon  poorly-written fan-fiction!
@ insert clever name here   wasn t that obvious after mithril story and elendil and celebrimbor being alive at the same time
alternate timeline. the timeline of garbage.
much rather arcane over rings of power lol
@daniel n  one billion
probably because its made by the same clueless people  d
yes! when galadriel walks out together with theo from thatscene  you can hear injured people moaning  screaming and calling out all around them. but she just walks away.
@alelima  she walks by a horse on fire  didnt save it  also an old man on fire  didnt help him lol
@main source  the things they do on this show are so weird. like already commented in this video  thatscene in this very same episode with the falling branch from the tree meteor man tries to heal. norI pushes the other harfoot right under the falling branch  instead of pulling her back  away from the falling branch.or episode 3  when the elves fight the warg and the female elf in the beginning of the fight picks up a spear. instead of piercing the warg with thatspear from a distance  she just holds the spear and runs towards the warg  bumping right into it and letting it kill her instantly.
the lore has been so badly beaten and mis-shapened that this is the least of the offensive lore breaking elements
lore has left the chat since episode 1 unfortunately
I like how she was constantly talking about revenge for her brother s death... even in this scene it was  yeah  oh  by the way  I had a husband... he was an idiot though because he couldn t even put his armor on correctly.  no wonder he bit the dust...
thats me when I look at butter   I barked a laugh at that
your dialogue is better than the show.
hopefully the next season of wheel of time will be good. only thing that will save fantasy adaptations now is first law or malazan
its kind of unimaginable that you call the durin  elrond conversations  boring  to go back to  galadriel    theo ... pretty much unique  I can say that.
this show was made for everyone! the story is perfect for 5-10 year old  the effects amazing for 10-30 years and the landscape magical for 30-90 years
03 07galadriel spends time looking for sauron   1000 yearsgaladriel spends time looking for her missing husband  0 years
the writers were apparently writing in a vacuum. no reference to their own material from prior episodes. everything about this mess is an epic....mess. years from now this should be a case study in film school of how not to make a series.  what makes this even worse  if that is possible  is we have hotd as a comparison study in how to write  direct and produce a good series.
I thought this show was a tragedy  but now I realize its a comedy!
one more thing  when they showed the landscape shot in this episode with the words  the southlands  changing to  mordor  I realized how dumb they think their audience is. since this show is about as subtle as a sack of bricks to the face  I bet halbrand really is sauron  now.
some of those outfits look like halloween costumes made by the parents of kids before they go out trick or treating. some of that  armor  is particularly humorous  that plate and scale armor looks like the quilted pattern in an oven mitt.
your play-by-play voiceover was more entertaining than the show lol
I want to watch a full episode with melonie. fantastic.
1 57 theo just strolling through volcanic ash.  when your actor doesnt understand green screen or where they would be
its amazing. I am glad I am not watching this show. its so badly written I couldn t handle it. however  I really enjoy reactions to it! I like yours especially  so I ll watch more.
I was pissed off about this series being made but now Im loving the reaction. some of it is funny as fuck! more power to you  keep it going!
Ive never seen any Lord of the rings stuff  but Ive watched every single minute of this disaster with various yters and its been a billion times more entertaining than the schlock they re reviewing. its such a weird time to be alive. literally everything in popular culture is untethered from reality  and I think we re on the cusp of either a cultural renaissance or a total societal collapse. time will tell.
I have tried watching ep 5 to 7 at different times of the day or night.. every single time I have fallen asleep.
I know this is off topic but has she done a video on all her tomb raider stuff she has so many figures in the back and  Im always curious whenever I watch her videos and I cant find any video on them.the life size lara in the back is so cool
knock knock-who s there galadriel-galadriel who galadriel dont have to watch rings of power
but the camera panned in slow motion  so cinematic.
I haven t done that yet but good idea  d
the flaming horse is already my fav new character.
btw been meaning to tell you mel  love the  less  eye make up you have been doing lately    love the natural look!
the announcement of season 2 is just they desperate to make us think that the show didnt flop at the numbers
those pyroclastic flows sure are selective in middle earth. all that fire  smoldering embers floating around while people walk through them  ash and smoke  flaming horses  hahaha! . and no explanation whatsoever how anybody survived it and are still breathing in all of it.
still wondering where celeborn and celebrian are. at this point in the lotr lore  galadriel is married and has her daughter  who will marry elrond.
I thought the orc was going to say manflesh as well. I guess my expectations were subverted.
this is literally the most of this show I will ever see
she pushed her under the limb  lol I noticed that and it had me confused...
if I was a large shareholder of amazon or a board member ... I would definitely raise a question about if it isn t better to cancel season 2  3 and 4.
they should just have an alternative audio on each episode with just your narration.
I love that everyone s reactions to the harfoots is the same
I dont even know what to really say at this point. I thought the rest of the plot was bad so far but this takes the cake now. galadriel spent exactly how long chasing after this evil and yet just abandoned her own husband with out actually trying to confirm his death. spoiler  we know he cant be dead since they dont have the rights to do that. thats also no never mind to the asking a man stabbed in the chest bleeding out slowly to then just get up and ride off with them all while doing so under his own power. bruh  canthey get anything in the writing right  I swear these people dont even review their own writing to keep track of the plot they ve written.
okay  they re in the woods. the camera keeps on moving. uh  I think they re looking for some witch or something. I dont know  I wasn t listening. nothing s happening. nothing s happening. something about a map. nothing s happening. its over. a lot of people in the audience look pissed.
amazon s take on mithril is one of the dumbest fan fiction ideas in the series. thanks for suffering through this because there s no way I could!
missed opportunity!   100
how did this show got a season 2 permitted but the other amazon show paper girls didn t and it was actually really good
good God! you are gorgeous  !!!!!  glad I found your channel now I can suffer a little less  through rings of power  through your reactions  subbed
forever to be remembered  or forgotten  as the cheeto episode.
my wife and I do want to thank the series for making me appreciate the hobbit movies more.
this might come off creepy but its not meant to be  Im liking the no minimal make up look  I think it fits your personality better.

I think thats the one thing I hate more than the blood sword key unlocking the mordor playset.
thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  your welcome  its always nice stumbling across an influencer that is Christian conservative  isnt afraid to put woke culture in its place   yet still has a positive funny attitude. I love nerdrotic and the critical drinker but sometimes they can be overly critical and angry joe still hasnt been red pilled lol. although hes coming around. tyrone magnus is another one whom youremind me of in that respect. keep up the great work!!
2 15 the real question is how do they all still live while the village is destroyed  burnt to a crisp and there are incinerated corpses all around her...
are they even legally allowed to use the same visuals of the balrog from the film  Imean they are owned by different companies  they literally tried to get peter jacksons help and then quickly ghosted him because they had to distance themselves from the film. I feel like this might land them in copyright territory.
it feels like the story didnt even start yet
rings of power is my  show to fall asleep on  when I need to go to bed.
I love how the newly formed mount doom erupted cheeto dust!
norI s dad  our race is always united we always help each other ...............  a few chapters back . his friends left him and his family behind without helping them.hahahahaa halbrand is in bed for a wound and needs elven medicine..... a minute later riding. hahaha
evil has come to the cheetos factory. granted the trilogy was about the people walking to a volcano but damn at least they kept moving. its like playing dnd and the dm just wants to tell you about his her trip to the mall.
the fact that isildur was perfectly fine  and the minute after he s supposed to be dead. wtf    how tf could they lost him  or put him away with 0 explanation   did the queen killed him r something . it makes no sense at all
I bet season two start with tom bombadil waking up and realising bobby ewing is still alive and season one was all just a dream.
this series of reactions reviews youre doing - imma just say it - is very much like ace trainer liam s wtf moments in pokemon episodes series  except this is better  your series of reviews  that is .
what a thorough review xd.
4 41 rings of power creators   see  the flaming horse coming towards galadriel is just like that white horse coming towards arya stark in game of thrones s8... its like poetry  they rhyme...
does anyone even cough during this episode while you know walking around with fresh volcanic ash  fire  and lots of smoke  o.o
oh! hello beautiful natural eyes!!  as much as I like your style in makeup  this is the first time Ive seen you without it and I love it! looking good melonie mac! edit  I thank you very much for always being nice on the eyes for me!
so wait. celeborn is gonna come back   tame wild filly galadriel enough to put a baby in her  do they realize how impossible that appears to viewers of this show   no way would a chik behaving this way  be willing to become a mother
Ive seen mt st. helen s erupt. sorry with mt doom waking and erupting from that range there would be no survivors and the landscape would have been wiped out for many  many miles.
this stuff needed storyboards and good writers sigh
I actually fast forward through the half foot scenes  Ive never watched a show before where the boredom has been so unbearable that I felt the need to actively skip certain scenes involving a certain group in a tv show.
so  unless celeborn is just randomly revealed to not be dead in a later season  then that would make rings of power officially non-canon to the peter hackson movies  right since not only would that erase arwen from the timeline  since galadriel and celeborn s daughter is elrond s wife and arwen s mother  but because celeborn was alive in the Lord of the rings movies!!!
the village is incinerated but none of the main characters even have a burnt hair on the heads. remarkable.
its not just the peter jackson movies  the written canon from tolkiens books also has celebron. this series is just woke fan fiction.
@sanjay sanj  the biggest reason I bring up the movies is because they seem desperate to bring in people who watched the movies but never actually read tolkien s works  I am technically in that category ...
Imean it is non-canon. celebrimbor died 2000 years ago before elendil. thats clear in the canon.
I felt like they wanted to do a 9 11 scene. like how people didn t know where any of there loved ones were  and there was dust everywhere. that was my interpretation of what was going on.  only thing I could come up with.   apparently the method of story telling that they are employing is just trying to hit punch lines. its like the nock nock   who s there  betcha didn t see that coming. and your like what  what didn t I see. and their like a person should not dwell on what is not known  it hollows the mind. and your like no  I just... and they re like balrog.
Ive never watched the show. seems like a good time
I swear if they get to season 2 and they re already in the middle of just making all the rings and saying thatsauron had already went around to all the realms and did his deceiving to forge the rings all off screen imma flip tf out.
they missed an opportunity with galadriel. she could have been the a great character to unite the people against the evil  but who wants to follow anybody so angry an emotional . I found your channel and found it refreshing to have a young woman defend men. thank you and please continue your unbiased reviews.
I have the feeling that payne and mckay wake up every morning  telling each other how great they are  that all their ideas are golden and anyone that disagrees is patently evil. payne and mckay are no talent hacks who s egos are only eclipsed by their hubris.
damn 3 40 melonie   I recently finished talion s story of shadow of mordor and shadow of war coz this show left me in deep void of ruination for lotr material..     yea man-filth man-flesh is always tht best energy I get to kill an orc which spots me being sneaky xd   its just pure joy to hear.. I can relate to tht xd
these reviews make me feel like Im missing nothing by not watching rop.
ah  but you dont understand! this was galadriel s  pivotal  moment  the destruction of the village and the aftermath has wisened her up now  therefore she is now the paradigm of virtue and humility  cant you see that !  that is how the showrunners are treating it .secondly  theo is feeling guilty and its his fault  but in actual fact discount legolas  er  Imean arondir  took the sword away from him and took responsibility for hiding it. it was out of theo s hands. arondir was the one who did a sh tty job hiding it! arondir could travel from the tower to town in just a few minutes  he could ve easily snuck back up there and threw the thing into the center of the lake  for good irony  and no-one would have ever found it. but everyone in this show is incompetent. a true reflection of the writer  maybe
highlight of this episode was the gfuel heyo
I love watching your reviews on lotr I cant watch thatstuff anymore after a while you start to feel like youre being mentally assaulted they should use lotr to interrogate prisoners in gitmo
nice one  melonie! you demonstrate just how easy it is  with just a little critical application  how many yawning great plot-holes   inconsistencies there are in this episode. its all a bit of a shambles  looking over the series altogether  and a tedious  snooze-fest  for much of the time  as you say.
waitso celeborns dead  so why is he standing next to galadriel in the fellowship of the ring saying  where is gandalf for I would much like to talk to him   also how is celeborn dead when he s arwen s grandfather  ya know arwen the 2700yr old daughter of elrond and celeborn s daughter celebrian. celeborn whom sailed west to the undying lands at the beginning of the 4th age... some 5000yrs from the middle of the 2nd age... good grief this series sucks and is pissing on the lore of the Lord of rings!
if you havn t watched it yet  can you do a reaction series for the show arcane on netflix  its probably the best show ever made!
celeborn prob faked his death to get away from galadriel
I dont know if anyone has survived a pyroclastic flow before bet the people in pompeiI wish they knew that trick.
thanks for making it easy for me to not watch rings of power. btw  are you doing something different with your makeup  looks good!
I watched  all of it. not because I enjoy it or give a f ck. but because I want to study it and tell them all friends of mine that this show is  hit and here s why.
it is hard to understand how the people that were less than 10 feet apart survived the pyroclastic flow. however  itseems that just the  cannon fodder   died.  although  guy-ladriel  says she has lost her husband celeborn during a war  there are some spoilers from the series saying celeborn will be on season 2. I hope it is true  because if he is really dead  I swear I ll stop trying to watch that fan-fiction soap opera that I keep hoping gets better and so far it has not.
this show has done the impossible  its united the internet
when you pour your foundation on sand  it doesnt matter what kind of house you build on top of it.
itshows how disconnected this series is from tolkien s work  and is further evidence as to why itshould be considered nothing short of an attempted butchering of his writings! I will not even deem to call it what many have called it in this comment section  a fan-fiction. there s nothing  fan-fiction  about this monstrous and abhorrent atrocity of a show that is such a corruption of what was originally written  even morgoth would be shocked by what the writers and producers have created! and the truly infuriating thing to me is that  in spite of how many times people keep saying they want it to fail  and how much they plan not to watch it  they watch it anyway because  it might get better!  horse shit! they have no intentions of doing better  and know what they re doing! and the only way to get that message through that we want no part in their crap is to carry out a universal boycott on this show!
love thatshow. amazing voice and sound editing
cant blame him
thank you  yes I am wearing less makeup lately
many trolls dont understand that a lot of their reasons never mattered. even if it was a mediocre show and worse  it was simply not about their reasons. and it is just almost unimaginable that the showrunners would waste the whole first season without showing relevant  or titular  plot points... that is what the increasing criticism of many is about.
they rolled under the tree because the director was apparently taking a nap.
I wouldn t be surprised to find out that this show was written by ai.
Imust go...  why   I dont know.... gripping...
if you watch lotr   she hulk on a splitscreen  your brain will literally melt. dont do it
I dont get it why galadriel just do not kill that bunch of orcs. she just slain ice troll like no problem at all.  if they wanted galadriel to become powerful  why not just become consistent
this really makes me wonder how many people hate watch shows.
6 14 -  ...stand back... 6 24 -  ...stand back... in the middle of my room  I did not hear from you. 7 05 -  ...go your own way... you can call it a-nother lonely day.  have you been  perchance  listening to some fleetwood mac  technically  the former is from stevie nicks  solo career  but fm played it when they toured  so it would be included in videos of their live performances.I ll shut up now.
my sister is in danger .... I shall tackle her so she cant get away from it ...... harfoots  harfeet   really are a savage breed
the criticism for these shows are the only thing that is keeping them alive
the harfoot writers are consistently stupid.gandalf saves them from the wolves but hurts his arm  so they all like him.gandalf tries to heal his arm. it might be working  so norI touches him and a weird thing happens but she s ok  so they all hate him for what norI did.gandalf tries to fix the burned tree and they all stand there super close  then norI puts herself and a kid in danger but they re both ok  so they all hate him more for what norI did.gandalf is banished for what norI did but after he s gone the trees all magically grow back  so they send a search party to find him because they all like him again.I think the smartest thing he can do is hide from them. stay away. and definitely dont let norI get within 500 feet of him.
the story was found in hidden trashcans from tolkien
points for staying awake  though it looked close for a minuet there.

pyroclastic flow is barely an inconvenience   a pyroclastic flow  also known as a pyroclastic density current or a pyroclastic cloud  1  is a fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter  collectively known as tephra  that flows along the ground away from a volcano at average speeds of 100 km h  30 m s  but is capable of reaching speeds up to 700 km h  190 m s . 2  the gases and tephra can reach temperatures of about 1 000  c  1 800  f .
you are addictive  I cant stop watching you. adorable
prepare for episode 8  cliffhanger bonanza
with the whole deal about modern sensibilities  Im shocked its  husband  and not  wife .
12 41holly cow... I was watching this  and my dogs ran and barked just before you said  even the dogs are like  what s going on ... I lost my mind for a second.
there s some visual interest  but the blindness was pointless  setting up theo was clumsy  unless he gets killed playing soldier   the dialogue was distracting  and itsounded like they were setting up some horse-rider magic bond for next episode. they ve kept some goofy touches that were present in lotr  overly idealistic friendships  adventures with hobbits   but they need stronger storytelling. I felt like I was missing something - how is the dead husband an afterthought  Im trying. if they lacked grace in execution  I could still like any big ideas. but as noted  the philosophical stuff from galadriel just feels scattered - like the writers weren t on the same page. gandalf could drop wise advice. galadriel was going full dark side a few hours earlier.
not if they fed the aI the books
aye  I stopped watching the show after episode 4. that was it  I couldn t do more.
bahhhh spooky
most episodes of scooby do have more convincing plot twists than this.
amazing episode
you when you look at butter. wow this is a riveting show...not!!!! yeah he ran away from her. was the flame from the volcano  did you say the son s name is bingo  big hearts  small brains. from you  melonie  and others I watch  yall are more entertaining then any of this show. thank you for putting up with this show to entertain us. love the hoodie  you look beautiful. great video melonie. until the next video!
no idea how I was recommended your channel lolz but it has just been the bees knees
she literally  according to the framing of the shots  pushed that other girl right under the tree.  absolute idiocy.
Im mad at the volcano for not ending femenazriel.
new video! let s go!!!!!
well you will have to wait about another year to get the sleep inducer again  so you ll need to rely on meds lol
there is no way I could sit through that
its like the writers are having a competition on who can make up the dumbest things each episode. it just keeps getting worse
melonie I love your new look !
2 18 exactly! I thought Imissed something  but it was amazon who missed something  logic.
so grumpiel has a husband  I feel bad for the guy for having to tolerate her shit on a daily basis
how did they get separated   who knows.  what I want to know is how they have hair left.  once my hamster jumped out of my hand onto the stove and his cute little wiskers went poof as he ran by the burner that was on.  they should be bald!
crazy how all those people could casually breathe the air filled with volcanic ash. you cannot make this up.
they had to spent so much money on the licence  there was no budget left for decent writers  d
the main reason why its so bad in my opinion is that the creators dont want to remember or are totally incapable of remembering what they ve set up in previous episodes and at times dont even seem to remember what they ve set up just minutes before in the same episode. things happen because they need them to happen  people say totally opposite things to what they ve said before  they treat the audience as total idiots and pretty much everything is a self-insert or a modern sjw  problem  awkwardly written into a world that has nothing to do with reality  nd plays out hundreds of years before sjw s and their  problems  were even a thing.
I think youre a little harsh on the harfoots for being upset about everything they have in the world being burned. but  other than that  youre spot on. I think the best two characters we have so far are disa and adar. everyone else is so bland and not interesting.one thing I noticed yesterday while listening to yt channel  listening in   during the balrog scene  ian mckellen is speaking on the bridge of khazad dum. he s saying  paraphrased   I am a wielder of the secret fire  the flame of arnor  darkness shall not avail you...flame of udun.  as he says this  his voice falters. we see him be both powerful with his spells  but also  maybe almost  maybe not  afraid  and vulnerable. its a beautiful moment. this show cant create moments like that because everything is so wooden. Imean  thinking back to aragorn  the king of the west  a powerful warrior  and good man  falls down  gets knocked down  has moments where he s about to die  but its scrappy. he gets help from his friends. his clothing is pretty ragged. and  yet he s a powerful force in battle. in rings of power  galadriel  literally looks directly into the volcanic ash that blasts over buildings and burns horses  that no one apparently cares about   and the worst thing that happens to her...she gets knocked over and a little ash lands on her. its just not believable. if buildings are getting toppled  then she should at least run for cover or something.oh  and bear mccreary s music is completely forgettable. I wasn t really impressed with howard shore s intro theme either.
first she touches magic ice and now this
ashes and flames from a volcano at a thousand degrees hit them directly and not 1 hair is burned. this show is unbelievable. elves can die from arrow wounds  axe wounds  sword wounds  but not from fire apparently.
that really took me by surprise
well  harfoots are evil little buggers.....
the harfoots are evil.
so . what if rings of power s viewership is actually just youtubers watching itso we dont have to
melonie... the first question should be  why are they even still alive
okay  this is a bit weird to say  but after watching you watch this show  I just want to watch you exist. I had to re-wind just to see what parts you were reacting to because your reactions were so much more enjoyable than this atrocious show.
volcanic ash is not light like that of ash from fire. it is rock  dense and heavy. immediately following eruption  it is hot and caustic. yet in this portrayal  hair is not even singed.  not a very realistic portrayal.
andrew klaven s favorite line from as good as it gets is hollywood s motto now   woman  how do you write such compelling women jack nicolson  I think of a man  then I take away all reason and responsibility.
how do none of them have trouble breathing in all that volcanic ash
you have become my favorite youtuber. the ending music is stuck in my head what is the name of the original song
wait..sugar free gummy bears  !  your bathroom in a few hours is going to look and sound indistinguishable from the set of rings of power
calaborn is not a warrior. only now she mentioned him
Ive found myself skipping through about 3 4 of the episodes because of how insanely boring it is. especially any scenes involving the harfoots. I feel like they re there solely to add in more screentime  nothing else. they took 3 steps back in this latest episode. this entire season  so much has happened yet I cant tell you one iconic scene or episode that really had me on the edge of my seat or really held my attention for most of the episode
yay for discord notifications and earlier flights home! I just got home and got some food  now this!
I gave up on watching rings of power... I just cant do it anymore mel lol...
do sugar free gummy bears have real bear parts in them  if they are sugar free and bear free what are they
I started screaming.
everyone seems to miss the full import of what disa said... we ll rule this mountain and all others... she s got ambition.
as bad as I think this show is in some areas. you cant scoff at the idea that the harfoots are devastated by the burning of their carts. they are not only their homes but their shelter and camo from danger. everything they have is gone.
3 16 he went to the corner store for cigarettes and never came back.
the unanimity on the vileness of the harfoots is hilarious.
this show has a weird thing for close ups of dirty fingers
erm... excuse me  galadriel is kicking a. she dodged an arrow by riding side ways for 3 minutes after which she exploded an orc. hello ! have you been watching  this is so empowering to women! you are a woman right  right! so there is the answer  this series is amazing.
never mind I looked in the description and found it
my stomach is gurgling bad ngl
@melonie mac go boom  wish you luck!
I quite liked the stuff with elrond and the dwarfs.  the tho whole elves die without mithril thing seems kinda dumb.
omfg  you literally said man flesh at the same time I did lmao!!!!!
but celeborn was alive and pretty well in the lotr trilogy....so they either  magically  revive him... or this is a confirmation this series and the lotr trilogy doesnt belong to the same  universe
they re filming season 2 because the sunk cost fallacy doesnt apply when its someone else s money and there are no repercussions.
your take s pretty funky beside efaps  drinkers and fnts! good sh...!
alas they are driving the final stake on galadriel and tolkien s masterpiece   auta I l me  and   aur  entuluva   have you fallen to rings of power  with the showrunner s now declaring in their most recent article that phans who oppose the show are evil  despite what these remaining episodes bring  is now redundant  for their arrogance is forged in rop. we invite all to discover our  exsurge tolkien  and have a counter perspective to rop and discover how it is full of heresy and hubris. the heresy of hubris is the most damning  for it is the single vice that binds all the persons developing the rings of power to the supremacy of a will that is anti-tolkien  ironically leading the very destruction of the beloved treasure the  theyocracy  of the machine claims to cherish. the showrunner s design for rop aligns with the mortal sin that fundamentally changes the craft of professor tolkien s canon and the spectacular secondary world  as melkor enslaved  corrupted  and broke the firstborn children of iluvatar  the elves.
it would take some kind of man flesh to marry a dame like galadriel. and was that eminem in that episode
I haven t watched the show  but cut scenes  come across like a Lord of the rings parody.
Imean  did you expect it to get better
you know... if you want to suffer for a good cause  you could just do some streams where you play dark souls. you dont have to do this. amazon does not deserve your eyeballs and time. appreciate you for your mental and physical fortitude though.
pretty easy  you just ignore everything tolkien wrote.
are there any scenes where she isnt scowling  like any at all
beautiful episode  I realise now Im in love with the elf woman
how nice the orcs have a home
they should name itsnore-dor instead cos nothing s happening!  lol.  real talk  they should have killed at least half the cast from that pyroclastic flow!  next episode - balrog goes apeshit and kills all the dwarves cos it didn t like that tiny little leaf falling down there.  get off my lawn! lmao.  should ve listened to daddy  durin!
every time hobo gandalf decides to do some magic  the hobo hobbits decide to try killing themselves with his magic. this whole plotline shouldn t be there  it is so horribly written. pippin in the original trilogy was somewhat dumb and annoying  and these writers decided to create a whole tribe of pippins.
thank you for watching this so I dont have to.
this show is hiting a new low
gonna have to do some major cardio  after all the butter and sugar you been eatting lately
I thought this episode of rings of boredom ever end!
not just the movies  but the books too as celeborn is very much alive in them.
well  she s more of an equine type.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
I haven t been eating sugar  I said those were sugar free gummies  p
c mon  this is the best show ever. galadriel is the greatest - dont be a hater! but that dwarfs wifey....she s bad news  Im tellin ya...bad news
this show and  she hulk  are so shitty but at the same time youtubers dont miss an episode and making a video about it every week.
1 billion well spent!
as cute as youre looking today  maybe you should be dressed as gandalf for these  I d consider that canon before rings of power tbh
its getting a second season !
how is this show still this bad      come on   you didn t expect its vapid crew of writers to suddenly develop actual talent now   did you
I dont know how we are supposed to take guyladriel seriously as a warrior. she walking along with a teenage boy and she s shorter and less imposing in full armour.
be careful with long clips of executive shows  it can be blocked by...
thankyou amazon for making adar and the balrog the hero s Im rooting for to wipe out all these self righteous melodramatic hypocrites you have created and falsely given tolkien names.
still a lot of  ctrl c      ctrl v  from peter jacksons film hiding under a tree-thing when bad guy heard something ... and I still dont understand how galadriel standing in  700 degree celsius ash cloud still is alive   I dont undertand how they got the job to do this and why no one in the crew hundreds of people dont say anything to them ... like in episode 6 sunrise in the west  night in the soutland village but day time when the numenorians where riding ... I admit they have a lot of nice  not unique since it is still  ctrl c      ctrl v  from peter jacksons films  scenes ... but thats it. if they where taking stills for postcards it would have been good. but nice shots is not enough to build a story. especially when they destroy the story from the so important  books  books  books ...  they claim they base the story on. I have tried to see this series as if it is a standalone fantasy story  with no connection to tolkien ... but even then I failed to like it ...
air becomes heavily super-heated when a volcano eruption occurs  never mind the lava or the shockave  the air alone is 1 170 degrees celsius  2 140 degrees fahrenheit . none of them should be alive right now. this is so painful to watch. I fell asleep on episode 3 and folded. what a snoozefest.
the one thing I love about this show is how the harfoots are hated by all regardless of religion  race  gender or iq.
evil dissa is scary
the most bizarre thing to me  alongside the atrocious writing  is how obtuse the writers are in term of scaling things in this lotr universe.the southlands kingdom consists of one broken watchtower  and literally 3 houses. which cant even be called a proper village.numenor assembled a force of 300 soldiers under the pretense they are going to fight a major conflict and liberate some kingdom on the mainland. 300!  the soldiers look like a bunch of teenagers. with badly fit armor which looks like its made out of plastic.and of course  the identity politics  is in the core of this garbage. duo of male hobbits  replaced by the duo of female hobbits. all female characters arent questioned on their actions  they are always right. on every opportunity  there are subliminal messages how women are always correct and whatnot.they cant lift some debris to free someone buried under it. but wait. now the queen comes to help and they finally lift it.and the black hobbit telling his wife  how she is always fucking right. and how they should be united. while in the previous episode  she was calling to abandonthe wounded ones. galadriel says speaking of killing the enemies make you evil. yest in the previous episode  she literally said she will destroy every single orc she can find and stab adar to death in the heart.she is simply is an arrogant cunt  always angry and seeking violence to resolve the conflict she always creates herself  with anyone who even slightly disagrees with her. does this sound like a character which is 3000 odl and should be one of the wisest elven mages  sounds like a karen to me!the only people who claim to enjoy this show  are the brainless woke morons  who are unable to apply any critical thinking to whatever they see on the screen.
the wrongs of power  demonstrates how difficult it is to write a truly compelling and interesting story as opposed to how easy it is to write utterly boring shite...
how is itstill bad  I ll tell you  putting the complete disregard of the lore and the dumb push of the  message  aside  the writers are totally unqualified.
so these activist writers are going to blame the blasted landscape of mordor not on the evil of morgoth or sauron... but on a climate disaster caused by men.
they have done celeborn a favour here so we dont get another discount actor playing his character
pretty much the entirety of episodes 1-5 could have easily been condensed into about about an episode and a half and not lost any important plot points and had a thousand times better pacing. there were essentially 5 episodes of roughly 5 sets of characters having the same conversation over and over again.this show is so incredibly boring and Ive now given up on it. didn t watch ep.7 and doubtful that I ll ever get around to it. if this show didn t have lotr in its title all of season 1 would have been released at the same time and season 2 would have already been canceled.
i... got no fun facts for this one  Im just... sad.
and its still getting a 2nd season despite the whiny temper tantrums of conservatives and libertarians review bombing the show.
sadly yes  but at least thats more content for me
@melonie mac go boom  I ll never watch the show but Im here for you taking it apart lmao
@melonie mac go boom  its more content for you  but thanks to your hate watching and the hate watching of geeks   gamers  nerdrotic and the quartering   its getting a second season. what ever happened to if you dont like a show  dont watch it  its not that hard of a concepr to grasp.
forreal
she got those superhero poses. her actions are like 1 2 second long  then she does her 3 seconds long pose.
its not bad at all. its setting a foundation for a new age. it takes time. I find it very interesting
instead of pulling her  she just push her into the range of that falling branches for fuck sake xd
mel  the orcs cant smell menflesh because there is no men around  whom do you think is the brat of
considering how much the makers are stealing from the peter jackson trilogy  do they actually have rights to it or should someone start to ask some questions about plagiarism
well just remember they ghosted peter jackson okay. thats enough for me.
2 00 - eating cheetos while watching this .
hey hopefully the last episode will end in a bang
melonie never responds to or likes any of my comments. its very emotionally devastating.
he probably ran away............... bahahahahahahahahaha
how did they survive a pyroclastic flow it moves at hyper sonic speeds and is hot enough to melt steel not too mention the toxic gas and super heated ash which leaves no oxygen too breath make it make sense did she finally use magic or is she wonder woman now
jinx on man flesh.
I haven t watched it yet  should i
this is written like a 1990s mid saturday show. a billion dollars my ass.
because they re woke sherman tankers how never learn
what do you mean nothing happened  .there was a dwarf make-out scene
missed opportunity on caller her she sin hahah
how in God s name did the numenoreans find the time and man power to set up a camp
my question is.. how do they know that it was an orc made eruption not a natural one!!
many people burned  the houses burned  the trees the earth burned galadriel and some lucky ones did not burn anything  not even their hair.galadriel spends 1000 years searching for sauron but wait and wht about celeborn  naaa why to bother dude that man is dead.queen miriel tells elendil thatshe does not want them to know thatshe is blind so as not to show weakness but then appears with a blindfold on her way to numenor hahahah its a pure comedy.
well this whole thing is fan fiction so Im not surprised if they just forgot to write her a husband and child.... she is  going to be banging sauron.
I advise against it unless youre gonna watch it like mystery theater 3000 for the sheer ineptitude of it.
lol 11 45 the one hobbit girl be walking like she shit her pants
at 0 56 is there pb on script or they are just bad.some hobbit    -  get back    actually lie on the ground
does the writers know about a village called pompeii.
it was so boring even melonie couldn t get a belly laugh going.boom
albenese gummies!!
how and why are you still watching a show you dont like
yep  this show is absurd.
husband ! what was all that one in a million talk
so thaaaaats why hobbits never leave the shire by the lotr era
I dont think any of these people have read the silmerillion.
mount doom was created in the first age not the second age.

1 39 Im out.
its literally only happening so the writers can make galadriel bang sauron.
it only gets worse
those are the best gummy bears and gummy worms in the world. nice choice
they even did mount doom dirty. turning it into a joke. its cheetos mountain now. f this show man.
no man would be with her him cisguyladriel or whatever.
this bad has to be on purpose
I tried to like this show but its too obscene tolkien s lore means nothing to these people.if it were up to me  I d retcon the whole of season 2.
Im convinced the writers of the series will come out one day and say this timeline depicted is one of many multiverses in the lotr saga to justify this bastardization of the original literature.
@maliwan  at this point they have to do that
@maliwan  yes  but even that wont explain why galadriel is going after sauron when tolkien in all of his lore and legendarium never has her doing that. and tolkien never had galadriel going to or being in numenor.
@grosbeak   who needs explanations when its set in a different universe then that of the og tolkien lore   ---- rop writers  probably
@maliwan  yeah anybody who says its fantasy and therefore anything goes doesnt understand world building and storytelling. fantasy literature is a genre of world building and storytelling. tolkien described this as a secondary creation. so basically these people just dont understand tolkien and  secondary creations .
and having no understanding that elves marry for eternity. they know they will be reunited in the halls of mandos.
@ron w  Im assuming he isn t even dead but held captive by hal-sauron
the balrog appeared  really
they destroyed the wagons and food  what shall we do in this valley full of fruit-bearing trees  oh the shock. oh the horror.
they really dont give a dam
there are hentais with more story and charecter development.
how is she a alive how
timber...
this is why amazons drone program needs to be fast tracked then people like this youtuber would think twice about criticising ceo mr bozo.
glad I watched the prime broadcast of the nfl  which might have been the worst game in the super bowl era  instead of this.
sauron is alive and well and along with his minions made this garbage to soil the good memory of lotr   d
I am sorry girl luv your videos but I cant watch more of this cause I cant even watch the rings o p as a comedy with ya
how were they not all vaporized bytheerrrr
dwarf women are supposed to look so similar to men that other races cannot tell them apart. where are my dwarf lady beards
cheetoladiel
I have you know that is not gandolf
sometimes stupidity can be entertaining.  this is not.
Im so pissed thatso many non brits  brits know us well  will think this is what irish accents are like!! why cant they get the fuckin accent even close
12 33 balrogs slept the entire 2nd age. I accepted the earlier showcase since it was a flashback  but this isn t and actually contradicts the lore.
its really simple  you hire a team of incompetent virtue signalling writers and let them do as they please  show ruined
harfoots blah
for like 0.25 seconds because thats all the 1 billion dollar budget could afford
I dont think they worry too much about the lore.
props on you for trying to watch. not sure I have the energy to bother with this trash
ropisaflop
this one of the shows you gotta binge cause of how slow and boring it is I checked out at ep 3 and forgot it existed
this show is irredeemable
the truth is amazon . the rings of power failed    and if you dont take real action and fire the showrunners and the writers and directors  . and fix the show and hire all new with more  experienced showrunners .writers directors  .with more  experienced people  please repair  our  trust  in you .  season 1 failed hard and  with all the modern day stuff should never be in tv shows  that are based in fantasy based shows  . and the wired agendas should not be in it also
remember  no hatewatching.
this show is not about anything!
um...any and every elf would stop a horse on fire...why didn t she do anything ! the showrunners know more and more of nothing...
wha ! surgar-free gummy bears!  your poor colon.
Im sorry  melonie. I cannot watch this video because you unironically made me endure audio from the rings of power. I can deal with video clips because its memeable  but add sound and youre just torturing me. please stop hurting people who love you.
boom
hImelonie I just wanted wish youon having nice relaxing weekend with your family takecare melonie
its lotr fan-fiction
I hate harfoots now  I still love hobbits though
rings of cringe
how is rings of power still this bad at episode 7  very simple  its rings of power.
its like bad fan fiction with a big budget
its pretty easy to make a bad show when one is a talentless propagandist. its not as though these writers spent  1 billion of their own money.
when writers prioritize making a midevil fantasy story  reflect the modern world  then you already know they are not prioritizing accuracy. but this show  far beyond that is just very bad writing. there is no talent behind the making of this show. the writers are not talented at all. in fact they totally suck at their jobs.
ah but you see the reason the not hobbits were freaking out is cause they re all a bunch of evil little psychopaths and know that now that their wagons are gone they ll be left behind to die. the not hobbits are to stupid to realize there is nobody to fall behind from but thats what happens when your whole society is a bunch of simple-minded  filthy  eternal wanderers.
Im not hate watching  I have to watch this stuff to review it on my channel lol
oh absolutely   @melonie mac go boom . somebody s got to endure it for the rest of us  youre a damn hero!
nothing about this series has said  fan  to me......this series is a deliberate desecration of tolkien s works  and should never be called  fan-fiction !
@19thefallen  fan-fiction in the sense of someone rewriting characters badly and in their own image  without much thought to dialogue choice or actions taken in the course of the plot. nearly all fan-fiction consists of well-known fictional characters from popular franchises fulfilling the inner desires of fanfic writers  even in abject rejection of original authorial intent.
your so right mmgb the show is boring. it could be any fantasy type show under the sun. yawn!
this is so bad  ring s of power is up there withdragon ball evolution and netflix death note
if you think these shows suck so bad why do you keep watching them
if I know anything about anything its 1990s pierce brosnan volcano movies. and let me tell you - that was a pyroclastic flow and nobody was going to survive it. and the horse on fire  game of thrones did it better - in its final season - which was awful enough.
honestly  why would they carry on with the  what happened to isildur  thing as long as they have  we all know he makes it!!! did the writers know before they wrote this  this show is absolute trash
I dont know how anyone watches this damn show. just watching snippets from you and other youtubers who are reviewing this trash makes me want to chug a fifth of whiskey to forget how bad it is
lmfaoo this show is soo bad melonie sounded bored explaining how bad it was. I feel bad for you psychie. dont worry you wont have to torture yourself anymore soon
the writing is truly crap Imean the whole village got hit by like 2000 degree super heated air and lava thats the show they all died!lol
and yet normies keep insisting that this heresy s is canon lfmao
thanks for blocking me on twitter. I was hoping you would understand but oh well. I still like your work  but I was just trying to get through to you. I been through alot in my life  and you basically blocked me over nothing. thanks alot.
its just a sad and pathetic show.  ugh.
numenoreans accomplished nothing. whether they came to the rescue or not didn t matter.
why is every race devoid of any logic   lol
youre right. rop is pretty boring. I wouldn t say its horrible  but often boring and overall disappointing.
man flesh exactly .its all a rip off
boring show. seems like its basically impossible to hire good writers nowadays.
it is simple  poor writing  no passion  not following the source material and laden with agendas  etc...
great job summarizing this boring show !
let us know when they kill off galadriel and a few dozen harfeet.  I ll watch then.  unless they get real got up in this bitch  Im out.
elendil releasing berek... you think they re going to copy aragorn being rescued by a horse in two towers  I think so very much - no originality. reheated motifs.
just goes to show you  youreap what you sow. with amazon  1  billion dollars worth for 2 seasons of a hodgepodge recycled trilogy with crummy insert characters.
looks boring
this show is terrible the worst. how did they survive tge blast lol omg.
why cant hollywood make something new... stop fucking up classics
this show is so bad I have to skip through reviews. sorry
I wish you wouldnt give this crap a view honestly
this show is trash I stopped watching it lol
this basic hate-watch channel is to show reactions what alex jones is to journalism.
I watched this in about 25 minutes  I skipped when bored and I was bored a lot. the dialog is awful  the story is just utterly dull and predictable.so many convenient plot points which are unexplained  itshould be rings of macguffins
downvoting for this for sugar free gummy bears.
are you single  cause Im trying to flirt over 9 000.
I review tv shows and such on this channel so I have to lol
