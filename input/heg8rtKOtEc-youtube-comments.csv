the irony of him saying someone needs to read something when he couldn t even be bothered to read the bill
funny thing is that I remember ron perlman being kinda cool before he got on the twitter...
I never cared if a teacher was gay or what they did on a weekend  I was looking for a teacher not a friend.
he was so charismatic as hellboy. there are so many cool one-liners in those movies and his delivery was perfect. it evoked classic lara vibes. I guess its a testament to his skill as an actor that I can love a character he played without necessarily liking him as a person  although  tbh  Im fairly indifferent towards him . but he should lay off the social media. its bad for your mental health.
so he canthrow the nazI label around even as a jew and its fine  he can act like a threatening psycho and thats also fine  theres the privilege.
his twitter meltdown started about 7 years ago.this is just one of those intermittent moments where he opens the blinds and we can see into the crazy-house.
ron has a problem with rage.he also has a problem with reading comprehension.melonie  you are a breath of fresh air.  thank you for the Bible verses.  as someone who has been struggling with his fellow Christians over the past few months  its nice to see just some good  old-fashioned  straightforward affirmations.
to be honest  ron has been this way for a long time. even before his tds was made public. he needs more help than ezra miller.
oh and as an aside  the  separation of church and state  was meant to protect the church  not the state.
Im so glad I was a 90 s kid because I didn t have to go through this crap! I had a great childhood for it. I feel so sad for kids these days!
here s a proverb for ron pearlman   even a fool  when he holdeth his peace  is counted wise.
as someone who lives in florida and knows what the  dont say straight   thanks tim pool for changing that  bill. Im happy with it. it is common sense. why do 5 year-olds need to know about spicy  to quote the quartering  topics  my only guess is that they wanting to make more cuties movies.
I watched moon knight  and I have to say it had a good start. I loved the psychological horror route itseemed to take for the first episode and I hope it doesnt degrade like the rest of the shows did.
I long for the good old pre-social media days  when you could go through life enjoying an actors films  blissfully unaware of what colossal a-holes they were in real life.
jeremy s video on this is hilarious
ron perlman has had insane moments before. I still like the man. I still want to meet him in person and ask him to autograph my hellboy books. it was from his performance as hellboy that I became hooked on the character and the mythology of the whole story.
I guess its true  then. ron perlman does ad-lib all his lines  because there s no way he s getting through a script with this level of reading comprehension! gotta admit  that takes talent.
hIms. mac. saw you on simp cast and have been following ever since. one thing that doesnt seem to be taught in school anymore is to think for yourself and to question everything.
ron did literally one thing of note his whole life  he narrated fallout 1 and fallout 2. he wont be remembered for anything else. war. war never changes.
will smith ron perlman ezra miller haha hollywood is falling apart before our very eyes and its glorious to watch
social media has exposed a lot of the fake  tough guy  celebs. saw perlman at a comicon several years ago  and he was colossal ass then. he was very concerned that everyone waiting in his line paid the fee  bought the merch  etc.
right  and if a child asks you anything off topic than what you are teaching  you can simply respond with  you can ask your parents about that when you go home   and leave it at that. its not like kids dont ask personal questions already  so teachers have been redirecting kids  questions since the inception of education  lol.
I was just looking for recess then lunch  then home time and overall the weekend
struggling with his fellow Christians     what do you mean
@varanid9  me.  I have been.
@tak178  what do you mean  struggling    though   you haven t punched or shot them I hope
just sounded crazy
little donnieeeee
I wonder what else perlman and miller have in common...
that is unequivocally not true whatsoever.
it is true. and no amount of crying  nuh-uh  will make it less true. faith guides worldviews. the idea that itshould be kept separate from politics is as impossible as it is silly. furthermore  you wouldn t want a world where politics was completely cutoff from faith and the church. without the influence of faith in the political sphere you lose the abolition movement and the civil rights movement. are there wrong ways to let your faith influence politics  absolutely. as a Christian and a libertarian  I am constantly reminding my fellows that it is not our place to criminalize temptation. ultimately such efforts are futile and lead to more harm than good. overall however  faith and the church has been a net positive  both in the creation of our government and our continued governance.
it was made to protect both. you wouldn t want the new politician outlawing a certain religion  and history has taught us government and religion doesnt mix well at all
thecriticaldrinker actually made a video about that. you might enjoy it
were or are
I just long for the days pre social media. couldn t care less how the actors are in real life.
the intro s awesome lmao
he also made hellboy 1   2  thank you very much.
the meltdowns never get old  especially when they re so off base and have absolutely no idea what they re talking about.
melonie  ron pearlman had a bit of a meltdown.me  umm  define a bit.seriously hollywood is now an insane asylum where the inmates make movies.
came off solid with this take. responses on general outliers were clean. unfortunately  since its twitter and their algorithm is heavy stacked  outliers are the norm. tough fight. keep it up.
just found this channel  what a genuine breath of fresh air  the Bible does say that a sign of the last days are critical times hard to deal with  and people being more lovers of pleasure than lovers of God and man one look at social media and we can see prophecy coming true. I dont see how not sexualizing children is somehow wrong or homophobic... then again people s attention spans are not disciplined enough these days to fully read the bill in full to begin with -- so with thatsaid  stay sane  and have a great day.
ron pearlman   please hollywood I need work pleaseeeeeee
we need a scholar to go back and pinpoint the exact moment in history when it became ok for entertainers to publicly advocate for child molestation.
as a grandparent I know kids ask questions and if you do not give them a satisfactory answer they will keep asking. over and over.
I dont live in florida  unfortunately  but I read the whole bill.  its no exaggeration to claim that anyone that opposes it is either a liar  an idiot  a groomer  or possibly all three.  my guess in ron s case is thatsecond option  but cant rule out the others.
melonie  Ive been here since the beginning and commented on all of them! my birthday is on april 5 and maybe a guy going through a brain cancer treatment can get a happy birthday and or prayer  we need more positivity in this world and every day  I wake up ready to live each day the best I can!
ron perlman drank the koolaid.
this is kinda weird I was literally thinking before I wonder what melonie thought about the hellboy movies and one day later this video dropped giving me a answer. thats crazy and awesome. the Lord works in mysterious ways.
I do agree with some people  im starting to get burned out with superhero movies but im still be willing to see a couple of more like  morbius  or  aquaman 2 . giant monster movies on the other hand thats a different story  I ll never get burned out  thats my genre right there baby! . cant wait for pacific rim  the black  season 2  to come out.
I dont even care to see anything with ron in it anymore.
ron is exactly the same character he played in drive.
I dont understand how anyone can read that bill wrong unless they read it in braille with thier toes
you d have a hard time convincing me this guy isn t a spoiled brat.  doesnt matter how old you are physically  if youre a spoiled brat  youre a spoiled brat.
the funny thing is he brings up the first amendment as some sort of shield  but when your in school as a public school teacher   an employee of the state  those same protections do not apply. freedom of speech protects you speaking as a private citizen  what you say in the classroom is considered speech on behalf of the school district and does not have the freedom of speech protections of an individual.
ron perlman sounding like me trying to be deep  poetic and socially conscious on myspace bulletins back in the day  seriously. if the past few years have shown us anything about celebrities its that they overestimate themselves on every level. maybe playing pretend all the time isn t the best career choice after all  it appears to blur the line more and more between how important actors actually are vs how they act on screen.and I feel like trump tds deserves some of the credit when it comes to these social media outbursts. like him or not  trump has seemingly forced these people to unmask their pretentious  highfalutin true selves  for the common people to witness and tear into. it may not actually humble any of them when the internet rips them up  but hopefully the masses learn to stop idolizing these people so the fame doesnt go to their head so much from now on
youre a good influence
thanks mel! have a good day! go boom!!!!
and bad movies at that
@jeremy stevens   right  because there are people that can make video game based movies infinitely better than what hollywood canthese days. I still remember landfall when halo 3 was gonna become a big thing and as low budget as it was it was amazing even to this day  especially for people who are learning to be able to use those type of effects
its mostly marvel s fault because they constantly have shows or movies running 24 7. soon as a show or movie ends  they have another one lined up right away. its never ending and exhausting. I liked marvel movies at the beginning. its so tedious now.
is pr any good  I watched the first episode and it didn t really grab me
just want to add I know that dc has a lot of stuff too. but not nearly as much. and so much of dc s stuff isn t even connected to each other that you can pick and choose. with marvel its like  oh I have to watch this in order to catch references to the next thing.
@ben hagstrom  yes it is. not only is it a good follow up to the first movie but its probably one of the best shows on netflix currently  besides cobra kaI .
the last few years has destroyed actors in general for me. every damn week  month and year - celebrities we once respected and liked turn out to be an ass. I guess the saying  everything woke touches turns to shit  is now subject to people too.ohwell  he made his money and now its  cool  to be woke. but just forget that majority of hollywood allowed abuse to go unchecked. outrage over  dont say gay  but where was his outrage when all the abuse was rampart in hollywood  give it time and people will go through ron s history and see his true colors.
thanks ron. its the 1st amendment. melanie good luck wit your teaching...
I cant wait for people to stop giving celebrities any attention. too many of these people are  at best  detached from reality  and at worst  truly awful people. we do not need to hear their hot  ill-informed takes on anything.
man talk about being afraid to think that being in the in group is more important than being yourself
he has no right to say such disgusting things about desantis
keep up the great work love the daily versus because as God says in isaiah 55 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth  itshall not return unto me void  but itshall accomplish that which I please  and itshall prosper in the thing whereto l sent it.  when you spread his word you never know where and what it will do but it will do something.
hey @melmacgoboom being a Christian do most of your political views automatically lean conservative or are you more of a moderate
I was waiting for touchdown.... on paper     unbreaded!!
this woke behavior is a manifestation of the judgement against them. unfortunately they want to be free from God and they re being given the opportunity to see what life is like when granted that  freedom . yet still this judgement is loving because itstill gives them the chance to see themselves more clearly for who they are apart from God with the chance to turn to him.
and I thought us brits were supposed to be the ones with bad teeth!
its becoming increasingly difficult to separate the art from the artists.  trump broke them all  and at this point Im just watching them as I would a slow motion accident.
I just love when people call others nazis with no proof to go along with thatstatement.
common sense is a super power
how to be an extreme leftist on social media  say whatever you want  bully  threaten  call others nazI s. dont worry about getting banned on twitter  its impossible. how to be neutral or leaning right in any sort of fashion  dont breathe  because taking oxygen from people on the left is a bannable offense.
ron is unbearable..   the guys completely out to lunch.
love him as an actor  but when they fly their flag like this for everyone to see  I have a hard time differentiating their twitter rants from the character Im trying to watch.
him and seth rogan have been going off the rails on twitter for the past few years. sad cause I liked their past stuff
lmao  that was some gangsta twitter vid xd   ya piece of sheeeet!   xdddd
ron perlman   read the first amendment! everybody who can read   ron  read florida house bill 1557 before you rant and tell someone else to read. liberals  but its  dont say gay! non liberals   it doesnt say gay at all. at worst its an antI grooming bill  which is probably why youre against itso much. alphabet teachers   but now I cant talk about my relationships with my first graders. florida parents   we support this bill because we want to know and have a say in what teachers tell our children  and we dont want them learning about sexual relations in kindergarten. we want them to learn math and how to read so they dont end up like ron pearlman ranting on twitter about something he hasn t read.
great vid  melonie.
he probably heard someone else say it and took it as fact since that is obviously what he did with the  dont say gay  bill.
never meet your heroes.
Imean  desantis did kinda bait liberals by calling the bill  dont say gay  bill. he knew they wouldn t read it and would go ape shit lol
no  they understand the context. they dont want you to be able to shape your own children s morals and values. they want to teach your children their beliefs. this bill prevents that.
great actor. clueless human being.
this was such a bad take by ron and his anger shows he s in full npc mode.as a parent you should be wired to protect your children s innocence for as long as possible. 6 year-olds should be about santa etc. and not be burdened with our crap that they cant understand anyway. I dont get the opponents to this  especially disney which is supposed to be a magical place for children  but instead they choose activism. Im glad my kids are older  what a clown show we ve  become.
common sense  you d be surprised how many folks are missing this...
seperation of church and state  is thrown in as a way to always belittle and brush off legislation that may come from a Christian moral perspective. yes  priests shouldn t be the legislature like pre-french revolution france  we re fine with thatseperation. the idea that no religious motivation shall ever be in the law is stupid. law always legislates morality. and atheism is also a faith  it also is a religion with a core tenet and belief system. everybody serves somebody
super hero movies are not the equivalent of westerns. they are the equivalent to those over-budgeted roadshow epics of the 50 s and 60 s.
oh melonie  check your damn instagram lol
its just sad to watch. I loved him as hellboy  they are far better movies then the crap remake  but these insane rants break that enjoyment. another great claimed by the tendrils of wokeness.
all the calling a stag a horse. thanks for the vid.
the bill is called  parental rights in education   thats what s truly  f ed  up about it. utmost sarcasm Imean really  what right do parents have to be involved in their child s education  its not like they gave birth to the child  or spend their hard earned money to feed and cloth said child  and they most definitely dont have to deal with the emotional stress that comes with raising a child. these are clearly experices unique to the state  and special interest groups. what an evil notion that  parents would want what is best for their kids.
Lord hood  halo 2 3  needs to shut up.actors and cultural celebrities have no business talking about politics when they have no clue what they re talking about.I would go so far as to say their fame and level of cultural influence gives them a responsibility to not talk about anything they haven t thoroughly researched.
ron perlman has been unhinged for quite a while now...
Im honestly looking forward to seeing morbius. the dark avengers are far compelling to me than the actual avengers  though the avengers are pretty decent  at least in the comics.
hail mel mac!
I dont understand this take from peralman and the horde. you can still talk to your kids about whatever you feel is pertinent to their lives. this is just saying some unsupervised stranger to you cant do it away from you... to you kindergarten- third grade child. again... you still can. idk why ppl want other adults talking to their kids about sex  its pretty psychotic...
why is sexual education destroying innocence  sexual education is not a synonym for  fucking  or watching porn!and  adulthood  wouldn t hit them that hard   if the teenage kids wouldn t become miseducated by pornhub in first place!may I discribe  as different perspective  how in germany  where I live  the sexual education starts.it begins in the third grade  with the obvious things like the biological defintion of women and man  explaining naming the differences between the genders. and from this point on  the sexual education-lessons develop parallel to its pupils.isn t it rather  how  any education happens than  what  the context is  kids are way smarter and a ton less corrupted by our adultimaginations  -preconceptions. they understand the biological aspect need of intercourse. its us the so called  grown ups  who only think of the intimate lust pleasure. its us who hardly change the perspective to a bit more ratio! thats what I perceive in this video by both mr. ron perlman and mrs. melonie mac  despite that ron perlman has had  lets say  better days ! his rhetoric is everything but no invitation for any dialogue. I have less problem with having an opinion  but a universe more when opinions become expressed  like a absolutist truth that demonises every other opinion as blasphemous  therefore false!anyway  we all can only offer respect not demand it from other!
hollywood more outraged with dont say gay than dont see rape.
ron perlman demanding thatsomeone important read something when he himself  a worthless nobody  hadn t read what he s pretending to understand is almost comical.
he who answers a matter before he hears it then this is folly and disgrace to him. to answer before listening then that is folly and shame. spouting off before listening to the facts is both shameful and foolish. if one gives an answer before he hears  it is his folly and shame. - king solomon
conservatives  talking about sexuality to children is a woke agenda also conservatives to children  youre so cute do you have a boyfriend girlfriend
thank you.
he s a wannabe tough guy
you should talk to  whaddo you meme     I am not sure if you could do a live show though  I think he lost his hearing  he is a great Christian youtuber
yeah  dont remind me
funny how he said to read about the first amendment considering he didn t read the bill.
can you please turn up volume on media clips for next time. his clip was inaudible in my vehicle.  thanks  I enjoy the content
if you are an adult who gets angry because you cant talk about sexuality with a 4 year old  go take a long look in the mirror. but  dont brush your hair while youre there. you ve done enough grooming.
groomers mad af lmaooo
yet another example why celebrities need to stick to acting and just keep their opinion to themselves. every time they open their mouth on twitter they end up exposing how misinformed they are and make themselves look stupid. they always make these ignorant videos with such an arrogant tone like they know better than everyone else. its laughable how ridiculous they make themselves look and they are too stupid to see it.
ron perlman is another of those. actors I like on film and despise off it. I dunno I just cant get excited about what hollywood says about anything  and we should do exactly as we ve done ...laugh at him and call him a clown.
someone had the drinky drinky
a certain type of person would be against that bill and they would be p3d0 s.
the purpose is the controversy is to throw red meat to the soy crowd. also  the purpose of the grooming is to continue to destroy the nuclear family.
hellboy s gone ta hell!
perlman proving he s a has been or maybe a never was and proving he doesnt read anything also he s highly likely secretly a groomer.
I love you.
gman all I got to learn when I went to school was maths english science and I still managed to have fun at school the only heavy thing we had to worry about is what we re having for lunch now kids have to be sensitive to each others needs and how to be scared of their own shadows and how that there is no longer boys and girls there s 123 difference sexist pretty heavy stuff for a kid preteen let alone a teenager why cant we just let kids be kids. take a note only have fun for a short time in their life and now adults want to take it away from them stop the planet I want off.
nobody remember south park getting gay with kids episode
actors know what the bill is and what they stand for. they use the buzz words applied to it because they are told to. just another line in a script. I only have 2 words for these people okay groo mer.

@diskonnekt  yeah  thats a good emojI to describe them
@underthegun897    Im pretty sure no one says that to kindergarteners  which is who the bill is for  and if someone says that to a child  it is clear that they are not referring to a relationship that involves sexual intercourse but something along the lines of a special friend. the bill just says thatsex education should not occur before 3rd grade. thats it.
@Christian stamos  wow you ve never heard a grandpa or grandma or aunt or parent or parents friend say  so how many cute girls in your class  got any girlfriends   to a 9 year old boy  I dont believe that
@underthegun897  apparently my previous reply was deleted. whatever. anyway  the law in question is about sex ed. not about being annoyed that your grandfather asked if you have a crush on someone in class. in short  what a girlfriend is to a 9 year old  is not the same as what a girlfriend is to a 29 year old.
him and michael rapaport. someone should put the two of them in a ring and watch them try and fight  it would be gay gay gay!
no tomb raider talk in this video.
when did he get a lazy eye
the  dont say  concept would save alot of leftists from a great many things.
mel I like your out goingness but Godzilla vs kong new and old are the most worst movies in the franchise. just caught up on some of the vids Imissed love your videos for further reason why is simple old Godzilla 150ft kong 50ft new Godzilla 350ft kong 300ft wtf they knew Godzilla would just be a bully to kong. kong never stood a chance now there going to make a 2ed one fml lol
... they did the exact same shit at the oscars and to florida  have a very gay evening  gay gay gay gay gay ...they are trying to mock florida and end up ridiculing themselves
he s such an angry old man... you should hear the posts he made to ted cruz as well. haha
what gets me about some of the replies of these teachers to the bill is that they clearly just haven t a clue what they were put on this earth to do. children dont need to know about a teacher s personal life. straight or gay it doesnt matter what your home life is.  I cant recall  any of my teachers saying too much about their personal lives just a comment here and there and thats it. so why do they think children of these young ages need to know they have any home-life at all
oof
lol  this is what happens when you take up acting and quit grade school  .remember what Jesus said about hurting little one s and where a millstone should go
when did opposition to talking about sex in kindergarten become  conservative . for that matter when did anything to the right of mao become conservative  bill maher is under fire now.
jmo but itshould be from k-12. no reason for this crap to be brought up in school period.
no coletrain  no like! we need cat!
read about it  he should really take  his own advice...  unhinged loon.
imagine being so proud of your inability to be informed that you post videos verbally assaulting people over a non-issue.
really disappointed with ron... had always enjoyed his work  be he s just plain lost it.
whenever these celebs do the gay  gay  gay thing the scene of squeal like a pig from deliverance comes to mind.
ron perlman was amazing in hellboy but since then has gonna completely off the rails with the woke ideology. he just like everyone in hollywood need to commit to doing what they do best reading the lines that other people right and make movies that no one watches. also how is this dude a millionaire and has teeth like those.
lotta people haven t even read the bill  I doubt it even says dont say gayare people really supporting teach k-3rd about sex  thats up to the parents
just here to put a like down   avoiding trying to avoid this bs on social media for a week to cleanse lol . been reading books instead .
muh gay rights  reeeee!!   ok groomer
adrenochrome  not even once lol
agree
cause they re tools puppets
funny how the first amendment only applies to him  he d lose his shit over someone burning a pride flag.melanie I think you are giving them too much credit. they know what they are doing. they deliberately dont read the bill.
ron... ron pearlman...  read the freaking bill before u rant... just saying...
tbh I didn t even like hellboy  so yeah  not a fan of perlman at all. in fact  when he s in a movie  he always comes off as cringe to me.
hey
but what if I wanna use my 1st ammendment to talk about things of a sexual nature to kids under the age of 5  is this america anymore  what s next  no hamburgers
sup doody head.
