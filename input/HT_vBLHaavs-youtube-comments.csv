kind of a conspiracy here  but I feel like more and more games will become more story focused because otherwise how would the snobby writers force their woke views on people.more broadly though  I think a lot of writers fear their  good  writing will go unnoticed by a lot of people if the game doesnt spit the story directly on to your face. I noticed the best kind of lore in games are slowly put together throughout the game or series of games  and you discover the lore through the environments and small interactions here and their.
dixon is more based than yourealize. he s helped ya boI zack  from the channel comics matter  with multiple projects for splatto comics including the expendables go to hell.
Ive reached the point where as soon as I see woke people show in fandoms I bail. they re just going to destroy the enjoyment whether or not they take it over anyway. its not worth the fight.
hey here from the quartering  I understand now why jeremy wanted you to keep up daily uploads. you have quickly become my favorite daily watch. really dig your stance in religion and politics keep fighting the good fight dont let them take our favorite franchises
speaking of woke in the batman  the one scene that just really annoyed me is when catwoman was talking about how the system protects  rich white men . like  you couldn t resist could you  instead of this being a class issue  you had to turn it into a race and gender issue. just another jab at the evil cis-straight white man. that one scene really ruins an otherwise great movie  in my opinion.
imagine watching a western set in the 1800s and there s an atm machine. this is what modern storytelling does to adapted works. its not even a question of if the viewers agree with your narrative. its that the narrative should not exist in the work your drawing from.
I remember playing x-wing in the early-to-mid 90 s as a young teenager. I would stay up almost all night during the summer just trying to reach the next tour of duty cutscene. at that time  anything that made a pc seem like you were watching tv was an amazing spectacle. cinematic cutscenes were a reward  and the resources required to create and play them were not as ubiquitous as today  so they were few and far between. now that the television and personal computer have merged  video game cinematics are the new  direct-to-vhs  movies  bringing their lack of substance with them while also being used to gloss over obvious flaws in the game itself. if a game is created first and foremost to be authentic and enjoyable  stories will grow from them organically. remember  star wars was  star wars  before it was  a new hope .
love dixon s history of comics podcast on unauthorized. also winterworld and its companion novela are master works. dixon is a master in comics and a legend. blooded also very good ungay version of interview with a vampire. highly recommend anything and everything dixon touched to read.
I absolutely love your tomb raider  rants  never have I seen anyone give such in depth analysis to a character before. if the gaming industry had more people like you I wonder how much better games would be overall.
you know who did cut scenes vs gameplay right  westwood studios did cut scenes fantastically. the command and conquer games  most of them  has a great story through line but you could play your game in any damn way you chose.
I dont see why you cant have both  a good cinematic experience and good gameplay. I think the God of war reboot did a great job of both. I thought the gameplay in the reboot was very fun and addictive  especially fighting the valykries  man I was so proud of myself when I finally beat them all  and the challenge level on the fire mountain  I forget what its called . as for the cinematic experience  it was really well done.
when I heard that developers such as tetsuya nomura was given so much freedom to make final fantasy xv as he wanted  to the point that at one point he even wanted it to be a musical...it made me realise something  back in the old days of the ps1 and ps2 era  developers had to be more careful with their time and decisions on not only what a game is supposed to be about  but also how the gamplay is implemented along with the story. nowadays with so much less hardware and software limitations  and a much higher budget  developers almost seem to get too much freedom. to the point that they want as much flash as possible  but little to no substance.I imagine that its the same case with movies. with cgI and video editing software being a hell of a lot more advanced than it used to be.
of course rings of power is an abomination  I just miss the days when I could blindly watch things without caring about the woke agenda  now I can barely watch anything  tvshows just feel like a turn off these days. they butchered halo  moonight is pretty much gone because they are stressing the female leading the male  race swapping  insertion of politics  they are trying to censor games  we need to gate keep  our hobbies harder. anyway keep up the good work  its not easy with haters around
I like cinematic games. mass effect is my all time favorite franchise  but I dont want it to be the default style. I dont want any studio to pressured to make games a certain way. it always seems to happen  though. once a popular and successful game comes out  everyone wants their game to look that way. when gears of war came out  everyone wanted to have cover shooting in their game. after mass effect came out  lots of games started having radial menus.
chuck dixon is a great batman writer and was influential in regards to the initial development to the tim drake robin. his stories always have a real adventurous spirit and am happy to see him still in the public eye
I like that youread our comments. it is a great way to motivate fans to get involved in the conversation and watch the videos in case of a shout-out. if someone I know doesnt drink Im cool with that  its good to have a sober driver  I only have a couple of drinks when Im out with friends anyway. its a safe bet that rings of power is going to bomb because the show runners dont care about the fans  they only care about their bank accounts. tolkien was a great storyteller  he enjoyed entertaining people  that was his main priority. if they focused on entertaining people and giving fans what they want  they would make more of what they want. thanks for another great video  I appreciate it.
zeitgeist  pronounced  zaitguyst  for an english speaker. its german for  ghost of our time .itsort pf describe the current cultural trend and talking points of the current era.in this day and age it would be the conversation around social justice  since it occupies the media and politics the most.dont intend this to come across as mr. smartypants. I just wanted to help out a little.
going off on rings of power while repping rainbow brite. respect  melonie!  d
personally I like story fist games  but even Ive got to admit not all games should be story first  and even in story first games there needs to be a reason its an interactive game instead a more passive medium.
about tr  there s no reason so set up an explicit back story for her.  so often  the best lore is that which is subtly hinted at.  it leaves room for the imagination to grow the story in our own minds  which makes the characters more relatable to everyone.
literally what sony does lol almost all of their exclusives are always movies with some gameplay
I hate all of these walking  talking simulators.
@anti-bs  you ve never played a sony game if thats what you think
but there is no story behind agendas. its just the agenda.
there was an account by someone who worked in gaming both in japan and the west  who said in japan  pitches for a game were like a couple pages and mostly focused on gameplay. in western companies  a pitch was several pages long  with the first few being about the story and setting  and near the end they d finally bring up gameplay. which would explain why western games  trailers tend to be nothing but artsy cinematic videos  and when you actually play the game  its just gears of war call of duty etc. with nothing ground breaking  just a pretentious story thats not as great as they think.
another thing that pissed me off  while I did love it  was them portraying him as an out of touch billionaire that is just beating criminals did these ppl take 5 minutes to watch the opening of batman begins or read the comics he lived among the homeless and in the slums of multiple countries to learn about crime and how to defeat it he didn t just put on a suit he prepared for years in advance before the suit was even a thought in his head
it really didn t have to be in there. kinda annoying.
besides it being somewhat true why does it offend you lol
@underthegun897  if you think thats true you dont know gotham  they dont care about abbot skin color they care about power and money which is why they re all basically corrupt. her line makes no sense in context of the batman universe   if you have to race swap a character to have her validate a point the point doesnt have much weight to begin with
@victor von doom  gotham is supposed to be a city that exists in the us so its still based on reality somewhat despite it being a comic book
@underthegun897   no such thing as white privilege
@the kevcast reviews  if youre white it would be ironic to claim that
@victor von doom  yeah  I can kind of see that. it didn t bother me as much because itseems like they re maybe changing his origin a bit. like  in the movies  if Im remembering correctly  its alfred who trained him and not the league or other martial arts masters. plus he s not in a mansion but a skyscraper in the middle of the city and his  batcave  is an abandoned subway tunnel. so maybe this is a very  very early batman who has just started his career and hasn t really trained or gained experience yet. or they re just retconning his origin story to create a new batman.
ace combat zero is also a much later game that did it well.
Ive watched both episodes of moon knight  I am assuming thats what youre talking about  and have no idea what your issue with it is
@underthegun897  its a bait and switch according to az from heelsvsbabyface  check his youtube channel of episode 2 if you want
@silverfox   I just watched episode two last night and thought it was pretty good. first episode was a little slow confusing but itseems its going to pick up during episode three.
@underthegun897  ughh thats it  no more sexist youtuber s for me  I will just let the episodes finish  then torrent  I live in a third world country with a bad economy and Im a unI student   no Im not trying to be racist to black people by saying that or play the racial stereotype of a black unI student in an impvoverished country  I actually mean it  I cantell you about the situation in my country if you want  its ridiculous to be honest. so I dont have a choice  Im just glad someone like you can pay to watch good content
@silverfox   yeah I live in us and disney  is like  7 usd per month
@silverfox   I always recommend watching or reading any content yourself firsthand. so many youtubers nowadays are just grifters trying to make a quick buck and appeal to the emotional radical side of many people nowadays. this goes goes left wing right wing  liberal conservative. there are channels that grift to both sides
@underthegun897  yep thats expensive  its atleast 122.84 a month in my country  so unless I get a job soon  thats a big no.
@underthegun897  damn I didn t realize that  I always thought left wing youtuber s are the enemy and you should always trust right wing youtubers  your comment really says a lot  I get it now thanks.
it was not easy trying to explain to my mom what they did to her favorite characters from lotr in this show. we even had an all white german shephard named  arwen.
keep up the excellent work  melonie. youre awesome.
eI  in german is pronounced like  eye  zeitgeist    zeit  is  time  and  geist   ghost  is like  spirit    spirit of the times syllables rhyme with height or white  zeit geist in contrast  ie  in german is pronounced  ee  as in reeeeeeeee!!
chuck dixon is the writer who created the punisher  and yes  he s based! he writes a lot for arkhaven comics  and they re great reads!
yeah. thats dixon for you. he s one of the based comic creators left over from the old days. and unlike gerry conway his brain is still functioning. keep up the good work.
I would like to see a lara thats kind of aged out of the adventuring being dragged back into it.  dont need to go back to the 90 s to have it be the same character.  Im sure she s done a lot since then.  could have itset in 2022  give her a few wrinkles  and maybe things have leveled off.  she s at a dig site and makes a discovery.  people try to stop her from sharing it with the world  and here we go again.   could use that to explain why its not as easy for her to free-climb sheer rock walls.  would still do it  but add a level of risk.  require player input for her to grab onto that next crevice.
there s one silver lining to rings of power  it ll kickstart another generation of content creators just like the last jedi.
I agree. why even adapt it if you arent even remotely interested trying to keep the look and feel of it  only reason I canthink of is you only want it as another  statue  to tear down.
I finished the tr reboot run. I struggled with the gameplay. why cant you shoot a gun unless you press left trigger to aim  first  the crosshairs were on the target  but unless lt is pressed  rt doesnt work. baffling. anyway  Im still torqued about the hints to continue the story  and I hope that there will be fewer in the new reboot.  not holding my breath  though.  it took me 14 hours this time  and 85 hours the first time  without finishing the game the first time . Imiss the t-rex.
man I feel ya on that whole gameplay vs storytelling thing. wow is well past the point of enjoyment for me because of all the attention blizzard gives to the story as opposed to the gameplay. characters I used to like  such as sylvanas and tyrande  I cant stand anymore. I want the characters to just back off and let me go on an adventure.
a lot of people might not know that chuck dixon wrote the comic  book adaptation for the hobbit  he had such respect for the source material that he published it under  charles dixon  as he thought putting the name  chuck  on the cover would be disrespectful.
I dont expect rop to be good  but I d actually love if itsomehow was good. and I d like to think most of the people Ive listened to dunk on thatshow so far have the integrity and love for the source material that they would be ready to say its good. but not all dreams come true.
thats exactly what we need  big names in the industry to call out that bs trend to homogenize absolutely everything. there seems to be a motto of sorts saying  x is for everyone! . well  elden ring is not for everyone  and look at the success it is making. this attempt to appeal to the lowest denominator eventually take about all the spice  all the uniqueness of whatever hobby fandom  leaving us with some bland  tasteless  sanitized content
zeitgeist  is a german word which is a portmanteau  two words mashed together to combine meaning  of zeit   time  and geist   ghost or spirit  and means roughly translated the spirit of  for example todays  time. it is pronounced roughly tsideghisd  I -like  I am. for the german eI sound
the aod storyline at least deserved a proper resolution  if only because thats where the real lara was when we last saw her. she can go literally anywhere else from there.
chuck dixon is based  period. he s the best batman writer of the past 30 years. I believe he s either conservative or leans right   believes that politics dont belong in comics. I know he has a youtube channel  and Ive only watched a handful of videos  but I tend to agree with him.
everything you just said about classic tomb raider vs tomb raider reboot is exactly why metroid dread was such a triumph to me  return to form and samus says one line  most of the narrative is in context of the gameplay and environment. very  very few talking scenes. same with legend of zelda breath of the wild  super mario odyssey. who needs to talk  we want to play!!!!!
you have an infectious cheeriness in your intros.
the most important thing is to vote with your wallet. do not give people that hate us your money.
giving me plenty of content
based  do you mean biased
did you just say . politics dont belong in comics  have you never heard of the xmen  or seen things like captain america punching hitler in the face  art of all types has  and always will reflect society. this isnt new. its not like batmans never had political things shown or anything  lol
@blake_adam  look up what he said on the subject.
my favorite games have fun  challenging gameplay  and a compelling story. tetris is a good example of a game that only has gameplay  and that doesnt do it for me. walking simulators are on the opposite spectrum  and I dont care for those either. maybe Im greedy  but my favorite games have stories and characters I love  plus challenging and fulfilling gameplay.
there s nothing wrong for cinematic games be as they are  provided the gameplay doesnt take a hit  or we get woke messages. indeed  many are essentially playable series  as you can catch up on the lore  and still be part of the story. check out the naruto series  for example.
if you want to see an example of story over gameplay  take a look at the .hack games. the dungeons were pretty much the same  with not that much variation  and this went on across  four volumes  of the same thing with the .hack  g.u. depressingly enough not deviating from it for the entire three volume span of it. also keep in mind...Im a big .hack  fanboy who owns the physical copy of the bolt shaped .hack  sign boxset  plus the three manga volumes of .hack  twilight   and  some of the light novel  as well as some nice knickknacks like the .hack  special of rena  so when I say gameplay is important  Im not kidding.
on the batman point  to be fair  being out of touch with normal people and being woke go hand in hand. so maybe some of these writers projecting their own worldview on out-of-touch elite characters in films isn t the worst thing to happen
zeitgeist is pronounced like  zite guys t. like the hard  I  sound in the y from xylophone  on both vowels. its a cool german word that means  spirit of society .
glad he has the balls to say it.
melonie  also people who drink dont realize that those of us who do not drink dont want to go to a party where basically all we would be doing is watching other people get drunk  its kind of stupid!
great job as always
I want to see melonie play the last of us 2. the gameplay  story  everything is awesome.
what s up not my groomers  melonie mac here and not going to talk to groomers. - melonie talking to disney board members
15 23 if I wanna watch a movie  I usually read a clive cussler or john j. nance novel.
I want a lotr set in the future where the orcs come out and are wipe out by jets and turrets  while they still use swords
chuck dixon did a very enlightening interview discussion with eric d july on his channel youngrippa59. I recommend melonie and any readers of this comment to go check that interview out.
I have that hobbit book!  its pronounced  zite-g-eye-st  hehehe hope thats useful!
zietgiest - not sure if I spelled it correctly  rhymes with  fight heist .  means cultural spirit of an era.
the 1st tomb raider reboot game I still to this day have no idea how lara lived! after you get to the shanty town you need to cross under the bridge  you have conrad roth covering you with a sniper rifle... after this section you end up in a cave where the solarI have gathered to test sam with the fire ritual. at this point in the game you have  atleast I did  an assault rifle the room ahead is full of solarI cultists yet lara uses her bow! of course lara gets caught but I dont get why they didn t just kill lara right there   then. they for sure dont need her alive  also allowing her to live will just cause trouble later sooooooo why didn t they just kill her
zeitgeist. another german word you cant change because its perfect.
itshould be so simple to do a good lara croft story lolll lara croft goes on twitter  is like what the hell ! and leave the platform forever for an adventure.
the reason lara is the way she is today is because of the studio eidos chose to take over the ip. you cant throw a studio known for story driven cinematic content like soul reaver at tomb raider and not expect some of that dna to mix into the final product. I personally love the direction changes made to tomb raider in both of cd s trilogies. however Im not a fan of rampant hand holding either and like to see some interactive cinematics. I dont know that I agree that the west is fixated on story. good number of games in the west do not. some are worse for it. I do agree that tr needs to get away from lara s personal life. I d like to see a title that helps transition her away from that and make her the tomb raider we knew in the 90s and part of the 00 s before the survivor trilogy came along.
good writers are as rare as a diamond in a mountain of shit these days
for ppl that think he s out of touch really need to watch batman begins he didn t just put on a suit he was in the slums for years studying crime and getting ready this batman felt kind he just put on a suit
the second half of zeitgeist sounds just like the first half that you pronounced correctly. it rhymes.
I disagree with lara giving up her aristocratic heritage.  even in the pre-reboot games  eidos and cd  while she doesnt live a typical wealthy lifestyle of comfort and luxury  her aristocratic upbringing still influences her character in speech and mannerism.  my favorite missions from the classic games include the opera house and tokyo from legend.  when lara is going to these posh settings  she doesnt arrive in her exploration gear like its a tomb or a jungle  or even her casual jeans   leather jacket.  lara arrives like a boss in elegance and style!!  as is appropriate to the situation.it goes to show how lara is adaptable to her surroundings - when she s trekking she s in her athletic wear  on the london streets  jeans... and in thatscenario of high society she carries herself like she belongs there... which she  does .  way I see it  lara s experience didn t make her  forsake  her aristocratic upbringing  she was just opened to new possibilities allowing her to carry that heritage on her own terms.  lara understands the traditions of high society  but isn t a slave to it  and will gladly carry herself with that dignity accordingly as she sees fit to  not as  the rules  dictate.most people label lara croft as an adventurer  as a badass and rebel.... all while missing thatshe s always  again pre-reboot  still exuded class   sophistication of a cultured woman.  and thats something thatshould never be forgotten.
I agree  I wasn t the biggest fan of angel of darkness either...
can you image what would happen if a comic book writer wrote an adaptation of joan of arc and called it johan of arc or even john of arc and had a straight white man be the hero  I dont believe in revenge or retaliation but sometimes I wish that the people wanting these woke changes could see and feel what its like to have an ip they love altered to the point where its almost unrecognizable. ie brokeback mountain 2  ennis and jack go straight. ouch  the rage!
wait there s a comic of the hobbit by chuck dixon  take my money now!
I dont want less storytelling  I want competent storytelling. and storytelling design that makes sense.especially in games where just having the  story  shoved into your face at all times through endless forced-sounding expositions just get s annoying. its so much more rewarding for the player to be able to explore the world of the game through exploration mechanics  interacting with npc s and the world and through gathering lore items and such.also  not all games need to be story heavy to be good. sometimes  its fine to just make something thats plain fun.same with movies  not everything has to be deep  cerebral  or  rather  trying to be but failing  and layered with messaging.sometimes itshould just be fun.there s this overall lack of talent in the entertainment industry these days. the writing in most of the stuff coming out the last 5 or so years are fanfiction-meme levels bad.while  paradoxically enough  Ive seen works coming out of the actual fanfiction and indie communities that  with funding and manpower  would have been masterpieces.its a palpable change  likely the result of a dozen different factors  but is also frustratingly hard to pin down.
rings of power was screwed before it ever got off the ground. amazon doesnt actually have rights to the silmarillion. the only second age content they have rights to are references and the appendices from the Lord of the rings books. even if they wanted to stick to the lore  which I dont think they care to   they couldn t. there are just too many gaps for them to fill.
I drink. but my wife is straight edge. we both believe fully  do you. but dont be dumb
chuck dixon is a very based writer indeed. he s conservative but has made comics for indie comics  from comicsgate  and wrote a story with a gay character the right way--make a great character first  who happens to be gay. professional through and through.
dixon    preach it
I kinda disageee with your intake in cinematic games  I think they are great  like  dont get me wrong  gameplay is also important  but for me  a game needs to have a good story for me to realy enjoy it. the thing is  it has to have both  a good example is acctuly the uncharted games  the gameplay is cool and the story is cool  so uncharted is pretty much my favorite franchise  even if in the latter years they are trying to make uncharted woke  but uncharted 2 and 3 are two of the best games I ever seen in my entire life.
this channel was one of the best things I discovered this year.
I want the rainbow brite t-shirt.
as regards the Lord of the rings and the people rewriting   or trying to rewrite it   I keep going back to a quote from gandalf  describing the mind of sauron  ...the only measure he knows is desire  desire for power  and so he judges all hearts. call me what you will  but this mindset  the mindset of sauron  sounds very much like the mindset of the left-wing activists rewriting and repurposing all the old stories.tell me Im wrong! please! for myself  I d rather not believe that the people writing for the rings of power have the mind of sauron in them!p.s the quote from gandalf is from the fellowship of the ring  book 2  chapter 2   the council of elrond  if you want to find it.
the uk ring of power trailer has 1.1m dislikes
alcohol in itself is not bad for you. like all things  moderation is needed. a small amount can be good for if you make sure to be careful with it.
zeitgeist I believe that was the word you were saying based on the context of the sentence.its best to look up words and use them in a sentence  then add them to your vernacular. not only will it make reading more enjoyable  but you ll better communicate. I still laugh at this youtuber who read the name job the same way she reads job. I laugh because she couldn t take the constructive criticism to learn that. like people who change amen to awomen. take time to understand words and learn that amen has nothing to do with gender. nothing.
brava! truefansdoitbetter
I know this comment doesnt have anything to do with the subject of the video  but I remember when I was a kid seeing my father playing the beginning of tomb raider 2 fighting a tiger  and that game just amazes me  it is one of my first  game memories  and it is really sad that now days I cant stand the new tomb raider  I couldn t even get myself to finish the first and second one  only shadow  but it was still a very mediocre game at the end of the day.
based batman writer. does she mean famed batman writer
nice quote for the comment section of any ring of power trailers  thanks!
there s a lot of interesting health studies out there on the subject. consensus is tricky to find  but  the weight of studies seems to suggest that red wine and spirits aged in wood  e.g.  scotch whisky  bourbon  are the most beneficial  health-wise. something about the antioxidant compounds that are present in red wine and wood-aged spirits.
a foreign language is a little different! I think Ive heard that error made frequently on tv  because english speakers dont know how german is pronounced.
I was a teenager when tomb raider first came out  i.e. the target audience  back in 1996.  lara croft is an action hero ine  character  from the 3d action game that evolved out of side scrolling games that came before it.  drama of that genre encompasses overcoming an obstacle  and defeating the next series of ever tougher enemies.  the idea thatsomeone would try to develop such game  or the central character of such a game  into anything cinematic is frankly laughable  though seeing duke nukeum be rebooted in a similar manner would be a justifiable parody of modern woke game  story telling  just to show how ridiculous the concepts are... .  back in the 90 s  if we wanted  cinematic  games we had all sorts of story adventure games  from simple animated sam and max  back when lucasarts was awesome   to the myst series  and others with strings of live action films.  action games  like tomb raider  were distinct from these  and for good reason  action side scrollers  and the new 3d counterparts  were never meant to be  story driven  beyond the most barebones plot.  they were meant to feed the adreneline rush and test your reflexes  and only instigate strong emotions when you couldn t time that jump across some chasm just right for 10000th time....
zite-guy-stit is a phrase used to describe a phenomenon of a certain era or time. zeit is time and geist is spirit.
strong like bull
games aren t games anymore. they just haven t quite figured out yet how to make a successful interactive movie  because lets be real here. they re more interactive movies than games.
european lore is the youtuber he is an knowledgeable tolkien fan
day 27 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me.its pronounced ze-ayt-guy-st and is like the thought of the time. mansplaining done. proceed to cancel me.also since angel of darkness though I got the  I feel stronger now  line in my head every time I do a push up since I was like 11.
atleast that gotg game was good
tomp rider 3 was good but new days I am more in to games where I can make my own story like mass effect dragon age and witcher games whete choices have cons
how about a politically correct tomb raider   game starts with lara in jail for cultural appropriation from raiding tombs of people that aren t like her they him it or whatever. since there isn t any differences between the sexes  she finds herself in a unisex jail . the totourial part of the game consist of a unwinnable fight  which lara ends up a pregnant person....out on bond she cant go home cause daddy government liberated it from her for the benefit of the state. now as a pregnant urban outdoor dweller her story begins...with her on the corner getting pimpsmacked by a dude named upgrade and side kick pookie. ....................I dont know what the h3ll im talking about. makes as much sense as liberalism.     more weebs for the weeb throne!!!!!
funny how feminists in order to make strong female characters they basically made them have all the aspects of being  manly  lol  its seemingly real hard to make a good female character who actually asks as a woman  its not hard btw
quite enjoy the content  mel.  I will offer a kind critique.  you spent more time on tomb raider than on what your video title was.  feel free to do this as you like   just be aware thatsomeone might view it as a bait and switch.  I dont think that you got off topic on purpose  you just gravitated toward what one of your most passionate interests is.  just food for thought.
a 2022 lense has no business being applied to a timeless tale like lotr...it immediately dates it  like flip phones and mullets. worse  the context of the times in which original works were created is lost. can you imagine if twitter existed in the 90s  half of us could be cancelled for speach that was common at that time. lotr is timeless and doesnt need to be  fixed . rings of power will be cheap  2022 fanfic. I hope the 1.8m downvotes on the trailer is true
chuck dixon  what great name!
abomination is the nice word for it...it has over 2 million dislikes now...Im happy because they way they treat the lore and are calling tolkien a racist and say he wrote his story wrong...nah stop trashing his lore of the story all for your agenda...
and he s not wrong.
Christ is what matters most. everything else is secondary.
am I the only one here who wants to enjoy the story and the gameplay  the answer here isn t  less storytelling more gameplay   its to expect these billion dollar corporations to provide us with a good experience in both areas when we give them our money. to say that video games aren t about storytelling is to disregard some of the best games that have been made.maybe Im too much of an rpg gamer  but I expect both gameplay and storytelling to be strong if Im going to give a company my money. they are not mutually exclusive concepts.
my man chuck rules.
make chuck the president of that company immediately  we need normal people doing the final ok . these snowflakes like to twist facts and words  boom!
when shows are all woke  its like they all have the same script. which makes it extremely boring.
tomb raider is my life  this is just how it is lol
@melonie mac go boom  I know the feeling.  I love sword and sorcery  which is distinct from fantasy   so I understand  d
hopefully in a few years it will be just as irrelevant as ghostbusters 2016.
the article didn t mention it but he also adapted the hobbit into graphic novel form so he knows his stuff on this topic.
hey melonie I just want to say that I do not think that the writer for batman comics know what he is really talking bout and also I do not think that he has never seen the lotr  Lord of the rings  series ever to know what the rop  ring of power  series is going to be about either this year. anyway I just want to say that he needs to watch the lotr  Lord of the rings  series to know what the rop  ring of power  is going to be bout after he watch the Lord of the rings series  ok melonie. anyway I hope you understand what I am saying to you on this topic  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed day and evening at home with your pets   have a good night too  ok melonie.
awesome boom
I have tried to get into the Lord of the rings and I cant I just get to bored to death while watching it
just so you know   zight-guy-st
crystal dynamics  can shut up! until we see more legacy of kain... so we can enjoy both raziel and kain once again lolz

just wait they will come out with some crap saying she was searching for her inner self and that is because shes been a repressed gay all along......
enjoyed the batman  but when catwoman said something about  huwhite privilege  my eyes rolled to the back of my head to where I couldn t see the rest of the movie. just listened in darkness
ostracize
great vid  but honestly  Im a tolkienist  and I feel kinda punk d.
these are the times that try men s souls. the age of wokeism must end.
nice love you
thank youuuu
pronouncing the z as  ts  gets you extra points
thank you!
@melonie mac go boom  happy to help! love your channel  keep it up!
fun fact   this is no longer a new channel
this is the most aggressively unintelligent youtube channel.
everything woke turns to shit.  donald j. trumpI cant wait to watch the series fail.
rings of power tv series is going to crash and burn before its even begun. Im not going to be watching this trash on amazon prime. I d rather watch the extended editions to peter jackson s lotr instead. lol
I thought  the batman  was pretty meh  and Im not really excited for any sequels.
I on the other will say there is something wrong with interactive movies rather than videogames. they take a lot of resources to make  a lot of time and imo feel like failed hollywood scripts. if your focus is narrative storytelling  read a book  watch a film or show. interactive movies are lame and lazy to me. no thanks.
race swapping characters is pretty racist actually  sanford   sons didn t need to do that those characters already were black and thatshow was loved by all audiences.
lotr show will suck
ukraine is already out of style  thanks will smith. I cant wait for wokeness to be gone as well. just think about all the future commentary talking about how awful every single movie and tv show is from this era. its gonna be hilarious. what will old wokies be like I wonder  zoomer to boomer in 2 years lol.
first
zz eye t guy st
seriously  put a damn shirt on.
sanord and son is not  perhaps  the best example  because it is based on a bbc  uk  sitcom  steptoe and son  where the characters were white.
sanford damn it!  why the hell did I turn on autocorrect
hooray!!!
Im wearing a tank top  is that offensive or something  considering in a lot of my videos I wear a sports bra  I wore more today and now you complain !
