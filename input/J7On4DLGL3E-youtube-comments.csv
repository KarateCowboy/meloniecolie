literally the only person she s ever flirted with throughout the entire series was luka how is itsurprising thats she s straight
a strong female character  comfortable with her body  feminine in the way she dresses   moves. they looked at all that combined and immediately assumed lesbian for their fanfiction   lewd art. these are the same people that look at two guys who are best friends as being gay. this is homosexual fetishization.
they used to condescendingly say to us  not everyone is straight  now we are at the point where we need to even more condescendingly say  not everyone is gay
exactly. luka is literally the only person bayonetta has ever flirted with. people that assumed there was a thing between her and jeanne are seriously messed up. jeanne is like a sister to bayo and they were roommates for a time. apparently having a roommate the same gender makes it gay  they re just mad their fantasy headcanon was shattered by the actual source material.
as a gay man seeing bayonetta finally kiss luka was fricken beautiful
she has literally never ever  even once.... hinted at being lesbian. she poses in bottom positions  she dances on poles and other japanese folks metaphors for male parts. and if the fans out there want blatant actions as proof. she literally only spends legit time flirting and showing interest with one person and thats luka. like... how on earth! !  did anyone!!! think bayo was not straight  ! !! ! ! ! the entire game hints at her wild side and interest in  riding
how dare she kiss a dude this is a prime example where straight people take everything from us
joel stupidly bumbles into getting himself killed in tlou2   totally understandable he was softened by years of constant fighting bayonetta kisses a guy   character assassination!
she kissed a dude  and she liked it  her real fanbase sure liked itglad to see they kept her exactly as she was in the first 2 games.
luka s always been significant in the series. he was there when his father found and freed bayonetta from her magical sleep  has the skills to track her down even when she s in another dimension  and he s often a source of knowledge. he s always helping out bayonetta however he can  and he did nearly all of it without powers.
in the first game  bayonetta said   do I look like I have any interest in children  now making them  thats another story.  either she was interested in men  or she was interested in others engaging in the act  or both lol.
they have gone full circle. bayonneta was far too sexualized  then turn into an empowerement symbold for woman  then she became a positive view of sexuality. now  she s bad because she s straight  because she s sexualized incorrectly. full damn circle.
how dare she have her own sexual preferences - the sheer audacity!
Im so lost with this  first she was bad because she s half naked or something. then she s empowering  now bad again because she s not gay  funny thing is the creator said way back when that he just wants a sexy hot girl in his game because he likes it no deeper reason then guy likes hot girl shocker
I didn t know humans could reach this level of narcissism.
I know how dare bayonetta s sexual preference match 98  of the global population
its pretty obvious from the prior two games thatshe was interested in the opposite sex. Im not sure why these individuals always feel they need self inserts of themselves in games or media to identify with a character  but I never needed too.
Im a super bayonetta fan  I can imagine thatsomeone who only pays surface level attention to the story cantalk themselves into imagining bayo to be gae. since bayo was imagined as a female counterpart to dmc certain character archetypes carried over but often genderswapped.  e.g.  bayo s business partner is a clumsy  mafia man instead of a bombshell blonde but their relationship is completely devoid of sexual tension  on the other hand  her rival is another witch and thus every time they meet sexuality is in the air.and this is the trick here  sexual imagery isn t necessarily tied to mating desire in the series as all witches - especially bayo - use sexual motifs as a form of taunting.there is a point in the first game where a new angel enemy type takes the form of bayonetta. this ends up in us witnessing a scene of two bayonettas aggressively and very sexually dancing at each other.  however if one pays a little attention to the game instead of treating it as shallow one will realise that there is no  queer-coding  mating desire in this scene - it is more like seeing two silverback gorillas beat their chest at eachoter before fist comes to face.what enrages me about this is that this is very cleverly used in the first game s  romance plot to convey the relationship between bayo and luka. luka - a womanizer - starts off standoffish against bayo  but bayo not only doesnt engage him as a rival  she injects sexuality into their scenes as a form of showing control and disarming the guy. she isn t just more powerful  she also controls the mood and tone of their relationship with her femininity.  and if one pays attention it is quite easy to see that bayo holds back. despite being able to control everything 100  she always remains in an arm s reach from the guy  always just teasing enough as to motivate him to chase her. and as we get close to the end of the game and through various twists and turns they become partners we witness how this dynamic changes  luka becomes the one with sexual energy - not by showing himself off but by always eating her up with his eyes - while bayo becomes something we ve never seen her as  casual.the first time we see these two the guy who charms girls left and right is seething with hatred while the girl who always keeps up the mask of sexy-dancing enemies and uncomfortable situations away is kinda just teasing him. and as the endgame starts  helicopter scene  we see the guy staring his eyes out at a drop of water inching down the girl s breast while the girl for the first time ever just sits back comfortable and without exaggarated sexual threats shows a bit of weakness.I honestly think it is a very clever way to play around with the idea of sexual dynamics and results in one of the best romances ever portrayed in a video game.luka and bayo are meant for each other. because luka is the one person bayo can be something more than sexual with -  intimate.I understand those who want to imagine her with girls  but her kissing anyone else would be the character assassination.
a straight woman protagonist     impossible
bayonetta to me  is the woman equivalent of the 80 s action dudes. they were olympian buff  kicked all the ass  had all the guns  cars  women and lifestyles that a man could want.bayonetta is beautiful  sexy  confident  elaborately dressed  isn t afraid of her body  kicks all sorts of ass  has all the dudes admiring her  has all the guns  is over the top in everything she does  caring  stands out and has fun even in dire situations. I can never accurately guess what a woman wants but I will say the success of the bayonetta franchise is an indication of how some women  at least the ones I interact with  wish to present themselves.
thats why the people saying this aren t fans of the game.
exactly luka has been bayonetta s interest since the very beginning.
every cutscene they are in she does nothing but tease the fuck out of him. she made it clear she likes him.
how many almost kisses have they already had!  dafuq!
youre  assuming these people have played the other games
but but but but jeanne! d  - those people  probably
I used to have a woke friend.  ew  and how seriously they took head canons was annoying af.  oh link must be non binary   omg she was blushing in the same room as the other girl she must be gay  and anything that either proved wrong or went against the head canon actually annoyed them. calm tf down.
these are people who make up their own headcanons and treat it as fact. have you seen the genshin impact community  they freak out at the mere idea that any of the characters in the game might be straight.
I got reeeed at by some dude cuz I pointed that very thing out. these people need help
@nick b  when activism replaces personality

yep.  same people who think sam and frodo are gay.  platonic relationships dont exist in their world.
funny you say that because the first game they were all against bayonetta because she was just a sex symbol for the male gaze. now its the fucking opposite and they re surprised thatstraight men love her  da fuck is wrong with current culture
these are the same people that look at two guys who are best friends as being gay.  this feels way too relatable for me hell I just know how to be loyal to my guy friends like I had 2 one of which was my cousin but eh and I with both my cousin and my best friend   we were like brothers.and most of my middleschool girl classmates and my sister automatically assumed we re gay
damn right!
@majora  these people are insane is why.
@thesexman  ugh
Imean. she teases and is flirty to evreryone and anything. but she doesnt beat the shit out if him. thats the only difference xd
its not even a secret about her being straight! if you go on the second game and look at her cop outfitsays thatshe s straight! read the description of it
they wanted her to be a lesbian sooo badly.
simple. most of the people that complain about this stuff are those that have likely never bought and played a bayonetta game before  and just know and idolize the character because of all the fanart they see on the internet. my guess on how this started is thatsince obsessive shippers have been making bayo jeanne lesbian fanart for a long time  then these people  that dont play the games  looked at this fanart  assumed thats how it was in the games  and it was the only thing they cared about.this was a nice dose of reality for these people. they clearly needed it.no one who s an actual fan of the series  instead of just a fanart poser   and played the previous games  was  surprised  about this lol.
because they obviously dont understand what flirting is..  she never came off as bI etc queer to me ever in any of the games
gay people dont even play these games fam they just self insert into the script.
@nick b  dude wtf  how did you ever get a woke friend. good God
@michael smith  exactly
@phaerroh  sounds about right...
@broke nousagi  thats sad af
@sharavy  honestly to me it was just silly flirting  not in a love interest way. even I thought them being together was weird they dont really have any chemistry
@broke nousagi  it is pretty funny tbh. Imean I follow itsome times to just roll my eyes and laugh. its even funnier to watch them melt down when new characters are released and they re  too white . like no shit its a chinese company  the only way they wouldn t be is if they were tanned and they throw a shit fit if someone draws the tanned characters any lighter even though its canonically just a tan.
facts
@broke nousagi  as a fan of the game I can confirm that the majority of the community is like that. not me tho lol
@nihonguy  I wonder if theyve played bullet witch  ghost rider  nier automata  nier replicant  kamen rider memories of heroez  dmc5 and oneechanbara z2 chaos
@broke nousagi  hilarious considering its a chinese made game. so delusional they are
@phaerroh  childhood friend and rival that literally tried to shoot you in the face while trying to run you over with her motorcycle in the first game----clearly lovers! lol
@budgie cat  id be shocked if they heard of half those
she freaking called him chesire  which the name of her stuffed cat as a kid thatshe thought was cute.
@nihonguy  even if they did they would pretend not to care or deem them irellevant
@budgie cat  ghost rider has a game
@zzodysseus zz  yes lol. he had a game based off the first marvel movie which came out on ps2 and psp and even the gba.  it was modeled after devil may cry and God of war with some on rails motorcycle missions to break up monotony. actually not a bad game it does the gow dmc impersonations quite well  the flaws come in the motorcycle segments and overall generic lack of story presentation.nicholas cage wasnt in the game though because 2k said in order for him to voice the game and provide his likeness  it would have cost them.....1 million dollars
thank you
Imean bayonetta had a really close relationship with jeanne  I wouldn t hazard her developing a romantic relationship with jeanne  but there is nothing disqualifying a possible relationship with luka. also they can argue thatsince bayonetta 3 plays with multiverse dynamics  among other things I wont spoil happening  nothing says she isn t dating jeanne.
thank you...from the very first game it was evident she had something for luca
@nick b  exactly this. they cant separate their desires from reality.
there s also an article I read saying this game made bayonetta a shell of her former self cuz it made her weak and in need of help and a man... like have they played the other 2 fcking games  bayonetta is strong but she always faces entities stronger than herself she has needed help and rescuing even before the third game so Im like ...       what the hell are u talking about thatshe has never needed help or rescuing in 1 she gets saved by jeanne... in second she gets saved by her father... and in third well she gets saved by someone else but it happens  like people this delusional piss me off
@broke nousagi  genshin impact fan here. proud benefischl shipper. yeah. we know. its always the gay shoppers that are more annoying than straight shippers.
@phasehawk  that tells a lot already.
@david_ mysterium   maybe you ll finally be able to cuff the man of your dreams . fair enough.
@ihatetheheat !  nah  they do in the first game. in the second game it feels slapstick. ok  not saying the writing is great  but the choice makes more sense than jeanne. you dont ship rivals  man. thats like shipping dante and vergil.  a little less sus that this example  but still
it was always luka
me   Im ultra straight guy and I like girls  not men. men are just my brotherhoodthose people   what ! youre a bigot if you dont love everything!me   I just told you Im straight  not gay. so if I were to love everything then that means I just love anything even if its bad  criminals  toilet poo and etc.those people   reeeeee! a bigottttt!
@phaerroh  which would be weird because she never actually flirts with jeanne
@hector  lol she always loved luka the cereza of the little one grew up watching over luka!
@donna dash  jeanne was her rival or peer  and in fact she was a minor antagonist in bayo 1. another reason I hate bayo 2 because it insinuated that bayonetta and jeanne are lesbian couples  when they were never were. she only saved jeanne because she was the last witch alive. bayo 3 introduces more surviving witches in the multiverse.
@timmytimmy mit  Im bayonetta 1 they re rivals friends in bayonetta 2 they never implied thatshe flirts with everyone thats just what bayonetta does with everyone and even if she was gay in that game it doesnt matter. she saves jeanne cause thats her friend. 3 bayonetta 3 is back to 1 witch or 2 with jeanne. idk what everyone think she s lgbtq because she s not.
youre right  but let s be honest. bayonetta is bI or pansexual
@se or lobo no at the moment she isn t.
they live in a twitter safespace bubble.you can make a dumb post like  peach is such a lesbian queen  and get 10k likes in a day
kamiya said previously thatshe didn t have feelings for him
@janky n8  Im gay and Ive played them all. 75  of the bayo fans Ive met are also lgbt
I dont know I always thought luca was the friend that was always getting  save not the love interest. like they play it very ambiguous the entire series.
@sharavy   yeah but doesnt she do that with literally everything she encounters.   I feel like the way she treats joanne is a lot different.   plus hes not in a lot of cut scenes in the 2nd game.
@emil carter  then why yall tryin to gay wash byonetta  just enjoy the source material
@janky n8  kamiya said she s bI so why are you trying to straight wash her
@janky n8  velma has been bI since mystery inc and tbh idc about thatshow. there are many different versions so it doesnt matter and you literally still have almost every character in media. luka was never set up as a love interest so it came out of nowhere and felt forced just like viola as a whole felt forced. also if you intentionally mistype lgbtq as lgbbq to use the community as a joke it makes you look like a bigot. might wanna edit that
I saw this on the different videos and even though this is the exact quotes itstill has the same idea  they want us to show emotion but whenever we do it could be considered gay.
@zahir 101    seriously
its the same bs thatstranger things is hinting at doing with will. his arch was that he s growing up akward shy and hard for him to leave his childhood behind. like not knowing how to talk to girls or express himself with fear of being laughed at. its a good premise but nah lets just be lazy and make him a gay character.yeah cause guys cant be socially akward unless they re gay. its not confirmed but we all know its going that route.
@nenecitosart  that legitimately pisses me off
@majora  so Godamn agree.
you mean the type that forced saint and osiris to be gays. drift to be a gay. blake and yang to be gay. etc etc etc.
@zero todona  bungie made so many characters gay in the destiny 2 lore tabs that Im surprised if anyone is straight anymore. I have fun playing  but the heavy focus on npc sexuality is just irrelevant to anything else story wise.
@zero todona  to be fair  yang and blake haven t been confirmed to be together yet and blake has actually been confirmed to be bisexual while yang s sexuality hasn t actually been confirmed yet. but yeah  pretty much.
@eddielombardo  indeed
they also have fanfic fetishizing the winchester brothers from supernatural as a gay couple! the fact that they are literally siblings isn t enough evidence to stop their fetish
@al m  indeed
@nenecitosart  thats exactly what I took from the recent season. I knew they were trying to go this route. i.was hoping I was wrong. at least if ur going to create a gay character  then make itso that character is just gay  and not secretly gay. I hate thatsht.because it gives them excuses to change characters mindsets mid way through viewing the character. they could just make a gay character  not make a character gay. I hate that way of thinking.
@majora  its the soy intake
@yt1300mf  often they ll see two asian girls walking holding hands and assume theyre gay when in that culture its a just a sign of platonic friendship lol
@thesexman  I remember that  they also tried boycotting her because of it  and like the current  failed boycott  that failed also and people still bought the game
agreed this needs to stop for real
@patrick jennings  it wont stop. social media is these weirdos safe spaces to cope  and reee lol
@budgie cat  well then they re not going to be happy now that elon musk has offcially bought twitter
american
well said
no we re not in the same group. as a fujoshI  I testify this. definitely not in the same interest group.
@molly h. johns  the problem is people making demands   throwing tantrums because their headcanon isn t canon.
these people would have a field day in saudI arabia.men holding hands everywere...
this people base yourself and the world on stereotypes. because she acts in a certain way she must be queer. they literally base all their life on stereotypes and get mad when they are broken lol.
@yt1300mf  people think that !
thank you she was never a gay icon bayonetta was created by a heterosexual man! bayonetta is bisexual. we dont want to anger the lgbtq fans.
this
yeah  its always been that as far as I cantell.
nah
and these are the same people that insist that they have no problem with straight men and masculinity.
@zero todona  whoa whoa whoa! blake and yang are gay! ! ! !
true and its so funny.
@majora  what would they think of people who play dead or alive xtreme beach volleyball for its  amazing volleyball gameplay  then
no. she had stirng chemistry with jeanne and kamiya previously stated she and jeanne were a couple in polls regarding couples in his franchises because the platinum split
yeah the dumb fujoshis    fudanshI  s
@janky n8  who said Im trying to cancel someone  the only people who get cancelled are the ones who spout racist  homophobic  or antiemetic nonsense. when it comes to matters regarding human rights its not a matter of opinion anymore. if you aren t being bigoted  youre all good in my book.
@jack jacques  you took the words right out of my mouth
@janky n8  right
@blackster  wrong. I have evidence to support my claims and he doesnt
literally the only reason bayonetta doesnt make her move is because she lives far longer than luka thats the reason they aren t together also people confuse this bayonetta with the little one this is the exact same bayonetta legit the sake exact one he s been talking to from day 1
yep. she was very clear in bayo 1
@mr mxyzptlk  yo! youread my thoughts
she s flirted with most of the enemies what are you on lmao.
eh...she could still be bi.
@hector  I wouldn t go that far. their was just a playful relationship not an actual interest.   kamiya has teased jeanne and bayonetta many times throughout the over decade long series. also you guys all say your fans but bayonetta 3 literally stars little cereza from the first game. she never even experienced the events from 1 and the exact events from 2. the witch with discerning eyes is the bayonetta who experienced the events of both 1 and 2 making her our bayo. so its likely she is either single or in a long time relationship with jeanne.
and its not forced another version of luka and bayoneta had viola than viola went to another universe to meet another bayo  cereza and another version of luka   and even in that universe they fell in lovekamiya commentary during the time span of bayo 1 already hinted luka x bayoneta bayoneta said it directly to luka  I dont like kids    but making them is a different story
