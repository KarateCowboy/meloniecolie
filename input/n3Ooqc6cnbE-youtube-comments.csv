apparently youre a good egg  whatever that means   anyway  jeremy said youre worth giving a chance so  subbed.
hey melonie! I saw the shoutout from jeremy of the quatering but I also remember you from back when you hosted gamestop tv! as a former gamestop employee who is also female of traditional Christian values I totally want to support your channel! you go girl!!!!!!!
here because of jeremy. got your back  will be following and subbed. I would like a woman s perspective on culture stuff without getting yelled at for being a straight  white man.
admire you so much for speaking out about this type of stuff  never have been a fan of cancel culture and at this point its getting way too ridiculous
the quartering sent me over to youre channel.  standby your convictions and principles and never bow to the woke crowd as they have none.  be you.  God bless.
enjoyed your interview with jay yesterday on  welcome to the rebellion . this modern day witch hunting had to stop.
a new subscriber from the quartering.you can do this melanie.  you have an ocean of subscribers coming your way.capitalize on it
just came from  the quartering  - jeez these people are nuts.  sorry you have to deal with all this bs and good luck fighting the intellectual midgets.
gotta love the witch hunters that track down everything that happened in the past. imagine if the tables were turned and we took a look in their past.
the quartering said you might need some backup with these woke clowns coming after you .you are a breath of fresh air and exactly what I look for from a commentator .never bend that knee to those woke blue haired land whales . your people got your back like a buttcrack
jeremy is a good egg who backs his friends  and I back jeremy and his friends  especially against the wokester mob. but I also like what youre about  well  the gaming and Jesus parts  not so sure about the fitness. but as meatloaf said  2 out of 3 ain t bad.   and you obviously have the chops to make this video thing work  so Im here for it.
jeremy sent me - the only way to stop this is to hold them up to their own standards. b c Im sure they all shared lyrics or outright said it when they were young and thought it was  cool and edgy.
found you from jeremy s channel  looking forward to hearing your insights   opinions!  about his vid featuring you  I love lara croft  lollipop chainsaw  etc. Ive been accused of  internalized patriarchy . cant we just be allowed to like things without being judged   just shows how little there is to complain about us if thats the hill they want us to die on.
hey there! jeremey from the quartering sent me this way. believe me when I say that there are more main stream normies out here than there are of the cancel colture mob. you have indicated that you are a Christian  which also helps.   I encourage you to build this channel. make it a new start. post often  post from the heart.  be as innocent as a lamb  and as wise as an adder!   good luck! subscribed and all alerts on.
the quartering sent me Im here to show my support!! sorry to hear about they did to you  this  cancel culture  is  cancer to our culture  I hate hearing this b s. good luck on your new channel and you got people here.
kudos to you! more should show their support for people  like joe and ashnI  who are going through rough times. it can feel so isolating when you think the whole world is against you  because all you can hear are the voices of those who want to bring you down.
here from the quartering shout-out.  excited to hear your take on things.  good luck to you and your channel.also  definitely agree with you on this.  its truly getting out of hand at this point. sad to watch.
listened to you on the quartering  and it only took 10 seconds of listening you before I knew you were fucking amazing. go out and cut out your part of the world melonie  you fucking got this!
always been a huge fan for many years! youre a great person  you ll  obviously  always have haters who are jealous or angry because you go against the grain. never give in  just keep being you. please take care  and I wish you the best!
first time I heard of you  its a damn shame for that.  let s hope that this new path goes greatly for you!itseems that a lot of people came after watching the quartering video  dgotta join your subscribers!
first time seeing hearing about her! I just binged a good amount of her content. she s definitely a good egg! sucks about gamestop but she is probably better off I stopped supporting that company in any way years ago.. pretty crap company the way they treat employees and woke agenda. I think she will be better off with having the extra time to focus on her channel s . I am a rather small gaming creator myself  with really low quality vids lol also dont think I could handle the anxiety of it doing well  so I kinda gave up  anyway  Im sure she will do very well from what Ive seen! I ll definitely be giving her my support! looking forward to seeing more of her content and conversations!
yes  soooo  a good egg is the opposite of a bad egg.  thats what it means.
a good egg means if you eat it you wont be sick........sips from blue mug
same  I wana see this utter disdain for aliens lmao tatakae... tatakae...
amen.
same. I like to support anyone the looneys try to cancel.
same
good egg  maybe something to do with being equally yoked  or cut from the same cloth  either way keep-on-keeping-on     jeremy sent me btw that bearded gruff!
came by way of jeremy. Im a new sub let s watch your channel take off and go. best to you.
good kind of id politics!
ditto! plus anyone the cancel crowd are after is worth checking out at the very least
jeremy brought me here
agreed!
you should check out lauren chen also has some great perspective!
me too!you go girl! the melonie army is here.
jeremy backed you and I side with him about how the cancel culture is not good for anyone.
@cheeseburger cake  oh I already follow her  and sidney watson.
@trashdiscourse     dont forget lauren chen too!
he also said she was better looking than him which is true but not much of a compliment.
@cheeseburger cake  I never do. nor sidney watson
the quartering sent me too.
same here enjoying the content so far!
its getting crazy.
not to take away from this girl  but sydney watson is another good choice for female perspective
100
as long as there s someone out there who thrives over destroying others...it likely wont.
its important for others to reply to comments in videos so the algorithm will help promote new channels.
those who virtue signal the loudest usually have the wooorst of skeletons in their closets
@melonie mac go boom   this is wrong! take a look at this! no  on this person! not me! them!
@melonie mac go boom  just subbed after seeing the quartering talk about the woke mob coming after you  hope you do more content..
they have whole graveyards..
@patrick henry  and they re smelling up the place.
sometimes I wonder if that would be a good idea. a lot of people seem comfortable with terrible behaviour because they never faced the consequences. this just demonstrates that there is no redemption with woke culture. slip up once in your life and that can be used against you if someone doesnt like something you ve said and want to be vindictive about it. it also shows why anonymity is important  especially when youre young.
@melonie mac go boom  saw you on chrissie mayr s channel. you are awesome!keep fighting the good fight girl
@smellyfinger  when you build a following out of hatred instead of truth  no good can come out of it.
I go back and forth on this  I think I get what you mean  but ultimately the people who tried to hurt us and ours for not being perfect will end up with clean slates -- because anyone who isn t in the cult recognize pencils have erasers.  I think in the end we  win  by forgiving them and bringing them back into the fold  its the hardest part about this whole thing  if we lose  we get punished  but if we win  the losers get to be loved again.
@nebohtes  I hear you  but Im past that. Im not forgiving those who only have bitter evil in their hearts. they do this to destroy lives. if they wanted to change behavior they wouldn t go to peoples employers to get them fired from their jobs. they dont deserve a pass for that.
@raggmopp 3377  but I can get a pass for drunk driving  or dumping my girlfriend for a girl I thought was better looking  or treating my brother like shit for ten years because nobody could stop me  if Imade a list it d go on for days -- Ive hurt a lot of people  Ive done plenty of damage  but people forgave me and it changed me from a bitter  hateful  angry thing into a -- person.  I see people that are hurt and hurting  and I want them to get clear of it.  they re not even breaking the law  but they deserve to be punished forever for being wrong   isn t that what they do
@nebohtes  non sequitur....none of that involves contacting your employer to fire you. besides  the left never forgives. and if there is no hope of redemption  why bother trying to improve yourself
@raggmopp 3377  shirley -- my point is exactly that.  you said never forgive these people  so what incentive is there for them to change
@nebohtes  pffft! we ve been doing that  forgiving them  forever. what you are saying is essentially   yes  your husband is beating you  but you must forgive him even though you know he ll do it again and again until youre dead.  iows  a suicide pact. time to try something else.
@nebohtes  know what - fine. I ll forgive them. and then I ll still cut them out of my life. b c forgiving them isn t for them - its for me. but I ll still refuse to fellowship with them b c I dont have a death-wise. and thats how everybody should deal with them.
judging by this video  jeremy was right about you being a sensible and good person. subbed
my advice  never feel sorry  guilty or apologize to random strangers under any circumstances.feelings of guilt and feeling sorry is something you do towards people you actually care about  like family  friends and loved ones. those are the kind of people you should apologize to when you ve said something bad  because they actually matter to you in your day to day life.some random member of a twitter mob however is futile to apologize to  because it will always be insincere anyway. nobody really feels sorry when they said something that offended people in public anyway. they only feel panic because they got found out and they re worried about losing clout or a job.so seriously  never bother with saying youre sorry to random strangers on the internet. especially not to leftwingers  because they dont view apologies as a means of reconciliation. they view apologies as justification for being absolutely terrible towards you.if yourefuse to apologize  they ll still be terrible. but not with as much gusto  because they can see that it doesnt have any effect on you.
hImelonie  new sub here. jeremy @thequartering sent me over to check out your channel.Im liking your content so far  dont let the woke mob drag you down darlin. live free or die.edit  love the tats btw
just started watching you and I already love your content. merging modern topics with Christian ideals. nice to know that Im not the only one.
subbed and liked to help your channel grow  because of the simple principle of anti-cancel culture.but Im also interested in seeing what youre about  so sticking around after jeremy s recommendation.best of luck to you  and Im excited to see what kind of content you ll be dishing out!
cant wait to see your channel blow up in the faces of those thatsought to cancel you
like and comment for engagement. looking forward to more content from you.edit  you are darn right  its long past time to stand up to the mob. they only have the power when we give it to them. its time to stop apologizing. stop bending the knee and stop playing by their rules. they dont get to decide what is  right  or what is  good . they are just as flawed as the next person. its time to stand up to them and no longer allow the vocal minority to speak for the silent majority.
Im so sorry for what these woke prcks have done to you  quatering sent me. subscribed
that type of person seems to be unhappy and always look for a reason to ruin someone else. the mob does not care about an apology they just want to hurt others. keep up the great videos.
just finnished watching listening  and got to say I really enjoyed this!loving your attitude  you go  rebel!and if Im not mistaken you just talked for almost 18 minutes straight without cuts and editing  and still didn t feel stretched out. it felt natural and genuine  thumbs up! maybe Im just enjoying longer videos more than before  but I felt it was worth mentioning.
bump  bump! this channel is gonna light off! the big q sent me and I am here for the support! loving the community so far!
its nice hearing somebody that has logic and by the way jeremy says hi
I dropped by because jeremy requested it  but I stayed because your videos are engaging. subbed. I hope you take jeremy s advice and post more content.
you are so right about the woke expecting everyone to be perfect in all respects and to be cookie-cutter replicas of this supposed perfection. even if it did work like they want  what a boring friggin world that would be!! that is not a world I would enjoy. it is the imperfections in each of us that make us unique. it is our past successes and failures that have made each of us who we are today. celebrate the fact that you are not perfect  and imperfect you is the only you in the world.
sent here by jeremy. the cancel mod is the modern day version of a lynch mob. they appear to want to destroy a person s reputation and livelihood. facts or intent meant nothing to them. they are just horrible human beings that wish to cause harm.
jeremy talked very good about you and your content so Im here to give you my support. not disappointed at all keep up the great work.
you get my support. continue and rise up to a positive platform. I believe in you
great video! Im so glad the quartering recommended you. your perspective was very wise and down to earth which is very refreshing. I cant wait to see more of your social commentary.
the quaterpoundering sent me over. not disappointed. you seem like a lovely young lady with a voice and important things to say. keep it up! you ve got a growing audience who want to hear what you have to say. we re here to listen and give support. you seem granted from what little I saw like you have a great personality  let itshine and this channel will grow if you keep up with the uploads. Ive already been to long winded. you gained a sub  I personally cant wait to see where you take this channel. good luck.
hell ya you go girl  stand up to the mob. here from the quartering and now subscribed!
great narration and story telling.  very expressive  plenty of moxie   and damn easy on the eyes.  got my sub!
we have to support those who are brave enough to use their voice to call out the bullshit. keep fighting the good fight. subbed.
came over from jeremy s channel.  I was going to support this girl who got cancelled for absolutely nothing but she s apologizing and submitting to the mob when she did nothing wrong
I really hope she has seen this video because what you just did is all it takes to help someone get through something like this. people love to get off feeling superior to others and have no regard for the emotional sanity of others. God bless you for being a voice that will speak out against these types of injustices.
judge and you will be judged because not one of us is righteous. great message! subscribed! really looking forward to where your channel is going.  full support
this is the mel that I am the biggest fan of. real  raw  uncensored and honest. 2 for 2 on the content. keep it up
never heard of you before today  but a person that the quartering give a shoot out to is a good person in my book  Im subscribing...
loving this channel melonie. nice to see someone with as big of a following as you willing to say the things youre saying. I feel like a lot of people with a big social media presence wont even touch on some of these topics.
a word is a word  if you let a word break you  you were broken to begin with. thanks for doing this mel. what youre doing here is culture shifting- I love it. instead of dog piling  or even just making a video to laugh at the left eating the left  youre stepping forward with compassion. this is what we need- its not about winning  or cancelling    its about learning from our mistakes and moving forward  together.    the cancel mob thinks they know best  but we believe we can do better than we did yesterday.
Im here because of your interview with chrissie. liked your perspective about getting hate just because youre new then eventually winning over fans. never considered that. I also sense you ve got a good  yet tough heart. thats going to be important. I hope you grow as a content creator and expand your talents. please hold onto your faith
you have some good people behind you and promoting you like jay and jeremy. wishing you nothing but the best. welcome to the rebellion.
melonie I have been watching you in video game media for damn near a decade now. you ve got a view like for every video.  good luck with the channel and keep the content coming!
love your new channel and the direction youre taking!
jeremy from the quartering sent me.  a person should never get fired just because of who they re friends with. we ve got your back!
never watched gamestop and not heard of you before  but if jeremy says youre worth listening too Im happy to offer my subscription and see what you have to say. good luck with this channel looking forward to the comtent
what blows my mind  is how  people target anyone for using the lyrics  but never target the person who writes the lyrics.
I have been binging your content since I heard about you through jeremy. Im really glad you are speaking out and I am glad to have another person speaking for logic on the internet. I also enjoyed you sharing a verse on the first video. I think it would be neat if you did that at the end of every episode. that way it is totally skipable for those who dont want it and its there for those who do. best of luck to you!
the quartering sends his regards!  Ive enjoyed the two videos so far.  it is very important to show support and allow for a path to redemption.  it could be this video that convinces someone or ashnI herself to leave the woke cult.  ya never know.
I understand so well how others attack you to make them feel stronger or better its ridiculous
hImelonie! came over to check your content based on jeremy of the quartering recommendation. I like what I hear so I have subscribed. the company this lady worked for sure caved fast. a disgusting display of cowardice. hope to hear more from you
melonie! ive been following you for years  im happy you made this channel! happy to support.
Im here because another youtuber that I respect vouched for you.  I dont know you but youre in good company!  good luck with the new channel!
Im going to be completely honest here.  I stumbled upon her channel a couple of months ago.  I noticed the  kool-aid hair  thatseems to signify wokeism but I still watched her content.  she actually has really good ideas and thoughts on how to grow your channel so I subscribed to her.  my point is that we should all give people a try and listen to what they have to say.  judge them by their fruit.  its awful to hear that the woke mob turned against her.  they sure love to eat their own dont they   I pray thatshe leaves all of this behind and moves on like this never occurred.  when one door closes  another shall open... if you seek it.
I forgot about her but remember seeing some of her videos and she came off as a really nice person. I just hate how people cant be decent to each other and they always want to find something to complain about.
stand strong and dont let them stop your work.  yo will do with the silent mayority  for it isn t woke or weird like them haters.just look at how many of us came here from jeremy s channel.
Ive seen some of her tweets  she wasn t just woke she was crazy woke. she got eaten by the sharks she swims with  kinda poetic. its hard to have sympathy for ppl that do that. love the channel btw
the quartering pointed me this way and Im glad he did. thank you for speaking out. looking foreward to hearing more.  kicks in the sub button
I cant tell you how often Ive lost friends because I refused to bow my knee to the mob  its meh at this point. if they want to live in their echo chamber that is their choice  personally I dont want to live in an echo chamber  I want people to challenge me and my positions.
there was nothing wrong with what she posted. she simply violated a  future  bs social taboo. historians are going to have a fun time dissecting this period of history in 100 years. no doubt they will have wildly different social norms  just like we do compared to our great grandparents. looking forward to the videos.
never apologize for something you dont think was the wrong thing to donever apologize to anyone who has no desire or intent to like you in the first place.and in my opinion  never apologize for what you think should be considered acceptable behavior  even if its currently considered unacceptable.  but that one s up to you.
great new channel  melonie!  looking forward to seeing what you do with it!
melonie thank you for bringing this topicout Ive haven t herd this before.I totally agree with you.none of us are perfect the only person was perfect was Jesus .again thank you for bringing this out its messed up sounds to me censor ship.your the best melonie
really like the conversation your having. why cant we sit down and have discussions with people that we dont agree with anymore. also why are we going back 10-20 yrs on people  thats just ridiculous. can we just give the cancel culture there participation trophy and send them on there way already.
always nice to listen to reasonable takes in a political world of insane people
came here by way of the quartering.  you know what melonie   honestly.  jeremy was right.  you do have a natural talent for this. Im impressed.  you have a natural  engaging banter and voice that draws people s attention and focus.  a little more practice and polish and I can see you becoming a multi-million subscriber youtuber eventually.anyway  good luck on your channel  post consistently like jeremy said and I have no doubt you ll do very well.  you have just won over another new subscriber.  _
its sad. some people have nothing better to do then bring others down. great to see your channel has grown heaps since yesterday!! wow!!
that thumbnail is solid and your videos are informative and enticing.    this channel will get moving fast
I came from the quartering channel. love your channel so far. youre a really sweet person and a Christian like myself. I hope I can see more content from you soon. you ve earned another subscriber.
its sad how we cancel people for what they did years ago. we as a species change or try to. people need to find something to do  stop all the hate. just subscribed
a korean streamer committed suicide over being cancelled in the comments  within a few hours her mother committed suicide as well. truly sad times. they do not realise the damage they inflict on people s lives.
now I came here from the quartering but Im staying for your commentary on the Bibles teachings. previously I was a Christian but am currently an atheist. none the less  the lack of understanding behind what that book teaches is entirely staggering to me. it is truly refreshing to me to hear someone who believes in that book say some stuff that actually makes sense. subscribed.
being able to admit your faults and own them is liberating. its called being real. it isn t permission to go out and deliberately make mistakes  its a learning moment. an opportunity to grow.Ive made many mistakes. I dont want to make them again but they helped me be who I am today. and in that I am glad Imade some of these mistakes because I am a better me than I was before.
be strong girl  just subscribedstay pretty and off from wokeness
fantastic video mel  your support is inspiring.
found you from the quartering  staying cause the content seems good. sub earned!
found out about you through jeremy. here to throw some support your way and looking forward to your future content.
I am here because of the quartering. I dont like canceling anyone  especially simply for their likes  dislikes or opinions. I hope your channel does well. good luck!
Im here to support you please dont change!
I love melonie mac. keep speaking your mind.
hope you make lots of vids. looking forward to hearing more from ya
she is the kind of person I would love to be friends with.
keep making videos!!!! I will subscribe if I find myself watching your videos continuously for a period of time.as for the video at hand I fear wokeness has infected politics too much for it to just blow over  I as a gay man and religious was turning heads until they tagged me self hating it has really become a monster that threatens the free world in my opinion.
just here to subscribe and watch stuff because the stupid woke mob  looking forward to future vids  dont let the crazies get ya down! hope youre doing well!
stay strong girlie girl. dont let the idiots get to you. and stay honest. I dont give my regards out so freely. heh heh!
maybe when enough are shoved they will finally realize that type of mentality is just wrong  but I also think a lot of the canceled woke people will just give the  I will educate myself  apology and get back in and become even more woke  because they are afraid to get kicked out of their cult again.
hail from the quartering! we need the freedom to think and speak for ourselves. thanks for putting yourself out there.
the problem with apologizing to the woke crowd is that it actually makes things worse. nothing you say or do will redeem you in their eyes  and by admitting  guilt   you just give yourself a confirmed history of being an  oppressor . which means that if your name ever comes up  it will always have that notation behind it.
this is why I put quotation marks when I post lyrics on my social media.
I d love to hear your commentary about the reason why this woke stuff even exists.
from the quartering...these fools need to be stopped. wishing you all the best on your new venture.
melonie mac  we need those daily uploads.I heard that you were a good egg. a double yoker even the rarest of the good eggs.
jeremy from the quartering sent me. he said you were a good one and worth giving a sub to. looking forward to hearing another opinions voice on culture topics!
Im here from the quartering. you have my full support against these psychopaths.
excellent vod  mel! Im sick and tired of the cancel   woke cultures! it has to stop! its a shame thatshe was wrongfully terminated  thats not legal and she could have sued their asses for it. they did not deserve to have her for an employee. Im happy that the woke and cancelers are eating their own! we are the rebel resistance and rebel scum!down with woke   cancel cultures! up with love   respect culture!
f  k  em  keep your content coming! glad to see more sane people in this space.
I dont wanna be that guy but Im not exactly sad thatshe got a bit of her own woke medicine. hopefully this will be a huge learning opportunity for her.
just watched you from the quartering. now Im new subcriber of yours oh and dont worry I annihilated that like button! dont let those woketurds get to you
watched both of your videos and damn I am a fan I love this content is also very positive! the quarter sent me
heard about you from the quartering. he was right  you are a  good egg . looking forward to your future content. good luck  I will be subscribing.
I cant stand being around fake people thank you for saying that.
I never watched gamestop tv  honestly didn t even know that was ever a thing until today . Im a bit of a boomer for being 37. Im more focused on what I need to be doing to get my own life where I want it to be.thatsaid  I found out about this channel from jeremy at thequartering. I was cautiously interested. Ive now watched  more listened to  really  both of your videos thus far and I like what I see  hear . Im nobody  just a rando ginger dude with a couple tiny channels  but you ve earned a sub from both my channels.God bless  sister.
ice t original gangster is one of my desert island albums.  I know just about every song by heart  even the monolugues and bits.  there is zero chance there aren t recordings of me repeating whole songs or me posting lines from that album -- and Im nobody.  if it was worth anyone s time to cancel me  you only get power from cancelling people that are hard to cancel   it would be really easy.  I d probably even help them out  honestly.
our past is what makes  us who we are. the good the bad and the ugly! they must be so insecure  and hate themselves.
I had a wokey contact my employer and tried to get me fired for speaking out against the poke.  I told my boss I will not apologize for my feeling.  thankfully   my employer didn t cave to them and nothing was said or done after that.   and I continue to speak my feelings.
hear about the shite thats going on and what they are trying to do with you.here in support and subbed !
subscribed after checking out your channel after the quarterings shout out. time to support the people who need us most!
please make more! cant wait for more content.
jeremy vouched for you and you seem hella cool! subbed and clicked the bell!  3
preach it girl..
a dangerous friend sent me. look forward to hearing what you have to say. best of luck with your new channel!
cope harder
@eric b  remember that time you were saying that thing I didn t care about  yeah  that is now.
well jeremy vouched for this channel and that is enough for at least try some of the content  hoping to see more of your channel.
totally agree with your stance  very reasonable. looking forward to your next videos
found you from your friend on the quartering. cant wait to hear more from you. God bless
came to check you out  cuz of jeremy.. here to see what s up  and  would love to see a female s perspective on a lot of current issues  hopefully you give this a solid go  cuz I like your take on this.. keep it up!!
the quartering told me you were targeted for being his friend so I subbed. welcome to the party darling.
enjoyed hearing your perspective. looking forward to more videos.
there is so much hate in the world. just because you disagree with them  you are canceled. they need to grow up  and get a life. just my humble opinion. oh by the way just found you per quartering.  keep up the good work!
until they cancel the artists who make the music that is being quoted I wouldn t even acknowledge them. if they are insinuating that one group is weaker than others so that they are injured to a greater degree by words  then that is an entirely different discussion.
this is why Im afraid to even stream or make videos anymore because Im afraid that Im not going to be able to do so properly because people dont really respect my time and space too much  but there s also this risk right here especially when I am really outspoken myself that I ll be canceled for much less especially that Im a guy and I dont have nearly as much protection as most people would think.  think its sexist as you like  but at the same time  you also have to consider if you were in my shoes as well.if nothing else  I usually feel like I always have a target on my back especially from people who are always backseat driving on how I should do things.
hold on to your clothes  keep your hand inside the ride at all times... shizz about to take off!more power to you!
keep it up you are doing great
anyone jeremy supports  I support. subbed and liked both your videos. looking forward to seeing more of your takes on societal things
okay  one thing that was 10 years ago  she must have been a teenager  geesh  another thing  if this lady tweeting these song lyrics offends you  dont ever hang out in a biker bar.
this is a shame  those are good songs too. in my 50 years here on earth Ive learned a long time ago   who ever smelt it  dealt it.  honestly  the one doing the blaming is more than likely the one who is actually an evil person inside. Im black and this is really funny  no insults period. man this funny.
jeremy sent me. looking forward to seeing how your channel develops
I subscribed because jeremy  the quartering  said you needed the support.  cant wait to see those daily videos!
came here because of the quartering  stayed for the Bible lesson halfway through.  rock on sister in Christ!
a lot of it is my generations fault.  we told our kids that they were unique  they could do anything they wanted  and they would change the world.  unfortunately what my generation did not tell their kids was that everyone else was unique too  so they are pretty much the same as everyone else  just different in very slight ways.  that no  they cant do anything they want  they should do stuff that ties to their aptitudes.  they cant do anything.  some things are glaringly obvious like a parapalegic or quadrapalegic would have some serious issues competing in f1 racing.  and sometimes its just not their aptitude even though they want to do it.  sure you may be able to draw nice pictures  but just because you are the best artist in your jr high school of 500 kids does not mean that when you try to go after the world stage with 7 billion people  your skills are good enough to compete.  sure they might be  but just like all those kids who want to play the nba  football  etc...  its a lot harder to get in than people think.  and people can change the world.  lots of people want to change the world  very few people are actually able to change the world.  it generally requires a very large platform gained via either fame or fortune.  everyone can change the world  it generally takes far more work than a single act to do it.  and then when our kids hit college and the workforce as millennials  the real world smacked them with a lead cinderblock.  and this is the result.
used to follow you on fb  glad jeremy let us know you were here!
so  I found you on tiktok first  like 6 months ago  one of your silly  go to the gyyyyym  videos showed up on my fyp. I died laughing. checked out your page  found a similar video about  get the vacciiiiine  and I fucking lost it!  thats pretty much the extent of the exposure Ive had to you  up until today.I just watched jeremy s video on the quartering  about you. just random as hell. I didn t even know you had a youtube channel  or that you had anything to do with gamestoptv at any point in your life. honestly  Im rambling. but I came here to say that I fell into the rabbit hole  Im here. and youre awesome.
its tough - people get jealous of others having any ounce of success or happiness and the miserable mob tries to ruin lives and get a sick twisted sense of gratification from it
@melonie mac go boom  right  I already punish myself with my inner  monologue for the smallest mistakes I dont need it in stereo with someone adding to it.
a new subscriber from the quartering.... keep pushing out content  Im here to consume it...
I know its crazy. a person could lose their sh t and shout a bunch of stuff they dont mean and if someone it recording it  their entire  life can basically be over.
best of luck to you and your new project.
jeremy from thequartering suggested me to check your channel. good stuff  hope to see your channel grow and wish you the best!
17 02 youre a good person melanie.
Imet her in person at twitch con. she s super nice.
Im here to support you! what they did to you is bullshit. oh btw the quartering sent me!
awesome  congrats on the new channel!  looking forward to it!!!
hey melonie  came here from the quartering. sorry about what happened.  I subbed to give you a head-start  good luck with the channel.
awe man I thought ashnI was safe from that. is it even possible to not be a robot on social media anymore
here from the quartering as well. dont let these crazies stop you. do your thing! we got your back.
greater are they who are for us than those who are against us.
let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
lmfao Im glad all my social media accounts are suspended or just deleted. just in case I ever become someone worth cancelling they wont find anything. but honestly  they can just stick around being annoying and I ll give them plenty to cancel me for. though there might be ss out there from haters of the past  usually if I see someone is being cancelled I look into them expecting to like them and hold a lot of the same views and beliefs.
good luck! happy to give your channel a shot
haha if my employer went through my tweets from this morning I d be fired instantly. good video  the quartering sent me.
a male feminist called you an internal misogynist  that one got me. quarter boy brought me hear
these types of movements always eat their own eventually.  you can only raise yourself up by pushing others down for so long.
here to show my support! I ll watch every day.
cancel culture never ceases to amaze me lmaoto anyone who s wondering what song is being quoted  that is  the motto  by drake and it is a damn good song!
every time I hear story like this I visualized the snake eating its own tail Im really surprised that the left dont use that as their emblem its kind of perfect if you think about it
melonie mac I love all your episodes plus you are super smart oh my God how you put the face cam together super good.  ilovemeloniemac genius
I heard from jeremy about all that bs you went through.  those of us who support freedom of speech and freedom of association or whatever need to support each other.
32 years old here  itseems like us 90s kids split in two.those who treat man in God s image.and those whose eyes are covered in scales.acting like they wouldn t eat thatsweet sweet apple
not gonna lie. the censorship sticker that you used made me chuckle a little.
the quartering sent me. keep thinking for yourself and dont let them destroy you!
jeremy sent me your way.  staying for the content.  subscribed.
let he without sin cast the first stone.  I would love to see what sort of past these  woke knights  have. I dare say every single one of them has dirty laundry that makes them fit for cancellation by their own standards. such a shame. the world preaches that  love is love   but they dont even know what love is. jeremy was right about you. got your head screwed on  and I am looking forward to seeing what you get up to with your commentary.come Lord Jesus  come.
I ll be honest  I have no sympathy for anyone in the woke space that gets cancelled by their own peers. you are a Christian  mel  so Im sure youre familiar with this passage from hosea   for they sow the wind  and they shall reap the whirlwind. these people have been sowing wind their whole careers. its time to do some reaping.
hopefully we get tons more content.
love ya meloonie. welcome to the outcast club.
I would love to go back into into the cancel cultures history and see what I dig up......should be interesting!!!!
jeremy sent me here! Im looking forward to hearing your perspective and watching future videos. cheers!
good stuff  hit the nail on the head.

here from the quartering to give you a sub and say keep up the great work. you are a rockstar!
subbed to you because of quartering suggested to and I saw your content and love it   great video

hImelonie. came over you by the recent update from jeremy @  thequartering. heard you got fired for basically acknowledge his existence    gave you a follow and like  best of luck with d future melonie.
referred to you by the quartering. keep fighting the good fight!
new sub from the quartering. I look forward to more content  as you have a good head on your shoulders.
heard about stuff  hope to see some interesting vids in the future. health to you.
my hart goes out to the girl and I hope she gets through this. but I will remind everyone that this is a woke on woke crime. being supportive of some who s going through a cancelation is great. but at the same time grab you pop corn and enjoy the show.
here to support you.
some respectable content creators have featured you or given you shout-outs recently. just consistently make good productions. you are obviously attractive  but I doubt you would be satisfied with that being the reason for people consuming your content. it also isnt sustainable unless you like starting streamer drama like some brain dead e-girl. people will show up because youre pretty  shoutouts  your gender  etc...but some quality content will keep them and ensure your consumer base has substance. you have the personality  intelligence  rapport...just be consistent regardless of ups and downs.I also heard the word  scripture  in a discussion regarding you. maybe a post-it note reminder of  the hand of the diligent maketh rich.  would be encouraging.im not one for disengenuous callaboration for clout  but if your personality clicks with gothix a convo betweem the two of you could be interesting. she is also one of those  scripture  people
everytime I hear  boom  I think of thatstatue from night at the museum thatsays  boom boom firepower  as he flexes  but now I picture melonie doing the flex pose cause she s fit af. random rant over
just came from the quartering. Ive always been aware of what you do  but never followed you before. subscribed
would be cool to make a series on this topicedit   maybe not  just  this topic
nobody is ever woke enough  eventually they all get held to their higher and more ridiculous standards.. sent here from thequartering
I d say good-luck but considering you got 10k subs in two days.... lmao  yeah you ll be a superstar   peace from oz mate.
here from jeremy  looking forward to more videos on your perspective!
sent by jeremy. will be watching your career with great interest. show us what you got.
God bless melonie- found about you from the quartering -subbed
oh no they ll never let go of something you said ten years ago. - falling in reverse.
the quartering brought me here and after watching this Im glad I went. I look forward to seeing more videos.
I am black. this type of behaviour makes me feel so ashamed of what my own people and people trying to  protect us  are doing. I dont want people to walk on eggshells. how gross is it to take away someones right to sing a song  if you dont want people to sing along  dont make the song. the hype around this word is just so blown out of proportion in woke culture. I think your average black person does not view it thatshe be  cancelled  for this. just the hyper-woke minority. woke culture has made me feel worse about my race self on so many different levels- more than anything or anyone else ever has.
I do recall seeing you on the tv in my local gamestop and I have friends who work at my local gamestop and even they wonder what happened to you
really liked you on chrissie podcast. waiting impatiently for your takes.
11 08 amen to that girl.
bahaha yesss
I dont have a twitter  but the  and Jesus  cemented the deal. subbed
checked out your videos on jeremies recommendation. great content so far like your sense of humor  ill be subbing. keep it up.
got your back girl!
just seen what happened to you on the quartering. times are crazy good luck
quatering subs incoming  melonie  he aint sent wrong yet.
here from the quartering . good luck with the channel much! much love from australia.
so we re all gonna post the lyrics of nellys - country grammar  explicit  on twitter right  jeremy sent me! new supporter. keep being authentic and dont bend the knee
I just subscribed to her channel to show her support. is there any other way to help
it is interesting to see how practices from the 50s and 70s are being revived. in worldculture cancellation  previously for other reasons  but the essence of the practice does not change . in russia  we are literally returning all the practices of soviets.
here is part of the problem with making certain words forbidden. eventually that list gets bigger.
alright  2 videos in and I like this woman. hate it when jeremy is right  lol.
watching your sub count go up by 1 000  every 3 seconds I refresh is awesome
totally agree with you.
jeremy said you are with a sub so I will watch what you put up. love what I have seen so far
good shit  girl... subbed.
song lyrics  quoting song lyrics. you know how much I like cyprus hill  nwa  and ice t.o.o . . . .  good luck ashni. thank you mel.
here from the quartering  hope to see more! btw your audio mixing seems just a little bit quiet
a cuddly bear sent me here. you ve got my full support petal
I like that you said society like rebels and outcasts band together because king david when he was on the run the mighty men that followed him were rundown outcasts
here from the quartering. just subscribed  and enjoy the content so far. good luck!
your very smart  very based ill be back to watch more.
Im a black person here and this is just embarrassing. while I personally believe that the n word with a hard  r  is off limits  the one that ends an  a  is technically slang that is a commodified version of the original slur. personally for me  I have no problem with people saying it  black or not  calling each other it as long as there is no malicious or racial intent. an example would be anyone  hello my fellow n word to any raceme  speaking for myself I have no problem with  thatanyone  calling a black person  you dirty n word scum  me  thats wrong in regards to this person  this tweet was made 10 years ago and they were posting lyrics from a song. its not as if they were saying it or endorsing that non blacks should say it. it happened over a decade ago and these fucking crazies are trying to ruin her life over it when she s most likely changed and everyone has moved on from it.speaking for myself  to the people crying about the use of the n word  t s just a word  the only power it has over you is the one you give it. there s a difference between saying it and being legitimately racist.
sent here by jeremy from the quartering. enjoyed your commentary  subscribed. keep up the great work.
hello I watched both your vids  I like your presentation a lot. I think 10 minute vids would be better than 20 though  ty and gl I ll stay tuned.
the quartering sent me to your channel  and I just subscribed  which is kind of funny since Im not actually subscribed to his channel.
the quartering made me sub. and Im a Christian  too. not a gamer  but I support those who do good.
hey  @thequartering recommended your channel. ignore the crazies. good luck with the new channel.
never apologize to the mob.
the quatering uncancel crew reporting. good luck!
they gonna fire everyone who listens to rap  that word s in every sentence  and even if people dont say it in public you know they are rapping those lyrics in their car.
11 01 Im not necessity a religious man but this truth is truer every day.
they could be sued for libel except they used a loophole where they didn t use her name in the statement.
Im here because jeremy from the quartering gave you a shout out. sucks that the mob came after you.
subscribed. nuts to be fired just for having contact with someone who is a woke target.
fired over a 11 year old tweet smh this is why you never go full woke  yeah thats a tropic thunder reference also never ever apologize to the woke mob ever.  in my assessment of the woke they think no one ever grows or changes which is nuts in my honest opinion.
the quartering sent us! looking forward to seeing if you are entertaining!
Jesus said  let those without sin throw the first stone  and a lot of these  woke  people have a lot of sins they re trying to hide
some of us dont do twitter.  link her youtube as well if you can.
wow I subbed at 300   glad to see you at 11k subs.
here because of jeremy. watched your vids on this account  like the content  clicked the red sub button.
me having just cured all disease ever giving a press conference  today marks the first day of the rest of eternity  humanity no longer need fear disease reporter raising their hand  uhh excuse me is it true that when you were 12 you used the f-word on a classmate who pushed you in the mud
haya jeremy said your cool  so your cool  looking forward to seeing what your content is like.
I also came here from the quatering...I like what I hear so far. never bow down to the woke mob
quartering put me on to you. I liked your take on this... and then you began talking about scripture  and Jesus.... subbed. bell.
hey!! came here from the quartering and Im not disappointed. great content has earned you a new sub!!
not a sub of thequartering  and got recommended his video anyway. I watched it and subbed to you  in support of your fairer views and hate people that would ruin your life over some stupid shit.
Im of the mind set of  if something is offensive  its offensive  full stop  lol couldn t resist there. doesnt matter where or who does it. if the word she got canceled for is so offensive we need to cancel people for it  it needs to stop being used in songs  pop culture or anywhere else. itshould just be a taboo word never to be spoken again. very few things offend me  very very few. however the few things that would offend me would offend me just as much if my wife said or you  random person on the interwebs. that word isn t offensive. people just pretend its offensive because they can and its a power they hold over others. if it was so offensive there would be at least a day here and there that would go by without me hearing it a bunch of times. I cant remember the last day that went by and I didn t hear it. even if Im sick injured in bed all day.
here from the quartering to show support. I am tired of the woke media.
dont ever stop telling ppl about the truth of Jesus sacrifice. love it.
here because jeremy recommend but enjoy your commentary.  keep it up!
thumbs up for the neffex outro!
hello  thequartering told me about this channel  but Im not subscribing because of him  but because of you. you make sense.
I bet you its someone she knows  probably someone at her job who will benefit from her losing hers.
Im conflicted here. I dont think she should have posted the song lyrics even back then I would have had issue with it. not enough to do all of this  but this at least have a conversation about it. also its been over a decade. Im sure she has grown a lot in that time. she made a mistake. we all make mistakes  however getting someone fired from their job and probably making it more difficult for them to obtain their next one on top of it is way over the line. in general though Ive been a fan of her for a year or two.
I think those people would spontaneously combust if they listened to a certain song by clawfinger. or a certain song by marilyn manson.
this is my commandment that you love one another  that your joy  may be full .
jeremy said you needed some back up.  my eyes are here.
I am here because of jeremy the great. good quality content melonie.
hey there.  got a tip on your new channel from the quartering. looking forward to hearing more from you here.
if my company has an issue with my tweets and fires me  bye then. y all cantalk to my lawyer.
here because of thequartering. definitely agree with him that a  you need a pop filter and b  you are more attractive than jeremy.
subbed heard about you from jeremy.good luck gamestop has taken an l this time.
here because of a shout out from jeremy. subscribed because I liked the content.
your generation needs a gg allin!
jeremy sent me here. I did see your video and I like your content so far. much love and support.
this must mean that the company is going to fire the majority of their black employees  since its quite likely that many such people have quoted rap lyrics.they gotta go.
everyone is a sinner...let he who is without sin cast the first stone...everyone is guilty. some people are more aware of this than others. some people are more ignorant than others. its our job to bring awareness light to this or make light of ignorance darkness .
she shouldn t have posted itstill. you know that word s always been bounded! no!
if we have been taught anything  it is to not bow to the screeching woke children. nothing is ever enough for them...
if everyone cant quote the song  should it be in the song
another sub from jeremy
your eyes  are hypnotizing
saw her apology and honestly I think she should not apologize  she did nothing wrong. it was ages ago when the word was not  banned . I hate this -.-
I I remember from the Bible when the lady who committed adultery was brought in front of Jesus is no different than cancel culture. then Jesus said   he who is without sin can cast the first stone.  I think we shouldn t hold others to any higher morals than we have shown. if we realized that we are all on this journey of making mistakes and learning  then we might support each other more. I think old sayings should be remember for the context they were given in.
I am here b c jeremy said to come and check you out. I like your message. we got your back!subbed. cant wait to see more from ya.
11 12 -11 23 lezzzzz goooo!! thats the gospel good news  of Jesus Christ!!!!!
he who is without sin  cast the first stone.
those drawings on you are gonna look sick in 30 years!
the mob isn t bullying. its targeted criminal harassment.
absolute insanity! its got to stop
the thing about the cancellers is that everyone one of them have said  done and or believe far more racist offensive things than the people they try to cancel.  they cancel people to stop their  peers  from cancelling them  because none of them could survive being cancelled.  their view on what is racist  sexist etc. is also flipped on what the other 90 to 99  of the population view as racist  sexist etc. for example if you talk to have an interaction with someone and you are more concerned with the type of person they are and dont prioritize what race ethnicity they are  to these people you are a racist  because they care more about skin color than character.also twitter  where they mostly are  is used by 2  of the population  and at most 50  of the people on there believe in the woke ideology  thats 1  of the population.  edit the other reason they try  cancelling people is because they want power over other people.
this ideology of digging up years past instances to destroy someone today is just rotten and shouldnt be tolerated any longer.
I will apologize to them if I am forced to end some of them  and those that were involved were only indoctrinated  and not the ring leaders.
I hope woke culture crumbles  but at the same time seeing people actually be pro mandate and pro censorship shows to me that way too many people will accept ideals that I wouldn t never consider to be remotely popular. its gone on for way too long and our vocabulary and culture is being erased bit by bit. as for lyrics being problematic  could you imagine if there were consequences to those that actually wrote those  problematic  lyrics  I dont think that would go down very well at all.
you can never be woke enough  professor x probably
the problem is that a group of people have changed the idea of what is acceptable. the rational position is to include context in the determination of what is offensive. to a rational mind  intent matters. this group has come along and said context and intent do not matter   and many people say  okay I will accept this . the problem is that even if you comply they hold past actions to this new invented standard  it doesnt matter to them that there was a different standard at that time. this is why the woke will always eat their own  they are dedicated to defining new ways of being offensive. whatever is safe today is offensive tomorrow. noone  is safe. wokeism is a fundamentally authoritarian philosophy that must be refuted by sane freedom loving people everywhere.
this whole video just summed up my fears of the cancel culture mob. Ive been meaning to start my youtube channel out for about a month now  a gaming channel and tomb raider was to be my first walkthrough but Ive decided to back away from it because of how crazy cancel culture has become and how the slightest phrase thatshouldn t be remotely offensive can be taken out of context and used against you. also with classic tomb raider being under fire these days as nothing more than a  misogynists wet dream  and classic lara was nothing more than a sex symbol which is false   I was surprised to see how many people scrutinize classic tomb raider in todays day and age. its unfortunate too because doing youtube has been a dream of mine since 2009 but with the way the platform is now  the way the algorithm is mickey moused and along with the cancel culture bringing everyone who doesnt agree with their agenda down  I feel I d be put out before I d even get my feet off the ground with it.
found out about you from the quartering....keep going!
kind of interestingly ironic to hear a Christian talk about the human nature of rebellion  see lucifer. but in all a good video and an interesting listen. yeah  the quartering sent me over. yeah  Im now a subscriber. thanks for the perspective.
the quartering sent me  looking forward to your upcoming content
here from thequartering.  I respectfully disagree with your opinion on lara.  normally Ive got nothing against curvy girls  and often prefer them but the character herself is more than just her body.  by that  Imean  its one aspect of who she is.  I like consistency.  with the active lifestyle she leads  its much more likely she d be thinner.  being more petite is an advantage in that it not only means she requires fewer calories  but also fits into tight spaces better.  if her boobs were getting in the way of her survival  she d at least strap them down.  she s such a badass thatshe d probably even chop them off if the choice was that or death.  thatsaid  you can disagree with someone and provide counter-arguments without resorting to calling them an -ist like they did to you.
over here from the quartering. loving the content. more of the left eating their own. when are people going to learn  rogan should know better!
14 40 dude I am boycotting that company. I dont even know if I d ever even want to use whatever it is that they do but yeah. that company is on my blacklist.
I dont care what side youre on because everybody has a different point of view in everything  but people shouldnt be fired or have their lives crippled over something that was completely taken out of context.
coming from  thequartering   subscribed to your channel  but Im sure Im gonna love your content. have a great future with this channel. regards
are you from the south  I hear a southern accent.I also miss the pretty tomb raider. although the first tomb raider reboot is my favorite.
let s be logical. she didn t say that. kanye said that. she just shared what he said. she got canceled for amplifying a black man s voice.
volume issues  maybe just me  but I really gotta crank it up just for your videos. checked all my settings  other videos are nice a loud.
I ll be up front   say Im not a fan of hers. didn t like the  we must all be better  because these were the crowds she kinda catered to. so live by the sword  die by the sword. however. I dont think she should have stepped down. the mature thing for her to is not go on this self flagellation spree to please everyone  upset  over this. reason people go back as far as a decade to bring up something. is revenge. to claim to be hurt  to deny any change in that decade   how she is now   to hurt her. if she cant understand this then just she gives power to those who hurt her.
good luck and God bless.
agreed
yeah thats the thing  she definitely has catered to people who would  and have  thrown her under the bus for a few perceived internet points. another example of the woke mob exposing themselves and hurting those they have manipulated into their movement
she was  part of the woke mob   your words  and they are over the top including the ignorance they spread.  if it was truly hurtful  artists  would not be using it in music.  people need to be re-taught what communication is.  its not about the word in a sentence ... its the messaging in the language.  for example  when someone apologizes but they do not mean itsincerely.  that is not an apology.  you clearly point out she is part of it - so when they eat their own I have no sympathy  how many has she watched die by the sword and never spoke out for them or fought to protect them
fun thing.crypto crowd tends to hate censorship  cancellation  centralisation  ...  jack dorsey apparently ...  d
cant help but see a double standard here when they fire her for posting kanye s lyrics  but allow artists to sell nfts of kanye on their website.
there are a lot of reasons to throw ashnI out with the trash -- being a multI level marketing scam artist is the primary one  but not for song lyrics. seriously  this woman is a thief and con artist to her core.
the quartering sent me. good luck with the new channel.
mel it is so good to see someone like you speaking out about this stuff.  we need to get rid of these cancel culture lunatics.  thank you thank you thank you!
straight up it is not a word in my vocabulary but  with thatsaid  my view point causes outrage in some. I am very black and white. either  a  culture has been transformative and the meaning of the word has changed. or  b  it has not. you can not pick and choose both as itsuits you.the whole premise that there is now a protected population that can use the a word with one meaning and a population that can not because it has another only propagates division and the very  ism  some claim to be fighting. I find the whole thing disingenuous at the least and a disgusting grab for power at the worst.
you should sue gamestop back into the pong age.
funny how many people try to make sense of what s happening and rationalise about it. if they only knew some history  they would realise this has happened multiple times before. both in russia  china  etc
youre ruined now!
I love the censor used lolof course the woke will go after the woke the left eat their own
you might not think that you are in a position to give anyone a pass for anything  but I am because I am a thinking living human who makes mistakes. all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  when I grew up in the 80s and 90s  the mantra of the day it was  hey nobody s perfect.  either people now believe themselves to be perfect or they dont. if they cancel the mob believe themselves to be perfect  there is an electronic paper trail thatshould be followed so that we can all see the proper way to live and how they got there. of course we wont find that  but rather we will keep this charade going until the entire world is  canceled.  if everyone is canceled  then no one is canceled and we will all be equal again as flawed human beings in need of a savior  since even the cancel mob has determined that the standard to be met is perfection.
in her case  youreep what you sow. they always eat their own
kindness is weakness to the deranged mob. melanie  looks like youre our ready for the mob. being white  beautiful  Christian and a strong woman is the greatest crime.
maybe she shouldn t want to support an company that is so intolerant and not understanding they dont deserve her involvement
quartering sent me here  happy to support you!
heyyy  a young Christian gamer commentator on youtube  heck yeah Im subscribing!
so can we try and cancel all of these lyrics websites because if a song has that word in it  its going to appear when you pull up thatsong and God dammit thats offensive!!!!!

welcome to the culture war. never apologize. also  if youre going to look into this type of stuff  get ready to find the same ppl screaming  racist   are the same ppl saying racist stuff.
saying that word in that way was considered  cool  at one time not too long ago.  especially if it was just in song lyrics.  high time we track down these cancel culture weirdos and force them out from under their rocks.
you ve got a good head on your shoulders.
new sub here. found about you from chrissie mayr and drunk3p0. great content!

large marge sent me.
so many quartering fans here.
people need to stand up against these twitter scumbags. this person contacted her work and probably didnt even explain they were song lyrics. this is someone she knows. probably a fellow employee or an ex.people should defend her. this isnt right. how old was she  16 when she posted that  are you kidding as for her  she needs to sue for wrongful termination and slander. you dont get to write letters like that about people and slander them as racists for posting song lyrics 11 years ago. sue the pants off them.

came from the quartering.

to err is human  to forgive divine   and I dont have to be a religious person to understand this.  and the whole  dont judge  thing. or  he who is without sin cast the first stone  although coming from a religious source.  the core believe is not.  itshould be common sense. what she does is helping people get better.  wonder how many she has help out of a rut or depression because she help them get their channel up thanks to her coaching.  and this is the person they wanna cancel.

jeremy sent me...lgbfjbsubbed
jeremy sent me.
q sent me. lets see what happens.
I bet she wont do that again 10 years ago! lol ive stopped listening to most currentyear black artists. if I cant sing along then wtf would I listen to it  the only exceptions are dax  mc ride and gambino even though he d probably be one to cry about me singing his songs. I like his songs too much to stop though. lol
while I dont necessarily agree with some of what she does and stands for  regarding nfts ... what happened with this is ridiculous. yes  she shouldn t have kept that word completely in there when pasting the song lyrics.. but holy bloody hell... to fire someone over it  absolutely absurd.I wonder if superrare will now look at every single worker and every single person on their platform and go back 10  years on allllllll of their social media accounts and act in the same way. this is bullshit.
subscribed jeremy sent me
anti-racist   hateful speech   safe and inclusive always with the buzzword bingo with these corporate woke clowns.
woke culture is hurting everyone but thats ok.Im just worries what will happen to children that grew up with it.
we are a destination for all people  except racist which would fall under the term  all .
outro song
have you played sifu
let me get this straight   she got fired for promoting a black artists ...jeremy recommend you melanie
let he who is with out sin cast the first stone Christians have been persecuted for years and nothing is ever do about it yet anything like what has happened to Christians was to happen to other faiths and their will be apologies and who knows what going on .it has to end these idiots do it to try and give their own sad lives some meaning. its like musical chairs there will only be 2 people left trying to cancel each other

3 51 even if she did say that.. who cares. black people say that to each other all the time.. african american culture seems to have become the default culture in urban environments where pretty much most young people in urban areas at least have like 5-10  of the african american  vernacular english  or the gestures or the handshakes or the hugs... like everyone I know everyone I know in la hugs each other with that where you like hand shake  pull them to you shoulder to shoulder and you tap their shoulder with your left hand and then you let go.. and not all of them but some of them call me and other friends nI  a. and you can even look at flossy carter online  big black youtuber  no pun intended  telling max lee  asian youtuber  to say nI  a and that its ok  and all of his black friends are laughin and they re all havin fun.there are urban cities where most people there are while but they re all like that kind of culture  they listen to rap music and they all call each other nI  a. this is the stupidest thing I have ever seen  and the only thing I have to say about is  you need to make a choice. either no one can say that word. or everyone can say that word.  you make a choice and thats the choice. its not some bullshit where only black people can say it because thats racist  and I will fight anybody on that and when I say fight .. heh. yeah .. probably literally. but I d probably look at these losers and they would melt  because its probably a bunch of weak white liberal male feminist types that couldn t fight a flea and win. but whatever.and I actually blocked this girl a while back coz of some things she said. the letters tds come to mind.. but I stand with her here  and I will admit I was wrong  coz youre right. for the most part she seems to be a vey nice person. now if you voted for trump ... I dunno how nice she will be to you then. I saw somethings thatshow she s as bad as some of the worst Ive seen on twitter but. everyone makes mistakes including myself and everyone gets angry and has said things they shouldn t have  so I cant judge her and it was wrong for me to judge her before. like I said none of us is perfect and we all make mistakes.but the whole thing with this word needs to go away. and it probably was some dude she rejected that wanted to get back at her coz like you said I dont see anyone doing this to her.
friends back friends
this why Im glad that I dont have a big following on my channel. I just I better stop listening to j z ice t and ice cube old songs. I wonder if that will be next. in case you better check yourself before youreck yourself.
heyo  any friend of jeremys  . . .
no  Im pretty sure she  white  by all implications  or definitions of the expression. lol
I like you felt you need to explain why youre against the mob. Im for cosa nostra mafia before the woke mob  thats how bad I view the woke mob.youre against them I assume because you have a brain   soul   against woke mob
girl  you are free now  you do not ever again have to put all these bs disclaimers on all your comments. thats done  we know. no  she doesnt deserve a pass on race grounds. she deserves a pass  because this is fucking insane to even be a thing.
you need to edit the videos shorter   speak faster.
I am not a republican or democrat. I am a person who believes in all people and the cancel culture will get cancelled eventually. I am posting this months later and several  cancelled  people are making a comeback.
wow thought police is so dumb! what s people s deal
never f  ing apologies to the wokies
like if the quartering sent ya
pretty sweet finding a Christian that is doing these type of videos.
there s nothing wrong with quoting lyrics. if you dont like the language  then attack the person who s actually making money from the music sales  not the people who like the music. this kind of virtue signaling is sick and evil.
honest to God  fuck everyone that has an opinion.  you do you and people need to learn that they gotta do them.  thanks for standing up for what you believe
you should have a conversation with lacI green. lacI is a feminist that got kick out of the group. because she was willing to talk and listing to other ideas from Christians to republicans and other political group. fenniest reeeee. lacI receive the worse harassments. she said people she thought where her friends  treat her like crap. the only group that didn t and was willing to talk to her was republicans  Christians. they treat her as a person. many understand she is still a democrat. her reality change. I dont know what political she is now. but I think you should contract lacI green. and talk to her. just have a conversation with another woman. that is not a crazy left wing. that is willing to have her mind challenge with a different view.
very nice channel!! the secret to ranking   p r o m o s m !!!
sounds like a crappy employer anyway.  find people to work for who aren t ridiculous.
she probably should lose her job for her bad taste in music
silly as fuck to first of all go back 10 years to find dirt on someone  and second of all call them racist when the context wasn t even close to a racist context.
that is terrible.
where s the feminist movement supporting and backing her
funny how white rappers get a free pass for using that word  but white fans dont. seems hypocritical to me.
stop spending money on music you ll be ostracized for singing along with. that would put an end to all of this nonsense.
I am sorry but you are all insane.... I cannot even comprehend how can be a word that cannot be used.... this is pure insanity for anyone looking from outside.
1st
how dare she like music from other cultures !! rrrrrreeeeeeeeeee!!!!  lol. ridiculous!
freedom of speech is not freedom of consequence. I dont agree with this new  woke  culture  but just because you commit a crime and some time has gone by  doesnt mean the crime didn t happen. I dont agree she should have lost her job  but she shouldn t be given a pass either.
eyyy!
you cheated. solo has a game genie!
