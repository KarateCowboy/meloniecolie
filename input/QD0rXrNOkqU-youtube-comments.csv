they are not jealous of what you have. they are jealous of what they cant have. dont let it get you down  mel. boom onward!
hold it like a badge of honour. they only go after those that tell the truth with this kind of crap. proud of you keep it up.
if they re going to these extra length to try and stop you  that means they are scared of you continue being strong  melonienever bend the knee to these crazies
ignore the haters  melonie. youre awesome. keep up the great work.
the crybullies never stop. your perseverance is inspiring.grats on the contest  you got this!
if people are trying to destory you that means youre doing something right and speaking truth. I stand with you truth teller
twitter is nothing but a handheld place for children to get their  feel-wings  hurt. get em melonie!
these people are sick. look at the lengths they go through to try and destroy someone that they disagree with its disgusting. in my book you will never be cancelled  I ll always stand with you and I know others feel the exact same way.
its genuinely insane that people will go to these lengths over something as trivial as an opinion....they live in a very warped reality.
great video melonie  its an enormous relief to see a fellow gamer thats passionate about their medium. its very rare to see someone talk show openly about their favourite character without fear their ideas dont match up with today s culture nuts. keep up the great vids and dont let the haters bring you down. the only reason they complain is because they have very little going on in their own lives.
the more they hate you  the more famous you will become.
I cannot help myself. I really like this channel. even though I am atheist and the Bible readings annoy me  that is fine. one is allowed to express oneself based on ones beliefs I think. I am so glad this channel exists and I hope it continues for a long time.
take this as a compliment that your doing something right and speaking truth s there to fragile to hear. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
ignore the cold hearted. you are an amazing woman with not only a great personality  talent and so on  but very clearly you have a huge capacity for love of others. as far as long videos go  my favorite yter is thexpgamers channel  and his 4-7 hour streamed gameplay videos. not always for the game itself  but because he quite a character and so are his friends who often join him in his gameplay. he will toss his twitch streams onto yt  where I then get the chance to laugh at their jokes and antics. by all means  feel free to stream your elden rings gameplay  I would enjoy that. you have the personality for it  that is for sure. take care  and God bless!
congrats on getting to round 3! the haters make me laugh  just break out your boomstick! I grew up on games like castlevania and contra. I still play roguelikes with permadeath. so I love elden ring its really not that difficult  just lots of fun lol.
you know youre doing something right when you get reactions from the twittermob.
you know youre on the right side of things when you have people going after you like this! keep up the good work
keep your head up  some people dont understand how it is to have your own opinion.they want to be told what to hate and to like.you are a fighting an unending fight against these weirdos   dont let them get you down. I wish you strenght and health to get through it.
watching this channel relieves so much tension.  melonie has such a happy inviting tone. this must be the first time I actually dont mind listening to a woman talk my ear off xd
I know Ive commented twice on this already but one last thing  you are an incredibly strong woman and I admire that about you. they just keep coming after you and keep coming after you and you are still going strong and there s a lot of people that are on your side. yea we all take some heat but not like you do you are out there on the front lines taking it firsthand and I know can be difficult but here you are still smiling and giving hope to me and Im sure others as well.I appreciate you.
jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have  and envy is wanting what someone else has -homer simpson correcting lisa.
@roman arriaga  yep  that works too.
for the most part they are jealous that you have something to love because they are not capable of caring about anything  its kicking over sand castles.

love you  jaaaay
damn straight  love  all your guys content at g g. keep up the great content and keep up the awesomeness.
thats why I left years ago.
life is better when you ain t cesspool site  -
@galadrius the mighty  thats why I never used it. why support shit like that. its enough see it covered by others  seems like a digital insane asylum
@straken swe  yyyyyyup
d e r a n g e d is the word
@clokkworkorange  there s all sorts of words to choose from  regardless its still the same. their nasty comments are a reflection of themselves.
@eggchin  true
marxism 101
Im an atheist too but the verses dont bother me.its part of melonie s whole deal and I dig it. she s kinda awesome actually. super pretty breath of fresh air and her sticking to her faith only adds to it.
here comes the simp brigade
posting more than usual this week on any creator but being here since thequartering mention  Ive checked out your og channel content and history and there you can see a real evolution and need for what this channel is created for.  you have some real gems in there I think did get buried that you have gone back and really hit on with go boom!  very good stuff  and same serious in depth knowledge I think unexpectedly so coming from a lovely lady and the experience behind your statements.  it truly what s going to keep your fans around versus the fluff fads.  the top 5 list caedwyn comment youreviewed is all that needs be said.  putting in work on al fronts.
its sad people spend so much time and resources just to tear people down over nothing  glad you made it to the third round keep up the excellent work.
melonie  some people are so full of anger and dont like themselves that they take it out on people who might have a different opinion. Im glad you will never give in to the woke mob because it will never  ever be good enough. your verse of the day rings true more than ever in these times.
congrats on moving on in the competition!  I ll probably get a smaller order this time but I d like to help keep up the momentum.maybe if you win  it ll show other content creators that they dont have to be parrots or play itsafe to be successful.
this annoys me so much  they always do it and get away with it  and sometimes people suffer for it. these toxic bullies with their fake pictures trying to get people they dont like fired  they need to be stopped. how do they keep getting away with this
I honestly dont mind most of the tech in the legend timeline. the grapple hook  for example  is an aesthetically nice alternative to a whip. plus  I loved how she pulled out her videocamera to document things. more of that lara!
I like the length of your vids  as someone whos watches your vids recently  I like that you address the point of your vid for the first half  engage with your audiance with chat replies and have a biblical verse of the day  im not religious but if thats what you want to produce  then dont stop  so as a fan I know where your format plays out  if I want your opinion on a topical issue  based on your video title.  I know when to tune in  and according to your format   I know when to tune out if I domt want a religious section or a opintion  I dont want to hear about.
what is dead may never die.  ---  what is cancelled  cannot be cancelled.
you know you ve made it when  they  try to cancel you  and some of those fake tweets were priceless - maybe you can quote your fake-self for fun!
well you just gained one more subscriber.  their efforts had the opposite effect on me.  as a 50 yo gamer I support your right to express  an opinion and those who try to suppress your voice will only help it grow.
hey  mel! the longer format videos are way better  for me at least. thank you for the laughs! need me some of that  as my country goes downhill at lighting speeds due to sanctions.
haha. I actually really liked fe  three houses. for me  all the story elements and cut scenes helped keep me invested. but I hear you on elden ring. from what Ive seen of your playthroughs  it excels at exploration  discovery  and immersion in the world  some of what I loved about botw  so I can understand where youre coming from.
heck yeah melonie !!!!!! congrats on the g-fuel competition. youre a rockstar !
hey melonie just wanted to say thank you  you are doing great. youremind me of so many of the super chill women Ive met through various social groups in my life  and your videos feel like Im hanging out with a friend. your tweet about elden ring being the kind of game that makes you never want to play a glorified walking simulator again is 100  spot on. the fact that you got so much hate  as well as likes support  just shows you are right over the target. thanks again  you rock  keep up the good work!
so uh  here s a quote tweet from someone replying to that gustavo guy damn  she deleted the tweets and  now she and her cult are saying she never tweeted it. truly disturbing stuff. thank you @gustavosalesman for bringing this into the lightyeah... unsurprisingly all the red flags were here.
just goes to show you aren t the bad guy they try to make you out to be when they have to make fake evidence to support their fake claims.
I absolutely love your channel. dont change for these hating twerps. youre awesome
wear this like a badge of honor. they want you gone so bad  now they have to go as far as making shit up to ruin your reputation  thats a win. that means they done went through everything  found nothing  or found stuff that you already owned and explained and now they have to put effort in to not only make up fake shit  but also double down to try and convince people that its legit.
you always manage to find the perfect Bible verse to encapsulate what s going on in every video  keep booming!
sometimes even if the subject doesnt interest me I open the video just to see melonie say  melonie mac go boom  in the intro haha
@mike pc  not talking about twitter letting them get away with it  Imean people letting them get away with it. these trolls need to be held accountable. surely its defamation at the least.
three houses is sooo good!
@melonie mac go boom   sorry for the late reply . I actually watched this back shortly after your response. I believe I responded before the video was over  and probably before you finished your point . but I think I see what youre saying  you liked three houses  but the number of cutscenes there wouldn t work in every game.
God such sad losers   !stay strong melonie you rock!
I totally agree with you about playing thru a movie in modern games. I get the same shade when I play a new game with my friends and 30 mins in they say   this awesome!  and  man this is fun! . and I reply   yeah Ive walked forward  clicked a few things and watched cutscenes. this is fucking boring.  I know what you mean totally. stay you. cheers!
congrats for progressing on the g-fuel competition.  Im rooting for ya.
the actions of people like this say much worse things about them than they could ever say about you.
here to support you via thequartering! go girl!!
I like longer videos as well  I could listen for hours tbh. its hard finding anything worth watching these days.
before the sequels  I bought the first game of the reboot. it was okay. it didn t leave me with an interest in a sequel. however  after hearing some things  I decided to buy the second two. the main reason is that the difficulty settings offered a rare depth. one of those categories was  exploration.  does itstill hold your hand if you change the difficulty settings   I bought the sequels in order to support some of the good things they were doing  but I haven t played them yet.
reasonable opinions  great personality  people trying to cancel you  consider me subscribed.
I always had you figured for a badass. screw them they aren t worry to lace up your shoes! stay awesome  enjoy your content! I doubt your old enough to remember star trek klingon and borg games kind of corny but really enjoyed them  just came to mind when you talked about cutscenes.
they only hate you cause they hate themselves and thats a sad life.  youre independent now. let them scream till they lose their voice. never negotiate with the terrorists.
I like your longer videos also I listen to them at work a lot of the time so it kinda sucks when a video I wanna listen to is only like 8 minutes long or something and I have to take my phone out of my pocket while Im up high on a ladder or something and find another video to listen to lol
I think that is why I like bryce in the jolie movies especially when she just smashed the clock when he taking it apart. or after she destroy the robot  and she like did you program itstop before it took my head off. I do think she would have someone like bryce around to help her with tech stuff  closer to q maybe where the tech just does what her and her pistols cant.
stay strong melonie!!
having haters is just a side effect of popularity  its like being a beautiful green garden and having to deal with the bad weeds around
awee they tried to do that to melonie  lol haters are going to hate. also  you look adorable with the short hair up like that. never saw you with your hair like that.  I think japan animation vs american is debatable honestly  the 80 s and 90 s I ll take american any day over anime. tas  xmen series etc were epic. for that time all japan really had was db  now there s so many animes and western cartoons its ridiculous. but all about preference.
I need to get words out!  haha  that was adorable.
people dont think for themselves  they d rather have something to hate. I find the saltiness hilarious.
I honestly dont mind long videos as long as the topic interests me.
ignore the tweets. youre fans love your show and the haters are just sad people.
they re jealous of your success.keep going
them   tries to cancel somebody with fake tweets.melonie   uses one of the fake tweets as idea for real tweet.me    hey twitter trolls  why you hitting yourself p.s if you liked zero dawn you ll probably like forbidden west  that being said the npcs telling you  the player  exactly what to do to solve most puzzles is still there  and its still infuriating. just let me use my brain to figure it out developers!
keep it up with the great content !
I watch you for a long time over on your other channel  never seen you text like that. people really need to look closer before jumping the ball on someone.
personaly  Im just going to say this   someone else made a video about you  about how some ...  people     tried to cancel you  and  I wanted to see if  by watching your clips  they were right or not ! ... thankfully  I discovered that they were wrong  and  I decided to subscribe to your channel  as I can see   the sea of trolls  continues to make waves  but  their lies come to the surface  and the trolls go hide into the deepths  also  personally  I like watching long clips of players who play different games  from start to finish  or to an extend  and  depending on some games  it may take them few hours to reach the end of the game  or  sometimes  takes more than that  so ...
this is why I would never want to be a public figure they would want to cancel me so hard.
I think its funny when a cancel warrior gets cancelled. there was someone on twitter  always twitter  who was very militantly woke and would make hundreds of reports everyday to get people banned. he eventually got banned. I figure the twitter enforcement people just got tired of his crap and got rid of him. still though I got a kick out of it. what goes around comes around.
we ll always have your back  mel!
new found respect for melodie. calling woke bs
they dont go after people they dont see as a threat.  you are judged by the quality of your enemies.
man I cantell you are such a huge tomb raider fan. because you mention lara croft in every video  I think thats awesome. my dad who was preaching in a church service one day said that all of his haters said that they were actually his cheerleaders. so dont worry about your haters they are actually cheering you on.also side note that is a dope mha tank top
they cant cancel someone who have the Lord as there shield
Im pretty sure 99  of people on twitter aren t real   so wouldn t worry about them lol. you know who youre and thats all that matters .
Im with you on the not voting  I also haven t voted since I was 21... so like 17 years  feel that its all just rigged but Im also against it because in my country its illegal to not vote  but there s loopholes which Ive taken advantage of  I feel the forced participation is wrong  governments can restrict things  dont speed  dont steal  dont murder etc  but governments forcing you to do something is wrong
just sayin if that g-fuel shaker custom thingy doesnt work out  it would be dope af if you had your own custom camelbak eddy! love your stuff!
Im glad to see you dont let these morons get to you. just keep doing what youre doing...
played tr2  golden mask recently. took me a while to play it because for a long time the prospect of no cutscenes at all just sounded horrible to me. but its really good. as good if not better that tr2 level design wise.
is good to have haters  you have someone who is thinking about you 12000  of their time xdnow seriously  its sad the so called  tolerant  people are almost always the most intolerant people who try to cancel when someone share a slightly diferent point of view
there are alot of things I dont like these days. but I never go online and harass people on social media. I got my job and better things to do.just ignore them and voice your opinion.
agree that feth had good timing for cutscenes and not relying on em. people really have too much free time crating fake tweets to try an cancel others
haters are gonna hate just means youre telling the truth when they come after you
I will never understand people that go online just to troll  hate or whatever   Imean  who got the time !  Im currently playing horizon and I never took your  opinion  as a knock on it...or any other game  specifically  but simply an observation you had.  however  when you do play forbidden west  youre gonna remember just how awesome it is!  its fantastic and by far  for me  at least  the best looking game Ive ever played.
itsucks that Im not going to play this game  I feel left out lmao
people can be so gullible  especially when it confirms their biases.
totally understand the sentiments about games being a walking sim! but as a working student I kinda just wanna hop on a game  hold w  use a little brain power and beat the game xd
melonie mac has been cancelled more times than futurama at this point
hey Ive been loving your vids  I didn t even know you had another channel.  I think the algorithm is malicious and hurts youtubers more than it helps.  I hope you keep going  I also agree that elections are decided for us.  also  I wonder how youreconcile the faith with advocating for sexy character models.  on a secular point I get it  censorship is awful  but what about when Jesus says that looking with lust is committing adulatory in your heart   I ll probably be commenting on future vids because if I said everything I wanna say in one comment it would look like the constitution. God bless you.
youre the best malmac since alf!
melonie  elden ring is fantastic!bloviating twitterbots  she must be stopped.
as a libertarian  myself  its funny how we get mistaken for republicans. also funny what people make up just to  cancel  somebody. great vid
never bend the knee  never apologize  monetize their stupidity.
your laugh is infectious!
your opinion on making games is right. I do love bethesda games  but game after game gets thinner and thinner with story. I loved oblivion and got into all the people and stories going on around me. now it all feels so bland. no crazy guy to convince to stop or help him get killed. no quests so fun like the dark brotherhood. all the quests feel so cookie cutter it takes out all of the fun.  I think that is the issue with western games. they use a cookie cutter approach.
if twitter users weren t anonymous soooo many would be getting sued for defamation.
you d think the average human wouldn t misinterpret your comment about elden ring. smh. oh well people like them helped me discover you so I guess its a net positive. wish I could catch your streams of elden ring. you make going back to the office bearable especially in the morning where Im from.
I dont understand getting upset over someone not liking something you do. have these people been sheltered their entire life...probably. Im offended someone tried to cancel someone I like  over something so stupid!!!
I ll never get why some get so butt hurt over difference in opinions. I have very different gaming likes than you. I enjoy modern tomb raider  I enjoy games that probably would fall under your tweet about being walking simulators haha  I prefer western games  but I can never get offended  be mad at or dislike someone for having and sharing a different opinion especially in regards to video games of all things. games are meant for entertainment and provide us fun and we can all play what we enjoy and still be friends if our opinions differ. love what youre doing with this channel  keep doing your thing!
besides the point  your hair looks really good mel really rockin that hair style
in the immortal words of taylor swift...  haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate .
that was a great passage  by the way. fits perfectly with the theme of the video.
imagine being so triggered by someone s video game opinions that you have to forge tweets.
thank you! and regarding your question  Imade a video about this when a pastor was blaming women for his sin. you can look at an attractive person  real or otherwise  without actively lusting. I go a lot more in depth in that video
thank you so much!
probably will never get seen. personally your vids are great to have in the background while I work. while not religious myself I appreciate someone who is unafraid to share their beliefs.
Imust say your hair is super super cute today!Im sorry about the jackasses on twitter harassing you
agree with all what the  she is pleasing to the eye  guy said...and yes  she is very....very pleasing to the eye I would say.
commenting to feed the algorithm  and for round 3. congratulations.  you can do it!!!
imagine having opinions lmao
congrats on getting to round 3 you deserve the cup  and faking obviously fake tweets are people that are subhuman in my opinion.  hmm so indy roll the boulder on himself
nice job getting to round 3 of the gfuel challenge!
imagine how mad they wouldve gotten if youdve thrown w Bible verse in there  their collective heads would ve
the struggle isn t left vs right  or whatever political labels are used. the problem is groupthink. the idea that you should  live your truth  is the key to dumbing individual thought. it may seem counter-intuitive  but the reason for this is that when forming groups  as humans are want to do  the importance of having the same opinion gets magnified when opinions are the foundation of reality. this yields a tightly knit identity with the group such that once the grouping is established in this way  groupthink begins taking precedence.others are readily believed on a multitude of lies  or fake tweets  as long there is alignment with the groupthink. in fact lies no longer matter within the group  just agreement with the group or not.this makes it easy for those groups to be manipulated by someone wanting to control the group  because you just have to pretend to be a friend to the group. cancel culture and so much more stem from those two facets  disagreement with some group  and group manipulation. so ironically  the first step to controlling someone is to train them to think that they are the God of their own reality.
your the health girl so Im just gonna askis gfuel keto friendly and is it worth buying
listening to your video literally while playing fire emblem to finally go through the golden deer story line... fuck yeah this is a good game! lol
any thoughts on completely covering both arms with tattoos
that tweet is how I found this channel lol
sitting here listening to this while playing knights of the old republic 2 sith Lords watching a fancy cut scene lolz
the boomers stand with you!
they just mad the melonie macenator spitting facts. keep up the great work.
Im still very much old school and despise how games  especially western made are like movies with overly long cutscenes. I also love fe three houses  which I do find has the prefect balance between storytelling cutscenes and far more important aspect  which is the gameplay. I dont play games to watch movies. different mediums  -
I wouldnt survive being a youtuber. I have a violent reaction when I see the ones I follow get attacked.. and I dont even know them
great video melonie. the verse of the day idea is great. may God bless you as you live for him. btw  what church do you go to if any
it is like riding horses in any game after riding horses in rdr2
golden deer are my fav yes!
@melonie mac go boom  Ive gone through the other options when the game came out  my main save says I have 272 hours even though a few of those are probably me falling asleep... lol. took months to finally come back and see how the things progress with claude and his schemes. overall its an amazing game though. picked up triangle strategy because it looks like its in the same vein as for emblem  political choices that matter and fun rpg.
I dig your vids...even as a pagan  raised catholic  libertarian  minarchist. aye. these are the end days. cheers to ragnarok.
see that proverbs tab opened up. you spoke about getting back into the Bible recently got me motivated to do so. has made a difference. God bless you
word.... japanese entertainment has better quality in their products than western media imo
mate your always rocking fire mha gear. good looks
you ain t going nowhere lady go boom
as a lover of og lara croft  I cant really see her being a technophobe  but I also cant see her being the sort to call for help every 0.2 seconds on her radio. she d no more be an ooga booga of tech than solid snake.
I haven t played sekiro either  but after elden ring I really want to. I played the hell out of bloodborne and it was amazing. haven t got into dark souls as much but I feel like its time to take them on.
congrats on top 16 and also you look very pretty today
I like your videos  there s no hate... but I do prefer shorter videos because there s just so much stuff I want to listen to and not enough time for everything.  maybe two channels   one longer streaming channel and another channel with produced and edited short videos made from the streamed longer videos
see  the first mistake was getting a twitter.
very beautiful hair style and neat shirt ... keep doing you girl
if you sue him for defamation twitter will comply and give you his identifying information. teach him a lesson  and set an example for every other piece of shit that thinks they can get away with it.
yes be happy melonie
I saw this title and my first word was  again  update   to be honest there are some double a games that are better than triple a games these days like little nightmares and the orI series. a little fun fact that the level designer for the designer for am2r is actually the level designer for orI and the will of the wisps  thats not even mentioning how triple a games tend to hold your hand like melonie metions
you rock!
I would love to play some ps exclusives... I d just need a playstation. or a buddy who lives nearby who has one.congrats on 25k!now if we could get most of them to watch every video!
some thoughts stalin once said that it doesnt matter how the people vote. it only matters who counts the votes. when people cant attack the message  they attack the messenger. a wwiI saying is   you know you are over the target when you star getting flack .  lady  you are over the target. even brother Jesus said that you would be attacked for believing. stand strong in your belief. stand strong in your faith. know that you are not alone. keep going boom.
that just means youre doing it right. keep it up  they ll keep trying too... its funand korea  south  is making great shit too.... squid game  all of us are dead
I subscribed !  still love your ink....keep up the content....do you hate me yet from the intense workouts    lol
youre making the right people big mad lol
dude am2r is wicked. loved it
@scottydu81  right  seriously I could very easily see if nintendo dropped their draconian methods and worked with team that made it  they could ve polished it up and made more money than sending a c d order that costs a lot of money an hour having it written up and good pr.multiple benefits to working with a passionate community than just shutting them down like that and make bad pr.
@m3tr01d86  at least they waited until it was finished and released
@scottydu81  technically they had a demo and nintendo did it and kept itsecret until it was done and someone pulled a han solo and was in an indie game awards at nintendo. then they had egg on their face when itshowed up in the public eye. not only that  they claimed it would  interfere  with the sales of samus returns. like hell it did in my book. I played both and love both.update  of course  not only did they not scoop up an opportunity  but they did it twice.
@m3tr01d86  at least metroid  dread was fucking perfect
@scottydu81   that is true especially when you are a bad ass female in that game but you definitely know when you need to fold the stay alive and complete your mission
just imagine all the haters are bosses on elden ring
crazy how quickly the  we must combat disinformation  crowd will resort to fake tweets to cause actual harm to a person oh    mel  honest opinion... what would you say to a lara croft fallout style game   tomb raider  new vegas.  just picture it.    that d be dope as hell right
liked and subbed  my dude
dude  nice gojI tat. keep up the good work.
yo! thats a super sick hoodie. I have a very similar tee-shirt.
I would like to personally thank melonie mac for taking the epithet  boomer   and totally redefining it to mean  an independent  cool  awesome  person with individual thoughts  and if you dont like it you can shove off . but enough of describing  this  boomer.
if you have to counterfeit hate to try to frame someone else as a hateful person  maybe you should stop for a sec and realize that the hate is coming from you.new subscriber to this channel.  I find your viewpoint refreshing.  great presentation of a real gamer s perspective.  definitely nice that your appearance triggers the crazy crowd.
damn girl  this hair looking cute as heck.
they think their game is   gonna say no given the way people have reacted to elden ring and horizon. there are people throwing shade horizon s way  get enough of that and you can either accept it or push back. so they are likely just a little sensitive for being rubbed raw. doesnt make them right  but there is no aloe for this kind of rampant verbal whiping.
9 40 the acting male pops up once again   he makes great videos on video games mel check him out
slander and falsehood are the tools by which their practitioners will fall.  the warrior scholar has spoken.
youre right about japan. they focus on gameplay. us developers focus on presentation. as a result japanese games are just better.
like what some politican said. they mad they cannot date you! lol
be cool if 4 chan took over twitter would be hilarious as hell             hail kekistand  !
just keep ignoring those dumn idiotsthat want to try to ruin you.your doing fabulous job in God we .I absolutely this chanel of yours for its place for yougetting you to be you.takecare melonie  jehova   you
I love elden ring  an honestly the aaa scene has been getting worse and worse each year. more monetization less game and less challenges. I love challenge and really want to see more with games. I spent so much time in dark souls and other games.
its easy to create fake anything online. windows clip tool  windows key   shift   s  select it  edit it  save and post it. easy. great tool for making thumbnails too. boom!
I love the old school lara croft in the background.
Im not really surprised its a horizon fan.some of that fandom seems to be pretty rapid.the slightest critique sets them off!
the simpage is strong with this channel. interesting.
problem is that boss fights that end in one hit aren t very fun. better off imagining a doom mod.
thanks for reminding me to play fire emblem  I need to finish my 3rd playthrough.
never played h-zero dawn but I d give it a try.
tech support scammers even use inspect element to spoof things for their scams not even hard.
I think indie aa games are the best atm. most aaa games are not taking big risks anymore and are sticking to what can make them money.  even elden ring really didn t  its just open world dark souls with good jumping and a horse  but its still uses a decade old combat system going back to demon souls which is kind of bland when compared to games in the same genre  such as nioh 2 or surge 2
well melanie to quote a saying from the beastie boys you gotta fight for your right to party
16 42 wait  really  ... oh boy  I just started playing that game. so I guess its going to be a wild ride  huh.
well I hope g fuel follow through better than what artesian builds did.....
twitter. this is all it is.
dont judge a game by its cover...if you want a hardcore hold no punches tomb raider esque experience  I would highly reccomend haydee. less so haydee2 which is more about shooting.
I saw this coming a mile away. these wokies can eff right off!!!
I get criticized all the time for my taste in games  but it is funny since the hate has a tendency to come from people who cant be successful using their  techniques  they ve mastered. for example  in ghost recon  breakpoint there is no trick stomping  wall banging  or quick scoping. you cant play it like call of duty or you will suck.
its odd how fragile people can be when it comes to video game opinions of other people. like  are they seriously that hurt by the fact thatsomeone else doesnt like the same game they do  Imean  I like jrpgs  but you dont see me trying to organize cancel campaigns against people who dont like the turn-based battle systems.
if you arent pissing people off  you are doing it wrong.
awesome mha tank!
I despise people who think it is okay to play with other people s lives.
thatspecific comment is the exact argument the xbots use to pretend like dont exclusives are literally glorified walking simulators.  God of war for example has 4 hours of cut scenes in a 30 hour campaign  and the bots act like its actually the opposite
Im still looking forward to legend of zelda breath of the wild 2  I still prefer the world of hyrule and the fact you can climb most things especially mountains.
let the salt flow!!!!!! boooooom!!!!!!
16 20 honestly I think the average conservative is a lot more libertarian than they think but   libertarian   and possibly minarchist  are still too scary strange words to many that I think if the  libertarian party merged with the republican party a lot more libertarians would be elected   under the name republican
let the booms drop!!!
the fact that you have trolls impersonating you and people falling for it is just further proof that your new channel is a success and the woke mob is butt hurt that youre growing so quickly. take pride in knowing that every time you gain a sub  the price of soy increases.

melanie mack go nowhere!!
playstation stans must ve taken that tweet of yours too close to heart since most of their exclusives are hand holdy  cinematic experiences .
lol Im already assuming it was referring to death stranding
people are mad because elden ring is one of the best games that has ever been made. great story  great exploration  great difficulty and amazing bosses. haters going to hate
I prefer a middle-ground myself. dont mind a challenge but also dont see the appeal of the souls games.
they dont attack the harmless. stay strong.
I like anime better than most anything we see on tv. you ve got yourself a subscriber  sister. amen.
when boomers hate someone who goes boom.
stay anti-woke! we love you and your spirited content. tweeter endorses fakeness on one side
red dead redemption and red dead redemption 2 is one of the best games ever made
2 15  3 20  ... you are awesome.
oh what tolerant people  so nice of them to create and present an alternate reality that justifies their hatred. people like that will always complain. in their mind they are fighting for justice in some fictional war  when in reality they are just getting big mac bits all over their keyboard.
I dont use twitter... go figure.
the only games that are worthy of having a bunch of long cut scenes was the metal gear series imho.
want a challenging game  play through the metro series on ranger hardcore  in russian.
if these are the steps the derange folk from twitter have to do for an opinion  then they re scum of the earth.
I honestly wouldn t recommend sekiro  so many of the decisions they made are anti-fun and the story is just   not good.still if you only played ds1 and 2 then have fun with bloodbourne  thats some good shit.
who else sees the jay-jay the jetplane in her profile pick  lol
what s a good gfuel flavor that is not jittery and no caffeine
elden ring does seem like a refreshing change of pace from games that give you a laundry list  quest markers and even protagonist comments to make absolutely sure you know exactly where to go and what to do. I dont mind these things  I just dont think itshould be in every game. people shouldn t take offense to an opinion because its just an opinion  and as far as I know  we re still allowed to have opinions.
they hate you cus they ain t you .
yeah some of these people are hating because of some of your conservative views.you can be conservative and not republican. I personally cant say I lean a specific way I as I am aware Im still educating myself on how goal post travel and society develops etc. but I do learn on core values of the constitution etc.
hes probably just mad that you platinumed his favorite game that he cant.
I have a policy that mostly  if what youre doing is pissing people off  youre probably doing something right.
if I had to guess that gus the businessman guy is a rabid playstation fanboy and I say this for a couple of reasons. first he did the same thing to act man after he made a video exposing just how toxic and obsessed console fanboys are. second you praised elden ring for being so enjoyable compared to current aaa open world  hand holding walking simulators  something sony games are known for. there s also the matter that elden ring stole the spotlight from horizon forbidden west and got a way better metacritic score  something that doesnt sit well with sony fanboys who have been review bombing the game.I got nothing against playstation games of course  they make great games and fanboys are ridiculous no matter the brand they worship  I just know the lengths that fanboys will go to defend their precious  especially playstation fanboys and gus is one.
them haters are just jealous
I like reboot lara no offense  but the hand holding is annoying. I remember in the classic era it was you and you alone. I looked up shadow a while back and saw that the devs wanted to explore the repercussions of a white privileged woman exploring and taking artifacts. listen shadow is set in my country I didn t give a fk about a fictional white character taking stuff I asked myself back then why is that necessary I just want to play a game. like what am I supposed to do  praise the devs for taking a stand  it reeks of fakeness. lara has gone to peru before shadow and it was fine with no virtue signaling.
guess its time to boom some haters  p
I love the bash on walking simulators.  tlou2 was so bad in so many ways  including the boring and forced walking every 4 seconds
yay  new shirt!
lol love the thumbnail
I have no idea why ppl are so obsessed with other people s opinions. you know how much I dont care  I ll say this full stop. I enjoyed anthem. I understand the mockery that comes with that take but I also dont care. why they d have such small pp energy to come after you for this is insane. also day 11 of me commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me. heck I ll even take raid shadow legends at this point.
I cant believe the age you say you are. unreal
somebody in twotter hq allowing this.
is it just me or do so many of the whiney response tweets look copy and pasted to anyway else  like they are more or less word for word identical. some loser went out of their way to make fake tweets and pretend that it was melonie who said them. wouldn t surprise me if they made fake accounts to make itseem like more people were angry than there actually was just to gain traction on the whole thing.
savethepixeltitties
haters gonna hate. the very bad thing here ist  that they try  to ruin your career   life  by contacting your sponsor. these people suck. -_-
so the guy talks bad about you liking japanese games  yet the game he likes is on the sony playstation a japanese company
anything from the hydration line has no caffeine. blue rocket pop is my fav  d
did you turn him down on advances
I like the hairstyle.  it is cute.
melanie did twitter give you a fake account   people commented on your fake acct.
hey mel I just want to let you know that and tell you that they are jealous bc they dont have a beautiful and amazing tattoo of laura croft on their arm and they are jealous too that they dont have a adorable and lovely pets like you do and they are not as cool and rad then you are  ok mel. anyway dont let them put you down and dont let them make you mad and sad too  ok. anyway just do what you want to do for yourself and dont worry about what they say about you bc I think that you are absolutely beautiful and lovely young lady and you are so cool and rad young lady too  ok mel. anyway I just want to let you know that and I just want to tell you that too  ok mel. anyway good morning mel. anyway I do hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home with your pets and at the gym too  ok mel.
if I were you  I d sue the guy for making those fake tweets. thats libel.
lara is hot chick indiana jones without ripping him off.
cancel peeps are back let them come Jesus is on your side. let your opinion be known.
cool channel
everyone here loves your boom boom
these folks have too much time on their hands.  dont like something.  dont follow  dont read.
do not.. simp  for  melonie   pls!
8 29 he didn t say  grace   worthless tweet  delete it
I dont get the reason to buy and drink g fuel  I understand it is health and a replacement for soft drinks  but if you dont drink soft drinks  what is the point
I never used twitter  why support a service like that  maybe nessisary if youre a youtuber or so
Ive never tried g fuel  what flavor should I try frist
crazy I had put away tomb raider 2 into my job inventory at work today n said to myself melonie is right classic lara croft was wayy better
boom!!! in their faces..
I only like my hand held by beautiful women  not video games. and cut-scenes are the reward for beating a game  they belong at the end.
if I could think of relevant scripture I would post it...Jesus did say we would get hate...
with more poeple like you maybe we come to an end someday with this woke bs
no one tells me who I can watch   ever  was here
hamburgers ! ! ! !

boom
people are stupid   everyone can have their own opinions
wow.  people getting desperate.  sheeeeeesh
how many crayons and paint chips did these wokies eat growing up...Imean getting older
gee...melonie s minions 3825 here... sorry for all the haters out there ya gotta put up with  someday cancel culture will be cancelled   keep up the great work....
nice
racist  - the term used when progressives want to shut down a discussion.btw  cool tomura shigarakI tank-top!
I really like you but not enough to get back on twitter.telltale games are awesome.  but I get it.  but like if I want to play a dishonored type game - then be one.  if I want to play a telltale game - then be one.also so we now live in a world where someone guesses that you might not like a video game they like so they try to hurt your brand
such jelly ppl
Jesus is Lord and he loves you God bless good luck
criticism of your favourite game is not criticism of you. touch grass
concratz
trying to destroy someone for a video game opinion is the absolute pinnacle of pathetic.  incon-th-eivable!
click click boom
maidenless
how pathetic and sad someone or a group of people needs to be if they need to make a fake tweet or fake tweets. yet again twitter is pathetic crybabies about opinions.
those who attack you were piperos
yes japan does it better.
let me get this straight those people were attacking a woman  where are the feminist to help you  v
for me its annoing because I like games such as elden ring and darksouls but the games are overall just to hard and annoing for me I dont wanna rage all the time because I get my ass kicked.on the other note I am a liberterian aswel to bad allot of libs arent as much for freedoms as the word means liberterian almost means youre an anarchist meaning as little goverment as possible and people are free to live life how they want aslong as you treat others with respect and dignity and if there is an issue it wil be solved by the community the other big problem is retarded woke people they are dangerous and cause social ilusions.annyway I like what eldeen ring is looks good and plays wel only the boss difficultie is usualy to much for me.youre the first you tuber I seen that quotes Bible verse its nice feels nostalgic for our home the kingdom of heaven while we are here on earth.
o o
didn t play resident evil biohazard or village. resident evil remake on nintendo gamecube barely has cutscenes and is hands down the best of resident evil survival horror. personally I prefer silent hill 1-3 to resident evil games. all of those listed games barely have cutscenes  all survival horror gameplay baby
ahhh  the tool of liars with no proof nor evidence to back up anything they claim.same kind of people who re always demanding acceptation  love and respect  but earns and deserves indifference instead.
yesheyahu  isaiah  54 1717 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper  and every tongue thatshall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. this is the heritage of the servants of adonaI  and their righteousness is of me  saith adonaI  yhwh .adonaImeans  the Lord  in hebrew.
this is who should have hosted g4tv lol. perhaps it wouldn t have tanked like it is. frostkiran is pathetic.
if anyone thinks at all you are racist. they have never seen any of your content. if they would just pay attention they would see how stupid those fake tweets are.
once again you get a slander campaign against you. what else is new  this happens far too much. these ppl are hateful for no good reason  are very mentally ill and need to cut the crap! also  that dude was a hypocrite for calling you a racist when he was literally being racist towards the japanese. I know you are not a racist nor a bad person. I know you extremely well. you are a incredibly good person. the most kind  caring  helpful  supporting and sweet person I know. you are my fav person. you dont deserve this crap and I hate seeing and hearing about you getting treated badly. I am beyond angry at this! these ppl are about to catch these hands!
we luvz you mel but I just have to ask  why are always shouting    I know a few people in my personal life  including an ex gf of mine who talk  really loud like this!!   I ll be like me  hey bud  what s up  good to see youfriend    hey  you too. im good! blah  blah  blah.... me    !!!
ignore the cowardly leftist mob
my comments seem to disappear from here. do you hate me  melonie
jus get off twitter hun  toxic af
boo! h8ters
I like your gaming content but the Bible stuff..... eh. bash those little ones heads on dem rocks. - quote from some Bible figure. its your faith tho and its required for casting builds.
this isn t shouting. if you think she s shouting then youre gonna be really surprised when she actually does shout. lol. this is just her talking voice and the way she is. and there isn t anything wrong with that.
@asinisterkiid  ok  I think youre taking my comment a little too seriously.  Im not going to have a back and forth over semantics. talking loudly is shouting but if you want to call it talking loudly  be my guest. Imade a light-hearted question about an objective observation because I genuinely find humor in and curiosity for why some people talk to people as if they are 50 yards away from you
I dunno why they disappear  I dont delete comments xd
@melonie mac go boom  let me try again. if you want challenging games and dont care for latest special effects  please do try strategy genre.
@mattI kuokkanen  sometimes youtube will void or auto remove comments  the void comments tend to be strange like auto deletes  however I feel like its a glitch and they sometimes show back up the next day.or yt is accidentally trying to delete comments that may sound too similar or sound like a advertisment.
@exigent spr.  I had named some games as recommendations  or direct links to them. cant do that  huh
@mattI kuokkanen  most likely  I dont know how yt moderates them  but they go a little crazy on accident mostly to target the porn spam bots presumably
first!!!
damn I thought you were a racist for a second after seeing those tweets  Im sorry for jumping to conclusions
