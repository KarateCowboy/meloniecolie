I like how  why not just give the fans what they really want   is a revolutionary positive idea that the producers and developers haven t seem to have tried lately. sounds nice coming from you when you say it too @melonie mac go boom. players and viewers need to give their honest opinions for the market to correct properly. keep up the awesome reviews. you look and sound great  too.
halo ce was literally designed as a cinematic experience so its perfect for a one-to-one adaptation.the cutscenes in each halo game are like movies themselves.all they would need to do is turn the gameplay sections into action scenes.
these studios need to have a super fan consult to point out inconsistences and lore issues. I nominate melonie for tomb raider.
I just wanted a live action halo to share with my non-gaming friends and family so that maybe they could understand why I care so much about master chief  cortana  and the halo story. sigh
the battle for melonie s head continues  as her hair grows ever more powerful!
how to do a successful halo tv series1  start the show with cortana explaing the war over clips showing what happened so people who dont know halo at all paramount  can can better understand whats happening.2  start the show where combat evolved began.3  stick with that.youre welcome paramount
instead of trying to build up a tolerance even though Im poisoning my body  how about I  just dont do it   thats the most direct and real take on alcohol drinking  yet you say itso sweetly lolthats exactly how Ive felt about alcohol for the past 12 years. after a couple years of being drunk daily  also doing whatever drugs were offered to me  and ending up in alcohol education classes because of a ticket  I took a good look at what I was doing and the people around me  in my social circle and in the alcohol classes   and realized that even if I never got  that bad  with drinking again  having alcohol as part of your life leads to certain patterns of thought and behavior that I didn t want in my life. simply put  drinking doesnt lead to anything good. it has no benefits other than recreational  fun . and when it comes to recreational activities... there s a ton of things to do without getting drunk or high. you have the choice to have those kind of things in your life  or just not. I dont want to be a person that uses psychoactive substances  so I dont. and being born again in Christ definitely has solidified me against ever seeing any appeal in those things again.however even after that realization it took a few years to stop drinking altogether  mainly because of my attachment to the social circle I was in. I believe thats the case with many people who see recreational drinking as normal. its not even so much that they love drinking  its more the situations that drinking gets them into that they enjoy. especially when casual sex is involved. when people have all these attachments around an unhealthy behavior  they just normalize the behavior and try to make you out as weird for not doing it. just another way in which sin turns this world into one big clown world.but as you say  let people do what they want. the Bible says what itsays and Im glad you chose this verse to put out there. God s word never returns void  and I pray whoever watched this is honest enough with themselves to see where the unhealthy excess is in their life.for me its probably gluttony that tempts me the most  but Ive been fighting to control my eating. you definitely encouraged me to keep going with that today
I disagree. doctor who fandom is in tatters.and with what rtd has planned  the franchise is dead and buried. but this whole destroying beloved franchises trend is systematic and deliberate. and hopefully  karma deals with these creatively bankrupt knuckleheads in time. halo is just another on the chopping block by these trolling cowards.they want to hijack and destroy all popular franchises we love.
halo 5 was serious wound. halo infinite was a flesh wound halo tv series is more torture than listening to lore videos of picard
Im old enough to have read starship trooper before the the movie came out. totally different premise but I guess itserved the agenda at the time. let s try forever war by halderman. that has a lot that reflects on current society
yes I would agree with taking weekends off. maybe record two videos on a weekday and then just release it on a weekend. you could always make a couple extra videos during the week if they aren t super timely like breaking news and then just release those on the weekend so it appears youre working everyday!  many of those daytime game shows like wheel of fortune would record like a week s worth of shows in a couple days and then take the rest of the week off.
forward onto dawn is a great halo live action movie. its one of the ways I think you can make a great movie from a game.
hey melonie  I just wanted to encourage you by saying that even your previous  verse of the day  segments are helping some of us. recently God revealed to me that I had an idol in my life  and I remembered the verses about the golden calf that youread in an earlier video. I didn t get much from those verses  or your thoughts on them  the first time I saw the video  but I got a lot from them on my rewatch! p.s.  smart move taking days off to avoid burnout.
growing up  I felt like I was the only one who didn t drink. the constant push to drink from friends and other family members made feel like I was this big weirdo. it got to a point that I could barely hang out with them  even online. never did drugs  and I drank maybe 4 times in my life. once with my cousins on my 21st birthday  then my ex made me drink with her the other three times. only that crazy demon lady could talk me into things I never really wanted to do. I just never cared for the taste or how it made me feel  and hearing how it can mess you up in the long road. alcohol did unfortunately take my uncles life starting from scoliosis of the liver  which he got better from  10 000 a bottle pills  then died a year later from stage 4 cancer in 2020. he had a full body scan after he was cured of scoliosis detecting no cancer. after that a bunch of my family members stopped drinking  and haven t talked about drinking since.
hey melonie. first of all thanks for what you do  Im not into the same kind of games that you are but I love how you take on the woke weirdness thats infecting everything with no fear! God bless you for that! Im curious as to what your setup is like as Im thinking of doing a channel myself. what kind of camera do you use  what kind of software are you using to get yourself and the screen on the video  sorry if this has been asked before. God bless  keep going and stay strong  not to mention gorgeous!   ps - screwtape letters is a fantastic book as all of lewis  books are. lots of humor  you ll like it.
I agree  mel. I never drank since my 2002 grad  even that was barely  and Im astounded by the narcotic culture that goes on around us.people finally didn t mind me staying clean now  but back then  you were looked at as a weirdo for not drinking.let me choose my own life and stop pressuring me  please.
I ll be honest. I was never a fan of halo myself. but hot damn  I really feel for my halo-bro s and broettes.   I too have seen favourite franchises being completely wrecked by progressives and morons.try to remember the past of the franchise and preserve it for others.
love that hebrews verse you shared  Lord knows that many of us need endurance more than ever  especially with the way many people are on the internet. thanks so much for sharing  melonie mac!
as much as I love watching your video s here  Im happy to hear that youre finally gonna start taking some time to yourself! Lord knows after a long week of work  its very easy to burn out! take care of yourself!!! thanks for all you do!!
I watched the whole series  and I gotta say the biggest issues I had with it was how they made chief act  how cortana is  controlling his body  and how he slept with the covenant girl. other than that I didn t mind things too much...but those are some really big issues. Im hoping that they listen to feedback from fans and season 2 changes things. its not like they could ve made changes since season 1 was already done..but hopefully changes happen. halo is the game series that means the most to me so I was honestly just happy to see it get a series  but without some changes idk if I d stick with it.
exactly
the problem is we ve already seen it before. now that gives zero excuse to go the same plot structure and mutilate it. halo is so massive they could have picked something else to tell for a story. harvest  human covenant war on earth  odst s  etc. but no  they took the mainline story with master chief and messed it up to fit normie expectations.
@silver scrumble  because bungie owns the rights to the  side story  content and microsoft owns the halo series content. halo has not been halo since bungie pulled the independence ripcord.
you just explained why nobody would make the exact same story since it was already done. I dont want to rewatch the story from the games with different actors what a waste of time lol. the show is nowhere near as bad as people are saying but they probable had high expectations which is setting yourself up for failure.
sounds expensive ...   time wise  Imean ...
@chrisestes859  I agree with you on that.
what with this  why nobody would make the exact same story since it was already done.   or  the problem is we ve already seen it before.  bs argument  the whole point of adaption is to do exactly that  but in a movie format. we do it for books like Lord of the rings harry potter  but it not ok if we do to a game    Im not asking to be a 1 1 recreation - but I also do not want it to be a shitty rendition like the amazon tv show...
exactly. but that would take creativity and competence. funny how fans who actually like the source material are more creative than the ones creating the show.
@chrisestes859  you just decried the existence of every movie ever made based on a novel  comic book  play  tv series and even other movies.
@american mike  I dont know where on earth you got the absurd idea that bungie still owns anything halo. in fact  bungie apparently never really cared for the side story content. microsoft owns everything halo. and while halo has certainly had issues since it transitioned to 343I  the rose tinted glasses everyone views bungie through is quite nauseating. in fact  a few of the things people blame 343I for actually started with bungie  people just dont realize.
I agree. I d like to be able to know if fan consultants were involved with production or not.so I d know which producers I d like to give my money to.
turn the gameplay sections into action scenes and redirect the length amount of them  add new scenes depicting some of the other characters - keyes  johnson  foehammer  jenkins etc - and what they were doing while chief was elsewhere  so the entire movie isn t following chief 100   which would be weird for a movie   tweak some of the existing scenes here and there to make them fit the movie format more  and use the same music  and youre done. they could even put some scenes of thel  vadammee  who becomes the arbiter  commanding the covenant forces on the ring from his ship as a villain  which would make his downfall in the opening of halo 2 even cooler to watch.its so simple its baffling that they cant pull it off.
@chrisestes859  the show is awful  and you blaming the fans on behalf of it is sickening.
@jade runner 2049  that would require appreciation for the series and actual creativity. something hollywood writers lack.
@jade runner 2049  no I didn t I replied to a guy saying that halo ce already has cinematic scenes and he said they should reuse that cinematography while filming the rest which is what I was talking about. taking a book that never had cinematics is not at the same thing.
@jade runner 2049  nothing I said was not a fact. if you can prove me wrong go for it. you might want to look into the outcome of bungie leaving and see what licenses they still have vs what they dont have.
they had a great book they could have adapted that was faithful to the material.  it covered the spartan program and when the chief and cortana were put together.  then lead right into ce.
@mad_amos  I always wasted the original trilogy of books to be turned into a show. too bad they went opposite
@mad_amos  the books were fantastic
hell  it doesnt have to  and most dont want it to be  about the games events either. at least  not from master chief s perspective
its better to just think matt smith was the end and the doctor had the normal amount of regerations. you will sleep easier.
@butters66  my sleep is fine as is. and the doctor ended with the husbands of river song. the perfect ending. after that is an unnecessary content supplier.
yeah. they claim fans are  toxic.  when really its them. the are rude  narcissistic  and vicous. they want to  fix  anime. but the hate it. whether its how a female character looks. or isn t the pre-approved narrative. like the tolkien fandom is saying about the rings of power series.   evil cant create  only corrupt.
over the years  it has been hard seeing ips I love be slowly destroyed.  but the halo show was devastating.
admittedly  the starship troopers movie is quite stupid compared to the book.but hollywood liberal paul verhoeven tried to make satire out of the book. but in the end he made the terran federation seem pretty based and awesome anyway.
hey melonie  just heard that youre taking classes for nutrition and personal training. that is great  I think you would be amazing at that. Ive been saying for a while to other people when I tell them about you  that I thought you would be a great nutritionists and or trainor. like always love you channel. I really feel blessed by God that he directed me to you. plus  I feel this world is better and blessed with you in it. so  thank you very much  and I look forward to see what God shows us through you. hope you have a great day.
I liked classic lara. I also liked the remake lara in the first game. she was an underdog survivor. she was out of her element and learned how to survive over the course of her adventure. it made me cheer for her throughout the course of the game. but after the first game  she was no longer a scared rookie just struggling to survive. and without that angle  there wasn t much left to her personality to really make her journey interesting. in other words  her situation was interesting  but her core personality doesnt stand up when you take her out of that interesting situation. nathan drake can pull it off because he s a mountain of charisma. classic lara can pull it off because she s a badass femme fatale. without thatscared underdog element  new lara is a pretty boring character on her own.
was able to attend one of melonies stream last week and it was fun spoke to a bunch of cool people and melonie is fun to watch the way she has a concentration face is serious on top of thatshe got me playing slay the spire now
its refreshing to see how you have a normal relaxed take on the craziness that is the world today. its also refreshing to hear the Bible verses at the end as it reminds me of the Bible study sessions I used to have with a friend who s now a pastor. keep up the good work wish you on the best with your nutrition studies.
I dont understand why art has to be inclusive. usually when an artist makes art movie novel video game  they make the things they want to make or what they like  it doesnt have to include anyone or anything specific. so if someone wants  inclusivity  they need to just make their own art  they can make their own things the way they want to make it  thats kinda the point of making your own stuff anyway.
congrats on the new classes! learning more about fitness changed my life for the better
love this video bashing the halo bs came out on my birthday and is the first video I am seeing from you. your hair rocks  I am not a tomb raider fan so I cant comment on it but sounds like you have it down so good luck. I second youreading the screwtape letters  amazing book. its always awesome to see Christian content creators in these areas of entertainment so I dont feel crazy for liking any of these games and shows. you seem like you would be fun to discuss scripture with too as odd as that might sound.
thanks for thwarting attempts to rewrite the real lara!      halo games cut-scenes put together make a great movie.     need a strong black character   how about my second favorite halo character  sgt avery johnson.   watch  aliens  johnson was a spartan-I  historically .      Im certain every actor   actress has a  no helmet  clause in their contracts.    spaceship leaking   fire in a small ship   tools flying around   dont use that helmet!   dont wear that expensive armor either.    just terrible.
I was  10 when it came out  but I have very fond memories of the original 1995 mortal kombat. 34 now  and its still a favorite. sure it has issues  such as casting a french actor for raiden  and a lack of gore to make a pg13 film ... but it was a decent explanation of the plot of the game  showcased all the original characters  and didn t force an audience-insert character to serve as plot explanation. when they say that video game adaptations dont work  they are wrong. mortal kombat had decent success here.  I admit  I have yet to see the most recent one . surprisingly  so did sonic.
if you do audible I highly recommend the screwtape letters audiobook by ralph cosham. he does a wonderful job. the c. s. lewis hole is deep and meaningful but brutal and unapologetic.
I am of the firm belief that the phrase  it wont translate  is code for  I cant inject my vision into this .
rest is important  take those breaks. and  representing Christ on you channel is a noble deed as a Christian and as a fellow Christian  I am glad I found your channel.
as a Christian  I have to thank hollywood for destroying my fandoms   they smashed my idols for me.I have a book suggestion   this present darkness by frank perettI since you like angels battling demons.  it is a work of fiction  but if you want nonfiction unseen realm by michael heiser.
me and all the other trans gals I know prefer the feminine types in girls in games and comics  cause thats the look we strive foralso I like your natural hair  it looks nice  you do the best you
there s nothing wrong with your natural hair melonie. it looks great
I was never a tomb raider fan but I wouldn t mind seeing a  remaster of the legacy of kain series with the deleted content. I will say that the voice acting and music in thatseries is practically perfect and I cant see them replicating that
screwtape letters  and anything by c.s. lewis  is good but if you want something that gets into more details you should check out the unseen realm by michael heiser.
hImelonie I tried to watch halo it didn t draw me into continued to seeing it.you deserve to take breaksyou certainly have lot on your plate.thats great your going for a degree take your time takecare melonie
please take the weekend off! its good for your health!its very funny because around the time of the premier I believe  343 kind of washed their hands of it  said it was another alternate timeline  not associated with the game at all. that told me all I needed to know lol if the studio that has been developing it for years says  not our game or bungie s.  then you know its gonna be a mess
you know  its really easy to ignore when something you dont like occurs.
sjw s cant create. when they do we get new warriors or I am not starfire.
hey mm  could you also set up a channel for your videos on an alternative new tech platform like odysee or rumble  where your vids will stay up  or can do exclusive uploads that go into no-no topics  some of us dont really want to support youtube  based on its current policies.
melonie mc please read this. I dont care what anyone says about the series I think its absolutely beautiful  except for the kwan ha subplot. and Im a huge halo fan  Imean that ring reveal was so so beautiful  and master chief fighting all those brute chieftains at the same time was epic  and I love the tv series s look for cortana she s so cute and beautiful  also master chief is not dead trust me  he took a fatal blow from atriox and went unconscious  and also the latest halo game is gold especially the campaign  and in my opinion halo is not even as close to hopelessness as the tomb raider franchise is  no offense lovable melonie.
I agree. I spent last weekend fishing and playing survivalist. I cant deal with social media anymore.
so they re saying that a massively popular story presented in audio-visual format  wont translate  into... the audio-visual format !
based on my researchs for my video everything wrong about the halo show part 3  I realized people making the show didn t understand the source of material because they didn t want to use it  they wanted to craft their own stuff using only the ip. none of the people involved was invested into the project  all they wanted is a paycheck. no wonder why one of the two biggest credited writers left the project in the middle of it. based on my researchs their past experiences were all about making dramas and halo is no drama so its just natural they will fail adapting an fps if they pick people that made dramas in the past.
suddenly halo 5 looks a lot better thanks to this show. I think I will finally start my legendary run.
I saw a reddit thread a week or two ago about the halo show originally being a mass effect adaptation  but the producers couldn t get the rights to me  because their script was shit and ea actively doesnt want to make money legitimately  so they switched the names around and went to halo instead.
you dont have to explain why you need the weekends off. go do you we all know everyone needs their break from things to rest and regenerate. we will still be here come monday take care
sonic the hedgehog  am I a joke to you in all seriousness  though  I think filmento made a pretty compelling point in his video about sonic 2. video game movies often fall into one of two categories  either they change everything and piss off the existing fanbase while confusing noobs  or rehash plots and set pieces that you can already watch online or play yourself  making the film redundant. filmento argues that the sonic movies work because they take elements from the games  but build entirely new plots and set pieces around them. yes  we ve seen sonic snowboard down a mountain before  but only sonic 2 gives you this particular snowboarding chase. yes  we ve seen sonic and knuckles fight before  but only sonic 2 has this one.halo the series is what happens when a studio tries to pull a sonic but ends up with a resident evil. sure the elements are there. master chief  unsc  the covenant  but they ve changed everything so fundamentally that it isn t halo anymore.
ohh I relate to the drinking part so much people act dumbstruck that I dont drink and have no plans of it!
I think thats why im still a sonic fan and how both movies exceeded all my expectations.
I strongly believe most  video game to tv   movie  adaptations are not for the fans  but to make a  relatable  tv series   movie to the non-gamers. I personally have never played a halo game. I have no idea what the universe is or what it is about. Imight actually like the halo series  never seen it  but Imight like it. ya know
it wont translate  means we cant make the movie match the game because the story was already told in the video format and we want  fix  the story. the video game story is already being told in a video format and they want to sound like they are original
your description on why you shouldn t do certain sins was accurate. the rules God make isn t for him its to help us when your are habitually sinning with no remorse you are hurting others and yourself and also living for sin is linked to idolatry as in sex  drunkeneess  gluttony and things can be considered Gods in peoples lives which God forbids. also I see and realize everyday why God tells us to save sex for marriage  just sleeping around causes all types of misery and pain
imagine giving actual consumers what they want. revolutionary.
poor halo....also  your hair looks amazing as you have it now!
definitely down for you taking a break for yourself on the weekends. we can get by with games or whatever.also  if you want butchered adaptations...I give you mortal kombat annihilation. or warcraft. thats just...uh...yeah.
her hair is naturally curly !  damn  0 go girl
miss mac  please dont start drinking. take it from an alcoholic  its not worth it. and alcohol is social acceptable because of   a- its the easiest escapism substance  to get and b- therapy sucks  is looked down on generally  especially for men  . and in my experience within the marines  excessive drinking is normal. getting help for it is not and will get you made fun of for talking to a shrink.
you should read  this present darkenss  - its a fictional book about spiritual warfare I think you d enjoy! deals with the concepts of deception and hiding in plain sight among other things.
translation  ahem  duhhhhhh- we lack creativity and are only adapting it to get people to watch it-duuur.  or they think they can make it  better  due to thier massive ego.

halo tv shill   games just dont translate to series. red vs blue  !literally the longest running american science-fiction series of all time!Im not saying anything about the quality of the seasons  and technically they aren t in fact adapting the games  only doing an extended fan-fic using props from the games  so to speak. just like the live-action series. except with  y know  quality writing occasionally  and actual fun as a goal sometimes achieved. and a love for the fandom.
at time of watching this halo video you have 34.3 subs. halo  343. is it a stretch of a coincidence  absolutely  but it gave me a chuckle!
exactly completely agree with your interpretation the word of God gives us the highest quality of life we can have on the earth.
not that our opinion matters  but I think most of us dont mind your hair one way or another. keep up the great content!
well if thats what you have to do melonie.. will miss the dailies though. maybe you can do a little poll or something on the weekends  tr polls please! . you know  so youre kinda still here while not being here at the same time. food for thought.
I dont drink! makes me completely sick too mel! I absolutely hate drinking! Im 100  on your side with the not drinking!!!
it doesnt translate 1 1  just means  Im too lazy to try and need this ip to be my personal play dough.
I drank heavily in my 20 s  have been sober since 29  way better quality of life now.
they dont hate the fans. they have an agenda and they hate people going against it.
got took off because itstuck to the source material that made us read the books in the first place. same with the lotr movies. perhaps just try to get someone who likes the material to be the show runner in the first place and see what happens
seriously  take weekends. any job where you consistently work 7 days in a row is abusive. doing it to yourself isn t any different. you have an a-hole for a boss.
star wars  hold my blue milk
weird how they assume there are  big sets of people who arent fans of any current ip but are just waiting for new material from a star trek who rings thrones superhero alien terminator to become fans of. they dont seem to get the people maintaining these franchises are fans of whatever and they want fan service to a certain degree.  they dont want your story they want their story to be told in a new way. they dont want their hero heroine to be race sex swapped.  they want more of what they loved before.
0 41 last time I took classes for nutrition I ended up with less on my plate  not more.
10 00 - in future videos  could you move the text box to the left  so we can everything would suggest shrinking your...umm...face box     to make room  but I wouldn t dream of it. btw  your natural hair looks amazing. definitely no need to  nuke  your hair with a straightening iron.
if game companies can make movies out of their games  the walking simulators and theatric pieces like death stranding  then hollywood has no excuse for doing a faithful 1 1 recreation of a game into a show or movie. hell  japan has beaten them to the punch with some anime adaptations like persona 3  4  5 and danganronpa.
it wont translate    we need to justify our jobs so we ll butcher this beloved ip because we think we can do it better
you know what should be the least likely to translate well to the big screen is sonic  but guess what  yeah  you already know what. gg.
video games dont translate!  my answer  sonic the hedgehog.
ya know  I had the thought recently about what if kojima made a tomb raider game  I think that would be dope.
good idea  I will have to try that! or perhaps I can film stuff in advance for weekend videos too
@melonie mac go boom  I still wanna see some tr gameplay from you.
yeah but hollywood is more focused on  the message  and money. over quality. but itseems people are getting tired of preachy entitled celebrities and wokeness. so maybe the world can go back to normalcy and common sense.
I dont think they hate gamers  I think they simply dont care. they care about rushing as much shit out as quickly and cheaply possible so they can make the quick money. 20 semi-profitable productions can be more profitable than 5 well researched and properly funded ones.
I wish I paid to watch halo  so that I could ask for my money back.
I dont understand  why dont they just copy the entire story from the games scene by scene and make it into a 3 hr movie format.is it that hard  or am Imissing something
it wont translate  aka  I dont want to put the effort in to learning canon  or  Im a big hollywood guy  I know better than some stupid video game studio  and or  it must include the message
there is a rare exception with the league of legends tv show arcane  compared to the game.
ah yes  the old  subverts expectations  therefore  it is good defense.  we have dismissed that claim.
they have nothing but contempt for the fans.
I have a theory  actually..two theories  and it applies to all of the franchises this has been happening to.  you have a whole bunch of writers out there coming up with crap stories that cannot stand on their own because...well... they focus more on the  message  and not on telling a good story.  to get people  interested  they package it as a  live action adaptation of  existing established property   with all the visual elements you expect in the adverts and special effects  but once you strip away those touch stones  the story doesnt fit with established lore.  ie  its bait and switch.the alternative is that these are someone with connections thinking their fan fic is worth tossing years of canon and established lore by the wayside because they can make it  better .not sure which is worse...
shout out to bolverk. he s a good follow.
melonie  considers reading c.s. lewis on how demons work against Christianssomething   quick  rub the cat s fur backward  hurry!
they could just have copy pasted any of the games or the stories available and people would have loved it making paramount untold millions no doubt.instead after years of waiting we got this  some woke power-point presentation for people who dont even watch it.
oh  and for the record  I disagree with the other guy  your hair looks good with its natural curl and volumethat being said  you do you  I straighten my beard so Im the last person to say do or dont straighten curly hair
you should always want to do things that improve your quality of life not just do things for convenience or ease. I was nearing 300lbs and put in effort into making a change for the better and getting into shape  working out and diet. if you dont like something make the active effort to change.
as someone who s also spent some time away from God  I can attest that life with him is better than life without. Ive been there and back  and its a much darker world over there. happiness can be found in him.
I grew up playing halo. halo 4 was the first I ever played. I dont care what the say they hate the source material. they hate the fans. anime fans never bend the knee to these people. these are the same people who make fun of you and cosplayers. thier too cowardly to stand up to those who resist.
I dont think they translated this adaptation  one to anythign. and you left out the part where cortana played mc better than mc. hologirl power I guess.
weekends off is amazing.
all you need to know about how much critics hate fans can be seen simply by comparing their coverage of the halo series with their coverage of the sonic the hedgehog movies. they loathe content that respects fans and lore  and doesnt care about messaging. go boom!
instead of taking the weekends off  maybe you should take the break mid week since big companies tend to release embarrassing statements late fridays.
I lean more to pagan side of things in terms of religion  grew up Christian however. I do appreciate the verse of the day though. you can learn something from anything. recently read through the book of revalations.
it doesnt include  the message.  halo has a pro-human view where humanity is fighting against genocidal alien zealots. with these talentless hacks the aliens would be the good guys and would be postmodernist cynical. thats why they hate anime. cares more about a good story than propaganda. thats why manga is out-selling comics.
sadly  the first one is not a theory  thats actually what s been happening  but there s more to it and I would recommend watching this video https   www.youtube.com watch v xsijz7yqpyI this guy gives some insight on what s been going on.
well its not theories its the truth. to paraphrase critical drinker   made for children in adult bodies  by children in adult bodies.
I like the halo show  but its definitely more of adaptation of the books then the game
all the positive reviews from journivists are using that term  subverting expectations.  its actually quite telling.
aa and na are the same way. they can work for everyone for any problem  but only if you stick to the rules and stay honest
melonie bingo   let me tell you about the tomb raider  xdbut seriously your natural hair look great. anyhow  its your hair  you know best how you like it
I like the screenshot for this video -- its a nice look. you should keep it.
Im laughing imagining melonie having to pretend that fruits and vegetables are healthy to pass her nutrition class. just try not to pull out your hair in frustration  melonie.
amazon s lotr would like a word
game journos are just mad that they aren t real journalists  if those even exist anymore
1 on the screwtape letters recommendation.
the gaming journo probably didn t or cant play the game.  same with the series producers and writers. they are more interested in pushing their own ideas and beliefs instead of staying true to the canon. they dont give a rat s patoot about the fans  and then wonder why their show fails.
this is why I stick to anime cuz anything else just disappoints.
hey melonie  have you ever watched the cooper stuff podcast  I think you would enjoy it!
im very happy that you turned back to Christ we are only a few months apart in age  1986
when you have disney buy halo come talk to me.
but I saw some clip thatsaid halo is one of the most popular series out there  surely they wouldn t mislead us  dang  maybe we need biden s misinfo bureau!
their leveraging fan hate for publicity to acquire a larger fan base - despite the two to be mutually exclusive
wait. was that a joke or did they actually kill chief n have cortana take control...tell me that isnt real
the whole fandom has been taken over by softies and soyboys ever since bungie leftImiss the old days
the hair looks drip af
series that would never  absolutely not ever  translate well to film or tv- any first party sony game on ps4- final fantasy- xenoblade xenosaga xenogears- trails- ys- atelier- okami- fire emblem- golden sun- nI no kuni- deus ex- any visual novel
thanks so much! testing different things and was gonna a see if y all liked this style
@melonie mac go boom  please read this. I dont care what anyone says about the series I think its absolutely beautiful  except for the kwan ha subplot. and Im a huge halo fan  Imean that ring reveal was so so beautiful  and master chief fighting all those brute chieftains at the same time was epic  and I love the tv series s look for cortana she s so cute and beautiful  also master chief is not dead trust me  he took a fatal blow from atriox and went unconscious  and also the latest halo game is gold especially the campaign  and in my opinion halo is not even as close to hopelessness as the tomb raider franchise is  no offense lovable melonie.
I think you went too far the other way. natural sugar from fruits is the best sugar for an active day  along with protein. lettuce is the only vegetable I wouldn t recommend.
bahahaha right ! ! Im dreading that part
vegetables have antinutrients and fruit is at best is tolerable for the active  but far from good for you
its real. Im not even a halo fan but this is like star wars sequels bad if not worse
@bahamut zero  lol 100  chief isnt dead cortana said she didnt know if she could bring him back  but obviously she will somehow show is very predictable.
@chrisestes859  chief flatlined  he s categorically dead
@spitshinesneakers  chief will be brought back next season with some kind of scientific justification akin to altered carbon. there is no show without john so its easily predictable.
at this point I dont consider anything in form of tv or big screen adaptations as canon for any of my favourite books or games.it is clear that the screen adaptations are at best amateurish unskillful moneygrabs  and at worst deliberately maliciously  reimagined .either way  we can always choose not to watch. no one is forcing us.
if they think its so untranslatable  then why the he ll even attempt to adapt them at all
the show is mostly noise. combat  people stomping around in loud boots and space ships flying about. I was bored and didn t finish the first episode. not worth my time. on a different topic  have you considered sharing what you are you are learning in your nutrition class  I wouldn t mind hearing some nutrition information and it might be a way for you to review the material i.e. study time. a little double dipping. and finally  I was wondering which hair style was your natural  although you are attractive with any hairstyle you choose. also intelligent  insightful and spiritual. quite the package. anyway  thanks for sharing your time.
this isn t a halo problem but hollywood itself. they love crapping on every franchise they touch. prioritizing virtue signalling rather than respecting the lore.
I would love to never hear or read subvert expectations again when it comes to ips.
as a halo modder I find this very shitty situation but whatever modding haklo engine is fun and a nice stepping stone for my education
why!!!!!!! I love the halo lore but this is garbage!!! shame on paramount for doing this. fyI  your hair is rockin.God bless and keep doing what you do!!
this guy clearly hasn t seen arcane. you can do a videogame adaptation and make it good  you just need to respect the characters.
natural hair looks good
they keep bringing up the one to one argument against me anytime I complain about what they did with final fantasy seven remake  dont know what your thoughts on that one were  but for me I am angry as  well a word I probably shouldn t say on this channel. it was a complete and total mess  but I will get off my soapbox. but anytime Imention that  its always you wanted the one the one remastered. no I wanted something faithful to the original. I dont understand why people cant understand that there is a difference between wanting something thats faithful  and a complete one to one. our people really thatstupid that they dont understand the new onto the argument there  honestly I think the answer is yes  yes they are thatstupid.
the halo tv series is the gold standard for video game adaptation. crikey! what must their standards be like also  if you dont think it will adapt  dont adapt it! let someone with actual skill or knowledge of the ip  or better still who actually likes it!  adapt it.speaking of which  has anyone here seen the film  forward unto dawn   now that was a good adaptation!
Im completely indifferent to the show. I wouldn t even afford it the steam off my pee.
alcohol is not bad for you. if you drink a little its actually great for your health. too much or anything is bad for you.
nutrition classes   please try not to get triggered when the vegans sound off  haha.
wait...a show that doesnt follow the game canon is somehow the gold standard for game adaptations   thats absurd.  that  journalist  should be ashamed of themselves.
I thought motu was bad. each remake is more woke than the previous. halo is now in the top slot. I wonder who the next victim will be
only thing  enhanced  are master cheek s cheeks
didn t the halo showrunners brag about how they purposefully did not do any amount of tangible research about the ip  I hate this mentality in modern media. youre adapting an existing property  at least make it jive with the original. they cant keep getting away with appropriating franchises. all they re doing is creating their own woke trash   slapping that coat of paint over the top of it for brand recognition when in reality they re just pissing off the actual fans. its happened time   time again and Im just sick of it at this point  Im not even a big halo fan in this instance. sure  I had my fun with 1   2 in college but beyond that I haven t stayed with the franchise.
lovely new hair style!
adapting a video game can never be a one-to-one scenario...  yeah bullshit. I get that the witcher is a book series first  but their adaptation to a series was pretty freaking good. the halo movie was done very well  especially when it originally done as a 4 part short-film series .dota 2  dragon s blood  is a fantastic series that used primarily game lore to create a narrative. the league of legends series was praised by long time players of the game.people thatsay that absolute falsehood of a statement dont know the game  dont care about the game  dont appreciate the lore the game creators spent countless hours on  and or dont understand that there are die-hard fans of the franchise that would gladly work for basically  if not actually  free to see a film series stay true to the game s . like  I wouldn t hesitate to be part of the reason a series was praised by fans for being true to the lore even if I did it for free and or no credit  because I want to see the series succeed in all ways it can. hell  thats why henry cavil threw his weight around to have shitstick to the witcher s lore. he understands that fans wont like the show if you just take the already-present script and just throw it in the trash.I swear  these fools think fans get mad because we are anti-woke  I just want to see an accurate portail of the franchise... why is thatso hard
also forward unto dawn was a great movie. not sure why we couldn t get a sequel. the writers were actually competent.
as a whole  the witcher series was a pretty decent adaptation  I enjoyed itso far. there were some issues  certain plot points got shuffled around  etc. but my main gripe was the diversity casting for a good chunk of the characters. the showrunners ignored some very well laid out character descriptions from the books and race swapped them for the inclusion factor. geralt  cirI  vessemir   jaskier are like the only book accurate castings that I canthink of off the top of my head. while everyone did a phenomenal job in their roles  no complaints about anyone s acting   can we just respect the polish roots of the series
it bugs me so much when filmmakers use the excuse of  video games dont translate well into movies . no  they re just too lazy  not creative enough and probably dont care about the franchise enough  to do the research and put in the effort to make it good! they need to stop trying to  improve  what is already there with the source material  or make it relatable by putting the video game into the real world  instead of just using the already amazing world the game is set in that made itso popular to begin with. it really isn t that hard  they just want to complicate things more than it needs to be. give the fans what they want and the rest will work itself out. sorry for the long rant lol.
@melonie mac go boom     imho   wear your hair however you want.  also imho    less is more.
the halo tv series is honestly insulting to those of us who have been around since the bungie era days of the franchise. I cancelled my subscription in the middle of episode 6. lol
halo is now the most butchered fandom ever .who didn t see this coming
the amount of hate Ive felt for this show has been unreal. Im not a huge super fan of halo  but holy fuck  was it abysmal. this is the first tv show that Ive actually ranted about  and Ive seen bits of batwoman.
Ive given halo a chance  just treating it like an original show.  the kwon stuff is kinda meh so far  slow and wierd  but Ive enjoyed the master chief spartan combat quite a bit.  overall  without expecting it to be canon  I d give it a 4.5 10. it has enjoyable moments  but will never be a favorite.
tomb raider is fine. it was a great series.
halo is a mere child. it can recover someday  maybe. the holy trinity of wrecked   is star wars  star trek and doctor who. the tragic one is star wars. carry peter   and kenny are gone.  there is no way to ever have the ogs back together again. that is what I called wrecked and butchered. at least halo was a video game and its voices that are behind it. star trek and doctor who have been trashed to hell as well. just sad! now the slow wait for the demise of lotr. we might be living in the end times. lol! thanks for the video melanie.
@melonie mac go boom     Imay have posted a similar comment under another video of yours.  thatsaid   do whatever you need to do to take care of you.  we understand...
while I do agree people shouldn t be stigmatized for not drinking  I also think responsible drinkers shouldn t be denigrated either. Imyself drink. not excessively but I do. and remember what Jesus said. its what comes out of us that defiles us. we shouldn t judge fellow Christians for drinking or not. its their choice.
let me correct the title for you  halo is now the most butchered fandom so far . and the woke adaptations aren t stopping.
I guess you haven t seen bloodrayne xp
do people really look at you like a freak for not drinking  I used to think that  but when I paid attention to people around me  I dont think I have ever seen that. I see it when people start chastising people who drink  because thats annoying  and there is no reason for it. drinking and drunkenness aren t the same thing. drinking isn t a sin. Jesus  first miracle was turning water to wine at a wedding feast and at the last supper  the cup he blessed and passed around wasn t filled with grape juice  it was wine. as to health issues  thats an individual issue. I have members of my family who are alcoholic  so they no longer drink at all. Im not an alcoholic but I have a scarred liver  so I dont drink much at all... some people have no problems at all with it.
hair looks great
I gotta disagree this fandom has been broken up a long time ago after 343 got a hold of halo and butchered the story in-game and the show itself is non-canon so people can step over it.
I like the show for what it is. a well-put-together fanfiction. created by someone whos older brother would not let them play... just watch and not ask to many questions.1  the face reveal was early. but in the story it made sense. did I like it  no but it was not a reason to hate the show.2  how would someone act once they removed an emotional inhibitor that has been there for decades only to find out everything was a lie  this could have been done slower.3  every single male that played halo and more than a few women thought  what happens when master chief wants to smash  is cortana there   why so mad over answered questions 4  mc isnt dead. stop  just stop guys. you all know he will be back.5  how will cortana complete her  I am fully on team master chief  story arc if she does not find a way to bring him back to life  or  what if  we have been playing cortana the whole time I struggle to believe thatsome of you halo tv show haters have actually watched the show in its entirety.
halo tv is so bad.  went from master chief   master cheeks   master queef finally to master zombie.
lol im so glad I wasnt there to back seat sts
your hair is amazing
I love the hair bro
you mean the 10 minutes of combat throughout the whole series
I will give it a 7 10 I really enjoyed in except for the keon ha stuff!
I never said we should judge people for drinking  I simply said it was unhealthy.
@melonie mac go boom  Im glad you agree. to be honest Ive dealt with judgmental Christians before so I dont like it when people think youre a  bad Christian  for doing certain things. our relationship with Jesus Christ is a personal one. far be it from anyone else to go after other Christians and act like they know what God thinks of them.
the show is awful bro
youre not allowed to like this show
I completely agree with you man
apparently they like wasting money.
love the hair
Im too new to halo to have an opinion. Im more of a doom guy lol
boom!!
God they truly fuck everything up!!!!!
modern games are 1 3 cinematic cut scenes. what part of cinematic doesnt translate to the cinema
boom!  what s up chicky !!!
literally the only good choice they made was the show not being canon just imagine the damage these fools might have done to actual halo canon.
hey good morning melonie I just want to tell you that I am sorry if this is late comment from your show from yesterday but I just want to tell you that I have not seen the halo tv show series ever but I have played the video game and so I just want to tell you that I love the halo video game and the people who make the halo tv show needs to just stop and do with out the show bc I saw the preview of it and I have to say that it looks dumb and stupid and they have destroyed the whole story line of the halo video game saga. anyway I just want to tell you that and tell you that I have played the video game of halo but I have not seen the show but I have seen the previews for the halo tv show series  ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment on your video from yesterday and I just want to tell you that I am sorry if this is late comment from yesterday  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today melonie.
the problem with so-called game journalist is they are not gammers..the went to school for journalism and are not imparchal they are advocates and dont care about fans..
here s cgp grey s study on adjusted workweeks in the contemporary yt world where a wednesday off may be more optimal. https   www.youtube.com watch v alatm6vztbw.   as for halo.  its a halo skin over a shelved mass effect script and poorly executed across production.  burn it.  buy out the franchise license  and try again in15years when the millennials are in need of a nostalgia trip.
I guess you never saw bloodrayne.
gj
fuuuuckk everyone needs a weekend
this is clearly hellno the master cheeks edition  no correlation with the actual franchise- looking at you microsoft  cut the tether while you can!!wish they d stop  subverting  and start  meeting or exceeding  expectations!!! cant translate  cough redvsbluecoughforwarduntodawncoughsticktothedamnlore
u look fantastic
I thought the Bible was ok with alcohol
nursing
im a recovering addict  from heroin  crack  cocain  all the craziest shit. I will say in my opinion alcohol is by far the absolute worst most damage causing drug
Ive been sxe for most of my life so fuck drinking lol
doom 64 is still one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. I bought it on the ps store back in 2020 and brought back so many great memories.
@randy riley  thats a tough one! I recently beat it on a n64 emulator  its a great game. is the re-make brighter  that was the main complaint  its way too dark lol
@max willson  it pretty much was the exact game. same graphics etc.  I was kinda disappointed in that. I thought it would be updated a little. there were a few bonus rounds that connected to the 2016 doom but even that part was true to the original.
the halo show is worse lol
good video- but nobody  and I do mean nobody  hates their fans with the same intensity and viciousness as current day marvel comics.
melonie   pokimane
trans women love the hyper feminine characters of course they do because they re guys.
I dont ever want to see me in any game or movie... book heiI I dont even wanna see me in the mirror... ugly af lol no thanks give me a beefcake and a lara croft like I dont get ppl who try to make themselves in games  and I like myself so shut up its a joke well its not but it is and all
this show butchered halo so much that it can not be called an adaptation.
wtf are those  jurnalists  speaking about  thatshit is bad even if we absolutely dont know the origins the story the characters from the game. is a fuckin nonsense from the start to end.
I agree  but... I think the butcher job on wheel of time is at least as bad. just like halo  they had great source material and said  nope  who needs the loyal fans to like this.
I just dont understand how they keep funding this garbage
at this point  I just hate watching the series. and Im not even a huge halo fan. face reveal has just killed any interest for me.
yeah well  game movies have always been bad.
I stopped watching when you saw his  master cheeks  it was to funny and stupid.
sorry but the crown still belongs to the super mario bros. movie. halo is bad like historically  bad  but to be the worst ever there has to be no redeeming qualities whatsoever. some of the battles were fun  not contrived finale   and the covenant  and spartans look  not act  like they should. aside from casting bob hoskins as mario  they got everything wrong.
I like the curly natural hair personally. itsuits youreal well.
this article isn t a review. its a lame attempt to advertise this show to the types of people its meant to manipulate  cough   Imean  to placate to  cough   Imean  is meant to  entertain .  entertain   reinforce the delusion that anyone enjoys or values this flavor of garbage .
I love the games  but I couldn t get past the third episode of this knock off. barf!!!
dragonball evolution was worse.
anything halo after 343 aquired the series is horrible and non-canon in my book
here s something that will make you cringe I can almost see you shaking your head but this days of a quality how about making lara croft a male. traditional male roles in movies now been taken over by woman why not traditional woman rules be taken over by males cringe.
the show is trash it is not halo. from games to books it only have the name.. thats it
