henry is the classic  men wanna be him  women wanna be with him  kind of movie star. he appeals to a very wide audience. its the vocal minority that has an axe to grind with him.
simple  he s a real man who treats the fans and ips with which he works with seriousness and respect.
henry is a class act and actually knows source material unlike the rest of the woke elite in hollywood who dont care for these characters or the fans at all...
I was really sad to hear he wouldn t be returning as superman. he played it perfectly
henry is what hollywood needs to connect with fans to show love not hate
henry is a really good person. we need more people in hollywood like him!
I love henry. he  alongside ryan reynolds  is one of the few hollywood stars I genuinely like on a personal level. they are just good people. I really hope his 40k adventure  the highlander remake  and his new spy series go well for him.
they hate him for being wholesome. cavill cares so much more about the projects he works on than anyone else involved  itseems  too. I saw a tweet about how gunn didn t want the actors in peacemaker to read the comics.
henry cavil is a nerd - in a good way not in the way people in hollywood use it. he is the nerd in the way fans of warhammer  fans of star trek and so on  are. he delves into the detail  the minutia of the things he loves because of how well they are made  and the passion put behind the work. he s basically the same as fans who acted in the new star trek shows and got fired for pointing ou lt discrepancies. of course  he is big up there  so harder to fire cavil. but  hollywood is full of the same kind of people that would bully nerds at school for liking things and being passionate about those things.wb  this is not a good way to go. henry has the fans  backs and is very much one of us  just a guy who is himself and likes the stuff he likes. by sidelining him  you sideline all of us. so... no cavil  no ticket sales.
henry seems to have integrity   most people like him. he s like keanu in that way. Im going to miss him as superman. only had one movie. he got a raw deal for sure.
henry is a good looking straight  strong white man who genuinely seems like a good person. on top of that he has a nerd heart that cares about established fan bases. of course woke hollywood would hate him. you and the article are spot on.
the reason hollywood hates him is because he tries his best to honor the source material  he doesnt compromise.
cavill s post letting fans know he wouldn t be returning to the role  two freaking months after the studio told him to go ahead and announce it  was grace personified. he is old hollywood masculinity and class down to his shoes and these clowns dont deserve to profit off him. watch  the next thing he stars in will absolutely demolish the box office. he is a perfect example of what moviegoers actually want to see.
henry cavill didn t deserve the shit that was given to him by wb. the only reason why I went to the theater to support black adam  was because of his cameo in the film. dude is a terrific actor who actually cares about the fans.
henry cavill is precious. I love him in witcher and I love him as superman. dude is iconic and they will regret
henry cavill is a fan of much the stuff he plays  so he s knowledgeable on the subject matter  and he doesnt push the message   thats why he was let go. fortunately  when God closes a door  the God emperor opens a window.
henry is based  and if he ever gets bored of acting  I have no doubt he would be an absolute beast and extremely successful with pretty much any type of content creation. a nerd after our own hearts.
great points. also appreciate you having a little comment on gunn  which everyone should be when his name comes up. its troubling that the public will be  rightly  outraged at him years ago when the media tells them to  but as soon as the media says he s ok  same person  no change   suddenly the public doesnt care anymore and accepts him.
it makes sense that gunn wouldn t want him  in an interview john cena said that gunn told him not to read any comics or do research for peacemaker.  the last thing gunn would want is someone who knows their nerd stuff  he wants to be in control.  cavill knew the superman he wanted to be and he was going to play it  but gunn wants his version of superman and thats why he is writing it and why he didn t want cavill.
sister you hit 10 nails with one hammer with a single stroke. the best superman to date. the little things he did to add like after he got hit by the locomotive pushed it and spoke to the sgt. before the event of flying his facial expression right before he took to flight  gave me goose bumps that was awesome.  a great expression to add to display before transitioning into flight. henry took superman to another level.
unfortunately the vocal minority that hate him include the people who make casting decisions.
@harbl99  yeah because of the previous comment. his comments when one of those journalist tried to trap him with  toxic fans  question has earned my respect.
@harbl99  exactly
@harbl99  yeah the  oral minority
meh..
the people who made him leave are unfortunately the people who hate him because they cant be like him and cant be with him.
make you wonder if he read the script for man of steel then
or season 2 of witcher.  or batman v superman.
you mean the way the  woke  should conduct themselves
@strider  that is why you dont see him in witcher season 3.
@creed  he probably learned after that. its been almost 10 years  I think.
he s not a man because he is not brave
@soumitro hore  why  he had the guts to speak out on  woke  hollywood. hey. just wondering  how are the sales doing on  woke  boy  oh Imean super boy with his pink haired boyfriend. thats what people want to see. not henry caville  whom audiences dont deserve  but dceu loyalists  ya know real fans  do.
@soumitro hore  is this a batman v superman reference
the ladies love him and he s a man s man.
henry cavill is the classic  cant act  kinda of movie star.
@dragon ball fans cant read  I d say brie larson is the classic cant act star. she basically cant act in any of their movies  its like she only has one emotion and one facial expression. kirsten stewart is also a prime example of that.
@pandaman  we re talking about cavill here.
@dragon ball fans cant read  so  that means we cant make comparisons  especially when evaluating him  you are not used to proper discussions are you  its not  people cant say what I dont want to hear . you started the talk about people who cant act and I simply gave examples. if you dont like it then dont talk about it.
@pandaman  the talk here is melonie mac and her rw followers thatshe s farmed from grifting  complaining about a character not staying and not because they think he s some God tier actor but for irrelevant reasons.whether brie larson can act or not is irrelevant because I dont watch marvel and I sure as hell dont give a crap about the mcu.as for kristen stewart  her awkward facial expressions are still more memorable than henry cavill s acting.
@dragon ball fans cant read  its not about her talk but your talk. I dont care of you are offended  we have freedom of speech and opinion  at least in my country  wether you like it or not. again  if you cant handle the responses then dont comment. kirsten stewart doesnt have memorable facial expressions  she doesnt have any at all. and its nice that you dont care about brie larson  I think we should only talk about what we care about and not induldge in redundant conversations. which makes me wonder why you want to talk about cavill. maybe because you care too much. too much about his success and popularity. its just jealousy. thats also why you cant go in depth with your critique. because its not about how good he is as an actor but about you being offended. you just want to hate him to hate him. line a typical snowflake.
absolutely true. im a great fan  my wife is a great fan. im a retired police officer  athelete  martial arts  video gamer etc and my wife is a school teacher with opposite interests. we both love witcher. enola holmes etc...hes a great actor who appeals to everyone  and a great talent who takes his roles seriously. such a shame  hollywood is clueless  but we know why
jews
hasn t hollywood always bastardized source material  super mario bros. from the 90 s anyone
@kyle denson  with a lot of things  but not everything. mk 95 was great for example if we re talking video game. some have done a better job now than in the past  but in general with comics  games etc hollywood butchers the source material and or wokenizes it now day to fit an agenda most of the time  there are a few exceptions but those are very few.
@kyle denson  we dont speak about that movie!
@kyle denson  I was born in 98  I was spared the horror
and just plain suck.
@nick  if youre referring to hollywood yes they plain suck now days.
@mkf30  I was. I used to love hollywood and cinema  in general. they are such a disappointment now. they really should be ashamed of themselves.
@mkf30  facts.
@nick  thanks you
he got replaced by wil wheaton  really
well... he did the best he could with what they gave him.
its no loss that he s no longer has the superman. the only people thatsee it as a loss are those who want to see him get pigeonholed or typecasted and doubt this what he wants in the long-term. having personally know people who are actors I cantell you no actor wants to be a  one-type  actor because of the negative effect it has on their careers.thatsaid think cavill should be playing superman all his career then you are in no supportive of his acting career but rather the superman character alone. this is I completely agree with tarantino s latest statement... people dont really care about the actor or his career but rather the character they play.
@gloria thomas  good for him probably. as long as they dont cancel his acting career but bad for franchise and the culture with which superman and other heroes are based off.
they hired the  best person for the role  again
one youtuber pointed out that the reason henry is not coming back at superman because of the reception of man of steel wasn t that good
@tanuguitar1  why would his act career gets cancelled  he s an in-demand actor and has many big projects coming. overall cavill is one of those actors who is surviving in an industry where many careers dont last long.
@tanuguitar1  what  will wheaton  it would be funny if it was real
@gloria thomas  if we cared only for the character we d not mind who wears the cape
gal too  even if ww84 was garbage.
serious question  what did all of you alt right boys used when   woke   wasn t a buzzword  did you just sit there looking at the wall or something
@nega narwhal xxx  I saw it in the theater. biggest waste of time and money until the south park movie came out.
@phishcatt  things didn t start getting toxic  extreme and out-of-  hand  til around 2016. so thats a non-issue. also  I was always more center left before until intolerant sjw woke culture became a thing. woke created the anti-woke out of necessity due to their bullying and intolerance.
he was such a class act that noooo one went to support him in black adam which is the reason he is not going to be in future movies.
@mr stark  incorrect and this makes no sense. a lot went to supported him what are you talking about  lol the film itself was also fine  just because it didn t meet a dumb box office quotta means nothing regarding the quality of the film itself...by this logic nobody supported chad either since wakanda forever also bombed at the box office...that has nothing to do with people not supporting henry  lots supported him so not sure what youre talking about lol did you not see majority happy he was coming back . only the woke idiots blame henry for all of this  he did nothing wrong. wb and gunn however are the ones in the wrong here  they had the perfect superman and someone actually knowledgable  passionate about the character and they threw it away because Godforbid an actor actually knows his shit and cares about what the fans want with him being one himself...if anything people had issues with the rock for trying to control the situation that only got out of control because of the old wb regime acting stupid  then telling cavill  yeah youre back make it official  only for gunn to get rid of him....this is all on wb s head acting like a bunch of morons. gunn cantake his time at least since mcu has their own problems since phase 4 sucked  so its not like there s any rush. also  henry already has projects lined up and will yes indeed be in future movies and series so not sure where youre getting your info from but youre mistaken  if anything this will increase his popularity. he doesnt need superman or witcher to be successful  he s already got it all money  looks  fame etc we re not talking about rdj here who s got nothing without ironman...
I agree  though I d throw chris pratt in there too.
and the guy that played thor. I think his a a decent fellow.
dont forget keanu reeves.
good call on ryan reynolds too  completely agree.
thats because he wanted to completely change the characters to tell the same damn far-left narrative that is created ad nauseam.
@rambleon07 honestly I dont think he does woke changes all that much. he just always wants to do his own thing from what we cantell.
@ab- gail  the peacemaker show was pretty damn woke.
what in the world are you talking about  do you personally know cavill to know what sort of person  he is or values he has
@rambleon07  lol no it wasn t
no  he had three full movies and a cameo in a fourth.
@megaspideyman  he was in other movies. he only had one superman movie.
@megaspideyman  he didn t have three full movies. he had one full movie  one shared movie  one participation movie and a cameo.
ok james
you are spot on with this statement
I feel the same way and watched black adam to see henry cavill. they should have done a mos 2 and let henry fly off into the sunset.
I went to see black adam just day before yesterday  and the movie as a whole was fun  though the story definitely was half-baked. seeing henry during the mid credits was inspiring  but now there s no reason for me to see any future dc movies.
neither witcher or superman deserve him. the witcher is now dead
@thebosswolf5680  all of a sudden I value season 1 of the witcher that much more and I already loved it.
@chad wendt  me too. it was great  season 2 was ok at best  but you could see where it was going. I ll always love season 1 tho. I totally agree with ya on that!
@the boss wolf
the dude can actually act too. watch him in the goodbye mr chips remake. breaks your heart in 2 minutes flat.
@harbl99  I actually never seen that  but I ll take your word on it. dude is great
I agree  there is a control issue and henry has too much knowledge of games and comics and also he likes to take control and is a perfectionist   not good for gunn.
funny how that  cavill know his stuff  about comics never came up when zack snyder was turning superman into a brooding  emo sociopath with no emotions
but peacemaker still was a success
I ll laugh my ass off when his little projects fail miserably and no one goes to see them.
if I ever win the lottery big prize  I would fund mos2 episode 1   2 and bring in supergirl and have kick alots of butts.
youre freaking right they dont. henry cavill has more class than anybody in hollywood put together more class more grace more dignity and one finger than anybody does in their entire bodies. I actually felt a little bitsorry for james gun when he was   canceled  but now Im hoping it happens again he really screwed us over by not having henry cavill as the man of steel
Im super stoked henry cavill will be in and produce a warhammer 40k series over at amazon. although I do not trust amazon  I trust henry. if he ends up walking away from the 40k series then we know why. if anyone could do warhammer 40k  its henry cavill.
could it be a possibility because henry cavill is connected to dwayne the rock johnson because they both have his wife or his former wife as their agents could that be a possibility or could it be a possibility because black adam didn t do so well in theaters  just asking the question. I think henry cavill should be playing superman no matter what because you dont want a coming of age story again
henry cavill is loved liked by so many  because despite the fact he s an absolute specimen  he s one of us! he s a regular nice bloke who shares many of the same hobbies as people out there that are considered  geeks .
they bad thing about this... he s a man of integrity.
hollywood has traditionally been a large driver of pop culture and they know it. those currently at the wheel have made it clear at this point that none of this is done in ignorance  and that they will not deviate from pushing their message for love or money.  so all we can do is boycott their products  both to hold to our own values and starve them of our dollars in the hopes that they change.
they hate him for sure  but Im really glad to see the announcement about warhammer 40k. we definitely deserve him even though the majority of hollywood does not.
I had a glimmer of hope when I heard the story of when henry showed up to  I believe his kid s  schoolplus he did alright as supermanI noticed lately that the less time celebs spend in the spotlight the more based and nice they turn out to be
Ive never felt so bad for an actor. he seems like a good dude who really loved the character. he s been put through the ringer since landing the role.
nature is healing.  that was the same thing I was thinking in that things were starting to turn around in hollywood decision-making. loved mr. cavill s portrayal of superman and was bummed to hear the bad news  too.
I wouldn t worry too much about cavill. he s got a terrific warhammer series in the works and it could be the best thing he ll do.
henry cavill is a rare breed of actors that have a passion for the source material  and wants to bring it out to the fullest in the screen. I can understand taking certain liberties with the story to fit it into a movie or tv show due to time limits in both mediums  like Lord of the rings for example  but outright changing lore and established character traits  I will call it closer to fanfic writing.that being said  I used to have some hope for the future mass effect 4 to be good  but seeing how they need to fulfil the diversity  inclusion  equity  d.i.e  policy  I have very little hope for the story and the ip to be good anymore  even if they have the brand name bioware.
james gunn is so egotistical with his God complex. he was writing this script for awhile  was planning on removing henry  and he actually doesnt like him. gunn asked matt reeves if he could use his batman for his new universe  and have the batman be the first project to be canon in it. however matt said no. also  gunn lashed out at den of nerds in a pretty unprofessional way on twitter when he said he didn t like henry. he s going to partially reboot what he wants  and keep his wife  peacemaker  and ss characters  what a selfish self-centered immature prick imo.
henry cavill being executive producer of the wh40k thing  is the first thing in years Ive felt excited about.  even if it is amazon prime.
no henry cavill   my wallet is now shut.
Im glad you mentioned chris pratt. he was whom I thought of when I heard the news about henry cavill. they re both class acts. they re both slowly being cancelled because they dont follow the hollywood narrative  yet keep their personal politics out of their public lives. may henry find something better outside of hollywood.
men like him  as well as ryan reynolds  mark hamill  keanu reeves  chris hemsworth  bob odenkirk  and denzel washington is what hollywood needs more of. leading men with a passion for their craft  knowledge and experience as well as respect for the source material.
he s got so many more projects he s working on that he ll still be busy and very successful for a long time to come. while he may be frowned upon by some  even his detractors melt in his presence  so this is but a blip on the map of what is still to become of mr. cavill s story.thatsaid  I haven t  felt  emotional over hollywood movie news in a long  long time.  the last time being when my brother screwed up and my dad refused to take us to see return of the jedI in the theater back in the early 80s  so we didn t actually know if vader was really luke s father for like seven years when it finally came out on vhs  lol . anyway  I felt a legitimate tinge of sadness when I heard this news thatstill comes back if I think on it. he s a real gem in this world and this is such a waste of perfection  that itshould be illegal. kind  decent  humble  just to put a few adjectives out there  is also what sells bigly  but filthy hollywood still refuses to accept that fact.my guess  also  is that had black adam really done well and even kept up with black panther  gunn might have gone that route. but with it more or less only getting mediocre results  he s probably scared and thinking that universe is dead. yet its not  but was just plagued with bad  bad writers. casting has not been the problem  save for ezra miller  yet casting  the best part of all of this  is the first effing thing they kill. ugh!
henry cavill is literally the mild mannered clark kent and will always be superman to me. hes sweet and thoughtful and kind. he will be missed
how is cavill not the next james bond
is it warhammer or warhammer 40k
@truirrashunovadepressure 40k
at least with amazon  all of their properties aren t tainted with woke bs.  you just need to find out who is producing  writing  directing etc.
afraid black adam was recutby the new ddirection to be a fun family movie and maybe it could have been darker but gunn already pulled the strings to make it flop
@nj  we live in a society where you cant say or do anything anymore you cant voice your opinion about anything you cant do anything Imean Im not talking about extremes like kanye west  or anything but you cant say or do anything anymore everything has to be politically correct otherwise people dont agree agree or they get on their high horse and they voice their opinions on certain people
we also live in a society which worships at the altar of youth.  an older superman  or for that matter  batman    nah - it has to be  relatable  for those in their teens  twenties and early thirties.  stuff for oldies or that tackles the perspective of superheroes as they get older  watchmen  for instance  doesnt generate the same bucks.
@abnon-tha  superman rarely ages and when he does it isn t much. superman has never been much older looking than his 30s.
@abnon-tha  also dark knight returns is one of the most popular batman stories and he s in his 50s there. batman beyond has bruce in his 60s. and most mainstream batman stories and games such as the arkham ones put him in his 40s a good portion of the time. or at least he should be. and to be fair for movies its pretty old to find a 40 to 60 year old who can do all the stunts batman can.
actually they get money because there are certain investor funds that reward them for woke points.
yeah he showed up to his nephew s school because they didn t believe him when he said his uncle was superman. cant get more superman than that
if je is so good why does most of hollywood hate the guy  he doesnt really sound like the good guy at all.
wow  is it gonna be on netflix
@b n  amazon.
@galadrius the mighty  ugh thanks
im glad he didnt let gunn get access to the batman  he needs to stay away from that
I d remove a few guys from the list but youre mostly spot on
life goes on folks. its not like the world is coming to an end because cavill isn t playing superman.
@gloria thomas  you must be really fun at parties.
probably more fun then you would be lol
although according to overLord dvd  henry s career was on the chopping block for a handful of reasons from  black adam  bombing to problems with  wonder woman 3  and flash s actor.in fact  doomcock said he didn t do a video on henry s cameo in  black adam  because his sources told him his return seemed unlikely.
another possible problem for them could just be writer s laziness. its easy to write a movie where the main character is young and inexperienced  then you can have them make easy mistakes. but an older  wiser character at the top of their game  they re not easy to trick. suddenly the challenges have to be written competently as well  and thats too hard to be bothered about  apparently
for me his most surprising movie were the two enola homes movies. I think he is the reason that what was meant to be a super girl power movie was actually fairly balanced. I think he stopped his sherlock character from being the joke of the movie.
I just got into the warhammer 40k universe earlier this year upon reading the eisenhorn trilogy. Im hooked. I think cavill would make a great eisenhorn or someone similar.on another note  Im currently playing a pc game called warhammer 40 000  darktide and I cant get enough. I think henry cavill s presence will only increase this universe s popularity.
that was such a lost opportunity. thanks a lot  james. thanks. I hope he turns them down if they ever approach him to be superman again in the future. as bad as this was  I hope he refuses to ever be superman again. on to bigger and better things for him and I wish him the best.
henry cavill was a natural pick for the role of superman due to the fact that he has the same principles and values thatsuperman was given when he was created.
whilst itsucks that he will no longer be superman  although he will remain as superman to all of us  Im delighted to hear that he will starring in a new warhammer 40k production! especially since he will also be an executive producer  meaning he ll have a lot of say in how itshould turn out!
he is the perfect role model everything a man should be a class act
hey I see some of my comments. so cool. by enough about me.   firejamesgunn henry is like the king nerd. I love that he wants products to reflect the source material. henry is gong to sore to new heights and bust through barriers. he will absolutely slay warhammer as long as the prodution company doesnt hold him back.  henrycavill great video melonie. I hope youre doing well. take care
when the world turned to make a sunrise 12 14 2022  I had great hope for dc.by the time the sun had set the following day I had none.
let us show more love for this wonderful man.
henry cavil is loyal a fan of source material and will not take shit from creepy executives he has my respect
Im gonna miss what could have been with him
I hope henry cavill get s amazing roles in the future and not only that but I hope he becomes a producer of his own works eventually and adapts video game movies.
very disappointed that henry cavill is out as superman. he was awesome as superman and in the witcher series. I am so happy he is bringing warhammer to live action. I wish him all the success that he has earned and he is the most humble  classy actor and human being hollywood has left. class act all the way.  henrycavill.
I really enjoyed henry cavill s superman.  man of steel only got a 53  ish on rotten tomatoes  but I will say its a solid 86  and watched itseveral times.  I enjoyed the humanity cavill brought to the character and the mental struggles he dealt with.
unless its a female character  in which case they re the bestest ever right out the starting gate--this is why we get all the origin stories involving male characters  to make them look bad. henry is pretty awesome and he s legit one of us.  Imean  really  the man builds computers  builds and paints miniatures and actually plays warhammer as opposed to simply being vocal about it. he is one of us. kudos to henry for keeping it classy always!
they hate him mostly for being on the side of fandom  putting fans first has not been hollywood s priority in a long while and anyone that doesnt push the  message  above all is shunned and sidelined.
he needs to become the next james bond. just look at him and look at connery and tell me that he wouldn t look just like bond. also we need jon hamm to play superman now.
I would love to see henry do an injustice superman   I think he d be great showing emotion losing lois lane and his unborn child  and anger killing joker. and a good fight with batman in a mech suit and kryptonite. I cant wait to see him in warhammer. if they let him direct and produce it as well. I feel like if this doesnt go well he s going to quit acting
humble  didn t he once brag about how much money he has  thats not humble
if james gunn knew what he was doing  he would understand that the last thing the character needs is another story told about his younger life. period
gonna say something similar to what I said about disney s pinocchio remake  hollywood is way too comfortable with immortality to understand this character and story
absolutely no chance of me seeing any superman without henry
hollywood does not hate henry. those situations were decided by a small group of other people at the studios.  Im super bummed about superman cuz he was absolutely perfect for that role but  I think this is a one door closes and another opens for my dude cavill. I know he s gonna be in some spy movie from.the guy who did kingsman which could be epic and then I hope he does a gangster ass version of warhammer for amazon
also heard a rumor he might take over bond. which would be neat simply because he really does seem like the old school debonair manly man like you were saying. warhammer would be sick though!
Im sooooo excited for his warhammer role. I knew something was going on when there was no announcements with witcher and superman. they werent taking his advice with witcher so when the contract was up he bounced because he had this in the works and hes going to executive produce so we should hopefully see an accurate on screen universe with none of the crap we see now of days just to appease non fans.
while people are sooo sad for cavill he is enjoying life and working on other projects. hope all this crap said against the franchise does not harm cavill  s career.
henry cavill. keanu reeves and tom cruise are rare examples of real movie stars who actually care about the fans these days.
idk what warhammer is but Im excited about that for henry   dc as a whole has been soo damn messy so overall I wanna see what james has planned but he could have kept henry for at least 3 more films then do some time travel thing to make it make sense in whatever 10 year plan he has
warner b had been through a lot trying to turn a profit  but its so funny that they cannot see the diamonds they have in their hands but are scrambling to dig out an elusive treasure that is still a twinkle in their minds eyes. to not make a blockbuster with a henry cavill  superman in his prime while reaching for a new and young superman
loved the video. ya you hit the right points about cavill. he s a fan of a lot of good material. no one should ever apologize for being a masculine man lol. or for there race. crazy hollywood.
everyone already knows super mans younger years origan stories.  the fans want him fighting the best of his villains! we finally got something like that in the zach snyder movies.  we have never had any of the conflicts that actually made the fans love superman.
check out doomcocks video on this. henry was cut as a budget issue warner is loosing its shirt and doesnt have the backing of theme parks or a massive online shopping mall to help it get by. they cant afford to sustain these losses and are trying to be profitable.cavil is a class act as he has shown with his departure from witcher and superman.
I also have a theory why henry cavill wont be superman. he wants true story to make fans happy when they watch movies he is in
I think its unfortunate that he wont get another shot at superman  but that doesnt necessarily mean they re going to go woke with superman. I withhold judgement until I see what they actually end up doing because a lot is getting gutted at warner s and its hard to know exactly what is happening when there is dust and debris in the air.I do wish we could have cavil as superman at least one more time. but I am very curious about what happens when the ip moving forward.now when do we all stop complaining about hollywood  pitch our resources together and start making our own films and beat them at their own game  because that is what needs to happen
it feels like hollywood likes to keep their characters stuck in  beginner mode .
he s just a wholesome dude! .    nuff said!
he looks like superman and has the same personality and values superman would have in real life.
he s 39  there are laws thatsay you cant discriminate people over 40 depending on your state. the movie would most likely be finished after he s 40  Im sure most of the filming would be in california and he might be able to sue them for age discrimination.
I just have a respect for this guy that is unmesurable.
man of steel was an origin story and he fought zod a character he s encountered many times and let alone was the main villain of superman 2 with Christopher reeves.
henry really is superman irl rn lol
henry cavill is everything hollyweird hates.  he s an excellent actor.  obviously hollyweird doesnt like want those.cavill is a class act.  he deserves far better than what hollyweird offers.  he ll get better roles  even if they aren t the roles he always wanted because jackwagons ruined those for him.  if he retires its what they deserve and he s earned the retirement.  I ll rewatch geralt-centric episodes of witcher season one  the snide s.o.b. inside my head wants to add  both of them   because he was brilliant as geralt.  but he s a skilled professional in a world of lame checkboxer adult pretenders.  if he flies off into the sunset now  that ll be a shame for the fans.  but I wouldn t blame him.  having the idiotic people overseeing your passion projects take a steaming dump on your dream roles is never a good time.
superman has never been my favorite comic book character. however Im a big fan of henry cavill and he was a perfect superman! he is a big fan in any project that he s in and he knows the lore of it. he is a class act. also we all know that melonie loves henry cavill!  haha
dear melonie          I have been having a fangasm every since I heard henry cavill would be helming a  warhammer 40k project. Im going to date myself here. but I have been down for this since   rogue trader     about 35 terran years . I hope you dont have to wait that long for a good  tomb raider   project          and we shall know no fear !!! thats one of the battle cries of the ultra marines.  I think all of us nerds should adopt that as our own. love your show.     p.s. cool sleeve tattoo
hollywood does not deserve henry cavill - he is too good for them.
they could use de-aging and the stuff they did for chris evans in captain america  but they wont.  zsaslav has ordered gunn to reboot the entire dceu  meaning new  cheaper  actors for all roles in the future.
cavill is just wholesome
brilliant title  he truly is too good for hollywood.
and I was looking forward to seeing what a proper superman with henry cavill would look like. oh well. cavill is a gentleman and a class act  so indeed hollywood doesnt deserve such a great human being.
henry is the retro hollywood star that has no place in woke hollywood
my hope is that its all just about keeping info under wraps and rein it in... do a legion of superheroes superman story with a younger supes.  that would still potentially need a older superman where they bring in cavill as a surprise.  but Im an optimist.
considering he is now doing the live action of warhammer 40k I am confident enough that it would be good.
I want to cry because I thought dc had it in the bag. but noooooooooooooooooooooo
the good news  henry is absolutely one of us. the bad news  the proof came thru hollywood s treatment of him. had to outside  amazon  to find a good situation...I believe. ultimately we ll see  but nice to see he has soem say on both sides of the camera. no more snarky writer s room....never again!
he s a different age.......the age of quality leading men with character and charisma who you aspire to be........this is an entirely different type of age
this is the best take Ive seen. exactly correct. henry is the best!
I love henry cavil as superman!!!
so funny hollywood just wants to use him to be eye candy  but he s just too good of an actor to only be eye candy
henry not being superman is good imo. now he will get to devote all his energy and time to warhammer which is something I guarantee you he would prefer.
damn  I was looking forward to seeing him back in the role  especially after seeing black adam. also  hollywood always messes up by changing directors. like  where s zach snyder   I hate when they switch directors. they did it with the star trek movies too  how could you switch from jj abrams  I dont get it. like they say  if it ain t broke dont try to fix it.
I think the main problem is what superman stands for henry cavil has the same qualities  but they dont want that. just listen to his statement was just enough to make you believe that there is a reel super main.
henry caville seems like a genuine dude
warner bros. disrespected henry cavill  and the fans. henry cavill a classy and humble. he is superman.
they just fired him because he didn t want to go with wokeism  their loss our win!just for showing thatspine integrity and giving hollywood the middle finger I ll support every project he is in
a horus heresy movie with cavil would melt my brain   wallet.
we need to start a go fund me for movies and shows we actually want to see
I am so pleased that he announced that project
smallville 10 seasons  no more young superman
all I can say about henry making a 40k series is  for the emperor!!!
well said we want to see superman!not another young starting out superhero
when james gunn says someone is  the wrong age   he means they re over 18.
unfortunately guys the ship for any hope for his return has sailed . he s moved on and its for the best
if what he is saying is true and they arent doing another origin story then my guess is they are doing a super sons story maybe I do recall them showing a pregnancy test in justice league movie in one of the lois scenes
Im happy henry cavill will be part of a wh project. its better for him to be in that than in any james gunn lead project.
henry cavill must have refused to sell his soul
he should make his own podcast.
insanity! to not let the guy that embodies everything superman stands for  play superman! it is simply gunns ego he doesnt want someone else overshadow him and steal his limelight!
james gunn isn t the woke type though  I never seen a film of his with that type of messaging. I think he means what he says and I say wait for his dcu to come out first before Imake a judgment. zack snyder s dcu will forever be my favorite  but at least I have a more then wonderful trilogy to come back too
no matter what they ll do  henry cavill will always be our superman!
blood for the blood God  and henery cavill for the main role!
wb is now too entrenched into  wokeness  to do the right thing and let henry cavill play the superman character
I could not agree more with you about this
I d lose my shit if cavill went to marvel and played miracleman or kid miracleman. henry deserves so much better.
I personally cant wait for superman in his teens because we ve definitely never seen that before.
wherever he goes  I will follow.
imagine firing hugh jackman as wolverine.  the fans would rebel and leave. same here.
sadly  itseems like a coordinated effort to ruin his career. he s a great guy  a fantastic actor  and he personified the characters he portrayed. geralt of rivia  kal-el  even sherlock holmes.we dont deserve such a talent  yet God saw fit to give us one  and hollywood is simply tossing him aside.
hollywood is like that dnd table where the campaign never gets past the third session without the dm deciding to start a new campaign.
I love how much you love lara croft! I hardly see anyone who is as big a tomb raider fan on youtube! she s been my favorite video game character for over 20 years!
liam hemsworth is the new superman.
was kinda new to your channel and after watching your video the other day regarding religion I straight away joined the discord even tho didn t know what I was doing but just knew it was right . God bless you lady
when I saw james gunn wearing a rainbow shirt with teeth I wasn t surprised he didn t want the man of steel.
you just earned yourself a new subscriber! I have 2 words for warner bros and james gunn  screw you!! there is no reason to recast any of the dc superheroes. henry cavill is great as superman and gal gadot was brilliant casting as wonder woman. I dont care for affleck as batman  or an actor really  so he can be replaced  momoa is fine as aquaman and ezra will be replaced anyway as the flash so I dont care.this is disgusting that gunn wont fix the snyderverse and just reuse the same cast cause he wants to a hard reboot instead. just use the flash movie to do a soft reboot. so to show gunn and warner bros I ll not support their new dc universe I ll buy both wonder woman movies on blu ray and black adam when it comes out!!
im waiting for a superman vs brainiac live action in my lifetime odds of that are slim but it would wreck!
he s so underused for what he could do. good as superman and geralt  and man from uncle was good too.
I loved smallville so an early life of superman is great  but they could have done that later  cavill is one of the most clear cut actors for the role so its a mistake. I assume its because dc are having money issues and need cheap actors with a hit to get back on their feet.
dc studio also hates their fans  calls them toxic and treats its talent behind and front of the camera like dirt and it never changes...henry cavill  patty jenkins  everybody that worked on batgirl  zack synder and his wife when they just lost their daughter  ray fisher etc. they also have not fired ezra miller or amber heard yet..they just dont care unlike marvel  its tough being a dc fan..
henry cavill needs to play commander shepard in a mass effect series and be the producer also.
james gunn s ego is getting in the way he doesnt want anyone around to challenge his view. its no secret they dont want anyone working on a project that knows anything about the source material. not saying mr. cavill is perfect  but the world could use more people like him.
this is where we at . yes  I know. I heard it 20 000 times  you dont need to remind me
apparently he will be going for a warhammer role with amazon prime another fav game of his...awesome stuff
without him  how will we get our neck snapping quota for the future of dc
think he ruined his own career by not returning to the witcher
@nathan schroeder  that was probably the best move he could have made. he chose superman  over a failing witcher.
@nathan schroeder  season 1 was great. season 2 was hot garbage. Ive never seen a show fall so far  so fast. season 2 was so bad  that Im probably not even going to watch anything past the first episode of season 3. and Im only watching the first episode of season 3 in the hopes that it ll be as good as season 1. but I doubt it.
@noneya bidness  lol he chose superman and got neither and pissed off netflix and lost 50m lol.  pretty bad career move.
@nathan schroeder  still a good career move  because now he has warhammer. for  of and by the fans.
@noneya bidness  lol no it really wasn t.  his days on blockbuster films are over and warhammer sounds boring
@nathan schroeder  he did. and it ll make more than a dc film  or season 4 of witcher will make  easily.   amazon spent a billion on a failed lotr rip off  that never had a chance. imagine how much they re willing to spend on a fantasy franchise that will have talented actors and writers at the helm. just sayin .
@nathan schroeder  time will prove one of us right. you shouldn t assume that will be you.
@noneya bidness  I know it will be shit because its not something Im interested in. whether it meets expectations for those interested is tbd tho you are correct.  no video fame or board game to movie is any good why would this one be any different.
@nathan schroeder  lots of successful crossovers. also lots of failures. it ll be different because the failures always try to change the core of the franchise for  broader audience appeal.  with fans at the helm  that  hopefully.  fingers crossed   wont happen. I believe the key to success with such lore rich and beloved  ips  is to keep them faithful.like marvel used to do  before their shows started sucking.
@nathan schroeder  perhaps you wont like it. perhaps many wont. I know nothing about it  but I know passion produces quality. and thats what cavill brings.
@noneya bidness  I have no personal issue with cavill btw.  Im more ignored we will probably see a new wonderwoman as well.  Imean its not these actors fault the movies are shit  ww 2   3 .  I guess you may as well blow the whole thing up tho.  jason momoa like him or not is very popular especially with woman.  I dont see how you can fire them all.
hey melanie  question about channels like screen crush and emergency awesome  their breakdowns are so intricate and always so pro marvel disney  no matter how crappy  and always slightly antI dc  im wondering if these people are paid pr mouthpieces given scripts by the studios  your breakdown feel authentic to me. do you know anything about channels like this working for studios
he would make a great james bond.
ah thanks for this video  was watching grace randolph from beyond the trailer talking about him and man oh man did she talk trash about him...oooof  but you hit the bullseye  he is what woke hollywood hates...
new video! lets go!!!!. hey melonie. hope youre well
good content and I agree 100
after watching man of steel 2013  when I see henry cavil  I see him as superman. its complete foolishness not have him carry on the mantle. to if their goal is to not make money from us consumers and avid fans  they have successfully succeeded. clown world strikes again.
forget superman he is producing a 40k series on his own now! I am more stoked about him being in charge of a project because he can make it the way the damn source material shows it!
henry cavill was an amazing superman. its a travesty this is happening.and honestly I dont want another recycled  re-hashed origin story. so many stories they could do  another  young  origin story is so unoriginal and done to death. ughbut man  is henry cavill a class act. never has a actor cared about source material as much as this man. huge amount of respect for everything he wants to give fans. its refreshing that a actor doesnt just take a payday.
this is really speculative honestly. henry cavill was in trouble with the woke mob like 4 years ago  I dont think they re paying much attention to him at the moment  but Im not saying thats not happening to chris pratt or to other people in general.
so annoyed  for years I thought all hope was lost for another solo movie and just when hope was given  back to us it was snatched away by the new regime
Im a big warhammer fan. everyone in the community loves cavil!
I can hear the pain in your voice  and I sympathize.
can you imagine marvel firing robert downy jr as iron man during his peak
I cant help but think that if mr. cavill had the creative control over the witcher series  season 2 might not have been the last season I ll ever watch.
you may just be right about there being something deeper here. Imean we have seen keanu reeves turn down disney roll  for marvel  maybe he turned down superman  because there was something about it that was woke  and he didn t like it.
I bet he got on as a producer to ensure this wasn t another witcher situation.
you know what despite all this Im willing to give james gunn the benefit of the doubt because he s focusing on making a movie then the message I feel like people are too quick to judge and they re too angry at the moment. james gunn has been calm about the situation cant say the same for the fans though who are wanting him to get fired
hollywood  gives cavill the boot as superman  but backs in behind ezra miller as the flash. hmm.
I dont think its about the integrity of henry or any of the other actors. starting over is just something that needs to be done. the actors are getting older and we get movies few and far between from our heroes as a collective and when we do  its a toss up whether or not it ll be good. things should be smoother and far better for the live action dc universe  than it has ever been before... hopefully
henry cavill deserves better
wb will pay the ultimate price for removing henry cavill from the superman role because of their  wokeness
here is the problem if people wanted henry so bad why didn t they go see him at the end of black adam
watched the bee avatar movie. didn t think it was as good as the first one  but its still a good watch. also it isn t woke  so thats awesome.
they hate him for his freedoms. -george bush probably
just a thought here but ytubers dont do henry cavill any favors by posting titles with hate in them.  the last thing an actor needs is to attach that word to their name and reputation.  its only clickbait anyway for yt vids.   lov ya  melody  youre a voice for classic tomb raider and Lord knows we desperately need that!
image cavill with a big beard and in a war hammer armor or in a tux for bond. thatsounds pretty good.
they used his cameo in black adam to boost hype for that film and as soon as he served his purpose  he was discarded.
I want a melonie mac origin story. that would be really interesting to me.
hollywood has an amazing ability of not giving people what they want...completely out of touch.  vote with our     until someone gets a freaking clue.
he s not sweating it because he has a big role in the upcoming warhammer release... ...
peacemaker was right about superman having a  poop fetish
henry cavill is the best superman. no doubt. love henry cavill.
forgive me if this is off topic  but I would ve loved to see henry cavill   chadwick boseman  and ryan reynolds team up on a feature.  who wouldn t want to see the wholesome guys of hollywood kick all kinds of ass on screen
I want to see cavil reteamed with caviezel.
woot! go henry go! for the emperor!
I just found your channel.  lady you are awesome
imagine firing the one guy that everyone wanted back. Imean he s the only reason anyone watches anything from the black adam movie.
Ive said it before  but the only good that will come from this is we ll be getting a new lex luthor finally. snyders version can get up the damn road and take his cherry jolly rancher with them.
7 21 this is the real reason of all of it.
henry is great . although I didn t love his superman  I dont blame him for that  I blame the director. the truth is that the guy is almost 40 and if the dcu wants to reboot and have a long run of success like marvel did with the infinity saga  I can see why they d want to go with someone younger. dc s bigger issue will be trying to replace gal and jason  who are extremely popular for playing those characters.
for all we know  henry cavill might be on the melmac diet
they want miller and heard as clark and louise
Im a woman. not felicia s mother. not kevin s wife.         -thanks very much. we need someone a little older.                    mom! dad! uncle pete  come quick! something s wrong with biscuit! I think he s dead! -we re looking for someone younger. they have dinner--  can I start again  I didn t get kicked off right.                   -the reading was fine. youre the wrong height.                   I can be taller.             -no. we re looking for somebody shorter.           look. I dont have to be this tall. see  Im wearing lifts. I can be shorter.-I know  but we re looking for somebody different.             I can be different           -we re looking for somebody else.
they hate a real man
doomcock says canceling cavill as superman was mostly a zaslav decision rather than gunn s. zaslav doesnt think cavill is worth the price tag and wants cheaper actors. dunno if doing a young version of superman can allow for an older cavill to return later. also feeling bad for gunn taking all the hate if this was a zaslav decision.
yes but now he s on a warhammer project!! whoop!!
you need an intro  melonie. a title card and theme song.
they always do an origin story with mario too
he s too cool for hollywood anyways.
snubbing henry because the vision has changed to a younger superman is not a good enough reason. the vision needs to change  not the actor.
henry cavill is awesome.
Im not as optimistic for amazon s war hammer 40k  its amazon. sure  they may do it justice but rangs of power was their last big release. so  gonna let thatstew a bit.
its about pay. they would have to pay gal cavil  aflack   manoa and everyone else massive cash. new actors not as much cash. also snyder would get a small payment as long as its some iteration of chars from his universe.
I wish she would twitch stream more
he would make a great aegon the conqueror
I want to think that he left superman so he could work on geek stuff like warhammer
hImelonie its friday may you your family have enjoying weekend for everything youdone so far of the remaining ofthis year.aswell things to come in 2023.its been joybeing on your chanel listening to your thoughts  opions.takecare melonie
as for your chris pratt comments  chris pratt is the most successful mcu actor by far. he stars in 2 billion   franchises  has his own streaming show  and is the voice of mario. the man is killing it and I doubt he even has time for any more projects so I dont know why you think he would get more work if it was 20 years ago.
pour one out for superman  friends.
Im iffy on momoa as aquaman. think he ll make a really good lobo if that is what they in fact have planned for him. but cavill was good as superman. shame his movies weren t as good. same goes with afleck. surprisingly he made a decent older batman.would be nice if they did a live action dark knight returns with cavill and afleck.
I am upset that both henry cavill and ben affleck wont return as both superman and batman with better scripts. I am tired of reboots and dc should have just soft rebooted it.
no I dont like intros  I like just getting to the point  p
I have a bad feeling about his amazon 40k gig... sounds like a tom shippey  the tolkien expert fired by the rings of power creative team  situation in the making. 40k has been  problematic  for years  because it  glorifies fascism  xenophobia and toxic masculinity   they re not going to stick to the source material  it burns them like holy water would burn a vampire. cavill will eventually be pushed out by the sjws. heck  even freaking games workshop is woke.
wait  by the God emperor s glory  what did you just say  a warhammer project with cavill in it  the emperor protects!
Im hearing we should have a new movie   melonie mac  tomb raider ...also  we need to introduce henry cavil to gina carano...
love chris pratt in terminal list
melanie  youre on santa s nice list
sorry he wont be returning as superman  but I am super-stoked to be getting a warhammer project.
you cant reboot the dcu if you dont replace all the actors.  new actors will instantly show audiences that this isn t the same old thing.  dc can benefit from a reboot because they haven t been making money.
Ive actually never seen any of his movies  but just looking at him  he s more Christopher reeve than Christopher reeve. didn t he date gina carano too  based.
chris pratt needs to speak up because the majority of the people in america are being overshadowed by a vocal minority
in regards to chris pratt having arnie as your father in law doesnt hurt either
I would not be surprised if they came out with a supergirl movie to go along with their compulsive need to focus on a  strong female lead.  but then they have to ruin her character too the same way they did she-hulk. I dont get why they cant understand that they d be more successful and make more money if they just gave us fans what we want. Ive been waiting patiently for spiderman to mature and really grow into his abilities and all his potential. I have enjoyed each of the lead actors  toby  andrew and now tom  with what they ve brought to the character respectively-- although none have totally matched the comic version but andrew has been the closest. I appreciate the glimpses of maturity we got to see with toby and andrew in no way home. but so help me  if they f-up spiderman with their woke foolishness Im gonna lose it. but then we see that nothing is sacred to hollywood. I would have thought they would appreciate the golden goose they have in henry cavill.  the idiots. superhero and fantasy aside   I d love for henry to show  em all what a great leading man is  uncompromising and unapologetic. hopefully he ll get a great new project soon.
cavill learned a lesson from witcher  and now is executive producer for warhammer 40k  hopefully no more fuckery from the studios and henry can focus on the source material
wb execs are blaming the end of dcu on the flop of black adam. despite the good perfomances of the rock  brosnan and hodges the flick sucks. too similar to marvel. well  dc only works with gritty  dark and epic movies. snyder knows best. he nailed this universe. mos  bvs and jl are wonderful films. a pity that wb didn t trust him letting this visionary director build his opus. I didn t like zack when I was younger  now I love his body of work. thanks zack  ben and henry. good luck and best wishes.
henry s great but wb wasn t gonna bring him back even before gunn. his agent and johnson pressured them into his cameo in black adam.  which sucked by the way . I think doing a young superman or superboy movie is a great idea. it gives them more options for a deeper story. other than just a bunch of over done vfx and fights.
I dont apologize for being a man but because Im not 6 ft tall and ripped the s    Im still called fat and lazy its funny how the world works when youre good looking
it would be awesome if the cast henry as the original superman... doc savage!!!
hey melonie! figured this would be the next video  lol. you look beautiful today. hope you have a wonderful day.
hey good morning melonie I just wanted to tell you thatsorry for this comment being late from yesterday. anyway I just wanted to say that if hollywood hates him so much then why did they want him to stay playing superman in the movies  anyway he is so classic and cool in movies that he needs to stay and keep doing movies that he likes and loves to do and dc movie company needs him and he needs to stay with dc movie company to keep playing his movie role of superman character so that he can get paid for doing his job for the dc movie company  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to make a comment about this video topic and I just wanted to tell you thatsorry for this being late from yesterday and last night. anyway I hope you had a great day and night yesterday and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at home and with your parents today melonie. anyway have a great day melonie.
rumour has it that he s producing a 40k project going forwards. also mel  get into 40k. you d love the sisters of battle. they re religious zealot warrior nuns who hate aliens.
this pissed me off soooooo bad. sorry I said  pissed  melonie.  we lost witcher too so I am speechless - actually well myley cyrus got her ex to play the witcher so we are fucked now. oof  I said  fucked.
sadly  this is all true. gw has been a whole dumpster fire for years. if he stays on and isn t pushed out by the mind virus people  it has a chance to be good  but I fear the worst.
well you know what they say   expect the worse so you cant be disappointed .
I heard that on the jack show last night. they had a hell of an agreement over whether he would have much say so in the project. then they argued over whether it would be woke or not. everyone was yelling and talking at the same time so I never heard if it was even possible. is there anyway that it could be
apparently so. amazon bought the rights to produce from games workshop. games workshop will maintain some creative control  but more importantly  cavill is an executive producer as well.
I feel this was deliberately done to besmirch his name. he was asked to publicly announce his return as superman  only to then not cast him. I am glad he did not rant and rave  but instead leave a classy farewell and look out to do the next thing that he loves. and seriously  did no one think about the age when cavill was asked to make the announcement
is hollywood  going forward  laying the foundation for more success in the future with their present behavior  not exactly. you may start seeing a lot more storytelling in video media not made with those people.
we were ready for superman lewis and his son jonathan
corpos want to take credit for creating the next big cinematic universe. thats probably why they want to keep remaking origin stories. they think they re going to make the next iron man  instead we just get another reimagined-for-a-modern-audience reboot that will be forgotten in a year or less.
I thought man of steel was a young superman he was inexperienced thats why he was destroying the city while fighting zod we already had this
cavill is the best superman who got the worst superhero films for his character. now that cavill is producing his own tv series should be a plus to the geekdom as he is a real fan not a hired jaded mercenary like creatives on the witcher or rings of power.
james gunn didn t say they doing an origin story but earlier time in metropolis.  I believe it will be closer in tone to Christoper reves superman.  I think gunn and zaslav want younger actors so they can put them in a 10 year contract at a lower rate of pay.  for all the whinning and bitching  the henery cavill and  zack snyder fans didn t save most of the dc movies being bombs. I look forward to the new reboot.  I hope they can do it right this time. I have heard also  cavill can be hard to work with.  for the record warner brothers  should cancel both aquaman 2 and the flash and use them as a tax write off.  just dump everything from the synderverse.
superman is one thing. he was the best witcher!rip.
I have a feeling hollywood wants a younger clark kent who may be torn between his feelings for lois lane and bruce wayne or some other male character. henry cavill would never agree to that  so he had to be booted.
Imean  I like to see the origin story for a hero I dont know well  but superman  God  how many origin films and series we had about superman  and Im not that old  I cant even thing how would feel about itsomeone older than me that has seen even older films.
I love your hair  it looks like wet popcorn  3
I completely stopped participating in popular culture because of all the wokeness.truth is my sword  honor is my shield  and the Lord is my shepherd.
chris pratt and henry cavill need to do something together. since they will both be working with amazon.
dc s loss is 40k s win. for the emperor. merry Christmas.
being a real man is now a crime!
if james gunn was involved with that nonsense I d steer away from any association with him or risk implication.  maybe someone was looking out after henry and get him out.
it is nice to hear a lovely women who hasn t lost her mind to woke nonesense
yt literally hid this video from me. in the first minute of youreleasing it  I checked your channel and it wasn t even uploaded there. only after almost half an hour does it appear.
origin stories are okay. I just want origin stories for characters we dont have origin stories for. I think this was one of the reasons why joker did so well. I dont need another batman  superman  or spider-man origin story. completely unnecessary.
basically james gunn wants a supertwink not a superman
bring back nick cage!
it really makes me angry that henry wont be playing superman anymore. we dont want another origin story that we have seen a zillion times  we want to see superman in his prime  fighting people like darkseid  brainiac  mongul  despero  lobo  etc. he deserves better than this.my theory for them rebooting the dc film universe is because they re trying to catch up with marvel  wouldn t be that difficult since phase 4 of the mcu was a bomb . dc and warners  you need to puff out your chest  get up off of your ass and quit buying into hollywood s bullshit and just listen to us fans and give us what we want! firejamesgunn  boycotthollywood  henrycavillforever
hey mel I was watching anna thatstar wars girl and when she heard henry cavill wasn t going to be superman anymore she was pissed I ll tell you what that girl anna is straight fire she does not hold back she s the kind of woman that if you punch her in the face she will literally kick your ass
off-topic af but your eyebrows are on point. looks like you had recently plucked or waxed them  and they look really nice.
he s making warhammer 40k media my dudes!
as the youtuber angry joe said they re doing an origin story without the origin. they can gas light us all they want and tell us they re not doing an origin story but come on youre basically are.
henry cavill is a nerd ! henry cavill is liked by nerds  women  and pretty much everyone else. henry cavill is simply a human being that many likes because he is kind  he has respect for nerds  fans and human beings. he is just a great frigging dude. he does not crap on lore in ip s. he do want to make great stuff and they dont like it for some reason. well  their loss ! we will always be on the side of henry cavill !
james and peter had best get used to the concept of failure lol this is going to go so badly for themwe had 30 years of origin stories from the 90 s thru till now.  folks just boycott everything until they give us what we want.
your totally on point
henry cavill was dating a 19yo  which is too old according james gunn.
well  dc has a bad reputation for casting multiple people to play one role. so youre never getting that consistency or love for the same character.
I think henry cavill deserves to be the next james bond or something of that caliber! woke hollywood is corrupt and needs to change!
we were so close to getting what we wanted but a universe dc is actually successful I guess cant exist.
after henry leaving the witcher  I was looking forward to him playing superman again. bummer.
henry cavil needs to try doing some indies
well now that dc is getting rebooted looks like we are going to get a lot of origin stories since all the characters in the dceu will start a new  I honestly dont care much for that anymore  we had some well established characters and good people to play them  that just seems lame to me at this point  I want these origin stories about as much as I want an indiana jones 5
it just kinda sucks henry was awesome  his superman was one of the best I wish him the best but I dont think I ll be watching much of wb or dc going forward
cavill doesnt play around - he just signed on to make warhammer on amazon
origin story does not require story telling  because the story is already set up. to tell a story of a hero s peak adventures require storytelling and storytelling isn t what hollywood is known for.
go girl!
even though I loved him as superman and best superman personally  Im glad james gunn is hitting the reboot. you cant keep adding small bandaids on a big cut. people need to stop crying  holy fuck  this man has just come in and people are just complaining. after seeing his work from guardians of the galaxy to the suicide squad  he can make super hero movies. glad he is the head of dc. glad we are getting a reboot.  dontbecunts
cavill may be too good for hollywood  but it doesnt change the fact he starred in three films that had middling to negative audience reception and were part of a rushed shared universe that people could clearly see was only an attempt to catch up to marvel. there is certainly legitimate reasons to wipe the slate clean and start fresh as the whole thing has pretty much been a debacle. I wasn t a fan of him in the role and think he s kind of overrated as an actor overall. the only reason I feel he deserved to come back is because he seems like a pretty good dude who loves the character and wanted to do right by him  but I dont think that would have been what s best for superman s success going forward. I believe a full on reboot is warranted and the best thing for the character of superman. that doesnt mean gunn will deliver or that I have a lot of faith in him or current hollywood to not royally screw it up  but all things being equal I think there s a lot more potential for a reboot then continuing with cavill.
I think he got fired because he never fixed his teeth
I think Im done with comic book movies until those in power in hollywood get the importance of respecting the source material    the fans of the source materials  instead of pushing agendas.henry cavill not doing superman is the straw that broke the camel s back for me.  previous articles about hollywood execs putting up a red flag for aspiring writers that are fans of the og comics pretty much summed it up for me.
chris pratt doesnt have an italian accent for mario
praise the emperor for setting in motion cavills departure from the dcu and swift arrival unto holy terra to hear his blessings. the emperor protects
a solo film would be successful. the ensemble movies are what dc just cant pull off.
I d watch you as lara croft
Im done with dc man  so much for listening to the fanbase
cavill superman -- gunned too soon by wb!!!
I will say this.. henry cavil was amazing in the role of superman but the movie was good because it was zack snyder s man of steel... every super hero movie snyder has done has been superb  even dawn of justice which initially got a lot of hate developed a bit of a cult following. snyder cut of justice league was clearly the superior version. and woke hollywood does not like snyder either...
eh these hollywood franchises have lost me. though I am excited for a henry cavill controlled warhammer story. finally a real fan of a series is going to run the show. let s just hope they keep the rop people away from the series.
q  ps or xbox henry cavill  pc! never forget.
imo Im not as eager to jump to conclusions and blame woke hollywood for gunn not casting cavill as superman. Im willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and take his word that it was simply a decision made based on the story that gunn wants to tell  and nothing more. they did have the graciousness to meet with cavill in person and discuss it with him which is more than what usually happens in hollywood  ahem gina carano  so perhaps it is what gunn says it is. I can certainly understand the apprehension given the woke garbage that hollywood is into these days but gunn s track record doesnt quite seem to follow that formula  but we shall see.
we all know gunn likes em young
people seem to forget that gunn s only real success was with seasoned actors that all were hovering around 40.
at this point  I dont even want to see origin stories for characters that have never had a movie before. I ll wikipedia their origin on my own time. just get to the good shit.
hollywood does not deserve henrI cavill s superman.  100   agree
I d rather see henry cavill produce and star in warhammer anyway!!   also  if gw was smart about it they wouldn t sell the rights to amazon  they would just contact henry cavill themselves.  amazon will just wokeifI it after using henry cavill to create a fan based revenue..  gw  should offer henry the producer  acting job.. henry cavill as the emperor of mankind and start at the beginning on terra  over the course of the films towards the horus heresy having him phase more into the directing producing role which would play great with the story as less and less of the emperor is the focus until he takes his place on the golden throne.  at which point he s the full time director producer.. lining up perfectly with his career developement.   and if done this way and true to the story gw could end up being as big as warner brothers  as hollywood crumbles under the weight of its wokeness and the masses look somewhere else to spend their money.   and it would literally show hollywood the power the fans have to create or destroy empires careers by either giving them what they want or denying them it for personal agendas.  please someone tell gw this..dont let amazon f@   this up too.
why they could not give us fans what we want seems daft to me just one good film with the big 3 then reboot now a lot of us fans have given up on this studio  I now no longer care.
when is hollywood going to realize hating white men is just as sexist and racist as they claim we are  henry will always be the best superman to me!
so  everyone is just forgetting about kingdom come superman  henry could still play that version of superman.
I doubt amazon will respect the source material idk how mych better this is for henry
Ive watched all of the superman films and in my opinion henry cavill is by far the best
he is the emperor of mankind after all.
so you want a black superman  his name is ikon. so instead of changing an established hero  they created a new hero. like miles  becoming spiderman.  its not being racist   its  giving people a fresh new character that can grow and become something more  over the original. new creators  artists  stories  new characters. allow them to be themselves and come into their own .
thank the emperor!
jennifer lawrence is the first superman.
ever notice how none of disney s flagship characters are turned gay or even queer  mickey and the crew aren t brought anywhere near gay things. its almost like they know its a fad and will one day drop the facade  so they wont use any brands that they want to keep pure
we need to drop hollywood as a whole.  boycotthollywood.
honestly  I d rather modern hollywood not touch warhammer 40k. its the one thing they didn t get their shitty little grubby hands on. I trust henry  I dont trust amazon. they really want to go out of their way to kill everything I love  or at least itseems that way.
this is my theory. james gunn is still recovering from his almost firing from guardians of the galaxy. so to appease the woke in hollywood he has to remove the super masculine guy  because masculinity bad. then he will be replaced by either a less masculine guy thats a poc or they will just not have superman and they ll have supergirl  and she will be a poc and or lesbian. then if the character fails he can use whatever minority he chose for the role to be his shield and say people are bigots for not liking the character.
why would james gunn keep the same justice league actors for his new universe
first chris hemsworth now henry cavill. but I can understand. imagine working out deligently to get into the best possible shape for months just to get ridiculed. I thought that especially feminists  who constantly whine about being discredited  would sympathize with that.
we re going to get either feminine or goofy super w a mary sue lois
this is what henry should adapt to be honest.warhammer 40.000 - the horus heresypart 1  the primarchs  20 . warhammer 40.000. the horus heresy - the primarchs  roboute guilliman  Lord of ultramar by david annandale. warhammer 40.000. the horus heresy -

the issue I have with this superman fiasco is he sacrificed the witcher series for nothing. I know  water under the bridge and we need to move on but Im sure most ppl agree. I can hardly wait for this new superman movie to be released  so Imay sit back and enjoy the colossal lack of support.
I have never played warhammer but I guess I cantry  henry cavill rules
it would be nice if a group of directors  actors  and producers  that are free of the left s mental disorders would open a new studio in the midwest somewhere. begin with a new streaming service till they can get some theaters established  if they even want to bother with theaters. pretty sure they would do well just by producing what the majority of the country wants.
they do this with everything-soon as its big they rek the brands sw-lf-dysney etc
that would be sick af
I think henry learned that from the witcher  thats why hes an executive producer on this. hes made sure he has the power to make what he wants now

I had high hopes for dc when cavill suited up for black adam...but nah you never get s what you want in hollyweird.disney has or rather is ruining marvel and who worked at marvel before you guessed it! james gunn!they will fill future dc movies with more wokeness and hidden agendas 100 .Im done with superhero movies and movies in general from hollywood for a really long time.have you guys seen the trailer for babylon btw  fitting name huh.. anyway if I wanna watch a movie  I will watch asian ones  they are amazing!I will watch cavill s movies though because he is the only actor in our generation that I admire tbh.mos was a movie that meant the world to me when I was in a really dark place back in 2013 and why I choose to study acting.and we also have our anime   I will continue to pray for hollywood  that a change will happen.where everyone will see them for what they are and who is controlling 95  of them.loved this video mel  couldn t agree with you more.if youread this  have a fantastic Christmas with lot s of love and Christmas gifts and good food!God bless you in Jesus name
we ve seen like 3 movies and a whole tv series of superman growing into who he is supposed to be. its stale. smallville  superman 1   2  man of steel were all good at varying degrees. let s have something new for the character
just to poke fun at the lunatics in hollyweird I would love a buddy cop movie with chris pratt henry cavill.  slams fist on desk  make it happen!
wb  this crappy merger they have  james gunn and peter safran have lost my respect! they instantaneously destroyed everything before they have a chance to get it going. with henry cavill our as superman  what is the point of giving them a chance if all they are gonna do is disregard it when they claim to  listen  without funding the films wouldn t be made. but they forget that without us  the films wouldn t be successful. and that is why they will never get a chance from me. henry deserved so much better than what he was dealt by gunn...
henry cavil doesnt hate the lower classes.
cavill does a great sherlock holmes in enola holmes movies   I like them  they are fun  and  cavill gets to show yet another side  and kills it  .. let him go that route... take on sherlock.. its ok if sherlock gets old... nobody cares... their are hundreds of movie stories they could do... yes.. rdj did it. but  I dont see him coming back to it either.. give cavill sherlock.... it would fit him like a fine leather glove
another superboy I agree  I dont want this again  I thought gunn would fix things and not erase the movies..henry is the quintessential superman  I want supes fighting the big bads and goin in to space which gunn has experience with right..the way they treat henry is despicable and disrespectful...yeah its an origin story no matter what  as a superman stan I wont be watching a young superman again..I agree with ur opinion on lara croft but u know the next one will be an origin again...ur also right  why would cavill apologise for who he is  he is talented  a fan and a true gent..
I got it! we must be living on htrae.
2017 warner executives   well  justice league isn t cool enough... but it is easy to improve the movie a lot with minimum changes  just put flash saving a random ukrainian family and then make him be goofy about not knowing how to speak ukranian. adding such scene will have the bonus of removing that awful scene where flash uses his power to reverse time after all justice league members got killed by the villains. that is too dark and boring... did you wrote down everything  joss whedon   everything. great idea boss! warner executives   we are genius. let s pat on our own backs and give ourselves a huge Christmas bonus.  2022 warner executives   the public is so imbecile  how did they prefer zach synder movie over joss whedon masterpiece  but now we will humiliate everyone making a demonstration of our superior intellect   a new superman movie without the actor everyone wants. it was almost 30 years to find someone able to stay should to shoulder with Christopher reeves in the role of superman  but we are certain that we will  find a better one in no time. oh  and instead of being a sequel to the previous movie  as everyone want  it will be a reboot. focused on a teen young adult clark kent. there was a serie called smallville some years ago  that run for 10 seasons  and showed young clarkat multiple adventures before turning into superman  but we will do a better job creating a better history crammed into just 2 hours! let s again pat our own backs!james gunn   outstanding! great ideas boss. Im on my way to create an epic experience! it will make Christian bale and heath ledger batman trilogy look like a highschool movie project. warner executives   oh  I just remembered one thing... there was a superman movie around 2006. and the lex luthor was magnificent so let s get the same actor and await the praise from such choice. this is definitive and cant be changed  gunn  get in touch with kevin spacey because he will be in the movie  no matter what. gunn   okey-dokey!
I have been boycotting warner bros since dc said  dont like our politics  go buy somewhere else  I have been doing manga ever since and also eric july s isom  1 by rippaverse publishing is the 1st comic I bought since dc told me to buy somewhere else lmao!! I love razorfist s novella as well.
great video. nobody wants another superman s reboot.
I am not sure that james gunn is going to be good for dc. I am hearing that gunn wants to run with robert pattinson as batman  and seeing twitter pitching who should replace cavill   let s just say that these guys are beta and vanilla as all hell.
so what james gunn wants is another smallville  wtf!!
any person who so casually jokes about pedo-stuff doesnt have the moral or values to write superman.
so who doesnt hollywood hate  hah.
nice to see some americans defending henry
obviously woke hollywood has eyes and ears on the antI woke agenda youtubers  away tubers sounds more catchy .do you think our like-minded crowd of away tubers unanimously propping up henry or any other based actor hurts them in the long run
they really did him wrong
noone deserves superman.
I think the reason they like the origin storys is cause there trying to portray them as young cause of there disgusting pedophilia
I was looking forward to seeing henry cavill returning as superman  to face a heavy hitting villian like brainiac or darkseid. Im now boycotting both dc and marvel movies. get woke  go broke.
Ive never liked superman as a character.  its been poorly written from the start.  oh  he s too powerful to have any real challenge from his enemies   let s give him an allergy to green rocks.  he comes from a different world   well  the giant s on his spandex actually stands for  hope  where he s from.  his true identity too easy to spot   give him glasses.  people seeing him changing into thatspandex   phonebooths.  he has no real personality   well  we ll get back to you on that one...
I thought james gunn was going to save dc but he s making it worse. I wont be watching the michael b jordan version of superman or whoever else they cast as him.
he could play sentry on mcu !
I stopped watching most everything from movies to shows of any kind. people need to stop wasting money on hollywood then that will get their attention.
honestly smallville already covered clark kent before he became superman. wouldn t it be plagiarizing do redo what s already been shown
I could see hayley atwell as a tomb raider actress  or even alexandra daddario  so many curvy women that could play a true to the classic tomb raider.
he is a superman and deserves better dc and james gunn should be ashamed
the whole young origin story was one of the biggest reasons I disliked the uncharted movie. it would have worked so well as periodic flashbacks like they did in the games
I thought he was great in superman its their loss
henry caville embodies the characteristics of super man  not unlike george and Christopher reeves  no relation  before him. chris pratt seems cool  but is a constant target by the  woke  left. however he s kind  yet goofy  like mario. so 2023 super man- henry caville  no one else will be accepted. super mario- chris pratt  legitimately  deal with it  woke  idiots.
for years  I have hoped  and prayed that wbd would steer the dceu forward. I was clearly wrong  and I am done with dc films entirely. I have never supported fan toxicity or boycotting in my life  but now I stand before you all today as a broken dc fan  hoping that the extreme  non violent  backlash will force them to reconsider. I had my doubts about james gunn  but decided to give him the benefit of the doubt  man of us did. clearly  that was a mistake  and Im done tolerating this abuse of power. I encourage fans to stand tall and shout enough is enough. form  petitions  protests  and spread the word on social media  to show them that we are not asking or begging anymore  but are demanding the dceu we ve been craving for years. this decision is not only unfair to the billions of dedicated fans  but it is a even more major blow to the actors  writers  and crew  who have put their literal blood  sweat  and tears into this universe  despite how fractured it is. I encourage the majority of the fans to stand tall and fight this  injustice  against the dceu. it will honestly still be a sad day if the backlash does convince them to turn tail and keep the current dceu  because that would ve meant that it took toxic behavior to actually make a change  but there comes a time in all our lives  where itsometimes pays off to be a little selfish every once in a while.so as a broken dc film fan  all I can say is  notourdcu  firejamesgunn  justiceforthedceu  restorethesnyderverse
my superman henry cavill
without the progressive  diverse  woke nonsense cavill could ve been the leo dicaprio of this generation.
you should play lara croft in tomb raider!
henry cavill should still be playing superman. james gunn has proven not to be trusted! a superman in his early years is just an extension of an origin story. henry cavill is fired from portraying superman  yet jj abrams  and ta nahesI coates  black superman clark kent period piece is still moving forward. that makes no sense at all! cavill playing an other dc character is a downgrade.
I think youre going too deep into this. zaslav is a penny pincher. the only successful movies that dc has had up to this point are aquaman and wonder woman. the dceu at this point is poisoned  and you cant justify the salaries of some of the stars anymore for a universe thats already tainted. could they have done a soft reboot and kept henry  sure  but I think they really want a clean break with younger actors that demand a lower rate.
ty  like did everyone forgot 2015 ! james gunn creepy tweets
I partially understand why they keep going younger  they want cheaper unknown actors to build a long time franchise around for the next 10   years  that why every version of spider-man we get keeps getting younger and younger. the problem with that is the actor never really has time to grow into the roll  think rdj or hugh jackman.  this was a damn stupid move on their part because you can rebuild a house and still keep a solid foundation and nobody would have been more solid then cavill   now they re just lost.
they hate him so much he was superman the witcher up for bond and now is warhammer lol.
true  the are making mostly shit this days
he s the best superman and the only witcher. without henry  superman is just a man.
this whole  they re trying to brainwash the next generation  thing is a non-starter.  melonie  youre giving these people way too much credit.  they re not nearly smart enough to even attempt to pull something like that off.  they just want to be popular at cocktail parties.  sure  tds has a lot to do with it  but that has a very short half-life and will be played out soon.
henry cavil sometimes looks better than chris hemsworth  maybe he should be thor.
hollywood hates cavill  the guy is an in-demand actor and would have no issue getting acting jobs. I would go as far as to say his situation is better than most actors who come into the business  lands a breakout role and drift into obscurity given how competitive it is to land acting jobs in the his day and age.overall now that cavill is free of these long term contracts that tends to be associated with comic book films I can only hope he gets cast in gal gadot cleopatra film. I love see cavill in a role where he s competing for the big acting prizes.
origin stories are fine if they go somewhere. lately they make such crappy movies that they never make the sequels.
speaking of which since you said it melonie. why dont you be the next laura croft   you know everything   tombraider... I think you should do it
I dont understand why everyone is blaming james gunn for the  hard reboot  of  dceu.  you guys do realize that a decision to just nuke a cinematic universe and start over from scratch cant be made by him.  only david zaslav can make a call like that.
cant wait until they spend hundreds of millions of dollars only to watch it flop hard
as with chris pratt  I dont know what cavill s politics are  and I prefer it that way. unfortunately  with the woke taliban  if you dont openly and loudly profess the articles of their twisted religion  you are punished as a political infidel. on the other hand you have gunn  who thinks child sexual abuse is funny. which sort of person are you willing to support  I guess disney and warner bros. have made their choice - which is why I wont give either of them my money.
mel sent you an email with some useful info in it
I like cavill as much as the next fan  and agree with the basic premise that he deserves good roles  but almost everything here is pure speculation.
melonie you are letting your dislike for wokeness cloud your judgement here and your tweet is a perfect example of that. why does cavill deserve top tier leading man roles  because he shares the values you like  you are starting to sound like the woke people  they couldn t careless if hollywood makes money as long as the people who share their values get cast. they too think that if you do what they like race sex swap characters  add lgbt themes  etc to be more  diversity and add more representation  it would lead to hollywood making more money but we all know thats not the case.  the last movie cavill led  night hunter in 2018  only made 1million at the box office  from a business perspective any movie studio would be foolish to cast henry cavill as the lead this is probably why he s been doing mostly netflix stuff lately . outside of the dc projects  nothing henry cavill starred in has made much money so I dont understand why you think casting henry cavill or any other actor like him that the fans like would lead to hollywood making more money.  if cavill wants to be a top tier leading man in hollywood he has to earn it just like chris pratt did.its important for fans to understand that these companies are taking in all the risk. if they make henry cavill the lead in their movie to please the fans and it flops the studio suffers not the fans. if crystal dynamics makes the tomb raider game that melonie wants and it flops  crystal dynamics loses millions and possibly the whole studio while melonie loses nothing. its easy to offer these companies suggestions and recommendations of what they should do when you dont have any skin in the game  but you need to look at situations like these from both perspectives.
he doesnt want to be part of this vile bubble
I disagree with that its for  stupid reasons . I think I lot of people forget that prior to james gunn  wb had 10 years with henry  and what did they do with him  absolutely nothing. send your hate to wb they re the one that had all of your hopes up  but no plan what so ever. its a messy business and its very unfortunate for anything who liked henry and his version of superman. they also have questionable actors like amber and ezra. had to be done someday. if y all showed up to the cinema  they would have continued it. sad news regardless  but thats life  we dont always get what we want. and I know some people may class this decision as  woke . nah 100  about making money. Im a dc fan  and even I admit it was a mess. but if he s already in talks from giving jason  lobo  what does that tell you about james character  youre fired  I appreciate you  and I still want you part of dc studios. if you haven t noticed  james is loyal to his actors he works with
in the golden age of hollywood he would have been a mega star. in woke hollywood he s public enemy  1.
I think going away from the synder verse is good and bad yes henry is a great role model and superman persona but the synder verse was way to serious it was not fun and gunn is a fun writer and likes some silly elements in his writing.. also I dont see  the studio having the money to pay for henry  gadot and batfleck... so as a huge dc fan and someone who thinks gunn is a talent who can do this. I will sit back and wait and see. honestly he cant do anymore damage to the brand then has already been done
I actually  like the fact that cavill is not returning as superman  and everything that was the snyder crap  is truly thrown to the garbage can. they want to start with a clean slate  and having him back  would mean having all those snyder suckers trying to pull things  and also the rock was going to be directly involved with the production of mos2  and having supes already playing second fiddle to black adam  was already damn wrong. I dont like james gunn  but this is a step on the right direction  and they re putting superman first in the line. let s see how the movie comes out. james gunn is speaking about a younger superman  and I think they re going on the direction matt reeves went with the batman  which is a younger  unrefined batman.
in an era of victimhood  anything prime is kryptonite.
hard disagree melonie. the anti-woke crowd want to  justifiably  complain about mary sues  but they also want to complain about characters having to undergo the hero s journey. nina infinity was complaining about this on her livestream the other day  but she couldn t articulate why she had issue with it. gary from nerdrotic seems to complain about this compulsively even after determining the movie to be good. origin stories and younger versions of characters have become something thats  cool  to hate on. I just care if its good. and if they re starting a new continuity  they should start at the beginning of the story. we all praised the mcu for its initial pacing and  rightfully  criticized the dceu for foregoing the steps. the whole idea of gunn s 10-year plan is to take the time they should ve taken in the first place. iron man 1 is the best iron man film by a country mile and he is by no means at his most experienced.
she almost at 100k subs sliver plate is going to come!!!
@1corinthians118  I disagree. james gunn has done an excellent job casting the guardians of the galaxy and his suicide squad members  I dont think he is going to cast a feminine superman but only time will tell.
indeed so.
she is exactly right nobody asked for another smallville or superman origin story.  certainly not a young alternate gay superman story.  the mistake dc made with superman is not just starting up superman as normal mid 30 s fighting another compelling supervillain and not the damn origin story again and again.  there has probably been 1000 comics on superman dc had to have several cool villains that would have been great for the big screen.  if anything dc dropped the ball for not getting a man of steel sequel out 5 or 6 years ago and not go the marvel cross over route.  but we dont want to have a strong straight leading male action star might be bad for business modern women need no man to keep them down especially in hollywood.  superman returns I liked years ago it just didn t make a lot of money and I thought that deserved a sequel.  Imean there has to be more villains than lex luther and general zod.  right now the market is just over saturated with superhero movies and sequels buring out the genre as a whole.  so no matter who they get as the next superman it probably wont do that well.  if they were going with a luther in an exo suit route that could be pretty cool but by this point everything has been overly done in ironman and everything else.
I think you are really reaching here melonie. cavill was a great superman but that doesnt change the fact that while he has many fans online he has never been a box office draw. there is also the issue of cavill being difficult to work with. he has no loyalty and had no problem abandoning the witcher putting netflix in a bind. he also refused to do the superman cameo in shazam forcing wb to have to use a body double. there are also unconfirmed reports that the reason he wasn t superman for so long after justice league released was because he asked for way too much money. behind the scenes  cavill honestly sounds like a diva  and I can understand why hollywood wouldn t like someone like that. there s also the most obvious explanation here that james gunn wants to separate his dc universe from snyder s and hiring new actors is one way to do that. not every decision hollywood makes is based on woke ideology.
they better not be doing some jonathon kent bs!
nothing being wrong with being woke  but they need to create more strong characters for all kinds of men and woman from different backgrounds. I love henry as superman and gal gadot as wonder woman. such a shame. also alicia vikander as lara croft was great. seeing more of these characters in their prime is what everyone wanted.
henry cavill and also chris pratt do good in not be too vokal on the internet. as chris gore said in an interview actors should shut up more often then not .
what will happen is very simple  the film will be a failure  after one or two more films that are the same  if they are failures  you will end up being fired  then a director comes along  and everything goes back to the same. cant please everyone but learn to give what fans want.
yeah im pretty nervous what this dude james gunn is going to do with the character. im pretty sure he got fired for some gross comments including kids or something years ago!
for the emperor!!!
Im telling ya melonie one of many conspiracies. they are gonna re.cast nothing but teen 20 yr old kids to play the heroes cause h.wood is creepy   obsessed with youth. there allergic to main characters being 35 or older. Im 36 and between big screen and cw I have no representation. lol all my heroes are forever stuck in highschool!!!! lame.
its their loss. and Imean that for dc and hollywood in general.
dude henry cavil and the warhammer ever movie f     sign me up.
you bought the drunk3po plushie nice

henry isn t in the next superman movie because wb wants to get rid of the snyderverse and go with an uplifting superman like Christopher reeve.
I agree with melonie.better things are coming. this is a blessing. too much of a coincidence  the way he left the witcher and now this. they know he is outspoken and they dont like that.as for why they re turning to origin types of stories they re targeting rhe grettas of this world. through younger actors   actresses and characters they can distribute the message  their agenda  to those that will be in power  govt  public institutions  education  military  private companies  in a decade or so. those they cannot reach or convert or submit now  from ages 30 onwards   are now dispensable and a target. age of cavill  age of garano and gunn I again fully agree with melonie.  actually   there s even no need to listen to or read about allegations  itsuffices to read from him or listen to him directly and add in what he does. he is one of them  you know their kind   and you know many loved their hops to a certain island .
they call that entertainment  7 55
if the fans had an issue with seeing super heroes age then the film logan would have been a major flop. I was so looking forward to henry being superman again sigh
it was a huge disappointment they didnt make 10 superman movies with him already before he gets old. or maybe its because supermans villains suck   they want to start over again with smallvile and superman fighting zod again with a another actor. they said superman has like 50 writers  why dont they make up some new villains for the current superman to fight.
thanks!
he made disgusting jokes about child abuse.
youre amazing  thank you!
I love the character s backstory. but theres probably the same amount of content showing that as there is content of  superman being superman.  like they do for every fyucking batman movie. if the viewer doesnt know by the time they watch the movie thatspoiler bat boy s parents die. then they should have watched a youtube video explaining it or any of the dozen older bat fuck videos.
james gun likes em young
they got rid of cavill  cos black adam tanked.. had it done well  they would ve continued w the  snyder   esque _verse.. that  plus cavill s legit too old.. wb s trynna do a 10 plus yr slate of movies.. unfortunately  cavill s legit on the  40 ish to 50 ish  looking side.. wb shareholders are legit done w the whole back   forth nonsense thats been going on over there for the past 10yrs now.. they legit want a new solid start  where all of their movies moving forward have some semblance of cohesion.. anyways  thats why they chose to not continue w cavill..
sick and tired of being sick and tired of the bs
ecactly! I love your content! you have hit it on. the head! can you marry me
talk about a slim beauty. juicy
an earlier part of supermans life  thats whats always bin produced and only bin produced! aside from cartoon superman theres never existed anything other than supermans early life. I asume theyre recast superman but as a woman. im confident thats what going to happen.
Im surpeised to say but I agree with her 100
james gunn didn t promise henry cavill anything the people who gave the rock the permission to bring henry cavill into black adam and the rock promised the studio a big box-office  and black adam didn t make money
said it day one gunn committed career sooahsighd
I refuse to watch woke dc wb ever again and their partner hbomax stop watching them all together!!
melonie I love you
timothy chalet will be next superman twink
fnt gonna be fun tonight
not just hollywood  but disney specifically hate strong white male leads. how we know itstarted with harrison ford !! look at how many of his established characters they ve destroyed   humiliated.
she-hulk was the villain in she-hulk.
we had smallville we dont need young supes
waiting for the day hollywood crashes.
henry cavill is a true man  thats why they hate him. imagine that! a man playing superman. thank God they fired him. next superman will be more emotional  more stupid  more woke  more woman   whatever this means  than ever. maybe they will refer him this time as a true   they them  or zI za zou. can wait to watch! ahahahahahaha. great video melonie.
what a disgusting bait and switch. no one was interested in black adam until people found out henry was in it. than they pull the rug out from under fans immediately. justifiably black adam lost money and this is the direction dc is about to go. the rock used his wife to manipulate henry into joining his movie bc rocky boy isn t good enough on his own.
nooooo
fans love henry ! it  s revolting   as many fans I  ll  boycott woke warner from now on !
youremind me of karyn parsons from fresh prince of bel air
king of the nerds

and just like that the dc universe is dead again. its like it exists solely to commitsuicide.
its jealousy
the rock tried
next superman to be black  calling it
waiting for them to announce wakandan  female  trans-superman....
I could go another 20 years without an origin story or a prequel Im so tired of em!! watch an old movie if you want to see an origin story you ll have plenty to choose from!
now make the same movies for only 60 to 90 million  warner brothers has a big money problem  they can not afford 20 million dollars actors and 12 to 15 million dollars  directors
Im so sick of the word  woke . people have overused that word so much...Jesus..and its not even used the way it was originally used for
seems im the only one that didnt like snyder superman no hate on henry I just didnt like that version if he was in a movie where the creator knew more about superman being light not dark lol
69 movie is awesome
go boom
why another origin story
9 days til  Christmas
warhammer 40k!  lets goooooo!
comicfansunite   fans of the comics need to boycott any movie show streaming service  that doesnt follow the comics. because hollywood will never change until they are broke from pushing the garbage.
I remember the same plot back when I was a kid  watching planet of the dinosaurs
meh  Im excited for new blood in the dcu.
they re making a younger superman story. thats why he wasn t cast. its thatsimple. but no its  woke
gunn wants to hire a young  attractive  possibly naive  man to make several movies with for the foreseeable future...............hmmmmmmmmmmm.  probably wants to take him to his friend s  special  parties.
hey melonie is it cool if I send u  100 on subscribe star I just really enjoy ur videos God bless u sister
what..... I thought hollywood loved based ppl. look at chris pratt they... oh. well maybe gina carano...shit. uh james woods
gunn wants to copy matt reeves  the batman  with superman.
crazy world
superman grew up as a country farmboy from kansas.   why does he always sound like a yuppie yankee urbanite
simple  all was about budget... but people loves conspiracy theories. its the trend now.
I dont understand this shitting on woke hollyjoo but at the same time not realize that gw has also been going woke  nI different than wotc or blizzard  cdpr etc
the bad guy in she hulk was the writers  yeah male bashing is fun for nobody but the writers  such a terrible show  I feel bad for the great actress that was hired for it..
I been a dc fan since I was 4  30 freaking years now. I stopped buying comics during the rebirth era but now I am 100  done with dc. I wont give them.a single penny after this. I hope everything they make fail
plus they still got black superman on the slate .nope no thank you. cavill producing is a huge deal like pratt with the terminal list  they will be great. amazon may get smarter because of rings of power
when people from the witcher start trashing him   one  of the nicest guys in hollywood.. you know they are trying hard to tarnish cavill and make him less  relevant ..showrunners trashed the source material in the witcher.. cavill came on board so long as they stayed true to the source material.. 2nd season    they deviated  hard  away from source material    showrunners and aides complained he was trying to redirect scenes  change dialogue etc......because he was actually trying to do the show as itshould be done.not woke hollywood now the cirI yennifer womans power show the f cking showrunners turned it into. nocavillnosuperman
so the new movie is about that time thatsuperman transitioned to identify as a disabled black woman  and takes down his new enemy  the patriarchy.
no  they dont.
they decided to recast superman as a trans person of color.
should ve shaved the stache
I am glad he is not doing any more superman  the movies were not good even though he was a perfect fit for the role. I dont trust dc to do a good superman film.   I d rather him do warhammer 40k any day  as long as amazon doesnt interfere too much
yea they kept ezra... fired depp  .. its okay they can get better gigs. better to stay away from that organisation
@1corinthians118  I highly doubt that they  hate  him. you want to believe that  go ahead  wont make it true.
hollywood hates men so superman
dc is broke. they cant afford to make big budget movies like black adam that isn t making money. they cant afford to keep big actors like the rock  henry cavill  gal gadot and ben affleck.
hollywood needs  to listen to Christian  and the fans we cant have wokeness  it is bad for everyone  and it hurts the movie thankly    I hopeful  dreamworks stepped away from wokeness. puss in boots is  an 10 10 no wokeness  normal classic family movie.
my reaction is... who s henry cavill  superman is Christopher reeve...
of course they ll make superman ghey
what does woke even mean
so disappointed with this.
4 55 what I do I so best and what I do isn t very nice
if y all supported him at the box office and his movies actually made money  we wouldn t be having this conversation. its just economics. facts over feelings right
Jesus and chill
what is the purpose of releasing the flash  shazam and aquaman if they are gonna completely reboot everything. what a waste  all of this for nothing. wrong decision again wb  you are gonna regret this
!!henry cavill gawt warhammer!!!!!yay!! yayyies!!on ...amazon.. ....aaawwww......
hI  mel!!
well. I cantell you this. I will support hollywood    by not going to or buying their movies. henry is superman  I do not want someone else as this iconic character.  this is just as stupid as trying to replace johnny depp as captain jack sparrow.  we all know how that worked out dont we disney  ha ha
loved him as superman! dont love the melonie mac to alex jones turn  strange way to bring  woke  in to the conversation
bruh  this is the worst take Ive ever heard lol!  james gunn is a part of the   woke agenda  ... I think most people enjoy cavil as super man and as an actor in general! never heard anyone say   he s just too unapologetically white  the fact is snyder s dceu was terrible and for all everyone s praise of superman cavil..a lot people didn t see man of steel justice league. still not henry s fault  thats mostly due to a terrible vision and lack of cohesity.you cant blame james peter got wanting to clear the board and not bring any baggage from the synder verse. a 25 year old superman can be seasoned enough and 10 years you can go a kingdom come supes or darkseid war! gunn is even talking about casting cavil within dc. not everything is an agenda.. stop perpetuating hate and bs!
Ive gotten to the point where I just turn anti-white media off. Ive seen thatstory on repeat my entire life. life is too precious to waste on such hypocritical crap.
henry is paying the price because hes normal or at least try to be down to earth person .when were u last time happy about the wb and dcu news last time  marvel is become trash  as well .disney dont even start. every time superhero movie comes out we  know already its gonna be let down. honestly only last batman really surprise me in a good way .cheers.and hope henry will do amazing job with amazon this time .peace
you kinda sound like mila kunis. not an insult just an observation.
I just started a go fund me to save the dcu no bull. we the people should buy it from up under them.. let s all buy the dcu. tell everyone  just imagine a dollar or more from every dc fan . let s go people
Im banning dc studios
it will flop. it is a disgrace. henry cavill is a man of integrity. I hope he becomes the God emporer.
1st! merry Christmas   melonie!
tbh I didn t watch the snyder cut of justice league because of wb adopting the new woke agenda as their mantra for making movies. I would rather boycott companies that are doing that trash. james gunn has done some good movies but last few have been flops. with wb and their new woke narrative gearing this new superman its just straight another skip for me.
Im boycotting every dc movie from here on in. Im so pissed he s not superman anymore. atleast let them finish the snyderverse on hbomax
a young superman means he can be black and or lgbtq
I just dont care anymore
this is henry cavill fault  he has to get away from the rock  the rock set him up to sell black adam henry cavill is a fan of the material  but the people making the projects dont follow the material
those movies were mostly all terrible movies. mos was great though and so was cavell. but you cant really start from scratch if you have nagging threads pulling at you from the previous universe. dont blame james gunn  put the blame on wb  zack snyder  and joss wheaton for creating a mostly trash and incoherent series of movies.
he is straight  white  masculine. end of story.
will anyone address where bradley cooper has been   working on the f n hyperion cantos! this could be the greatest shit ever..
henry cavill deserves to be superman and the witcher and there s such thing as being too woke   phase 4 of the mcu known as the m she u messed up the mcu even though I support female actresses but when its too feminine and women overacting just to make it more women friendly backfired because most who read comics or like comic book films are male   this isn t twilight
Im starting to regret choosing to be born as a straight  white  male... not a fan of drama and conflict  should have created a different character.
Im canceled
we just dont support the movies  that is woke and globalist
youre so pretty
who is deciding we want woke agendas in our movies  in which moment this was a rule  for what I am aware of  people who like this kind of message dont even like movies that much  you are not a majority  not by a long shot  but you are treated like one now and the rest of us are just demoralized  like everything we are  the things we chose to be and the ones we didn t  are all evil and an enemy to  the message . if these movies are selling poorly now and most of them are being a failure  just look at mcu phase 4  only 2 or 3 films are a  success  and not by much  because the agenda was a priority before the story itself  is because we never wanted this to be a thing in the first place  so once again I ask. who decided we wanted woke agendas in our movies  me  and many of us  just want to forget about life for a while and enjoy cinema  I dont want an exagerated  cartoony and vilified version of reality  where everything male is wrong  if white even worse  and if its a woman  preferably a mary sue  its empowering  its good and should be imitated  we will give you extra points if you put som lgbtq  on it just for the sake of it  come on.
all I know is that I will not be investing my money on james gunns dc 10 yr plan garbage .
Im sad too say this but a younger superman  I bet they are going to make the movie with superman s gay beta son.
meh not sure why dc thinks james gunn is their savior  I hated his version of suicide squad.
I just want to say henry cavill is superman  Im we keep going back to orgins why  quess its just cheaper to produce
these tolerant diversity advocates have always been extremely hateful.
normally dont care about superman movies. however  I was willing to go support henry. that is gone now and I am back to not caring.
why does hollywood hate henry cavill  I dont understand...
it gets really annoying when you say  woke  every 30 seconds!
hey melonie  not the day to go boom cause cavill is no longer superman but hey at least we have a new tomb rider game but not enough.
what a stupid move. henry is superman.
done with the dceu. no henry as superman  then Im out.
andddddddddd Im out
he s gonna land on his feet.  as of now he has more time for world of warcraft.  get over it grifters.
I cant wait to see it flop
I am not sure this is bad news. henry cavill is a nice guy but he got screwed by zack snyder who does not understand superman with is  man of steel abomination movie. zack snyder superman is not superman and the stain zack snyder made to henry cavil superman character can not be ignored. they need to restart and erased the dceu.
stop making speculations. watch overLord dvd video first before you try to make your speculations into facts. the failure of black adam was the last straw for david zaslav. david called james gunn to completely reboot the dc universe. it is chaotic in warner bros but so is the snyderverse. it would cost unknown millions to hire henry  jason  ben  and gal for the new dc universe. new universe  new actors and only a few hundreds of thousands of dollars for the new actors with a much lower movie budget.
no more superman   witcher.   I look forward to warhammer.
maybe there is gonna be a black overweight transgender gay superman
I agree with all this. but I never bought henry as kal-el. cast david corenswet for a young kal-el for 10  years.
nobody hates nobody  bruh stop thisthimg for getting views..
dont know why everybody so mad about thishis superman sucked it was nothing like the original superman from his personality to his actions as superman and clark kent if he was so into the original superman he simply shouldn t have taken the rolein my opinion he was the worst superman we got even the cw superman is better
I dont want to be a jackass but you need to slow down with the tattoos  itstart to be a little to much.  in 30 years it will not look that good.
I like cavill and I wish him the best but  he cant play superman. he is fine as quiet  confused  arrogant and moody but he cant pull off powerful  aspirational and humble. last actor who did that was chris reeves. I think his perfect for geralt.
he wasnt that great of a superman.  could just of been the writing but I thought his clark kent was lacking and thats a huge part of who superman is
I haven t gotten a tattoo in nearly 4 years
@melonie mac go boom  I dont know why I haved the impression you made more  but anyway in the future please dont get anymore tattoos  you dont need them.
they want to copy spiderman because tom holland is killing it with the role. superman is not it though!!!!!
hollywoke strikes again.
alright alt right candice owens calm down.
the worst superman. good riddance. all these henry simps are laughable.
wait  was that actually supposed to be insulting  candace is a pretty classy and highly articulate woman irregardless of political affiliation  so thats a major compliment in melonie s favor.
alright fragile leftist  calm down.
