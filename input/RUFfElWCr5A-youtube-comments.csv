lara had the dual pistols at the end of the first game with a great backstory to how she got them  but they were nowhere to be found when rise began. she didn t have the attire or the attitude. she didn t have the braid  or the shades. I realized she would never develop into the lara we all know and love and it made me sad.
great video. I enjoyed the 2013 game because I thought it was setting up the badass lara we all love  instead it gave us more and more broken lara. I d really like to see the  bad girl  return as they ultimately prove to be more fun and unpredictable. one of the reasons why ada wong is so loved too.
melonie s analysis of the tomb raider situation goes deep.  melonie knows her stuff. incredible video!
I cant disagree. its not possible. making an uncharted clone for those who didn t own a playstation may have looked and presented well  but was overall a bad idea. they need to return lara to her roots of the underlying games being exploration games with only small amounts of action to advance the story. and I dont think its sexist to depict an action hero as a beautiful woman. contrary to what rosenberg says  making her plainer and shorter is only insulting in its belief that only certain types of women can be heroes. he sounded like he was projecting himself into the character like the men did with the horizon games.
we want lare croft to stay as the gun-toting  smart  honorable  tech savvy  physically healthy fitslim athletic  muscular  super strong  leggy  curvy  agile  busty  fast  beautiful  adventurous archeologist she is.  easy on the eyes for male   female fans
this is some of the best journalism Ive seen heard in such a long time  you cantell you put a lot of work into this. awesome job on this melonie!
here s another vote for melonie as a consultant on embracer s possible reboot!  I started with the preschool tomb raider games legend anniversary underworld  and I loved the attitude and confidence of that lara croft.  Im happy embracer s remaking the original games for those that cant play the old games  and am hopeful for a graphics and control makeover with authentic lara croft.  vulnerable remake lara drove me up the wall  and Imiss dual pistols  and double jump combat! .
a well presented argument. tomb raider was one of the first video games I ever played  outside of educational games my parents gave me very early one   and so those classic games have a special place in my heart. I did enjoy the recent trilogy as well  but Ivery much share your opinion that the franchise needs to go back to its roots.
she s a lady  a killer  a treasure obsessionfamous and feared an archaeology legend the world her playground  she travels in stylethere will never be another with her profile
as general action games I enjoyed the new ones well enough  but as tomb raider games they fall short. they dont feel like they have as strong an identity as the original games did. they re too busy  with too many characters and too much combat. the original games had quiet moments and could feel eerie at times  which added a sense of atmosphere to the places you were exploring. the combat encounters were then more memorable when they did happen. Im not keen on what they did with lara croft either. she had a lot of female fans  myself included  and Im not sure how the new version of lara is suppose to be an improvement. I would love another reboot and really hope they look back to its roots for direction.
you ve summed up how I feel about tomb raider in a way I couldn t! Ive been a fan of the games for over 20 years  and although I love the last 2 trilogies  they were great games  they didn t feel like tomb raider. especially the survivor trilogy. I really hope we get something new old from the new owner and get our badass lara back. and  about her old looks - Ive never felt that lara in games was sexualised or objectified  it happened only outside games and by people who didn t play them.
the reason that I love the original lara is becouse if she wanted something she just go for it  focused  but without worrying. this is something the new lara is not capable of. the new lara would worry about other issues and become obsessed! like ... in a super dramatic way.the old one doesnt. she just did what she did for fun. and its this strong  focused personality that the new developers seem to get a little confused about.just because she really wants something doesnt mean she has to be toxic to get it. she s just a strong woman who wants a little more adrenaline and fun.
I love your passion for this game and how many videos you make about it. as a x-oomer and lifelong sw fan  the first movie I ever saw as a kid was the empire strikes back in the theaters  I completely understand. I sub to extended lore  eu  star wars yt channels  have read many of the books and love all the games and everything sw  before disney soy wars   and to see there are other franchises people are just as passionate about is pretty cool. my friend had tomb raider in 99 and I remember how cool it was and how fun it was but other than the two movies I didnt know much of the extended lore. your videos have given me a crash course however and it is very satisfying to be in the loop now. the original lara croft adventurer  femme fatale and free spirit is definitely more entertaining and likable than dis-empowered eternal victim soy baby.  why do millennials  zoomers and leftists always want to be  and portray everyone else as victims  free lara croft!
this type of video with your voiceover reminds me of going to gamestop it brings back good memories keep up the great videos hopefully take your advice on the next tomb raider game
fantastic video and very on point.  when I played the modern tomb raider trilogy I did enjoy it at first  but the more you played it definitely felt like something was missing.  too much hand holding at times to complete certain challenges.  it lacked what old school tomb raider had with charm and smarts to solve the puzzles challenges like a lot of games from that era.  people forget or just dont know a lot of games were hard back then  but when you beat a challenging level or tough game it was more rewarding.
every single word you said is precisely what I think about this topic. the classic tomb raider games are my all time favorites and I d love to see a modern tr game that goes back to that gameplay style while taking advantage of new technologies.
really like the newer scripted format  please do more of these!
I truly hope we get classic lara back... Imiss her more than anything in the videogame world.
such a fantastic video on a franchise that I grew up with and loved dearly.angel of darkness is where it went off the rails for me  by putting lara on the rails  with those weird tank-like controls  and the  levelling up  climbing stamina bar.legend was a confusing mess  narratively  but anniversary really brought back the magic  and those dev commentaries were fantastic - like a dvd extra audio track while you play!
I enjoy all of your videos  but I especially like the videos you do on tomb raider. its wonderful to hear you speak on a topic youre clearly passionate about  and when you get going  its amazing. keep it up  melonie
yess!
I had the same hopes for the 2013 game  especially when she finally two-pistols someone  but those campsite  crafting  bits were tedious.
@heelsvsbabyface melonie needs to get back on fnt asap. she has more credibility in the nerd space than the majority of female guests let alone regulars like chrissie who s only there to promote her comedy dates and xray girl who s lost in the sauce most of the time whenever a nerd reference is thrown her way. the fact that melonie has only been on once and is one of the highest viewed episodes is insanity. at the very least the rest of the  fellowship  should offer collaborations  or appearances at least on bbc or tuesday night s main event  open bar etc.
@ack ack  I love melonie and chrissie. chrissie is great because she s funny  and as someone who isn t as heavy in the comics stuff  she provides a valuable outsider s opinion. fnt having 9 cast members who all have the same background and are into the same things would get boring fast.I d definitely like to see more of melonie on though  I agree with you there.
some of  my feelings are nostalgia and I can admit that but the classic games had legit horror moments  better puzzles  better platforming and a better story. lara is a better character when she is a anti-hero and is willing to do anything to get what she wants and willing to risk being disowned by her parents for picking her own path in life.
az abides!
I wish the creator of that impressive short tr2 demo had 5th freedom to keep working on the game to perfection as we could ve got an ever lasting n superior version of the original. but scabheads at dynamics or enix cant leave us old time fans to enjoy it now canthey  bunch of fun genocidal lil wankers.
@lokI trickster g  Im not slanting chrissie. I appreciate what she brings to the table for fnt from her humor to her connections. it just baffles me that no one from the  fellowship  have made melonie a regular on any of their shows.
@heelvsbabyface facts
Imiss  head bitch in charge  lara and would love to see them make a tomb raider game in which lara croft is having a fun time kicking ass  looking good  collecting treasures   killing dudes guns akimbo  taking out cantankerous animals  and silently solving puzzles. I wish they would take a note from doom 2016. tomb raider s story isn t as important as its gameplay and attitude.
seems to be a trend. sonic wont stop being a lonely baby in his movies either. there s other examples Im sure.
@melonie mac go boom  hey  didn t know how else to reach you  sonI hope you see this. Im new to your channel and Ive supposedly won a giveaway. I dont know how likely it is you ll get back yo this message but could you confirm the fact you do giveaways in the 1st place
@livedcoffee  its a scam bot account using the creator s thumbnail.
meanwhile core design already set up her origins story on how she became to be in tr tlr but what u wanted to do is bastardized the character by allowing some other company to rape her from what she was  change her into some wimp that has stuipd fucking arrows and add modern takes that nobody for.   the badass lara we all love   than u clearly never played tomb raider the last revelations and the reboot is not connected to core design s original timeline. and what does resident evil s ada wong has to do with tomb raider .... nothing
yeah I like how mac brought up that lara had an intimidation factor. og lara was an inch away from 6 feet tall. she was imposing. its what made her interesting. I didn t like the nu tomb raider games at all  because they lack platforming   nu lara is too damn wimpy.
ah yes  ada wong. I loved her moveset and weapons in re4  her style and femme fatale appearance. its a shame they dont make characters like her anymore.
I enjoyed all games. I think the 2013 reboot wasn t so bad  coz you know  we have had 20 years of basically the same game in different settings and upscale graphics. so it was quite refreshing. I even loved rise of the tombraider  but I think the amount of desert levels was far too few compared to the snow and icy dirt of siberia  especially as the syria level was heavily marketed  though its indiana jones vibes made a lot good for me. I did expect some origin story and a faster pace of going to the badass lara we know. given the times we live in and the fact that they wanted to make lara lesbian for the checkboxes for the 2013 reboot  we should be grateful they didn t totally destroyed the brand... not as much as tlou2 has done or practically everything that comes out of naughty dog these days  which unfortunately does include uncharted .
haha  I dont think anyone is surprised that melonie understands tomb raider better than most.
hello  congratulations you ve been selected as a great winner. quickly send a direct message above to acknowledge your prize. thank you
I dont iv already seen thatsomething different is better....
@jack straw  welp most people want the old lara back. new lara sucks and the sales numbers talk
no one can ask for a better and different  @jack straw . that would be another person.
@jack straw  have youreally seen that other than in promo art  the original ps1 games are grainier than a cement mixer. Im not even sure lara even has a face on the first game. they re great games  and I would absolutely love to see the original vision for lara realized.
@callieforniiaa  new lara s games outsold every single time  wtf are you talking about
@callieforniiaa  the sales number talk  the survivor trilogy are the three best selling tomb raider games and some of the highest rated tomb raider games
shes not muscular though thats one of the most unrealistic things about her character design. I noticed this when I was 12 lmao. if you just want a female character thats just attractive to look at you can say that.
@fishing mule  yea iv still got them in the collection....still it can be called tomb raider but needs a new lead in my view....maybe lara s descendant...
@lauren gails 1fan  classic lara looks like she lifts. she has visible deltoids  jacked legs  glutes  and visible abs. its the new redesigned lara that looks waifish and weak actually.
@jack straw  I would like to see the first 4 games remade so that classic lara is properly represented. again  those original games look like absolute crap  so we ve never properly gotten classic lara where she s actually looked like a human being and the backgrounds actually look like caves and tombs. I still play n64 3d games and ps1 rpgs  but ps1 3d graphics often look like puke.
omg this made my day  thank you so much
minecraft steve...edit  also alex
hello  congratulations you ve been selected as a great winner. quickly send a direct message above to acknowledge your prize. thank you
the whole reason why I loved the original tomb raider was because lara was like a super hero in her own way. the way you describe what made the originals great  I whole heartedly agree. I couldn t say it better.
interesting that this vid shows up on my feed while Im in the middle of an og tr marathon  currently midway through iiI . some of these entries I haven t revisited since they were new  and  my word  the complete lack of handholding is as refreshing as it is infuriating. some of the puzzles I d completely forgotten  whilst others are burned into my memory due to how much time I spent trying to work them out back in the day.  as for lara herself  she started out as what basically amounts to a professional thief. the 2013 version is completely unrecognisable and  tomb raider  has become more of an artefact title than it did in the later ps1 games  tlr notwithstanding .to paraphrase an old wings song   give lara back to the english .
there s a saying that  everything old is new again.  why not use the fundamentals that made the first  tomb raider  great but enhance the graphics for todays consoles. or just put melonie in charge of game development.
the first tomb raider on the ps1 in 96 was the first 3d style game I had ever played and the encounter with the trex was iconic. however  one of the greatest moments to me though was the cistern level. the exploration music kicks in and you walk through a small doorway into a gorgeous huge room full of water  enemies  and puzzles. that was the moment video games changed for me.
I like the in-depth analytical videos you ve started doing. its cool to see you mix things up  though I hope you keep the free-form reaction style videos you started with too  .btw  was nice to meet you at fnt at gators. you ve mentioned youre an introvert so that crowd must have been a challenge to handle but kudos for sticking it out and meeting some fans. I certainly appreciated it.
brilliant take. you finally put the finger on something I was trying to wrap my head around. it really is the  relatability  and melodrama that is the problem here. imagine if nintendo tried to make mario more relatable. are people  relating  with hollow knight or shovel knight  I dont want to imagine myself as the character  I want to be taken for an adventure.Ive really been hoping for a nice faithful remake of the original tomb raider games. right now  the best way to play them I guess is on the pc with some mods to make them work. it looks funky though.
I literally care more about lara from crystal dynamics  original tomb raider reboot from the mid  00s  than I ever will about lara from this recent tomb raider trilogy. so  I d say that they failed in trying to make me care about this recent lara  largely because she is a literal one woman killing machine.
100  bring back sarcastic intrinsically motivated lara! no one needed her to be vulnerable. her vulnerability was evident whenever you took a misstep  missed a grab and you could hear her bones crumple before meeting the loading screen. crystal dynamics  square enix should ve distanced itself from the movie s narrative from the start.  I enjoyed the reboot s . but they were infinitely easier and  ultimately  less satisfying.
I loved the original tomb raider  my girlfriend and myself  loved playing it and I remember having a photo back in the day with nell mcandrew at an expo before jolie did the film. love your content melonie  go boom
I absolutely loved the old tomb raider footage. man did it take me back. I used to help my late older brother get through these levels. the new stuff cant compare to the original. new lara s a completely different character.
I agree I loved the reimagine of the story of lara croft but some things are off in the series. I really wish they would do a reboot like the anniversary.
we ll said couldn t agree more you deserve a even after all these years and playing the reboot I still go back to the original trilogy. its fun makes you feel like youre in an actual adventure with an awe inspiring soundtrack all while doing it with primitive blocky 3d graphics.
this was a really great video. I like your  off the cuff  videos but this more scripted one is a nice change of pace. maybe not an all the time kind of thing but I d like to see more of this.
you have perfectly described everything I dont like about the latest tr games. I yearn for the days of tense  acrobatic exploration. they just dont make games like that anymore.
yeah  youre back on tomb raider! really liked the video and its narrative format. definitely a different approach. honestly  I think embracer will likely bungle the reboot. the woke culture is just too prevalent in the industry  and lara croft too high profile a character for  the agenda  to pass on   and like you said  uniting the fandoms doesnt mean canceling out the survivor lara  necessarily. they will likely still try to push this relatable  emotional  dramatic lara instead of the cool  distant  calculating one  and just give her the most basic visual hallmarks of the original lara to superficially appease traditional fans. its exactly what they ve been doing with assassin s creed  and it breaks muh heart  lol. but this is what happens when franchises run too long..
2 things I found unique about the og tomb raider  it did the best job of any game Ive ever played  shy of dark souls et al  to make the player feel genuinely alone and afraid.  it was also less the big fantastic creatures that were terrifying as much as being in dark waters and suddenly either shark or crocodile. that was piss your pants scary.  also the genuine spectacle of finding a massive ancient statue in an underground cavern after solving a series of puzzles and traps.  it really made you feel like an adventure archeologist.
it is sad and hilarious how the game that was mocked as  dude raider  became a template for the reboot of tomb raider 2013. Ive burned out on the reboot trilogy pretty quick  enjoying first game as a novelty  but then not even finishing the second game and skipping third game completely...I d love to see good  ol badass lara back  with somewhat more defined world where magic and monsters are rare but still a thing. especially important part to me - sense of adventure  where you often wonder  can I jump all the way there     what s in this cave   and such  combined with exploration being actually rewarding  so finding new magic trinkets or good equipment from less fortunate raiders  etc. is an event for the player not like in reboot trilogy  here s piece of trash you spent 10 minutes getting to.... its completely unimportant and useless  but you can look at it!.. enjoy! .
I love your narration! great job on this video! makes me wonder how tomb raider would be in elden ring style. I remember being lost when I played the first game and it felt good when I progress on my own. elden ring style may be good.
a lot of the time the failing and lara dying was some of the most entertaining part of the game  apart from that horrible crump sound effect  the feeling of impending and increasing possibility of failing kept you on edge or continued the excitement aswell as ultimately the payoff when you complete what you are doing or complete it without dying or complete something that you were previously stuck on  you know the challenge part of the game  tapping into a risk reward system  rather than playing on rails or it being like you are playing interactive cut-scenes. there were some stakes involved but those stakes made for a bigger reward aswell as a bigger punishment of having to get back to where you were and try it all over again but you could try things a different way or learn along the way or maybe you would see a secret you had previously missed. all of this lead you to wanting to keep lara alive  aswell as wanting to see more of the game  you know the exploration part of the game  not just thatshe was simply a shorter  more helpless person in need of your  protection  as the games player as stated by one of the designers making changes. as for the look of lara maybe add customisable skins and let the players decide which look they want to adopt as there will be no one look that everyone will be happy with  nor might they want to keep that look forever  Imean I would stiil pick up and play the first tomb raider game  if the graphics could be increased so much the better   but the gameplay and grid system would have to remain the same  am I happy with the look of lara in that  yes  would I be open to a system of skins rewarded for game completion  yes I would. I couldn t say the same for the later sequels or reboot sequels and cant recall as much of the newer ones as they were simply not as enjoyable or memorable and what I do recall can leave a bitter taste  whereas I look back fondly playing the early  especially the first  games. as far as the controls and gameplay sometimes less is more  yes sometimes if less is more just think how much more more really is but that can lead to a clunky and overblown control system intended to make things easier and more accessible but can cause the opposite and the early control system which can seem non user friendly at first when you get used to it it is thatsimplicity that makes it easy to navigate the game.
well made video! I feel like legend resurrected the franchise after the abomination that was angel of darkness and legend is actually my favorite tomb raider game. I really enjoy underworld as well but I was disappointed in the ending and they never followed up with the story of that lara croft  which if they did I feel like we would still have that lara with us  maybe. instead they went with the third reboot which I really enjoyed the first game and only played part of shadow and never played rise yet. I will say that at the end of the first game of the reboot when she takes out the dual pistols for the first time and you start shooting at mathias at the end  that was one of the very historic gaming moments for me and I was in awe shooting both pistols and it took me back to when I played the original tr game in 1996. I ll never forget it
as someone who doesnt have nostalgia for the old tomb raider games  gosh  did they age terribly. the gameplay loop is kinda boring and uninspired  the combat is either frustrating or boring and the controls are one of the worst things Ive ever played. the only thing that I really like about them is the music. I really hope whoever s in charge doesnt listen to those people who want tr to go back to the roots because without nostalgia its just super obvious why it desperately needed a reboot.
@lupus cairo  the gameplay loop is kinda boring  the old ones were tomb raider games. the exploration  the traps  animals and fall from heights were the biggest threats to lara and thats why they were engaging. tr was an adventure game once.yeah the controls were bad  like in every other 30 years old game. what are you talking about  of course crystal wouldn t make those controls again...Im sorry but you are not a fan and thats why your opinion doesnt really matter in this case because crystal said that they want to satisfy the fans and you are not one of them.
@cs. a.  lmfao  ofc Im a tomb raider fan. I adore the new games. I just dont like the pre-reboot games and Im not alone with this opinion of preferring the new games as you can see with both sales and ratings. and the controls are also bad in lau and those games are not even twenty years old. many games back then already had very good controls  lau didn t.
@lupus cairo  if you dont like the pre-reboot games you are not a tomb raider fan xdthe new games are more of uncharted games...
@cs. a.  ah  the gatekeeping  I see. that is one of the stupidest statements you could ve possibly said and eliminates every bit of possibility for a productive conversation. no need to argue with attitudes like this.
@lupus cairo  you said you prefer the new games instead of the old ones. what did you think the new games are dumb shooters without a good character or logic. there are no level design anymore or music or lara.productive conversation  you are the one who went to the sales and the controls lol... its a joke
@cs. a.  this comment section makes me wanna play tr3 london and swan dive to the endless city
@lupus cairo  if you never have nostalgia or experience with these games mind your business its not for you. you ll never understand
@azealia s banx  nostalgia and experience is different  he never mentionned not having experience with the old games  just no nostalgiaand if you think people need nostalgia to speak about these games  well thats stupid  thats how you end up with a fanbase thats basically a circlejerk of people that never question the originals and wont admit that it has flaws because of nostalgia and will reject anything different because its not like that thing from their childhood  there s no fresh perspective  hell most fanbases are already that to an extent but at least there are new people coming in and sometimes perspective change with time   that doesnt mean they dont have a point sometimes but that doesnt mean people that dont agree or have a different experience aren t fans or shouldn t give their opinionthe ps1 games had great level design  well  most of the time  but they did age terribly  after all the first game an early fully 3d games and the sequels were pumped out so fast they couldn t improve on it much   not saying the reboot trilogy is the best way to continue the series  imo they re good games but did stray away too far from the core of the series  but acting like nostalgia should be an important factor in continuing the series and that they should do like the old games without bringing anything new  well thats not how you do itthink about why people liked the first games and think about what 20  years worth of technology can bring to it  what standards have evolved  what to keep and what to let go of change  if youre going to bring the original formula back and not change anything 20 years later then its pointless
@igneeka  you did a whole paragraph for no reason
thank you so much  it was great meeting you
yep. I wasn t counting but by my rough estimation lara killed like few few hundred people in 2013 reboot alone. didn t bother to play next games. itsimply was not tomb raider.
I also liked the relics from the anniversary game  although the didnt had practical value  they were important to me  bc of the tricky ways how to get to them. they still feel rewarding 1. bc in this case the  way was the goal  and also there were only about 2-3 per level  which made them more valuable. not like these 1 10 script roles or whatever you can burn in the reboot game s .
great video! I enjoyed you taking us back through the three eras of tomb raiding and I agree wholeheartedly with your conclusion at the end. also  I like this new format  you definitely can go more in depth with videos like these. at the same time  I do miss the spontaneity of your daily videos  because you are good at making that kind of content as well. I feel like a combination of the two formats might be perfect. maybe you could make the intro and outro of your videos be  spontaneous  and you could bring back your  what s up my boomers  greeting because I do miss that  and you could maybe still read the  verse of the day  and talk about it  and the  meat  of the video could be scripted. also  I love the skits you make on instagram like your recent one where you scare away a suitor with your conspiracy theories . I find them hilarious  and I think if you could incorporate something like those into your go boom videos that would be amazing!
excellent vid. your suggestion of remasters of the original games with modified control options  seems like the most sensible route. then perhaps down the road a full reboot that respects the original franchise.
well researched and thought out. I think a remake remaster that was true to the original would make a ton of money. it would give people what they wanted when the first reboot happened. itsold on nostalgia and when the fans realized it wasn t what they had hoped for  the sequels sold progressively worse  kinda like the disney star wars movies . yeah  the new versions have their fans  but clearly there is more support for the previous version. also  elden ring has certainly made it clear that there is a definite market for challenging games still.
I enjoyed the new games a lot  the challenge tomb dlc for shadow was some of the best gameplay in the entire franchise.Imiss superhero lara so much though  she was genuinely iconic. you d see a poster or a model of her in every game store in the uk. up there with the biggest mascots in gaming.
classic tomb raider even felt like horror games at times . tomb raider iiI  madubu gorge -- running around in the dark and suddenly coming face to face with one of the tribesmen who  with their white faces and large red headdresses  almost looked like tim curry s pennywise. I honestly dreaded that level just for that.
the gameplay and the story is actually something I enjoyed. where it falls apart is her characterization and her looks
there s just something about original lara croft that I cant forget about. I barely see characters like her made these days. the only and newest one I know is lady dimitrescu from re8  but she s a villain only. and some original ones still exist such as ada wong and anna williams although I found ada less mysterious in that femme fatale way in the remake of re2  might be possible because of the voice  anna though is still the same . then there are forgotten ones such as cate archer from no one lives forever. wish they d make a comeback.
melonie is baaaaack! I wonder if an update of the oldest games would work  keeping true to the character and the story. not softening her up  not giving partners  etc. essentially getting it to the newest consoles and pc.
thank you for this video. its very well done with all the research  and I like how it will be on youtube for posterity to sum up how the survivour games were lacking. I recently pointed out how the new lara is nothing like the previous versions and got some flack for it  the surviour fanbase is incredibly territorial when expressing any negativity about the games that lara  so I ll always be appreciative of your honesty in calling out what s wrong with a once great franchise!! I wish I could feel hopeful about the future of the franchise  but with crystal at the helm I dont. thats why I feel its even more important to call out what s wrong currently. if they majority of people dont call it out  surely its even less likely to change for the better..
Im ashamed to say this  but the 2013 reboot was the first tomb raider game I ever played. I liked it at the time  but after going back and checking out the previous tr installments  I can see why melonie hates the reboot trilogy so much. even to someone like me with only a passing knowledge of the games  its more than obvious that original lara has more personality  is more entertaining  and was written better.
great deep dive on this topic  forward it to embracer!digging the new format. it may take forever to make it but your pro roots in gaming shine through.
I utterly hope that your videos and suggestions will be noticed by someone with an impact on the games and they realise that tomb raider fans want original lara back
I d like a return to a point after the 2008 storyline. underworld wasn t perfect  but to me lara still felt like lara back then.
I really like your video essays. informational and persuasive. keep up the great work!
I completely agree with everything you said here I really do miss the old lara and got into the older games more recently because the new ones were eh they were ok but not the same at all I hate what crystal dynamics did to her.
anniversary  legend and anniversary were perfect imo. the older games I love  but these had the prefect blend of puzzle platforming and action. lara was smart and sexy. the levels were great.
really good video melonie. I wood love it if we got an old classic lara croft tr game  maybe even with the updated tech and graphics. but comepletely in the vain of og tomb raider. because thats what we want  og lara croft.
keep on making awesome content  mel
anniversary lara was perfect for me   making her first human kill significant and a little disturbing for her was a brilliant idea
in sottr lara says  I could have had a family. everything could have been different . that one line proves they never understood who lara really is.
same story here  but I started to play the games and now I am at tr the last revelation
I wish I could like this comment 1000 times instead of just once.
@andreea deea  great to hear that! last revelation is my favorite! hope you enjoy it and one big advice! if youreach the pyramid levels  check out your enviremont very well cause there is one pyramid you can enter by moving a block you never would know you can move it to obtain a important keyitem  starskey  so you dont end up like me having one key short wich made me load a previous save. anyway the last revelation is imo the best classic tr game  ps  you will curse some of its puzzles and ropeswings  but great game nonetheless!
@instrumentaldude  I really enjoy it! and thank you very much for the advice!
@andreea deea  great to hear! and your welcome haha
hello  congratulations you ve been selected as a great winner. quickly send a direct message above to acknowledge your prize. thank you
in the 90 s  there was 2d platformers with 3d graphics. original tr was for me the original 3d platformer. the controls conformed to a 3d environment and it felt kind of  real  and so different at that time.
never played the 2013 reboot series. saw a trailer for it and just knew it wasn t tomb raider. Im sure they re great games but it looked to me that they were just regurgitating gameplay of other games at the time and slapping lara crofts name on it to try and make itsell more. 100  agree with your point about games being an escapism  even the sims was quite far removed from reality in its ridiculousness
having played and completed the first 2 original tomb raiders back in the day  I was put off by no.3 as it had to many insta-death moments early on  didn t finish the last revelation or even play chronicles or angel of darkness. with the first crystal dynamics reboot the story centring around her past and the disappearance of her mother  was interesting and for the most part the puzzles were still there  although the qtes could do one . again I completed the first 2  legends and anniversary  and got quite deep into the 3rd game but was put off I think.I did however complete all 3 game in  the birth of lara trilogy  as I call them  but was put off by the fact that essentially in the end you come across a mystical enemy of every game at the end of each one and the fact that even with the  optional  tombs there was very little tomb raiding going on and we are pushed from one action piece to another which makes it hard to go hunting for the stuff to upgrade your equipment and skills without killing the momentum of the story.the thing that always impressed me about lara in the original game was her sassiness. she was a badass  a bit of a tease  the  right let s get out of these wet things  comment at the end of the training in the mansion in the original tomb raider . when I completed the game I felt like a badass for mastering its mechanics  although the trial and error runs of the final level was frustrating. the combat was the weakest part of both the original series and the first reboot  with the second reboot relying far too much on its set piece combat encounters and not enough on puzzles.a reboot needs to incorporate the combat mechanics from the 2nd reboot with the puzzle solving tombs of the original de-emphasizing the uncharted feel of the game.
she is becoming the tomb raider  is such bullshit lie. the reboot trilogy has nothing to do with classic lara. remember how in the first game lara was shocked on the realization that now she has blood on her hands after her first human kill  by the end of shadow of tomb raider  which is supposely still a prequel  lara killed so many people that g nocide became natural to her.
its great that this series is still going strong and was excellent with the previous release espically. I think its already confirmed theyre working on the next tomb raider game and it may be a reboot again. I hope we will get classic style tomb raider with massive levels.
terrific video  I especially enjoyed the way you threw joshua 1 9 in there at the end.
enjoyed this.  I enjoy this narrative format.  great presentation.
even if we dont get a reboot  we certainly have a deceptively big game dev   3d art community who are currently working on fan remakes. pretty soon  we ll have b studio quality indie games. who knows  maybe even a melonie mac reskin as an homage to the number one fan
great video  love tomb raider... all the versions! the ps1 games and the creepy butler hold a special place in my heart
I love that lara was such a cool iconic character that they went from titling the game tomb raider staring lara croft to putting her name in front of the title lara croft tomb raider.
I agree with every word in this video  especially about the need to reboot lara to her original roots - I will add that  for me  the original tomb raider games  precision jumping was half the experience. looking at that  weird  platform over there in the distance  wondering if it was reachable - and if it was a secret. damn  Imiss that.
I really do not think a franchise like tomb raider will ever actually die or stay dead even if itstays untouched for a few decades it will return one day.
the video I needed all these years is finally here.
I completely agree with everything you said. I loved the og lara because she was such a badass and I love me an anti-hero. I remember how ecstatic I was when I first got the 2013 reboot. then I played the game and the disappointment kicked in. I cringed every time lara spoke  or should I say cried and moaned  in the cutscenes and how the game made me feel like whenever I was making progress and getting better it would kick me back down to zero. I really hope if tomb raider comes back again we get the og badass anti-hero lara as our protag again vs. heroic  save the day  follow in daddie s footsteps lara.
this is my favorite topic to hear you talk about. I love how much you love tomb raider
I would love to see tomb raider done in ue5 and remake it not 1 for 1 but make it a blast to play with combat  acrobatics and huge dynamic set pieces.
last week felt weird not having a daily video  really missed them. you are one of the few daily people I look forward to. awesome to have a new video this one was really freaking good. take care God bless
first I want to say I like your videos. first saw you on critical drinker channel and I enjoyed hearing your perspective. that being said Im on the other side of the fence regarding the tr game series. like many Ive played the original games. I own at least a few on xbox. they re good but to me need to stay in the 90 s. keep the style maybe but knowing how the gaming industry is these days or society in general  classic  lara was never going to happen in the new games. I remember the day I bought the first of the new trilogy at best buy. the moment I saw the front cover with lara holding a bow instead of dual pistols it was obvious it was going to be nothing like the original games and I was fine with that. to me the dynamic of lara vs nature is far more interesting than a reskin of underworld or tr 3. at the same time I do agree that a few things should change. first  jonah needs to disappear. I think he should ve died in sottr. second lara should be much older in the next trilogy. replaying the new trilogy I think there should ve been time jumps between each one and it kind of gets worse the more I think on it. doesnt mean it needs to be a rehash of old school lara. improvements can be made and I hope they are. if not Im fine with this current trilogy. and the  daddy issues  thing is definitely the worst part of the new movie in particular. completely unnecessary. to me that one should ve been a tv show. lara croft and nate the great are both wasted on film. but I digress. love the new games. admire the classics but bringing those into modern times it d never work and  classic  fans would never be satisfied anyway.. so  yeah
even though I never got into the series  I admire your passion for laura croft and tomb raider
I absolutely love lara croft and feel angelina portrayed the character perfectly.
oddly enough  a few years back I did the body count and apparently lara killed more people on a freaking remote island  than she did in the  shadow... .
then she makes up for it by being the  white savior in the village
shadow of the tomb raider was a load of wank  after the first 2 hours the game just became boring  repetitive and redundant
@albert wesker  ain t that the truth  and I used the angel of darkness skin on her for most of my playing and I was so so disappointed they didn t have the skins move her mouth as she talked in the video parts of the game  just shows you how much they dont care for classic lara
agreed
is this a scammer
thank you  this video took me 12 hours to make  Im experimenting with doing more stuff like this once or twice a week instead of daily uploads that I have to rush out. I feel a lot better when I can put more effort into my content. thatsaid  Imay still go back to daily uploads in the future  but for now Im gonna keep trying this format to see how it goes
@melonie mac go boom  like o said I do miss the dailies but this is a far better format you can feel and sense your passion and love for the series and itshows how much effort you put into this video. 12 hours is alot of time and work and itshows. not gonna lie if this is the way you go its only gonna make your channel bigger and people will appreciate your work even more.
4 45 yeah  the first thing I remember about lara is not her figure  its thatshe s rich and has a butler following her in her house and we cantrap him in a closet lol meaning  tomb raider s lore was always more than just her physical appearance.I grew up reading gen13  witchblade crossover with lara croft herself in comic book and yes  the drawings were hot but I used to read the comics for the characters  stories and artwork  not the sexual sensual aspect only.there s a  clueless gamer  where conan o brien is playing the new tomb raider and he fetishizes the heiI out of lara s fragile portrait... and I know its his shtick but the reality is her character is so victimized throughout the game that you start to feel like... like a simp who thinks he has to save a capable woman   like the dude justifying stripping lara of her power... he s a creep  what he says is creepy  the epitome of a male feminist.
this is so well put together and I wouldn t expect less from melonie considering her love for lara. the survivor trilogy had its moments but was ultimately pretty underwhelming for me  agree that it felt like an inferior version of uncharted. hopefully the next iteration would bring lara back to her badass fem-fatale roots. not holding my breath though.
amazing vod  mel! the reason the reboot trilogy failed was that it was originally not going to be a reboot but have the 2013 game be an origin story but they decided to turn it into a trilogy and have the next two games have a similar theme  making lara start weak  then grow strong again which everyone got sick with in shadow. I was not interested in 2013 and its sequels because of lara s original origin story which was shown in the classic era  destroyed lara s character and made her look completely different and because it is like uncharted instead of tomb raider. this is what embracer group needs to do for tomb raider  make a remastered classic era collection with qol improvements that classic fans would like  if any   make a remaster of angel of darkness with qol improvements and add in all the cut content and if that does well then make a sequel to it  which it was originally going to get before they cut some content   make a remastered collection of the first reboot trilogy and make a new reboot while staying true to the classic era games  classic lara s look and her personality.
I also think one of the problems is the writers are trying to fit a game into the format of a movie. whilst there s nothing wrong with that  there is a reason the tv-dvd-game era was short lived. people dont want to play a movie  they want a game.
ttly agree! to this day  I still play the classics from time to time and the legend timeline ones once in awhile. but in the survivor timeline  I played rise and shadow only once and have no desire to play them again...
it could be ridiculous for many people  but I d really love she had braid again. it was sth that made her so unique and special. also  it d be nice if she had her cocky and fearless personality she had. she was a badass
great video  I agree with most of what you said. but the sales of the reboot saga are actually the highest tomb raider has ever seen. tr2013 sold 13m  rise sold 11m and shadow sold 8m copies. the weird thing about it is  despite selling even more than their japanese ips like final fantasy etc. square still was unsatisfied with the tr sales  as mentioned in several interviews . legend era had the least sales of them all.
what I really want to see is a nice new port of og tr with all the little issues and oversights from the old ports fixed. having to install all sorts of fanmade patches and configure everything is not that fun. something like the recent release of quake on steam. but Im sure someone would insist on making some creative changes or making another remake like anniversary instead. what a shame.
best video you ve made  hands down
great video  very well done. are you no longer doing your verse of the day and stuff anymore  loved the old format. this is good too. do what makes you happy and I ll still follow  d
God Imiss lara! Imiss my friend and my hero! I wanted to be lara growing up  I wanted to be intelligent and badass! I wanted to be a gymnast and speak multiple languages! how strange of me!my favourite game is actually underworld  whilst it is still super buggy  even to this day  I still think it the closest we got to lara being  real  or  realistic  and still similar enough to her original idea  and heaven forbid she s like a videogame character ! I also loved keeley hawes as lara  by simple grace of the fact thatshe delivered the line   I need thor s belt to get his hammer  and I need the hammer to kill a God! ..and its always nice to know that  even as a female  apparently I grew up wanting to be a sexist character lol big boobs aren t realistic  tell that to my back pain not to mention  it goes without saying that many people grew up wanting to be lara! a strong female continues to be a threat to this day  oh the irony of it all.. this is how we ended up with ellie in the last of us 2  another franchise I cant stand but mostly because basic. science. is. a. thing. butnotinlastofusapparently .. wonders off ranting about antifungal cream .. anywho  apologies for my rant! I have subscribed! always nice when the algorithm actually recommends a good video! love to you  hoping you are well!
at this point...thats problably for the better.to be honest...this trilogy wasn t fun at all. the first one was fine. when the second one reveiled it was about a zombie curse just like the first one...I put it away for like half a year before completing it. and the third one  I just lost interest in the first quater of the game because current lara is just an extremely boring character...the combat is soso  the puzzles pretty much nonexistent and the storytelling  its just run of the mill repetetive hollywood tropes...I dont remember having been so very bored of a aaa series in years.current tomb raider neither has lara croft nor any tomb raider in it
the first 2 tomb raider were perfect games. it truly captured the essence of pure archeologic exploration.
lara needs to be a badass. I remember getting tomb raider 1 for my playstation  wasn t called a ps-one in those days  when I was 12. what a great game. tough as nails too. the newer games  whilst enjoyable  dont excite as much as I dont think they are as puzzle dependant...and my goodness  those blue diamond save points lol!
quick shout-out to any 90s kid who fell in love with adventure and ancient civilizations because of lara croft.
thank you for this video! I haven t been satisfied with any tomb raider game since crystal dynamics took over. if they dont get this next game right and go back to what gave tomb raider its identity and what made it great the fans will no longer support them.
give. us. a. tr2. remake. xdI am sad to see that the unreal engine fanmade tr2 remake has been silent since 2017     Im glad to hear that we may be getting official ones though! and your diagnosis on the new lara is spot on. took me a month to want to make it through shadow of the tomb raider. I thought rise was better than the 2013 and shadow  imo.
girl yes!! this is amazing!
there is not a thing I disagreed with in this video. fantastic.
agree on every word! here s hoping one day they ll watch one of these fan rants and do the right thing
ugh I couldn t stand lara in shadow! 2013 should ve been a one off.
yo  same for me  love to revisit the legend trilogy once in a while  but the reboot trilogy.... once is enough. wasn t sold on its constant angsty melodrama. just ruined any sense of exploration   adventure in what little there was in them.
as I said in the video  the sales numbers dont mean all that much themselves without actual profits being made
hello  congratulations you ve been selected as a great winner. playstation5   vr  quickly send a direct message above to acknowledge your prize. thank you
great video and well said  I shall keep my fingers crossed  so to speak  that what you have suggested here  comes to pass.
good video.Ive just stumbled across your review of shadow of the tr from 2018. its like you went all 180 on your perspective in regards to new tr games and lara
I agree with this!  d let s just hope we actually get to see it...
the new trilogy are not just good games  ...imo they are superb. they re like uncharted when it comes to gameplay  but the story is more suspenseful and dark. I love the new lara much more than the old one. I even wish for a more realistic and darker tone. I love the setting  ..an archeologist or scientist who discovers something horrible and then has to solve the mystery and experience many adventures.
I literally dont think this could ve been better put. and your love the franchise oozes through your critique  which was very objective. it wasn t just you bashing the new stuff  heck you even acknowledged the new stuff are enjoyable for what they are as games. just not tomb raider as was originally conceptualised. they really do feel like some other  very ok  adventure game staring a name same of the original character and with the same franchise name.
thx for the memories lara.... you will be missed. rip.
much better this time. still not perfect  but a huge improvement over the first try at this format of video. I want to give classic tomb raider another go  been thinking about picking up the saturn version since Ive been buying a ton of games for that lately. it d probably be the japanese version since Ive just about given up trying to buy us saturn games due to the prices.
honestly dont even know what would I want as my fav tomb raider games were aod and 2013 reboot where both lara s are super differentits nice to see aod lara as that badass character  who isn t scared of almost anything  but then also I love huge storylines and tons of random information about very old items etc. just wish aod wasn t that bad as everyone said and it got more sequels  such a big potential wasted cause of opinions..
have you ever thought about doing your own game reviews  maybe even a regular show discussing games of the past with fellow tubers  food for thought.
that was an excellent explanation of how tomb raider lost its way over time. I had never even thought of it that way you just explained. that being said I did like tomb raider after the days of the ps1  even up until the last entry. Im not disagreeing with you at all. it all makes sense and I do still want the franchise continue. I also didn t like the leaks I heard about the next title. I just hope there s remakes of the classics. ones like they did with crash and spyro.
I just revisited an old game I used to play called  the riddle of the sphinx.  this game is a click-and-grab kind of game  but it is so well crafted and the environments are 3-d. I feel that this game resembles tomb raider in a lot of ways in terms of clever puzzles  feeling of isolation  and a satisfying sense of discovery. my point is if crystal is willing to make tomb raider with fresh gameplay that doesnt take its identity away  they could borrow elements from the riddle of the spinx with more traversal and combat. if you never heard the riddle of the sphinx or played it  I recommend that you do. its on steam for a few dollars. there are also videos about it.
loved the original remake than the other sequels went with too much climbing and easy puzzles. they need more cool shooting sections and more challenging puzzles.
just... the puzzles. people make itsounds as if the puzzles where difficult because of the graphics  but they have got to illuminating the things you can interact with in modern games  and the puzzles are even hard  we re not morons. I dont think Ive ever finished tomb raider 4  it was so hard  but loved it  especially when you finally found the solution... anyway  very good analysis
thanks for saying how we re all feeling
I hope tombraider doesnt go away  I love that franchise  been playing itsince the original on my sega saturn. I hope they start porting some of them over to the nintendo switch.
I would love to see a modern  graphics  tomb raider with the original lara cool bad ass personality  game style and method of story telling.    I enjoy the newer tomb raider games but I agree they aren t what original tomb raider was  which I played back in the late 90s.
my take on the 2013 reboot trilogy is I like it. her being more of a regular person can be and is interesting. I never got the  I want to protect her  and more I can rely on her. the classic series and 2013 reboot have different appeals. I like both for different reasons. classic I like because she s a cool badass that did what she want while 2013 reboot I like her because she s a reliable partner which I also find cool
I hope they make it like the old one s.. I hope
great work melanie.  thank you for making these points.   culturewars
so I dont repeat what most people already mentionned in the comment    thank you for putting into words what we all feel melonie.
I agree!
best way to play tomb raider games is with duckstation on pc in my opinion  they look amazing compared to using an old console  you can even use the real ps1 discs in your cd-rom if you want to
@ninjavitis gaming clips  pc is not an option for me right now. and I haven t touched pc gaming since the early mid 00s so  yeah. most of my old retro consoles are hdmI converted and honestly look pretty great. aside from that I could also run the game on my vita if I really wanted.

since embracer group loves to do remakes remasters of classic titles I agree with you that we could see a remastered compilation title of the first 5 games called  tomb raider the classic collection  with the option to have both classic and modern controls and I feel like something like this could do very well on the nintendo switch due to the console having a bunch of classic remasters and it ll be an amazing return to nintendo for lara croft after square enix shunned her from being near nintendo for the past 14 years with tomb raider underworld being the last tomb raider game release on nintendo systems with it being on the wiI and ds back in 2008. embracer has had an amazing track record with remakes as well with the remakes of destroy all humans and spongebob battle for bikinI bottom  rehydrated receiving highly positive reviews from critics and fans alike so I have full faith in them that they can put out good remakes remasters of the classic titles.
melonie woke up and chose facts
they should do a new reboot of tomb raider  but have a team dedicated to making her somehow more difficult to control than she was in the original. maybe there can be mechanics where she trips on rocks and falls over or just slips when running too fast. they could even expand on this and make itso every time you fall you drop your guns and have to manually pick them both back up.
current lara in game should look like she did in the old school cg cutscenes and pre rendered images that were on magazines
awesome video!! especially the first part about laras personality! on point!
love the originals.  thanks melonie!
no need for another reboot. I just want a continuation of the aod storyline but I highly doubt it ll happen.
as someone that has played the series since tr1 on ps1  I d say that lara is something between harry potter s hermione and han solo.she s that  over confident smartass that did her homework but also knows how to get shit done.and originally she was borderline an antihero. she didn t hesitate to kill people in cold blood.she was there for the adventure and the challenge and knew she could do it.
2 28 finally  someone said it. 4 11 period.
if there is a reboot I want it just like the legend time line or like the survivor with more acrobatics!
I had the impression that they were going back in time  definitively as in the tomb raider definitive edition to fill in the gaps as we already know how much of bad ass she is but what about her begininng  she didn t just become like thatso to speak  that was my interpretation on the remaster but yes it would be cool asf! to see her weilding two guns and I do believe thats the direction they will go.
spot on analysis  melonie!
thats what I liked about core s lara and the first reboot s lara. she was fearless  she was funny and sarcastic  and  as a gay man  she was indeed very sexy. dont get me wrong  I love the recent games for giving us a sense of realism and the character development was alright  but she hasn t got the charm that older incarnations had.
4 05  completely gutting a character beyond recognition...  is the m.o. of everything in so-called  entertainment  these days and it all sucks. it never works. because of that  based on reviews  I never wanted to try these new tr games because  well  that wasn t lara.
the only time I really enjoyed playing the newest trilogy was discovering the tomb named the voice of God in rise of the tomb raider. for a brief moment there I was playing the tomb raider game I always wanted. the saddest thing of all  however  it was entirely optional.
lara croft will forever be an icon! I absolutely love how lara new she was sexy and over the top and went with it! being hot and unrealistic isn t problematic! what s problematic is trying to humanize a fictional character thats just being empowered while now just being hot but extremely intelligent!  as a gay guy growing up in south texas! itset so much attitude and confidence in myself when I needed it when I was younger and I will forever be grateful for that! tomb raider needs a heavy a   reboot! remaster the originals and remake  angel of darkness  and give it the love and attention it deserved!
totally spot on   thats precisely what should happen.
this was fantastic!
I wanna see the lara who uses a gas torch to cut an elevator cable to scale a high rise building and make an olympic level landing without even breaking a sweat!
great video but it made me sad to not see you at all. I come to watch not only for the good info but also because you are pleasing to the eye. its refreshing to see a beautiful girl speaking on topics I share in common especially with how the mainstream is pushing really ugly people in everything.
I searched  is tomb raider coming to the switch  and got this the tomb raider series will make its debut on nintendo switch in 2022  crystal dynamics has announced as part of the franchise s 25th anniversary celebration. lara croft and the guardian of light and lara croft and the temple of osiris will be released on switch beginning in 2022
@stan szeto  since it is rumored that there will be a nintendo direct on the 29th of this month I feel like the lara croft spinoff games will be announced there and who knows maybe there will be some other tomb raider announcements hopefully as well
me too  I need to se kurtis again!
strange how quickly she turned into a antI hero.in the first two  she was more of a hero. she spared larson when he tried to kill her and she tried to shoot the scion rather than natla.in the second one  she killed members of a deadly cult and got a knife to be its protector.in the third one  she... kills people for doing their job and breaks into area 51 and a national museum

I remember on a tomb raider forum I wrote an extensive post wanting a tomb raider game  where in it I stated she should look like bruce willis at the end of a die hard movie towards the end of the game. and low and behold we eventually got the 2013 game. as much as I enjoyed watching her take her licks  the gameplay  which I still enjoyed  was lacking all the exploration  puzzles  and actual tomb raiding that the original games were known for. which upset me. two games later  still no classic tombs with deep explorable caves. Ive been finding myself replaying tomb raider anniversary over and over more than the current survival series  and I still haven t brought myself to play shadows of tomb raider yet. all I want  and I know Im grasping at straws here  is the gameplay of the very first tomb raider game  with the deeply explorable caves and tombs  and lara looking more and more beaten up as she takes damage. thats all...thatsimple. no hollywood style story and or dramatic cut scenes  no tribes and cults. just a stage by stage video game with great gameplay  head scratching puzzles  less modern humans to fight off. just more animals and creatures. if anything  just very minor cut scenes to tie the stages together. no craftingno open worldsno mods for weapons and gearno loot crates  looting  just weapon  ammo  and health pickups no base building.  maybe a campfire for save point no rpg style customizable weapons and gear. I dont want to spend 4 hours deciding if I should wear a particular knee pad because it has   5 defense  and  2 fire on shotgun rounds.Imean seriously  how hard is it to just keep an ip the way it was intended  I want to be lost in a giant tomb or cave filled with bats  bears  alligators  mummies  deities  gorillas  dinosaurs  and maybe one or two humans.
let  poor lara rest in piece  haven t they tarnished her badassedness enough  -
great review of the disappointing evolution of lara - I agree  if a game is exaggerated  in what ever aspect  then leave it be  personality and unobtainable body structure alike
absolutely! I agree totally with your opinion about lara croft and tomb raider. it went the wrong way since publisher decided to reboot her at 2013. Ive played the last trilogy and even enjoyed them  but for me  its way too far from the original  toby gard created for us. it feels like a  not-sooo-great-uncharted-game . I didn t ask for a tr game similar to uncharted  even if I really love the uncharted series . lara croft needs to be that badass  powerful and cool heroine she was in the core design games. thanks   melonie for your great passion we can see in every single video you create. its very inspiring. keep on and let s hope we ll be heard.
you speak my mind.. the core design era established and defined the genre by portraying lara as a badass - and that in a game  where unrestricted  non-scripted player s actions unravelled the story little by little  with each step taken per player s choice of action. cutscenes felt like a reward for player s progress  the few   rather brief cinematographic entries were there only to connect portions of the game or reveal some high-level background. the amount was reasonable  so it was neither disturbing  nor annoying. I d limit the statement above to the first three tr games  and their expansions   as tr4 increased the amount of fly-by camera entries   cutscenes and traod was a vastly different take on the gameplay as such  but compared to what followed  the core design era tr games     never got me distracted from the gameplay  disturbed by unwanted mandatory  sit and watch  gameplay time-outs  or get me straight annoyed by these   taken out of the immersion to the environment  etc..the lau trilogy dumbed down the whole thing to a point  where the only challenge was in noticing   getting all the secrets - and underworld took it to the point of being absurdly stupid   annoying - who thought mandatory jar-kicking through-out the whole game was a good idea  all the simplifications took the core of the gameplay away  so that despite some nice visuals and different control schema  it already felt like a different genre. more action  most of it mandatory   collecting unnecessary items  scripted game passages to make sure every player can get through - but little to no exploration and close to zero immersion. as I recall  I never-ever got lost  I never-ever doubted what ledge to jump to  I never-ever missed a gameplay-required item  I never-ever struggled with a puzzle.. yeah  my memories are not so positive - and once I finished them  the need to refresh those memories  aka the  let s play  buzz  has been absent.the survivor trilogy.. I bought the 2013 release and gave it a try  but I abandoned it fairly quickly  as I realized I was watching  my apologies  playing a completely different game in a vastly different genre with its protagonist being mercilessly altered for worse. this lara imposter is just unattractive as a character and unbearable as a person. I didn t bother buying them  but I gave each a try as well  but Im afraid neither succeeded in altering my very negative opinion. to sum it up - in each one again  I was watching  my apologies again  playing a beverly hills 90210 level   quality of drama kind of a game  with the  supposed  main protagonist being a brenda walsh level of iq and charm kind of a bland   shallow shell of a character.oh  and not to forget - indeed  her boobs got really smaller  to the point of not really being there.. hmm  may I ask why  is there something wrong with a girl a o woman having a blossoming   blooming bosom  frankly  I noticed her looks and overall sex-appeal in the original game already  but Ive never considered that her defining characteristics  by any means. to me it was just the way she looked and that was it. the gradual effort of making her look like the girl next door however makes me want to go and  well  not play the game  but check out the real girl next door instead.sadly  to me tr got sick with legend   died with tr2013.. my hopes for new entry are zero.     ..  instead  I set sights on community of fans  who already made tons the updates   upgrades   fixes   patches etc.. to the core design era games  which make these easily accessible to new generation of both casual players   more hard-core gamers  e.g. believe or not  but thanks to the above  traod became not only playable  but also highly enjoyable .
they definitely need a real reboot or bring the original lara back. that means the gameplay too. people missed that classic lara and the way the original games were. yea  I get it. once you first see lara  you say wow she s hot  but she s way more than a pretty face with a hot body.  people really feel in love with lara not because of her looks  but of who she is. once I gotten my first impression  I was ready for the game. as much as I want the original lara back  I want her original game style little more.
I dont think crystal dynamics ever wanted to make lara this way in the reboot  I feel like even though square enix was just the publisher  they forced crystal to adhere to essentially butcher the franchise  because they ve done a great job at rebooting lara in tomb raider legend. no way they d intentionally do such a disservice to lara like this.
well Im curious what the new tomb raider  wich in development now  will bring us. I realy hope they merge into the classic lara and please just please get another voiceactress for her cause the current voiceactress is driving me nuts with her irritating voice and bring back her dual pistols. they realy need to fix all of that and bring back real tombs that go with the story and not make them into optional tombs.
I want night dive studios to remaster the original tomb raider trilogy as well as the legend anniversar underworld. those are the devs who did the amazing turok  quake and doom 64 remasters.
great analysis  I relate fully to that... somebody s comment suggested to put you in charge of development    that is actually great idea
mel knows her stuff about tomb raider!!! if you need to know something about tomb raider  go to mel!
I hope they find a way to reboot   I would love this franchise to come back
agreed with this  pretty excited for the kingdoms fan game over what ever crystal dynamics are farting out.
I liked the reboot as an origin but ultimately she should have ended up as a bad ass. it kind reminds me of the daniel craig bond. I really enjoyed casino royal as an origin story and a departure. 3 movie in I just wanted the gadgets and massive set pieces with army s of ninjas fighting in a volcano back.
hey  turns out youre pretty good at documentary-style videos!
embracer better deliver with the remakes reboots. I remember as a kid I always would do a tr challenge in the summer and play through all the ps1 games in order without cheats. I remember when the survivor trilogy came out. I played each one once and have no desire to play them again lol
for non british viewers   page 3  is referring to the newspaper in the uk called the sun  and on page 3 they would have a big-breasted topless model every day printed on the 3rd page..
you are awesome and Imiss the real lara  I truly do
top 3 favorite game of all time. Ive played every single release. the last few have been good games with bad story lines.
how about a game thats in the classic style  like we saw on the original playstation  you d think embracer would be on board with this considering all the reboots we ve seen from them  that have been successful  to boot .
very true. sean connery was a fitness model  but that didn t keep people from seeing bond as a witty  clever and extremely competent badass. I always saw lara croft as similar to james bond. you wouldn t put some  aw shucks  actor like jim from the office in as bond  so why make lara some kind of meek girl next door
lol wuuuut ! that is wild
they should remake tomb raider anniversary  and then build a franchise from there forward. maybe bring back jonah as her pilot   driver   look-out in the sequels... yes  Im a sucker for jonah. he s the best  and criminally underused in the survivor games.
to put in a perfect analogy. how they did lara croft from the old and to the new tomb raider games.its like taking seline from  underworld  and turning her into laurie strode from the 1st halloween movie to make her more sympathetic to the audience and we all know how laurie ended up from the most recent halloween movie.wtf
I wouldn t mind a sort of netflix series on lara croft.  instead of focusing so much on indiana jones action   focus more on developing lara as a character.  honestly   you could do so much with this.  heck. you could mesh elements of the old backstory and the new backstory and make it work. have a young lara be rebellious   having been disowned by her wealthy family   discovering tombs  getting in trouble with a shadow organization like trinity. it could work if done right.
you slayed this video wtf
I fully agree with this video. someone please save the series. the survival reboot trilogy is worst of all specially if you have previously played original tomb raider 1-4.  people need challenging gameplay  less action and more exploration  challenging puzzles  true jumpscares  tomb horror. people do not want dumb game helping you throughout and feel like clone of uncharted and call of duty
I did not know it was not 1 but 2 t-rexes down there ! thats crazy!!
yes  itseemed they did change up a lot of the game play elements of tomb raider with legend  onward... but I felt they started changing it up with angel of darkness... the whole  I feel my legs other physical assets are getting stronger  progression system that told you that that jump you couldn t make  five minutes earlier is now just a figurative crack in the pavement instead of a gaping chasm.  iirc  and I could be wrong   wasn t that the game that first tried to eliminate the grid system regardless  yes   the gameplay was changing   but lara was still lara... sexy  aloof  resourceful   capable  classy  witty  acerbic  intimidating...and it wasn t because of some  unconditionally respect all wahmen  campaigning by third- wave feminists.  it was who lara was from the off.   I ll take the faults of aod  legend  anniversary  and underworld over the  polish  of the  reborn  trilogy for one simple reason   lara is still lara in the prior games  with the characteristics with which she was created.   yes  legend and underworld had her interacting with allies and friends   but those allies and friends were always in a remote advisory  support position...not as active participants in the situations directly confronting lara at whatever was her locale at that moment.
very well put together  brava!
Im going to put it out there  but maybe it wouldn t be a bad idea for the tomb raider series to just end than for it to be completely finished off by turning lara croft into a woke androgynous shadow of what it once was and still should be. I dont want to see this get any further wrecked like a disney star wars spin off.
I honestly think that classic lara would do better nowadays as long as ads and promotional material portrayed her accurately. because while the over sexualized ads weren t completely to blame for the public s perception of her  they were part of the problem. toby gard left core over how she was portrayed in the promotional material. and itseemed like there was this weird push to make her a virtual celebrity which I think went too far at times  and the team was a little too quick to lend her likeness out to ad agencies that had nothing to do with gaming. but  I think all that would be pretty much gone these days and they could focus on her as she appears in the games. and I think that people would be more open to that.
Im liking this new video format. maybe cause Im more a quality over quantity fan. screw the stupid algos. hoping for more of these deep dives
my first memory of tomb raider was on a ps1 demo that included a spyro demo.
I get this is the most vocal opinion on the newer of the two reboots  second reboot since you haven t mentioned the legend timeline is a reboot by the same company . just people legends failed  so did the original  not to say survivor isn t  but it didn t even get a chance to live by most. I rarely see retrospectives  or release time frame reviews that dont mention how  in survivor timeline s case  lara isn t the shoot first ask questions later person. how are series supposed to improve if they can only adjust surface level mechanics  now ue5  the savior of all video games apparently  is going to power the new game when foundation worked just fine. I get that lara is an archeologist she isn t a time traveler though.
commenting for the algorithm. this was well put  melonie!
I wish melonie mac and joe rogan were in charge of the next tomb raider game  that is literally the only way it could be sorted out at this point. it would have big boob amazons  dual pistols  dirt bikes  mma moves  anunakkI temples and an origin story where humanity was grown from hyper intelligent mushroom colonies via genetic engineering.
agree 100
I dont mind bit emotions from a main characters it crafts personality developement   establish some connection between them   audience  however those guys seem to completely  forget that lara croft is an adventure video game charcater .
yup! thats it ! this is what we need!
its almost certain the franchise will continue with the sale all we can do is hope embracer group is a better home
exactly. video games and movies are escapism not social commentary lectures.
indeed
melonie I am not sure how to get in touch with you. I am tech illiterate.  ugh
I hope this gets to you.
thats crazy man nathan drake was inspired by lara croft. and then reboot lara croft was inspired by nathan drake lol
would watch 1  hours video of tomb raider analysis if you made it. just so you know.
you need to be a lara consultant because the actual makers of the game forgot how to tomb raider
as much as I appreciate the original games the reboot is amazing
well at least you get a reboot. Im still waiting on some news for a new soul reaver
lara croft was meant to be girl indianna jones  but with more acrobatics and no whip as well as looking badass for the times.
what I find funny about the survivor trilogy is that they are meant to be about action and exploration  yet are too afraid to just let you explore. you want to go this way  the path is blocked  you need the shotgun. that way looks interesting  sure  you have the rope  right  no  get fucked  back to the main story. the game doesnt want you to explore  I would even say  it is afraid of you exploring  because then you ll miss on the carefully tailored experience. you would go around a corner and the camera would get yoinked out of your control to show you a beautiful vista  which would be breathtaking  if I noticed it myself  on my own terms. if I cant miss it  it ain t worth seeing. that is what exploration and tomb raider should be about.
I enjoyed your explanation  so true
another fun video ms melonie!
the classic games were memorable in an awesome way  the later games were like fast food  totally forgettable 5 minutes later
I also miss the dual gun wielding
I love classic tombraider and legend series reboot was ok if they dont do anything right just play indiana jones emperors tomb it is like classic tombraider challenging yet fun love the video melonie
I thought you were doing a faceless narration  but then I saw you in the game.
you should be the lead director of the development team for a tomb raider game
they need to remake angel of darkness and complete thatstoryline  an trilogy!by far one of the greatest tomb raider games out there for me... and it had an amazing storyline
I cant see your magnificent face - sim p. leton -
iv a different take on how the franchise should return. as a long time gamer and iv played all the tomb raider games id say it could keep the tomb raider name only but bring in a new lead character maybe lara ancestor or something like that...even if lara returns it cant be a retread of places that have been done before it has to be somewhere different maybe antarctia or some underground city....quest should be for a alien artifact in my view and have some other opposing villains trying to obtain it as well ...
its like they forgot she was a video game.
I was so upset playing survivor! broke my heart ! shut it off within an hour. I hope we get our lara back soon
I really hope for the best for the next tomb raider game.. I love lara and I just wanna see her franchise succeed again
I really need to play the original games again. been way to long
the last 3 games made me forget lara as an iconic characterhow they managed to make such an interesting character so boring and canine I hope for a reboot and I would like to see remakes of the first games 1   2 and 3
its true what melonie says ..    we dont know what we are playing anymore cuz this ain t tomb raider
what we need to do is make a spoof game of lara croft using the real lara croft. we ll call it room raider tomb finder with lara cruise.
I wish in the next reboot we can do some tomb raiding.
I never really believe that the reboot tomb rader games were a origin story for lara hell the only scene we her with her twin pistols is in a throw away cutscene. but I will give the reboot series credit I enjoy the gameplay for the reboot then I did the original.
nicely done mel
as much as I enjoy seeing your face  I really like this minidoc format.
it just struck me that lara croft has no representation in super smash brothers ultimate. ay caramba!
I was wondering why I hadn t seen you in my notifications lately.  Im greedy.  I require more boom.I prefer lara croft as invincible.  like - she can be vulnerable sometimes because she s human - but protect her   no I dont think so.  you need to be protected from her.
really well written girl
tomb raider changed because most of the audience changed too.we can sit all day  and talk about how the old days were better but what if they did another game in 2013 instead of tr reboot just similar to the original tr game I bet not many would have gotten I dont think the new trilogy w was bad though. the first  and second one had the best story  and the third one had  the best tombs imo.dont get me wrong I love the original tr  but I still appreciate all the art work they did with the new te as well
one of the reason I could never get into the reboots is the massive creep vibe.
love that verse of the day in the top right corner at the end  melonie! joshua was one of the two truly brave and courageous israelites that managed to enter the promised land. keep going with the Bible verse of the day
I see a new melonie mac go boom - I watch  and hit the like button - simples!  d
tr2 is one of my top 5 games of all time.
I feel like fans would be happy w  the platforming and puzzle solving elements the classic games had. I dont think we would really need those gta super realistic graphics. Imiss timing jumps and manual grab. thats how youreally immerse the player. make them feel like every move counts.also  for me the issue w  the reboots was the boring trinity continuation. continuing the story for 3 games wasn t as interesting as tlr aod trilogy could have been. in all honesty  thatshould be the direction of the franchise. redo the tlr aod trilogy. that not only satisfies old fans but gives the new ones too.
they should have left the original alone their was nothing wrong at all with the original.thats why I cant stand when there always a need tochange games aswell movies but your talking about games.thank youmelonie for another wonderful topicfrom you.takecare melonie
really enjoyed the triI gameplay.
I 100  support your channel and support you awesome video game footage lara croft can dress anyway lara croft wants I 100  support women like lara croft who wears skimpy outfits
going with a more structured video format instead of the stream of thought style eh  I can dig it.
I have only played the begging of the first game. I never had it on pc  did not have playstation. Ive played the one from ds  xbox 360  and Im working on the 2013. I want to play the classic games from 1996-2003.
6 06 - wasn t it the 2nd lara in tr l
would it be cool to reboot lara more like the original design and game  I know its controversial but- maybe it can be reclaimed  I always thought she was like a bond girl who got her own movie.
you are a pro at this
indeed  the last 3 games weren t actually tomb raider. they were discount uncharted
updated graphics on some of the trles that are out there would be a good start.
how do we get our voices heard on this ! please start a petition!!
I didn t even bother with the new laura croft cause it didn t resemble her in the least bit. my brother was so obsessed with the original he had her as his computer background for years. is he pervy  maybe. but he s a perv that bought the first few games. if they were to come out with a remaster or a reboot I d jump on it like a cheetah on a defenseless rabbit if nothing else for the nostalgic factor. and going back to what you said about the game not holding your hand  which I think you said something similar about elden ring   I love that. thats why I love the soulsborne games so much and the same can be said of these older games. I want to figure things out for myself and have thatsense of accomplishment that you cant get from basically playing a virtual movie. I went on a rant there. I could rant a lot more about destroying everything from this  to star wars  to terminator  to soon to be lotr  but I wont.
I think I recall an old interview saying something to the effect of  indiana jones  but with something more to look at .
nothing can be worst than square enix reboot. nothing....
I want the core design continuity to come back..never liked the others
can only agree on this video. thanks. miss the gameplay of the good old games. and  I never cared about the story that much. and certainly not about the ton of letters found in new tomb raiders  I dont wanna read a book - I wanna explore and solve riddles or find my way
the reboot takes itself way too seriously and I cant recall any moment where it takes a breather by making jokes or  lighten a situations after a heavy scene.best example was in the last of us where after a harrowing escape from the infected  ellie would whip out a pun book or that amazing giraffe scene after a serious graphic chapter.
wonderful commentary  lady.
I completely agree. tomb raider has always been a 90s thing to me and I associate itso heavily with its original designs  its somewhat cartoonish and over-the top aesthetics  that I never really cared about the latest trilogy whatsoever. it just wasn t tomb raider. in my opinion  the franchise has to look and feel like its been adapted from an animated show and unless it does  again   I cant bring myself to being interested in it. I dont hate it either  I just find it boring.
I appreciate your courage to speak out how bad this video game industry is becoming  its not anymore about fun pleasure  its more imposing a political agenda by distorted the physical nature of a female and that is so sad
great video x
would you like to see tombraider drop laracroft for a will and explore the evolution of tomb s. you know caveman tombraider  ape tombraider ancient egyptian  reinvent tombraider multiplayer team work puzzles thatsort of thing
they should do an uncharted   tomb raider crossover.
no
@melonie mac go boom  they might as well  given their similarity.
when a game becomes successful because of the tech behind it  its difficult to continue the franchise when all other games have the same tech  now .also  when we live in a time where we cant have a female hero with big breasts  they take away what made lara lara.
ah page 3  the uk news paper  the sun  stopped printing topples models around 2015
nah I loved the sad lara especially in sottr and didn t really like the old ones
I could get back into the franchise if they remaster the original. not a reboot  just a simple remaster.
yea I think its best if the let the franchise go  I loved the classic when young   I loved the ps2 era games and then 2013 was okay then I was like where is lara and here dual wielding pistols oh this lara is woke lara
thank you for having a north american accent and not calling her laura.
I loved the 2013 reboot  it was a perfect origins story. however  the sequels disappointed me a lot and thats coming from someone who is a huge fan of the reboot  mostly the 2013 game. rise and shadow both disappointed me with their stories involving lara s daddy issues in the game every 2 seconds. shadow tho started good making us question lara s motives but again they eventually tried to push her as a hero and attempted to demonize dominguez. lara always been an antI hero and I hope the sequel to shadow will try to get lara croft right this time and hopefully ditch jonah. lara works better alone.
remake tr angel of darkness! to what it was supposed to be!
we dont need a reboot  we want to revert back to the franchise s roots.
games are games. they are not reality. however  games that have relatability certainly do have its place. when the themes and characters hits us personally it tends to work better with the immersion and connection. story driven games that is.
all of this! as a fan of the original games  since playing the first one in 96  I really hate what they did with the recent trilogy and lara s character. I found her more irritating than relatable or even likeable and the emphasis on combat made it less enjoyable than the classics. I just hope we can return to the classic style and character in any future games.
playing tomb raider on the original playstation back in the day  had me admiring lara croft as character and feeling had achieved a lot in exploration  puzzle solving and combat - completing the game such a sublimely memorable occasion. replayed again and again  until tr iI  and that wonderfully evocative theme music! playing cave looter on playstation in 2013 had me hating the lame laura drake in waiting and feeling had achieved nothing in the way of exploration. puzzle solving was by instruction  and grinding ott shooting galleries  bow and arrow mechanic was the only enjoyable aspect  a game that left so bad an impression  with a  thank crystal dynamics thats over   never to replay again. and that miserably downbeat dire unmemorable theme  I would prefer never to hear again!
woke lara goes broke
I thought the first part of reboot was pretty ok. never finished the second and didn t even touch third
tomb raider games from the 90s  were a pain in the ass.  I had a much better time playing the reboots.  if only crystal dynamics had the heart  the drive   the passion  as capcom did with the  remake resident evil 2 resident evil 7   8. good reviews from the critics   fans right now they re on cloud 9.
wow!  great video ... not sure where to start with this!  w00t....and stuff.but ... pansies     ok.... that hurts  lol   give us 30   40-somethings  at that time  some respect for creating the franchise with those sales numbers.   rofl!!   when she hit the ground ... you saw boots  a lot of leg  two .45s  and gravity defying cleavage.   and then thatsass.  lol     she held her own in the era of b.j. blazkowicz and duke nuke em.    Ive enjoyed the last few games ... if I forget that Im player lara croft.              upgrading the graphics engine would be great if they kept lara s look.   lara would  and did  definitely go boom!
please   we want tomb raider as old as it is on playstation 4   since it was famous and fabulous as tomb raider the last revelation and tomb raider chronicles
you cant just rewrite the story of the worlds first female gaming icon  it doesnt happen like that  she needs to go back to her humble beginnings because.. erm thatsurvivor era wasn t it.
maybe they should give lara to kojima or hidekI kamiya. they know best about making dem overly sexy but still badass femme fatales that work by their own code.
true words. make lara sexy again
I adore the old tombraider games but the controls were abysmall so many time I remember lining up a jump run straigt forward only to jump diagonally.my favorite era of tombraider was the 360  legends  era.old tomb raider games lack a lot of qol that most modern games have both in terms of combat and traversal.
you mentioned the steep drop in sales of  rise of the tomb raider ... thats probably because it was released in 2015 as an xbox exclusive.  it was almost a full year before the ps4 released it.  but other then that  I completely agree with your analysis ... I want the original badass lara croft back!  retire the whiny millennial lara croft!
woah! that is freaking weird. because every time I died I always felt really bad. @3 18
if it was me I d do the spyro route completely remake the 4 games but still keep it original as possible and update the controls and add in a filter that changes it from ps1 to remake graphics
awesome vid. I got the 3 newer tomb raider games free from a give away  and I really have no desire to play them. its just not tomb raider
imagine of they pulled a requel haha kept camilla as lara  and just gave us a lara in her prime. the tomb raider.
I wonder if cd shouldn t take a few cues from from software in terms of game structure.  maybe having an actual plot is bogging tomb raider down  and what we need is a bigger focus on gameplay.  platforming and exploration is more fun than combat anyway.  the weakest part of the survivor trilogy  imo  where the side content involving secondary and tertiary characters.  it just wasn t all that engaging in places.  I wanted to see lara off on her own  climbing and exploring.
I recently bought the remake of tomb raider  microsoft gave me  5 and I saw it was only  2.99
I kinda look at tomb raider as the same as 007 of the gaming world . both went from a power power fantasy to a dark depression trip of reality witch to me is kinda defeating the purpose of both these franchises main goal . also both are british franchises lol
samira from lol is like the old lara
just make a indiana jones game  uncharted and tombraider is basically that.
I actually enjoyed the reboot..... 2013 was my first tomb raider game
I need that tomb raider aod reboot I have been playing tomb  raider for years and I can never understand why people had a problem with her body .. the game never sexualizing her which if you play the games you would all ready know thatshe never had Im love interest in any tomb raider game Im confused
Imean...rise is my favorite  so Im not sure I agree. however a new rude-lude-attitude tr1 remake would be pretty cool.
all I remember from the new ones is  jonaaaaaaaaaah
appreciate the Bible verse at the end
this is a phenomenal breakdown! thanks  melonie. Im actually one of those newer fans that likes the survivor series  never played the old guard  and in all honesty  I actually like these games more than uncharted. I like the grounded nature of them with the survival aspect and no need for snarky quips every three seconds. Im interested to see how this franchise evolves  hopefully they reach some kind of balance while preserving what came before.
great video!
modern gamers do not like non-aggression related difficulty  hence puzzles have practically been phased out of games. there is no way cd will introduce difficult puzzles or platforming into future games  because doing so would lead to poor sales. if you look at what kind of games sell nowadays  its action-oriented collectothons. tomb raider reboot trilogy was just never that good at action gameplay  hence gamers abandoned it after the 2013 reboot  despite all efforts to appealing to modern gamers.
the first reboot that came out of xbox one and ps4 was a very fun game they had the gameplay down pat on that one. did not play the other games.
camilla is great but her voice just isn t lara and is too american
@melonie mac go boom  I agree with you on that haha. but I dont know how she would be given a better direction. they most likely told her to speak more  gently and delicate and innocent . not saying she could pull it off  but worth a try so you could have the og fans and the fans of the survivor series. but we ll see haha
I think I could fix lorI s timeline in one game. remember  she has a doppelganger... bam! cheesy holywood goofy fix - that - could - work!
I dont like new lara s saviour complex either.  but I do like her more feminine personality.  sorry .  I dont like them taking away her dream female body though.  it used to be ok for her to be a fantasy figure in a physical way too.  after all  just look at how high classic lara can jump!
I enjoyed the recent trilogy. what was the issues with this one
I am probably one of the few people who actually liked the tomb raider reboot. oh well lol.
one thing you haven t touched on is  you make worlds we destroy them . there are people who want to create societies and people who want to destroy them. think star wars galaxies or some of these other mmorpg. why  why do these people want to destroy the game they re playing  or are they playing the game  the game has to end as well.
love this  love you
just give the franchise over to the japanese. they are not afraid to make bayonetta or things like that. over-the-top cool handsome characters doing backflips and slo-mo action moves with catchy phrases.this is the same issue with movies today and anime. it is because the east hasnt been infected with enough the message and so they can still create characters and stories that are not biased  and are what they are supposed to be  resulting in the consumer s satisfaction as opposed to critics.
melanie.... I admit Im confused.... I thought you enjoyed 2018 tomb raider
people always make the argument that lara s body figure is unrealistic and misogynistic. but if anyone did this level of physical activity in real life  I d bet they d be toned and curvy.
...and for some reason find an attractive lump of pixels to be threatening.
my favourite of the reboot was the 3rd game....but still as a fan of the original games itstill had its annoyances. play shadow of the tomb raider has all setting on highest difficulty and all hints and glowing stiff turned off ignores all the crafting and clothes shenanigans  concentrates on tombs and artefacts climbs through treacherous paths and avoids traps. get s attacked by beasts and immediately annoyed by not being able to jump away a fair distance while shooting finds out late game there is a dodging mechanic  yawns at lame quick time mechanic  enemies start swarming in  annoyed but at least its not the shooting gallery from the 2nd game. commando s through them  killing them in cold blood like the predator. the enemies shout in fear that they are being hunted by croft. straight afterwards a cut scene  jonah I was so worried. please hold unto me Im so fragile God that writing was so annoying at times. when that girl that was supposed to be sacrificed asked why I would  save  her  it was her honour to be sacrificed  its completely normal  I was like  yeah I completely agree with  well have fun being an orphan I guess and live as a pariah if anyone ever finds out  Im off to another tomb . the tombs and exploration were great tho  the rest was ignorable enough. having gotten all tomb raiders games for peanuts during the 20 year anniversary sale  I cant really complain.
to me  all games improved from past ones  but angel of darkness . I rather a more dramatic realistic lara.9 55  anniversary was much better than the 1st  a dream remake . fluid controls  beautiful graphics  fun combat  new good ideas and so on. and lara didn t knock her face at every rock anymore  like she used to do on the 1st 2 games.	before legend  the 1st reboot   to me tomb raider was a  find the way out  game. it wasn t about puzzles or combat  but exploration instead. the scenes were complex  mazy scenarios. from legend  the new ones were straightforward  action-oriented. this didn t make them better  just different  but at least they got rid of the  I cant pass this scene   kind of issue from adventure genre. to me  it was a relief.13 00  it means the reboot had an average copies sold per year about 81 57   compared to the rest. but this is unfair  because legend-underworld were way different games. meaning that you are comparing almost 2 different genres  classics   that trilogy  against 1  survival . 2x more options for different public uses to attract more buyers. plus  38   3   12 67 vs 88    6   3    9 78 units sold per game. so  the reboot sell more per game. it may get less    due to    spend  but this means public  me included  want richer cinematic story character. that was the very formula of uncharted.14 30  if they are able to make remakes like the anniversary  I guess it will always be success. however  tr doesnt has as many flaws as it used to has in the past. I would focus on old games with no remakes for now  like old deus ex.17 19  I disagree. to me tr has been improving over time  at least in fun. and to think a more distant from reality world  we have lara croft series  that are amazing and  to me  funnier than those old games.
this is just an issue with the sqaure enix produced reboots as a whole. the new deus ex games and the reboot of thief  have almost the exact same problems.
I hope tr gets the same treatment as crash. first  a reboot to get hype. then make a new game that follows the old formula.unfortjnately while I love the classics and still play them today using the old controls is unappealing to even some of the fans. the identity and difficulty of the game can be kept by level and puzzle design.sometimes I just sit and look at lara and Im just like.....how are there not great games of this  like its just good game materlal someone just gotta do it correctly
stripping her power makes her empowered. lol what
I d really like it if they re-made tomb raider iii
I say the original 1 - 5 at least 1 - 4 need either full remakes with the graphics of current gen consoles or a remastered trilogy collection
fantasy is just that  fantasy can people get that in their freaking heads.
please dont stop reading the daily verse  melonie
yeah they can surely use a reboot.
the game has overwhelmingly positive reviews on steam  so youre not alone. I think the reboot and rise of the tomb raider are the best games of the series. the gameplay is awesome and watching lara croft go through hell  get drenched in blood  etc totally blew my mind the first time I played it
like I said in this exact video you are commenting on  yes I did enjoy the reboot games  but they are not accurate tomb raider experiences.
what do you mean though
I put the verse at the end still
@melonie mac go boom  oh good  im sorry  I should have made sure to watch until the very end. thank you
itshould have had a reboot in time for her anniversary. considering who owns it now it will probably end up an nft filled mobile game anyway.
I want the original tomb raider.  just with todays graphics. thats all.  I loved the ps1 games more than anything that have ever come after.  and particularly hate the latest iteration. and the new movie.   something the ps1 era did great was thatshe was always a bad ass.  athletic and so on.  as time progress the upgrades you get are not laras.  she just get more weapons and such.and the game play of the first 4 was by far the best.  I truly detest all the hand holding done with new games.  the  players getting bored  with the new titles.  is in great part because many tomb raider fans wanted to give it a chance.  then it was the whole  well the first game was her character dev  we ll get cool  bold and fearless lara on the next game   didn t happened.  and we never got the lara we love.  they kept thatstupid version with that always worry afraid faces.  like  God.  even the first to movies.  story aside.  angelina played her so well. that kinda cocky attitude  strong yet still very feminine. it piss me off that its okay to killed the original and reboot it into something completely different.  but they wont let the reboot die and re-re-boot it with a version closer to the original.  so its okay to kill the version that made the franchise what it is.  but its not okay to kill the version that is clearly less loved.
I like the new reboot trilogy  but lara does have constant jennifer love hewitt mopey face lol.
I d buy the old games remastered  with cheats  but any new tomb raider needs jumping less emotion from lara s personal life and the supernatural.
how true.
Ive always loved how people complain about sexualized characters while sexualizing the character.  she s hot.... its not a big deal unless that threatens you. but.....buuuuut  there is more to her.
the problem with the reboot trilogy we got was that the tomb raider 2013 was supposed to be the only origin story. still  they saw the opportunity to make it into a trilogy in order to make more money  which makes sense   but this caused the next two games to have a similar theme and the same story parts such as lara starting weak and then grows strong again  then do the same in the next game  which got pretty old in shadow of tr.
really good vid. agree.
I have played tr1 and 2 as a kid and recently replayed them and the 2013 one. im going to play tr3 next as I never got around to it back then. tr1 was my first saturn game and I loved it.with that out of the way  I was disappointed with 2013 as the gameplay felt very dumbed down. the only interesting part were a couple of the optional tombs  everything else just felt brainless. unironically had more fun on tr1 and 2. also it was annoying to see what tr looks like in what I call the  lgbt era  we live in today  back in the day she was like a female goku  happy to be in a hard situation risking her life. now she s all depressed and has a lotoffeelings and why wont someone understand her. its gross  but thats what the lgbt era is like.anyway ill be trying the rest of the games sometime soon  not sure why im writing all this but yea.
oh... my... God... youre as much of a tomb raider nerd as I am!  to hear somebody finally quote the og tr1 origins story and link the daddy issues of the reboot to the terrible plot of the first tomb raider movie is amazing.  tomb raider 2013 felt like an ip being bolted on to a title to make sure itsold.  the reboot trilogy isn t bad its just too generic to stand out like the originals did and that is not lara croft in them!  more like  laura crift  or  lana craft  or some other fiendish imposter.  the 2006 franchise reboot was probably necessary after the dumpster fire that was tomb raider  angel of darkness.  those games are very comic booky but also use the cheesy parental drama which has bogged tomb raider plots down for years.  but at least lara croft is still a badass in them!  the original  90s games were running out of runway with their grid based gameplay after four titles of similar content.  chronicles was basically a collection of cool ideas that never managed to make it into a main title and marked the end of tomb raider as a major creative force.I have sooooo many good ideas of how to take the franchise back to its roots and deliver a more faithful and interesting gameplay experience.  whoever owns the rights now should hire you and me as creative directors
I dont know. Ive liked most of what they ve done over the years for this franchise on some level  even though I haven t finished all the older games  but being a fan of dark storytelling   coming to appreciate the story of a game just as much  if not moreso  than the actual game play  I feel a much stronger connection to the most recent games than to the old ones- even legend   underworld.but  the way youreact to this   the way Ive seen people react to the jurassic world movies  when I liked them fine might be a good cue that people who become fans of something very simple   straightforward just dont appreciate attempts to jazz it up or make it more interesting to a wider audience  it does suck  because if that is respected completely  I think it greatly reduces the creativity that can be applied to a franchise   makes it harder to rival  if not one up  previous entries. the only other jurassic park film the vast majority of people actually liked after the first one was jurassic world. the previous two remained simple monster movies without much of a plot so they could focus on dinosaur violence  but were never seen as being as good as the first   the most recent two jurassic world movies attempted to be more unique   plot heavy   itseems like everyone was pissed that we were spending too much time focusing on stuff that wasn t dinosaurs. its definitely food for thought  though.
do remakes  good ones. bluepoint games please  or a studio similar to them. I played the new trilogy  most disliked it just became a gore fest rather than a well thought out adventure.  can we pretend they weren t made
there s somebody build lara croft in dc universe online
I grew up playing the original tomb raider games and the legend trilogy. I really liked tomb raider 2013 as a videogame  but shadow of tomb raider felt boring and tedious to me. and I really liked the slow burn of last revelation and the platforming adventuring of tomb raider anniversary  which imo is super underappreciated and makes me sad . I dont think shadow has a good plot and I did not like the gameplay or pacing as much. personally  I think the classics had the best atmosphere  music  and sometimes puzzles. the legend trilogy felt like tomb raider despite it technically being a reboot and a different timeline. legend was too short imo  though.the reboot feels much more different. and I agree that it feels more like uncharted  but not as advanced. but I did think the first game had excellent combat  graphics  and set pieces. I ll say this till the day I die  tomb raider anniversary is very underappreciated as a remake  tomb raider title  and a platforming adventure. it may not have the same vibes as the classics or the high-octane action and combat of the 2013 reboot  but anniversary had improved controls and lara croft actually looked like lara croft. she had the acrobatics  backpack  gloves  face  braid  chest  and boots etc. and the puzzles and platforming were good. not too complicated and not too easy imo. I would love to see a tomb raider game with good atmosphere  classical music like the 90s  excellent platforming  interesting puzzles  fun combat  good story  and the occasional set piece. but I feel like it will never get all those elements. every tomb raider has its pros and cons. who knows what the future holds. the continuity is almost as bad as halloween franchise. did Imention I love anniversary  sorry lol.
great video
I think super.mel should b in charge of the next tomb raider game!
tomb raiders need to be tomb raiders with levers  puzzles  tombs and timed events  not fancy combat and killing silently. tr who succeeded was never a survival game but adventure. as old school fan  I want tombs  mysteries  levers and timed events not killing silently and cutscenes. I dont care for physics or reality  this is a video game not a biography. custom levels made by fans are much better than modern tr games. those games were cool action games but not tomb raiders.
why was I recommended this  very cool!
a developer trying to be  sensitive  and avoid offending the loudest voices has limited options with this franchise. if these crazies had decided to come for shadow of the tomb raider they could have had an absolute field day. reboot lara wears various native costumes  and rescues poor  helpless native americans  of course everybody implicitly trusts and likes this foreign woman who just turns up in their village.they can keep reducing lara s bust size  pay lip service to the correct politics and pray the eye of progressive sauron never fixes upon them. its not a unique problem  various franchises that have been around for decades have reached a natural transition point in their life spans and may not really fit anywhere in the current cultural landscape without being changed to the point that they are unrecognisable.
dont go woke and get back to her roots.
no thanks  youre just an imposter
crystal dynamics is so out in left field that they re imitating uncharted which is a series thats imitating core design s tomb raider. if that doesnt show how lost they are I dont know what does
to be fair  the original 2013 xbox 360 reboot look was still pretty hot.something happened around the ps4 re-release of the 2013 reboot where they started munting her face so she looked a bit mutated.then by rise of the tomb raider she was a complete shit-show of different appearances throughout the game  all of them terrible.I thought she improved  slightly  in shadow of the tomb raider with 1 consistent look  but still a far cry from the solid 2013 reboot.
hey mel  do you watch death battle or have you heard of them   if so  have you seen this episode  https   youtu.be jzqvscpirfc
more proof crystal dynamics have no idea.  despite the up to date graphics etc  they still have come no way towards bettering the original - or the original character.
isn t it funny how uncharted took inspiration from tomb raider  and then the rebooted tomb raider took inspiration from uncharted
in today s political climate   victims are heroes . so the new lara is more heoic than the old one by those standards.
this is basically what assassin s creed fans are saying since origins and odyssey  they re good games  but they re not good assassin s creed games .
tomb raider needs to go back to the formula that made it good  not get another reboot.
frankly Im in the position to barely care for og lara.. legends was the first I played and the character felt meh.. serviceable. the action was okay I guess  just filler and the puzzle were okay.I welcomed the reboot with open arms and while it was too much combat focused it got it right on later releases focusing more on enviroment and exploration.lara is now a complex character way stronger than the og imho and  not only because her struggles and obstacles feel real.she no longer seek trill  just because   just to rebel  but for logical reasons.also her response to the world around her is more believable.og lara was rarely moved by events unfolding just a  ops that happened  and in modern times thatstyle as become synonymous of quippy one liner marvel copy cat which is gotten really annoying really fast. especially for me.I should try uncharted but Im pc till the day I die!also if you want a more stylish acrobatic flashy game you need a completely different style.the reboot tried to ground itself as hard as possible and I like it for it. maybe it is too much but og   legend were very cartoonish not saying it couldn t work  look at fortnite God ..but a new balance is needed.in the 90s duke nukem was the goat! the game was awesome  the character was an unapologetic duchebag womanizer the game didn t take itself too seriously and the game barely told you what to do.but one dimensional characters rarely work these days..the survivor trilogy is in a good position to move forward. if the studio reboot again they will lose modern and older fan alikeand somehow og fans in any franchise always seem to cling to  the original did it better dont get me wrong I felt it with disney starwars. having grown up with the prequels disney dumped a huge turd on og and prequel  my favourites  for mary sue and woke garbage and shitty unplanned plotthe franchise wasn t for me anymore and Imove away.I agree that modern action adventure games need to rely less on cutscenes and hold less the hand of the player..but franchises need to reinvent themselves if they wanna survive. different eras required different approach. the style of gaming in the 90s was peculiar whether out of a conscious choice or a product of poor tools.. hard to say.but every genre has to adapt.and a character as big as lara need to adapt and can have a few different incarnation under her belt..soo I hear your complains but imho throwing away the survivor would be a big mistake. in an era in which female protagonist are uncompelling marysue this reboot lara was a breath of fresh air. stubborn  resilient  rageful  with an hidden side caring and loving   but ultimately not invincible and prone to hubris.the logic thread from yamataI to paititI is very evident to me.the plot could have been more fleshed out..but modern tb rely more on story og more on gameplay..I frankly prefer a good story with meh gameplay than a meh story with good gameplay.unless is as rts but for fps rpg and action adventure I need to care about the plotI firmly believe the lack of success for shadow is more due to plot and release time than the game itselfbecause the game itself strike a good balance of every element to me. is the writing of the plot that left me wanting but lara itself was great you can feel the arrogance and stubborness she has to come to term with.og lara never evolved was dead as character progression goes.was basically duke nukem. nice  fun but ultimately you cant indefinitely carry a series on that alone and og lara started showing that by the third game. you cant just keep doing the same and call it a day.. thats for ea xd
when is conspiracy theory video happening
not that the later games were bad  but I d have happily seen lara retire 20 years ago.I never got same feeling from the more recent games..but put on my jailbreak and boot up the originals...and they are still a special experience !!the ps1 games contributed so much to gaming community and future of gaming would have been no shame stopping after first few.Im happy to just appreciate the 90s legacy and anything after that is just for sake of playing it...they dont feel special..as long as they dont fill it with political bs...cant see it being  bad  really..but if they reboot now  thats exactly what they will do.no...I ll just go back every few years and play the originals through again.
not really having a problem with the vulnerable  sympathetic and caring lara  shows her a more feminine side on her  what really pisses me off  its her de-sexualization.
goodjob nice video melonie
practically every original game thatstarted out great ended up like that  countless numbers of games like silent hill  fable  saints row  knights of the old republic and many more. now that I think about it I cant think of a single game that had any good sequels  remasters or reboots.
bring the original sexy lara back continue the scion story line and her original nemesis.
I dont get it. they want strong independant female character  but they make them helpless and very dependant on others  that doesnt make them sound strong or independant. if they want a tomb raider reboot to work they need to consult the people who worked on the most successful reboots. im talking God of war  wolfenstein  ignore the 3rd game   and doom. doom is a perfect example of taking an old concept and modernising it  same with wolfenstein because the 2 are literally almost the same game. gow is a perfect example of changing the entire gameplay of a game but having it make sense because of its story. crystal dynamics just dont understand how to reboot power fantasies correctly while those 3 games did so and made their audience love them.  except for the 3rd wolfwnstein game
I loved the original games and still sometimes play them today cos they are challenging  atmospheric and require you to actually think. modern tomb raider is just generic uncharted clones that hold your hand the whole way through cos the devs clearly think the players are idiots and made lara go from a total badass to a forgettable twat with no personality.
reboots  reshoots  relaunches  remakes   prequels dont draw a damn dollar
the woke world nerfs you  your experience  your culture  and your achievements and tries to convince you that you ve been improved. another case of  probably   good intentions gone awry.
facts
sounds and feels so professional
I vote for you to take over the creative direction of the future of tomb raider.
I loved tomb raider from way back in my ps1 days.there was a good story  loads of exploring etc.now  it is a rushed   game  if you can even call it that  that is quick to play and easily given up on.I switched to assassins creed to be honest because the tr games were no longer enjoyable.
saying that dialogue and character moments break immersion sounds insane to me. to me they give meaning to the tedium and routine of the gameplay. they are the connecting tissue that make it all worth it. I was never a big fan of the old tomb raider games  although I did play them  but they are not games I remember fondly. apart from having a female protagonist which was indeed a rarity back then  those games did not stand out to me. now do I like everything cd did with tr  hardly. but I sure as hell enjoyed the reboot triology more than I ever did the old games. even shadow of the tomb raider  which I think is mediocre at best. funny enough  the exact part that is the worst in it to me was an actual power fantasy sequence. when they turn lara into rambo for no reason. the thing that most annoys me in the reboots is the idiot sidekick  who is much more of a liability than actual help. who I just now realize looks and acts exactly like the interviewer in the amazon lotr superfans video lol. diversity soy hire serving as a constant reminder for men bad. but I digress  where was I  oh yeah  dialogue breaking immersion  au contraire  without dialogue and insights into the characters there is no immersion to begin with. as for relatability it is necessary but is not attained by reflecting the real world  but by giving the protagonist goals that are relatable. they dont have to look like me  they just have to have goals and struggles I can understand and sympathise with. what they need to do with tomb raider is to combine the best of both worlds  the badassery of old lara croft  and the storytelling and cinematic experience of the reboots. because going through mazes and traps and fighting t-rex-es just for kicks is not a very relatable goal.
attractive lump of pixels...       d
I want more games in the recent  survivor  timeline reboot.
beware  there is a bot commenting that you  won something  but you haven t !!!
I like the uncharted-like direction  but the story was just simply not there. the first game was alright  but 2 and 3 were just bad. I never played the originals  by choice  I am just not for puzzles. when I play a single player game I personally play it for a good story  so if the reboot was like the originals I never would have bought them. I am not saying that the franchise needs to change because of me  so I totally understand that it might be not for me then  I am just pointing out that I am sure on some level it brought a new audience in too.
all they have to do is make lara gritty.  start with lara reflecting on what happened and decide to be gritty.  but I cant see that hopping around mechanic returning.

I never played any of the games before the survivor trilogy. I loved the survivor trilogy  but I do think it is completed. I agree that any future new games should take the franchise a different direction.
tri-iiI 4k remake gang
when uncharted came out  people called it a tomb raider clone. Im still disappointed that they called the main character  nathan drake  instead of  tom braider  which would have been far more entertaining. but more importantly  the gameplay was very much not tomb raider until the reboots decided they needed to be uncharted clones instead of tomb raider games. I never touched the new series because its not tomb raider any more and if Im buying tomb raider  Im buying it because I want tomb raider  not uncharted but made by devs who think  depower the main character because gamers want to protect a girl  is somehow less sexist than just letting your main character be both a woman and capablee of looking after herself at the same time.
I hate to say it  but I really believe the best thing for lara would be no new games  no remasters  nothing. because in the current climate  rather than the strong  tough as nails character she once was  youre likely instead to get a stunning and brave lara who grew up with a penis and now reads at drag queen story hour at the children s library.
Im terribly sorry  but any reboot we may get will only get even worse from here.
okay  first  the busty lara running around in shorts and a thong is not threatening to anyone. if anyone was stupid enough to wear that garbage in tombs or even just camping there would be major problems. I have done both and you cannot function in 14 year old fantasy garb. the early lara was made that way  not to make it obvious she was female  metroid was female as just one example. lara was designed that way because when the games were first being made  developers thought only teenage boys played games. I like the more realistic lara. I would love to see some of the previous story lines remade in the new style. shadow was a mistake. no one new to lara liked it and we fans hated how they butchered our favorite. itshould have been the transition to the tough tomb raider we all love. thank you for your hard work but I respectfully disagree.
this video is spot on  I agree with every single word  especially in last part of your video. after long day of work  dealing with office dramas  c restrictions  complains  people being scared of new viruses and everything in life  insecurities  sjws... I just want to go home  kill some dinosaurs  and explore cool tombs. the last thing I want  is something to be relatable to real life or any kind of vining or complains. I worked in game industry  now Im in animation and problem lately is always the same   it is not art directors it is not the artist who creating the content  it is executives and business people who never worked in games nor understand art or visuals or story telling that making decisions and tremendously politicizing development of any of their products. for example yesterday we had a big meeting for developing new show that could look awesome but production and business people got involved and I cantell everything is already turning into generic boring shit politically acceptable. I was really trying to push original idea of our creative team because it was awesome  but yeah story didn t have enough gays  enough this kind of people  that kind of  people  ...enough diversity! Im openly gay man and everyone knows that  and I was like why we pushing for gay person in series when it doesnt fit the story  and they are like it will be awesome on twitter. so that explains everything. we artist complain among us all the time  and we are all frustrated with that  but you have bills to pay and eventually you stop to care because you cant fight the system  Imean you can but its so draining and you stress yourself for something that doesnt change anything at the end. hopefully things will change and art will left to artists and  creative groups  but at the end it is all about money and secured investment return ... you know people have to pay mortgages. thats why fan based projects are always the best  but again they never get finished and reason is real life hits and people figure out that they have to work and make for living.
someone at crystal dynamics has some serious daddy issues  and Im sick of them using tomb raider as their therapy sessions.anyway  the real lara croft has been dead since 1999. the new tomb raider games are not tomb raider  crystal dynamics haven t made one tomb raider game yet. they wont remake the originals or make them compatible with newer hardware  and they re never bringing the original lara back. if they did  they d have to admit that after two decades  they haven t done anything memorable with the franchise and people still prefer core designs 20  year old games and lara. and their pride will never let them do that.
I kind of accept the cd tomb raider games as they have themselves said that it is a prequel trilogy. now if they make another one and lara isn t badass like let s say ada wong  then we have a problem. I think we ve had enough of seeing how lara became lara  now its time to see who is lara for real
I enjoyed the reboot trilogy. didn t grow up with the originals and therefore dont work well with their tank controls
maybe we just have to wait for the current wave of pc bs to die before we get something cool again. it d be worth the wait  compared to what we d likely get in yet another twitter-friendly  lame  reboot.
remake the original trilogy  especially 2 and 3
oh  and ps  shadows sold 8.9 million copies as of 2021  with a production budget of 130 million  so it was hardly a flop  it made at least 3 times its production budget.
uncharted 1 was pretty much a cover-shooter tomb raider legend with a more polished narrative. if youreplay trl and u1 in your head  you ll find many similarities.
@point man  not so much in gameplay  but yeah  I see that. I still like both  I just think the comparisons that were drawn weren t as close a match as people were trying to claim back then.
anniversary was the closest we got to a tomb raider game from crystal.
thanks for watching expect more uploads soon you ve been selected as a winnerquickly send a direct me above to acknowledge your prize
inferior than uncharted  nah mate. uncharted puzzles are mostly garbage compared to the tomb raider reboot series. tomb raider is way more darker especially the first game being way more mature  gory  watching lara go through hell  etc  being on pc gives the aiming of weapons way better accuracy than any uncharted game on console  being able to craft bombs  being more exploration focused and feeling like more of a game than a movie in comparison to uncharted make it better for me hands down.
maybe its me  I dont need cutscenes or movies during my games. having a cutscene after a major part  maybe. every mission or during missions... no. I want to earn it.
did you know theres naked ladies in tomb raider ii
I would love to see lara  return to her roots but the truth is lara croft is not the it girl of gaming anymore  there are more female protagonists now then was 20 years ago she will have to compete against aloy from  playstation  bayonetta  from nintendo  and senua from xbox  and so many others in resent years  also im not sure if it will every return to the classic games  of old also for the game awards can we get toby guard a lifetime achievement  award he walked away from millions and has life a quite life ever since.
when do u plan on going live on twitch again
I feel this video waste too much time giving too much love to the original series  let me explain why. is just very easy to see that tomb raider lost its novelty on the 5th installment  then they tried to change the art style while continuing to be faithful to the original series with angel of darkness with no success  tomb raider legend revives the series understanding the necessary changes making the game more modern and cheeky  it had the tones of female led action films of the time back in 2006 with angelina jolie in mind. then it did extremely poorly again going back to the original stuff and it wasn t until the new reboot that the game was truly successful again selling 14 million  11.8 million and then 8 million respectively on each entry  selling way more than what the original content did. tomb raider has been in constant change to be in synch with what gamers crave at the moment.
tomb raider trilogy remake was God awful. it was a poor rip off of uncharted  level wise. everything was worse. lara s character was boring  her support cast of one was boring  she had lousy dialogue  the levels straight up ripped off ones from uncharted  but not as well. she was denied her trademark twin guns  except for one fight  and fobbed off with a bow. further more  in a game called tomb raider... tombs were... wait for it.. .optional!!! thats right  who wants to clutter up a game called tomb raider with tombs    that would be crazy  right  instead let s rip off nathan drake  but not have the same great dialogue  entertaining side characters  no love interest  no fun  no nothing. just awful.
a comment for the algorithm .
not putting that much faith into embracer group  atleast when it comes to future of tomb raider.their ceo said that crystal dynamics would have a great deal of autonomy under embracer  which might necessarily not be a good thing if they re still in their anti-classic lara phase  with no authority telling them to drop it.just look at how laughable the saints row reboot looks like  another franchise owned by embracer.
hey good morning and good afternoon melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that I do agree with you that the company who makes tomb raider video games need to make another tomb raider video game or it will just fall apart and every people including you and me and everyone else who love to play tomb raider video games will be disappointed and we will be write up a big long letter to the video game company who makes the tomb raider games to tell the company to please keep making the tomb raider video games so that you and me and everyone else who loves to play tomb raider video games will be happy with them if they continuing to make tomb raider video games  ok melonie. anyway I just want to make a comment on this video and I just want to tell you that I do agree with you that if they dont make a another tomb raider video game then it will just fall apart and you and me and everyone else will be sad and disappointed with the tomb raider video game company  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say that to you bout this video and I just want to tell you that to have a wonderful and great blessed day today at the gym and at home with your pets melonie. anyway have a great day melonie.
dislike.wow  mel. you are very desperate to throw cd under the bus and discredit them for any possible fault of theirs despite the success they had with the series lately. complaining about a game s budget is pure nitpicking. they well made back the budgets for each of those games   you can simply figure that out with a calculator. what I find odd is that youre blaming the new tr games for square losing money when cd hasn t made a new tr game in 6 years and eidos montreal in 4. they recently worked on marvel games that were more expensive which explains the recent losses. blaming that on tomb raider is like blaming republicans for the problems of democrat major cities when they haven t elected a republican for decades.yes  the video games are try to be like the movies. why not  the movies are successful and chances are  there are more people who have watched a tr movie than have played a tr game and they probably want the same experience should they play that game for the first time. nothing wrong with that and I never saw the idea of having less story and less content to be a good thing.I get that you dont find the appeal in making games easier  but at the same time  why should doing simple tasks like making jumps or climbing ledges be a struggle. I admittedly had various problems doing these things in various n64 and gc games when I was younger and I questioned whether or not it was the right way to go  or simply if the character just wasn t registering with the nearby geometry. it can be very stressful for some players. I dont want a new tr game like that if they dont have to go in that direction.sales did not decline. good grief. I am looking at the psn discounts right now and here s what s on sale  tiny tina s wonderlands  fifa  assassin s creed valhalla  sekiro  riders republic  battlefield 2042  deathloop  witcher 3  all the modern farcrys  mk11  the best-selling mk game to date   and so on. that doesnt mean the games are failing to sell  it means the developers are forecasting points in time in which sales slow down so the games are on sale so sales trends continue to do well.I get it  you dont like modern lara  you dont like modern tr. thats fine. but to say  its got to be my way or the highway  when you can still play the older tr games is kinda silly. I dont see any zelda fans today saying  we need link back in his green elf costume and bring back the linear gameplay and op combat.  the series was getting stale and they needed to change something. if the classic tr gameplay and art style was working before  then why didn t the sales reflect that in the mid 2000s
yourealize lara croft is a spinster   single  right
fantastic video  I for one Im waiting for the gay black lara croft reboot.
no one forced her to raid tombs.
lara croft is gone since aod came out. after that it only became worse and worse.
I liked the girls in duke nukem
so what do you do  stop playing any new games  what can any old fan do!
I personally hated her remake design. the og was sexy yes  but she seemed fit and smart compared to her remake.
hey! there you are!
tomb raider didn t lose its novelty  the 5th installment just wasn t nearly as good and aod especially wasn t  a lot in part to burnout from the developers having unrealistic deadlines. had the games continued with the quality of the first 3  things would have turned out differently
exactly that. stop buying the games. if you must  but used copies that they dont profit on. the only way we can get change in the series is when they see the new stuff doesnt sell while the classic stuff would
Imean hasn t it already failed  there was one good tomb raider game after 2. it wasn t 3 or 4 lol.
I wish that they would just hire you as a consultant. no one understands the character and her potential as well as you do.who in the hell wants to play any game where your supposedly heroic character is frightened and vulnerable  thats not what most players are looking for.make lara croft a badass again or just retire the franchise.
@1 02-1 07 and or by people who never heard of  exercise  and  diet  lol
thank the woke movement for that
rosenberg  you say
kickass action heroine is sexist. whiny  narcissistic daddy s girl is progressive. modern feminism is such a joke.
I absolutely detest this notion that lara croft needs to become a heroine. she. never. fucking. has. been. a. hero. period!
nomorereboots gives us remasters of the classic tomb raiders  the rebooted trilogy haven t sold well according to sales figures so whoever said it needs another reboot is as unoriginal as the last of us remake
not played the newer ones but from the clips here they look more like action simulations with lame qte s just do what the game tells you rather than figuring things out with immersive atmospheric exploring
the original lara is cocky and self confident. the new lara has 0 charisma.
just when she gets confident we break her down again  hahahaha how that is so antI feminist I just cant even. fuck crystal dynamics  the lara croft of the 90s to early 2000s is the most interesting and is the only one to me. this new lara does not exist to me.
there trying to help people with disabilities
bot alert!!! there is a bot answering comments pretending to be melonie  saying you won something  dont fall for it!!!!
hI to nephew!
the girl that fights with a bow and arrow now is so weakkkkkkk!!!!!! that is not lara croft. after chronicles! the franchise went to hell.
yeah  yeah  yeah  we get it already! you dont like growth in a character. the original origin story didn t give her growth. she was just adult lara croft in  kid lara croft body.your complaint is old and tired.
going to have to disagree. the rebooted trilogy weren t good games. they were boring. no charm to them  just moving from set piece to set piece doing the exact same stuff.
gone forever  please
okay here me out though  what if we add zombies
well  rise of the tomb raider technically had zombies lol.
it would be great if these constant reboots of movies and games would stop . everything remade is hot woke garbage. just leave the past back there where it belongs.
stop remaking games. remaster the old ones and we are fine.we dont need uncharted raider.
first
tomb raider is already dead. nobody cares anymore other than what s left of the hardcore fanbase. core design and eidos ran it into the ground and its been on life support since the early 00 s.pull the plug  its over.
or make something new.since culture is under attack  creativity is dead for the moment.
please.tomb raider will always be vastly superior than uncharted.lara is a better character with better motivations than just having luck.her story is better  her tech is better  she s smarter and just has more history than uncharted ever will.
hooray!!!
naughty dog designed each uncharted game with purpose and intent  watch cutscene  climb walls  shoot stuff.in contrast  save a couple of areas from the 2013 game  every gameplay aspect of survivor tomb raider is filler and an afterthought.
@point man  yeah thats the problem. uncharted felt like nothing but an extended cutscene. it felt boring and forced in the end. I wanted to play not watch endless cutscene and the gameplay was mediocre running and shooting most of the time. sure the graphics were killer but thats all it had and rise of the tomb raider did it much better I thought.tomb raider 2013 and rise of the tomb raider are still better than any uncharted.
