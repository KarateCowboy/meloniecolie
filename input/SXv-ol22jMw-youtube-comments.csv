Im not white and I have zero problem with this. a lot of ff games have plenty of characters of other ethnicities. also for me  I primarily care about the quality of the story and game play.
my love for the ninja turtles wasn t lessened by the fact that I wasn t a turtle myself  or a ninja for that matter. I tried blending into the shadows at a party once  and they just said  get this guy a drink  he clearly needs one   okay so the last part isn t true  they offered me 5 drinks cause I was clearly bored.
there is room for stories based around european people thats the core of it. sjws couldn t agree less
your point on ghost of tsushima is spot on. the woke crowd hated it. japanese scholars and nationals commended the game because of its extreme accuracy and respect shown to the culture and time period. easily one of the best single-player experiences in a hot minute. the only people offended by these things are those who choose to be.
yes we are getting sick of  oh everyone has to be represented.  we just want good  fun stories  and fun games. really enjoyed the video melonie. I hope you have fun today. and enjoy your time with your family. take care melonie.
japanese  we want to be historically accurate and respectful of cultural medieval europeeuropeans  makes the queen and other  historical figures blackwhat a world we live in.
I think what s most telling about these kind of complaints  is that they dont realize they re just broadcasting how shallow and bigoted they themselves are.if you must have a character thats the same color of skin gender sexuality as you  youre literally just saying you cant see past said characteristics to empathize with their humanity. which is literally the definition of bigotry.is representation in media good  yes. but people s inability to connect with others that dont fit the exact criteria they themselves are is not a creator s problem   its the consumer s personal failings.
yoshida is amazing and I cant wait to see what he has in store for us with that game.
when I was in art school I had a white classmate who was demeaning himself for having not written a story with a black female main character yet  and was rushing to come up with one to quickly rectify that. this is what creators are stressing about these days. they re more concerned about not being inclusive enough than they are about writing good stories.
I love how the japanese are so polite when they tell the woke to fuck off.
saying the characters lack diversity because they all come from the same region of medieval europe  is an insult to the writers.  we cant even play this game yet  I guarantee there will be a diverse cast of characters - this is a final fantasy game!  saying thatskin tone is the only qualifier for diversity is completely racist.  all people have unique qualities  and through the story I am sure we will learn who these characters are.  the response from square-enix was very well said  and I look forward to playing the game.
the best part is naokI yoshida has so much power at sqenix they cant tell him to shove diversity in the game even if they want to. he didn t just save ff14  he turned it into a God-tier profit machine. nobody of any consequence is gonna challenge him on this.
I actually do go watch movies like black panther to see myself in it  but the thing is I dont need t challa to have my skin color to see my self in him  or even my gender  I can connect with female protagonists just the same . its the thought process  the honor  the strong character hallmarks that I admire and aspire to and want to see in myself as well as I emulate their strengths. none of that requires us to have the same pigmentation
I felt like it was a mega loaded and disrespectful question to yoshI p by ign. his team has engineered tons of great characters  of all colors and shapes. ign just wanted a  gotcha  moment to stir up some fake controversy. if I was se  I d blacklist them from further interviews and give them to more deserving outlets that will actually report topics people give a shit about.
may end up being disappointing to some  - yeah  the 0.5  of vocal consumers who are also activists. pretty sure the vast majority of people of all colors dont care. the game characters could be purple  we just want a good final fantasy game. personally  I think it would be cool if a company produced a game where you could choose the skin color of the npc characters  not just your own   or a set of sliders that determine a random percentage. pretty sure the ue5 engine could be made to do that.
the sad part is  he had the answer prepared knowing western media would ask that type of question.
diversity is fine if it fits the setting. nothing wrong with a medieval european setting being mostly european. great video melonie  and I hope you have a wonderful day.
what the idiots ignore is that to japan  european historical settings are exotic in the same vein that we find japanese settings exotic.
ya got brain cells  use  em. like 80   or more  of the industry needs to hear this until itsinks in.
Ive been a fan of final fantasy since the first one I play them for there story  unique characters and game play. Im glad naokI yoshida said what he said cause thats how the games and everything else should be made.
I am the brownest of brown boys if you look at the dictionary and go to indian and you will see a picture of meI do not care on this I am hyped for a ff game cause it can have good combat and actually feels like a fantasyalso garuda has me questioning things
@affan sami  in my country dictionaries dont have pictures but I ll take your word for it.
@affan sami  awesome bro. Ive played many great games with characters of all backgrounds. if its a fun game  who cares about this other stuff.
as a black person and forever videogamer I agree 200
@david fontdevila robles  mostly white woman with pink hair are offended on the behalf of black people. all that matters is the setting of the game and the artistic direction  Imean I cant imagine gta sa without cj
@david fontdevila robles  exactly! there are so many great games with great characters of many ethnic backgrounds  black  white  latino  arabic  asian etc. if it is a great game story thatstuff is irrelevant.
a fine gentleman of culture.
you also normal then
some of us played games like super mario bros being little 1 foot italian guys running around I seriously doubt I d even notice what race the character was after a few seconds these npc s are so pathetic.
lol
good news  friend!  in today s clown world you can now identify as a ninja turtle and the left will tell you that you are stunning and brave.
but according to woke politics  you can only appreciate something if you are represented.therefore you shouldn t be watching ninja turtles  as its clearly not been made for you.when it is a financial disaster  after all the non-turtle audience are driven away... its also your fault.woke logic at its finest.
this is an excellent point because itshows how silly these people are. Imean they that women characters should only be written by women because of experiences yet there not all of them can write good characters. same with men.
tmnt was cool especially when you are young remember paraplegic terrapin lives matter. those four shellshockers  survived a near fatal hate crime by shredder when he tried to turn them into his lunch or dinner ala turtle stew.   remember pt lives matter now the pt turtles those once rockin radical rebels now pt former ninja   turtles have ptsd and when they expire pt barnum s heir  will  collect the remains and put them on display. and shredder after never getting a chance to dine on turtle stew because the turtles died in the sewers rather than his lair. shredder out of depression and not dining on mutant turtles and not getting enough pussy shredder hung himself and left a note on his body saying  f you krang lol.
well I identify as a turtle. and I found turtles kind of offensive myself.
Ive always identified as a super genius with a whiny voice stuck in a giant s body. my pronoun is krang.
glad to see more people standing up to speciesist practices in hollywood.
that anecdote got a few laughs out of me.  try it again  next party you go to!
updated for a modern audience
@kingtairun  exactly! been playing games my whole life and I never remember once thinking  oh if this guy was black I d like this game more  . even more I dnt even think I ever paid attention to the characters  races colors just if they were cool or not and if the game was fun or not  Imean I am obssed with nintendo games where I always use luigI and we cant be more different  this is just annoying for us players cuz devs be chaging stuff to meet a quota that real gamers  the ones buying the product  dnt give a single f u c k.
@david fontdevila robles  Goddamn right! I find myself playing older games more often than new ones  for 1 they re focused on the gameplay or the story more often than trying to look flashy for the sake of being flashy  thatshould just be a bonus. but there s no bloody real world politics in them! and they aren t trying to represent anybody in particular. there s no point in my life where me and my mates have ever questioned the nationality of skin color or clothing choice of whoever s on the screen at any one time.I will never believe that gamers and games are somehow discriminating against  insert group here . because in half my lifetime gaming went from a group of  nerds  in school  because it was less than common to play games. to nearly everybody does it now! more and more people are included in the culture  if people dont like one type of game  there s a million and a half more that you might. and outside of toxic competitive shit talk  nothing will discriminate against people for gaming anymore. let alone the games themselves. just because you aren t represented doesnt somehow make the game discriminative. these people are deluded. the only time I think of shit like this is when  they  point it out and the funniest part is... more often than not  journo s like this and their bandwagon of complainers  aren t gamers.
@david fontdevila robles  same here brother  same here
@c j  if the characters are really well written then they dont even have to look like you to you empathize with them
@marua reys  agreed. and I hate to say it  but if someone cant empathize or identify with a character just because their skin color is different  that person is the real racist. thats why I dont like this idea of needing to have  representation
@daunt  I tend to agree. only they keep mentioning color over and over when the idea is to forget about it because it doesnt matter
@daunt  no actual gamers care about this kinda thing. we just want to play and have fun.
plus there s talking cats and dogs in ff lol you cant get more diverse than that.
as a black man  I wonder why I have white skin  a white name  and no desire to commit violent crimes.
as a black person  these japanese games have never had good diversity when it comes to protagonists. there s always a white protagonist with some kind of magic  a sword  or both. you might see a black supporting character somewhere but I dont really blame the people for wanting change. just because youre comfortable with the status quo doesnt mean other people shouldn t be.
barret wallace has entered the chat
@randy fulford  barrett was a great surrogate father to marlene  just a great example of what a man should be. ff has done a fantastic job representing different races well.
@c j  I love barret so much!  minI gun arm for life!!!  takes zero bullshit from anyone
@randy fulford  I loved his gun arm! especially because for a long time he was the only ranged attack member of the party until you get yuffie and vincent.
how could you   dont you know. a genderless sorta woman  with no features over powered mixed race character. is the best!  and only type of character now. always   weren t games fun
@robint h-d.e.s  as greta would say   how dare you !
@c j  how dare hahah
easy  bro  you keep spittin  sensible logic like that and you ll get cancelled.
its mostly other white people complaining about it
no it doesnt. Ive played it all my life  you can be okay with something but dont lie brother.
@david fontdevila robles  let s be honest with ourselves  most ff characters look like japanese people with the complexion and hair color of caucasian people.
@sub if you are against antifa and blm  doesnt mario have italian fans though
@felonious floyd  make my own shit  youre already here.
@kinky kink  Im your own shit  that doesnt even make sense.
@felonious floyd  it went over your head
@felonious floyd  way to put your lack of education.
Imean tidus looks like half asian meg ryan and its still a cool game who cares what the main character s color is
@kinky kink  where did I put my lack of education  maybe if youre going to try to insult somebody  you should learn to speak english first.you know  that language my forefathers invented so we could communicate beyond grunts and hand gestures.youre welcome.
youre not wrong. there are plenty of stories where thats the core and they expand from there. ff games are always about exploration most times. and they have other races that are mostly ambiguous  but still have a name.
I always find these people odd. Imean if I was watching a film based on japanese history  I would not be desperate to see someone who looks like me whereas an sjw would expect to be represented. is it because of narcissism  when these people write characters  they are usually a copy and cut of themselves. lovecraft did it but he did not make the character invincible or better than everyone.
@nemesis the slasher   no  its simply anti-white and anti-western. ofc sjws would never complain about a japanese movie consisting of only japanese people  or a bollywood film casting only indians  because neither of this group is white  or western . its not actually inconsistent. its just racist.
and they dont have to buy it. but the fact they aren t bending to these loud idiots is enough to make me preorder. which I havent done since assassin s creed 2
@marshulartz  ff should be about whatever sq wants. if they have to do some diversity checklist  I wont get ffxv 4 bros I like and the endearing anime they released for free.
@kaimargonar1000  yeah I agree. I wouldn t want to hear about them checking off a list either. if they make ambiguous people who have different skin tones thats fine too. a person or company are able to create what they want  but now days you will have  fans  question the games they are making.
@illuminated perspectives  noctis n friends is white
@illuminated perspectives  why is there no ainu representation in persona 5  okinawan or osaka people  or people speaking with kansaI dialect  do atlus hate minority  why is nobody concern about this
got quickly bowed down in the dlc though. female final boss  female boss on the protagonist s side. surprised they didn t have a boat from africa show up where they all spoke japanese.
I really loved the base game. such a graphically amazing game.
none of these people even play the games they are criticizing. why does anyone even listen to these people
@jonathan devereaux  a female final boss  thats your issue  dude  suckerpunch did that in infamous second son. how is that a problem  as long as she s a well written character with purpose  then who cares
@ink chariot  dont exaggerate.
@jonathan devereaux  what s the problem with a female boss as long as she is representative of the circumstances of the time and era the game happens then it is fine. throughout history there were many evil and murderous women  as well as leaders and so on. of course there weren t as many or as easily to come by men  but they still existed.
@jonathan devereaux   its also possible they just chose to do that. because they liked the idea.
@jonathan devereaux   uhhhh a female final boss is not  woke  lmfao...if a boat from africa showed up then I d agree.
@jonathan devereaux I understand what youre getting at here
I love the chad answer!!!
dont worry squenix made an equity alternative with that crt ff called  forspoken .
I just want games without denuvo
the word  representation  makes me cringe when hearing it now. its literally a  eye roll  reflex. and it doesnt even have to be used in a bad way.
@marshulartz  exactly the same for me with the phrase   strong and independent.
@raskolnikov
thats the truth story is what matters not characters skin color
also  in europe and asia there still countries that are 99  one race  its just being accurate  I dont see any problem with that  if someone sees just dont consume it  dont try to change others ppl work
@marshulartz  kind of  fruity not gonna lie. why do you only want to look at white and muscular men
did europeans do that  or was it an american production
@       I would say americans first  but both are pretty much doing that to some extent.
@       both are guilty. for an example of a uk production see  anne boleyn
@toxicfume  this nonsense certainly is spreading  even through asia  but I would say most continental europe  or the non english speaking europe looks at this in disdain  it really is pretty much the english speaking countries that are obsessed with this  or well a small portion of their populance  mostly media  but even then it is way toned down even in uk compared to the usa. I live in europe for the past 12 years  a slavic country  but I  we  travel a lot and pretty much everyone in my circle of friends and acquaintances  here  thinks americans have lost their mind  slovenes  croats  italians  austrians  germans  dutch. as said while this nonsense is spreading the world  it is still pretty much ignored  laughed at  or completely refuted.
@valentin vas  what dumbfounded me more at the time is that people were extremely critical of anyone in the us holding non-diverse  national or isolationist views and yet celebrated the introduction of the mythical city of wakanda -- a black homogeneous national isolationist city-state.
@danny
thats americans  not europeans. I find it hilarious when americans try to school us on our own history  demographic and culture lol.
we re fine with diversity but dont blackwash pre-existing white or caucasian characters. solution is make a sequel for ffxvI where clive meets and fights against poc dominants. clive becomes a conquistador or explorer  and he goes to an undiscovered continent and meets poc characters.
those are not europeans  they re js.
@og123  its the very same js who own both the us and uk media.
@og123 as mentioned earlier  while it is american productions who are primary examples  english productions are also guilty of this.also while many may be american productions they are still acted out by a number of employed british or other europeans or of european descent  not including those who simply employ an accent .and lastly  whether americans like to admit it or not their own ancestral history began and resides in europe.so while my statement is a generalisation  it is still accurate.
@timmytimmy mit yep -- instead of telling a compelling story based in black history or black mythology  they d rather be unoriginal and just blackwash prexisting european tales.or in the case of the woman king  simply rewrite history...
re-writing history and soon Jesus will be a trans women who fought hitler.
as a european im pretty sure america did it first after that european film producers started to follow one after an other slowly.
@minsteral of maddnes who is the bigger fool  the one who leads or the one who follows
@       anglos. americans started it then brits are fully on-board
@Lord shaitan   id have to say both.
@Lord shaitan  europe is a continent  it is so culturally  ehtnically and linguistic diverse that it is actually quite sad you want to group a whole continent with the views of one country - england. besides  it is primarily american based and american begun  the few british people you see going for this type of  for a modern audience  distortion of history and media are those whose livelihood depends on an audience aka british celebs. british celebs know that their content being in english can reach further than the uk and spread to america and australia. it is  as you can say  an extension of pleasing the masses or what is in vogue for money. however  if you do live in england you will find the large majority of people do not agree with such views and when it comes to the rest of the european countries  whose native and mother language is not english  they find this type of mentality hilarious and ridiculous. we europeans are  in the vast majority  very proud of our own heritage and history.
@maomi  wow  talk about an inability to take a joke.one  the joke is more contextually relevant if I say europeans as opposed to americans or english or similar ilk because the discussion point was regarding medieval european culture.two  noone disagrees that europe is a massive and culturally diverse place  and that the english are but a small part of it  but they are still are europeans  so my statement is accurate. three  I didn t say all europeans. Imeant to  and did  only imply that there are europeans who are changing the ethnicity of historical figures from their cultural history  which is a true statement.four  it is irrelevant to my statement who started it  or continue to be a major factor in it  regardless of their reasons  but it is still true that europeans  whether they be the actual studios producing it  or the actors involved in it  are involved and carrying out this practice.five  it is clearly understood that it is an extremely vocal minority who are pushing this nonsense but unfortunately they are punching well above their weight and shifting culture against the wishes of the majority because they would rather be left alone to live out their best lives -- live and let live.so yes  americans are indeed the most to blame for this infection and are continuing to propagate it  but it is just as true that europeans  ie english  and australians  are starting to become just as bad.
white guilt has that affect.
boom. well said!
I think the whole idea of representation is flawed because it always centers on representing members of the audience. because it also needs to be esg friendly  those characters tend to be offensive to regular non-political people and inoffensive to the politically possessed hr department. thats why apex features a fat chick who supposedly grew up on the wild but also talks like she uses a phone all day  but it would never feature a fat drug abuser who sees conspiracies everywhere like tim dillon. the game also has an android that mocks a child he orphaned but respects everyone s race and gender identity. conflict is inherent to diversity  which is why it always sucks in corporate games. this milquetoast representation isn t what the audience wants a lot of the time  and catering to the ones who want that results in npcs in a warzone who are indistinguishable from twitch interns. the idea should be representation of what the audience wants or doesnt know what they want. sometimes it might reflect the audience sometimes it might reflect a culture that the audience didnt know about  and sometimes it might involve hate speech traded between characters from incompatible cultures  but it will never reflect an idiot who spends all day on twitter
if a character is well written you can sympathize with the char. doesnt matter what walk of life the char is from and what setting as long as its true to its sources and everything makes sense in the world-building lore. I like the film kwaidan the film  orochI and the film asura those are live action japanese mythology films. I am not japanese nor asian. though I can enjoy them because the characters are likeable and the actors and actresses give admirable and charismatic performances.
they also expect the character to have the exact same personality. have you ever seen these people write stories  they self-insert themselves as a main character who can do no wrong. there is nothing wrong with basing characters on yourself or family members  but these people tend to do it for narcissist reasoning.
very well said. ironically they are only feeding the mindset they claim to criticize  all the while being able to look human tragedy dead in the eye without referring to some sort of  justice
quick question are you white btw because I care about representation because its more so seeing a character that looks different than everyone else vs having everyone be white and look like the exact same characters we ve gotten before already like a million times over
@danny  why should it matter if he or she is white  the creators are japanese. they decided that the characters are european based. the japanese seem to have a thing for european lore and history. the japanese are really bothered about adding a character of every skin colour. they do have plenty of characters from around the globe and such but not in the rush to be the most diverse. they do not get a badge for doing it. my point is that the japanese manga anime creators are almost always going beyond their own skin colour as their characters have things that draw us to them without looking the same. I was watching anime based on the victorian era called emma  a victorian romance. the lady behind it had most of the characters as english and some german and the people was white. the only non-white character was an indian prince who was sort of a main character. she did the characters as she saw fit  she did not have a massive diverse cast in the middle of vortorian london like a lot of american english creators in the current year would do to avoid looking racist. the fact that the japanese can do a more faithful look at english history than the english is crazy. a film set in rural wales had backlash over not having enough diversity I hope japan never gets like that. another thing I like about the japanese is that they do not seem begrudging of countries for their part in jumping the bomb on innocents and making them suffer through the affects in generational torment as it passes through the children. some people like a certsin religion will never move past it and act like a victim.
@danny  you will have a game to play from square enix soon  forspoken  you guys better buy it otherwise we dont wanna hear it.
I cant wait for ff xvi!
@norman readdis  oh God  wish I never saw that. thanks.
more concerned with not getting in trouble than doing good work. not a good starting position.
thats a dangerous mindset to have as a creator. I feel bad for him and I hope he grows a spine against these bullies at some point. Im a writer too and the story and quality of the characters are the most important parts of it. I dont want some knucklehead screaming at me for not having loudmouthed lesbians as the main characters. in fact  that would make me not wanna represent them in my work at all. I write the characters as I first see them in my head. I do have a black transwoman character  but Imade her like that because it was the first thing I thought. she has a real personality too and likes fire! no in your face representation nonsense. she s just there.
more stereotypes than ever before  being forced to accommodate others.  I thought this was called cultural appropriation
and once they ve checked the box  they call it a day. they dont think the story needs to be good as long as its diverse and helps represent  oppressed  people. they do it for their own ego savior complex. Im a white writer and I personally would t go out of my way to make a black protagonist  unless it fit in the setting really well.
sadly they re now in the esg system. forspoken  is the poster child of that direction. its a crt ff from squenix.
@norman readdis  yeah  japanese companies are trying to please the west now. capcom has managed to do so in a borderline acceptable manner  but the influence is sadly there.
@mige sama  off topic but worst representation re game has done was that black or african american stars member was eaten by that zombie scientist in the mansion in the start of the game.
@mige sama  yup even namco bandaI had a memo and the sensorship of my hero academia in the western release. people that doesnt know this are going to be shock soon.
@norman readdis  why would they need censorship  what is in there to offend  also  I see no reason for japan to do things differently in countries like england as their stuff is quite big there. I was shocked that jojo manga has no english translation for the manga yet the spanish and french yet the anime has it.japanese films  anime  manga etc are beloved by english speaking people. the ones who complain was never going too purchase the stuff in the first place. I would say japan needs to advertise their stuff a lot more and not just the already popular stuff like dragonball. emma  a victorian romance has characters that fit the location and era. it does not have forced diversity like a lot of shows do. they have prince akim from india but not adding in characters to avoid looking racist. if I did that  I would most likely get backlash over so-called racism. Imean look at game of thrones and the twits who attacked it. nobody should surrender to people who hate just to hate and had no real intention of watching or reading the stuff.
the answer is to block them and never respond
the funny thing is that japanese people worked on it. so  in a way it is diverse as they are focusing on characters that are different to them in culture etc. the japanese do focus a lot on european history and mythology as like the rest of us do with their stuff. sjws would response in nonsense like  cultural appropiation  because they have never appreciated anything in their lives.
I cant wait for ffxvI it will be the greatest final fantasy game ever made.
@norman readdis  project agnI  athia  was killed for forespoken... I was really looking forward to that ever since the first agnaI tech demo.
they need to get him back on xiv  endwalker was bad and definitely showed a lack of his oversight.
@palladiamors  how was it bad
you say that but then I remember what happened to the guy who created final fantasy  saved square is kind of the reason it is around today...
@keiichimorisato98 yup  good thing someone remembers. agnI got blackfaced lolthey repurpose that tech demo that had a potential of a solo game just to pander.
@darkness flame media  youre blind then.
the only diversity I wanna see in ff16 is the platforms it will be on and they have checked that box perfectly
@palladiamors  you clearly didn t play it then.
@norman readdis  it was also supposed to be a final fantasy spin off.
@norman readdis   too bad forspoken is already destined to fail  no one liked it  the marketing for it was cringe and poorly made and the game is suffering in dev hell  hence why it got delayed
@yuukarnstein they aren t done anything good outside their cult classic ip s.avengers bomb  babylon s fall flop  gotg is forgettable. they sold other ips.
@keiichimorisato98 thats typical squenix with their  collab  universes. they re trying ff and nier to make sense but its just  fanservice   nonetheless.
@norman readdis  nah  the ff x neir thing was pure fan service because yoko taro is good friends with yoshida and they wanted to work together on a project.
@keiichimorisato98  time will tell  if it can make money from the consoomers they ll make it  put kh as a pinch pin lmao.
what are you talking about ffxiv is clogged with  diversity  with all sorts of unimaginable woke garbage.
@keiichimorisato98  it was mediocre at best.
yeah  youre right.se already has foreign influence and it is the reason forespoken or whatever and stranger of paradise have those characters  obviously  looks forced  unlike xiiI and viI  for instance .but yeah  yoshida is untouchable.
they will probably diversify ffxvI in a sequel. since this is made by the people who gave us ffxiv which also a diverse game.
@norman readdis  and its gonna flop
@mige sama strangers paradise is like spirits within where they rely in the design to be leaning in western taste just like the contrast of gestalt and replicant in nier. also strangers paradise is just a cash grab prequel. they literally milking all the titles for nostalgia bait.
@mickey mickey  squenix is the mcu of the gaming industry so Im sure it ll sell some because of  get existed on the next squenix content  conssomers.
@norman readdis  I dont know they ve had plenty of flops before  especially their western ips.
@palladiamors  how was endwalker bad  it tied up just about all loose ends and questions raised from arr-stormblood and the story against nihilism existentialism was pretty well delivered.
then why didn t he do anything when the ff7 remake needlessly changed cloud strife s thoughts regarding the crossdressing bit  the dance number  andrea s entire character and honey bee inn  those weren t even a part of the original  yet they re here  and people gobbled that hot  pandering mess up. was he even involved in the project or was it a different crew or department that did this
@norman readdis  they re everywhere.
@something who s everywhere
@norman readdis  the progressives.
@something  oh yeah altho japan is fairly progressive ever since  they re just going on the western lefties direction nowadays because they re now a self proclaimed esg company. so thats a massive red flag.
@alexander  ff14 is diverse because the characters in it are avatars representing the actual playerbase. ff16  is a set character with his own world and backstory.
@norman readdis  babylons fall was a perfectly fine game too. shame it had that ugly painted canvas filter covering all of it on top of it being multi-player focused romp.
@raifseverence  its quite forgettable imho. also too much live service in one company saturates the fanbase.
@damian cross   its kind of stupid for that guy to go all  ree diversity  about a massive fantasy mmo....imagine how boring eorzea would be without all of its interesting races with unique lore to pick your avatar from
@palladiamors  Imean endwalker has issues but I wouldn t go that far.
@alexander  which is all the more ironic thatsjws are calling yoshi-p racist. oh yes  a man that leads the most pro-culturalism game in the genre has to be a racist. surely.
@keiichimorisato98  I googled a bit of that name and I find footage of the forspoken
@filthycasual  not surprised  project athia turned into forespoken  the world of the game is called athia. but Ive been following this project since 2012  back when the agnI philosophy tech demo released. we were never given any footage or much information on the project other than it was in development.
this. I grew up as a latino and a film buff. if I only watched films that featured people of my ethnicity race  I d be severely limiting the amount of movies I could watch. I like robert rodriguez  not because we share the same ethnic traits  but because he s an awesome director  well  he is half of the time anyway...
some people cant see themselves in other characters if they dont look like them. shallow  shallow people.
@disc one final boss  even if they have your skin color  they may not have your hair or eye color. is that a requirement too  what about height  weight and timber of voice  those people are cringe lol.
@scott adams  yeah  where is the line for them
likewise. I prefer the relationship of neurology over biology.
exactly  and I can also enjoy black panther even if there is no white people in it  and I also dont feel the need to demand white people be present in a fantasy story about people based in a fictional africa.
that was a lame bro. marvel movies are for children.
se has lgb t and an ethic counsel  no chance
@fried chicken  and the game is developed by creative business unit 3  not se. yoshi-p has more success within the company because of how he saved se from their utter failures through ffxiv. he has been given full latitude to run his projects as he sees fit. as a board member in se and the lead of cpu3  he isn t beholden to the idiocy se has gone through. its why they recently announced ffxiv is their flag ship  which is yoshi-p s title .
as brown man  ive never had an issue connecting with characters of any ethnicity or gender. I cried when arthur morgan  white man  died  glados  a robot with a feminine voice  still gives me the feels  gta san andreas  most main characters are black  is still my favourite gta. I find it pretty ridiculous that people need someone who looks exactly like them to be inspired by them or connect to their stories.
diversity is all well and good when it makes sense within the story time location. forced diversity takes away from the believability and immersion. im not sure why they do not get this. a persons race does not matter  their character as a person matters.
I thought the same
no-one ever accused the woke of being unpredictable.
the correct answer is to ignore them.
mostly european  you mean entirely european
@vladolf putler  one could perhaps get a different impression in some cities today  but the orient actually does not belong to europe.
they could make a sequel for ffxvI where clive is a conquistador or explorer who meets poc characters in a hidden continent and he has to save them from a predicament  and those new poc characters new dominants or new eikons.
@norman readdis  that one farmville like game is also woke. it has a the non binary bs in it.
@frumentarii you mean harvestella  yep they did lmao.altho making characters effeminate is always square since their box art but its just a matter of time they go full pronoun lmao.
I think they should be fired and replaced with people who are capable of doing their jobs.
@rambleon07  couldn t agree more
just responding to the critics is giving them an importance  they dont deserve.
a lot of my favourite game characters are white  leon kennedy  gabe logan  yennefer  cloud  sepiroth  kolin  nina willams among a few. Im brown and it doesnt affect my ability to enjoy a game. what are these ppl gonna do  ree and call me names
I actually enjoy cases of not being represented at all. one of the best things about fiction is being able to experience the life stories of people that are completely different than me in almost every way. exploring histories  cultures  politics  religions  races  etc that are nothing like me or my own is great.
final fantasy was always eurocentric though asian eyes.  yet they probably love avatar the last airbender which was oriental-centric through western eyes
mel mel when we were younger we loved games that we personally thought looked amazing. when we didn t like a game we just didn t play it and would tell our friends  ehh I dont think that looks cool .playing games was about how they looked to us graphics and gameplay wise. then when we got our hands on it we found the story was really cool. the dumb thing about today is a rise in people becoming  gamers  suddenly meant complaining that this game is  too hard  or  they over sexualized the characters  mainly women characters  and they nitpick at every little thing. a lot of games of old would ve been made more pc today of course because of all the buzz terms going around and people being afraid of being cancelled. Im glad there wanting to revisit ip s but not for a reimagined version  . anyway thanks for the great video!
Im mexican and I really do not care about being represented or whatever. my favorite game is shenmue and when I was little I felt that ryo was very relatable to me regardless of what race he is. I love video games for being fun and for having great stories to be told!
I personally thought this was a good interview with good questions and answers. goes a little bit into the field and exploration side of things which trailers haven t focused on yet  mainly that there will be optional side stories you can do to learn more about the world and characters  and there ll also be elite marks which Im guessing could be rare stronger monsters to take down.I also liked the question about the what elements tied all final fantasy games together and the answer kojI fox gave about emotion. the ffv example he cited was great. all in all Im looking forward immensely to ffxvi.
your honour I confess as someone of indian origin. chloe frazer couldn t get me to support naughty dog nor have I ever played as dhalsim or symmetra as I usually choose ken and ashe. I plead guilty!gets thrown in internalized reee cism jail
Im glad that yoshida has both a good track record in terms of games and a high position in square enix since they just let him do his thing and dont question it and if they do he fights tooth and nail for his vision which is good especially since square enix has gotten somewhat woke as of late cuz with they re latest release which was harvestella on pc and switch they kept on promoting relentlessly on how there was a non binary gender option for the game
this just proves how doomed media mediums are. tragic stuff. thanks for the video and info melonie!
imagine playing tetris in 2022   how I am going to identify with these items  !
respect  I figured yoshI would give this type of answer. really nice guy but doesnt waver when it comes to his vision. also yeah wished more people were like yoko taro  dude that was over nier automata    he creates what he wants and thats it. still remember yoko hearing of the 2b butt  controversy   man straight up said he enjoyed it and to send him all of the lewd art of 2b in a zip file
we used to tell universal stories about things that happen to everyone. loss  love   surrender  war  search for meaning  finding purpose  romance  and more. now its just about current politics  poor allegories  and identity. and stories are suffering because of it.  I liked it in the initial wake of metoo and time up when we were getting these awesome stories from black  hispanic  gay and trans creators  given money and opportunity to their films  and takes on things. initially the boom was good. then the quality began to suffer  the stories began to become some preachy idiocy where characters monologue to the audience  for no other purpose than the writer wants to tell people what s right and wrong and what to believe. and everything started to fall apart. we need inclusion in filmmaking  as in  we need studios to set aside funds for films from other voices  actual good voices that will make money  and test different audiences. for a long time  hollywood thought black movies didn t make money. then tyler perry proved them completely wrong. the same goes with any and all ethnicities. the type of inclusion would be good. whatever tokenization bullshit happening now  is just that bullshit.
lotr can never be good without aragorn being a non binary latinx  legolas being a gay poc  gimlI being bI  disabled and asian  frodo being a asexual woman of color  pippin and merry being native american and indian in the first gay sibling romance evertm  gandalf being pansexual gender fluid and sarumans baby momma  boromir being a eskimo deeply in love with how good at everything frodesha is and unable to stop his attraction to her unparalleled beauty and twerking he witnessed until he dies blocking arrows for her  and last but not least sam  a trans white person who will talk about how much their ancestors oppressed frodeshas ancestors  and even if they got stabbed 1776 times by shelob itstill would not be enough to even be able to properly kiss frodeshas clean shaven  post salon feet  s  this post besides the sanctified s has been translated from the vilest of texts found in mordor
thank fuck yoshida is as based as he is  rebuttles accusations with the right answers. hopefully itstays that way
if youre in ff14 you know how great and kind yoshI p is. all these people getting mad and calling him racist is truly mind boggling to me. the devs wanted isolated medeival vibes to this new one. nuff said.
well said melanie. I first saw this story covered by vera dark. I left several comments on her video. but yes this awesome. noakI yoshida is awesome   he is a true chad .
today is my birthday and in the 45 years I have lived  I have yet to see myself represented in any mainstream or huge game franchise. Im filipino and I dont care to be represented because my mom raised me to judge by content and character and not by the surface.my favorite genre of games is fighters and Ive been playing sf for decades and not once say to myself I dont want to play this because no one looks like me.there will never be a game where someone looks like me because Im one of a kind mwahaha custom creations do not count
Ive adored final fantasy for as far back as I can remember! I hope this can deliver for the fan base
hey  kids  remember when we were more concerned about the depth of characters than their ethnicity
exactly  vids like this add fuel to the fire. we should just ignore them and let them shout their rage into the wind....
yes.
cloud is a major hottie lol
yes. they will.
cloud is japanese. sepiroth is...something...
it isn t eurocentric they were making art about europeans race and culture and fantasy
@dalia  so eurocentric.
Im not white but I love ffxvI and Im excited for clive rosfield!
I just beat shenmue for the first time. loved it!!!
@fight ostin fight  awesome! glad you liked it. the second one is great too.
or hidekI kamiya explaining why bayonetta is a 7 foot tall  glasses wearing sex pot and his  do you eat shit   tweet
did you get alex terrible s mask anywho. the japanese dont play identity politics. Im confident it will stay that way
@butcher.cs oh I beg to differ since the japanese industry entered esg system and let me show you their crt ff called  forspoken .
@butcher.cs  yeah I got one from his store  d
@norman readdis  sure its under ses wings  but I dont know if yoshI is involved with forspoken at all.
@leonidas tri  forspoken is made by luminous studios  ff15  luminous engine   which since the restructuring of se is no longer part of the company itself  but just a subsidiary.se s internal groups are called creative business unit  1-4  and yoshida is the director of cbu3. president of luminous studios is kitase  who is also director of cbu1  ff13  ff15  ff7r .
@norman readdis  the hilarious thing is that forspoken is likely gonna flop in sales  its already been delayed twice and there s no buzz for that game whatsoever
@norman readdis  ah.. thats a shame realy  I just wanna play games with interessting   good written characters and not forced diversity. a real bummer tbh.
@hector really hope it will to send a message to japan thats going woke nowadays to stop doing what they think they re doing.saw the playstation trailer and the comments are full of oblivious optimists.
@leonidas tri  its probably a good game in terms of gameplay as long as you can stomach the intersectionalism tho.oh and river city girl 2 also went there.
@norman readdis  never heard of that  river city girl  Ive just grown rly tired of itsince it gets shoved down in our throats each and every time in every media  cant even escape in games from  the modern audience  its quite frustrating
@leonidas tri river city girls 2 made that chick from double dragon a no need no man muscle abby wannabe.
thank God we still have female and male option in the game  unlike wow thatswitched to body type a and b
@nifael  well wow is an western mmo that was being directed by an aI nowadays lol.japan mmo is still not currupted yet specially phantasy star online new genesis.
@hector  what  noooo. but I was looking forward to it because the trailer song was so good
Im surprised he hasn t caved to the diversity crowd on this. he capitulates constantly on ffxiv to nonsense like this.
ff14 is the most diverse ff game out there  and ff16 is made by the same people who made 14
it is funny how they call the japanese videogame creators racist for exploring a different culture. even if your stuff is diverse  they claim you appropriated someone else s culture. I do not get why these people are listened to as they never buy the games and probably never will. why insult your audience just to get a few people not only is it insulting your audience  but it will also lose money.
its hardly isolated. that desert kingdom in the game should at least be ruled and populated by brown or black moorish people. instead  its ruler is a pasty white targaryen-looking dude thats suffering from albinism.
some folks were throwing up that article in a few jrpg groups Im in. majority of us said we just wanna play the damn game.reminds me of when they complain about sakimI s artwork.  overly exaggerated body parts.  Im thinking dang imagine someone telling you how to do your own creations. these crazy times.
japan doesnt even understand that most people complaining on the internet dont know why they are upset in the first place and square enix is sadly being tricked into following their directions.  im black but kain highwind is my favorite character in the series.  its not fair that one race cant like another character that does not match their own.  most jrpgs try their best to accommodate for black players  but its not a deal breaker when it does not happen.  if its a beloved series  we are playing it.  period!
this game is gonna kick ass. devil may cry combat   final fantasy big budget world  Im freaking in.
this isn t going to stop until these producers stop allowing themselves to be bullied by these people. only one is needed with the balls to kick the door right in their face when they come knocking. all the others will start falling in line.
Ive been a final fantasy fan since the original on nes. I have played all of the mainline series to completion   minus the online games   and most of the spin off games. the characters are always highly diverse in attitude  beliefs  characteristics etc. the fact that a story based in european mythology will predominantly feature european looking characters does not take away from the fact that final fantasy is truly one of the most diverse series ever. all these people see is skin color  not the person underneath.
excellent work melanie. keep it up. fight the good fight.
I totally understand where youre coming from but Imust admit that I always thought that the japanese use of european aesthetic is a bit odd. this has never stopped me form enjoying this wonderful series and fandom.
from soft   we think your myth and folklore cool  so we made this.   holds up the soulsborne games sucker punch prod   we think your history is cool  so we made this.   holds up ghost of tsushima squeenix   we think european history and culture are cool  so we made this.   holds up ffxvI  mutual respect and admiration up   fun up and  lo and behold  the usual suspects just hated that and had to stick their oar in.
I actually thought the last final fantasy that basically looked like a 90s boy band adventure almost impossible to get into. but yeah  great story and bestiary. fun yet challenging battles.
when wokeness started I laughed. I thought to myself  these people are insane  pretty entertaining though.  never did I think businesses  politicians and media would actually side and propagate this insanity. now look where we are. the clowns are running the show apparently.
hImelioe just found your channel rsetley and I love how you talk about things youre passionate about we need more people like that aren t afraid to speak their minds about some of dumb things people get upset about like you said not every thing need to be about certain groups of people all  the time just make good or even great story can we please just go back to that ps would love to game with you some time Imostly play rpg but I love allcinde of different games
honestly this happens to every new ff game
I have honestly thought this whole time that everyone in ff games were japanese. like in anime even if the characters are pretty light skin to me most of the time they are still japanese. it wasn t that long ago that people complained that pokemon was trying to white wash one of their few black characters in pokemon when they made brock s skin lighter. then it came out that brock was always japanese because some people in japan have pretty dark skin compared to others.
and I have to say. and I dont care who sees this. you look very beautiful melonie.and you are my absolute favorite content creator.
you have brain cells  use them   go boom  . hahaha love it.
excellent commentary  melonie. I particularly liked the nod to yoko taro at the end. boom!
not liking something because you cant see yourself in itsays more about you then it does the product.
as a writer  I hate the idea of someone else telling me what kind of people I have to include in my stories. Im not writing for other people s ego but because I love the process of creating! and diversity isn t something you forcefully implement in any story  book  movie  or game  it needs to come organically. it has to make sense in the story characters world etc.
you got brain cells  use em thats a tall order for some lmfao
well said melonie...
@norman readdis  ffxvi-2 clive rosfield becomes an explorer and searches for the secrets of the eikons  he explores a continent full of poc dominants and meets and fights poc characters.
@timmytimmy mit  lolbe exited on the next squenix content.let s see where esg and tencent partnership will them them in the future.squenix always love a token poc but I never see them go the forespoken path. they repurpose agnI s prophecy for that pandering.
for example  whI people never hated on barret.
if they knew anything about ff they d know barrett is a fan favorite.
@norman readdis  and none of the people screeching about diversity will even play it
@grimm metals esg dont care who played it. the money does not come to the players that may buy them but from the people with the narrative it pushes.
I will play ffxvI regardless of the hate it gets  hopefully they create a sequel for clive where he is a conquistador and explores area out of valisthea full of new poc dominants. I want more clive rosfield action!
@timmytimmy mit  dude youreally use the term  poc
nioh devs got it too for the main character being a  white saviour
except that doesnt make sense because ff takes place in fictional universes  so they clearly aren t real life ethnicities. same with anime. are edward and al japanese because they are anime characters
and that is why video games  and entertainment mediums in general  have been so stale lately. more companies are concerned about what someone will say about their product rather that delivering a good product.
@raifseverence  I dont think its been stale at all. perhaps you ve just been following the wrong games and entertainment mediums.
spiderman is one of the most relatable superheroes  even though Im asian.some journalist especially western think that diversity is only revolve around skin colour.while in asia  diversity also about different culture  ethnic  belief  religion  food  and language.
what liberals dont realize is in japan  white people are diverse here. anyone that isn t japanese is diverse here. as a non-japanese person living in sapporo  I cantell you I stand out like a sore thumb lol. the same reason you see westerners become fascinated with eastern culture is the reason japanese show interest in western cultures  its different from what we live every day. so while liberals are complaining about seeing white people in a video game purely because liberals are racist  remember that while white may be a majority in one country  they are a minority  and seen as  diverse  in most other countries around the world.
yoko taro is genuinely legendary
the journalist knew what they were doing when they asked that question. itseemed like a set up tbh. no one who actually enjoys the games were pressed about them not having poc. you cant force people to conform their art to make you always feel included. some of my favorite games are jrpgs and they dont have a poc in sight but that isn t even something that crosses my mind when Im enjoying the game
when you play the game of wokes you live or you die
you are the best. thank you for continuing to try and explain what fantasy means to uneducated people.
I still wait for that day where a big game studio is asked to  add more diverse characters  and they just answer with just a simple  no . kinda like that r6 meme.
I am so freaking excited for this game.......
amen sister. amen. I literally couldnt have said it better.
ran into your channel after diving into the frost craziness. awesome content creator.. you have an interesting accent. like you liked in wisconsin for 15 years and then moved to the south for the last 15 lol
to melonie s point  the actual fans dont really care if the characters are diverse.
people complained about 2b but nothing in the game itself alluded to her sexuality until that line   you want to    2b.  the very people who were simping over her have tried to fit the  ambiguity  of thatsame line to fit their own agendas  even though it was completely inconsistent with the story to interpret it that way. the moral of the story  pay attention to the lore and not the looks.    r.g.
as a writer that bothers me because if I didn t know the woman I was writing in as one of the Christian films was a producer and has her own study Bible  her name is tia hall   I dont know what my film might look like after I finish the screenplay.
hImelonie for once again amazing interesting entertaining video. thenfl  mlb have been complaining formany years for their own opinions.I hope you know what Im trying to sayanyway.for taking your time onmaking these always entertaining videos.takecare melonie
people these days just lack character themselves which is why they desperately need to see parts of themself in anything availabe to public so others potentialy see it aswell. funny enough with all this identity and representation sh t today you can clearly keep apart the people that got their stuff together and the ones that dont.and after all I really dont get why so many people have this desperate desire to be important.....Imean I for one am happy if noone wants anything from me at all  p
you nailed it right on the head. you kickass. just fou d your channel. I love your take.
diversity is fascinating when its done organically not forced  couldn t agree more  thatshould seriously be the motto for today s era
Im whiter than snow  but my favorite princess is tiana from the princess and the frog. do I care thatshe is black  no  she could be green or purple for all I care. I like her because of what she represented. she s a strong  determined  independent woman that every little girl should aspire to be and look up to. it had nothing to do with her race. its okay to like characters that aren t the same race or sex as you.
a question some fans have been wondering since the game s announcement.   those people are not fans  they re an infestation.  they will never buy the game they just want to make sure it adhere s to their warped principles of morality.
ya know.  for all of square s dumbass moves  particularly with nft s lately  they sometimes make some really boss one s.  Im particularly interested in this cause Ive been wanting a ff game thats more high fantasy than sci-fI or  real world looking  for a while.
omg exactly!
you want to    2b. context  I played the game but dont remember this
you have brain cells use em  thats the thing I dont think these people at this point even have brain cells left since they all either commited suicide or outright left their bodies  honostly over the past year or so Ive seen people that are really tired of this  inclusivity  thing just creeping into everything and having creators feel the presure of having to make it all about it and now theres some legit blowback against it
if square enix stayed in japan and didn t set up hq in california  they would not have batted an eye
character design looks good. music sounds promising. everything looks good. more diverse in background  character depth and development and less in skin color.
since when do we play final fantasy for diversity  I think they do fine on diversity and if they dont want to put other characters in this specific game im fine. I was here for the story anyways which im pretty sure everyone else was. at some point.
I can almost guarantee that none of the people pitching a fit has ever played a ff game.
Im looking forward to ff xvI  and not once did I think there needed to be a hispanic in the game from watching the trailers. I dont look to be represented. if there s one thing I  miss  maybe it was the classic games letting me name everyone. yes I named characters like locke and zidane as me  hey I just realized  the ladies mane thief rogue characters were all me....  but at the same time I also understand that due to voice acting  thats not a thing anymore sadly. just give me a good game  story and world with interesting characters to play in  and Im good. I can go play guacamelee or something else if I need hispanic representation  but even then it was still a fun game in the world of lucahdores and over the top action and meme culture  it didn t care if you were hispanic or not to play. thats how all games should be  are you having fun  not catering to your fragile egos.
absolutely spot on
dark fantasy of sword and sorcery sounds sick. ff16 couldn t have asked for better press.
11 22 could not agree more
random statement  I love your honesty and hair.
one thing I have noticed about watching anime  is they will always have that one blonde and blue eye character play a main in something first before they show you a darker skin tone character.
my people isn t known much hmong  but when I see a reference of them I think its pretty cool. but I never heard anyone complaining about not seeing my culture on screen.
I agree with you 100
I didn t even know a white studio made ghost of tushima I dont care it is one of my fave games of all time such a amazing story and characters everything Imean I am doing a playthrough on my tiny channnel
Ive seen someone literally mad about playing final fantasy as human characters in general. they said that they refuse to play xvI because of it. like of all things  thats the reason why you wont play it lmfao.
new video yay!. here for it melonie!
article states that  some may not like this  key word being  some . square  thinking about the actual millions of final fantasy fans who they know will buy  play  and enjoy the work   yeah thanks for the advice but maybe we ll take our chances .
I grew up with sitcoms like family matters and the fresh prince of bel air  later on came my wife and kids... these were exclusively black sitcoms  but I loved them  even though Im a white european...Im sure plenty of black people also enjoyed full house and friends  and again  later on  according to jim...notice how all of them are american series  but we europeans got bombarded with them  and didn t even think about race...  most of us  anyways...  we just enjoyed their stories...who can forget steve urkel or carlton  or joey perhaps remember the most iconic line of urkel   did I do that
its just as you say  this toxic need for representation is just plain narcissism  since they dont have the talent to actually be in a movie even as an effin extra  they want tothers to do what they want and fullfil their lame need of atention  some people are getting really tired of this and I hope it finally ends.I am latino and I have no problem at all  to never see a mixed race person in a game or movie  ijust want to see an interesting character and a compelling story.
I like how the creators were basically like  yeah we were waiting for this question because you guys are obsessed with race.
uh  wut
@xeno solarus  what was unclear
melonie thoughts on final fantasy 15 I really liked it because it was right step in a big direction  after the mess of final fantasy 13
I bring up the anime thing all the time. my mentor is a diesel af black dude. we both do martial arts. we ve compared him to my  jiraiya  for years. he likes it. there is a stark difference in their complexions.
ff has generally been ahead of its time with  diversity and inclusion . they ve almost always had a 50  female cast and they are almost never used as only a romantic interest for the main character  they have their own personalities and flaws. in-fact  ff has a bit of a trope in that females tend to be the strongest characters in the story  often being summoners and casters. their games also often feature several black characters  despite their representation in japan being nearly zero. these are the correct kind of inclusions of diversity--the ones you dont have to think about and dont have this off-putting forced feeling of inclusion.
well said!
I dont mind them having a checklist of  what to include  because I have my own checklist of  what not to play .
ah yeah I was waiting for someone to cover how the rage is going on social media  I dont have any  since I read that interview.
well  looks like final fantasy xviI will be the last of the franchise if they decide to bend knee.
a lot of ff games have plenty of characters of other ethnicities  they can just play those games. valisthea is based on medieval europe and valisthea is geographically  technologically  geopolitically and culturally isolated from the rest of the world  therefore it makes perfect sense why only one race of people live in valisthea. a game doesnt need diversity representation to be good. characters dont need diversity representation to be good. good stories  good characters  good art and good mechanics are what make good games and good graphics  although not needed  and good music helps too. diversity representation is fine so long as it fits the setting  the writing is good  and the character s diversity representation isn t of importance  because it isn t important  what is important is everything else about the character  when characters are being created  their diversity representation should be saved for last if you want to tack that on to the character. the problem with most comics  movies  shows and games made in the west nowadays is that diversity representation and woke messaging are the only things of importance for them   the characters in them and woke messaging should have no place in anything except the real world  and even then woke messaging is still horrible and there are certain cases in real life where woke messaging should still not be allowed  like in schools for example.
I watch spongebob and  I can see myself in those characters  even though Im a human and not a sea creature
this is so ridiculous! if its not about skin colours  its about sexuality or other things like that. there are always some people which wont accept something or spread hate just for fun. I dont get it. Im getting tired about to discuss this sh  ! seriously!  just try to enjoy what you get or dont give it attention! damn!
representation doesnt have to be forced into a game for people to relate to them imagine you make a game of a story you worked a long time for and then it comes out only to be ridiculed for not having people of color so now you have to replace or add in a character because of pressure for the sake of representation
I love final fantasy my first game was ff8 then 7 and the rest.
gives me more of a reason to buy it
I remember when I was young someone asked why anime always had american white characters. the artist  I dont remember who  responded with they are actually japanese characters... lol
I can never tell the difference between one character ethnicity from another  it must be my monitor.
the reason they worry about race  gender or sexuality over anything else is so they dont have to be bogged down with writing a good story.
that pic of you an yer dad  with yer Godzilla shirt  shows how kawaiI you actually are  its a good shot  kupo   stay kewl   lvl-headed pretty lady  you a voice of reason in a world going mad
I blame ign for asking those stupid questions they knew exactly what they were doing
ff8 is one of the best games ever made
love you cutie. you are brave to defy the woke mob!
these people will never understand and be satisfied
it was a discombobulated mess  but I quite enjoyed it
15 was good but probably rushed and after the 8th chapter it became a bit of a drag.
@chandler burse  I think that why they now putting dlc   ectra chapther so that the story can continues  and have more time into the game
to be honest I quit after the ff 7 remake when they admitted they censored tifa.
@ashkihyena  we ve seen anna tswg  as tifa. nina infinity is going to cosplay her. wonder if melonie would make it a tifa trifecta
@ashkihyena  yes censored because her breasts aren t as big even though they honestly aren t small either and she still has the overall same design  its just like isn t it a bit of similar reaction to sjws refusing to play non diverse games when you also dislike a game simply because they barely nerfed a female character s tatas
@chandler burse  they weren t even nerfed that bad. if anything  I think they re better because they re not as cartoonishly big.
@xeno solarus  people here are kind of overreacting.
well it also depends on the anime. edward elric and arthur pendragon aren t japanese.
@xeno solarus  well Im from the 90 s back then we called it japanese anime or just japanime lol
finally someone with a like mind. I get so much crap because I like 8. the card game alone can be its own game
@butcher.cs   you get crap from those who aren t cultured enough to appreciate such things.  most aren t like that
we all agreed despite wich you preffer more ff 7 8 and 9 are the best the rest are cool lets see what 16 offer.
I recently just finished 8. got all the cards. all of the gfs. did all the side quests... including that really unrewarding one with shadow and mr. monkey and you end up with three stars after combing the field of lying rocks. beat ultima weapon and omega weapon.I even managed to do it all at keeping squall at level 7.and after having done all that... it was okay. I certainly dont think its garbage  as some claim it is. too many claim its awful and its far from being awful.it was one of those experiences where I cant say I absolutely loved it... but Im glad I saw it through. there were some sweet moments and triple triad alone is one of the best minI games sidequests ever.I cant say its in my top 5 final fantasies... but its not at the bottom either. and I can respect anyone who finds it to be an endearing masterpiece
4 an 6 are both better...
I ll always be a fan of ff 4 and ff6
I like anime too  I specifically love dragon ball z and vampire anime like hellsing  vampire knight  diabolik lovers and stuff like that  obviously this stuff cannot and shouldn t go woke. I never played final fantasy but I dont want the artists and developers ridiculed for wanting creative freedom  thats what being an artist is all about and I want creative freedom too so I put into perspective  how would you like it if someone took your creative freedom away
ah yes... adulthood... I can now sitsilent and let people talk  and then vote with my wallet.
the only time I notice a characters race is when I replay morrowind and hear in my ear  the all too familiar sound of 1  a cliff racer horde about to maul my ass for carelessness.2  n wah.3  s wit.if you know  you know  n wahs.
oh I haven t seen her in a long time   I remember I used to have crush on her watching her built her pc lol
melonie didn t sjws complain that there is no diversity in witcher 3
I d imagine they look it along the lines of an online journal
I vote with my dollars I dont care who is in the game Im waiting for it to go on sale at a deep discount or premiere on gamepass.   earlyretirement
hey melonie. could youreact to the mayor of chicago reviewing the safet act purge law  this crap is terrifying!
my favorite character colors for years were neon. why because those are the colors of lego s.racial issues have not ever concerned me at a intellectual level.because people are people. for man looks at the outward appearance  but the Lord looks at the heart.
doesnt disappoint me
aren t they japanese characters
Im just wondering when game creators will make characters just stick figures.
the only thing lacking is self reflection in these complainer s psyche
ign s question was pretty stupid. in japan creators dont care about about race and its not just limited to videogames  but in manga  anime or any kind of visual media.
it not like there is no going to be a dlc if the game is successful  then they might start adding stuff. from what I hear currently the game going to be in small isolated part of the big world to start with so who know what they going add in the futures. the best I can say to any story writer focus on the main theme you wish to tell or your story might fall flat chasing too many thing at once.
I tried reading some of the comments of that kotaku article. Im telling you  they are so narcist  they re dillusional. they really think they re in the right and should be the moral police of the world.
bring the heat  melonie! thanks for speaking truth!
idk Im black but grew up playing majority games with white leads. I always wanted more diversity but I also understood that its on those different diversities to create what they want to see.
Ive never seen this channel before and I haven t played an ff game since x. but as you have a gojira tattoo Im bound by oath to trust you.guess Im buying ff16 to spite these people.
Im a black guy with a japanese anime avatar of one of my favorite characters  takeshI sendo.I just like cool characters.
yes  antiwhites complained that indigenous peoples of europe weren t white erasing themselves from their own culture and art.
probably the same people that complained kingdom come deliverence lacked diversety  a game that played in a 15th century bohemia
@leonidas tri  funny thing is  if henry was in fact black  they d have a cry about playing as a black guy that is dirt poor and cant read  implying warhorse thinks black people are illiterate lol
they re european in this entry by the sound of it
@melonie mac go boom  oh  my bad
characters with blue eyes and blonde hair are japanese
@xtrickz elitex  its anime.
@xtrickz elitex  which group of people have red hair naturally  snd Imean actual read
@asana  white
@xtrickz elitex  so there s people who have blood red hair  like in my profile picture
thatsaid  if you have to see your skin tone in a piece of art to appreciate it  maybe youre the racist  not the artist.
I play nier automata and I love it games are allowed to have pretty beautiful characters its fantasy after all
yeah they aren t making a game of the person playing they are telling a  story of the people in the damn game
squeenix made their bed. they chose nfts and pandering to the  0k  mob. farewell to a dying franchise.
although square enix already said they re not focusing on japan anymore and are going to cater to north america  or something like that. thats bad if they choose the loud  wrong part of north america
when you talked about cultural accuracy and all that  I suddenly remembered how a lot of Christians these days are offended by the traditional depictions of Jesus and the saints as white or fair-skinned. in reality  mediterranean people are kinda fair in complexion. they re not all necessarily coffee brown or even black  as some nutjobs claim . besides  all races have depicted Jesus as looking more or less like themselves- ethiopians have made him look ethiopian  chinese have made him look chinese  europeans have made him look european   c. and thats not really a problem  because Jesus is the Lord and saviour of the whole world. he wants all people to come to him for salvation. I think it would be more commendable if these representation campaigners worked hard and created original characters that are set in their preferred cultural background instead of forcing every other game developer or filmmaker to check every box in their arbitrary list of diversity criteria.
wasn t going to get it at first  but now Imight.
when I was playing ghost of tsushima I was more than fine with  lack of diversity  or playing someone with different skin colour. these people are crazy.
who are these  fans  who dont like it because they re not fans
get woke  go broke!
it has a  sertting if high dark fantasy based on medivieval  europe inspiration so its depicting that culture in the creators vision.this isnt a lotr rings of power moment. and thatshow tanked in ff viiI we had kiros  in ff viI we had barrett  and in ff xiiI we has sahz and his son dahj.  also a black side character in ff strangers of paradise.thats the story they wanted to tell. now would it be cool if the game had you travel far distances where you end up in a town or village with different ethnicities based inspiration wise off other cultures  sure. but they didnt do thatso who caresalso square-enix literally has a high fantasy game coming out thatstars a black woman aka forespoken  so the wokey weirdos need to calm down
I cannot wait for ffxvi. Ive been a fan since ff 1 for nes. and Im glad that ff still sticks to its guns.
3 12  how much do you want to bet these people complaining are not fans at all  and just look for every reason to criticize anyone they can for not living up to the standards they are pushing.
melonie  if you haven t seen it yet  epic rap battles just did indiana jones vs lara croft
Im definitely going to play this game next year. hopefully the devs ignore this stupid pointless criticism.
its a japanese property. it would be funny if they said  ok  they are all going to be japanese now.
never played a ff before. I ll make sure that I ll play this one take that wokies  p
final fantasy is not really based in any real world period. its just based on the previous works of anime and games that came out in the last few decades since japanese media got popular. thats why the characters still act animeish  dress coolly and have crazy hair. fantasy worlds usually have races like elves and dwarfs to avoid the actual skin tone races of the real world that can cause offend someone in real life. in a way  the fantasy is where people are supposed to escape to. shoving real life racial issues in would be contradicting why people play games in the first place so you can expect a lower sell. go woke  go broke
go boom  melonie!!
ign has been a joke for almost a decade now. I still dont get where they get funding from.
agreed. hopefully it wont trickle into dq12
youre joking right
I saw the other day that harvestella  a new square enix game that actually does look interesting  has a  non-binary  gender option. so thats already a bad sign.
and the good thing about those characters were that they weren t forced.
yup it usually it has black ppl like 7 8 10  and 12 and 17 probably will too
they will probably make a sequel starring clive as a conquistador or explorer and he stumbles upon a continent full of poc  new dominants new eikons! ffxvi-2  clive s return or ffxvi-2  clive s expedition
love erb! thx 4 the tip
co-opt  consume and destroy... its the leftie way!
I love the return to the medieval setting for ff and my only downside to it is for me is no turn-based combat trad job class system.
yoshI p. can do whatever the f he wants he is a God these days in the world of game development. I have been playing his ffxiv for 9 years and it has been magical
in anime and other japanese media  assume everyone is japanese unless otherwise specified  especially if the character is blond and blue eyed. ie - naruto.
its nice to see someone talking about video games that is not woke af.
what you want people to be treated like people  without regard to  insert x y z etc here   hahaha  I knew there was a reason I liked your videos. stay safe. take care. have fun.
yoshi-p just needs to ignore these idiots.
nothing to worry about.it ll come out  sell well and prove it doesnt even matter.
what s worst is the fact thatsquareenix will most likely to bend the knee
maybe we need to include them into it just like in resident evil 5. xd
fun game for the  journalist  who wrote that article.  name 5 main chars in all of final fantasy that are poc
gotta check off those boxes or the woke mald all their hair
when will these people realize that  representation  is actually racism. if you cant relate to a character unless they share your skin color  you are racist. as if skin color is gonna make a character magically  just like you . Im south east asian and whenever I see an asian movie  my first thought isn t   oh  they re just like me . my first thought is if the cinematography is good  then is the acting and story good.
a few years ago the journalists were complaining about a lack of female characters in final fantasy in the previous decade  when ff14 and ff15 were the only new ff games in said decade  ff14 had a female main character and 2 sequels  and ff14 is an mmo with a ton of female main characters on top of the players being able to make female characters. ff15 was the only game made that had an all male core group  yet somehow it was a huge problem
they could always make their own final fantasy. oh wait thats right they re creatively challenged so they must force the wokeness onto existing successful ips. makes sense
more inclined to buy the game now
final fantasy has always had a diverse cast. there have been multiple lead female characters. and diverse party members final fantasy is usually leading the way in these things. heck look at forespoken. it has a really strong black female lead.just give them a break and let them tell the story they want to make. even ff14 is really diverse. ff16 isn t set in modern society let races live in their own regions. the world might not have opened up and been as interconnected at this time as travel isn t as easy as it is in this day and age. or might only available to the rich  not everyone can just jump in an airship. and the terrain might be to difficult to pass on foot for most people  or to sail.
thankfully a lot of people are getting sick of this and speaking out
the japanese people responsible for final fantasy have always preferred white characters. its just kind of a thing  why is it bad
I will be buying 10 copies of the game. long live square enix.
the protagonists of stories are allegories of ourselves  regardless of physical or mental  dis similarities  think do i.
ff wasn t turned base since the atb.I dont mind the gameplay changes. Im worrying this game will be a linear sequel baiting title with an abundance of dlc  spinoffs and different media tie in.  franchise inside a franchise franchise .Imiss when ff is a one off masterpieces that had a plot opening more vast as you play than an isolated direction thats already been brief in the start of the game. an ambitious world building and travel.nowadays we re getting discount xenoblade chronicles 1 with better graphics and particle effects.xenoblade sequels should be the staple of how a franchise upgrade itself  making every content bigger. than making a playable soft opera.
@norman readdis  atb system is still a turn based just a variation on the turn based formula.
@the magus  ff dev already stated this decades ago its not turned base  it was the evolution of the mechanic going in more interactivity in battle and just because of the tech it wasn t fully realize yet and they cannot bring seiken densetsu combat in it because of the technological limits at that time if they want to include both graphics and gameplay  they found a balance on the graphics and content started with viI then x goes full eye candy and the journey shrink into corridors and a one straight obvious plot.remember we thought the escape of midgard was already the peak then the story unfolds more to a catastrophic world ending event since 1 to 9  then 10 happened and the journey is lay down flat  xiI story is so isolated that it looks like an extended tactics episode focuses on war only and xiI was a straight a to b plot alone without its sequels  xv not vsxiiI was a broken masterpiece thatshould ve been the best example of a modernize ff but itsuffers from development hell because they want to have all the business practices in one leading to broken promises because they re busy making the movie tie in and scrap the game content and put a shoehorned multiplayer to monetize one part of the story alongside all the cut content as dlc because they cannot let it be  60 game which I understand about the cost but I whould love to shell  300 on a fully realize xv at the bat day one  no dlc episodes no shoehorn multiplayer and not other media tie in  3 continent fully explorable including tennebrie  insomnia and niffleheim and other sites that was stated in the texts with its world of ruin counterpart as well  also male that 10 year blip be playable as other characters. I dont need no fishing vr or any seasonal event collab. this propel franchise of a franchise in full blast. ff is always evolving and and always trying to modernize itself on what s the trend of that year. nowadays they re regressing in place of eye candy.
@norman readdis  to each his own  I just prefer turn based medieval european fantasy in my final fantasy. you and Imay agree to disagree. I know  this game will be action based but I am just stating what I prefer. no need to get defensive. this game looks good. if it disappoints you or me atleast in my case I have old games and books I can enjoy for the nth time over. but I believe this one will be excellent even though the battle system is not to my liking and I am unaware of party  members and also lack of a job class system is down side only on those notes. on every other note it looks phenomenal and I am anxiously expectecting it.
@the magus  I know but ff is always about evolving the franchise but the lore and myths is the main factor of consistency in it  I know because I am a squaresoft fan since. you got nostalgia on the first 6 games when the trend didn t change  but evem 6 went steampunk  because the dev cycle is close unlike nowadays that can consist of 5 to 8 years at minimum.if you want a consistent medieval turn based game  they have dragons quest. its literally its main mantra.
@norman readdis  I disagree with you on what final fantasy means. to me it means medieval european high fantasy to you it means  evolving the franchise  not what amano and sakaguchI created I think 6 7 8 10 12 13 15 should have been separate ips I would have probably enjoyed them but they differentiated to much from what the original creators intended it was nomura s fault I honestly dont see it as much of an  evolution  but to each his own. as for dragon quest thats  final fantasy lite. its more fanciful fairytale and nursery ryhme than fantasy more like an old disney film pre-1990 s. hardly comparable to something like final fantasy especially ff9 ff11 and fft ffta and ff14 which has more gravitas and is medieval high fantasy and the upcoming ff16. much different from the whimsy of dragon quest although I like ff and dq both true ff games and dq both sides of the same. medieval coin. one is for youth and the other for older and wiser minds. both equally good just different flavors. and it is not that I dont like sci-fI true Im not the biggest fan. but I like franchises that are accurate to the source material and that have some consistency not things that just try something new for spectacle rather than making a quality product. plenty of sci-fI games and shows that are series that do well and that I like that dont betray what came before while still making room for new things and the same can be said for fantasy settings as well. I would  not have ignored ff7 13  15 if they were separate ips I probably would have loved them to me  they aren t final fantasy games though. because thats not what final fantasy means to me. like I love metroid for gamecube I wouldn t want samus to dress like a john wayne cowboy and ride a unicorn into narnia that would be killing the ip in my opinion. that is what square is doing with ff when they betray the medieval fantasy setting at least in my eyes.  you may disagree but this is how I feel as a true ff fan and a fan of classical fantasy and classic final fantasy. I respect your take but this my take.
@the magus its your definition but the makers of it was never meant it to be that  its a fanstasy rpg that fits whatever age it was inspired with. its just that medieval is the trend back in the day and bruh dq was first than ff. its more like ff is a trendy dq. I played all of their games and I know the company since its inception  every statements  e3 promotion etc.
@norman readdis  I know dq was first but we can agree to disagree on the meaning of ff. dude we are both fans plus you aren t amano or sakaguchI so your claim that this was not their intent is meaningless if it wasn t their intent they would have never made it the way it was back then. I think your off base on many points. but just dont get so hung up on it. I like one particular interpretation of ff you like another particular interpretation.  we are both fans although of different iterations just leave it at that. and quit trying to get into arguments. just respect my take and I shall respect yours. chill out dude. relax.
@the magus  sakaguchI and amano had said it  I remember it always. if yt exist back in the day I can provide you with a clipit was supposed to be their last game so they made it for what s in at that time.https   youtu.be xuwkvyeau0esatire but with context.
I think ffxvI will be magical!
dude that vid you sent is hardly proof it looks like some bad deep fake some incompetant internet trolls made
when you want to have a civil discussion about something without resorting to childish behavior and making an inane circular argument then speak to me other than that you aren t worth my time. stop attacking the fans. end of discussion. I will block you unless you behave.
I gave the olive branch I wont block you. I still offer you a chance either change the topic and be more respectful to your fellow man. dont target people with different points of view than your own. as I said numerous times before you have your take I have mine leave it at that.
@the magus  Imean  youre absolutely wrong that final fantasy means medieval europe type setting. that was true for the first few titles  but even since 6 each game has been increasingly unique. also  you ve never played dragon quest if thats what youre taking away from it. both ff and dq are amazing series. you should give some dq games a try. 12 is really good. I also really loved 8.
I dont see them bending the knee on this because they have a ton of the game made already I am guessing.  that will lead to them not being able to go back and redo all that work.
they have lots of black characters in ff lol
@chris foy  yeah  but thats blackface  so...
@diogenes dworkinson  naw
@chris foy  look into your heart. you know it to be true. embrace your woke!
@chris foy  do they  the only ones I can remember from the top of my head are barrett from viI and sazh and his son from xiii. unless youre talking about a bunch of random npcs that were mostly likely only present in viI onwards or something  I dont remember any.
@                         the dude from 8 who was with laguna I forget his name the skinny one. also donna and buddy who are side characters in x-2. general leo from 4 isnt confirmed but his skin is dark as hell and reddas is kind of racially ambigous so I just went with the voice actor they gave him and the voice actor is black. those and the obvious barret and sazh
@chris foy  kiros - ff8
@Christine h  yea him. kiros. I remember reading back in the day that michael jackson was used for his design
same here!
I want more clive rosfield action!
I want some escapism in my escapism. I dont want to to see tokens and boxticking or the message.
I wont buy from square enix ever again anyway  but Im glad they re sticking to their guns on this. people should just stand up for what they like and be honest.
just because someone has braincells doesnt mean they re smart lol!
I dont see anyone slamming black panther for blackness. I hope square enix tells these woke children to take a hike and stick to the lore.
even in anime japanese characters are drawn white looking. in japan skin lightening is common  the majority of japanese people are brown to light brown. but the majority of them use some lightening products. also japanese  korean  chinese they have distinctive eyes that are different from africans or europeans. so for them to make the eyes big and more oval shape and the skin white looking  would be the equivalent of them making an east african anime characters skin white then straightening the hair... their no longer going to look east african much like after whitening and changing the shape of then nose and eyes of japanese anime characters no longer make them look like natural japanese person. the fact is the majority of japanese actors you see in the west have had plastic surgery or use some kind of lightening product. japanese people should care more that they are not being represented in their own media. because none of these characters in the final fantasy games even look remotely japanese. as someone who lived in japan I am talking from experience here.the problem isn t lack of black people in these games  its the lack of japanese people.
though I do agree on what yoshida said and cant wait for ff16 I do question in my mind why there isn t a black main protagonist in the ff series which Im a huge fan of only one came close to mind is barret from ff7.I would like diversity to be a thought not a force and unorganic
this world is insane
funny enough though that all ff characters are canonically japanese
will buy it day one now  I dont even own a ps5
some of the franchise s fans.  bullshit. fans aren t the ones whining about this.
ifritsummon probably will be the  diverse  character
well I kind of do understand because asians do have many different colors and it would be really nice to see those types of colors in the game like mortal kombat!but if its all white in the storyline then it needs to be all white cuz its based off a good realistic storyline
Ive always thought a majority of the characters were asian thats just me tho
what is melonies accent   its fucking adorable.
5 55 tiktok creators  hold my beer
I find it hilarious when americans try to school us europeans on our own history  demographic and culture lol. thank you yoshida.
the complainers will still secretly buy it and love it
my eyes are getting sore of rolling when I hear stuff like this.  cant wait to play ff16
about to get this game because it doesnt have any darkies in it.
I feel there are some healthy middlegrounds here.for example  I dont need to see myself in the characters  but thats just me - Ive always been fairly independent. there are people who  for many reasons  feel more comfortable with that - and thats okay. as long as they dont take it too far  thats not narcissism  thats being told that people like them exist and they re allowed to feel like they belong. I can come close to understanding their perspective  as a pacifist Ive noticed that pacifistic characters are rare  and the few that exist are either self-righteous jerks or completely wimpy pushovers  and I dont like that people think of pacifists that way  because there are nuances there worth exploring.
I hope enjoy it ffxvI will be great!
americans iz re al is not a state.
who plays final fantasy to see themselves represented
sounds like Im gonna preorder....
cant wait to play the last good ff game now that they are going woke after this one.
what a world what a world...
telling japanese people their games aren t diverse enough does take some hubris.
I cant wait for forspoken. I believe the final fantasy xvI is a true ps5 exclusive. we need a pc release!
give into them once and they will never not show up to ruin stuff.
to quote frosk  if you dont like it  dont buy it.
the modern audience will attack anything.
friendly reminder that while sony is complaining about the ms activision deal because  call of duty should be for everyone on every console  they paid square enix to make ff16 a ps console exclusive for 6 months.
see as squareenix announced that they will no longer cater to japanwse audiences and eather go for a more global target  the production of this game might go through hell.
so...silence for final fantasy I through xv
how fortunate that final fantasy wasn t developed with people like this in mind as its intended majority audience.
if all these critics want what they consider more inclusion then they should become more creative and create these mediums themselves... not try to force the truly creative people to appeal to their sensibilities... the arrogance of some people is astounding...
cant make this shit up. I cant wait for this game
the real sad thing here is that at the moment there are a minority of ultra woke people which happens to have a great deal of influence in big company media departments. I am still wondering how it has come to this.
if japan goes woke  the world is effed.
this is why it is so easy to tell japanese games from western games. japanese games have gasp pretty women who might dress sexy  and not every race represented.
hell  I bought nier specifically because of 2b. just like I bought bayonetta because of bayonetta. I like beautiful women in games. im a gen x. we love our beautiful video game girls.
no actual ff fans are complaining about this. ugh  Im black and never thought about this growing up. I just enjoyed stuff.
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners
there s something extremely dehumanizing about referring to people of different ethnic backgrounds as  color   as the relationship between contrast  black and white. there s something odd and sickening about it
and guess what  its gonna sell like gangbusters
with sazh and barrett  final fantasy has done more for representing black men and fathers than about any other franchise. so yeah  they re fine.
there are too many checkmarks in this generation. people complaining are mostly those who dont even play the game like  let the producer do what they want  its their own stuff plus what they ve done is what made the title popular until today. plus those who are overly sensitive over these are mostly in western countries. dont like it  dont buy it.. other regions dont give a shit as long as it has compelling storytelling and great gameplay mechanics..
kotaku is going to find something stupid to complain about. its just a question of what.
yoshi-p and creative business unit 3  not square enix  are one of the few people companies I trust with videos games today. they make video games to make video games  not this diverse woke bull shit. yoshi-p has a history as a gamer himself and has steered cbu3 to massive success so far. I trust them more than square enix.
its a fetish lets call it for what it is
yoshida-san basically  in his extremely polite japanese manner  said  this is how we do in japan. you dont like it  dont play it.  got to love how based the japanese are compared to many here in the us. to a one  all the gamers I know couldn t care less about  muh representation.  and yes  legit organic  diversity  is far better and more enjoyable than the forced militant pc variety that people all over america are finally spitting back in the faces of its creators and telling them  we didn t ask for this and we dont want it  now get lost.  works for me!
they did the same thing to gow ragnarok!!  made angrboda black fkr no reason. also  the original director for gow 2018 was replaced for this new game
I absolutely hate the  mixed bag  diversity thats being shoved into every ip. I just watched an episode of wheel of time and it feels so weird that in this tiny little isolated corner of the world  there are like five different distinct races of people all intermingled but they haven t homogenized. that just couldn t happen.then they do things like have one character say to another  youre not from here are you   or bring in a merchant guy seemingly from far away  but there s no feeling of that because all the races are represented equally everywhere. it ironically ruins the richness of a fictional world to just have every civilization look the same with idealized  diversity .then on top of that  to have a bunch of westerners americans tell a japanese studio that their game has to look like modern day united states  honestly who do these people think they are  they re the ones accusing everybody else of having a western-centric worldview at the same time that they re shoving their ideology on the entire world.
Im beginning to think this movement is how these talentless people feel somehow talented.
Ive been playing ffxiv for years.  I just checked out the trailer for ffxvI and you know what   I didn t give a darn about the ethnicity of any of the characters.  sign me up for a pre-release copy !!!
if diversity inclusion equity was anything more than a trojan horse  they d be working on unlearning their unconscious bias against cultures that dont hate whI ppl.
we will never disappear  no matter how mad they get.
people dont know this but the japanese have made many of their characters in anime  manga  games  etc. white for decades
remember when games where just made to be good games and noone gave a flying fuck about the characters gender or skin-color  where representation just came natural when it fit the games narrative  good times... good times
I think Imyself am open to creative freedom so long as its not intentionally looking to be particularly offensive to certain audiences which I dont see ff16 to be. at the same time though  agreeing with some of how extreme this has gotten on the  woke side   I want to also express how we should be fair here and criticize  just as well  the  anti-woke side  of the spectrum with their own extremities.what do Imean by that   take for example something like the game  forspoken  and its black female protagonist  there are plenty of people on the other end of the spectrum posting on social media  criticizing the game for being  woke  for not sticking to some arbitrary subjective standard of your typical white male lead.I just think if we re going to criticize one extreme end of the spectrum  we should also do the same with the other in all fairness.  otherwise we re coming off as blatant hypocrites  no
and what Im getting sick of Im getting sick of me not being able to say what I want on a call of duty lobby. Imiss the days of modern warfare 2 where you have to be able to nut up or shut up
personally when I come across a game that doesnt let me play as a female  I just dont play. I really dont care. usually I ll get it for my son so I can watch.  but.... I wish they made a mouse for left handers lol. my husband laughs at the way I play. for some reason I cross my arms and my right hand on the keyboard and my left hand on the mouse.  dont ask....
good on the producer for standing his ground on it. its all about the contents of the characters regardless of race  sex  origins  etc. anyone can find representation in great written characters. again  its the same narcissistic people who do not support the product in the first place complaining to get their way. get over it and grow up.
congratulationsyou are selected among my giveaway winners
youre missing out
been saying thatsince cancel cultured started.
I thought we were all supposed to be color blind
I have never cared about a characters ethnicity  race  religion  gender identity sexual preference etc  I only care about 2 things is the game fun  is the story good.
its so ironic how the people who are most into identity politics are the very ones not honoring the identities of established characters.
they......they know its a jrpg right
I think it ll look a lot like  modern day earth .it wont look like 2022 los angeles. nothing wrong with la as a setting if thats the kind of game you wanna make. but in a lot of the world  no  its pretty much a vast majority of one ethnicity  and a small minority of the rest. not for malicious reasons  its just that most places in the world aren t particularly places that people have reasons to move to. urban areas are more diverse because cities attract people from all over  but what s in the tiny town in michigan where I grew up thats gonna attract visitors or new residents
they can create anything they want  its just they refuse too because they refuse too listen to anyone with a ounce of intelligence or common sense.
so  x washing established characters and even historical characters is fine and they re like  why do you care man  its a game. its fantasy . but when a creation is not to their liking they cant take their own advice. and of course they re incapable of creating their own content  so all they re doing is trying to corrupt someone else s.
I hardly ever see myself represented in games  i.e.  a stupid  middle-aged  non-athletic  short  fat man with moobs  and I am a-okay with that.
dude people are just ruining everything for everyone. everything in the future is gonna suck
the fact that this interviewer felt the need to ask these questions is cringe.  even worse  by a mile  is the kotaku opinion piece that came out after this interview.
let s put their face on a stop sign they have to see themselves in things right so why not put their faces everywhere
it didn t even bother them that they say this to a developer who is  not white  who doesnt even mind that he is not represented in his own creation. like seriously you are so  spot on  on  narcissism
there was a mass effect krogan thatsaid it best .   inflict on them the worst insult one can receive  to be ignored. these individuals and entities are not deserving of attention. of course  because of the plethora of sheep out there  this bullshit hass to be called out in order to help curb its infectious spreading.  but for those with common sense  who are not sheep  we see these disingenuous  insecure attention  seeking individuals and companies for the bullshit that they are full of  and give them what they deserve  to be ignored.
okay if they dont cave - I ll play this game. because its getting hate. xd
this literally reminds me of when outlets gave the developers behind kingdom come  deliverance shit because  white people bad  even if its historically accurate.  they literally said almost word for word the same things about that game.
I buy it 2 times to f ck the people up xd I love ff end I will never change it
I am asian and looking for a solid game which made me fall in love with final fantasy in the first place. completely tired of this. yoshI p has been amazing for video games for all.
people are so self-absorbed. there are universal values and universal stories. thats why people love these franchises just because. its not about any of these superficial physical indicators thatsociety is obsessed with.
marry me melonie! you are the best  ddddd  great takes.
@the magus  well  I was trying to be polite.  the irony is that being  woke  is supposed to mean one is more self-aware.
@thewyrdsmythe  yeah I know you were joking. and that you were trying to be polite. I like making funnies too. funny thing is those fellas calling themselves woke are the most asleep clueless people around. cheers
nobody cares what color the characters are just make the gameplay fun and the story engaging
just produce great stories... only!
step 1  guilt-trip devs into adding token diversity into their games.step 2  complain that there s not enough or weren t shown off in a good enough light or find some other petty thing to be mad about. repeat
I love that japanese people dont play into the race game.  representation  is super narcissistic
last I checked japanese are very fair skinned by nature
oh no  white man bad.  thats what I hear now every time these people scream. and I couldn t care less  Ive got way too many games and more important things to care about than pay attention to these people anymore.
what fan was wondering about the diversitiy I wonder  fans just play the games  its usually the non-fans and journalists seeking clicks that come up with hits b.s.
if every game is diverse be diverse by making a nondiverse game  p diversity really has more to do with location  then anything. a that game took place on the continent of africa will have very different demographic then one made in northern japan.
cant make a tv show without a check list.cant make a movie without a check list.cant write a book without a check list.now you cant make a video game without a check list.go play sims if you want to see yourself portrayed in a game.
the team didn t want to assign  distinctive ethnicities  to either the antagonist or the protagonist of final fantasy xvI to avoid  inviting unwarranted speculation and ultimately stoking the flames of controversy.  translation  they re aware that if they put any ethnicity in any role that may do anything questionable  they ll be labeled as racists. this is the world the hyper  woke  built. developers are well aware they can do nothing right by depicting different ethnicities anymore  so the more  generic plain-man  the better in terms of appearance. this is the bed they made.thatsaid  I honestly would be all for an epic fantasy story drawing on africantribes  cultures  and magics. armor and weapons with thatsort of stylistic vibe  a warrior wearing less armor and wielding a spear  cannibalistic monsters of african legend  giant snakes and monsters. lions or cheetahs as a typical hunter companion instead of the usual wolves or bears. think wakanda  but more tribal fantasy and less advanced sci-fI tech.
I d pay to sniff melonie s chair
if youre unable to like a character solely because they re a different race etc. than you  then thats on you. Im sorry you cant enjoy a well written character because  to you  their value is only in their skin color.
so hypocritical how all the whiners about representation or whatnot in a certain work are just called  fans  in these articles- and they may or may not be actual fans of the thing. but when disappointed fans call out companies for things to do with the work s quality  then they re  toxic fans  or  trolls .
I love the boondocks and Im white.I dont need to be pandered to by writers and studios.just make a good story with enjoyable characters and I ll support it.its that easy.
Im not racist at all. I create characters of different ethnicities all the time. I dont care what they are. humans need to remember we are the spirit not the body. the spirit isn t black white or asian. its Godlike pure cosmic divine energy with an awareness that is unmatched.
honestly at this point  good. let them be mad.
Im not even a final fantasy fan  but as an artist and writer  there is no reason for anyone to focus on race or gender ideologies and representation. just write a story  develop a character  and make sure it is entertaining. representation does not get you very far  ie. ms. marvel  rings of power.
these are the same people that boycotted final fantasy 13 trilogy. but the trilogy still worked and made buck. heck  I bought the games twice. once in xbox  and another time in steam.
I dont understand. ive been playing games 20  years now. I have never wanted to be  represented  in any game. never cared what race or gender the characters were. literally the games were that came up at all  were ones like fallout  or mass effect  were when I was younger I would make myself and play the character like myself  but other that lol who cares.
people being so upset about the skin color of characters in fiction reveals them for their true ideology. hint  its not  diversity  or  inclusivity . itstarts with r and ends with ism. they re hiding their heinous motives through the veil of a savior complex.
the woke would probably find a way to complain about that too unfortunately.
ffxvi-2 sequel clive rosfield becomes a conquistador or explorer searching for eikons  discovers a continent outside of valisthea full of poc new eikons or dominants.
fantasy the faculty or activity of imagining things  especially things that are impossible or improbable.  I want to see myself   then make your own shit
Im sorry  I cant find it in me to care enough to watch  but I ll leave a comment because it helps your channel.  Im not interested in a franchise I outgrew over a decade ago. it would be like caring if they paint barney a different color
Im asian american and I dont care who makes a game  all us gamers want is a quality triple a game!
wakanda fantasy 7 or no buy!
people can cry diversity all they want but fundamentally outside of the game development team they get zero say in this regard as its not even about the game itself  they are complaining about the lore behind the game and that lies with the developers and not the players.they need to realise not all games are made for you and if you dont like a game  play something else you do.
smart girl  support from poland  d
representation has time and again proven to ruin entire products. the focus on that is so heavy it ruins those things. have a diverse cast  sure  but give us a good story  an engaging world  and intriguing plots first.
to be honest as a fan Imight skip ff16 altogether because it didn t feel like a final fantasy game I feel like square is turning final fantasy into the  the witcher and devil may cry just  appease the western audiencebig fan of your work  melanie stay out  spoken and beautiful as ever
I thought it didnt matter since they are fictional  what happened to that
I dont know if people realize this but nearly 80  of anime jrpg characters have european white features. anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves. I dont really care for anime though so I dont really have a stake in this  just an observation from what Ive seen.
youre introverted    good one
this gives me so much hope. a focus on characters and world creates a memorable game. fucking diversity quotas dont!
there is a limit to everything and trying to force diversity is how you get people to go the opposite direction and make people hate others through your never-ending nagging about  being right .even she added   getting sick of it  halfway through the video and that is right. when people get sick of your self-righteousness  it undermines those who are being genuine about a topic and will push people to go another direction.
doesnt it have the name fantasy in the title. enough said. its a fantasy game  like all media
I play the game for the story and not for the inclusiveness. the game developer is free to do what they want and that fits their idea.
I dont think they re depicted as white  they re depicted as japanese and how like anime they are colored that way.
as their japanese isn t having a full white cast like the most divers thing they can do
diversity of thought is what we really need.  the policy that these far left extremist grifters are pushing will not help with this problem.  I am left leaning  but I think that the social policy they are pushing goes much too far and that it will only serve agitate racial tensions rather than mend them.
in all honest if these people wanted the game to be the way they want it to be they can learn to make them in all honesty. that or buy an actual gaming pc instead of their little  150 walmart chromebook or off brand apple laptop and learn to mod the game to be how they want it.
people creating problems where it doesnt exists. humanity sure has surpassed metal gear.
I am waiting to hear what the woke numbskulls think of black myth  wukong
idc if its  too white  it just looks boring I haven t enjoyed an  ff game since 12
fried chicken  I agreeI liked 12  and I have to admit that even that was  meh   in terms of story.
yes  very much so. introverts are capable of talking to a camera  in fact better than extroverts. extroverts tend to thrive more on livestreams.
@melonie mac go boom  honestly that is interesting. I would have thought the opposite  but I guess I can see why you are right.  you are in the comfort of your home  no-one is really there. you just always seem so lively  and energetic and gym enthusiast. so figured you were the life of the party out of the house.
the people complaining will probably never play the game.
I love that japan wont get strong-armed by people who dont play their games. also  by the way  square enix is developing forspoken  a game with a female of color protagonist  so what s all this noise about  bet these people wont buy that either.
the woke checklist ends up just making every story the same and there ends up being no diversity to anything at all
play woke games win woke prizes
the story and game play is what matters in games  diversity is not needed and most people that will play these games dont care for it in the games.
ohhh nooo they did not go after my man yoshI p they ain t rdy for that fight this man has so many fans from all over the world of many cultures and races the woke mob have no idea what they are doing here
Ive never played a game and wondered where are the blk ppl. all I care about is if the game is good.also if ppl have such a problem then they should create their own game  and see how poorly itsells.
these people just have nothing better to do and want to pretend they are these moral Gods.
imagine telling a creator that his european-inspired setting is too white. the best part is thatsaid creator is japanese. as an asian  I dont want to see representation especially if it ruins the creator s vision. I am just happy that ff16 is in a medieval setting.
the main character looks asian but thats just me
thankfully yoship isn t going to bow down to this shit. like holy shit Im a black man and I literally dont care that the next game in my favorite franchise might not have black people in it  Im just ready for the next game.edit  this comment section is a breath of fresh air after seeing the comment section on the actual article.
final fantasy are very diverse games. made by japanese developers featuring mainly white and black characters. very progressive  d
authenticity matters
know what these woke people dont understand  a creator gets to make his her characters however they want. period. representation based on  just because  matters literally zero. someone wants a mix  cool. someone want them all to be white  cool. black  cool. its up to them. period.
we re not allowed to have things to call our own anymore  or have a heritage
I personally love the diverse cultures in our world. what I hate is if all these cultures were all equally gray because everyone now needing everything to be equally  diverse . imagine a japanese movie set in japan  now needing 20  black people  20  hispanic  even though 95  are japanese in japan. its totally ridiculous...
God of war ragnarok is bringing diversity to norse mythology. angrboda the mother of monsters is race swapped in the game. she is lokI s lover and the mother of the world serpent  hel  and the wolf fenrir.
japan must think we are loony tunes.
there are no poc characters in this game made by a japanese company set in a medieval era setting  and that is problematic once again  these people are making a thing about a thing thats not really a thing. its a final fantasy game  get over it!
I am a middle eastern and has been playing games  watching anime from japan since I was a kid in the 80s. in addition to watching movies  cartoons and reading comics. never ever thought that hey superman or kenshiro doesnt look like me so I ain t watching that. I think such people should do themselves a favor and find a different hobby.
like  japan is aware that the majority of this criticism comes from ppl who doesnt play games at all
diversity is fine when it makes sense. too often its shoe horned in for the sake of appeasing the woke which has a track record of cheapening the experience. house of the dragon is an example that did it well in my opinion
final fantasy xvi-2  clive s expedition. clive becomes a conquistador or explorer searches for the treasure of eikon. stumbles an unknown land out of valisthea. he meets new poc characters who are new dominants to new eikons
I see a lot of  representation doesnt matter  dont play the woke game  comments and I can agree to an extent  but also yeah studios can do better.a vast majority of games just tend to feature white male protagonists and at one point it was because they believed this was a good enough example of a default human that any player could imprint on.. with silent protags like master chief okay yeah blank slate can work  but there is an actual intent to continuously not make an effort to improve storytelling requirements to allow for more inclusive stories.
Im glad that we will always have polish  eastern european  and east asian developers that aren t going to bend the knee to these people and develop authentic medieval european settings. its sad that we can no longer rely on western developers to deliver such products and people not even from europe are better able to do so. yoshida sounds like he s just had enough of the woke crap and is just going balls to the wall on everything they hate--straight  white  masculine characters.medieval europe is my ancestry and cultural heritage  and  diversity  will just dilute it. and Im not apologising.
im definitely buying it now
a ff story with a medieval fantasy setting is exactly the type of game I want to support. I was going to get it anyway but it makes me feel even better to support a game that did let woke nonsense get in the way of its development and be true to themselves and their vision.
bro they need to stop with this. this ideology is what will ruin what many of us used to enjoy. and as a black person playing video games I do not go into this like man look at the lack of representation. honestly I go into it looking for hopefully its a great story. this will be another core memory and hopefully the gameplay doesnt suck. but every time people do this they are setting the next game up for failure.
Ive said this before  but it always seems to me that its women and white beta males that complain about this kind of thing. I remember years ago when hannah montana was the big thing  going to a halloween trunk or treat with my friends and their kids  and seeing so many little dressed as hannah montana. almost half of them were little black girls and everyone thought they were just as cute as the rest of them.
if they made a game set in a fictionalized india and 99  of the characters were indian  no one would be complaining that its not diverse enough. if they made a game set in a fictionalized ancient african kingdom and 99  of the characters are black african  no one would be complaining that it doesnt accurately reflect the modern world. but set a game in a fictionalized medieval europe with european people  read  white  and suddenly youre racist because there isn t enough diversity and it doesnt match modern day europe.
Imiss the Bible verses
stunning melonie.  knocks it out of the park again.
these people are miserable to complain about everything.
final fantasy 16 looks like they re doing a medieval theme to it. as long as the gameplay is good and the story is good as well Im okay. besides never really cared about the ff diversity shit.
modern subversive social  theories  confused a lot of people who weren t taught to think for themselves.  empathy destroys the entire representation argument but the goal is to divide people based on  race and gender.
Im hispanic I dont see a problem I just want a story
I love how developers of escape from tarkov reacted for woke complains about female characters missing in the game. i...we discussed it for a very long time  but we came to the conclusion that women cant handle that amount of stress. there s only place for hardened men in this place.
easy reason  triangle trade never happen in that world
its the same damn thing as with ff15 all over again  where the creators had to explain themselves to dumb ass  progressive  and  inclusive  and  tolerant  western game journalists why the ff15 character party is made up of all dudes  and had a great response about how the dynamic between all male characters was going to be different than with a mixed cast where someone would probably have to filter themselves  and thats what they wanted to explore.
lacks diverse characters  thats a win in my book! hats off!
you said your an introvert.   are you a intuitive introvert   I ask because thats what I am and if you are you probably know we are a very rare personality type.   also I watch glen beck and I gota say you are a lot easier on the eyes...just say n.   stay grounded  we love you.
unpopular opinion  Im more interested in playing a game about a cat who gets lost in this futuristic world thats populated by robots. but at last that game isn t available for xbox.
good vid siski
@chandler burse  well youre right. though their army propably dont have females.  game speaks for itselvs and all kind of people ply it including woman.
game thats while being a fantasy is still granded in reality and respect both culture and history of content which its based on  horrifying
the articles about this stuff are just ragebait. ff creators will just ignore it anyways this is going nowhere.
these misanthropes wanna turn videogaming into a powerpoint presentation.
a lot of ff games have plenty of characters of other ethnicities. and even other species still tifa and others got censored so it is a double standard woke politics of a small minority who do not matter we buy and play games and do not listen to these egotistic activists who think to rule our lives
yea  square enix already wants to leave japan  let s piss them off in the us too
when the shrines broke last year in japan at the tsushima islands  people donated almost 5 times the amount the priest needed to rebuild the shrines. its because of that game people  cared about the shrines  cause they learned it from a game. also the game being praised by japanese critics  and they re harder to please than western critics. I honestly dont see the problem here. only if the game actually managed to racially discriminate like the old times  would I agree  it didn t.
something I really hate is this new idea that people  for some stupid reason  think is a valid refutation of fantasy. specifically the  you ll believe in dragons and magic in fantasy but not   insert ethnic minority   . like bro  its not rocket science. if you borrow from the real world  real world rules apply. if your world is inspired by a real life culture and is a fantastical version of that culture  the people within the fantasy will resemble that culture. final fantasy xvI s world is heavily inspired by european mythology and folklore  thus the citizens within the fantasy world resemble europeans... who are white. if a fantasy world is based on african mythology  there will not be white people. fantasy is not an  anything goes  excuse to put whatever the creator wants. the purpose of fantasy is to convince the reader  viewer or player that what is fake in our world is real in this fictional world. a good fantasy world is like looking through a window into another reality and that means internal consistency of this fantasy world.the final thing I want to say is that this is the greatest example Ive ever seen to support something Ive been saying for a while   this isn t about inclusion  this is about control.  something that is hilarious about ffxvI s controversy is that there hasn t been white people in final fantasy before. everyone in final fantasy is japanese with barrett and sazh being the only black people. maybe there s some characters Im forgetting but white people haven t been in an ff game. if it were actually about inclusion  they d be celebrating but they re not. its just about control.
its understood that anime characters are asian. different color hair is to tell characters apart.
representation matters. ofcourse it does  to say otherwise is simply wrong. but shoving reprisentation in when it dosen t fit is not only jarring it comes across as pandering and insincere. not everything has to represent everyone.
who even is looking at the media for role models and representation   thats so stupid. think for yourself.
german games-magazine  pc games  posted about this on their facebook-page and german players are also commenting about that they dont want forced diversity in their beloved japanese franchise.
tell y all what  I fking love being white. love it.
how come nobody cared about the  diversity problem  in all these forms of entertainment until they went mainstream  did they not have these problems back when they were nerd interests  its almost as if either no-one gave a shit until they started making bucks  or getting popular turned them  problematic  somehow. hmm. Im sure its all a coincidence.
I finally bought a ps5 since next year so many games coming out only for next gen this is one for sure I love ff. Im so sick of the wokies they can just go fk off.
so  final fantasy has always been very diverse. Imean there is so many other actual races and species of humanoids. its insane how people are freaking out over a japanese company having too many white people in a game that has a ton of diversity. not that it actually matters. people are crazy.
Ive literally never finished a final fantasy game but Imight buy this anyway to support the studio.
amazing lol
I usually agree with you mel with your other videos but this one gonna have to give you an l I play alot of games and have played alot of jrpgs and tbh it gets a bit annoying always seeing pale skin  blonde  blue eyed characters all the time. though yes the whole diverse checkbox is cringe  I am saying I think  most people who have darker skin are saying it would be nice to see more characters especially playable ones that have the same skin tone as us. its not narcissistic as you claimed its just nice to kind of have character s  that I can visually relate to. I play games for fun and good gameplay and quality but again would be nice to see more skin tone than just pale skin
go boom!
Im still so shocked people choose to read yoshi-p saying he wanted to make a story based in medieval europe to mean he wanted to make a story with only white characters...when in the same interview he says that valisthea is a diverse land  just not as diverse as modern day earth on account  of you know  the lack of fucking traveling technology in medieval times. honestly  I would be surprised if any of the kingdoms even have a fleet of boats  since itsounds they are all too focused on their hate boners for each other
.
ff xiI was the last ff game I played.  x-2 was a horrible jpop disaster  luckily my local used game store has a policy that you can exchange a game within 24hrs for another game.  I dont like how rpgs are becoming more focused on the online thing.  it wrecks my heart that dragon quest went totally online after dragon quest viiI  best game in the series.  ff xvI looks pretty dang good.  Imight actually get it when it comes out  if its on pc.  no way I ll buy a ps5 or xbox.  just dont like modern console games these days.  they are either woke  boring  or broken.
I agree with you
all the best character in history were written as people. period. the gender  racer  and sexual orientation has always been a secondary thing. when a character is written as just  skin color kid  they are not a good character. when a character is written as just  gay kid  they are not a good character. if the ffxvI characters are written as people with interesting back stories  then they can be any race  sexuality  and gender.
if you dont like it dont buy it  but have the common courtesy to allow other people to enjoy it without all of the drama.
thank goodness. at least one triple a game. is resisting the wokie   agenda.  how d that work out for the former saints row franchise.
tbf the anime example is kinda shit because its drawn in a style that for the most part doesnt allow for categorization into races  but allows everybody to project themselves into the characters. a better example would be squid game  which can drive you to tears even if you are not korean.
square enix might say they care about the overseas audience but they hire japanese for game development  I do not get what they aim to do.
know what I find amusing right now  the fact kotaku and other publications are getting mad at ffxvI not being diverse enough for their tastes  essentially meaning has black people in it because they dont care about any other form of diversity ... when ffxv was the whitest final fantasy game that had ever released since the original 6 titles.  so... yeah I guess its because of the current year and to gain attention for ad revenue is the desired direction   because I didn t see anyone make a fuss about everyone being white in ffxv back in 2016.  oh and btw...there are multiple black npcs in final fantasy viI onward  notably two ladies at the beach resort cloud hangs out with who are friends of barret   final fantasy viiI  2 characters at the training center   final fantasy x  final fantasy xiiI and final fantasy xiv  they are all minor characters.  there are however roughly 8 to 12 major npcs in the titles from 7 to 14 who are black as well as two very important playable characters  that being barret and sazh katzroy  but again none of these publications care about all that  they only care about making divisive topics to gain traction or attention so people will go there to check out their hit piece so they can make ad money.  they know this would cause drama  they know this would be divisive so it will give them attention  get them clicks  make them money  from people who jump up and down with big pickets to people who are angry and bigoted reacting negatively  for them it is all profit   what absolute idiots  they re playing with fire to keep themselves warm without even thinking they could burn down their house as a consequence.  modern media everyone!
american sjw  yo japanese guy! you think white people are diverse japanese guy looks at everyone around him in japan  yep.
Im looking forward to a diverse casting of the third black panther film. Im thinking justin bieber as the titular black panther. super diverse. he s even disabled! Im sure all the sjw s will have absolutaely zero problem with non-black representation in a black panther film! none whatsoever.
if the woke mob hate it I love it  I will pre-order for the first time ever.
we cant see the blacks! its racist!  anyway I ain t been represented since red xiii. but I didn t really use him much.
in all my yrs of gaming  reading manga and watching anime  I have never questioned why there is a lack of brown ppl. I dont care most of the time. I dont stan characters for their ethnicity. these ppl would have lost their minds in 1992 when balrog was the only black guy in street fighter and a villain no less.
modern audiences .
those who focus on demographics  race  gender  ethnicity  orientation  age  are bigots. those who focus on character development regardless of demographic are story tellers. people first  demographic... um maybe 5th or so. let s see  person-hood  personality  motivation  goals... yeah ok maybe demographic next  although if I thought about itsome more Imight come up with other characteristics that are more important. focusing on demographics is focusing on the lowest hanging fruit.
this will make sure game sales hit big numbers
as someone said you can win against idiots..
these activists are seriously crazy. a few years ago  a game called kingdom come  deliverance was released  depicting medieval life in central bohemia around  year 1400. at that time  there was no diverse composition of the population  in fact  its practically not like that until now - I live in that region  we only have a stronger community of vietnamese  . these people criticized and boycotted the game and were surprised that there were no people of different races in medieval central europe and that there was a traditional position of women as a mother in the home and homosexuals could not express themselves  therefore they do not have a strong representation in the game. how can anyone be so stupid and not understand that the heavily Christian based medieval european countries just didn t have this  how hard it must be in america now.. I dont envy you at all  itseems to me that life is much better here  even though a war is raging just a few hundred kilometers to the east.
imagine being upset about inclusion.
God  I love this woman.  someone s making sense
well final fantasy is like an anime honestly since they have all sorts of races of characters and really out there characters that arent even possible in reality.
@thepsychomagus  some are  some aren t... ff10 had a main character with distinctly asian look as far as I cantell. the ones before were limited in graphics but resembled anime  sure.but the point is that anime for the most part doesnt convey racial information since eyes dont match for any race.
quick patch my the game with all japanese characters.
this conversation was over in the first minute as soon as you said the story takes place in medieval europe.  done!
so now they want to  destroy  final fantasy  lol their lack of creativity is huge  nothing original from these people  just trying to influence the company that creates those amazing stories to  educate ... for once I would love to see what they can create on their own  and lets the work of others in peace. but I feel like they cant.
thing is  that ff is an anime style game form a japanese studio. the japanese kids  who are going to be the majority of player base  find pale skin and big eyes appealing. same thing what happened with the ghost in the shell movie adaptation with scarlett johansson. she got the role  because she fits the bill for the target audience... japanese teenage boys.if you dont find yourself represented  possibly you are not the target audience. this thing what western studios need to get back to. define a target audience what you want to cater  and just communicate that  some people might find the lack of diversity offensive .way better than the current trend of trying to appeal to everyone based on a checklist in the hope of getting better sale figures. doesnt work... the players just get an unimmersive mess  like a transsexual biological female  person of color  leading a viking raid.
the people upset about this wont buy the game in the first place  representation or not. why would you want to write about something you dont like  these  journalists  dont seem to like games very much and focus on things in games that dont matter to gamers. they dont talk about gameplay or graphics or story  just skin color and gender. they re the ones obsessed with inequality  its like they crave it and will fabricate it whenever it isn t present. let s not forget the journalists hate people who play video games too. funny how many people dont like gamers but want to make money off of them. its the new trend in selling  hate your demographic and demonize your consumer base when they dont want your garbage.
so people who weren t going to buy the game are complaining about it lol
a bit high brow  but this is the remnant of constructivism. this kind of attitude towards art. constructivism was an art movement - so to speak - that was born in the ussr. every piece of art had to be made to inspire people about the ussr and so on... everything else didn t do well - so to speak. in essence  it was a tool of propaganda and the only artists that made it where the ones that made everything about  how great the ussr is . a lot of sjws or whatever they are called  now got indoctrinated into socialist  marxist or communist ideas. so  when telling an artist you have to  depict whatever here  for the sake of some movement or cause  is basically  constructivism.constructivism is a stain on art. but there is something people also forget about games. games are just not  art . modern day artists do things for their sake. for the sake of art and so on. the art and patron kind of mentality is now on the realm of designers. games are about designing. these characters dont get just 3d modeled. there is a concept phase that goes through a variety of variations. God  the entirety of the research for art direction at times has more history or inspiring pieces of film  for color  form  lighting  structures... this is by design.and by design  this game is not meant for tat tiny audience that would complain about anything because  from the get go  they dont give them enough money for the studio or publisher to care. their patrons  so to speak  are not these sjws  because they never were. and  it doesnt work. blizzard literally has an algorithm to spew diverse characters because that is all it is  a variety of checkmark to fill in. a program can do it... in any case. good on this studio for actually doing their research even. that part of design is honestly one of my favorites. way to go. I will be getting it.
20 years agp when we saw a movie with black  white  asian people or with a woman for a lead we did not care.we just enjoyed the movie... for some reason nowadays they want us to only care about these things. why
this is a game made by japanese developers so their game is actually 100  diverse since its all white people in the game and not japanese people.
the irony is its people who are not from that race or culture who complain about representation   cultural appropriation.its not just narcissism for the most part  its moral arrogance. trying to save people from problems that dont exist.
the game will make ten dollars less lol
I was just saying the other day about this that I hope japanese devs creators in general never bend the knee to these morons who think they can bully others in to being  inclusive   because I feel like games and anime from over there are some of the last forms of entertainment that are mostly untouched by woke garbage and identity politics. you can watch or play and relax knowing you dont have to always wonder about an agenda always being injected into things somehow.
look at anime and other video games asians represent themselves as white  the main one that doesnt is the yakuza series
like 90  of ff games have always been all japanese people. if you need characters to be diverse to enjoy something  than I doubt ur a ff fan. there s only 2 black  named characters in the history of the entire franchise. there s never been middle eastern or polynesian or latin as far as my memory goes. oh wait I think wakka was maybe polynesian. but still.
this is why I tell woke people they re not fighting for equality. fighting for equality does not mean kicking white people out of everything. equality means if its okay to make a game about all japanese people  then its okay to make a game about all white people.
imagine they replace all characters with crappy skin colour pallets and go say  this is what you guys wanted right. more diversity right
that is the kind of  criticism  that makes you think the game may be worth playing!
when ff 1-9 was white   nobody cares
so  let me get this straight  a person of colour made a game whose primary audience is japanese and thus people of colour and his ancillary market  the west  is giving him shit for being a racist because he wanted to make a fantasy inspired by european medieval history   remember when ghost of tsushima was a game with a 100  representation for people of colour  and they accused the developer of cultural appropriation  ironically people in japan s response to seeing a western developer making a game from japane s history was to buy thatshit up to make it a number one hit in japan!  the goal isn t to get representation as claimed it is to attack all media to make it political  so we have no refuge from the political.
as a longtime ff fan  ff stopped being good art 12. and 12 was  meh  at best  and I actually enjoyed 12
japan is such a unique conundrum for the woke to try and influence  the country has a set society with its own values and traditions which are far apart from a woke persons ideology and on top of that  japan is populated heavily by japanese people  they dont have many other races living there  who only speak japanese  so good luck to english speaking people trying to infiltrate and influence japanese people in japan. the only thing that could make the japanese change is if their money numbers decline which I doubt it will  which just proves that woke people dont even buy the stuff that they try to change
@highbudget  great point
the director for ff16 is the same man that was able to take ff14 from being the game that almost ruined the company to the most profitable mmo out right now. so Im really looking forward to anything that he s apart of.
thanks for telling me! this massively increased my interest in it!
ffxvI or ff16 borrows inspiration from the world of ivalice of ffxii. so you can enjoy ffxvi
I self identity as a cow so the only video game I can play is world of warcraft........
wonder why wakanda forever isn t getting flack for lack of diversity. guess it doesnt apply if the 99  of the cast is black   I have no problem w wakanda forever s diversity quotient because thats the story!!!! its about a hidden nation of people who happen to be all black. as a white person  this bothers me not cause I dont deem the quality of a film or show based on whether it not I see people who  look like me  in it. I actually just judge the quality of the work on the actual story and content of the film. crazy.
I hate wokeness my God  hope they all fall asleep .
as a black man who grew up in the dbz era  if people only relate to a character because they look like them thats a shallow comparison  identity is more than skin deep  I dont get why people cant enjoy a good story without bringing up race all the time.
I love this game and clive rosfield is very handsome beautiful so happy to play as clive rosfield. thats not an excuse to boycott a beautiful game with beautiful handsome lead protagonist.
the woke battle cry is racism every time
here s a game with a new lore  magic  battles  and the question was  do we have color people in it  then they wonder why we reject these gaming journalists
wait  so I cant be a good fighter like bruce lee because Im white    nooo
clearly the game needs more moogles  al bhed  ancients  galbadians and elvesoh wait thats not the diversity you mean  why are you trying to appropriate fantasy culture ! !
this reminds me back during ffxv release where people complained that there were no female playable character. people just want any reason they can find to complain about something. Im definitely going to be buying this game now just to support the creators. I still need to fire up ffxv on my ps5 and finish ffviI remake. Im so behind.
you got brain cells use them
if I was yoshi-p my only words would ve been  deal with it.
listen  sjws are abandoning twitter now  and the numbers that remain are low. sqaureenix please dont listen to these trolls   just make a fun game with cool graphics and and a good story.
I dont go to see a movie or anything to see myself. who tf does that   I wanna see and read shit I cant be or do. isn t that the whole point
final fantasy as a franchise has always been predominantly white so this is nothing new. we know how the asian community feel about black and brown ppl. they aren t interested in creating a narrative that includes other than white. they believe whiteness is the pinnacle of beauty. its been this way since the beginning and this is the first time they have been openly criticized for it. after 16  installments I would question them too. is it racism  not necessarily but asians sometime view minority populations as low class. so you gotta wonder
nice vid
I d also like to point out that there s no way  fans  are complaining about this  because the fans actually know what final fantasy characters usually look like. guess what  they usually look exactly like the characters in this new game  they have for over 20 years. shocking.
I just hope square enix doesnt think these people represent the perceptions of most of us.
wouldnt it be more accurate to say these characters be asian tho
first of all  I love final fantasy in general and Im eager to play ffxvi. I also disagree with people saying everything should be diverse. there is room for any kind of stories and there is no problem whatsoever european-centric ones.but I also disagree with you who thinks the love for representation is linked to narcissism. it is deeper than that.when your story involves a whole world and several cultures  it is just weird to not have any diversity. it is ridiculous   even.  it wont prevent me from playing but its a con.also  creators in this industry do target their work to please the players. thats the reason why ffxvI is action oriented  for instance.so im quite pleased the producers were asked this question because maybe in the future  they will consider it. for the sake of having  better lores and because a part of their international audience will be pleased by it.it doesnt take anything away.
that was something that was really surprising to me as a white guy  not in a bad way. I remember looking up dbz reactions on youtube and seeing how popular it was among black people. its honestly pretty awesome.
if you dont like it  just make your own square enix.
Im pretty sure these woke morons just assume that these characters are white. Ive seen people ask why all the characters in anime are white. thing is most of them are japanese. just because you think kenshin is white  doesnt mean he s not a japanese man in japan. over in another ff title  Im not even sure if ff7 s cloud is white or japanese  but that may be the point of his design. and frankly  I dont care. Ive loved characters in media that had nothing in common with me.
question  how do you call a japanese game white when the majority of characters look asian-designed  just different shades of skin  yet its all still in a fictional world where america  japan  europe  africa  dont even exist. now Im talking fantasy games like final fantasy and every other that matches it in its creativity. even if  by the maker s choice  add in some actual european-type characters  african-type  etc  in the end  they all speak japanese  until they become dubbed in their respective launch countries  how can you deem that white  now did Imiss something  please let me know.
dont know  square enix isnt exactly about fans first. I think they said they want to move focus on west. it could mean  that they will move to this crap  modern audience  nonsense. lets see.
a japanese developer is getting railed for having too many white people in their game.Im progressive  but I just dont understand what arguments for representation are even talking about anymore. aren t white people...people  canthey not be represented I understand the argument from the other side about a lack of representation for a slew of demographics. I agree  and there s been a massive correction for that in media. but that doesnt mean an all-white cast is somehow racist.I think it would be racist  in my view  to say that.would they say the same thing about not having enough blacks or latinos in japanese films  what about malaysian representation in bollywood the argument becomes absurd at some point.
mel you forgot to mention tomb raider in today s video. I was waiting to see how you would work it in. was a little disappointed.
if you need diversity in ff14  you have an option to make your own character - avatar  any shade you d like so you feel included and represented. enjoy.
japan is 98  japanese asian demographically. Im curious what the argument is  for making content match the demographics in a given population. do people realize that any kind of quota  is in and of itself  racial exceptionalism  whatever the proportions shake out to be  in any produced material  shouldn t matter. stop imbuing intrinsic value into things that dont objectively have any.
Im pre-ordering final fantasy 16 simply because they didn t put  diversity  first. they put the game first. take my money!
diversity is our strength   might be a nice slogan  but the truth of the matter is that multicultural countries have enormous problems. this includes countries that were monoracial and are now are multiracial went from relative peace to great upheaval. kind of explains why there are so many countries in the world.
you laugh at  diversity checkbox   the bafta awards essentially demand this for your product to even get nominated...
dont get me wrong. I think this game looks terrible. nothing but dark rooms with flashy effects. it looks like its going to be the pinnacle of key jangling entertainment. a chaotic  electronic mobile for babies.however. never would I demand the game makers to change it for my own political beliefs. I would ask them to return to a time when final fantasy was about the heroes being on the side of light  or life  or hope  or rebelling against a tyrannical empire   you know. fighting the evils of the world  not being them.  and I wont buy this game  even as a long running ff fan  but I would never demand they change their vision to please me. I d ask  even passionately  but I would never demand it.
I just gotta know are you into metal or a rocker chick
stories should be logical and true to lore or history.  I have no problem with games movies related to africa only involving blacks  same as I expect games movies about ancient europe to involve only whites.
lols just lols
the game needs a colorful cast of every of the 37 genders  and preferably only 1 cis white male.
I had no idea they were making another final fantasy game...
apparently every planet has to be diverse even if all the dna on the planet is the same
there are like 5 people in the world that actually complain about this crap and the rest are bots. why any of these companies respond to this stupidity is beyond me.
its european medieval fantasy... these weirdos from twitter and tik tok...
final fantasy 13 had a person of color in it.
@hurricane7  I know. my point was I dont understand how final fantasy can be slammed for  whiteness.  or at least xvi.
yes and yes
yes  and make him a trump-like main antagonist.  p
this game isn t woke its medieval. and its not woke!
they can be all white  all black  all asian  all indians  everything they want I dont care I just need a good scenario
im writing a book dose it have to have those elements modern audiences.
Im so tired
fuck. I dont even play final fantasy and ill buy their game just because they didnt cave to the bs.
it easy for someone to complaining. then it is to understand or to work hard for something. I think society should be separate from games.
if they have a problem with the game they shouldn t be looking at it
gee I wonder which race complained the most.
the property is created by poc.... lollike when scarlette played the major in  ghost in the shell   asians were like  thats fine  I dont see an issue with that .
hasn t gone over well with the franchise s fans. these people aren t fans. they are casual weekend levelers. they likely never played a single ff save for the mmo. gtfo of here and stop trying to change our franchise.
saying that these  everything must be diverse  people have brain cells is a stretch... just saying.
good thing for japan. they dont give a rats ass. they been vocal about it in anime stating in their own words about those that cry about such things. like the rising of the shield hero
when I was a kid  I wanted to be liono from thundercats and wield the sword of omens. judging by todays crazy logic does that mean that I was under represented  cos you know being black I feel there should be a black liono.  you couldn t make this shet up and why  cos you dont have too! the world has gone nuts.
the people complaining aren t even fans. just losers on twitter needing something to cry about.
but we know that the woke people wont be playing the game
me playing persona 5   where s all the black people at
go boom
large assumption that they have brain cells
if your first question is  are there any people of color   then you are not a final fantasy fan.
I didn t know any of their characters were white.
I like your hair
yeah that was a stupid question  they can diversify or include new poc characters in ffxvI sequel. Imean ff games were always diverse remember in spira had southeast asian with russian inspiration  everyone lived a primitive life after sin was defeated the nuns became singers  and news reporters in spira.
where is my none binary gender rabbit with a wooden leg and a glass eye with a fish in it for final fantasy xvi
we allready had alot of black characters in ff such as barret in ff7 they dont have any arguments or  excuses 2 complain
just look at the black character in ff13. they really want more of that lol
I think they need to look up the meaning of diversity before they use it.
love you
do listen to twitter  its not a real place.
we should just stop listening these people.
the reason ff16 will suck wont be because of the color of their skin.
the kind of people moaning about this dont even play these games or games in general. unfortunately square enix s finances are in the shitter except for ffxiv thats carrying their pocketbook. yoshI p cantell the esg sycophants to take a hike.
its kind of crazy to me how people have allowed this kind of questioning to be normalized in media.  if you only talk about skin color  and see skin color  your the racist.  - some person on the internet.
Im not sure if anybody s really watched a lot of anime or red manga or watch japanese movies and stuff like that if you notice they always try to make their people as wide as possible and stuff because thats what they consider is perfection most people dont understand this but when the japanese draw an anime things that is what they view as perfect beautiful people Ive read this in japanese magazine explaining why they have so many people in their animations that are not japanese and have silver hair and stuff like that because they find people with light skin beautiful not saying that they like white people or anything like that but the lighter  your skin the more beautiful you are the mind you you have to look like you are asian you have to have the slanted eyes and the chubby cheeks because all animation that Ive seen so far the most beautiful people they always have slanted eyes and with the men they have extremely high cheekbones and if the women they have a slightly rounded face and they re all light skinned doesnt mean that they are portraying white people it means they re betraying what the japanese culture sees as beautiful Imean look at geishas they use to paint their faces completely white they still do that what should we do should we call that white face because asians aren t white in the colloquial term of skin color yet they paint their faces up like albino people should we start controversy over this because thats culture appropriation right Imean people freak out when people do blackface why dont people freak out when people do white face what s up with the double standard it doesnt make sense in the complete total logical sense it doesnt make sense and the emotional sense I guess it makes sense if you hate people that are light skin than you are or if you have great amicinity towards the white people but you know what never mind that cant be racism because you cant be racist against white people because white people have ruled the world for millions by millions of years we re going to say the ancient egyptians are white too because they were rulers for thousands of years they were the great empire and they ruled the whole world how about the prince and the persians were they white people because apparently the only people that dominate the world and has ever enslaved people and were horrible to people and were stealing other people and stuff that apparently that was all white people mind you I am saying this in the sarcastic sense I am so sick of this race war when its not even when people just want to be left the f    alone and have the opportunity to pursue happiness.
well then  we need to change the 16th century. yup  thats what we ll do
what is wrong with people
yeah  Imean  look at all the backlash against black panther....oh  wait  nevermind
I love final fantasy  and one of my favorite games. theses people need to shut up about the race thing. I actually never thought of the character white just people
if you need to see yourself represented. look in a mirror while watching a show  cuz even if they are the same colour as you thats not you
word
my tribe.... oops Imean  group  has to be seen  heard and remain relevant in order to fight the continuous marginalization we face because its clear to us that obnoxious and uncivilized behavior nets positive results as shown in many examples throughout history and in no way creates situations where a society falls into chaos. sarcasmdo some individuals suffer marginalization of course.I wonder what percentage of people would remain in these groups if we separated the actual victims from those whose sole role in the group is warrior champion activist.who cares about the damage I am doing to a particular cause if I am getting attention... is pretty much how they behave.
boooooom
its whining. not slammed.
I never played that game. all I know of the character is that he had a baby chocobo chick.  I like chocobos so didnt think anything further than that lol
so they re are people of color in the final fantasy series as a whole  but I guess that doesnt matter to these people. final fantasy 16 is big sad because wah.fyI  you can blame ff xiv online for these weirdos showing up in the franchise. because I promise you they werent here before.
aren t the characters just asian though
sad part is woke is winning. newer japanese games are including freaking pronouns and body types..
I heard about it hypnotic s video  you dont need to remind me
miles morales the only puerto rican vg character. I cant relate to him at all as a puerto rican with parents born and raised in new york. I dont feel represented and dont see myself in him. nor do I care. who knew individuality is a thing.
true to history  what is this madness ! a dress  thats unbelievable
I thought they were asians haha
european people want stories about them
hI  melonie thoughts on netflix making a gears of war movie no no no
aaaand they just lost whatever points they earned for saying they were adding a  non-binary  choice in one of their other games. they shouldn t try to cater to the woke crowd in the first place. its a game they can never win. they should just keep pushing out the games they want to make and just ignore the whiny woke cries.
fun fact.  asian people think these characters all look asian.
Jesus and chill
this is ridiculous of all the developers they re gonna come at square enix and final fantasy  this is the same company whose last ff game stranger of paradise had a black party member and whose upcoming game forspoken has a black female main character
woke mob...
its a fantasy setting. its fantasy world is its own diversity.
bahahahaha
no one is ever happy
the talk of diversity  culture and orientation is getting out of hand really.... honestly Im black of color and I dont even enjoy diversity in movies and games these days...I just want to enjoy media content without an agenda to it
creators have to grow some balls and put their foot down. enough is enough. if I was the creator and was asked thatsnarky question  I would have responded   were there any people of color in 11th century england
I like it how the japanese dont give a f   . if this was european or american company they would have changed all the characters....  d
Im a huge gears fan  but man thats gonna probably suck lol!
mel if Imade a gears of war movie josh brolin as marcus fenix thoughts
@melonie mac go boom if it is done properly josh brolin as marcus fenix
@melonie mac go boom  me and my brother love gears but called it quits with gears 5. that one blows. we completed every wave on every  horde map on gears 2.
no  no fan has wondered that. idiots on twitter an resettera are asking for this kind of idiocy.
Im latin and I hate it  all I wanna know is who came up with this stupid agenda.
elden ring baby
eh  they haven t made a good final fantasy in twenty years anyway.
its just a game  they can do whatever they want to  give me a break...
I really dont get the problem  even when gaming was  racist and mostly white  I played as a woman all the time in games like tomb raider  mario is one of the most played ips in the world and not everyone is a short tubby italian plumber. like the point is playing as someone youre not. also dont fuck with nier  the games writing is the best in any media and I will die on that hill!
man you know what I do miss  the  yo quiero tacobell  dog  calm the fuck down people. Im hispanic.
Ive never cared for final fantasy  but this is ridiculous.  why cant people just enjoy what they want or leave it alone and find something else
itsmells like the same stuff  when they slammed white dude for playing japanese flute during concert for ghost of tsushima. little did they know he was is one of the few masters of this instrument in the whole world... clown world we live in...
I hope leftists dont look at the anime legend of galactic heroes then....
lamo  being  white  is hardly the problems with final fantasy at the moment. its mostly square enix keeps doing dumb choices  most of their games keep flopping so they really got to push that mainline ff title pretty hard.
ghost of tsushima is based on actual japanese historic evens and people. final fantasy isn t.
next they ll complain that a documentary about the klan isn t diverse enough.
I hate the woke agend now but square always needed this. ive noticed that theres no blk ppl at all in ff6 and below. only 2 blk ppl in ff7. 0 in ff12. 3 in ff13...
yet noone complains about  too much black people  in black panther.
loos like I ll buy it on pc and  ps5
I hate rpg games. Imight buy this just for this reason alone even if I never play it
time to repeat what we have been told   if you dont like it  dont play it.
nah shorty u missing the point  like your talkin about something that favorite you  so your not gonna see the bigger picture.
I didn t even finish video yet but like had to comment....its final fantasy wtf lolll not spidermanedit  Im further in the video and 100  melonie. honestly I wish eastern culture didn t blow up here simply for the fact there s so much sjw drama queens. Imiss the good ole days when I was a dork for liking anime and japanese culture.
you mean western culture.
making shitty games is totally okay tho
the problem is se wan catter to global audien so yeah dis happen they should know
this whole inclusivity angle made a bit of sense but anything in the liberal space seen at a  movement  is destined to go overboard and cannibalize the same people who push this ish. so tired of it  so focused on these checklists and the games end up shitty. black people aren t pressed to be in ff like this. japanese people are in a homogenized society true fans get there limitations and kno not to project this bs on everyone.
reeeeeeeeeee!
I really hope the woke nonsense it does not cross over into assassin s creed
omg theres always gotta be a problem doesnt there  if this japanese team made an all black final fantasy game that would somehow be racist and cultural appropriation. they just want click bait because theyre dying
final fantasy 16 is not for ppl who complain about shit like this it for ppl who want to play an awesome a game
this is absolutely ridiculous  people need to stop trying to ruin things that are popular. make your own shit and have itsell terribly.
lols  as if japan would care about these crazies
I like you buy ...
who cares what race people are theres only one race the human race we all human lets normalize that
I dont have a problem but. Im not playing a game were everyone is white and I dont even play fantasy
the characters probably aren t even white they re most likely japanese. does ichigo from bleach look japanese nope but he is 100  japanese fullmetal alchemist edward and al look white but they they are japanese I think final fantasy 15 actually does have white characters but for real instead of complaining about another creator s creation why dont people just go out and make their own make a game that makes them happy instead of whining all the time.
activists need to stay out of the gaming world literally
we need black and asian people in european mythos apparently  but we only need black people in african mythos or only asian people in asian mythos for some reason
ffxvI I hope continues to upset the outrage culture peeps. it usually means something is being done right
Im deff playing it now since people want to cry about it. so lame
you know as a black guy I never played   super mario  dragon quest or hell even chrono cross and think gee why isn t there more black characters  I swear journalist need to stop pretending to be  gamers
the japanese love white people and dont mind  appropriation . they re based
tifa ain t white.
these people are seriously racist. just let us enjoy the games!
and when square does have black people notably good black fathers who is doing everything for their kids and didn t go out to buy milk in sazh and barrett  which they also got ridiculed because black men cant make good fathers   idk.
I just want to be entertained with a good story.  not put out by a race topic.  ugh.
not white enough  I think.
you know  at this stage  im pretty damn happy about being white because it pisses so many people off.
dontlikeitdontplayit
there are black japanese people
get rid of esg.
rofl  I was not buying because Im sick of final fantasy being just a pretty action game   I ll stick to 14 and the older games. square deserves this  since they want that global audience.!
political correctness has destroyed the video game industry. I gave up on the gaming hobby a couple years ago. final fantasy was one of my all time favs though.
meh  I stopped being mad at japan for not knowing anything but stereotypes about black people back in 99. plus they still cant quite draw someone who looks like me without big ol  minstrel   black face  lips.
Im white and I could care less if I was represented I refuse to buy a playstation for an exclusive anyway.
you dont go to these movies to see yourself because you are the default. people like you dont even try to see the world from other people s perspectives.
forced diversity need to stop.
judging the quality of something based on the character s skin color  and nothing else  is . . . racism.  deal with it.
stop saying they were slammed. you have to have power to slam somebody. they were bitched at by annoying activists. there was no slamming involved. they were pestered.
final fantasy finally returning to its european medieval roots  blacks most affected.
they want control over final fantasy
uhg.... give me a conan show with tons of diversity. crom cares not for the zamorians  kush or aqualonians!!! he equally cares not for them.
woke ppl are the same as vegans in fact most of them actually are vegans   and when I say vegan I dont mean the ppl that just eat plants Imean the type of ppl that are  vegan  that have to let everyone around them know they are vegan with smug condescending undertones  hell sometimes overtones  and go to steak restaurants and get offended and make a scene because the steak house doesnt have a vegan menu  its because they think they are better than ppl that arent vegan truly they do ....its gives them the delusion of thinking it makes them  classy  like ppl that think drinkin wine or having money means  class
there s still hope for ff. the only game that is woke is ffviI  ffxvI isn t woke
@timmytimmy mit  I love final fantasy. if I pick up gaming again I ll try out the new one. still never finished 15 either. not a big fan of all the j pop looking femboys in final fantasy but I give it a pass because thats kind of a anime japanese gaming stereotype
this is a game  not a movie. also almost no characters look like me lol
@melonie mac go boom  I was responding  to what you said in the video. pointing out that this isn t a movie doesnt do anything. you know good and well people look like you in entertainment.
I smell a new villain...
the idiots complaining probably dont even know enough about videogames to realize that japanese people make final fantasy haha. and if they do know  isn t it kinda racist  one of their favorite words  to tell japanese people what they can or cant put in their games. so the complainers lose on all sides
final fantasy characters have always been 99  white  and people still loved the games
I dont know about  whiteness   but I dont like how this looks more like a western rpg. it doesnt really look like a  fantasy  game. to me at least
so an american publication is mad because a japanese developer wont put characters of african or latino descent into their european inspired game  sounds ridiculous.
Imean. the problem isnt the japanese games. its rather japan as a whole. everyone knows or rather should know japan are known to be covert racist and at the extreme against anything that isnt japanese or american. when it comes to colour. yeah t heyre known to treat people very differenlty based on youre skin tone. its a nation of covert racism
I wonder how much more people need to see before they realize its anti-white  not pro- anything else.
since when did ff have white characters  everyone knows they are just japanese people cosplaying like they are in medieval europe
and of course if they were all black these same people would call it a triumph of diversity and any complaints about the lack of other races as a racist attack.
people that care this much about diversity place value on people based on skin color. I ll have nothing to do with people like that.
imagine a game that visually is based off of european lore having white people in it........
some fans.  if you cant name names  then these fans are fiction of the writers trying to stir crap up. no real fan is ocd about diversity. devs need to tune out that 0.0001  and just focus on making good games.
well  with the success manga and anime are having  the woke see their propaganda-stained filth be rejected in favor of what the consumer really wants. no surprise they being butthurt over that. . to actually try to criticise a giant like final fantasy is just stupid. nowadays  final fantasy doesnt even need the west  as the asian market alone is huuuge. also  they might introduce a pet or mount of a different colour  so nobody has any right to complain.
why is this now becoming a problem lol I thought people loved this game. I really hope this woke shit goes away.
just watch when forspoken releases. these creepy nerds are going to go berserk with the negative reviews bc its a hot black chick who kicks ass and talks lol
didn t square enix decide to comment about how important it is to use the correct pronouns after adding  I could care less if they ad a non binary gender in the game but the fact that you virtue signal about it makes me not care if they get backlash for making a normal game
I hate representation  and diversity
itshould be slammed for being a console exclusive
its disappointing because its probably already finished
this is the kingdom come delverance argument all over again. something set in 13th century east europe didnt have black people. God. also...complains about ff16 and forgets that forspoken exists
racism goes both ways  you dont get to complain about too many white characters in a game while claiming to be against racism!go develop your own video game and make the characters whatever skin color you want and seek assistance in learning how to value people other than by skin color
@philI the gamer  - there s that  and then there s the bots they make to game the algorithm and make it look like its more relevant than it is.
capcom was criticized for having too many black people in africa in re5.
so cringe. final fantasy can do what ever it wants. ppl who want all these changes dont even buy the games. it doesnt need to be diverse unless they want it to be.
honestly people are just looking for things to complain about. they want to see problems where there are none  and create conflict.
ha ha your triggered
ellie is gay by the way
the developers are depicting a race thats not their own. how is that not diversity
what a bunch of whiners  just enjoy a good story and gameplay.  people who complain probably dont even play these kinds of games.
let japanese creators and all creators make what they want! Im so sick of these stupid complaints. if you want more  diversity  go make your own game.
Imean  I think its important to call out the racism against white people when we see it.
real talk. those who have issues on ffxvI diversity are wannabee wokes who hasnt played any retro snes or ps1 rpg games
well there s too many black people in black panther then...lol
I dont give 3f about diversity! if the games good has a good storyline  thats all it matters. if you dont like it because of that  then dont buy it!  that easy.
I dont know why western journalist want to insert every black in video game.its like  your game considered diverse only if you have black in your video game.so different ethnic  tradition  culture  race  belief  religion  and language is not considered diverse now  only black skin matter beside  I dont care if the game is diverse or not  what I want is a game with good story  great character and enjoyable gameplay
who the fuck cares about diversity in final fantasy . I swear  in every final fantasy  Ive ever played  there s only one thing I cared about  excluding the plot  is shiva    a summon  in the game
dont like it  dont buy it. bowing to this shrill online nonsense is what gives it power.
I dont whine and piss because of wakanda forever  why are tehy being racist with ff14
whiteness   just the word sounds racist af to me. replace it with blackness or browness and tell me Im wrong.
I dont want diversity and inclusion. its never helped me. and now its ruining my beloved game franchises. if that makes me a racist  then whatever. I really dont care at this point lol
I swore off final fantasy after how awful final fantasy xv was. never again. what a piece of trash that game series was. and considering they plan on adopting some of the things from ffxv  I wont miss it.
as stupid as people getting upset about too many black people in africa in re5... ridiculous
a small minority which no one cares about makes a loud noise which the majority should mute.
wok is just stupid game is just a game if you want to complane about the game create a game thatsuit you.
kind of insulting saying that medieval europe is not diverse because they are white. true diversity is in culture not skin colour.
you know this crap is ruining everything its ruining the mcu its ruining video games and if this offense just remember I dont care
crouching tiger hidden dragon didn t have an overweight black lesbian trans   cancelled

how many of the main characters are not white  oh thats interesting.... its just a movie  its just tv show  its just a school  its just a bus. can  its just  all day.  dont get offended because its true...
