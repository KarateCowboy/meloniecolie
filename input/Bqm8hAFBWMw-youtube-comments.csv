now I understand why the remaster looked and ran so poorly. they were too concerned about being woke. well  we all know what happens when you go woke  you go broke. thank you for sharing your thoughts and time with us melonie! also  hope the curly hair sticks around  very beautiful.
the golden age of humor is behind us. devs like rockstar need to hire people that know how to say idgaf when making games that are supposed to be irreverent.
@melonie mac go boom - it isn t about being offended over transgender dolls or anything else in particular  it is all about control. no matter what you try there will always be something to be offended over  and then they will jump on itso they get to control you when yourespond to them  then  when you have fixed the initial problem they will find something else to be offended by in order to make you jump to fix this new issue  only for them to move on and find new things to claim offence to. no matter what you do you cannot avoid touching on something that they can claim offence towards unless you either do nothing at all or only do exactly as they demand. this is how they control things. the only answer is to ignore them  or troll them like elon musk does.
the entire second half of this video really spoke to me. not only did I need the reminders of those rather famous verses  because  let s be honest  we re human  we forget these things in the moment   but the way in which you talked about them only reinforced for me how much we can really use them in our lives. thank you so much for all that.
what the actual heck..  this whole game is about drugs  sex and black humor. this is just beyond hilarious. if the gaming industry really wants to die on that hill  gamers will die out at some point  cause no one is up to that bullcrap.
rip rockstar. they ve become the corporate overLords that they always rebelled against. cdpr  first time
I know its been said  but it really is so refreshing to see a young lady not afraid to speak about her faith and personal convictions. reminds me to examine my own heart as well. thanks for all you do  melonie!
rs  we removed the potentially transphobic content so nobody gets offended what about the part where you brutally torture a innocent man crying and begging to see his children again   rs  oh dont be such a baby!
thank you for sharing your faith. I went to a Christian school and by the time I graduated I had stopped reading my Bible or going to church. its been a very long time but you got me to start reading the Bible again and Im starting to look for a church.
this is the woke world we live in  we need to fight that  those of us who see that they dont make sense have to speak up  which is why I am surprised in a great way and glad I found your channel
also im so excited that hayden is researching how his character has been developed. I like hayden  strongly disliked ep 2  but like hayden  and I love how anakin is depicted in the clone wars--if he can depict a mix of prequel movies anakin and clone wars anakin  he will be the perfect anakin
your commentary on your relationship experiences made me think of my friend.my friend his going through some major issues in his marriage and he has been speaking to a marriage counselor  unfortunately his wife refuses to join . it has been going on for over a year now. what I have learned from his experiences was that codependency damages every relationship. here codependency is defined as when yourequire someone else s words or actions in order to be happy. it is essentially being so attached to someone that you must get their validation or you wouldn t be happy. with codependency  if you dont get their validation  resentment take over and love gets destroyed. resentment is the most harmful thing in every relationship. in order to love  you have to have a holy detachment from them even when your love is not reciprocated. what this does is opens up your heart to have no conditions on the other for you to love them  and the effect is their actions and words do not disrupt your happiness because you have placed it in God.this is only true for marriage. if you are experiencing any major hardships before marriage those are red flags and marriage should be avoided. the only difference is my friend made a vow he intends to keep. he isn t innocent as to the events that led up to their major marriage issues but please pray he continues to grow closer to God and continues to try and be a better husband  and father every day. he is waiting with open arms to accept his wife back but it is ultimately her decision and all he can do it continue to work on himself with hope and prayer.
hearing about being single after 2 years is funny to me cause Ive been single for almost 2 decades. I tried dating but was told by 2 girls that I am unattractive and basically homely  my own nice way of phrasing it  and havent tried sense. I get along with girls fine but the moment I try to make any more advances  even as simple as going out for a coffee  I get ghosted. I feel like Ive done something messed up in a past life  I am a Christian and still thank God  often for what I do have  and am paying for it in this one cause I hear people complain about being lonely for a few months or weeks and here I am at 31 being without family and hardly any friends for a good minute. I guess its better it happened to me than some of these people that cant seem to go without.
when I think of violent characters  I think of people that wouldn t hurt my feelings. fictional violent characters are suppose to be our rolemodels.
found your channel via your appearance on  the critical drinker  channel. appreciate what you do  all the best to you!
I never even knew about the gta5 re-release getting censored  but then again I am not on twitter or any social media and there are hardly any good gaming channels on youtube anymore besides yours. thank you for reporting the news that is posted on twitter so the rest of us do not have to use that platform to find out what is going on. also I find dating in my 30s is much better because I am more mature and honest with myself about what I want and what I dont want. you are correct that it can be more complicated cause you dont want to waste your time with the wrong person  but I find that wasting a lot of time with people in my past cause I was worried about being single or hurting their feelings  was worse overall than just admitting early on that its not gonna work out. God bless you woman!
good to hear another game developer  devs of tmnt shredder s revenge  going the extra mile for the fans. the game reminds me of a tmnt game I had on the sega genesis.about rockstar. Im tired of hearing companies virtue signal with pointless changes. removing depictions of a toy  or a random npc that people might not even notice in their playthroughs  how would it help someone feel better about him herself to know that a random character or item  that may share similarities  was removed  all it does is validate removal of anything with the blanket reason  -phobia . validating censorship and control.pedro pascal saying he will avoid researching his role is just admitting that the character is not really the character  its in name only. someone could write a story about joel playing basketball with the globetrotters and pedro will just think thats something joel did. so many good actors played widely different characters and we never saw them as the same character  for example  gary oldman. without researching each character  its just going to be the actor playing the same character throughout multiple properties with different names.
loving the content and the host    someone getting frustrated to the point of venting is only natural.when we are being bombarded with  the messege  sooner or later Im feeling like Im under assualt and the natural reaction is to push back.everyone has a breaking point every action is eventually met with a reaction.I think the people pushing agendas are very much aware of that and are doing it on purpose.the whole woke thing must the be the single most fake  move  in history check out some of the movies and comics from 80 s and 90 s - every imaginable  representation  is there and nobody was making a fuzz about it one way or the other.the whole victimhood is artificially created by false narratives and exists only in the minds of those who believe in it by sheer faith alone  danyways Bible verses are a very nice touch  God bless!
love your content!  thank you for being genuine  I appreciate the good work.
the most disturbing scene for me was the torture scene.  I was offended.  but I d never want it removed.  simply dislike whatever offends you and move on.  btw  great channel.  found you through the critical drinker.  I ll watch him for movies and you for games
same for chrono cross. runs worse in its remastered mode vs classic mode. hey! at least with chrono cross in its classic mode is still uncensored. but it lacks antI aliasing to clean up edges. but at least its uncensored in that mode. its still a joke of a remaster though.
I dont think rockstar is going broke  but okay lol...
ran poorly because trans girls arent in the game    Im trans and all y all freaking out must have been j   ing to them or something to be this upset coming from a trans girl  your reaction is weird. I personally dont care if they re in or not lol why are you pressed and Im not  weird asf
wait what  lmao it didn t run smoothly because they removed npcs
@quinn mallory  right    lmao
people in the replies aren t smart enough to comprehend what you mean.
@litty lit  no but those remasters were terrible and sold horribly so go woke go broke for the product
personally if I was a gta dev  I would tell them every complaint makes us go edgier. im so sick of what game devs have become.
for real.
member when rockstar released creative original games while not giving a f@ck what anyone thought about said game s and if they re offensive etc.
@ogvelociraptor  man Imiss those times.
they fired all the original gta creators. lezlie benzies and sam houser or ben houser. I forget which brother left. I know lezlie benzies was pushed out and also lazlow left rockstar also. I worry for what gta will be like going forward. also bully 2 was put on the shelf because they are so scared of the backlash.
@w1llki11edsnake07  that explains the downfall and maybe its for the best they dont make bully 2 which would be filled with woke propaganda.
@ogvelociraptor   woke propaganda  because treating lgbt people as human beings is such a terrible thing amiright
why are u upset though that trans characters were removed as if its integral to the game lmao personally idgaf either way
they need to hire me fr
thats why doesnt matter what they want  say no.
oh dont even  cdpr is actually sticking with cyberpunk and fixing it  and its a first attempt at a new ip  as it took rockstar 5 years to come out with a game that cant even make a horse go round a bend properly  as atleast their game works and its getting better.
@kavinsky smith  all companies are open to criticism.even cdpr. they fucked out the launch  but I will give them a small portion for attempting to fix their mistake.
@ancestor empire  fair enough
@kavinsky smith  yep.
@kavinsky smith  I always found it funny cyberpunk had all this customization but no third person
@kavinsky smith  Imean  its not like he was being killed or tortured because of his race  sex  etc. not sure how people think its even remotely the same
@kavinsky smith  they hired modders for cheaper price to fix their game.modders.not themsleves.
@seriousdragonify  so  sometimes you need an outside eye to check for problems as your too focused on the ins and outs to see what is actually going on  which literally happens with everything under the sunjust check out mentour pilots video on malaysian airlines flight 134 if you dont believe me  and after your done check the commentsthe one by the sisyphean journal namely and have a good laugh at that lol
@kavinsky smith  you did not disagree with my factual statement.you just shot nothing with your reply.
@kavinsky smith  you mentioned different games that dont have anything with scamming everyone.going off topic with nonsense.how about you mentioned watch dogs  hm modders made that game better after ubisoft scammed people with their e3 gameplay.for free.but graphically only.the rest was taken out before release.
its ok. I guess trans people dont want to be included. so they ll just have to be removed from the game. no inclusion for them I guess
if any character in gta 5 is your rolemodel you need help like seriously
haha same. was like  who is this tomb raider girl
really great message with the verses off the day! I could feel my worries slipping away as youreminded me of some very great truths. thanks!
I love melanie s videos because the camera angle makes her look like a living   talking funko pop.
how can we bring even more fan service   amen!
great video as always. I watch mainly for the Bible portion of the video but Im also a gamer so its all good. Im at a point in my life right now where Im not sure where to go or what to do. life is just stagnant at the moment. I keep wondering what God has in store for me next. Im ready for that next step.
rockstar  in real life  has unironically become a studio that would fit perfectly in their roster of fictional  satirical companies.
the rockstar co-founder did say back in 2018  that he did not want to make gta 6 in the current political climate. so it doesnt surprise me they are bending the knee. while they did announce a few months back  Im expecting it to be vastly different than the previous  especially with what you ve shown. also Ive been waiting for shredder s revenge for nearly two years now  and I love seeing all that awesome footage. you cantell that the developers are giving that game all the love it needs. I cant wait to play it with a group of friends! with that and the trailer for sonic origins  today has been a nostalgia trip.
people have become so fragile these days. if I d taken personally every joke or criticism aimed at me I d have taken myself out by now  but I didn t and it made me a stronger better person.
drinker sent me.  typically I am a loner who keeps to myself.  here lately that has become impossible to just be left alone.  so I am here to show my support to those who are standing on the front line against the nonsense.cheers.
found you thru the drinker  you got another subscriber from me. anyone who speaks out against this woke nonsense deserves my attention.
looking forward to both  shredder s revenge  and  the cowabunga collection  when they drop later this year  myself! we all know how the newspeak works by now.  -phobic  means nothing now. you could blink  and you would be considered  -phobic .
melanie  highly recommend captivating  unveiling the mystery of a woman s soul by john and stacI eldredge.  glad youre taking an introspective look at you and your walk.  thats how you ll grow as a person and grow closer to him.
I know where youre coming from in regards to being all or nothing with someone you like. I turn 30 this year and in all that time I have only ever found two girls who I was really attracted to and really wanted to date. unfortunately for me neither one of them felt the same way about me but Im not looking for a girlfriend just to have a girlfriend. Im looking for my future wife. because of that Im also still a virgin and get so much shit from a bunch of guys I know for it but Im sticking to my guns.
your hair looks great! I stick to minecraft these days. no message - no politics. just builds and not dying while getting to the ender-dragon. then more builds. if anything  I try to find old games to play. most new ones just aren t fun anymore. a pity  really  but Im not wasting my time or money on something I do for fun.
rockstar isn t the same rockstar we used to love and know... its a damn shame...
and on another note  joshua 1 9 was exactly the verse I needed to hear today  so thank you and keep up God s work
remember what the mpaa says  horrific  deplorable violence is okay  as long as people dont say any naughty woids!
if rockstar are starting to pander to the left we re doomed.
saw you on drinker and learned about your channels there.  earned yourself a new sub.
saw you with  the critical drinker . subscribed and will follow your channel. thanks for your work. o
not to mention  the co-founder and most of the original people have long been gone from the rockstar games company if I remember correctly.
the most terrifying force of death comes from the hands of men who wanted to be left alone. they try  so very hard  to mind their own business and provide for themselves and those they love. they resist every impulse to fight back  knowing the forced and permanent change of life that will come from it. they know that the moment they fight back  their lives as they have lived them  are over. the moment the men who wanted to be left alone are forced to fight back  it is a form of suicide. they are literally killing off who they used to be. which is why  when forced to take up violence  these men who wanted to be left alone  fight with unholy vengeance against those who murdered their former lives. they fight with raw hate  and a drive that cannot be fathomed by those who are merely play-acting at politics and terror. true terror will arrive at these people s door  and they will cry  scream  and beg for mercy... but it will fall upon the deaf ears of the men who just wanted to be left alone.
hayden Christensen is the type of actor we need today.  he is old school due to his mentors.
thank you for your encouragement.
so in gta you can murder people senselessly  but you cant hurt a person s feelings.
keep up the good work  loving the hair look
they also apparently removed hookers from gta online as well I was playing with a friend last week and he always goes looking for them on his own
God bless you melonie
is it any wonder why I am so into retro gaming   back in the day it was about the game being fun  challenging  or at least engaging.  not about preaching by neo-puritans.
if rockstar has fallen  then nothing is safe!
I bet it will be an extremely crappy chopshop  remake  though the turtles game looks promising.  I wish you the best of luck in dating and I believe you ll find the one for you just give it time.
the people what sent rockstar a letter telling them to remove it dont deserve to work in the game industry
hey what you said about discernment and how God will guide us is spot on. I plan on starting a gaming channel and Im hoping to God that it will be successful  but its  not mainly about success its also so I can reach out and communicate with other believers  please pray for me if you can. anyways you have a blessed day.
I see this as a big win personally.
found you via critical drinker after hours. you just got a new sub!
aw  Imiss the days when the gta franchise was kept much simpler - please just bring back swing set cannons!!also - tmnt shredder s revenge  shell yeah!!! and boss move on bringing back the old school voice actors! much love to cam clarke  townsend coleman  rob paulsen and barry gordon! too bad there s the uncle phil-shaped hole  rip james avery. . .
damn  hayyden researched the clone wars  talk about meta. if only we had a time machine and had george lucas watch it too before making the prequel trilogy lol.
if we already knew what was around every corner... amen  to todays sermon.
have they ever played the game  have they ever seen the gta 5 community    Im dying to see how this turns out
did I zone out or did melonie make it through another video without mentioning tomb raider   through Christ we go boom.
this is exactly why Im hesitant to be excited for gta 6. if they bother to waste time retconning an existing game  then they will for sure pull this kind of stuff with future material.
I cant game these days  but Ive been going back and just rewatching old longplay game videos on youtube. and I find Im not watching the new stuff with photo-real graphics. Im watching the original 1996 tomb raider  perfect dark 64  ocarina of time  sonic the hedgehog 2... there is such purity and charm in those old early 3d games and 2d side-scrollers that the more polished new ones have never been able to recreate. I hadn t even heard of tmnt shredder s revenge until today  but thats the most joyful new game Ive seen in a long time. takes me right back to the movie theater arcade booth in the 1990s! God bless ya  melonie mac. boom!
Ive been playing on my wiI  wiI u  and new 2ds xl more than anything else lately because phuk modern-day video games.
@heywood jablome  I play old tomb raider on ps1  not gonna lie control are awful but I take pleasure playing with the true queen who introduced me to game
love that verse joshua 1 9  and psalm 23 you cant go wrong with
when is a new channel not new anymore  just teasing I enjoy your content ms. mac.
tmnt is like most franchises.  there is good and there is some bad.  need more good.and that one nes game is bloody impossible.  but I never stopped trying.
Im loving the new hairstyle
just shows how different mainstream aaa game dev was back in 2013  just 1 year before sarkeesian and the woke mob filled it with garbage.
yay. satire is being censored because of  hurt feelings.   Ive been telling people the rockstar went to garbage when both creators left.
well damn...now I cant beat them to death with bats....
I kinda wanted the tmnt voice actors from 2003  but atleast we re getting a new tmnt game. so I cant complain  I guess.
she has kind of that hot space girl vibe like gamora in guardians of the galaxy.
for an oppressed community  they sure do have a lot of influence.
can I just say I love your hair like this  you said you put no product in it but it has so much volume. what is this witchcraft  its beautiful.but with regards to drag queens  they ve been lumped in with transgender people  there used to be transsexuals and transvestites  but someone decided its all the same thing   so any criticism or  even  actual depiction of the ridiculousness some of these people put out there for other people to see is considered transphobic  therefore heretical to the new religion.
cut content is censorship. screw censorship.
I dont know who said that but   to know who has the power  look at who you cannot offend . this is something Ive always noticed whenever them activists start preaching about a new protected group in the most oppressedthe people of these groups are always more caring  more loving and understanding  more amazing yadda yadda  as if they were above us common peasants. Im not saying all trans people are like that  but the group pushing this ideology into media and culture sure are hype to welcome their new transgender overLords
2022  you can wear this shit in real life you cannot wear this shit in a video game
the turtles game adds april as a fighter. is there any precedence for this  before current era   feels like they are bending a character to the current crap.
can we please remember that video games are not real life  its ok to make jokes and have a laugh without being mean-spirited. I agree that itshould be all or none.
I feel like if you dont have gta v by now its fair to say you probably dont want it
dont forget they removed the confederate flag in the  ree-masters  of gta 3  vice city  and san andreas.2 45it d be nice to know aht rickey was saying  his audio was mute on our end xp
God is going to put a wonderful man in your life
I am. I have played the franchise since the gtaiiI . owned each one  beaten them and loved what gta brought to my gaming experience. they have always pushed the envelope  by poking at race  gender  political issues  and social stereotypes.
did she get a perm
@ogvelociraptor  its her natural hair  she usually straightens it
not having the original soundtrack for vice city and san andreas for the remaster is way more offensive than the confederate flag
@kickinthescience  oh sure thats bad too. Imean  if activision could bring back classic tracks for the tony hawk pro-skater 1 and 2 remakes  rockstar has no excuse

when everybody is being made fun of and you choose someone or a group to not make fun of thats discrimination. so now we have good and bad discrimination
removing content instead of adding content... well done r
gta is actually transphobic for removing these said characters.  suprised no headlines like that has been made.7 27 - 7 45 I literally have this same mindset . most of the drag queens there are men . the only trans character I know in gta 5 is peach and she is pretty cool. nothing offensive about her.
good news about tmnt  too bad they couldn t bring back uncle phil.
the woke would yell at the sun for being phobic to the cold. this does change the game. or at least the very mindset of players going forward with the gta series. if rockstar is going to go down this path now  God only knows what woke garbage is going to be in future installments. another case of a huge franchise thats destined to die
I really thought rockstar would be the last company to bow to the woke mob. what s most concerning is what this could mean for their future games. what are they going to not add because it might be  offensive  to some twitter activist.
here from your chat with will jordan  subscribed
gta makes fun of everything and everyone equally. I have no idea how they are going to do gta 6 because of how offended everyone gets about jokes nowadays.
when I saw these people in gta v on ps4. I didn t see anything offensive about it. its just our world is being way too damn soft.
@melonie  continue to wait on God.  he will lead you to the right suitable companion for you.  peace in him
its over. once rockstar pandering and bend the knees to these woke  power hungry  controlling headcases.gta couldn t become what makes the series great with their edgy witty comedy and intentionally offensive insults then gta 6 and so on is no longer worth buying.
the God in you is a software update we get that was released 2022 years ago codename holy spirit.  prior to that updates were through proxy s and stuff written on tablets but stuff were getting lost in the translation.  prior to that we were just talking but we stopped returning calls.  prior to that was a hardware scrub.  the way things are going we are due for an update.
if anyone was offended by gta then it did its job.  removing it is just ridiculous.
I think gtavI cant even be made this day and age. going to have to be like the new saints row reboot thing.
just to clarify  none of my past comments are meant to disparage you or your beliefs positions nor to disparage anyone as a person.nor do I think I know everything.as it pertains to biblical things  Im simply voicing my understanding from many years of studying both scripture itself  and the context of the culture it was written in.Im just trying to share what I have learned so it can potentially help others.I have nothing but love for you and I respect that youre using your platform to encourage people to follow Christ  or follow him more closely.
oh noes! the criminal murderers in our game about murdering criminals said some things during their crime and murder spree that could be transphobic!!do... do these people not grasp the idea that not every character is a role model  damn if youre playing gta and thinking that these guys have life down and you should be like them you ve gone seriously wrong on several levels. of course they re jerks. they re the bad guys. thats the point.
I know what the g   t stand for now  and between that and the online focus I expect I ll pass on anything from them including gta 6 and red dead now since theyw on t have the grit any longer that made them great and they ll probably wanna nickle and dime me to f cking death.
george orwell s  1984  is becoming reality. there is a paragraph that goes  every statue has been torn down. every painting has been repainted. every book has been rewritten. we live in a time where history is being abolished every day and the party is never wrong.  that may not be word for word exact but thats not the point. the point is its true and we see it playing out in real time.
wait  your single  how did a great catch  such as yourself  not find true love yet  if I knew you personally I would ask you out but alas
ricky is just an absolute unapologetic alpha superstud and the hunnies all know it.
the gta trilogy remaster was a very telling sign that rockstar would go in this direction! oh how Imiss the early 2000 s  those were the days of modern gaming!
also frizzy hair looks great!
he s the best lol
just had a discussion about the exact same topic... so why is it that  some  people get to decide what  negative depictions  of  trans people  actually are is it that  a few just raise their hand and decide for all others now  and just like melonie said  since when do  drag queens  automatically relate to transgender people anyway. did anyone actually think that gta in on itself is supposed to actually depict real life  no  strange isn t it... I bet you could take any single characterfrom that game and find someone  who doesnt feel accurately represented  or even  personally offended  by the depicted characters. so what  its not a documentary is it ! its fiction. its a game.  and just to raise a valid question  did the designers of the game actually intend to to portray certain characters to be intentionally harmful misdepictions  I hardly doubt that.its just sad that tolerance is becoming such a low valued virtue... especially by those who constantly  scream  for it.
and this is why I play military shooters like insurgency sandstorm and Im totally buying six days of fallujah yeahyeyeyeye
I do enjoy your thoughts on gaming  however I do have one criticism  well Im rather new to your channel  but there is a lot of mention of God  as an atheist I respect anyone s right to talk about whatever deity they worship  as long as they dont push it on others  it felt like a bit too much of it on a video  where majority of it was on said topic while the rest was about a verse and explaining about it. I guess what Im trying to say is that there were aspects to the video I enjoyed while the rest  I did not  it came off a bit preachy.
not a boomer  come from critical dinker.
so whatever happened to rockstar not caring about offending people with their content  gta has always pushed the buttons envelope in terms of offensiveness. I played gta5 online for a long time  ps3 ps4 era up until the new current head of r  decided to be a complete dick and make every new piece of content public lobby only   raise in-game prices to extreme levels so that you basically had to purchase shark cards or deal with an insufferable grind  more than it already was beforehand . haven t touched it in a good 3-4 years now sadly. it was a really fun game  back in the day.the tmnt shredder s revenge game is being published by dotemu  same people on board with streets of rage 4. that game was an absolutely fantastic love letter to the original three sor games and I have been binge-ing it over the past month. four player couch co-op is like the most fun Ive had in a hot minute. I have high hopes for this one.
goodbye rockstar  this is the beginning of their downfall. jokes on them though  I play the  ya rr  version of gta v so I ll always be able to recruit trans characters into my gang or use them to play as.
not a good sign for the future releases of rockstar....
I specifically remember a point in the game where you have to brutally torture someone   tied to a chair with trevor..........but a man that dresses like a woman is somehow more offensive................
I love your hair.
so the action figure with interchangeable junk is evil but a character who openly admits to cannibalism is completely okay  Imean neither 1 really offends me because its pixels and ironically trevor is my fav gta character ever! man people need to lighten up its a video game my goodness!
careful not to use God as an excuse for what is ultimately your choices. he gave you free will after all. past heart break or bad relationships can be causes for keeping  what could be decent  people at arms length. just some advice. Ive seen my sister go through the same thing.
6 52why dont you ask neutereddog when it comes to the last of us 2
john 6 40 and this is the will of him thatsent me  that every one which seeth the son  and believeth on him  may have everlasting life  and I will raise him up at the last day.our heavenly father made itso ridiculously easy that people refuse to believe it could be thatsimple.
couldn t hear what ricky was saying. did she have it on mute
I think now that we re moving in a respectable way to accept trans people I think they realized it wasn t the best way to bring trans representation to a video game. however drag queens dont look like that in real life so I see why some would be offended  it is a humor game however I think they wanted to represent that community in a better respectable way.
trevor isn t exactly a good guy is he  how are people supposed to know who is the bad person in the game if he isn t making fun of someone who doesnt deserve it. how will the next generation know what is good or bad if its not represented in a game.
lol. a gta for ps5 ad played before this video.
everyone is complaining about them removing  transphobic  nonsense from the game for next gen... but why are people not complaining about rockstar rereleasing this game for the twelfth time to take your money without giving us gta6 edit  girl  dating is overrated as heck. most people in the dating pool are a downgrade from being single. as for the religious differences in dating  yes  definitely agree. dating somebody is not of your faith  or respectful of your faith is nothing but a bad time.
I like how you give a very realistic view of what being a Christian is  I cant stand the  religious holy of holy mind set    acting like this angelic swan so to speak that fake act turns me off. I dont want be like that  I just want to try my best to be Christlike   not worry about messing up! Ive seen  quote on quote Christians  who are supposedly very  spiritual  all act exactly the same! and for the most part  I dont like praise   worship type music  it all sounds the same   I just cant relate to it  how about you
one thing Ive learned is that when you are lost wondering where God s direction is  thats partially a lack of faith. faith that in God s time you will be where you need to be. you may desire to serve so badly  but you dont have the big picture or know how best to do so. dont flail about in a rushing river  ride the current and watch for opportunities and study the Bible. especially ecclesiastes if you are in a place you can handle the heavy truth that nothing matters... in a sense. every human is infinitely important  but you dont matter any more than anyone else  you aren t the mc  you aren t the big hero  you are just a supporting character in the lives of everybody in your life and they are supporting characters in your life  so you should treat them as the mcs - we re all a team  the ones who are greatest are the humble ones who build up those around them and accept their supporting role.
thats how I run this channel  I understand if its not for you but I wont be changing it. many love my verse of the day segment  some atheists even. but hey you dont have to like it.
I clearly mentioned we can and still do make mistakes lol. but if we are actively seeking God daily  we will have discernment. whether we listen or not is on us still.
@melonie mac go boom  fair enough.
which verse states this freewill... God is sovereign right  he created all  knows all and controls all - the alpha and the omega.
@melonie mac go boom agreed melonie  may I encourage you... emphasize being continually in his word. thats when we know his will! rom 12 2
@brett small   the heart of man plans his way  but the Lord establishes his steps.  - proverbs 16 9                                                            and if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord  choose this day whom you will serve  whether the Gods your fathers served in the region beyond the river  or the Gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell. but as for me and my house  we will serve the Lord.  - joshua 24 15                                     behold  I stand at the door and knock. if anyone hears my voice and opens the door  I will come in to him and eat with him  and he with me.  - revelation 3 20                             and the Lord God commanded the man  saying   you may surely eat of every tree of the garden  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat  for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.  - genesis 2 16 - 17. free will was given by the sovereign  but your actions cannot always be laid at his feet.
its not that easy  faith without works is dead.
@mike garn  john 3  14-15 and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness  even so must the son of man be lifted up  that whosoever believeth in him should not perish  but have eternal life.this is a literal comparison to how he saved people in wilderness where they were complaining about their condition and sent fiery serpents on them and all they had to do was look away from their situation with the serpent bite and look towards the bronze serpent. Im curious how many people were foolish enough to not even bother looking.if you dont mind me asking what does baptism symbolically mean to you
@triumph  I cantell you literally I think too many people use it as an excuse to make bad decisions thinking they can be forgiven of it later. have you been skipping sections of the Bible  do youreally think faith on its own is sufficient  do you mislead people into believing baptism is a free ride into heaven  read the rest of the book.
@mike garn  I asked you what itsymbolically means to you specifically in order to gauge your beliefs. you dont need to be baptized to be saved just as the thief on the cross wasn t baptized  nor did he have any  works  but simply believed in Christ. I dont think I need any other information from you as the evidence seems to favor your faith in yourself which essentially means you are placing God in your debt in order to reward you.the response I was hoping for what that baptism symbolically starts with your death because youre in agreement with God s judgment on the flesh. the faith you have in Christ supplies you with the spirit which is eternal life and you cannot by your own effort live the life that Christ alone can live in us  which is why we live by faith that he will live in us. just as abraham couldn t produce the life God promised by his effort  neither can we. our effort to produce the  Christian life  by our own strength is no different than abraham producing ishmael and the true circumcision is those who have zero confidence in the flesh. if youre still hoping to produce a life that is pleasing to God apart from Christ then youre working for a wage and no different than the brother of the prodigal son who was trying to work for his father s favor rather than enjoy a feast whenever he pleased. I think the question you need to ask yourself is whether it is more pleasing to God when you fully trust him or whether he s more pleased with you striving to be pleasing by your own natural strength. but if you go back to what I said before with baptism  it begins with your death so you literally cannot do anything but trust him but most people refuse to believe that because they still think they have something within themselves to offer God rather than coming to him knowing they have nothing worthy to offer but the blood of Christ which covers their sins.
people did complain about that though.
are you saying that Christians should not date non-Christians  what if the non-Christian is converted as a result of the relationship  I dont mean by manipulation  but rather the non-Christian is able to see the light of God in the other which then sets them on a path to redemption. also  I think you will have to purposely choose to be in a relationship. God may put the right person in your life  but he s not going to throw them in your lap either. they will have their own free will  too.
you cantake out people with a car  but if you say one spicy joke. thats problematic.
hey good afternoon melonie I just want to say that I love and like to watch south park tv show too and I think that it is a great and cool show to watch. anyway I also love the characters on the show too. anyway I just want to tell you that gta video games are great to play but I dont like how they are bringing the transgender to video games and how they are destroying it with transgender people into video games too. anyway I wish that they leave video games alone and just move on with other things  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say bout that and let you know what my thoughts are on this topic  ok melonie. anyway I hope you had a great day today at home and at gym and I hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets  ok melonie. also have a good night too melonie.
ok first of all why tf do we even need a remaster of gtav in the first place  remasters make sense when its something like ff7 or another game that has a few console generations between the original release and the remaster  personally would love to see a legend of the dragoon remaster  but I dont think thats going to happen   but Im pretty sick of seeing these lazy ass devs remaster literally the last game they released in a particular series instead of actually developing a new game to get fans to keep on giving them money. but like  why bother if people will pay you for the same thing multiple times  I guess.people  please stop buying redundant  pointless remasters that no one asked for.
now im really worried for what gta 6 is gonna be about . most likely gonna be bad.
I notice the Bible talk starts about 1 2 thru the videos now  Im not a religious person and never have been. I gotta say  I only watch half the videos now. Im just not interested in the Bible  my life sucks and it wont change randomly.

wait till they find out about  saints row....
do these people not realize that trevor  michael and franklin are not good guys..... especially trevor
gta5 getting a remaster instead of gta6 kinda makes me mad. kinda like how mario kart 8 got mario kart 8 deluxe.
actually these people should feel flattered because most of them look way worse in rl than these alleged caricatures.
is it just me or people just soft these days  lol
melonie and I go boom boom in my room room
nice now I wont buy it!
the  transphobic  stuff was put in on purpose because its a satire game.
the one thing Im glad they removed was the obviously masculine-built men wearing underwear or panties  hooker clothes and had crappy make-up put on. those are the npcs some people are calling the drag queens  also shown in the video s thumbnail . its always made me feel weird and uncomfortable to see them.
6 15its called control. Im oppressed...dont you know that means you have to do everything I say
of course they did.    weak
thats why u beat them with a bat my guy
yeah but now I cant regularly run them over with my car.
le sigh
never thought I d see the day they became wokestar games... its gta  its supposed to be satire. so satire is offensive now
hI I am a righteous man walking in the faith of Jesus Christ God looking for a righteous woman walking in the same faith as i. I have also been single for some time  have met girls along the way but not what is right for me. in the city where I live in san antonio tx its very hard to find a woman thatshares the same faith also into working out and gaming like I am!
what is thatsaying that us 2a people say give the a milimeter and they take 1 million miles or something to that effect
gta 6 id doa. leslie benzies and dan hauser are gone. the series is dead. they were the heart and soul.
yeah think gta 6 is going to be a dud. too many people leaving rstar and too many rumors about it being in development hell with all this woke bs going on.
wait there remaking gta v why it the last game that came out. now I dont think I will ever get gta 6 if it ever comes out.
on the 69th day God  said what the crap when he accidentally caught  adam and eve doing the nasty.
in a game about the criminal life style i.e. robbery and murder not to mention the online version with flying bikes and cars people are getting offended by cross dressers in a video game yeah seems legit.
dont have hopes for gta6 neither red dead redemption 3.
nice tats
so its official rockstar games have gone woke and gta6 lead character will probably be a trans woman
yet not a single trans activist will even play it but game journos gotta rage about something
gta v is offensive to everyone thats the point. it is asinine to single things out to have an issue with.
rockstar removes  transphobic  content from gta 5 but you wont find anyone throwing a fit about the republican space rangers bits.
gta... a game that was meant to be offensive and riskay. glad to see rockstar lost their way and suck now
gta 6 will be so bland if they ever make one.
overcompensation to the left is inevitable. you cant compromise with those who wont because all you will be doing is admitting defeat. also we re not the one s who have being posting under our real names what we want to do to the other side  and how coexistence with people that think different than we do is impossible. other than choice of deity  allah vs. the state  there is no difference between the left and islam in terms of behavior.
as someone who s lgbt thats not transphobic lol bro
yes  they are offensive. if youre going to pretend to be a girl then you should at least look like a girl. if you cant pull it off dont try in the first place.
thats a lie. shredder is dead
its good to see you support the new zealand rugby team the all blacks by wearing an adidas top are you a kiwI deep down at heart
based on the thumbnail only - I haven t heard the content yet yes.  drag queens are offensive. -
Im done with rockstar forever. gta has never been and never was meant to be politically correct  quite the opposite in fact. gta 6 will be a woke disaster and will be the end of rockstar games once and for all. all this for a very small percentage of the population!
how is it not offending to hide transgender content away  its more transphobic to not joke about it and sweep it being a thing under a rug
fuck remasters and remakes. just pirate the original games. woke companies dont care about real gamers so show them the same respect.
this 26min video had only 7min of actual content  and the rest was religion. I think you need to be careful with that  cause it looks like bait and switch.
I dont want to see this crap in games anyway.
fine  fine   Im gonna keep sticking my sticky bombs to cis wahmen and little dogs then.is trevor still allowed to wear his dress
bro youre still wrong about this  hayden Christensen played the original part in movies so its like him brushing up on his old material pedro pascal still going to do a great job because he wasn t the original character and he s not trying to be the original
first
all the people in the comments mad that they can no longer derive entertainment from minorities being disrespected   y all continuously expose yourself
you are absolutely right. the last rockstar masterpiece was rdr 2 and dan houser   all rockstar game writer   just left after that. he probably didn t want to associate himself with all these pressure from take 2 to write a politically correct gta. now its pretty much guarantee s  next gta wont be same.
