let s be honest  denjI is the most down-to-earth protagonist cuz his motivation is so simple yet so profound to so many people who just want physical affection.
so happy this show is getting praise. the manga absolutely blew me away and got me hooked on the medium.
anime is sustaining me thru the drought of western content right now. this show is so good so far  incredible action and great characters even from episode one!
chainsaw man is one of my favorite mangas from the past few years. I love the fact that the japanese industry is way more open to blood and gore in animations.
Im into anime  kdramas and kpop. and I agree  they are a breath of fresh air comparing to the things hollywood have been delivering lately. chainsawman manga is awesome and by the looks of it I think they are going to do a very good job adapting it into an anime
for the last 2-3 years now I find myself watching way more anime than anything else because of how terrible other types of entertainment have been. chainsaw man has definitely been worth all the hype mappa did another amazing job
its awesome that you covered this. anime has something for everyone mood. even my anime-hating brother was recently hooked thanks to edgerunners. there is so much content on crunchyroll. added this one to the queue
I have to thank you melonie. I have something to watch now. I never really was turned on by anime as thought it was for the younger crowd  but this one opened my eyes as it hit home to what is missing from hollywood stuff.- mysterious art style  writing feels  and suspense.
34 chapters in the manga... and that first episode still hit me like a fucking truck  man. cried my eyes out multiple times! now this  this is art!!!
that first episode was very strong and showed a strong sens of style.mappa really has mastered 3d animation blending into anime  and they do really use the animation time they have saved up with that 3d to make the rest of the trad animation pure sakuga level.the great think about thatshow is that we know from the managa that the writing is strong all the way trough so we wont get betrayed with a shitstory twist or ending.
so few things melonie is this positive about  and a happy melonie always makes for a good video. keep the recommendations coming  you haven t steered me wrong yet.also got to mention  your shoulders still look amazing melonie. youre always an inspiration to go to the gym!!!
I love your rants when you call out the bs  but I love it even more when you share awesome stuff you like! Ive been waiting for this anime  but seen youreaction just hyped me up even more!
what I learned in this video is that melonie mac is an adorable sweet person. keep up the good work!
great review  mel! I absolutely love chainsaw man! Im already caught up with part 2! its a super good manga and it will be a super good anime too! I actually relate to denjI when it comes to wanting a girlfriend because I am also lonely   touch starved and crave affection from a woman  but for me it has to be with the right woman.
not a real big anime fan but after your review of  chainsaw man  I think I ll give it a shot.
Ive been curious about this anime. Imay have to watch it now. it does look really good. is the manga also on crunchyroll  finally something good. and other anime Ive watched I really enjoy like jujutsu kaisen. thank you for sharing. I enjoyed your video. take care melonie.
9 20 the mangaka  fujimoto  is a huge movie buff  another manga he penned  goodbye erI  is drawn like its 95   shot like an amateur movie   and the anime staff are referencing a bunch of movies in the intro  like texas chainsaw massacre  reservoir dogs  pulp fiction  no country for old men  constantine  sadako vs kayako  etc. much of the story takes influences from cinema  tomato devil in ep1 intro pays homage to  attack of the killer tomatoes   to name just one
really happy you liked it  chainsawman is awesome!!
as I am an anime only going into chainsaw man  I think they did a bang-up job on the first episode and thus will continue watching. in some ways  it gives off jujitsu kaisen vibes. the animation was very good  even the bits of cgI weren t bad  Ive seen far worse cgI   and the initial story in the episode is compelling. Ive seen people reviewing it on facebook anime groups and itseems they either love it or loathe it for some reason. I really dont rate anime on one episode alone  but for the first episode I would give it a solid eight out of ten  and for me that is saying a lot  as my overall average for rating anime with 1300 scores on mal is a 5.77.
watched episode 1 last night and really liked it. I ll be back to watch your review after work  melonie   just left this comment to help the algorithm till then
and food. and a better life.
right on. all he wants is love and some food
def realistic and relatable
@melonie mac go boom   love and some food  the name of my next romance novel
gintokI sakata is the best shonen protagonist as far as Im concerned.
man I waited so long for thatstoked that itstarts now the manga is freaking awesome no woke bs just pure entertaining
same. its a great show and a great manga!
same! so happy the show is actually here!
for me  anime is the only thing I can genuinely get excited for because I know its gonna be creative and not get stained by politics no one asked for.
anime is so much better
100
you should check out attack on titan as well  the series is mostly done so you can go through and binge it.
anime is just a word for japanese cartoons. just like cartoons in the west  its got animations for all ages including the very edgy adult stuff. my preference is slice of life like my love story and spy x family. but if I had to go the way of chainsaw man  which is bloody awesome   bleach  and full metal alchemist are some amazing choices from back in the day. in fact  bleach has a new season  which is said to be the finale of the series after all these years  called thousand year blood war.
Im glad Im not the only one. I cried like a baby. watched it a second time so I could show my dad and it took everything in me not to cry again  I just didn t want to cry in front of dad
@melonie mac go boom   dude  youre so spot on with this!!! after having my heart torn into pieces by edgerunners  I thought I was prepared for chainsaw man. was I wrong! hahahaha. mappa really did a fantastic job at bringing this story to life! I really hope and pray the quality is maintained for the rest of the show!!!!!! cuz this is breaking new ground in anime! at least  thats how I see it!
@melonie mac go boom  so what are his thoughts on chainsaw man  my dad would never watch anime lol
the manga is great and also power is best girl in chainsaw man
aw thank you
@melonie mac go boom  no problem! its the truth!
death note is another one you should see and and and and...
I haven t watched a lot of anime but I loved vampire hunter d back in the day and deathnote was incredible. this actually sounds very intriguing. a lonely soul craving love who hunts demons. Im sure somewhere down the line the demons will use that against him. I also just discovered k-pop last week. I only know one band. twice and I am team momo all the way
I read the manga  and all I can say is I cant wait to see it animated
love the first episode  mappa is one of then best animators we got in a decade. they hold back on there source martial.
this was fun...would like to see more of this kinda of content  anime game reviews...you look alot more relaxed and having fun. keep it up.
hell yeah  chainsaw man  and  housing complex c  have me pretty excited. I am a big fan of the bloodier horror animes.the world building and character development in anime and a lot of the k-shows are utterly crushing what is being put out in the west now
chainsawman was my first manga series I have ever read and fell in love with it.
man I have never felt such strong emotions for bread this was amazing
absolutely adored the first ep.I have read 11 volumes of the manga and oh me oh my  cant wait to see how they animate some of the future fight scenes  they are pretty damn epic    w denjI is probably most relatable main character Ive read about in a long while and he doesnt look anything like me  funny how that works   d
Im caught up on the manga.  its really funny in many parts  it balanced that with some serious themes. with thatsaid I didn t take it too seriously.  it gets really  really good fairly quick!  it doesnt drag on so the pacing is great.  it all speaks to my caveman brain making it one of my favorite mangas.  if you like mob psycho  you ll probably like this.  its at 106 chapters as I write this  there are over 1 000 chapters for one piece  so you cantotally binge read it and get ahead.  there are nods to different western films  if you are a cinephile you ll recognize some references.  now I gotta sit down a watch the anime with some drinks!  take the manga pill!
I absolutely loved the art-style and the plot of manga of chainsaw man. I hope this adaptation dont fall into the same traps the usual popular anime usually does.
just watched the 1st episode as well. theres a reason anime is doing so well as a medium.  the same thing happened with the demon slayer manga outselling every single american comic combined including both marvel and dc just on its own. you should also look out for a korean manhwa called solo leveling. its also really popular and will be getting a anime adaptation pretty soon.
I watched the first episode last night after seeing cosplayers and artists on twitter making chainsaw man characters which told me this was something worth checking out. the anime is my first exposure to it  and as far as that life reflecting scene goes  I think if you can understand the context  itstill gets the message across about wanting a girl. he just wants a normal life where he can be loved by someone and I viewed  score with a girl  as in actually getting a girlfriend  not getting sex  because of the context given. ya know  the whole  have a wife and a house with a white picket fence  thing.Im super excited to see more of this anime cuz this is looking to be a masterpiece next to spy x family  which its 2nd season started on october 1st .
this fall season anime is going be amazing with the return of bleach  final season of mob psycho  chainsaw man  blue lock and so much more!
the opening was awesome especially with what  it foreshadowed
the manga is brutal as hell... and probably is the reason why I like it
thank you for being an ambassador for good stuff!! where modern film disappoints  anime provides!
Im so happy to see you give a positive review. I hope there will be more soon
preparing myself to hear mel s thoughts on the final episode of she-hulk tomorrow. do you just upload them  or are they scheduled for a specific time
I watched it wednesday and loved it very true to the manga. looking forward to watching the season.
bro  ikr. the animation in this is so good. I cant tell if they rotoscoped or cg d certain areas  but the animation s top grade for sure.and  speaking as a guy that only finished the manga days before the anime aired  just batten the hatches  buckle up and hold on for dear life. shits not getting crazy  shits getting fujimoto.
thank you so much


yesss! I love brutal manga. one reason why I am really into dorohedoro too
no specific time  but I ll drop the video tomorrow  d shooting for upload somewhere around 12pm-3pm cst
chainsaw man is out ! heck yes! thanks mel  I have a new show to watch.
I love her anime reviews she really put me on future diary several years ago
just watched the cyberpunk anime on netflix  was actually pretty good in my opinion. I will have to check this one out as well.
I like the positive content  I think more videos like this will be good for your channel in the long run.
I started reading this manga awhile back and its just incredible.
Im into all of the anime and this was the best opening episode Ive ever seen especially considering the hype behind this show. the art direction and pacing was phenomenal. this show will definitely tug on the heart strings and rival demon slayer and aot.
with the manga  you project a lot more of your own interpretation onto what youread  like something that might seem like a joke to one person might seem serious to another. whereas in an anime  with voice acting and everything you kind of  lock down  a particular interpretation.
Ive been wanting to watch this since I hear about it months ago. unfortunately  I prefer watching anime dubbed  so I will have to wait. I really appreciate the review and I am thrilled to watch it! for those that think anime is just for kids or hentaI lovers  anime is beyond even some of the most popular action and romance live action movies and shows. for ladies that might be interested in an introduction anime  violet evergarden on netflix. gentlemen  jujutsu kaisen. stay frosty
I initially didn t care to watch this show  but Imay take a look because of what you just said  Im around minute 8 . regarding the idea of wanting woman affection  it really had an effect on me what you said as I feel the same thing. I remember always feeling a joy whenever someone touched me  man or woman  young or old. and I think that I ll probably die with this unfulfilled need to be loved. that is because I still have some anxiety being in big crowds  I tend to be socially awkward  and Im not very good in making lasting friendships. Im also a religious person so sometimes it feels unfair that this God of love doesnt do anything to help someone like me who wants to be loved  Imean I am in my mid-thirties and I never had a girlfriend so Im kind of a loser in that way  .I remember telling recently to my sister that the reason why I have this strong need to have a woman besides me is that I want to know how it feels having someone who wants you around her  who wants to build a future with you. Im used to be the funny and shy guy who is enjoyable when he is around but there is no loss if he s not around. so  I never felt a grown up really wanting me in their life. I talked once with a therapist about this hole I feel in my heart for a woman s affection and she told me that probably that hole wont be filled even if I d find this dream wife. she told me about a case with a woman who felt the same and she was in a happy marriage. but I shouldn t complain too much as I have a family  even if its not a perfect one  but when a family is ever perfect    a good job and Im relatively healthy   relatively healthy  because Im pretty obese  . anyway  it brings a smile on my face thatsomeone would feel emotional when seeing a guy  even though it is a fake one  having this pain I felt for years.
let s go boom
I love anime and I watch it way more than american stuff cuz they essentially do their own thing and they dont inject politics into the work and plus its just generally entertaining to watch like some of my favorite anime are stuff like asobI asobase  fairy tail  ascendance of a bookworm  spy x family  and bongou stray dogs just to name a few. also current Im watching a couple of cuckoos  spy x family  rurounI kenshin  and the yakuza s guide to babysitting.
I could never wear mascara. my eyes are too sensitive  I d look like a raccoon. you rock it well  mel
this is a 1 for 1 adaptation. made by fans for the fans. this story only goes up never dips
Im gonna be honest I was so hyped for bleach thousand year blood war  that I completely forgot about chainsaw man.
chainsaw man!!!! I love the chainsaw demon!! the manga was amazing Im so stoked youre stoked about this. this shit goes so hard all the way through. I need a chainsaw demon tattoo legit.
you got me into anime through death note and now Im hooked.
I love anime. a b-c level anime can also outshine anything in the western animation recently. I watched chainsaw man and it is just incredible.
I could spend the rest of my life catching up on all the anime Ive started on but haven t had time to finish.
Ive only heard about the manga  never really read any of it  kind of waited for the anime to be honest. but that first episode was dope af. fully enjoyed it  the ost was really good too. next will be episode 2 of bleach
I love me some chainsaw man. the manga is great! there will be down time. but when action happens its  go boom !
bang
denjI is 16 at the start of the series. also I love anime more than most movies and tv shows these days. like you said about hollywood and western cinema. and dont get me started on she-hulk. I love chainsaw man and mappa. I have watched this ep like a dozen times already. I cant wait for jujutsu kaisen season 2. im getting myself emotionally ready for fruits basket prelude. Im gonna cry on that one.
thats awesome you like anime  I was absolutely amazed by chainsaw man. I remember seeing the first animation previews some time ago and it has overwhelmed my expectations.
thanks for the tip.  I absolutely love anime!!! and am always looking for suggestions on new good anime I accually haven t seen yet
my parents had me growing up on anime and manga   before it was cool  lol  I have got so long been telling people there is more to anime then it being  for kids  or  porn  and they are missing out  I still feel that way and would actually say even more so now then ever people are missing out if they dont at least check some out. that all aside I would love to see a video of your top 5-10 animes!
dc animated toons and movies were legit great before 2016. marvel had a few gems too. they both keep releasing mediocre shite now unfortunately. I began watching anime maybe 13 years ago  a whole buncha flicks and shows are truly phenomenal. old and new. Im looking forward to seeing this series entirely!
forgot it was getting 12 different ed songs. the first one is already a solid 10 10.
the preview looked cool  I was planning on checking this show out.thanks  will watch.
ill wait for the whole season to binge. cant wait already xd
hey melonie  I recently discovered your channel via the yt algorithm and have been really enjoying your take on pop culture and modern media. if Imay be so bold as to suggest something  would you consider editing in some lo-fI or instrumental music to the background of your videos  I feel like it would really tie everything up together nicely and put the cherry on top of what already is really awesome content. keep it up  hope your channel blows up in the algorith even more!
I have not watched anime in a long time  but have really been wanting to get back into it. maybe I ll give this one a shot.
the great thing about anime is there s something for everyone to like. no two are exactly alike  just like people.
I agree with the point you made early in the video. I was very dismissive of anime for a very long time because I had an idea in my head of what it was like based on what Ive seen around the internet. a coworker of mine talked me into watching death note. I fell in love with it and then started binging a bunch of different anime shows. so  for anyone reading this and fed up with woke-ified western entertainment  look into anime. Im sure with a bit a research you will find your jam!
thought chainsaw man came out awhile ago but I guess not. the manga is a lot of fun so I ll be checking this out.
chainsawman episde one was stellar as hell loved itso beautiful.
this will be awesome if u do some ractions  or reviews of the episodes ... this anime is great im a big fan of this manga
I love kpop and have recently gotten into anime and sorta into kdramas. I would love to see more videos on what you like and recommend for people who are knew to it!
I think I got that  not just wanting hook-up  from the first watch  maybe it was a bit badly worded  haven t read the manga  but I got the wanting the affection more than a hook-up. at least when watching it in japanese with subtitles like I watch all my anime  for the love of ukko  couldn t wouldn t watch anything when dubbed  unless its old disney movies from my childhood.
bleach got me tearing up and its only going to get better. also checked this one out and im loving itso far. so far this season is amazing for anime! have you checked out the new gundam this season
there is alot of benifit from reading the light novels or source material to an anime they give more details even just in the subtle context or the art style and background inner character thoughts and such.
show them the way to anime!  I cried csm episode 1episode 2 comes out today!
I got that he was touch starved due to the fact that he doesnt seem to be any sort of player and he finally receives the affection he wanted at the end of the episode. he was so happy to be held by a woman at the end.
I love how he was concerned about breakfast and so happy for toast with jelly.
excuse some of the bad grammar and auto correct  for some reason my phone wont let me edit it to fix it. btw...
I ll look into that and try it  thank you for the suggestion
I wasn t into anime but I got into it in 2017 mannnn I cant get enough
im more into c-dramas than kdramas. just my preference. also love anime and watch a huge variety. also love the ecchI stuff. wish more people wouldn t bash the ecchI shows though because it makes it harder for certain shows thatsome people like   like myself  to get more seasons or to get the english translations brought over in light novels and manga. one of the light novels I wanted to read got turned down by publishers for english translation. Im pretty sure it was because so many people bashed the anime when it came out due to subject matter. it kind of sucks  especially since I tend to like stuff a bit on the darker side and too many people hate on those types of anime.
my roommate knocked on my door after his bar night   idlarI  yo idlari. you need to watch this new anime  chainsawman  I know your taste and you will like it.  yah  I just watch this fnt live first.  no  stop that and watch chainsawman now. you can watch that whatever later.  ok. watched it and got hooked instantly.
even after a year of trailers and reading the manga. I was in shock and I couldn t believe how good they made chapter 1. the most boring chapter  which is crazy lol.
I never read the manga  but I have watched the first few episodes of the anime. they do play up denjI s  I just want to score  and  I just want to touch boobs  thoughts for comedic effect  but so far  it doesnt seem like denjI is actually a sex crazed pervert. for starters  those are just the things he thinks  but his actual actions and thing he says to other characters show that he is looking for something more genuine. my guess is that if he was given a choice between a one night stand with some hot chick vs a real relationship with makima  he would never do the former at the expense of the later. I know it is a common anime troupe where the main character can have the women on the side as well as his primary love interest  but I dont think this is going to be one of those  harem  fantasy fulfillment animes.
this episode make me real emotional
I could listen to talk all day long and even more now. almost wish I didn t read the manga first!
if you haven t read the manga read it  its amazing!
my two favorite anime by a wide margin are...1. angel beats - 90  slapstick hilarity 10  soul crushing depression set in purgatory  which takes the form of a high school .2. spice and wolf - a traveling merchant teams up with a wolf Godess because modern farming techniques cost her all of her worshippers.I think Im doing it wrong.
I can relate to craving affection  thats honestly probably why a lot of us are just mean now and have lost it.
crazy  weird  an dope anime. at least from first ep
great review. now I am curious and want to watch it and then read the manga. very cool young lady.
if not for korean shows  old tv  and anime I d have nothing to watch. just finished alchemy of souls. so good.
I love that you are so passionate about it.
Im just not a fan of the art style. haven t watched a lot  but I do like the stories of what Ive seen as of late. and have forced myself to overlook the artwork. and slowly getting used to accepting it.saw this mentioned on weebs waifus. will eventually take a look.
hImelonie I watched couple of anime back in the day.keep bringing theseinteresting topics that you like covering.takecare melonie
this episode was dope!
I love your videos and I would love to see your reactions to the show in yt or twitch
not a fan of the cgI but I agree with you.
pochita nooooo  I haven t kept up with anime. nothing has really interested me  but this show has me hooked  and its only one episodes. a lot of anime I see seem to dip in quality  but I hope this one doesnt. seems promising so far. and I do like the mc he seems pretty cool. people think still that anime is for kids or young adults  but bro. show them this episode and they might change their mind lol. same with jojo s bizarre adventure. thatshow is crazy
spice and wolf is pretty good. I love angel beats but idk if its really good or not.
train to busan was a masterpiece. great piece.
I was very happy with that first episode.
Ive been looking for a new anime to check out. thanks.
I cant wait to check it out!
will you do more chainsaw man reviews next week   also read the manga very bingeable I read 90 chapters in a day
saw this pop up on a feed. had no idea what this was and never heard of it before. I was prepared to dismiss it  but now I ll have to check it out. thanks for the recommendation  and God bless!
just watched it last night with a friend and we loved it
you should read the goodbye erImanga its written by the same author and its very heartbreaking it will def make u cry
I had dream that  melanie did a review of      chainsaw man who would have thought it became  reality I hope you stick with it because its so much better then rings of power and mcu  combined
chainsaw man was dope  off to a great start
I cannot wait to watch this.  d
way of the house husband was amazing for real lol so was dragonmaid and not because boobs and the one where the lil 5 year old boy lives on his own that ones good too   as in recent animes
thanks for the recommendation!will you be reviewing every ep
probably best opening anime since it doesnt spoil much and most of scene are reference to movies like reservoir dogs  pulp fiction.
Ive been waiting so long for this!!!!
there is only a handful of animes Ive watched  this one looks interesting might give it a try.
Im a huge anime manga fan  but at this point  Ive covered something like 3500 series...so I do not bother keeping up with new stuff these days  lol. not much new to see after all that. Im glad anime is still around and providing entertainment  though.
I totally relate to this guy! always wanted a girlfriend
10 10 anime  with the manga.
maybe Im off here.. but its funny how you were talking about denjI being a gentleman and a scholar with women and in episode two its legit all  boobs
prophet! haha!
been waiting on this  Im also currently watching fuuto pi
thanks  I am gonna watch it. I am no anime watcher though. arcane is the animation I have seen in a long while though.
the only anime I could get into was castlevania and guyver but a buddy of mine at work told me about berserk and demon slayer  haven t made the time to watch them yet but they seem really interesting  have toy watched or do you watch those shows
Ive seen chainsaw man too. so good.
I just watched this randomly last night it was good.
anime is definitely an amazing outlet if you haven t seen it check out the gungrave anime it was gritty and amazing
cyberpunk edgerunners is the best anime in a long time hands down. castlevania was awesome. netflix believe it or not has been doing way better than most in the anime department. arcane was an awesome anime in the league of legends world. Im an old head anime fan and loved all these. I hope netflix continues to strive for really good anime. I dont get why they want to be so woke with the shows and movies but they can do so well with the animes
I haven t watch much anime since college. glad to see its still over the top fun.
have to watch ep 2  thanks for the reminder.
never got into anime but I do enjoy sci-fi. would be great to see a good heavily sci-fI themed anime.
chainsaw man is really good!
Im into all the things you talked about.
love it  I found your channel through your this video  really like your mindset
bleach thousand-year blood war is out as well  only one episode out and its phenomenal
watch spy family too. is amazing. I also saw that bleach got a new season if Im not mistaken. haven t watched it though  but Ive heard some good things about it.
1st ep was fab! mac are you gonna do reviews for season 6 of mha
I really enjoyed it  but damn that first half was hard to get through. I was getting depressed.
why cant I stop watching her content the show is great
by the way melonie did you know the opening of the show is a bunch of reference to good movie  pulp fiction  fight club
attack on titan  spy family  demon slayer  jujutsu kaisen  and now chainsaw man and blue lock. these are some of the japanese animes that are miles better than most western movies and tv shows right now. hollywood should take notes from them  otherwise we ll get more guyladriel or she-hulk.
depends on what type of shows you prefer. berserk is very gory with many explicit and graphic content. but the story is grand and gritty. also anime adaptation isn t as good. demon slayer is more standard series with likeable characters and animation is very good.
netflix isn t making anime  all they re doing is buying up projects that have already been created and slapping  netflix original  on them to stream. to be frank   netflix original  actually means  netflix exclusive  they didn t make them. and neither castlevania nor arcane were anime  as they were created by american and french studios  respectively.
if you like classic stuff  psycho-pass feels like a little bitsaner version of philip k dick. season 1 and 2 are really good and they are two distinct story arcs contained in their own season. if you like more modern stuff   astra lost in space  is nice.
@e k p  k  thanks!
this whole show  manga is dark and heavy so maybe it isn t yout style then  which is ok
love it. manga reader here. ya ll arn t ready. not for a single thing
6 42 I can relate to him
I d love if you made videos on jujutsu kaisen season 2
studio mappa also did the dororo reboot anime and vinalnd saga  both shows are amazing.
it gets goofier and better from here
you could do  a weekly weeb video to recommend something to watch or read or listen to. that d be pretty helpful.
the stars align I just bought a chainsaw love my chainsaw downed tree in my yard also Im a fan of  attack on titan  novice on anime .
hunter x hunter  gundam wing  and deathnote are some of my favorite animes. I hope you at least watched deathnote. if you haven t  then you should. deathnote is one of those  must watch  animes.
I love chainsaw man  Im watching all the episodes asap
the anime manga world is pretty good cant lie
Im not really big on anime anymore  but bleach was pretty good. I had to come back for that one.
shiiiiiit  I haven t had a hug  or any kind of affection  sent my way in 6 or 8 years
if you want well written anime  try konosuba  parysite  deathnote season 1  brotherhood  shield hero  aot  have questions on jjk if you want to answer them
Im too old for anime or manga. but my kids like it and so do some of my grandkids. hahaha
I like the way you pronounce the japanese names like pochita s.what s your opinion about the new mk legends snow blind   greetings from costa rica.
I definitely prefer anime over western entertainment especially black lagoon which is my favorite show ever  not just in anime but entertainment in general
trigger and w.i.t studios are also really good
denjI is great example of the extremes some young men live in. I know more than one 25  y o virgins that are altogether well put and you can see how obsessive some can became over getting a gf and getting laid. and those are the sane ones  I cant imagine how bad the unhinged ones get.
yes!! wish I had the time!!!!
you mentioned at the end of the video that there are several things youre into that you dont talk about on the channel because the subscribers aren t interested in them. honestly  I think you should talk about whatever you feel like. Im not into anime  but I watched your video  and will watch the first episode of chainsaw man later today. so even though the audience isn t into those things now  they could be later down the line.
I d love that. these videos probably wont get as many views but I genuinely love anime so it would be fun to do about once a week  d
Im 35 and I like it  youre never too old for anime
this really means a lot  thank you. I love eastern culture so much. anime  kdramas  and kpop music videos are my escape from the world and it d be nice to be able to share thatside of me more  even if just a little bit
@melonie mac go boom  I think most of yousr followers are willing to check out different things if someone we trust suggests them. other than pineapple on pizza of course. thats just wrong.
will check this one out.  do you have plans to review cyberpunk edgerunners
unexpected but welcome
great show
parasyte   death note ftw
dude anime and manga is like one of mu favorite things to read watch  they really got it right down there in japan
first anime that has piqued my interest since klk
you need to watch edgerunners its one best I have seen in a while.
Christian was enough for me but  wow your taste in anime too. perfecto ! youre my type of woman.
I used to watch sailor moon before going to school growing up lol
its beautiful to see you talk about something that makes you happy
I was wondering if this anime was good  but I do agree with watching tv and film form other countries. just wish they would do a proper berserk -_-
its bad a english translation. he didnt say he want to score anybody. he s actually say that he want to see how it feels to making love  one time before he died.
I read the manga I was so happy with this. anime and japanese media and comics are 100x better than american anything
hollywood writer   affection   what s that
castlevania is the bomb
I dont watch stuff like this. in the late 90s in the uk I did watch devilman when it came on tv. I came home from work quite late in the night and I caught most of it. it was pretty cool. then the bbc showed akira  and I liked that film. after that aired I watched ninja scroll which was epic. and then I got to see ghost in the shell  which was a good film.
last anime I saw was cowboy bebop in 2000  since then nothing have grabbed me  I love anime from the 80s and 90s   thats the best anime. im gonna try this but the artstyle isnt the kind I like
this was an amazing episode!
anime awesome
dragonball z is my go-to for getting  dudes  into anime... hooked me 20 years ago and Ive been a weeb ever since
that was a cool anime
those two are in my top 10  good taste!
yeah I was so bummed with how they translated it because it took away a lot from just how deeply denjI craved feminine affection. he didn t want to just score a lay. he wanted to feel love.
ive been saying this to friends for a while now. I was completely indifferent to western storytelling for over a decade and I just feel the west just cant tell interesting stories anymore. we re to focused on stupid pandering and optics politically curating everything draining creativity from writers. all the most engaging stories for me in recent years have come from the east in the form of movies tv shows anime manga and even video games ff14 had one of the most refreshingly balanced takes on politics that left me shocked in realizing the west would never take this kind of approach . I wont even consider watching western media until I know from the internet its that once every five years kinda hit.
have you ever seen the korean show all of us are dead on netflix  yes korea has some great film and tv shows
parasyte  has a more realistic and gruesome take on alien body snatcher s    and chainsaw man give s off the vibe that this story of the same genre
do a cowboy bebop anime review
any other anime recommendations  it has been a long while since Ive watched much.
also rumor has it the author gave mappa the go ahead to change aots ending
hmmm.  maybe I should give this a shot.
to me the real chainsaw man will always be ash williams hail to the king baby.
chainsaw man greatness
finally  a masterful other modern fiction! our battle will be legendary!-attack on titan
to be honest  I wasn t going to watch this show because it just looked like another gratuitous gore fest  as many are. I have issues with a lot of gore because I think about stuff too much  but after seeing your review I ll give it a try.
with your tattoos and grey shirt  the thumbnail for this video made it appear as if you were eating noodles.  I had to stare at it for a few seconds to see what it really was.
loved the first episode   but the computer animated element still needs work. makes scenes where it is incorporated feel a bitstuff imo.
and hunter x hunter will continue. cant wait
its a shame crunchyroll went premium only  I love anime  but getting a subscription for just one show is ridiculous... the selection of series we get in my country doesnt warrant the price...
honestly surprised you liked it. it has some of the most sick  disgusting imagery in an anime. thats the whole reason its hyped is because people love to push the boundaries of grotesque  disgusting visuals for the thrill and adrenaline. there are so many great anime series out there to cover  the return of bleach for one.
whoa anime reviews  kinda based in a weird way
chainsaw man is ok. denjI is a pretty tough dude but there s not a single character I could relate to or really like  this series just ended up being meh to me. thatsaid the animation and fight scenes are awesome and thats the reason I ll watch this.
definately check out cyberpunk edgerunners as well
I ll have to check it out. thanks for the recommendation
good  I hope mappa improves it
have you watched arcane on netflix  thats one anime america can be proud of vs traditional anime haha
japan is still holding out against the cult but dont get complacent and think it cant happen. they may not suffer from the same level of insanity we have to deal with over here but they still have plenty of woke corporatists to deal with.
heyo! would be nice to see some bleach content  if u watched the original series of course.
its good but its no jujutsu kaisen. Im glad mappa is getting better on that  anime shaded 3d background stuff. dorohedoro crawled so chainsaw man can run.
I ll pass for now  been too busy watching naruto
God intended humans to live in paradise and live forever but  satan challenged the creater in his right to rule
manga and anime still has the freedom of speech  expression and creativity. aka not woke and thank God for that
most anime I find super melodramatic and very cringe but this is my kind of anime.  huge berserk fan
as an anime only watcher  I enjoyed this first episode. however  I do believe the recent anime fandom has a huge problem of being mesmerized by animation instead of a good story.
you should also take a look at gundam witch from mercury
I d be more into anime if there weren t so many weirdos obsessed with it  obviously not talking about melonie . so many sketchy social media accounts with anime avatars.
I think ufotable are a much better studio than mappa
maybe I should get into anime. Imean Im into manga and I like indie comic books and I watch korean tv shows. hollywood at some point will crumble .
no offense but what always turns me off about  nime is the insanely degenerate community. emasculated men worshipping  nime waifus and mommy s etc. the main character of this show seems to be a pretty good representation of that tbh. I dont think its just the fringe of the community  or if it is on the fringes it is still a very vocal part of the community. I do like good animation and a serious story so Im not against it as an art form at all  and I would watch a good anime show or movie if it appeals to me but I have no clue if that exists and how would one even find it  looking through all that content to find something interesting would probably take way too much time.
have you seen spyxfamily  I think its the best series that came out this year.
anime is a medium not a genre. thatshould be noted with anyone who dosent understand it. and if you like comics try manga. that being said not a starter but one piece is the best.
I honestly felt like the 3d took away a lot from the fights and made it feel very generic and dry. just felt like a videogame character swinging chainsaws around erratically and it wasn t emotionally impactful. the story is great though but the fights definitely disappointed.

attack on titan has one of the best endings in fiction.people thatsay otherwise are misguided. people that compare it to got s ending have brain damage.
is it just me or shes looking more like wynonna ryder
I loooooove dorohedoro!
@melonie mac go boom    I used it to get some snobs start watching anime. imo  it  is a masterpiece of visual direction. plus  all those outros slap. I hope netflix does not fk it up.
just ignore them tbh. thats what I do. I will never admit I am part of animanga community hehe. thats why I avoid reddit or twitter like things
I guess I have brain damage then because the ending  of the manga  was just so underwhelming. first arc of season 4 was phenomenal  it just sucks that the last act fell so flat
the japanese aren t into the woke garbage  thats why anime reigns supreme.
here s how you get into anime you take what you like and you find a similar anime will it be one to one no but its the best way I can help you
I want a chainsaw pet doggo
animation is cool but man do I just really hate cgI but atleast its not as rough as others its got a lot better and less noticeable. I just hate the floating feeling of cg.
a girl s reaction to a big d be like
aside from original scooby doo and looney toons I only ever really watched anime.
hey fellow boomers!
where can I watch this show
japan is our last hope
I like anything and Im not like most people nowadays and thank God for that.
you gonna review bleach  thousand-year blood war
where s the cyberpunk  edgerunners review  that was a 11 10 series.
anime is alright but 80s and 90s american cartoons were top tier. now days intend to stick to animated video games movies are good be it mk legends or sonic etc. I heard the newer tekken series is solid or series like invincible. I never even heard of chainsaw man til now.
melonie you should watch edgerunners
spoiler alert the boob obsession in episode 2 is making it less tragic.
have you checked out cyberpunk edgerunners or violet evergarden
berserk 1997 is the best ! for me
love you
I watch anime cause it is a escape same way with manga and it isn t woke japan you better not do that bs
lmao what
me too!!!
@melonie mac go boom  my queen
well this is good news. and I like seeing a promotion of actual good entertainment. that way more people flock to it and develop better taste and all the crappy stuff mainstream entertainment try to shove down our throats lose more money. muhahahahahaha
so you are not only into  series also into anime lol  girl geek is getting my fav hard reviewer
what about ufotable
not demons   just devils ...forsure  read the manga
you have a funny dorky cute face
dragon ball dragon ball z and u-haul show thats the only animes I like
heard its mid
yo what kinda pop tarts u like
I suggest you try jojo bizarre adventure.
it is pretty sad how little view this gets compared to your other videos. people should start watching anime instead of all the bs marvel made lately.
I just got boom d!!
f western entertainment  anime is the future
I primarly watch anime now  most western shows are boring and uncreative
watch the thousand year war
ufotable is king no offense
I was 2
I love evangelion  berserk and cowboy bebop but my biggest problem with anime is how they constantly have to explain everything and hold your hand  this type of media should be show and dont tell and anime is really bad at just telling everything
sarah silverman reacting to anime
woh youre so beautiful...
hey dont dis on hentaI  hentaI is useful for  research for um  educational purpose. yes education is important. got an impression chainsaw man is a typical girl flick show. just based on his character and goals. so not my cup of tea.
thank you
I blame weboos
frosted cherry ftw!
I dont like the newer localization. always feels like a little punk that doesnt understand context is doing it
melanie mac your so cross eyed lol ahhhahahahhahahahahahaga
this sounds like the most cliche anime trope filled mess. I ll give it a watch on your recommendation  but this does not sound like  good storytelling.  itsounds like anime of the month.
reze is not in the anime so its bad
nah. modern anime is trash. I come from 80s and 90s anime. you cant go from that to modern anime. Im sure there are gems here and there  but everything my spouse tries to show me has been terrible.
does anyone know why she stopped wearing makeup
I hate mappa s cgi.
never liked that garbage so no thanks. skip.
the Bible disproves the theory of hell. its pretty simple.
so what makes chainsaw man special is he s an incel  definitely not selling me on it.
I still am wearing makeup  just no more eyeliner. Ive been trying different natural kpop makeup looks Ive been seeing haha
@melonie mac go boom  oh thank goodness. my wife said it looked like you weren t wearing any and I was worried you were gonna stop shaving your armpits next.
the Bible says the dead are conscious of nothing meaning..  when you are dead there is nothing.. no hell.. you dont exist   youremember how you came into this world
