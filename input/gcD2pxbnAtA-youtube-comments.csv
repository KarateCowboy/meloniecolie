meta  allows people to literally make comments wishing the deaths of russiansmelonie mac  wears funny shirtalso meta   we dont do that here
good Lord  we re really living in a thin skinned daycare world when a shirt like that is inciting  violence . glad you shaved your pits though. good form.
toxic positivity  I like that. explains all the fake bs perfectly.
I dont trust my government  I dont trust any government. I respect your opinion more and more each video I watch.also  you are looking gorgeous today  as usual. happy st. patricks day!
how culturally insensitive... punching people is a longstanding irish tradition after all.
sure seems like social media is getting much less social every year. no one can have a simple disagreement without fear of getting canceled by other users  or being banned by big tech.  this is the stupidest time-line. if anyone needs me  I will be in tamriel.
screw them! double down and post pictures of you in a tank top flexing your biceps with the caption  suns out  guns out.  they would probably hit you with 3 different policy violations keep on keeping on! love the content!
facebook   instagram  calling russians bad is ok. melonie  pinch me and I ll punch you. facebook   instagram  hold up there.
sometimes I feel bad I abandoned a instagram that I built with thousands of followers but then I remember how soft they ve  and everyone else  gotten.
graphic t shirts are not even meant to be taken seriously. not sure how this even falls against community guidelines if it just shows the rules of st. patrick s day.
I love it! its cute and feisty! just like you! annnnd yeah saying its inciting violence seems like actual sexism to me. as if you cant say that you will defend yourself from sexual assault.
I like it that you share your verse of the day in the videos that have other content. its great that you share that along with the gaming and pop culture current events content! keep up the great work!
well  it could ve been worse.  they could ve gone the solicitation route   youre offering to spank in exchange for a pinch. it is probably so aI that reads  I ll punch you  and flags violence  but leaves 3 million other stupid things up .
melanie  wears green shamrock cat ears!coltraine  not wearing green  stalks out of room before there are problems
0 05 cat goes   she s talking to the wall again! Im out of here until it passes.
its a lovely shirt and it looks fantastic on you!  shame on those dummies who had to find fault with a harmless shirt that never hurt a soul.  may 1000 leprechauns pee in their beer.
happy st. patrick s day mel! you always brighten my day. with respect to your shirt  I have seen way way worse dont understand how they judge some of this stuff.
Im loving your videos more and more  youre making me feel more comfortable to just be me in who I am as a person and the views and ideas  and also a believer in Christ. thank you.  much love melonie God bless you.
you look great in green  melanie. you rock!
you ll have to go to alternative platforms to get the truth about ukraine  you wont find it on corporate media or youtube.  as for social media  while it has its upside  overall  its literally turning our nation into a society of housecats.  the amount of younger generations from the millenials on down that cant hold a conversation and have  crippling anxiety  is beyond belief.   great video mel.  always question what the popular narrative.  and as always  thanks for the daily verse.
yeah  thats our county now... u.s. fubar
the good thing is that they are making it plainly obvious. Im sure the facade is over.
in the lizard s culture  that considers as a d move.
I got a 6 day ban on fb for  inciting violence  for joking thatsomeone should get a  kick in the balls  for dubbing shotgun sound effects over a pistol shootout video.so  they were fine with a video of a group of teens trying to carjack a woman  and her blasting them for it  but my joke was over the line.
without double standards they would have no standards
@bryan barton  indeed.
@lokI the cat  well  when companies that claim to ban for hate speech make an exception to call for the genocide of everyone from a country  yeah  I d say thats pretty extremist.
@ remI second that  no matter the nation or the political parties  at the top they are all the same. im a vet but I have become antI war  unless its self defence or it having to be a proven evil regimes like nazI germany or a stalinistic regime .
@afca nsf  I can imagine. once you have seen the horrors of war or even just combat first hand  it changes your perspective completely.
I know they made me post something about non woke meme which is interesting
waving at you from limgrave
@lucky strikez  halp! from the swamps of aeonia in caelid.
its 2022. no one is allowed to have a different opinion. no one is allowed to agree to disagree.
that one is actually allowed  for now.
I know its ridiculous
melonie should say she ll punch a russian  then fb and ig will be okay with it.
or perhaps before the video  for 5-10 minutes  melanie s kitty was comforting her and left because he was done... for now at least
@nitrocat meower  here s how a joke works - see my post above
yay macdrop!! thank you for cranking out consistent content. ig is ridiculous
thatshirt states the st patrick s green pinch punch rules perfectly
never knew about toxic positivty until you posted about it.its not possible to be positive all the time  we have something called feelings and there is nothing wrong with being sad or so forth sometimes..its part of life.if more would be open on how they really feel  I think the world would be a better place..love your content btw.shalom my sister in Christ
Ive been trying to make a gaming channel that incorporates Christian teachings and philosophy for a little while. my main issue is video editing for the videos I really want to do. I have an entire script planned out for videos over morality and fallout and others over different philosophical positions in other games and the Christian take  but it requires quite a bit of editing which I am just no good at. so I end up always doing gameplay recording with speeches superimposed over them. I love seeing someone combining sharing their faith with their takes on gaming and nerd news and hope to one day be able to do similar in my own fashion. love your channel!
I am glad I dont use social media that much. its all right to try and keep in touch with others  but it feels like one giant club to beat you over the head with a cringe ideas.p.s. I think they are just jelly that your shirt looks great on you and not them
I totally agree. I prefer to live with the bad people and get along with everyone than living in a puritan society where everyone watches you to make sure youre not a baddie.
hey mel  great to see you still going strong... been a while. you look great and that tats are fire. well! what do we expect from this broken way of life sheep are living. I love the shirt! will try and catch up on past vids.keep knocking them down as always.
well done today melanie. on the topic of tattoos  paul cleared this up many times in the pauline epistles  letters   if I remember correctly 13 letters. paul did make mention of things on a cultural stance which is basically where melanie was headed. tattoos and scarring at that time had lots of religious connotation  stigma   biases . paul s point was to avoid creating stumbling blocks. especially for those of the jewish community who wanted to believe in Christ but also had a lifetime of legalistic ritualistic religion they believed would save them. he was attempting to warn others not to become stumbling blocks to a fellow bother sister in their walk with Christ. however  paul went on many times to say that if truly washed in the blood of Christ  then you are truly saved. the letter to the roman church by paul has a nice answer for the idea through the topic of guilt or Christians feeling of guilt.  therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.   romans 8 1 I would suggest a deeper dive for anyone feeling that tattoos are a problem. again  it was a cultural thing  same with women not taking leadership in the church. it had nothing to do with paul or the church against women  it had to do with cultural stigmas that paul didn t want distracting from Christ and a person s potential salvation.  therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer  but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.   romans 14 13 here is a current cultural stigma  17 year old girl who is legally the age of consent marries a 55-year-old man. how does our culture view this today  how do you view to this  now let s make that 55 year old man a religious leader. does his relationship with a significantly younger female help your opinion of him or the religion he practices  tattoos and self scarring once fell under this same cultural stigma and judgment.thus I reiterate   no power in the sky above or in the earth below indeed  nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.   romans 8 39 there is a reason the first 4 books of the new testament are called   the good news.
I kinda randomly found your channel but I definitely dig your vibe  gamer  antI woke crap   laid back Christian and not trusting the govt   mainstream  news   all awesome things
one way to know youre doing something right is when social media will ban you for it.-permabanned from facebook after several 30 day bans
happy saint patrick s day! the irish people were once mistreated in america. many have forgotten that fact. they act like early 1900s immigrants were never treated badly  and that blacks were the only people to have a hard time. I like your shirt btw.green is my favorite color and thatshade is nice.
youre completely right about the tattoo and also craven images are false idols either in your skin or wood  not images that relate to deco or events in your life ...etc
your verses of the day are so encouraging!  please keep on reading them  melonie!
I guess ig cant take a joke apparently  but yes there are good people melonie  what we re not is perfect.
you definitely have a social media network nemesis out there  mel! they have zero life in the process but to each their own  basement dweller !
I love watching your videos  in many ways you mirror how I feel about stuff. however Im not religious. but listen to your takes on the Bible and religion in general is interesting to me. makes me feel we can disagree  but also come together.
you look great today mel!  green d cor looks good on you!
tattoos are definitely not sinful  Im friends with multiple norbertines who have awesome tats and had one of them bless mine. they have a special prayer for it and everything. might be different tho because Im catholic. he just said to be sure you go to a reliable artist because a lot of them actually curse the ink they use. either get your ink blessed or go to someone you trust wont curse you lol
I have always thought we should take everything literal on a t-shirt or top
you know they doing this stuff because they re afraid of you girl  keep doing what youre doing I love it
first!!!
on what planet do people pinch each other on st patrick s day  that the craziest thing Ive heard today.
@stacey funk  never heard of  if you dont wear green on stpaddys you get pinched   its been a social tradition for years in western cultures.
@stacey funk  on st patrick s day  if you dont wear green  anyone can punch you. but if you are wearing green and you get pinched  you point out the green clothing and punch in return. you learn of the tradition at  school  elementary school for me   and it mostly gets observed among friends and acquaintances
@stacey funk   watch new south park episode where pinching someone for not wearing green is sexual assault
be careful when mixing entertainment   religious beliefs. it could either cringe so hard or diminish the spirituality.
Ive been suspended from twitter about 6 times for telling people my opinions on gender sex  which is backed by science since they shared their opinions towards me  and instagram Ive had around 16 posts removed too. I ll never stop fighting for common sense.
@midna  based.I dont feel like setting up another facebook account. but I take some pride in having been permabanned.twitter also banned me before  but my account was so short lived that I dont really count it as much.
can confirm. on my third facebook account and I regret nothing.
new sub here. I like your shirt  itsays the same thing I have always said to people. I hate being pinched no matter what so on st. patrick s day I tell everyone who does like it.  pinch me and I ll hit you back  how hard is it for people to understand not everyone likes to take part in something  but whatever its the  I want my cake and eat it to  stuff.
hey mel I just want to tell you that I am truly truly sorry that happened to you today. anyway I think that you can wear whatever you want to wear for the holidays like today and post it on social media like twitter   instagram and facebook  ok. anyway I dont like when social media is going after someone like you who has a outfit on and post it on social media and get backlash for having a outfit on and post it on social media  ok mel. anyway I think that they are trying to find a way to get people to stay off social media and get them mad and upset with them that they can not do what they want to do on social media networks  ok mel. anyway I do hope you understand what I am trying to say to you bout this topic  ok mel. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok mel.
I think you did nothing wrong I think social media is taking censorship a bit too far keep doing what youre doing much much peace and love
love the shirt!  d  all levels of government are shady in one way or another.  question everything and remain vigilant.
dang girl  I deleted twitter like 4 years ago but you make me want to hop back on just to see your antics.
as an atheist  its refreshing how a content creator shares Christian values with their audience. I dont mind this kind of stuff as long as it doesnt go beyond the realms of forcing people on what their religious views are and how it is the right thing to do. as long as it gives out positive outlook not just in a religious perspective  Im all down with it. keep being you melonie  dont let those negativities persuade you.
I love the phrase  toxic positivity.
melonie  you are so freaking adorable. go on wit yo bad self!
as a fellow Christian  I like your additions of simple Bible verses and short commentary  it adds to my day without listening to a sermon or an hour long study. and as more than one of my pastors have said from the pulpit we need to  take the message with us as we go   including a brief biblical commentary at the end of a youtube video is a great simple example of this concept  in action  as you go boom!!!oh oh oh  today  yes st pats day  is my birthday  thanks for the perfect ending to my day!!!  -
happy st. patty s day to you too  melonie!
youre a fellow free thinker who can entertain a thought without marrying it. I would say conspiracy theorist is just a term they use to shame people out of thinking for themselves.
who knew one of my favorite youtubers from back in the day was this based! glad to be back in the community
you should actually try a shirt thatsays  physically assault me and I ll defend myself by punching you  or somthing similiar and see what happens.I d like to see how they deal with different types particular language being used tI see where they really are at.
tattoos are unholy and sinful  everyone is entitled to their opinion  but let s be honest  thats all that comment was. every time I get a tattoo it means something to me  they tell my story. if someone doesnt like thatstory  they can feel free to close the book and walk away. Ive made it this far with out them  I think I ll be fine continuing so.
had a thought earlier today  have you ever seen Godspell  either the play or the movie... if so  what did you think of it  I got to see the play for my dad s 40th birthday cause it was at the local municipal theater  and Ive had the songs stuck in my head ever since.
thank you almighty social media leaders for saving our lives from this horrible photo of violence........ sigh
when the photos make you want to join social media but the response from social media companies doesnt.
I love the Bible verse with this and how you brought it all in.  thank you!  that is awesome!
a friend just sent me a screenshot of your twitter post about this  as I was complaining about getting a facebook post removed  complete with 2 day ban  for the same type of  community standards violation   and this video showed up in my recommendations right away. today is a good day.
in 2013 a man flying to new zealand on qantas airways was told he had to remove his shirt because he was deemed a security risk.  he wore a shirt referencing the princess bride   hello. my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.
hello  I like your shirt  personally Im not a fan of tattoos  unless  like yours  they re well done. there are some women in my office with tattoos and the phrase  tramp stamp  springs to mind. Im friends with several  women with tattoos that can only be described as spectacular. Ive seen a dragon running from a woman s wrist  along her arm  across and down her back and down her opposite leg. must have cost a fortune and hurt like hell. impressive though.
you look really cute in green! such an awesome color and ik your aren t the biggest reboot lara fan  but her jade necklace would be a nice addition to the outfit.
such a dimepiece melonie! the opinions make it even better
instagram got mad at me because I said  evil must be defeated.  said I was inciting violence like wth
happy st. patty s day. youre outfit is very cute. I love it. the mods at ig need to get a life.
irinn go br ch  melonie! friendly reminder to everyone out there that no mater your race  ethnicity  skin color  nationality  etc.  we re all irish today. so have a drink and an amazing st patrick s day! just be sure you left whiskey and pototoes last night for st paddy!
not only is meta telling us what not to say but now they tell us what to say.
hey mel  been a while!but yeah  can confirm this. I got banned for 2 days on facebook for using the word  punch  in a sentence. its the word  punch  thats censored. its so stupid.
happy belated st. patrick s day to the always beautiful woman with the most beautiful smile melonie!!
I cant understand why at this point ppl still stick to twitter  facebook  insta  etc... btw you look gorgeous in thatshirt.
that is hilarious  what a time to be alive.
melonie one of my go-to keto recipes is very apropos. get a 3 lb corned beef brisket. 90 mins in the instant pot with a half cup of water at high pressure. natural slow pressure release. pure heaven for days.having done full contact fighting for some 32 years now  started at 7  wanted to be like the ninja turtles   double dragon  -- the whole  no moral violence  thing is hilarious. personally  I love incitement to violence. in fact  Im going to bjj class tonight where  25 of us will incite each other to violence. it will be a fun time with friends. all these hoplophobes know nothing. I incite violence six days of the week. its been a major life improvement. violence is never the answer. its the question  the answer is  yes .
I dont trust my government  I dont trust any government  honestly.  no wiser words have ever been spoken.
I think the one gif you made of pausing the game and saying  wut   fits pretty well with this.
I wonder how many on here were thinking if a pinch would be worth the punch   instagram is ridiculous.  happy belated st. patrick s day!
so instagram tagged your thirst trap  imagine my shock
I think it is adorable and hilarious.  I guess everything cant be a joke anymore. I was banned on fb for inciting violence....against spiders.
what I got from this washate speech is not allowed!!! except if we dont like them then hate speech is allowed!!!edit  I am not a fan of  anyone   any group of people  who wants to censor or control what other people say or think. reminds me of a certain group of people that ended up deleting another group of people.
I am curious  have you seen midnight mass  if not  its a fantastic horror show on netflix directed by mike flanagan  haunting of hill house  hush etc  where the central theme of the story is about religion. there is something else but I cant say without spoiling it. would be curious to know what your thoughts are on it  as a Christian.
instagram scolds you for being beautiful  smart  and grounded in actual reality
wonder how they would react to a joke shirt I have. itsays    warning. do not disturb. psychopat under treatment. xd
marks on the body  is a reference to capital punishment by beating. whips and sticks leave mean scars that will forever tell everyone that you ve been found quilty and were in a position to receive that kind of punishment.
I wonder what instagram would think of my old cannibal corpse shirts.
sweet melonie your tank top shirt isawesome.keep being you  thankyou for continuing to say scriptures your wonderful takecare melonie
yup! this whole video! right on melonie.
I dont trust any government.  okay please marry me now.
does the shirt sentiment also count for  a pinch and a punch for the first day of the month
thats nothing but a fair warning. if someone puts their hands on you  you get to put your hands on them.
it was great seeing you on friday night tights yesterday!
it always circles back to tomb raider. lmao more videos on that coming out in the future Im sure! see you guys soon. lol
you and rekeita law are the best recent channels l subbed to
... I now have a crazy urge to pinch you just cuz lol I d take the punch not a single care given. love your videos and your personality. keep all the crazies triggered and mad. Im here for it.
left facebook 7years ago  left twitter 1 and a half years ago  never go on instagram or tiktok  my mental state improved 80 .
where have you been all my life. I love what your doing and I hope you keep crushing
love thatshirt - in the real world
no  correction  they scolded you for saying  I ll punch you ...fb insta is real sensitive  I was on a 30 for simply saying  dont let yourself become a victim   do a police page s post about how to cower in fear when youre being carjacked.
love your channel and what yourepresent. its really telling how those of the libertarian persuasion are the counter culture. its more fun to be able to dunk on both sides. why would you limit yourself by choosing one side anyway  I thought the tattoo thing was specifically in regard to dead loved ones. if its not explicitly biblical then no Christian should complain about it. I would tell anyone that tried to foist their particular religious beliefs on me that they re not my pastor and certainly not my Jesus.in regard to ukraine though  even if there is nefarious mass manipulation at play  which of course there is  I know that the ones that are suffering most and are in the toughest spot are the ukrainians. speaking of which Ive seen a bunch of them refer to russians as orcs and that they should go back to mordor  in both yt comments and soldiers in videos.ps  no more super pacs.
I really do despise society these days.
if you want technicalities. creating a tattoo makes miniscars on the body. how ever the body does heal from it just leaving the ink under the skin.
Im not being a simp but I ll say your tattoos looks good with your saint patrick s day clothing all you need a irish flag in the background
nick and melonie would be a killer combo
@mrnorker77  and eric july
I thought I remember you wearing this before    I dunno why now its a problem
another banger. also if y all dont mind saying a lil prayer for us out in north west texas. we have wild fires burning like crazy right now. much love yall.
question  why are we depending on platforms that obviously dont depend on us  anymore
retake the photo with black tape over the  punch  part as if youre censoring yourself. then watch it get mistaken for people thinking its a sexual reference  in which case it would still stay up lol
happy st. paddy s day  mel
cute photos. really enjoying your new types of videos!
instagram is so ridiculous I swear
mel you are amazingrock on
having the power to move the goalpost must be nice. us peasants wouldn t know.
want me to punchisize your face for free  -officer farva
love green lighting and proof that big tech doesnt get sarcasm and real jokes for a freaking shirt smh.  welcome to idiocracy smh also let s go brandon fjb fjt.
hI  I wanna try this shirt  as a drawing  in my instagram to see what happens  I ll tag you ofc c
happy st. patrick s day ! also haters mad as  usual. in this case meta btw  do you know trisha hershburger
remember when facebook had the option to  poke  people   they probably got rid of it because it was hostile  violent  and oh-so offensive.  also  Im not one to advocate for violence  but a lot of people nowadays have never been punched and it really shows
back in the day internet was like the wild west no rules just be crazy to an extent but now if you say something they will censor or cancel you
beautiful pics  mel! thanks for posting. I cant quite figure out if your  y all  is kentucky southern or texas southern  either way  ky boy here and I love it. happy st pat s day!
happy st paddy s day  wow melonie mac and looking amazing and beautiful
both facebook and instagram have been acting more and more like the ministry of truth   or whatever the name was for 1984 .
bel-air-uh-oosian counterpart nailed it
personally I feel threatened by your shirt and post. I am hiding in a safe space now.
I have one tat  and its caused more than one conversation about religion and my beliefs.  its a black dragon wrapped around an otherwise empty rugged wooden cross.  what it means to me is that no matter how much the devil tries to interfere with my life  the Lord will be one step ahead.  if its a sin to have a permanent reminder of your faith  I ll gladly answer for it at the gates.
I feel like this is a shirt my daughter would wear and shes only 7 lol
butters didn t have a good st patrick s day. poor butters.
as long as you are sharing the word of God you are doing his work. you dont have to give a sermon to deliver his word. just by you sharing your faith and his worth you please him in in those acts. as a specifies in leviticus that in all that we do we must have our beloved father on our minds. and where we walk  in our works  and among total strangers. keep doing what youre doing I have seen a couple of your videos and it is fantastic that youre integrating the faith into your videos
instagram aka facebook 2.0.. its crap that your post got deleted..
having come up through the 80s and 90s I cant believe how fragile we ve become. God forbid we ever have a ukraine situation in the united states. I look around and all I see is a bunch of scared little rabbits.
happy st.patrick s day melonie!  pinch !
you all know that its an algorithm that probably flagged it right  not some weird person at a desk going through every single ig photo to look for potential violence.
on the subject of tattoos and the Bible  I wrote in to louder with crowder and I was lucky enough for them to answer my question. I asked what their thoughts were on tattoos and gerald a said that in the book of revelation  itsays   on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written  king of kings and Lord of Lords.  which can be interpreted that Jesus has a tattoo.
dont worry melonie  Im not going to pinch  touch  or go anywhere near you.
pretty much sums up why gab is inevitable.
yeah this content is throwing me in to fits of rage how controversia...naw I gotta stop playin. girl you look so cute. keep up the good work and happy st. paddys 2 ya
if you haven t already watched it  I highly recommend that you take a look at  wag the dog  starring dustin hoffman and robert deniro.
Im atheist and I dont like tattoos or piercings or anything like that. on top of that I dont like tomb rider either lol  but melonie is so adorable and nice that I cant help but like her and care about what she has to say.
its because you are a boomerang boomer.  I love thatshirt.
I love your stuff and I love that youre Christian
good Lord  the system is broken on instagram.sorry you have to go through all that over a t-shirt with a catchy message  melonie mac.to be honest  there are some people like eugenia cooney on instagram that are allowed to  body check  themselves on ig  twitter and even twitch.being pro-ana that eugenia truly is  but she herself continues to live in a world of denial and toxic positivity  will continue to have a negative impact for people like her to follow her example - albeitsetting a bad example for teenagers wanting to look like her!yet  social media is allowing eugenia to get away without even having the nerve to restrict her any of her content.I fear this isn t going to end well for eugenia  as she s already been pro-ana for nearly a decade even though she got some sort of help fromshane dawson - he s unfortunately a crook nowadays.Im sorry to say all this  melonie  but you do have good intentions for social media while others like eugenia do not.thanks for hearing me out!oh  and good work on select lessons from the Bible!check out a passage from the Bible about casting judgement upon those who dont deserve it.
me  would it be worth it ..... pinch  melonie mac go boom  booming punch me  falls back worth it. lolhappy st patties day I love because green is my favorite color unless we are playing magic the gathering. a long time ago I was sent by a breaded man with the heart of dragon who called himself the quartering  and I have been enjoying your video ever since. Ive even bought tomb raider 1  2  and 3 on my ps3  yes I still love using the system  hard games but fun. I haven t got into the souls games it has nothing to do with the difficulty  Ive played through some games without getting the health upgrades for the challenge
yes! I remember when you could joke online and have other people laugh and not get all butthurt and offended by everything. my uncle made a joke on a facebook post about a crab  that is going to be his meal and the vegan community was attacking him. he made a joke! the internet used to be fun  but now all of the whiney toxic babies of the world have taken it over. one of these days Im just going to go social media silent on everything and just stick to my hobbies.
your shirt just made me laugh
to be fair though if I were to playfully give a painless pinch on holiday because its tradition  and you were to literally punch me for it  I d sue.
george carlin in one of his last specials said  soft language creates soft ppl  here we are in 2022 where this women cant post her cute pics bc the shirt says punch you on it.
sadly social media has been really censored and looking for alternatives should be considered.I only trust monke.
tattoos are not unholy nor are they sinful  they are reflections of the person within and records of their lives.
part of me feels like if I pinched you and you punched me Imight say   ok...pinched me harder...and lower!!!
picky blinders is a good show I recommend it to everyone by the orders of the peaky blinders !
to quote demon hunter   I will fail you.
gonna simp for just a sec and say those violent images were some of the most gorgeous pics.that is all  carry on
actually pinching someone 1st counts as an assault if you hit them back they shouldn t do anything.
I guess it really isn t easy being green.
alt tech is becoming more and more vitalthis is getting ridiculous
I approve this message.
hey. I found your channel yesterday and I thought that you make interesting videos on gaming. saw you in my recomended today and to find out that you were Christian was surprising. I think you have some good ideas  and some interesting trivia   so I ll be sure to watch your uploads regurarly.have a happy st. patricks day!
frankie go boom
Ive never wanted to  ship  anyone much less youtubers. but I want to ship melonie mac and the critical drinker
I spent seven months out of last year in facebook jail.  all of their rules only apply to one side of the political aisle.
you look stunning  lucky charms
just fyI  for a 6 6  300lbs man  thatshirt is just an invitation.
we have to remember that those who quote the old testament  to try and make those of us with tattoos and piercings feel like wicked people seem to forget that we are no longer held accountable by the law but are covered and justified through Christ s sacrifice on the cross.
tattoo thing was only in reference to levites too. there s this guy named paul . wrote like a third of the Bible. made a distinction between ritual law and sin that is in and of itself wrong. its sort of the whole point of several of his books.
d awww
the law was never given to the gentiles. it was for the hebrews. Jesus only gave us two commandments..
facebook doesnt understand sarcasm either. youre lucky youre not in facebook jail!
I think the  your body is a temple  verse gets a little misinterpreted sometimes. I dont really think if we get tattoos  even if they are Bible related the Lord is going to care anyways  because the Lord looks at the heart and not so much the outer appearance. then again I also wouldn t recommend anyone going out and getting a tattoo of satan or 666 on their bodies because that would just be creepy.
dang to bad insta blocked that photo you look cute in thatshirt
belurians are citizens of belarus which is north of ukraine. their government is siding and even helping the russian government. God bless you and your good work.
one of my favorite anime is psycho-pass specially if you like cyberpunk and I think it got better with the current social climate.
all social media media is getting insane I posted on facebook  I killed this guy with a sword in a video game  and they banned me for a day. like what
zucc says no to festive and harmless but already no far most revealing post that are still up to far worse on anything from the hell hole of zucc owned things.
uh-oh  getting in trouble with the fun policelolkeep being awesomego boom
hey melanie  I just discovered you in my feed thanks to the algorithms here at yt  or the subject matter  so Im a noob to your channel. but I clicked because youre very pretty  and I hate anything woke or far left. these people must be stopped. they re getting worse and worse because they have gone  for the most part  un-checked. the other day I got an account warning from fakebook for saying  Im gonna kick your butt!  to one of my friends  in a goofy exchange. not Im going to kick your  ss...but Im gonna kick your butt. literally. smh
I love how this is removed  but the map community is flourishing on these platforms... welcome to 2022. we will never have flying cars at this rate. t_t
lol.. instagram dont like it but it looks good on ya.
arbitrary as hell rules and regulations. one minute it ll be terrible to insult someone insight violence but then its fine to do it to those we dont like. screw these platforms  I want a xbox 360 game chat-based social media sight for everything
its ok if we do it!
I actually enjoy melonie s Bible verses  strong message...even though I think religion is silly and made up
being pinched without consent is assault  so by banning you they are punishing the  potential  victim.
my wife has a white a shirt that has something along the lines of  cant beat this wife  or something  and her post got flagged.
cant say as I agree with the  are any of us good  no  statement from what I understand romans 3 12 speaks more to the self centered nature of man. as that insures that there is never a truly  such a thing as an innocent. even one who has done good for most of ones life will inevitably sin.
took me a second to realize thatsaid pinch and not  punch  lol
if you live in europe you cantrust media  if you live in russia  definately do not trust the media! slava ukraini!
I really dont understand why conservative  or at least free speech  versions of social media platforms haven t appeared and become popular.
thats a good one. I need to see second season.  only seen first
@daniel n  they are up to the part three but its a new team also the movie
you will get over that when you are as old as me being pinched becomes a perk and yes social media is trash
if God made us in its own image  and God is good  then we are good as well.
what a load!  -- bender the robot  futurama
punching may be assault  but pinching is at the very least battery. both are illegal when unwelcome. people should keep their hands to themselves. what happened to thatsocial distancing thing that I still occasionally see someone whine about
Im pretty sure Jesus said  its not what goes into  or onto by extapolation  a man that defiles him  but what comes out of him that defiles. besides which  the law was never given to the gentiles..
ha just saw you on the crigler show  I thought of this the whole time you were talking about that on there!   its ok the punch a nazI  unless they are in the ukraine  apparently!
its mighty hypocritical of people to insist that we defend ukraine s borders and yet ignore our own.
only fans would allow you to post thatshirt  just sayin
you think thats bad  I got a 6 day ban on fb for  inciting violence  for joking thatsomeone should get a  kick in the balls  for dubbing shotgun sound effects over a pistol shootout video.so  they were fine with a video of a group of teens trying to carjack a woman  and her blasting them for it  but my joke was over the line.
alright  melonie s not going to get pinched - but she ll get warnings. lolnow see  I actually got a warning and a pic taken down because itsaid what I d be doing after dark when everyone is sleeping - siphoning gas. yeah they said they were worried my pic would encourage people to commitsuicide. even gave me a telephone number in case I was thinking of harming myself.  rolling eyes
someone about to be put on some no-fly lists
about tattoos  honest opinion   yes  the Bible does not mention tattoos  and yes  the leviticus verse talks about scars done in pagan rituals and  in general  God forbidding his people from doing a bounch of practices that pagan countries did. as a Christian  I personally dont have a problem with people with tattoos  I just think that tattos are ugly and dumb. but hey  we all have free will  right
cool stuff!love the shirt!what is the closing music at the end of your videos
@ 9 24 time frame  leviticus 19 28 I believe is the verse they are talking about. they are wrong though. during that time and that covenant  pagan practices were a common thing  and so God instructed them not to practice the art of tattoo s.........key point here is at that time period. so you are right  tattoo s are not necessarily sinful  unless of course the context in which you get them in. Imean  I personally dont have tattoo s because Im not a fan of marking my body  even with a really cool and meaningful design  though I dont mind it if another individual does have them  even if he or she is a Christian fellow. so yeah  tattoo s are something you can get  just make sure to understand the meaning behind the reason why you get one. the meaning behind people s actions are far more important than something superficial.
sticking to the approved narrative.. that is how authoritarian governments does it  i.e. ccp. the current us admin is using the playbook of the ccp when it comes to freedom of expression and freedom of information.
cool shirt!
Im so over Christians trying to control other Christians regarding tattoos etc.being Christian doesnt excuse being a judgemental prick   in my experience people who harps on about minutious details lack a certain depth of faith.
sooooo  according to them its ok to pinch you. noted.
boy I swear these people that are running these social media sites are getting way too damn sensitive!
also the hebrew says do not mark yourself for the dead  like you said it was a pagan practice!    I have tattoos myself!  Im glad adam had you on!
to be fair  that really is a bad  tasteless joke.
@onemanarmy36  its a tasteless to joke thatsomeone who put bad sfx over a shooting video needs a kick 1  not really  if anything it was tasteless of them to put the sfx there.2  its still not incitement.
so you are admitting to being a dirty thief
@mr. marc g.  entrepreneur my man. entrepreneur.
yes! I agree mook!
no it is not because of your shirt. it is because you have beautiful body and look like a real lady. you actually have a figure that real men find attractive. to go with your shape  you have a functional brain!
no  tattoo s are not inherently unholy and sinful. it would depend on what is tattooed. and being tattooed is not in violation of the ten commandments. explanation   scripture makes it clear that God cares about the inside of a person more than the outside.  man looks on the outward appearance  but the Lord looks on the heart   1 samuel 16 7 .
so you should attach a sticky note  if you are russian
the Bible specifically bars tattoos  or cutting  in honor of the dead  leviticus 19 28  a notable pagan practice. in the same vein is the offering up  or pouring out of  food and drink unto the dead  deuteronomy 26 14. there is also a general ban against any and all pagan practices unto their Gods  exodus 23 24  or more succinctly put in deuteronomy 12 30-31.
pinch me and I ll punch you   for some people thats practically an invitation  and they ll actually enjoy it when you punch them   not me of course  honest  not any more anyway  cant  the last one cut my hands off  thought that was a bit much really  wasn t what the t-shirt promised
ok so I felt insecure in my ideals on tattoos so I did some research. while yes  you are right about the verse thatsaid to not mark your body  tattoos are still mostly sinful. according to romans 12 1   I appeal to you by the compassions of God  brothers  to present your bodies as a living sacrifice  holy and acceptable to God  a sacred service with your reason . there is also proverbs 4 7 which says  wisdom is the most important thing  so aquire wisdom  and with all you aquire  aquire understanding. . and lastly there is proverbs 21 5 thatsays  the plans of the diligent surely lead to success  but all who are hasty surely head for poverty. . so I know these dont seem at first like they have anything to do with tattoos  but hear me out. let s start with roman s 12 1  which is basically saying that your body should stay holy and pure  which of course markings of say pagans goes against this entirely  but I would also say that tattoos based on secular things are bad as well since especially nowadays  most secular culture is unGodly. now for proverbs 4 7  which I think connects to the last verse very well  is just be wise with the things you do and what you put on your body  dont put things like creepy clowns or a gargoyles on your skin. and lastly proverbs 21 5  which is basically saying be patient and not hasty. so basically dont make decisions like putting tattoos on you in the spur of the moment since something is currently trending like baby yoda or something  since hasty decisions usually lead to the wrong one in these types of scenarios. so basically you should be careful what you put on you especially if it is anti-Godly. for me  I dont think that my opinions have changed that you shouldn t mark your body unless I had something sentimental that I wouldn t ever want to forget because it honestly seems like a minefield lol. also have met people who tattooed popular influencers from like the 90 s and regret it now. so my advice is be mindful  wise  and dont do it if you dont feel right about it. but the people who say  people who are tatted up are gonna go to hell  are just wrong. there is no sin that is to great that God couldn t forgive  and anyone is redeemable if you open your heart to God. wow this became a long message lol. thanks for reading if you got this far and God bless!
yes  people are inherently bad  not the other way around. glad to hear someone agree. this is why the joker character resonates with people. because he s right. this is why star wars resonates with people  because we are all tainted with a dark side than can be manipulated. it takes rules  laws and maybe religion to make us good.I dont agree with tattoos though lol. if you had a lamborghinI  would you put a bumper sticker on it  tattoos are a failure to realize that clothing already allows you to express yourself and in a much more honest way - with the admission thatsuch an expression would change from time to time. tattoos  being permanent  are  in thatsense  a lie. also  if youre all about something  tattoos tell everyone that you are. why  why do you need others to know what youre about. let them ask you and find out. also  as razorfist once said  tattoos used to mean you were a certain kind of person  now it just means youre a person because everyone and their dog has one now. im outta here before I get punched...
we re humans  we re trash.  that is just how it is    -mm 2022
not all social media is equally censorious. I hear gab is very free speech and has a copy of trump s twitter account.
well  I like the shirt  very cute
just because you asked for the view about tattoos... yes your body is a temple. the meaning of that  is that it was created to glorify God since he is our creator and we worship him just like in a temple made out of stone. we are to respect it and honor it and maintain itsacred. tattoos are a way of scarification as well. you are putting ink and heavy metals in your skin with needles. tattoos hurt. and they fade because your body is trying to expell a foreign body that doesnt belong there. the argument that youre decorating your temple  when its actually his  is a weak position and a rationalization as a way to get around the commandment instead of following it and truly understand what it means. pharisees did that and you know how Christ felt about them... Im not judging you by the way  I like your tattoos  Im just trying to expand on this  but taking the commandment the correct way  we should not tattoo ourselves even if they are cool looking!
I got my post banned this same day last year for saying something about how covid shutdown made me feel like I was in a zombie apocalypse.
social media isn t real life.
thats crazy  they need to chill the f out!

I love how these soft-headed tyrants think anything online can constitute violence
honestly its pretty dumb for instagram to scold you for a shirt thats honestly pretty funny let alone one that looks fantastic on you as well  plus if you were inciting violence  I have a feeling it would be way more obvious but I dont see you to be the violent type
you have the freedom to say anything you want... as long as its what we want you to say.
ok! challenge accepted!
I was wondering if they took.this down would they take down a kiss me Im irish shirt.
instagram and facebook are so full of shit. they could both be rag-dolled around  like what hulk did to lokI and I wouldn t have any sympathy for them.

pinch for a punch  do you have any idea how many people are wiiing to go for that trade. anyway keep on booming
I think Im more offended that you shop at hot topic  p.
tatoos are fine!
if people in power worried about more important things the world would be that much more marginally better.
we are living in an era of snowflakes now  such a shame!
I lost my instagram account for changing my phone  .
so instagram is opposed to self defense for young women . . .
@crazy harry - biboa s theme  sounds like you need music when you fight him gets u in the zone
butters on south park pinched a girl at school for not wearing green and was arrested for being a sexual predator. as usual the show predicts an unfortunately soon to be true reality.
4 11 fist bump . question everything.
I got rid of cable and most streaming because I could get more entertainment for free on youtube.  if comcast wasn t making people pay 300 dollars a month for all their channels  I would seriously stop watching youtube and go back to cable.  thats how bad it is now. they ve made me want comcast ffs. unreal
people are just becoming more sensitive these days.
facebook and instagram come out against female empowerment  hmmmm... lol
yeah.... you should definitely take that off lol
self defense from a comment on a shirt........yea lol
yeeahh  these people like to pinch  poke and otherwise grope whoever they want whenever they want...
instagram  model .
anyone recommend a good vanilla ale
remember when you had the freedom of speechpepperidge farm remembers
there is no standard  accept the political progressive  we support the current thing ...    if convenient love the outfit and headband  on point!
go boom
who is going around pinching ppl like tf.
you are easy on the eyes
well  who cares what instagram or any other social media platform say or does  media thrives whether you give it good attention or bad attention. the point is  stop playing the attention game and things will get better.
p.s. im irish and I approve my last msg. back off haters.
apparently I like violence.
how the fuxk is warning someone of the consequences of an action taken wrong
if you had posted  pinch me and I ll punch you  putin  - they would have allowed your post.  all of this nonsense is why everyday I want to remove warning labels off of everything. those that dont learn to not touch the hot stove  well....
Imean  its green  so seems justified now  if it was a black tee   you had no green on then it might be a different story.
are facebook and instagram run by the same company they are completely on the left
wth mark zuckerberg s wife boyfriend was mad with you melonie
I delete instagram its pointless
scolded for what looking very attractive which you always do by the way  thats just ridiculous
I cantake a punch lol.
commenting to feed the algorithm
this is getting out of control
I dont care for the Christian stuff but if it means I get to see an actual strong female character on screen  i.e you  I ll take it with the little bit of preaching.  edit  this is coming from a male as well.
thats dumb I have seen far worse on instagram this is ridiculous.
just get a shirt that changes the word  you  to  putin . problem solved  problem staying solved. lol
no pinching .
ok so repost your shirt with the caption  my message to putin
biased community guidelines
as an atheist  happy green day
God bless you. hope your channel explodes with  subscribers.
thats a warning. wth...
seems like a concerted effort to hurt your channels. like  they are like they always have been selectively enforcing rules.
you so cute!!!!booooom!
ok so being creepy  lol so I know what I need to do so you punch me. you know what I like. lol but for real  um what is wrong with thatshirt  I think it is funny. ok we all know Im a bad person.

kitty!!! I saw the kitty at the start!!!
is instagram your mom   or like your 3rd grade teacher also Im definitely going to pinch you.
you look too good for those garbage sites anyway. you ought to take it as a compliment
is this a byproduct of automation
some people say  social media was a mistake  I kinda disagree with that comment  what make me agree is  social media ruled by an extremely vias side is a mistake

ugh. insert I dont want to live on this planet anymore gif.
big tech decides who we can make hate speech about. riiiiight. alt tech anyone
I bet if itsaid punch a conservative it will not be flagged
my culture is not your drinking holiday!
sup  boomer
nope
not to mention everyone is now a sensitive little flower that cant stand that anyone might have a strong opinion that is opposed to their own.
too hot for instagram
how is your shirt violent
ah ha so there are two of us who watch you hmmm
post removed for violence..     seriously  how dumb canthese people get
instagrim is a cesspit of double standards.
violently sexy
hella flexin
no one needs an assault shirt...  -
nice
hey mel. somone is trying to hack you.
its time we took a closer look at what happend in the usa  during wwii.

you dont put bumper stickers on a ferrari.
the only answer is free speech  complete free speech. even things that you dont like
people love fake outrage.  wouldn t be surprised is most of the people complaining dont actually care just like causing trouble
woo woo!
this is absurd...
people have become so soft. I swear people just look for shit to be offended by
big tech  ie   the thought police want defenseless mindless sheep to lead around. they can get rekt! we texans dont roll like that.
I have a solution. write putin at the bottom of thatshirt

instagram is clearly promoting the dehumanization of women... by supporting chads pinching them without consent.pft.
@melanie mac go boom you are not calling for violence against the correct people.
just a little pinch
looks like you have some stalkers looking for anything to f with you   what sad sad people .  the mindset yeesh.
a shirt of all things is considered for violence  good God we have failed as a species lol
all social media is trash.
but youre missing the wider point which is if you look at everything they said regarding violence and their policies right now or before or will the after they re all not followed by them and all done on political lines
stop irish hate
how idiotic! I try to be a good person but I am also not above punching someone in the face if they annoy me
internet people are getting weaker and weaker because of this woke people.
phew wee   d
press 1 if you came here to simp.
what a crock of bs from instagram .
pinch me.
I got strike on facebook for saying santa not gay
if itsaid you d punch a conservative it probably would of been ok.
censorship is stupid. kinda like sheeple.
if someone touches you  its automatically assault.  it doesnt matter what anyone else says  its a crime to touch someone who didnt ask you to. you obviously couldn t sue for damages  as theres no damages in a pinch or a hug. but  that doesnt matter to the law.  so  they are now breaking the law by inciting violence against women  which is also a hate crime  as they are saying its not ok to defend yourself when someone puts their hands on you.  in fact  they are saying you aren t even allowed to say that you will defend yourself  which is worse.  and that means that zuck is actually saying women dont have the right to even speak out about hate crimes against them.now  in all seriousness   we all know why they did it.  youre a conservative  with a following  and even worse youre attractive.  so youre a huge target. you ll be silenced  censored  and shadowbanned anyway they can  forever.  because we no longer live in a free and open world  and we never will again.
less  less.  touching is not a crime. the touching with specific intents can be a crime. if I tap you in your shoulder to  call your attention about your wallet that fell into the ground  it is not a crime as  hundreds of other  reasons to touch someone.there is no law on most of the world that  say something as stupid as  touching someone  is a crime . laws are written about the intent and context.
gee... wont someone think of the children...  crickets ... ok lets move on... nice shirt though...
them allowing hate speech against russian soldiers is dumb  its not like the soldiers get a choice to go to war  yea some might to bad things but that doesnt mean all of them are doing it. like what s happening over their sucks but blaming all the russians is stupid. and yea thatshirt is not controversial at all  its classic irish
as a born and bread guy from ireland I take no offence by your  t shirt   also not  religious.... but keep your faith  mel . I dont need to believe  to find  help in some of the  religious stuff you say.
what s a joke
before I forget iraq still hadn t got clean drinking water 20 years later. I am not right wing or left wing Im my wing.
so .... you got taken down for violence.... for wearing a shirt that tells people touching you without your consent would warrant you self defending yourself   I thought we weren t supposed to encourage people touching eachother without consent! this is a warning! like no trespassing!
it may be violence but cant we recognise there are appropriate uses for violence  please question who decides what qualifies as misinformation  offensive content cos they re likely as qualified if not less qualified than you are.
the woke mob has no sense of humor everything is taken literal a funny shirt is now offensive common sense is somehow ignored most best example on youtube is movie reactor the very woke mary cherry also a gamer reacted to mel brooks spaceballs  a parody of star wars she was triggered so bad thatshe branded mel brooks one of most jewish film maker of all time antI semitic God help protect us from people like that
yo wtf   u
I love how an innocent and fun shirt for st patties day can bring out all the fascist beatdown and think its connected to wars in the world. omg.companies have to grow up
Im guessing you dont know many ukrainians.
lol. you d think somebody actually reviews posts before taking them down. but that will be too much work for snowflakes.
hell  I am permanently gagged by twitter  for saying that a guy who rode a horse to death should have the same thing done to him.  targeted violence  I stand by my comment. apparently twitter loves animal abuse
melonie  if youre reading this comment  I wanna know  who is responsible for this garbage
bell a rus I ans  all one word.
soft
pinch
these are the same people thatstill think trump incited violence on jan 6th. we should expect nothing less
if you were  a land whale it would have been stunning and brave
thats racist  dont they know thats a old  irish tradition to get drunk and punch
if your opinions were different... that picture with thatshirt would have been promoted as  female empowerment tattoos in the Bible. isaiah 44 5some will say   I belong to the Lord  others will call themselves by the name of jacob still others will write on their hand   the Lord s  and will take the name israel.revelation 19 11-16 I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse  whose rider is called faithful and true. with justice he judges and wages war.his eyes are like blazing fire  and on his head are many crowns. he has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.he is dressed in a robe dipped in blood  and his name is the word of God.the armies of heaven were following him  riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen  white and clean.coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations.  he will rule them with an iron scepter.  he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God almighty.on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written  king of kings and Lord of Lords.
oh no!  you shop at hot topic.  time to unsubscribe.
sup
yeah that always makes social media and press in general believable. so threatening putin on sm is fine but wearing a t-shirt like yours is bad  are you kidding me dont get me wrong Im not in the least bit concerned about putin  but either something is wrong or it isn t...you cant allow peoples lives being threatened in one case and call it an offense or even a crime in the other. double-standards serve no one! thats an absolute perversion of free speech.
so non violent shirt bad but death calls to russian soilders good   what happened when we hit 2020 different common sense get flipped upside down. also dont worry about the russian people putin made piracy legal to combat the netflix thing lol
you keep saying no one is good but I haven t found that verse yet. we are all born with sin but we re not born evil  just imperfect and forever flawed. where is that verse you believe says no man is good
tattoos are unholy and sinful! tell that to the knights templar who have the cross tattooed on their chest.  the marine corps who have the logo tattooed on them.  the navy seals who have the anchor on them.  just admit that you personally dont like them and stop bringing God into this.
hey melonie mac  you complain about censorship yet I was just removed without warning from your discord for arguing with trump supporters. nice hypocrisy!
romans 3  10-12
@melonie mac go boom  thanks
@sketchasaur rex  on the other hand there is matthew 12 35   the good person out of his good treasure brings forth good  and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. so  are there good people or not  as far as Im concerned  yes  there are. and we are certainly not all  trash .
@joe narrf  exactly! we are all imperfect and have to strive for good and refute evil  just doing nothing is closer to sin and evil than it is good so we must strive for it.
@sketchasaur rex  or in other words  the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.  not a Bible verse of course  but this phrase sounds much more reasonable to me than  no one is actually good and all humans are trash.
@melonie mac go boom  I think you take it completely out of context. start over from romans 1 for who is not good. none of those that paul is speaking of anything but hypocrites  self-righteous fools that dont fear God and profit off the religious and other men.no  it doesnt say all men  it refers to all these men are not good.
