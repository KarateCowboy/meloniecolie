if studios want lara croft to be successful then they need to hire melonie as head of production.
Ive always felt that lara croft is at her best when there is a sense of discovery to go with the action and adventure.
I think the idea of being alone on an adventure in some remote part of the world is far more suspenseful than like what we usually get these days.
your videos are so good  you are dead on with your critiques. well thought out and thoroughly explained. also there s just something about how you talk thats fun to listen to.
look at how well top gun did. audiences would clearly love an action packed classic lara movie. it doesnt need any woke bullshit  she s just the ultimate female badass. dont weaken her with by making her needy  vulnerable  romantic  or emotional.
start off with a team with high powered guards on some kind of hunt. have them come across the ancient ruin that will be the main focal point. have something take out the guards and have one of the team escape. have that team member contact laura and have her take the job. this would allow her to raid the area  take out the monsters  avoid the traps and pitfalls  and solve the puzzles. it would be awesome action adventure and doesnt need to have people outside of the setup and conclusion.
that had a  if you love something  let it go  vibe. hopefully embracer will restore the brand and netflix isn t all we can look forward to.
having watched cutscenes from the older games  its obvious that lara croft is supposed to be a female james bond  with indiana jones mixed in  but he himself was obviously inspired by james bond   but of course without the whole usurping the bond character like they tried in that last movie where they killed him.
miss mac Imust thank you you gave me the push to give carnivore a go. started  it at the end of may  and since then Ive lost 25 pounds l. aslo reduced my drinking of hard liquor from 4 days a week to 1 day. something that I didn t think possible after getting out of the military but with progress it maybe possible quit drinking altogether.I thank you and will pray for you and wish you the best blessings that can be given. and lastly  would you kindly continue being good and staying safe.    semper fidelis.
make tomb raider great again!! -melonie mac  probably
tomb raider is just a mess at this point  unifying timeline with netflix stories will even make things messier. continuing the stories of the reboot will be awful  lara croft chasing trinity to acquire back her father s companies and along the way she will discover  ooohh  so much secrets and artefacts. what a stupid story to tell.
I agree that the rebooted tomb raider movie sequel being dead is probably a good thing. I also agree that lara should be a loner most of the time  but I did like lara being paired with zip in tomb raider chronicles. lara has a sharp wit  and it was cool having her verbally spar  with him during the final levels. I also liked lara s butler. as for the alicia vikander movie  I thought the actress did a good job  but I remember thinking the script was lacking. spoilers my favorite moment from the movie was the end  when lara s hair was braided and she held up the pistol and said she ll   take two.
clint eastwood didnt need a sidekick... lara croft doesnt need one either!
you say exactly what im thinking  the  katniss everdeen  made me laugh I feel the franchise now is a bit of a mess  and I start to believe the peeps behind tr also have no idea where to go from here. amen to you sis!
Imiss the top cow comics. dark horse dropped the ball at the end there.
I like all 3 of the tomb raider films personally. I didn t think any of them were masterpeice films but they were solid.
I irl laughed when you said let the netflix show flop lmao. its so true its gonna be so bad if its gonna be a bff mary sue adventure with jonah and zip  which is sad but something to be expected with the current mischaracterisation of lara
just make melonie mac play lara croft in the next film. and all will be well and good.
@melonie  I think its so awesome  you kept with the natural curls going on!  I for one think it adds some flair.  lookin good!  and keep  up the great work!
there has to be at least one english crossfit girl who can act that would make a fine lara.
I d be down with having melonie play lara croft. alicia vikander just doesnt fit the role at all.
as much as I love mel s loyalty and commitment to the classic lara croft character  she s a bit off base when it comes to adapting thatsame character to film. one of the reasons classic lara works so well is because she was designed specifically to be a video game character. take the thief series for example. in thief  you the player sneak through levels and steal as much loot as possible. so the thief garrett is a misanthropic loner type who steals because a  he needs money to pay his landLord and b  because its something he s good at. he fits the profile of the type of person who would actually go around robbing snooty rich people surrounded by hopelessly incompetent guards. in tomb raider  you the player have to navigate 3d worlds and search for artifacts and shoot things that threaten to kill you. so lara herself is this strong independent type who is driven by thrillseeking and is obsessive about her field. for garrett and lara  they work so well as video game characters because their goals and the player s goals are the same.when it comes to film adaptations  the audience is cut out of the loop as far as the characters  motivations  so they need something else to go on. you can still have the main character keep their original game persona  like lara s obsession causes her to alienate those close to her and even put people in danger  like in shadow . or like garrett s complete disregard for asking any questions about his jobs or his contacts  which results in him getting mixed up in much bigger and scarier things than he would ever have cared to  and eventually paying a very personal price for it.  but just remember the protagonists cant exist in a vacuum. you often need to add other characters to act as foils to the main character or add in an audience surrogate to react or be affected by their choices. movie characters need at least a few personal relationships in order for their character growth to mean anything  and to add some stakes beyond  save the world from magic sky beam.  Im not saying the current movie pitch is the right way to do things  but it takes a competent film maker to make a competent film  and all the same ingredients are necessary to make a video game adaptation than they are for any other movie.
considering the people who have been in charge of adapting video game characters to film  you could only do better with someone like melonie at the helm. even considering thatshe may be somewhat off base. at the very least she d be loyal stay true to the character of lara croft.  and she d be more open to ideas and criticism from fans like her. unlike the jokers adapting pretty much anything these days who s only goal is to push social messaging and gender ideology.
@annihilated481  the first and second tomb raider movie nailed lara s character imo. so its not hard to get the character right or the vibe right for the films. they can work. its just the survivor era really wouldn t work that well.
exactly
whilst it might seem like these people dont know what they are doing its still a job that can easily be messed up by anyone yet alone someone that has no idea what hollywood is all about.
@senseofreality  ever heard of punctuation s
@jeffrey mercado  its the internet not a term paper.
@zippity zop  true. but proper grammar helps to get ones point across if they want to be understood.
I noticed that with many films and shows. you just cant have anything less than an ensemble cast these days  and there needs to be at least 2 people on screen at almost every given moment. feels like studios desperately want to avoid any semblance of appearing like some  art house indie film  with a minimalist cast. if the script is good  then itshouldn t matter  but given the track record of game movies  bad scripts are pretty much the standard  so they need to compensate with big name charisma.
@jeffrey mercado  its punctuation  not  punctuation s . you wouldn t use a apostrophe for that.plus properly speaking its singular  the art of punctuation  as opposed to  punctuation marks  which are plural.if youre going to be  that guy   you might as well be accurate.
@annihilated481  agreed  any life action who wants to do it right has to make sure the actress looks like classic lara. of which to my opinion only angelina jolie was and still is the most autentic live action actress who portrayed lara. so it has to be an actress that looks simular  plus dito acting skills. cause she also nailed her graceful yet cocky loner go get attitude.
@senseofreality  I know what youre saying but these people are already messing up everything. look at resident evil on netflix. I ll put money on it that the tomb raider end product would be much better with her leading.
thank you so much
samus aran is better
@enigmatistic  well  if its a competition.elen ripley and sarah conner are two of the best protagonists ever  not just for being females. both start out soft and effeminate  scared and out of their league. both become badasses by the second movie  cutthroat and strong but foiled by their motherly instincts. their greatest strength  and greatest weakness  is that maternal emotion and drive.but lara is none of that  she s above the emotions and motivations of mere mortals.
just make a tomb raider game. thats it. study the source material. stick to it. ain t hard. problem is there s always some  message  they want to push  or they want to have creative control apart from the source material to push agendas or tweak the character to make them the way they want them to be rather than the way they are. any direct sequel to that last monstrosity is going to be doa.
@enigmatistic  samus aran doesnt hold the record for most recognizable female video game character ever or the best selling video game franchise with a female lead  tomb raider currently at 88 m I believe metroid being at only 21m.
thatsounds like a horror movie
she s better than bond. bond s weakness is always women  lara is just sort of aloof to or above romance.
exactly. she was supposed to be cool  strong and feminine like how bond is cool  strong and masculine.
yesss that is amazing  I am so happy it worked out so well for you! and thank you so much for the prayers  it really means a lot
better if they did a 1 of stand alone where lara goes to antarctia to find an alien relic that is buried deep underground  in ruins....
I had no issue with lara hiring a support team. there was occasional comic relief  and never any doubt about who was in charge. outsourcing grunt work seemed in line with a quasi-aristocratic character.
@chaosinfusion  from what I remember playing the tomb raider legend games  her support team was always there and the characters weren t very interesting. the first five games had scarier levels because lara was alone which  in turn  made her seem more tough. thatsaid  I liked zip in tomb raider chronicles because he and lara challenged each other and they had great banter with each other  which allowed you to see more of lara s personality. my ideal tomb raider game would sprinkle other characters like him and the butler in  but still leave lots of room for lara to be on her own. maybe she could make sarcastic and funny comments to herself  too.
the reboot was really good and a good origin story
I love alister but the legend s helpers talking nonstop to lara plus rebooted zip s remarks in england and nepal levels... oh God. another reason I d rather guardian of light and tra tru. even though I d rather lara as a loner like in classics- lara was with chase carver in the comics and he was the worst idea especially when he was using her in comics and was a casino addict  yet people still say that kurtis and jonah are the worst ones sigh
@kyle day  are you talking about the most recent reboot  that was actually my first tomb raider game. I liked it a lot  and it was what made me go back and play all the others. playing through the others though showed me that they changed the character a lot in the reboot. I liked the rebooted lara in the first game  but she wasn t the same character anymore  really.
@sygos  no Im talking a out the movie reboot and the reboot game was not the same as the original games o preferred them. why did u like them.
@kyle day  oh  ok. I dont remember the movie s origin story well enough to comment on that  but the reason I liked the original games was because I liked the original lara croft character a lot and because of the exploration. I loved that the gameplay was challenging but fair  I liked that the secrets were difficult to find  and I really liked the climbing and acrobatics in that game. I dont like modern game s climbing systems which dont require any thought or planning.
@chaosinfusion  I can see the logic with that  but lara was supposed to be an adrenal and adventure junkie who liked things to be as dangerous as possible  so her hiring a team to help her with that kind of lessens that aspect of her character.
@sygos  ok did u do any of the puzzles on the originals without cheating also what s your favorite game and what did u like about the lara croft character the problem with modern games for years is there more about cinematic movies than focusing on gameplay as much  rather than a mix of both
@kyle day  I didn t cheat on any of the puzzles as far as I remember. are you asking which tomb raider game is my favorite  probably the first. I liked the story the most in that one and it had all the necessary gameplay elements. I find lara interesting and entertaining. she s a rich woman who enjoys adventures instead of relying on her money. I like thatshe isn t interested in being proper and doesnt mind offending people  despite what her parents probably taught her. I agree that modern games focus too much on the cinematic experience rather than gameplay  and that thats a bad thing. what s your favorite game and what do you like about lara
amen!
yup
@sygos  hI I have not played the originals in years will do eventually again it was mostly because of the puzzles found them really difficult what was the most difficult puzzle for you.  what did u think of the remake of tomb raider 1
@sygos  the last one I played that I remember is legend that is probably my favorite.
@sygos  when did u first start playing tomb raider.
@sygos  also tomb raider 4 of the originals.
@sygos  what I found interesting about the originals is also the music.
@kyle day  thats true! the first game s menu theme is beautiful!
@kyle day  I dont remember which puzzle was the most difficult  honestly. its been a few years since I played through them. Imostly preferred the original tomb raider one  but I liked some things about the remake. I remember enjoying the combat. that game was too easy  so Imade it more difficult for myself by making itso that if I got hit by an enemy once I had to restart the combat encounter. the thing I liked the most about the legend games was the collectible outfits. I thought that was a good idea  and it was fun to play with lara croft s clothing styles.
@kyle day  I probably played them between 2014-2015.
the movie was trash  in general. I couldn t care less about it not getting a sequel. its a good riddance. we didn t ask for it and we dont need it.
@machta shmacta  I remember really looking forward to that movie  but ultimately being disappointed. too bad it wasn t nearly as good as I was hoping it d be.
I dunno if she can pull off the british accent though lol
I didn t even know there was a 2018 tomb raider.  tells you all how much I care about hollypood.
oh boy  I hope its not bad lara needs a good reboot.
I vote for melonie to be lara croft.
I d love to see them reboot lara again if they can get the characterization right  but can we not do the whole  rehash of the origin story   lara doesnt really need that and it gets old after a few reboots. indy didn t get an origin story until his 3rd movie and we could have done without it then too.
my favorite tomb raider movies are the original two.
so what would a tv series with lara croft be like without a supporting cast
the best way going forward is letting the new game set the base  then they can move forward. there s nothing worst then not knowing what you want to do with lara  and I think that is why she is not as relevant as she once was. crystal do not know what to do with her
by the sound of it  tomb raider netflix adaptation aspires to live up to the title. the 2nd half  that is.
at this point  I am pretty much considering any type of movie sequel or continuation dead until I hear it is actually in production.
great vid melonie! besides you  who would your dream person be to play lara craft  or would you rather they not make anymore movies  plus thatshow you were talking about does sound dumb.
well said as always!
in more recent news the movie license for tomb raider is up for grabs and alicia vikander is no longer playing lara croft since mgm doesnt hold the movie rights anymore since they took too long to green light it.
if the new film is released by the new writer and director thatshe s not pressured to taint the telling of lara  tale with  the message  but what film released these days isn t tainted by  the message  although  I hear top gun is a good film. haven t seen it yet.
I just want tomb raider 1 game in film form with alicia still as lara  and charlize theron as jacqueline natla  or sharon stone if they cant afford theron
they should ve gotten paul w.s. anderson to direct and have milla jovovich as lara croft.
I think they re pushing the buddy adventure because it makes it easier to film a story around it  solo lara croft makes for a good game  but it would limit a film.
the problem with tomb raider is that the writers and directors are looking the success of the newer games like uncharted and they wanna make it more like those
make two movies one with reboot lara and classic lara and see which one is more successful
it is quite the ironic formula for the croft franchise not to use excessive nostalgia bait and fan service to ruin its shows or movies. but instead  to drastically change and bastardize the themes and characters of the ip.
I see the notification  I click video  I see your cat in the bottom left corner  I like immediately
like man vs wild  with.. tomb raiding
hayley atwell would be great

the northman   top gun are the two movies I saw and wasn t  filled with the message.
indiana jones didn t need buddy adventures  lara croft doesnt either
@melonie mac go boom  maybe Im misunderstanding the term   but he did always get saddled with companions in his adventures though  ie short round  willie  marion   his father... I dont count anything after last crusade   which is sort of the same thing.  would you object to her getting saddled with a companion  I suppose there is an element of wanting her to be more friendly less mercenary when it comes to adventuring as well.
@melonie mac go boom  actually how would you do character interactions with laura croft  or would you not even try because I could watch a movie that was just straight action  but Im not sure how well that would mesh with a platformer.
yuuup
you know what would be cool I d thatscreen play doesnt get greenlit they should make it into a comic book. I believe most non greenlitscreenplays should become books comics
make interactive movies. thats the way to make video game based movies. they need a level of audience interaction because being involved in the plot is integral to all games with a good story that movie companies wanna turn into a film. they need to stop making big budget theatrical releases  partner with a good streaming service  and make interactive films and shows. its quite simple when you think about it.
I agree completely with everything you said
why dont they have hayley atwell play lara in live-action  she s definitely got the curves for it and Im sure they could train her to build the muscle. if they think she s too old  gemma arterton would be a good choice. even though she isn t an oscar-worthy actress  I think rosie huntington-whiteley with dark hair would look the part and could give a serviceable performance. I dont know why they want to cast a scrawny girl next-door type like alicia vikander as this character. Im sure the most popular fan casting is probably emily blunt  but I dont think she has the right build.
if deadline is bringing this movie up  chances are the movie is in development hell. and deadline is running out of hollywood news.
why do they keep on doing this to lara... there has to be someone out there that can save tomb raider.
if a tomb raider movie is to succeed as tomb raider first  they really have to make it not look like a bad video game in the first trailer. they have to make it a sick  ass kicking  tomb raider movie that does not fall into the same failures of other game movies. lara is bigger than all that bs  make it an event.
since the star had the baby they should name the next movie  tomb baby !
just cast melonie as lara  case closed.
what happened to vicky arnold  bc she writted lara croft background back then at core design era.tomb raider misses her stuff for classic lara croft nowdays  but I wonder if vicky is just tired by personal reasons and til this day didn t had appeared in public.
love you mel and Ive followed you for at least 6 or 7 years   since whenever you started doing gs tv  so this point of criticism comes from love. I def wish you d go back to the old go boom format. I get burn out for sure but I feel like the nerdy commentary would fit just at home on your other larger channel anyways. felt like the social commentary  namely the verse of the day  was loved by so many and its just silly to have two channels at this point if youre making the same sort of videos. your other channel has a higher sub  therefore impression count anyways  if its growth that youre worried about. especially since your content almost has always bordered on the vlog category. I cant imagine your analytics are working against you all that much on either channel. people love you for you and I just hope youre not changing things to bend to lame normies and this is a new direction that you genuinely want. anyways  much love thanks for always putting out great stuff
wow  its been ages since I got a notification of a new vid from ya.  cause I checked back on your page and you have been pumping them out pretty regularly     still subbed and bell activated still... hmmm
so its not happening sounds like...damn
thanks mel.. u eco the voice of so many !!
melonie should be the director n ceo of tomb raider franchise
ha! when laura and zip call you to go with them to investigate the secret lost mayan city of gold you ll be running.
welp looks like the sequel is cancelled now because alicia is out and different studios are fighting over the rights to tomb raider!
hey melonie I just want to say that if the movie company want to make this new tomb raider movie so excited and more adventure for us to love and like then they need to get someone who is more active and exciting to play laura croft part in new tomb raider movie  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say bout this video and make a comment to this video  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
I do not trust anybody doing things right so Imake everything myself  so is lara
what movie now  damn  forgot it ever happened... and I just checked  got recommended the jolie movie instead  that one  I did remember
probably because they still trying to make it like the reboot lara.even now the industry has very little respect towards videogames in general and they often behind the curve who still try to follow the marvel formula. but the reboots were trying very hard to be like movies so thatseemed to appeal to them.
thatsomeone would of course be me jamiecloughgaming  only ppl have to start watching my tomb raider lets plays first  yeah thats all I ask folks! they were some of my best work posted 2 years ago  but with hardly any views.
I second that.
she disappeared. I dont even blame her  the community is toxic
thank you so much for the feedback  it means a lot. for the most part I feel like this style is the same  I just removed the reading comments and verse of the day segments. partially because they made my videos 3x as long  and also because it was a lot of off topic stuff which would ultimately hurt my channel in the algorithm. I am considering doing a weekly comments  verse of the day video though  perhaps that would help balance things so that everyone who preferred the old videos will still have that    also on my discord we have a prayer group which is amazing!
that d be an awesome idea and I definitely think it ll appease everyone. but either way I ll always be watching. like I said I was more worried you were changing based on external factors from haters or something and would never want that. and yeah Ive been to the prayer group almost every single week since itstarted  look forward to it every week tbh.
yt notifications suuuck
@melonie mac go boom  well I have some catching up to do.
strange  I really do like the tomb raider reboot. guess Im in the minority. oh well.
doesnt matter not like I would ever watch another tomb raider with a titless wonder as lara.
I haven t even watched the movie. I ll stick with my angelina jolie tomb raider movies  they re classics.
haven t seen the 2018 movie  but I really like alicia vikander as an actress. she was awesome in ex machina among other things.
doa I dont think they made a movie with them yet... realize you mean dead on arrival not dead or alive game
how about a new tomb raider game  with the classic laura
cradle of life was so under rated. I loved lara killing her boyfriend to save the world.
alicia can get it all day
give the franchise to someone else. crystal dynamics does not know what makes lara croft lara croft and a tomb raider game tomb raider. I haven t felt fulfilled by any tomb raider game crystal has made. I was always left with a feeling of somethings not right or somethings missing. it was especially very disappointing with how they were unable to recreate the magic of the original game with their reimagining  not remake  version anniversary. they couldn t even give us stylish cutscenes  laras tr1 animations  a similar puzzle and platforming system  original music  the characters were changed  and some of the best levels were completely dumbed down  smaller in scale  or multiple parts cut out. some of my favorite moments and locations were removed or changed. many of the parts that made the game memorable or stuck with you back in the day they couldn t even figure out see what they were and recreate them. where are all the boulders  swinging blades  etc. we had little of them. they just were completely ignorant that the way the original game was made is what made it great and they recreated very little of those aspects. itshould of been clear with the low sales numbers of anniversary and underworld that crystal is unable to make a superior and actual tomb raider game that gets people hyped. good or decent game scores doesnt mean its a good tomb raider game. even aod gave me much more satisfaction. at least lara felt like lara in that game and the game had a strong sense of mystery and wondering what s gonna happen next and lara was always very interesting.
the dream is collapsing.
of course they re gonna make the animated story about lara working with zip and jonah. gotta get those sweet sweet diversity points. and in doing that  they re changing the story from being about lara  to actually fitting their political agenda. I bet you they re also gonna make one of them gay!  I hate how wokeness is destroying lara s legacy.  they re using her image to sell their ideas. what the f happened to good entertainment
eidos and the smith brothers wrecked tomb raiderthey wanted thatsweet sweet moolah every xmas and by golly they got it. but at a great cost. and that cost is something tomb raider never could and never will ever recover from no matter what you do with it.
I saw an article saying the movie is to rebooted a gain as mgm has lost the rights to tr.
tomb raider requirements  british girl with a funny accent.long braided hair.dual pistols.selfish and overconfident personality.likes to do things her own way.is this really that hard to accomplish for the movie producers and game devs
oh look  more lara croft salt lol
what s hilarious is that Ive had idiots try to say classic laura was highly degrading.but really if they want tomb raider to stay they need to bring back how the controls use to be.improved sure  but make the game about climbing and jumping with infinite ammo pistols
I thought I was going to see an interesting video about an opinion about the second film and I find myself in the middle of a concentrate between a recitation of an incomplete news and an opinion about  the reboot nobody wanted  it was very uninteresting Imust admit. here s my own thoughts on the subject   Im waiting for the next film because I think alicia vikander is an excellent actress who deserves a second chance to play lara. she seems to genuinly enjoy the character and although the first film was not necessarily a masterpiece of originality I liked it for its simple first adventure feel. I think amazon are waiting to see what distribution deal they will use to release the film  we could be heading for an all digital release . otherwise if the second film doesnt happen  wich I hope not   why not make a tv series out of it  with the benjamin gates spin off coming to disney   and alicia already in irma vep  plus theotthers series made with videogame franchises in mind I think there would be a real potential to have a lara croft adventure series  other than in the animated format  with something based around trinity and a series of artifacts in diverse locations of the word. perhaps we could see her evolution as well in flashbacks.maybe when the deal with embracer is done we ll have more informations  because they seems attached to transmedia to live up their franchise and since tomb raider is currently their biggest it might play a role in the future.one thing is for sure  alicia herself said in an interview with the swedish website moviezine thatshe will resume training when the film is greenlit.I just love the dedication of this actress.
I just hope the politics of lovecraft country dont bleed into the next tr movie.
how about thisif they want to change lara to be lgbtqna friendlymake her asexual and aromantic  because then they can focus it on the adventure  and because as you ve said yourself  classic lara cared more for adventure than companionship
I liked the newer actress that played laura. I just think the story wasn t that great.
just remake angel of darkness with updated graphics and gameplay. and if enough people buy in  do the original planned trilogy with lara and kurtis.
its not underrated  its a very boring film.

apparently so  they dont understand classic lara s personality and character traits. so many ways to describe her   witty  sarcastic  selfish at times  independent   clever. stands her own ground. strong wielded. doesnt let anything get in her way.  she can be sassy and a little emotional  doesnt let many people see that   weakness and lara likes to be incontrol  . lara is and always will have the hard stubborn personality as if she trusts you but not enough to get in her way. like your the player seeing her adventure  experiencing it but she s in control  whether that be she does good or bad things. she s unpredictable.  lara will also have typical traits like women from  nordic noir films.
@ollie atkinson  what they also do is just describe her  b88bz  dual pistols and braid  even though this isnt everything about classic lara
@seahawkerino  oh yeah deffo
this!!!
@melonie mac go boom  funny enough your praise for the classic games had me get ps1 tomb raider 1 and 2  just finished chapter 1 of tomb raider and it was a blast  I was genuinely surprised when it went from snow temple to lost world with a trex fight.the movement controls are very unique and are a ton of fun.what other tomb raider games would yourecommend for me to get as a new player  did they ever make any for ps2 also what tips to a new player to the classic games would you say
hehe. you must be new here...
@rivera harper  I aint  it was just a naive expression of hope. the movie recently got cancelled anyway.
@charming peasant  oh really  thank God!
I find vikander frustrating because she s very beautiful but completely wrong for the character of lara croft - at least the one that was popular  back before she was sanitised.
its a mess indeed  square literally tried to erase classic lara croft tomb raider at the anniversary as if she never existed. and pretended the reboots was the iconic franchise. I know reboot fans celebrate the sales numbers of the reboot games  and dont understand squares dissapointment. what these  new fans dont get is like any other big iconic franchise  its live blood are the toys  comics  merch  collectables etc etc. which collapsed almost instantly  due to  im thankful for that  the majority of the o.g. fanbase rejected everything that had to do with the reboots. something square didnt saw coming and of course was hoping that the  new  fans also would jump in  which they didnt.just as we have seen with star wars  she-ra and so many other iconic characters ip s  is that classic merch and variants that respect the o.g character s  still sells like hot cakes. while hardly anyone is interested in rebooted merch. though sadly in lara croft tomb raiders case due to it was the first and high profile hijacked franchise by third wave feminism  and she being their biggest symbol of evil. hardly any classic merch was made by square  who went full into the reboots....and failed spectacular like disney   wb are failling now.
melonie pls start at petition for tomb raider  bring lara back!
honestly  Im not interested in any of these movie or series! itseems no one of the producers today really has a clue of what lara croft tomb raider is all about. its all about making money! look of what the uncharted movie has become! dont misunderstand - its looking good  but they took scenes of all of the games from the past and put it together. this is so not good for a real fan like me.anyway  for me its important to get a new tr game which sticks to the classic ones  as I always said!thanks melonie for your great content!!!
I couldn t get myself to watch the reboot film cause I just had no interest in it.heck I never even watched its review but I wouldn t be surpised if it was bad. the reboot game time line in the end still sucks. the orignal games and the 3 legends games are still where its at.
the actress worked her ass off. all other things aside  I super respect her.
tv and movie characters have to be memorable. they need personalities  goals  weaknesses and relationships with other characters. even indiana and all the bonds had those things. so you want original lara who was a mary sue  had no discerning weaknesses  a robotic personality and you dont want her to have a supporting cast  you outta explain how that would work. you shouldn t just say  reboot lara bad  and call it a day.
but what is the source of this news by smashlara  I haven t seen this information on movie portals.
I did like alicia as lara    I think she brought thatsassy confident lara back- but it would be nice if the reboot story wasn t involved
wonder woman is misogynistic!chun lI is misogynistic!delete all these misogynistic tropes! no one in fiction is allowed to have bigger boobs than me  curvier bodies than me  and thiccer cakes than me!!!! someone needs to tell square enix that their personal insecurities are showing.
ketovore crushes your natural testosterone production  which hurts women too as testosterone is needed to produce estrogen. carb backloading  having a single carb-heavy meal in the late afternoon right after a workout  is far more efficient for fat loss and muscle growth without crippling your hormone levels.
I personally liked the vikander tomb raider. I found it more grounded   I liked it. but given how woke hollywood has gotten  any sequel would probably suck. its literally been several years since Ive felt like going to the movies  and it doesnt look like anything is going to change that. hollywood is dead set at destroying their brand. get woke  go broke.
lovecraft country writer makes tomb raider sequel with alicia wikander again hard pass...!
if the new tomb raider movie sucks are you going to auction off your lara statue  like you said ya just got to let it go
I enjoyed the 2018 tomb raider movie!
they can make x numbers of tomb raider movie but if lara croft aint in hot pants then its not tomb raider to me
there was a tomb raider movie in 2018 I forgot about it because it likely sucked just like the rebooted games while the original games will always be the classic superior lara croft thats my assessment.
I want a tomb raider movie that is moore like the old stuff. a movie to fans ! please !  without the wokeness ...!
this is getting canceled
what happened to your verse of the day  havnt heard any for a few weeks  lol
the best thing about the movie is alicia vikander and the stunt scenes. other than that its unremarkable.
movie was still boring!
explain how that would work  just play tomb raider 1-5  ya know  what actually made tomb raider iconic in the first place lol
this is a modern day woke attitude. people can be emotionally stable without a crutch.
@adanu191  what are you talking about  I had no idea fundamental storytelling is  woke  now.
no  my dtatues are from my love of the classic games. I have never been invested in the movies lol
@melonie mac go boom   lmao! what s a dtatues  I dont think I seen any of those in the background. jk
@melonie mac go boom  the classics are all we have in the end. franchises will crash and burn at some point..
amazon and  netflix already burn franchise with reboot with ideology nonsense with the message
if its netflix you know it will be woke trash with no respect for the original material.
melonie mac go messy hair lol
considering the direction that lazy and intellectually dead hollywood writers and directors are going now I would just rather there not be any new lara croft anything. having nothing is better than the garbage hollywood is pandering these days. at the rate things are going now its just a matter of time before brie larson is cast as lara. just wait. then its just obvious things have gone to the dark side. and Imean the awful dark side of reality  not the cool dark side of the force. I know most of you will understand that one.
how come you stopped doing the Christian portions in the videos lately
kitty
just once it would be nice if one of these movie studios hired an actual fan to offer insight and opinions. nope.
even the last tomb raider movie was not that great.
a movie about a shitty reboot with an actress that is the furthest thing from even reboot lara. wonder what went wrong
I already know its gonna be trash when they announced that black lady director lol
reboot tomb raider games are good games but not good tomb raider games
I kinda hated the vikander movie it was just a bad story so not looking forward to any new movies based on tomb raiderps I just dont like beanpole vikander as croft. the lady is a pretty good actress and I liked her in a lot of her roles but this just isn t her thing and lara needs to be recast badly. I d gladly go see a movie that was lone lara vs the dungeon temple cave ect ect
why when the last movie was so bad .
you know what they really should do  stop making movies about video games!!!
mentioning tomb raider legend as a favorite is not promising. thats not a tomb raider game. maybe its good this project fell through.
with the gap between the last movie and now  its a great opportunity to bring in the classic adult lara.  stop it with the ya  lara  light novel-esk bs.
sequel!  the first movie was complete garbage that just made some references from the game. and there was only one tomb throughout the whole thing. and after four years they decide to continue it
alicia vikander is too skinny. I prefer angelina jolie s depiction of lara croft. melonie mac can be lara croft s stunt double...
alicia is lara croft. sorry  jolie babe. you worked great at the time but alicia blows you out of the water  imho. no alicia  I no care. just the way I feel about future lara croft movie projects.
pls show cat
they were making my videos too long and also too off topic  thus would negatively impact my channel in the algorithm. but I still post verses on my insta stories and there s a weekly prayer meeting on my discord
well  we know its going to be trash because of the agendas the industry are constantly pushing. Im convinced it isn t possible in this day and age of hollywood to actually make a good tomb raider movie.
if they wanted a successful sequel  they would do well to drop the survivor storyline crap and do a movie based on the dagger of xian.  but of course its hollywood  and they would find some way to screw it up. guaranteed.
alicia put on mass for the role.
alicia is a great representation of survivor lara while angelina jolie is a perfect representation of classic lara. they play two totally different lara s cant really compare to totally different characters
classic movie lara is a expert hand to hand combatant  expert in majority of weapons  military trained  confident and sexy as fuck and very very no nonsense type of woman.while survivor lara is brand new to adventure and doesnt really know much yet so doesnt have the confidence  skills  or literally anything that the classic lara has
which by the way angelina s lara is a representation of at least 15  lara croft games. while alicia only represents 3 of the tr games. so you can argue that angelina is far more suited for the role and her version of the character is a good representation of the franchise
how bout trans laura!  lol jk jk
jonah was annoying
I really hope this is forever cancelled. misha green s lovecraft country was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. I hope she stays far  far  faaaaar away from all thing tr related. plus  she thinks legend lara is  classic era ... way to do your research.
there was a tomb raider reboot  what the hell  I literally heard nothing about this. the new girl looks so frail.I think angelina jolie was the better croft.
sup boomaloom.
your cat stole this show
alicia vikander is the worst lara croft of all time.
alicia vikander is the wroooooooooooooooooong actress.  they could do so much better
let it die. its not even real lara croft anyways. original lara to the core.
tomb raider is dead. if you have to let the franchise breathe and return in the future and to watch the animated tv show burn for what it is  then thats the definition of dead in the water.
the tomb raider film was such a disappointment.
lovecraft cuntry  was so bad.of course the writer is conna be awarded with a even more popula franchise to destroy.it will be garbage.
all of the movies have been subpar. even the angelina jolie movies. then again they should have cast rhona mitra as lara croft back then instead of jolie. and doing lara croft begins was not necessary. and thats what we got with movie  3.
boom   dislike  !!

they know this and they dont care.
