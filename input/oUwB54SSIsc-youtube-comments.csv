villain protagonist   capitalism   genocide simulator  wtf... none of those tags are on plague inc
you cannot be a champion of  diversity  and  inclusion  if you cannot tolerate people with different views and opinions. - zuby.
villain protagonists and a genocide sim sounds like a recipe for an amazing game
you know people are on something when they go after a fantasy game instead of trying to improve something in the real world.
I never saw a harry potter movie or read the books. the game actually looks amazing and was considering buying it. but thanks to the crazy crowd  I think Im gonna pre order it. thanks crazy crowd for convincing me.
I think we should add the  woke tears  tag...
either they re this dumb thinking this would stop being people buying it  or this was a 4d marketing plan that worked like a charm
this reminds me of an ad campaign for a chocolate bare a few years ago in the uk for yorkie bars. the slogan was  yorkies. they re not for girls . this was genius  cause it meant all the guys bought them  just because  and females bought them out of rage lol. the company sold so many haha
lol when melonie s channel becomes dark comedy. I couldn t do this keeping a straight face  you do it better than i!  this story gets better every day!
if we re being real here  every rpg is a  genocide simulator  in a way like  do they not grind in these games  or do they just defeat every new enemy once  then move on to a different enemy
I love that melonie is so wholesome she says  heck around and find out
this is honestly uplifting - the fact that a lot of millenials have been pre-ordering the game and not dismissing something they like just because a few in their generation or others are bitter and dont know how to have fun.lets go!but lol those tags xd
its kinda sad that these people are spending so much time directing their energy towards this  especially in such a negative way. harassing people  bullying people  doxing people etc  and when its all built on a lie meant to purposefully paint jk rowling as some horrible monster  simply for believing in basic biology  so that they can justify their hate. the fact that this is just one of their targets among every other person  statement  structure that drives them insane for no reason is crazy to think.its honestly pathetic and while I wouldn t consider myself religious  if demons did exist then the wokies are them human incarnate.
their hate just makes the game more popular  it just keeps getting funnier.
hey melonie. these people be crazy. I love the new tags  hope youre doing well
Ive never bought a game out of spite before  but this game might change that.
I originally wasn t interested in the game after it was announce way back when  but after all the news on it brought it back to my attention and I purchased out of spite... now that I own  Ive looked at it more and it actually looks really good. might gift some copies to friends later.
this is a honey trap.. we re all gonna buy the game and they re gonna force us to pick our pro nouns for the character we create.
the fact that they think that goblins look like jews just cause they deal in money itshows they will find problems where there are none and melonie are you going to playing atomic heart
j.k said it best herself. she says every time they try to cancel her wizarding world book sales go up . I pre ordered the delux edition tonight
toby! just a yt viewer nowadays or we gonna have a new vid from you at some point
bahaha!
yoooo its toby
kek ikr ! fucking wild man
have you heard from lyle recently  you should try to get into an oneyplays episode where you just sit in a room call ians haircut a bowl of bitch.
there not even on destroy all humans
Im not embarrassed  God I can never spell that word right without googling it  to admit Ive enjoyed quite a few genocide simulator games. mostly on flash web game sites like kongregate   armorgames.
bro
lol you d think they would.
facts! also love zuby!!!
the smallest minority on earth is the individual. those who deny individual rights  cannot claim to be defenders of minorities.
nah. if somebody is of the opinion that 1 1 4 or that my entire people are trash  all they re entitled to is my ire.
not to mention they re doing this to target jk rowling who has very little to do with the development of this game and actively trying to harm all the people who worked their tails off to make it like the game developers. they are truly pathetic people.
bravo
how could a champion of tolerance tolerate the intolerant
tolerance is at an all-time high  but peoples  tolerance of intolerance is super low. seems like every step of it is treated with the harshest fist  rather than the appropriate severity.
also  man  do I hope you do better.
toby! my first ever subbed to channel on youtube years ago.
bro I haven t seen your channel since your amnesia the dark descent days  youre one of the first gamers that got me hooked on it. glad to see youre still doing good.
it could pretty accurately describe an average game of civilization as well
looks at tags   huh  since when has harry potter been an old school d d game
plague inc ftw tho
toby lives
those tags could apply to any 4x game - stellaris  civilization  victoria...
oh my God!I haven t seen toby in...freaking years!this man has some humor. Imissed having you around.genuinely dont remember why you left  but hey  hope all is going well with you.had to click to see if it was really you and yeah it is.cool. peace my bro  and thanks for the good memories.
is it a real tobuscus
so accurate acusations hahaha
@hona leri  he got  falsely  metoo ed a few years before the movement started to pick up steam and people were experienced enough with those sorts of allegations to separate the real from the fake. same as projared if Im remembering correctly.
@melonie mac go boom  you are smart. I tought about the fact that noone on the right is ofensive but I newer heard anyone talking about it.
@darthjc4  him  zedscott and tetraninja .
too true!thatshould change  absolutelythose tags were made for plague inc.
plague inc is very fun little gamegenocide simulator fire
bro I saw these tags without knowing about the drama and was like  wtf is this game about  lmao
we need these tags on rimworld.
toby!! I hope you are doing okay these days!!
or payday jajajajaja
zuby is a really good guy. he helped me out when I lost my entire family within one year. I cant say enough good things about the man. he s the real thing.
@richard aaron  sorry  I was being sarcastic  Imeant no disrespect.
@albert nada retro  I didn t see anything disrespectful friend.
these people live in an echo chamber where they only hear their own voices
fuck  inclusion and diversity. my community matters  and we deserve to gatekeep and not be destroyed.
@blacklives orblackvotes  ahahahah  yeah  thinking racism is bad is so radical and extreme amirite  get real man
@daniel a.   if somebody is of the opinion that 1 1 4  well  you could tinker around with the numerical base you use. if you search long enough you d probably find one that results in 1 1 4. same principle as when you use binary or hexadecimal as numerical base instead of decimal. the intrinsic value wouldn t change  but the seen output would.also you could take an axiomatic approach to it and redefine the assumptions used. but yeah  you wouldn t be able to get to 1 1 4 as a valid result without lots of  useless  work  but yeah  I dont think the people believing in it understand the difference between changing the whole approach and abusing the current approach. just wanted to nerd out a bit.
sums it up.
so you d be ok with racists just being able to yell the n word all the time right
@hibarI kyoya  is that in hogwartz legacy  color me surprised.
its weird how those always go hand and hand  thats a really really great quote. I guess their argument is they are inclusive and diverse with skin color  which really just means less white people  and or less males.
@annoyedpanda  two ideas expressed that Ive never heard that blew my mind  and while I totally agree  the people we are fighting against never will  because they are really champions of people who are failures in someway. they are marxist  and they believe in equality of outcome means in equality of opportunity. if somebody has somebody has not the person who has only has because he took from the one who has not. which is why he has not.
not that most gamers even pay attention to the tags.
sounds like a gta game. xd
@ltnetjak  right  I keep forgetting steam even has tags. Im it reminded because world of warships keeps trying to incentivise me to assign tags and get premium for 1 day
I think that rimworld could. qualify for those
reminds me of the old  postal  game.   quitshootin .  Im already dead.   dark.
@asylum117 lol which kinda makes making gta 6  for the modern audience  very redundant if youre just gonna go on and commit murder. kinda ironic  no
prototype anyone
I love being evil in games lol
the moment I see villain protagonist in anything. its an instant buy for me.
these kinds of people have never improved anything in their lives
fr you dont hear them defend lgbtq people kids who get k  led jailed disowned in queerphobic countries Im of people who didn t get lucky and born in wrong and  dangerous country for me   instead they call you  something phobic if you speak about it but fictional characters are moooore important
they are doing both  actually. this is why we are losing the culture war  people in the centre and right dont do anything  dont infiltrate institutions from within to change them  dont build their own enterainment companies  etc  and yet wonder why things only get worse.
they re gonna be pissed if it even gets nominated for goty lol
@peachesandcream8753  no  most dont wonder that.
@just a guy on youtube   I heard in gta 6 they wont let you harm civilians Im not sure if thats true though
@ltnetjak  exactly  who actually pays attention to the tags of the game they re searching for  all most players  at least I do anyway  only care about the title and thr description of the game.
also  teeechnically villain protag isn t wrong since you have the option to go dark wizard... idiots should have done their research lmao
why save the day when I can just zap my problems away
sounds like that hatred game that got heat back in the day.
just sounds like plague inc. to me.
@edwin  wouldn t be surprised if true
sounds like a way to grieve the holy spirit that lives inside saved people.
it does. play something like overLord or dungeon keeper. they were fun.
except its going to be woke af
@asylum117 sounds like civilisation games
thats what I thought as well
isn t there a game about being a mass shooter  its called hatred I think  lots of people freaked out when it was announced but everyone forgot it like 3-4 weeks after release.
@thedemonyooshii  great games  love prototype
I love hatred I wonder if they ll be a gameplay mod called sjw genocide so I can happily compound the over sensitive fairydust snorting crowed into a fine red paste
@edwin  they wont do that. stealing cars  running people over with it and have epic police chases has been the core of the series since the first one. every new rendition just expanded the ways you could go wild. the story of gta is secondary. it would be funny to steal a car  try to hit and run a civilian just to see your car crash against them like you ve run into superman or a streetlamp. at least it would be funny once or twice.
@vain sick  your description brought postal and manhunt to mind.
you could make the case that the old super nintendo game actraiser was a genocide simulator.  you basically play the part of a God  go into a native land and kill all its inhabitants before building your own civilization upon its wreckage...or is my memory bad
@ltnetjak  I wanna be so bad that voldy would be jelaous  d
based
Im just saying  as a boy I like to play zoo tycoon  get my park real popular and busy  then build  so no one can escape  then delete the walls to animal enclosures
@gregory bonnell  classic
while you wait  you should read the books and watch the movies you wont be disappointed
I pre ordered the game on ps5
I grew up reading harry potter   watching the films. I love the franchise. I normally do not pre order games but I would be lying if I didn t say I wasn t tempted.
the original 8 movies were a masterpiece of a series but the new ones are trash.
@ifrosty  just got the deluxe one off steam
@anderclips  I got that one aswell
9 time out of 10 when some one says something is bad. that actually means that its really good lol.
all of those wokies make me want the game even more.even though I watched the 7 harry potter films and starting reading the books.hogwarts legacy is still on my watch list I ll get the deluxe edition for ps4.
ha  I d love if it this backlash from the left ends up leading  to a sizeable increase in new  right-leaning  or just non-extremist types  in general  fans to the series.
I was planning on getting it eventually  but pre ordered it just to add to their numbers and upset the haters
also copium I think is another good one xd
its already flagged as best selling just off preorders
nah  itshould get the  cope   seethe  and  mald  tags
@sentient mustache  seethe is definitely a good one.
done but we need more people to add theirs to bump all the other ones down
believe it or not  this would not stop people from trying the game but itsurely does encourage people to pirate it instead of buying it.
@pacul  the game right now is the best selling game on steam with over 4 weeks before release  the digital deluxe is the best selling preorder on psn right now and the regular digital is the 4th best selling preorder on psn. so yes  people are actually buying this game in mass  and a lot of people reacted to the clown tags by specifically saying they will buy the game. pretty much nobody used the word  pirate .
@darthtrethon  you have no idea huh  you can look at how the game will sell compared other big title later on  how do you think pirated site still up and alive nowadays not to mention the torrent traffic each time new game released  why do you think developer still paying denuvo money despite reducing the game performance  nobody used the word  pirate  my ass lmao
@pacul  you can dislike reality but the sales for this game are abnormally high and its preorders far outpace the preorders for other high profile aaas coming soon jedI survivor  diablo iv  etc. and while Im sure there will be some who pirate the game there wont be an unusually high number of pirates for this. hogwarts legacy will easily be one of the best selling games of the year.
@pacul  its the biggest selling game on playstation right now on amazon. there s millions of harry potter fans all over the world and they re not going to pirate the game just because a vocal minority cant accept a different opinion to their own.
@darthtrethon  lmao cant wait to see how youreact when the game actually release  po number never guarantee the success of a game look at how many failed game in the last decade that have bigger number than hogwart legacy  dont forget this game is coming out from the dev that never actually have a success making aaa game  the only reason people hype about it was because of the ip
@gamermickey1928  wait till the review are coming then we cantalk number  its always the same with game release big po number but when the game fail to deliver most people refund and more decided not to buy  look at anthem  fallout76  andromeda  nms and even cp2077 when release  thanks God some of them managed to save the ip but most just disappear with the po money.
@pacul  that is conjecture and a case of you moving the goalposts. the hate campaign has had zero effect on people buying the game  end of discussion.
I nver read and watch movies as well  but this makes me wanna buy this game even tho I have no setup to play it
@venom  layton  I never read or watch it as well  you think I should read those books even tho Im almost 40
@jack todd  yes  definitely check them out!
I did haha!
I pre ordered the game on xbox with the dark arts skin pack. Im going all in on this  villain protagonist  angle lol
no need to pre-order  but if reviewers say its actually ready and playable definitely buy it in the first week. also  watching the movies  the acting in 1 and 2 is maybe a bit jarring. it gets better from 3rd movie.
@jack todd   I never read or watch it as well  you think I should read those books even tho Im almost 40   no. watch the movies and leave the books alone.Im 33  have read the books more often than I know  have listened to the audiobooks for years while going to bed  easily close to 100 listen throughs   and have watched most of the movies at the very least 10 times up until now.  together with terry pratchett s discworld  harry potter is my go to if Im a bit bored  but dont have the drive to touch something new . the reason why I say no is easy. the books are written for teens and for that  they are great. but the world building is full of inconsistencies  except for the few flshed out adults that are needed for the story  the whole wizarding community seems to be single digit iq people. for the world to be great  you need to do a lot of mental gymnastics and world building yourself. you ll need to ignore some things rowling said and wrote just for the world to make any kind of sense. you ll constantly reevaluate how the world works  because some rather important details may simply be different in the next book  creating a situation where the books before are now nonsensical in their development. too many cheap deus-ex-machina approaches. adults having the mental capacity of toddlers etc. pp.through the glasses of nostalgia and aftr some reworking of the world building it gets fantastic  the story itself is  well  mediocre at best. you ll find characters acting against their character traits to further the plot. and so on. all thatsaid. still good books  but nothing I would recommend for a first time adult reader. have a go at the movies  they aren t worse  but less of a time sink. for now I would say that it looks like hogwarts legacy will be the best entry point for adults  since itseems like you get the fleshed out world  but not the big inconsistencies. if youre in need for good fantasy to read that is satisfactory for adults try the witcher  wheel of time  anything from terry pratchett  oh and r.a. salvatore s legend of drizzt books  the first 22 books are great  book 23 had me leaving the saga though. felt weak and kinda forced to go on.  I d also like to include the kingkiller trilogy by patrick rothfuss and a song of ice and fire by george r. r. martin - buuuuut wait until they finished their last books. both of them have been at the last title of their series for over 10 years now  the wait is.... horrible... . when rothfuss and martin have their series finished  they are an absolute must read  but dont torture yourself with unfinished stories that are good enough to keep you on the fence for the final for over a decade.
@wouter vanr  I still am not over the lupin werewolf look...
@hellequin maskharat  yea thx for answer  thats why I did ask coz I know those were for kids as a main consumer. I did read the witcher first time in 2008 and in 2011 all of the saga ice and fire my fav book ever btw   you dont have to tell me about waiting
a win for everyone! youre going to love the game and the franchise  while putting the haters in place haha
@pacul  what are you talking about  at this point I see nothing from you but petty hopes that the game will somehow fail after launch. you come across as praying that the game will be buggy or broken and cause public backlash because your hate campaign failed.
I would lean toward this being a viral marketing campaign  like when the original voice actress for bayonetta told everyone to boycott bayonetta 3. of course that was viral marketing  and it worked like a charm. if youreally want to know what s going on behind the curtain  always assume intelligence. Imean  politicians have been getting away with criminal behavior for who knows how long  and they get away with it right out in public  because people label politicians as  stupid  and talk as if politicians are incompetent and dont know what they re doing. a good con artist convinces their mark that the mark is more intelligent than the con artist  and thats how the con artist tricks people so easily. so yeah  this is viral marketing.
dark comedy is life!!! lol!
biolithic  Im so glad I saw you here. thank you so much for super chatting my question to chrissie last night. thatsort of thing is very much appreciated in these days of lean income. God bless you  my friend.
@melonie mac go boom  melonie have you ever seen the movie doctor strangelove  its basically the citizen kane of dark comedy.
@melonie mac go boom  I have checked and they dont say genocide simulator on steam.
@r jean gadbois  steam probably removed the tags.
knowing modern  gamers  they might not even do that. just skip or run from every enemy then whine about difficulty when they get starched by something they have to fight.
super mario bros. is a genocide simulator. every brick you crush was once a citizen of the mushroom kingdom. thatshits in gaming s dna.
disco elysium says hellothe rpg with no combat
you cant swear on youtube anymore. anna s going to have a hard time.
youtube is cracking down on cussing in videos now
Im going to steal that now.
@Christopher young  well yes  but melonie was never exactly george carlin to begin with.
I recall melonie s mentioned she doesnt like swearing before. it isn t just youtube.
@mega brick  thats right
I preordered it due to that pic
millennials  I thought it was mostly gen z whipping up this fuss now my generation is acting a fool now  what a disappointment shame on millenials we supposed to be the last line left with a sliver of common sense not stoop down to gen z level.
@naglfar94  nah. as a millennial  I can confidently say that our generation started all of this shit. gen z might be the driving force behind a lot of this stuff nowadays  they are just doing what people in our generation taught them to do and validated them for.
@ichthyodactyl  groomed them  perhaps
@alberic   indoctrinated  is probably a more accurate word but sure.
@naglfar94  to be fair  a lot of middle to late millenials were often mocked because of the childish takes. older millenials tend to be more like gen x in many cases  but all millenials are getting older. they have these things now that they loved from their childhoods and have been fans for decades. and thats coming out in a way to that punk attitude of  I dont care. Im going to buy this game  xd Imissed that.
@ichthyodactyl  this is true. to be fair though  most of gen z are the children of gen xers and some early millenials. millenials dont have a lot of kids either. I think its a case of gen z being so plugged into technology - more so than millenials - but particularly social media and their parents allowed and even encouraged it. its the kids leading the parents at times from what they learn at school and the internet. being  valid  is part of the vocabulary and validation is largely attained through social media while pulling social media characteristics into the real world.but let s be fair. not all. the crazies at twitter  or the ones reeing about a good game  yeah. those xd
@naglfar94  Im gen z  98 baby  and I find this  controversial  over jk rowling hilarious. I cant wait for the game.
@sarn this game is incredibly woke. it being successful is not much of a victory
harry potter was the first novel I read as a kid in 1998  I grew up with harry potter  and I ll introduce my kids to harry potter. dont care about the woke politics.
I totally expect the game is gonna get reviewed bombed on steam and on metacritic by these people the moment it releases.
@thecosmicwarper  but with steam at least they would have to pay for the pleasure of doing so which only looks good on the balance sheet and makes a sequel more likely.
@monkian  but how does refunding work then  I would guess they try to do that afterwards  but with the hype train the game currently has I would imagine the entire store will crash before the haters even get to post a review.
@bok48  2hrs no questions asked   more than 2hrs only in very rare circumstances.  if they did refund the game it would state this on the review along with play time.  also steam has a policy of hiding any reviews they do not deem are about the game as default   there is an option to turn on all in your settings.  this is part of their antI review bombing practices and would certainly scoop up the re-re s bemoaning about the author ip.
Ive long since stopped pre-ordering  this uproar got me to pre-order the game.
@liam warner  I never pre order games either  but oh I am so tempted
@ynghwrwd  for the trans character
probably loooool
the developers already bent the knee to the mob and removed  gender  from the character creator.
my character s pronouns are badass wizard.
my pronouns will be wizard wizardself.check f in mate.
gigawizard mcchad
orb ponderer.
@haterator  wonderful lol
they ve shown the cc and you do actually.
aren t they racist for thinking jews and goblins look alike ! !
@smash er  yeah that  s true  what the hell wrong with people they can be openly racist and no one saying a thing about it thatsucks society s intelligence is dropping even more.
its an old stereotype. jewish people  at a certain point in history  weren t allowed to do certain jobs and all they really had were things related to banking and jewelry. this is also why many jewish names are related to those things.while not all jewish people have large noses  there are many that do.these things lead to over exaggerated art of jewish men  hording gold and jewels and having exaggerated features  such as their noses  which leads to a goblin-like appearance.people seeing goblins as jews are basically just perpetuating the stereotype and are  in a way  being racist.just like orcs being black people because their primitive.... its utter nonsense and actually very racist to even suggest it.
@james bee  exactly. I have never once looked at a goblin and thought to myself that its a jew. I have never once looked at an orc and though thats a black person. if it is a fictional character all I see is a fictional character
@james bee  I know the history of jews in medieval europe. but most jews dont come from the jewish tribes from 2000 years ago  they come from europeans who converted. people from europe have all kinds of noses. not to mention african jews in places like morocco and ethiopia. its not like becoming jewish makes your nose bigger. so the whole nose thing is all propaganda. but even if it wasn t  the average person doesnt see a goblin and get reminded of someone jewish. same with the orcs  not once  literally not once  in the multiple viewings of tlotr trilogys did an orc remind me of black people. the people that go aftermovies and games for shit like that are essentially blaming other people for their own racist thoughts.
@twistedyak  100  agree.
wasn t planning on buying the game at all until I saw all the horrible things they said regarding the goblins and another group. instantly went to steam and pre ordered it to spite them. this stuff reminds me of the lotr stuff with the orcs some time ago.
nothing like seeing the wokie-toastie s hateful efforts bottom out on them
never underestimate gamers. they understand that games are fantasy and pure entertainment  attempt to take that away from them and they will out play you.
if a triple a developer literally named a game villain protagonist  genocide simulator  it would sell millions of copies just on memes alone
villain protagonist is actually kind of accurate  from what I hear you have choices in the game that allow you to be a good or evil character  besides the point though Im sure. thanks for the video melonie!
I really think its great that you openly stand up and sit the haters down! loved your video thank you so much!
I agree with this fully. I am bisexual and male but I go by female pronouns  and also a furry  and yet I got hate by the community that I used to feel safe in with the lgbt community. so I have to be careful to which who Imake friends. luckily I have a select group of friends that I can count on who I trust.
youre absolutely right  melonie! to win the culture war  we cant just resist the woke side  we have to actively fight against it  of course Imean nonviolently . we need to fight the war offensively!  again  with words   our wallets  not violence.
those tags make the game sound even cooler. I love to play as voldemort.
everything you mentioned in the second half of the video really needed to be said! we gotta stick to playing offense from now on! we gotta win this game  heck  this war  because this is very much a war! I laughed my butt off again when I saw your snow white meme. I love dark humor! dark comedy is love  dark comedy is life!
I love how many people are buying this game. even people who dont like harry potter. I love a lot of rothmus tweets. oh I agree with you about sodom and gomorrah goingt on today. you look beautiful melonie. hope youre doing well. have fun today.
well guess what  they started bothering people! thanks for making me laugh melanie.
I bought the adult collector s hp books beside the deluxe edition of hogwarts legacy because of these lunatics. they should work in sales
I heard if you play  hogwarts legacy  after midnight  amber heard appears behind you with a broken vodka bottle.
so glad melonie went on her own.... this channel is the best! she would never have been able to be true about this shiznit before!
actually melonie   some of us are forced to watch your videos.  to test my nerves every 4 hours  they strap me down to a table and force me to watch your videos with a spanish dub while  duran duran    girls on film  song plays so loud my ear drums melt sometimes.it helps to keep us awake... or have a psychotic episode.
twitteratI  hogwarts legacy is a genocide simulator!me  a civilization veteran  new to gaming  eh
exactly. good video. these people are so out of touch with reality. they re liars and hypocrites. they say our community is about being open minded  kind  inclusive and fosters acceptance when in reality they are narrow minded  unkind  hateful and exclusionary. I just talked with someone who called jk rowling a piece of  @  when Imentioned I was excited for the game. ummm.. news flash. calling someone that name is hate speech which your community accuses everyone else of. they re so ridiculous.
love the video! I was laughing so hard! I preordered it and preordered for my friends.
wait until they find out you could start goblin wars in oblivion.
@smash er  this is not exactly true. the group you speak of - the ashkenazI jews - share 50 percent of their dna with western europeans  and fifty percent with their sephardic cousins. this is why they tend to darker features  curlier hair  and yes  bigger noses. not every ashkenazI jew has a big nose  or curly hair  or dark features  and some are far more phenotypically european than others  but most are still distinguishable in some way  through identifiably jewish phenotypical features  ben shapiro is short  has dark hair  and has a nasally voice  seth rogan has curly hair and a big nose  both murray rothbard and ludwig von mises  two of my favorite economists  had  massives noses and were quite short  both milton and david friedman  both economists  have large noses  and david has very curly hair  I wouldn t know about milton  as Ive never seen an image of him with hair   same goes for ben stein  the chick who plays elaine from seinfeld has dark curly hair and a large nose  and the list goes on. as for the fuss about such differences  it is the fact that people think such superficial things matter at all that is the problem. who cares if jews have big noses  from their perspective  we whites certainly have small noses.
aw thank you

who woulda thought risking it all by speaking out about coof poke mandates and starting this channel would have been one of my best decisions ever ! Im having a blast! no more censoring myself  except a little bit because youtube would ban me
@melonie mac go boom  word.
girls on film is great. dont knock duran duran.
@james bee    but iam am righteous!  I duran duran is baddong and I stand for the opposite of baddong  goodnotbad.
me  a starcraft gosu-wannabe   psh... must see blood
me  a warhammer 40k player  burn the heretics!
villain protagonist  you can play as a dark wizzard. so is true.genocide simulator  if you are a  one man army    you are most likely ending a bunch  of people  so is technically true as well.captalism  you do buy tings to unlock stuff  I think. sounds like a normal game to me.
dang! they made a harry potter hogwarts genocide sim  Imight have to pre-order two more copies of the game so my friends can simulate genocides with me together! that will be fun  3
to be fair depending on how evil you can make your character  villain protag at least probably fits.
love your videos melonie and appreciate your hard work in making them and people need to fight back against this brainwashing
hey melonie I hope your weekend was nice relaxing for you.keep bringing theseinteresting topics out that mostdont cover.I absolutely love your reactions on these topics lol.takecare melonie
Im not a harry potter fan  but seeing their product take off despite the smears and backlash is too funny!
their hate just increases sales!  happens every time.
you cant let the devil get a foot hold  in other words give the devil and inch and he will take the whole damn world.
remember when the only weird thing we had to know about a person was  if they were a furry or not Imiss those days...
Im going to love buying and playing this game even more now.
long story short  the game looks dope. keep fighting the good fight melonie
this is hilarious! yes. these people need to keep it up  so the pre-orders continue to skyrocket!
melonie looking forward to seeing you on mario kart with dan vasc  rippa  lady  rippa and g g soon!
I finally bit the bullet and pre-ordered the deluxe edition. I hope it runs on my steam deck.
hey melonie! always good to start the week with a new video. looking absolutely gorgeous today btw.
you most certainly hit the nail on the head. too many people gave them an inch. the more  power  we let them have  the more they complained about how sh tty this country is. funny how that works... almost as if elevating that crowd makes everybody s lives objectively worse.
the great thing is that the sales for the game are booming right now and you just know that these tweets have had a good part in that
I am on a wait and see approach  but the more this comes up  the more I want to pre order.
melanie doing the Lord s work. keep it up girl.
keep pushing this message  youre on the right path. I listen to a podcast daily called  the jesse kelly show  and he is unbelievably spot on with his assessment of the state of the world and where its going and he s been right for years at this point.  he s also very handsome. anyway  check him out if youre into this kind of stuff and pushing this message. offense. not defense.
they dont even try to hide lmao they re exposing themselves and letting everyone know they re doing shit like this
bowing down to these people is the equivalent of walking into an asylum and letting the patient s rule you
these people are amazing marketers I love how it backfires
we are starting to gain serious ground in creating culture and I cant help but think of those that have sacrificed to help lay ground work in the entertainment industry for us like tim allen  james woods  kevin sorbo  and that girl from full house.
hearing mel describe love making sent me into tod and tod flanders mode   oww! my ears!
I just find this so funny they are trying so hard to be mad about it and its backfiring so hard. its just making it even more popular. I even plan to get this game.
sapphic comes from the greek poet sappho - her poems were about women to the point thatsapphic became a term to describe lesbians. edit  today  of course  it also  includes bisexuals and pansexuals.
soon as I seen the gfx on this game months ago I put it on my wishlist like this looks dope  and I read  the original 4 books as a kid  let s go!
gonna play it now. the negative attention actually made me look into the game and it really looks well made. after the review embargo lifts and I hear honest good reviews  I ll jump right in.
just purchased the delux edition 01 10 2023 at 10 23 am central because of this video and my love of harry potter and j.k. rowling. thank you melonie your awesome ma am. keep doing what your doing.  by the way melonie I love the song at the end of your videos.
what a unique game  Im preordering now!
they rlly trued to make it less appealing but it made itsound ever better they underestimate our interests
at first Imisheard her and thought she said  lara croft is kirby.  that would be a fun game  lol.
youre completely right about the  no kink shaming  thing leading to rampant depravity. and I say that as someone who suffers from a pretty severe addiction to said depraved shit.
no russian  was literally a genocide mission lol and it was one of the most memorable cod moments ever
all those tags pretty much describe stellaris perfectly I d go farther and add fanatic purifier  oppressive megacorps  and becoming a galactic crisis
I was going to buy it anyway but this makes me want to buy it even more
what s good about this game is that I can explore more of hogwarts just not the bad parts
haaa yesss I pre-ordered this they had me at genocide simulator
I didn t even know hogwarts legacy was a thing  I only recalled that mobile game thatstrangles kids unless you pay up   but when some rando twitch streamer told everyone who bought hogwarts legacy to fu  I went and checked it out as nobody tells me what I can or cant spend my money on. looked like a pretty fun open world rpg and I enjoyed the harry potter movies back in the day. so I pre-bought the hogwarts legacy deluxe edition on steam yesterday and cant wait to start playing in february. Im a wizard harry! also hilarious but the  imo ridiculously expensive  physical collector s edition with that plastic book and  floating  wand had apparently sold out within just a few hours of sales going live.

sapphic polyamory means she loves several women at a time. this also describes most cis men.
like how pan used to be just something you cooking with but now it means youre attracted to all genders  this is just a dumb joke I know what does pan in pansexual mean
@papyrus the skele-God  pansexual  bisexual with bonus letters.
@ieatpaste23  see thats always what confused me about bI and pan sexual  like dont they literally describe the same thing
@sailorcybertron  pansexual is just bisexual trying to be special.
@cherrios  took me a long time to realize it wasn t meant to cover all types of sexual attraction including corpses  tree s  a real thing  or animals. when I did find out my response pretty much was  so they re bisexual then
imagine being so thirsty that your name is related to sexual orientation
@liam warner  ha! listening to them explain it is an example in stupid.  being bI you like men and women. being pan you like all genders.  then as you say   so  bisexual then
that would make a sapphic dinosaur a  licalotopus
@sailorcybertron  pan means youre bisexual and weigh over 259lbs
@matt atkinson  cis... Jesus wept
is there any fan art of the two character merged together  by any chance  lol
the first step of solving a problem is admitting you have one  so good job and I wish you luck
@nuh-uh bro  thank you  brother.
I cant wait for feb 10!
@vigorellI institute  same brotha
its gonna be an amazing game  I cant wait  to play
great speech at the end you cant be the nice guy forever when these people wont shut up... we have to play it their way  at least a little bit
I pre-ordered it.  in fact  I pre-ordered the deluxe edition.  funny part is that the game was not on my radar until they pitched their fit.
this is all so true  woke has become more and more synonymous with being intolerance and bigotry. we have been patient  understanding and accepting  but this has not been reciprocated. they want dominance not acceptance.
the insanity knows no limits with these people
-  plays stellaris-  makes a genocidal empire thatstrives for galactic domination-  see s a game thats about the world from a favorite setting-  see s tags on it about genocide sim and being a villainthis is where the fun begins   d
last year I caught someone who made a short video claiming that hogwarts legacy doesnt allow you to choose whether your character is male or female  claiming the game has been corrupted by woke people  and I pointed out to them that the option to be male or female is in the character customization labeled as  wizard  and  witch   and the person who claimed to be against political influence on games doesnt thank me for spotting something he she overlooked  instead I get bashed and told that men can be witches too  and I reminded him her that if the difference between witches and wizards are so blurry  why did hagrid tell harry that he is a wizard  it lead me to believe that his her true goal was to get people to hate hogwarts legacy. in short  I unintentionally exposed a hogwarts legacy hater pretending to be anti-woke.
I play games to escape reality.  I hate it when someone drags the real world into my make-believe world!!!!!
Imust say  the new tag does make the game look more fun... it almost feel like we are going to become a dark Lord in hogwarts legacy....
what a weird civil war we are in.
victory!!!!! let s go my fellow harry potter fans
well done video. very well explained as well.
I cant wait to play this game!
steam removed the false tags already lol  not even the rest of the popular tags section has these anymore   looking at it now is  magic  fantasy  adventure  open world  rpg. going from  genocide simulator  to  family friendly  in its popular tags lmao
rimworld taught me all I know to know about the heartlessness of gamers
when I see one of these boycott or hate campaigns it just makes me want to check it out.
did the tag system really become a status bar
I remember finding out you could buy npcs property  in fable  if they died. I slaughtered everyone and bought their homes and shops then collected rent money from the new npcs that moved in. in real life I hate hurting ppl.
vids were recommended from a friend  and now youre in my recommended like a disease! luckily  as fans of 40k and warhammer will know  Im a big fan of disease.  pglad to have found a new creator to watch. and thanks for covering this whole hogwarts legacy debacle  its been one entertaining dumpster fire after another  lol.also  the moment your videos started popping up on my recommended I thought zepla had a secret  american sister she never told anyone about.   shout out to zepla fans.  d
subscribed! this was a funny vid to watch with my coffee this morning. but side note.. im glad I found your channel the woke of the world hurting the world im glad I found a voice of reason .
thats kinda risky  though.this started because there are genuine  harsh bigots out there in the world. then woke people had to escalate to fight them. if we keep it escalating  its all just going to get worse.
@mega brick  thats a fair point. there are definetly awful people on both sides.
its a culture war. let s pray there isn t a fast food war.  demolition man reference
battle of earth this time with eldritch madness l.
kinda went on a tangent in the second half there lol. as someone with weird kinks  I will say that a lot of my friends who share them are all good people. but everyone is different and some people out there are a little  too  weird sometimes.
I dont like to do anything out of spite...but this is one of the few things I ll purchase out of spite.
Im not a harry potter fan at all  only saw first 3 movies  then dropped  but the amount of screeching from activists have gotten me to preorder hogwarts legacy on ps5 earlier today.Im rooting for the games success  especially after that woman was fired recently at limited run games simply because an activist was butthurt over them being excited for the game. these people are crazy.
when you vacate a spot  be it physically or idealistically  you must do so with full knowledge thatsomething else will take your place and that you wont get to control what that is.
genocide simulator  . . . whewww! that broke me  . another spectacular video  melonie. this was great!
there actually is a game that villain protagonist and genocide simulator can somewhat describe  called hatred. though it may have been removed from steam. however  I was demented enough to buy it back when it was available. essentially a mass shooting simulator  twin stick shooter.
it really does drive me up the wall how quickly these crybullies dont see their own hypocrisy. they whine and cry and beg and then turn around and bully everyone into silence while actively trying to destroy their lives for wrong think.
I had no intention of buying this game but after hearing this Im pretty sure once I get off work today I ll purchase it
I legit wonder if this isn t how they advertise to gamers now lol.
awww crap  now Im gonna have to pre-order the deluxe edition
this game sounds awesome  get an extra copy for memorabilia
I got my girlfriend watching your videos. had to explain  corn . worth every second
if thats what they feel about goblins then I d love to see them react to goblin slayer
I guarantee the devs are going to over compensate for the hate and this game is gonna be woke af
the goblins look like jews . Im still giggling
Im convinced marketing teams are in on this  hate clicks is free advertising.
youre doing good work.
those were cool tags Imight actually buy this game after all
I finally looked at the media from this game because of your videos on it melonie. I think Imight actually get this game. I could care less what the muppets spout about stuff. most of the time itsounds like the matt damon from team america.  matt damon
I recently came to the same conclusion. I used to be of the mindset  live and let live  and  to each their own  etc. not anymore. look what it has lead to. society is a disaster. degenerates everywhere.
its genius if its true
there s another youtuber I watch called ssm and he always refers to today s world as sodem and gamora 2.0
those tags have me sold  pre-ordering tonight!!!
steam has since fixed the tags.this is definitely gonna be a day one purchase for me.
yep  pretty much a free marketing campaign that is creating tons of positive interest in the game.
Ive never wanted a game more! thanks weirdos
wait.  people actually look at  tags  when buying games    worse yet  they let these  tags  influence their decision    when did this start happening mel  cute as always.
I bought a pc copy  a ps copy  and xbox copy. all deluxe. before this I was considering picking it up on a steam sale 5 to 6 months from now.
now I know what tags to search for if I want a good game lol.
in all reality goblins do look like them but that makes me want to play the game.  ye24
I truly cannot imagine what s going on inside the heads of these haters... dont know if it makes me sad or mad that there are so many idiots out there
the killing curse is a thing. I think villain protagonist and genocide simulator is so accurate that its a big part of why people want this game.
I hope youre doing well  melonie. also its funny how those people think goblins represent semitic people.
lol  these woke loosers end up making j.k.rowling richer . btw love your hair mel
I am not a harry potter fan at all  but I am going to add this game to my steam backlog on day one.
cool! cant wait to get the game!
I read that tweet too  and even worse  some of the answers in there. wonder what they take. I hate the  the devs got already paid  shit. the devs and everyone else there will probably want to have a job after the release..
villain protagonist  Goddamnit  now I have to do a run as megamind.
its funny that they are so laser focused on trying to tank the game that they cant see past their own activism. because they are legitimately driving more sales by being so aggressive about this whole situation. they cant see that they have distracted the whole narrative from the moral implications of rowling. to people buying the game with no other reason than to tick them off more. and if they had just backed off even a little bit  all of these extra sales wouldn t be happening.
as a jew I am all for playing this game as a goblin genocide simulator
wow I always wanted to play a videogame where I can be purely evil and cause genocide!!! Im definetly getting the game now!!!  3
my jewish self and my jewish wife will be doing the same
well  Imean... a certain retiring niaid director does share a striking similarity with a goblin.
need a  haters gonna hate  tag.
villain protagonist  actually might be accurate depending on the levels of role play the developers allow. hopefully they let go full tom riddle
heh just checked the steam page and none of those tags are anywhere on the list. their tag based protest sure went far.
dont buy that  its offensive for many political reasons     buy that. they focused on actually making a good game movie this time.
when I saw those tags  I just thought  ha  funny!  because these types of tag  to me are troll tags you only see on obscure games on steam that have nothing to do with the tags.I once saw a game about building tracks for a wooden train  or something like that  that had tags like  cold war  and  prostitution .like  wtf
dark times lie ahead of us and there will be a time when we must choose between what is easy and what is right.  -
we re all villain protagonists.
that basically describes all simulation games if we assume the  villain protagonist  is an angry player xd
a genocide simulator where you play as the bad guy in a magical school  I ll take 3
shoot look at the implosion of g4tv as well  if the majority agreed with frosk they would still be on the air
those tags sounds like my kind of game we get to play wizard hitler
I d buy the whole stock now if I could.
as a gamer those tags sounds like a highlight
Im a big fan of harry potter  have been since the first book came out. I wasn t going to get the game  but may have to now! lol
never give up! never surrender!
eren pre-ordered this game
genocide stimulator  I definitely gotta preorder this game
its seems like the karens got tired of hating on store employees and demanding to see the managers  and instead moved up to bigger fish and even formed an army because they know they dont stand a chance by themselves xd lol
haven t they learned that in the world of video games  bad press is good press
when sony vegas pro has the hentaI tag and the vergil dlc for dmc5 has the sexual content tag  you know steam tags dont mean anything much anyways  super easy to troll the system
rofl!!!!!!
loved the video  this hate on the game made me order it thanks for all that do
I was not interested in this game at all  but now I am  lol!
imagine calling  capitalism  a bad tag.
just preordered the deluxe edition. gotta get that genocide simulator 72 hours early.
harry potter is the only person who ever survived the killing curse  and he survived because his mom  lily  sacrificed herself to save him. that means she is the only person in the history of the world who ever sacrificed themself to save a loved one. even her husband  james  did not sacrifice himself to save her  or she would have survived the curse.
I would ve totally bought it already if I wasn t broke lol
I see a game with those tags I would give it a try!
those tags make itsound like a civilization game.
they are pretty racist comparing jews to goblins maybe they are the problem
the cherry on top would be if j.k. rowling making a tweet thanking people for buying the game and making her money
as far as I was aware  dont kink shame  was a meme response years ago. no idea that people were actually using this seriously.
I dont know anything but harry potter but this is hilarious
cant wait to play this
please make them stop  there s only so many times I can buy that game.
shame and bullying needs to come back before everything goes to the devil
started funny   kinda sounded like a call to war at the end. I like it.
tasty woke tears  would be an excellent tag
doom sounds like itshould have those tags
ohh boy they have no idea how gamers think villain protagonist and genocide simulator is like finding water in the middle of a desert
this was a hilarious video...made me subscribe!
Imean it has flaws but right now there aren t great alternatives marx is interesting but not very effective
I d argue the goblins look like leftists.
villain protagonist   capitalism   genocide simulator  as a gamer hell yeah let me try a game like that out. I can go all dark side on the game and have some fun. frist time seeing one of your videos  think I will stick around and see a little more of what you got going on for you. stay safe and keep up the videos.
Im buying this game. the fact that itsays a massive  fuck you  to genuine oxygen thieves makes itso much better
the mass tagging fails its purpose  and serves to make the game even more interesting. this ll be good.
I wont pre order hogwarts lagacy  I will watch the reviews after the game comes out. I hope you all enjoy the game!
villain protagonists and a genocide sim  just sounds like a good ww2 game.
my grandparent s generation had insane asylums to keep the streets safe.  yet another reason they were known as the greatest generation.
Imean  the unforgivables are confirmed options so  villain protagonist  isn t even necessarily inaccurate.
I hope valve starts punishing real review bombers and false taggings
even though I enjoyed the movies  and my 9 year old daughter bought me an awesome hogwarts castle toy for Christmas about 20 years ago  I have never really cared about getting any harry potter games. that being said  the more people try to dis this game  the more I want to buy it just because.  dp.s. I just saw it was on my daughter s wishlist on steam  so I bought the deluxe edition for her.  d
I absolutely have to get this game before I wasn t but now oh yeah I got to get it! but it is a shame Imean my last characters and games was sith daedric worshiper an orc warLord  elf drow and a vampire assassin and a black paladin dedicated to chaos death and torture.
awesome video as always!
Im actually almost as interested in hogwarts legacy  as resident evil 4 remake now
I ll play this game as an hp fan  and even play it in my slytherin robe lol
I just want to fight with silly spells and bamboozle enemies.
I guess they fixed it  because those tags are not there anymore. so in other words  they just wasted their time
I preordered it and when I learn the dark arts I will be all those things! muahahaha!
Ive checked the tags for the game in steam each time someone makes a video for it. I dont see anything unusual. I guess someone is cleaning them up regularly.
based of the thumbnail  if their calling hogwarts legacy is a genocide simulator then wth is grand theft auto
I am a big fan of the harry potter series watched all of them like thousand times except didn t read the books am not a bookworm.  but already pre-ordered the game an cant wait for it
just add a nose ring and blue hair and yup lol!
the haters are just going to put bad reviews everywhere they can so you ll have to play the game and give your own review. it ll be difficult to see which review is genuine
please do some research on insane asylums  I understand these people need mental health help but asylums we re straight up a humanitarian crisis.
I still dont know why they hate jk rowling so much or wanna boycott this game. aside from being insane.
new harry potter movies!  I would bring them back as adults!
when you get right down to it  some of my favorite games are genocide simulators...
lol you had my interest  but now you have my attention- deluxe preorder on point
play a bad guy who attempts to destroy world   sounds good.  will be a fresh take on the always playing the hero bit.
I think I will play this game with the movies in the background  eating chick-fil-a  and looking up the definition of a woman in a 1990 s dictionary.
I was gonna buy it anyway  but now this is giving a new meaning to shut up and take my money. hufflepuffs  let s ride.
when Im dropping guys with the death curse left and right I ll most certainly be a villain protagonist!
villain protagonist   capitalism   genocide simulator  makes itsound like a second sequel to overLord and I would absolutely be down for it
who remembers the games overLord and overLord 2  its a game where you play as a comical sauron-like figure with a horde of goblins at your command.
to be honest ... knowing the gaming conmunity  genocide simulator  would be a vest seller
when I cant go on a killing spree in hogwarts at least fighting prefects I ll be disappointed
villain protagonist might actually encourage more people to buy the game.
damn... Im not even a huge fan of harry potter but now I have to buy it...
already preordered and ready to play
we need that mac boom book written now.
when that butter eating chick on tiktok is one of the most rational voices on youtube  mindblown
damn. valve seems to be rather active trying to erase the controversy on their platform. I would love to read about suspended steam accounts for violation of their rules. please valve. please.the user tags I get shown are  in this order - magic- fantasy- adventure- open world- singleplayer- rpg- character customization- exploration- action-adventure- story rich- third person- action rpg- atmospheric- action- combat- choices matter- puzzle- family friendly- great soundtrack- darkseems to me that the hatemob is losing at all fronts. Imean  even on twitter there s backlash  which I would have never thought possible at all .addendum  some thoughts. isn t it ironic that everything the hatemob touches goes up into flames  when they produce something  they manage to ruins ips that were close to impossible to fuck up  but here we are  Lord of the rings  wheel of time  the witcher  marvel. when they are against something  they manage to make it one of the biggest hits  even before release.companies that produce something they re against should seriously think about hiring them into their marketing campaign and have them run wild. would also be maxd out inclusive behaviour at its best. a double-whammy so to say   d
it looks like there is change itseems. 4-5 years ago  people wouldn t be going against the narrative but noe Im seeing it more and more. there was that massive backlash to wotc ogl change which pissed people off the the lrg debacle. people are fed up with these people trying to control everything  from our food to our entertainment even down to our words. it in time like this that I reminded of a scene from c c involving seth and cain. seth mentions power shifts quickly in the brotherhood and after cain kills seth  cain says power shifts more quickly then some people think.
hahahahaha it is nice to see you laugh again.
those games were so awesome... minions talking about sheepies
cant wait til this game sells like hotcakes
the sad thing is that haters are going to go online and give it bad reviews which makes the game look bad and probably wont win game of the year too
love your work
those people forgot that gamers  favorite video game mission of all times is literally the  no russian  mission   where you have to mow down an entire airport with a saw if you think adding  genocide simulator  in a game s description will stop gamers from buying said game . youre making a grave mistake
we need the  leave brittney alooone!!!  guy to do the same for j.k.r.
keep amplifying the truth
those tags are now  sadly  gone.
it d actually be great if the developers make a game that fit those tags after releasing howards legacy  just play into it.let s get them to make a genocide capitalistic simulator with a villain protagonist!
can we expect a stream from you  Im still unsure about the game.
said it better than I could at the end there mel
I was just going to buy the game for ps5 but just because of this I went and bought it for steam as well. I dont even own a pc that can handle the game..
fun fact eastern european steam page dont have any of this tags!
if they really wanted to hurt pre-sales they should have tagged it with blt  diverse and inclusive.
so  this game lets me run around as the joker with the power to warp space and time sign me up.
Im buying this game and there s nothing they can do about it
genocide simluator . . . I am intrigued.also sapphic relates to love between women so Im guessing she s saying she s a lesbian interested in dating
that tag makes itsound so much f     cooler
I ll make my char as woke as possible  then stream myself getting killed over and over by goblins. just for a good laugh.
cant wait to tear it up!!
I got to quote mr burns.  too late for flattery.
thank you so much!
the haters will even more get mad because the fact that this game is  1 most wishlisted on steam make it top 4 selling games on steam 5 weeks before launch and tons of pre-orders on consoles too  hogwarts legacy will have massive top selling game in 2023
I think you ve misinterpreted felicita s tweet.  not clear  though  but I think she s having fun with bad tags.
Im not even a hp fan and got a copy to rub in the faces of those people.
I dont care about harry potter at all  never read books  never saw movies  the most hp I saw was oneyng leviosaaaaaaa..... but thanks to this amazing hype campaign this game goto on my radar. not enough to buy  but I will add to whishslitso maybe one day when it goes on sale thanks for everyone for bringing awareness!
kink-shaming is my kink.
bless you  melonie!
its hilarious because rowling is literally not even involved in the game at all. she created the ip they used  thats it. people wanna boycott a game that has a very small  distant connection to her.. because she said things on twitter they didn t like. mind boggling.edit  hold up  they tagged it as genocide simulator   why is that even a thing you can do wtffff-
I suspect that much of twitter hasn t realized what cartoons they ve become. the idea that a normie would think a harry potter game was a  genocide simulator  is farcical.
the  goblins look like jews  thing reminds me of when people said tolkien s orcs were coded african americans. then youremember the  meat s back on the menu  scene and its like wow  they have a really flattering view of those people huh
missionary romantic style....    when you chose words so yt doesnt get mad at you and ban your video. hahaha  job well done. dont forget your water.
I cant wait for this game...
I love how lara croft randomly pops up in your vidz!
darn it! here I was thinking I was buying a game about genocide and being a villain but its just a game about being a mage! sigh... since I already bought it  Imight as well play it. lmfao
wow  thatsounds better than it could possibly be.
thats just making me want to buy it more lolol
0 2 in the gaming world for the woke the last few days lets see if they can make it 3! I have faith... gg on an awesome hair day
I subscribed just because of this video dont stop keep sharing
I actually bought the game specifically because it bugs all the worst people.
famous quote   the pendulum goes one way and always goes the other  - maybe a famous person definitely a yu-gi-oh protagonist
now im gonna buy it even harder
its almost reflexive. how melonie sneezes   laracroft! ... oh  excuse me. that came out of nowhere.
their tags and their outright hatred of it is actually propelling its sales.
love your content
genocide simulator had me rolling xd
I play paradox games so the tags of  villain protagonist  capitalism  genocide simulator  are all reasons to play.
hilarious how people actually take dont kink shaming fr when ever I hear that I say  my kink is kink shaming so now what  lmao
I saw the trailer for hl. its pretty impressive. Im not into political stuff  so if the game looks good  ill buy it and have fun with no politics just good ol fun. I think I ll buy the the game for ps4. ps5 prices are so high here haven t actually bought a ps5 yet. so Im glad this game will still be on ps4.
I literally bought the digital deluxe version
society s  much of western society s  depravity including the acceptance of 304 culture has led many guys  especially those with the means and employment  to get their passports and leave the country in search for love in other lands not totally marred by western society. its also why I starting to see more tiktok and instagram videos of modern women pondering why the guys they want prefer what they called the plain jane girls versus  pretty  girls like them.
wait  we can play the villain in hogwarts legacy. finally  my time has come I can be the next voldemort
you look like belatrix lestrange with your hair like that. you should definetely dress up as her and stream this game.
this game looks fucking incredible. its the first time  ever in video game history I want to be the bad guy. I want to be slitherin. it looks fun.
some big time mary whitehouse energy going on here
I play a game called rimworld and most times my colony ends up being organ harvesters and man we are the bad guy. tbh a game where is play as the villain is cool like how carrion you play as the monster we need more of these
bruh  any game with  genocide simulator  is a 10 10 thats what games are all about xd
I shall be pre ordering the deluxe edition
its hilarious thatshe thinks that  villian protagonist  isn t a selling point. she s obviously never played a dark side sith warrior in swtor.
they are always anime avatars  or similar . that tells me they are just the same neckbeard basement trolls we have been dealing with since the dawn of the internet. only difference is now they have had a shave and put on their mums dress and high heels.
wasn t too sure about buying this until I found out this is a ginaside simulator  d
kill all the goblins  sound wholesome
well said mel.
I think  technically  you d be the first voldemort  timeline-wise.
or the mass effect trilogy as a renegade  andromeda doesnt count . man  Imiss old bioware.
I hope this game blows the sales out of the water
guess we should call in the goblin slayer
I decided in 2023 I would be very very picky with my gaming dollars since the economy is on verge of collapse  and this game is one of the few that made the cut to be a must buy.  it pissing off wokesters is icing on the cake.
couldn t agree more!
I dont know about anyone else but after doom 1 and 2ternal as well as utrakill ids say  genocide simulator  is a sign of quality
none of these tags exist on steam uk for hogwarts legacy
villain protagonist isn t bad. I ll be playing both as a good protagonist and then as an evil protagonist after.
genocide simulator  finally some stellaris spin-off! but Im wondering  why they decided to go with spiritualist ethic  Imean... I would rather play as fanatic purifier.
I will love to support this game
Im not really a fan of harry potter like that  but my little sister is.  so Im going to buy it for her.
watched for the cute girl... subscribed for the wise woman.
if we say the game likes genocide then gamers will join us cause they love good things! remember .. no russian
the more the woke try to stop us from buying this game  the more I want to buy it.
this is why we need to bring bullying back to school
the only people who are going to be  influenced  by tags on a digital game are people who dont buy digital games
they removed all the tags
a game could be titled  genocide simulator  and gamers would enjoy it
amen. lets go! great video
wait a second  missionary has been cancelled!  oh damn! I need to rethink a few things when it comes to bedroom olympics.
sapphic  means  lesbian sappho was a lady poet in ancient greece who wrote passion poems about the ladies of the island of lesbosorigin of both the words  sapphic  and  lesbian
thank you so much!
@melonie mac go boom  thank you for having the courage to state the obvious.
sadly yes
now thats bullshit
you can add your own tags to any game... people   shit... as ole travis tritt said here s a quarter call someone who care s.  I know its about a relationship but can be applied to many situations. ! have a great day!
little do you know I love genocide simulators
this is the best selling game since elden ring just off the pre orders alone.... love free marketing
I dont even like harry potter but I just pre-ordered two copies for me   my girl
I wait for a good test review on gamestar or pc games before considering buying the game. I am a gamer and if the game isn t good I will not buy it. and I am really not sure whether they secretly play the game  lol.
went to the steam page to find these keywords and looks like they vanished lolz
games are an escape  a fantasy. that means doing stuff I wouldn t be doing in real life. let me just have fun again!amazon is sold out of the ps5 deluxe edition now btw.
I pre ordered this as soon I saw it come on steam  I have been waiting for this game for too long so I aint going back  just hope it wont end up being a cyberglitch 2077. guesse ill say feb 7-8  because of the 72 hour ea . grew up whitsome ps 1 harry potter games and I enjoyed them back int he day where horrible controls were a normal thing  so seeing a non lazy harry potter game is amazing to me  you know unlike goblet of fire whit the lazy minigame-esque design  except gameboy advance that one was ok . I even remember playing the first 2 on the gameboy color whit the rpg turn based elements to it  it was my cousins games .
there is an old video game called  overLord  by triumph studios that was evil.
if they had stayed quiet lots of people wouldn t have even had this game on their radar. for every 1 person who is like  im not gonna buy this!  theres 10 who are like  wtf a harry potter game! wow!  and will buy it now. as they say  no such thing as bad press.
well misery loves company so they have to try and make the rest of us miserable.
villain protagonist  capitalism and genocide simulator  sounds like my type of game.
haha  yesterday I pre-ordered the deluxe ediition.hey wokies you cant tell me what to buy or not.
cant shame me  Ive seen your twitter timeline
usually I dont care about games like this  but damn this is starting to sound interesting. Imight buy it just to find out what is in it that gets those woke people so triggered.
Im pre-ordering next week lmfao
you ask me to give up  to sheathe my sword by neither force nor reason to accordthe wills of others to my righteous causefor none of us are bound by moral laws.no  for I have a sense of right and wrong and  in the service of this sense  Im strongthose errors which  within myself  I hateI will not in my fellows tolerate.for  even if Im wrong  I ll take that risk my stance composed  point sharp  advancement brisk for  if Im right  I will have done my partregardless if it mattered from the start.with God  without  I love and live to fightmy only right  defending what is right.   r.g.
genocide simulator lmao. I bought my cousin ultimate epic battle simulator a few years back. never thought I would find enjoyment watching chuck norris completely destroy a pack of santa clauses.
already preordered my super deluxe mega awesome edition
the more the wokies cry the more I want this game.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
its like they re begging us to buy it at this point lol. they haven t heard of the streisand effect lol.
ah yes  because everyone looks at the tags for a steam game before purchasing and not do a little bit of research into if the gameplay actually looks fun or not.
I dont know a damned thing about harry potter  only saw 1 of the movies  not even sure which  never read any of the books  nothing against it  just not my kinda thing  but I have to say this game looks pretty good  and the more people seem to hate it the more I am convinced Im gonna purchase it.
genocide simulator   clicks preorder
I probably will play it on gamepass but Im looking forward to it because this game looks beautiful and I really dont understand those imbeciles who try to boycott it
now im buying the game lol
I have to choose between this game and food... wish I could afford both because I d play it until my xbox goes up in flames
this game is gonna sell super hard. just let these twitter loneys do their thing...man  cant wait for the waypoint kotaku polygon hit pieces coming out at launch. first it was the church when the books came out now its twitter-leftsphere
if the trolls keep this up  they ll be selling hogwarts legacy at every planned parenthood. pregnancy termination will become their  3 most prominent service after whatever  2 is.
also  these people seem to confuse the purpose of the tags. they are meant to describe what is held within the game  not what the people who play said games endorse in real life. sorry to burst the bubble of anyone who was trapped within that delusion.
I was super excited about the genocide simulator aswell.
isn t that old xbox original game overLord  where you play as a knock off sauron running a dark army to take over the world  basically just a villain protagonist and genocide sim  people loved that game
umm. are we sure we even kill anyone in this game outside of the forbidden spells area
yes yes well done wokeists well done wokeists however
cult of the lamb... fantastic game
just finished my pre-order.
im not a harry potter fan. the game looks cool  but still is harry potter. but now with that new villain protagonist and genocide simulator  it makes woke up my interest. to see if there is more behind. xd
this girl is adorable.
it looks interesting but I cant pay 60 bucks just to find out if its any good
reminds me of those days when Christians would just buy up all the copies of harry potter books or goosebumps books take them home and burn them in the backyard when they didn t understand that they were still putting money in the publishers pocket by buying the copies instead of stealing them
I got to meet the social media marketer for that game recently and hear him talk about his brilliant marketing campaign for it
looks like steam has nuked a lot of tags that are being added.
for pure humor  you should read off some of the steam curator reviews of the game.  no drinks necessary to have a good laugh from them.
ngl  I would buy a game that has the tags  villain protagonist  capitalism   and  genocide simulator  in a heartbeat so I guess its mission failed for these guys loledit   I have never heard of anyone shaming hetero relationships  though   also  why would anyone care how you engage in  naughty times   it really isn t anyone s business.
Im glad I left twitter  but damn this shit funny
I only watched like one or 2 of the harry potters. never liked daniel radcliff as a actor and it just turned me off to watching it. but this game looks phenomenal and like it could be a really good one. and I probably will end up buying it down the line when I have money.
just checked  those popular tags didn t last long lol...
pretty sure false tagging a game like that is also a bannable offence on steam.
they ve obviously never heard of populous or simcity  the real point of which were to build a strong civilization and then destroy it in a fit of pique.
as soon as  I saw  genocide simulator  I pre ordered 3 copies
villain protagonist and genocide simulator basically describes warhammer 40k
remember fable  you could be a noble hero or a cartoon villain. it made it more fun. and didnt turn you into a monster irl.. cause game
okay  while I still have my reservations about it  especially with the  wok.e  stuff they have added  body and dorm stuff   and the fact it has exclusive quests and has content cut like quidditch and more  I have to say the utter outrage by this is making me maybe want to get it  not pre-order though  every person should know not to pre-order by now.as for  harm  stuff  Im trans and I still like h.p
regarding kink shaming. what goes on between 2 consenting adults or more than 2 I guess in their own bedroom is their own business. I agree with that 100 . so stop trying to make it my business is the only point I would like to make. I can let you do it without having to hear about it and without having to agree with it
basically  tags for stellaris.
overLord 1 and 2  dungeon keeper series  have a big fanbase for a reason  dungeon keeper even has bunch of games  that copy it.
I bought 3 copies to support jk rowling.
genocide simulator  oh you mean warhammer 40k yeah thatshit is awesome
I haven t bought it yet  but will be  either switch or ps5. Im leaning ps5. thoughts from anyone would help my decision.
I want to see a collaboration with ellyinvideoland.
thanks for the uplifting video   I want to know what happened to the good Bible verses at the end  got to feed the sheep!
genocide simulator  isn t that just the sims.
I was never a fan of harry potter too basic to me . people seem to think that when I wear my glasses  that I look like a 6 4 version of him.
I wonder how they d react if this game gets a 2023 game of the year nomination  or God forbid  actually wins goty. it would be the greatest troll on planet earth lmfao
what if kink-shaming is my kink
I had no interest in this game  have never watched a harry potter film the whole way through.  Imight have to pick it up now. ps5 sounds like a good place.
eric cartman has entered the chat  cartman  go on...
amen
a genocide simulator where I get to be a villain protagonist and enjoy the benefits of capitolism  Im buying a ps5 copy and a switch copy. they are selling this game better than the actual marketing team.
there you are playing your online world war iI shooter  and all of a sudden  youre a nazi.  - that infamous extra credits video
thats kind of hard to do and turn the other cheek.  I too am worried the pendulum could swing too far the other way.  that is how we got to where we are right now.  their moderates could not tamp down on their extremists.  but it is very possible they are the same extremists.  they switch to whatever side that best destabilizes our civilization.
villain protagonist  genocide and capitalism  rimworld has entered the chat.
the lengths people will go to these days to project their own thinking and political or personal point of view onto something like a game never seems to surprise me anymore.I guess they dont have a life so feel some need to make a life on hating what others enjoy!Ive heard it being said  although only a rumour  which I dont go much on  that there might be a future reboot and  or tv show  series based on harry potter.while it might be an interesting idea for a tv show  its possible that it could also be a bad movie because as we have seen with many of them  they tend to go with the woke agenda which not only ruins shows but also the name and fans they may have grown over the years.they could of course add things that were missed from the books in the movies but I think a reboot of the movies themselves would be a bad move!
Imean...I would love gen0cide simulator! you could play as different dictators with different methods of purging the undesirables! oh man! this sounds poggeriffic!!
saphic polyamory  - I used to play in a jug band!
people just need to follow the money. this game is doing great. moral of the story  go woke   go broke.
and this is what lead to steam to remove thatsystem...
they really shouldn t be bragging about this. Im pretty sure that false tagging can get you permabanned from steam.
the irony is that they are showing just how out of reality they truly have become that claiming all these things in a  game   media meant to allow you to do things you can not do in real life  because they dont live in reality it must be the game exists in the same reality they do  I bet if youremoved the option to choose a caucasian character and removed the consequences for your actions in the choice based narrative of the game they would be praising the game and calling the goblins white people provided of course that each dev individually publicly came out to say they hated jkr and banished her to hell because  inclusion
waitso if there is a tag for it...does that imply there are genocide simulating games
villain protagonist  as if thats a reason to hate a game  I love playing as villains
turn the other cheek is not seeking revenge  it doesnt mean be a doormat like many like to interpret it. Jesus literally chased dudes out of the temple with a whip  and God led the israelites into battle. nowhere does the Bible tell us to be a bunch of pansies.
love your videos
im still buying it. this is an experience ive wanted since I was 8yrs old in the late 90s. im not letting a bunch of twitter clowns and snowflakes ruin this for me. they can f ck right off. the only people these boycotters hurt are the hardworking developers who put their heart and soul into this amazing experience for us. they are all pathetic.I have the collectors edition pre ordered for my ps4 pro and couldn t be any happier.do I agree with jkr on some things  no. but im still forever thankful to her for helping to make my childhood as magical as it was with this wonderful timeless series.
the more the left gets mad at this game the more I want to play it.
you ever heard of the streisand effect  I think this really applies here.
ok so if the game is antI woke Imay buy it at full price
y all remember the cod airport level
the fact you can make a trans wizard or witch and they re still attacking the game instead of jk is insanely dumb.
I love that the people who call individuals who dont enjoy their woke garbage haters  are full on hating on this game because of the creator of the ip  lol
yupp  just got a copy my self. dont realy play hp games but the more they hate it  the better itsounds.
genuine question for anyone  how many people outside twitter and reddit have any clue about the controversy with jk rowling  I feel like this just isn t a thing most people care or know about. people just wanna play a fun game. people like harry potter. simple as.
I hope you are doing great
I have been playing stellaris for years as a robotic determined exterminator  genociding entire galaxies. am I a joke to these people
Imean come one how many people that had the old zoo tycoon and roller coaster tycoon games didn t purposefully set up their parks as literal hell on earth to the game characters lol. you could feed the guests to the animals for heaven s sake. this is not a new thing so why would they think that kind of simulator or a villain protagonist would really deter us
dang Im taking that Christian redneck  gamer troll pretty serious cause I resemble all those statements....
in the interest of free speech thatshould be ok your a very beautiful lady and it would be nice to say to people without the fear of woke trash going crazy and calling sex assault
preordered 2 copies
villain protagonist  capitalism  and genocide simulator  so  its just every bethesda rpg ever if it doesnt have this stuff in the game  it will soon have it  thanks to mod makers!
jk rowling probably got paid quite a while ago for this game to be developed  all this negativity to the game is not going to make any difference to her. ps5 deluxe physical version is selling out in the uk
them   genocide simulator!!!! me   oooooh  so its like the civilization games. cool!!
its funny that exactly those kinda people who say  dont kinkshame tolerate everything  are also the same ones shaming a certain fet where the man gets off on his wife getting it on with others. yeah  sure - out of all the actual weird stuff  thats the one youre gonna shame and use as a slur  alphabetters   but its fine when we do it   right
they shouldn t even be mad at anyone for having another opinion anyways.
Im not going to lie. I didn t care for hp until all the negative attention got my interest now. .
dont kink shame  and admissibility of literally anything to  get tha bag  are two things that have always baffled and disgusted me. people I thought had values  like my own parents  have done a complete 180 from childhood and now just dont have values at all. it hurts me deeply to see what society has wrought upon my family through the disgusting permisivness of perversion
power to whoever feels negatively about the game  but I cant take anyone seriously if they aren t going to use existing systems correctly. intentionally using the wrong tags on a game is just immature and unprofessional  they re only harming their efforts.
the most popular games out there are  genocide simulators.  these people that complain about this one probably love those games too.
I love handing my money to thatsaltmine now sum of the best money I have ever spent
I dont think the way to handle these peoples criticisms is to outright deny they exist  we can agree that jk rowling created a system of racism in which she used to portray her bigoted views on our reality  I can acknowledge that but it isn t gonna stop me from playing this game  the radical side of the argument is stupid but not all the criticisms are unfounded
the moronic idea that putting bad tags into a game like hogwarts is going to impact the sales at all...  this isn t the type of game people stumble across while browsing steam.  this is the type of game people launch steam with the intent to purchase it.  its kind of a popular ip.
villain protagonist  like kain
ngl  Im not a harry potter fan  Ive seen one movie when I was a kid and I couldn t tell you much about it. thatsaid  when ppl like this ree this hard over a game it only makes me want to play it just on the off chance it pisses them off. they are doing better marketing then the game s publisher.
these are civ tags
I ll probably buy that game and Im not even a huge fan of potter
Ive been keeping tabs on the gamefaqs contingent of these woke clowns and they re seriously trying to outdo one another with their virtue signaling over this game. my favorite was when the resident basement dweller with a karma level created exclusively for him due to him having absolute no life outside of that website showed up and started accusing other wokesters of not being good allies to the rainbow mob since they were saying they were going to buy the game used or watch somebody else stream it online. absolutely bonkers how much this game is driving them mad  just sayin .
Im gonna name my wizard adolf.
the funny thing is that those who are trying to boycott the game and calling the goblins jews  sound more like those germans in wwii. they hate everything that is funny and educational.
great video! people are sick of mentally ill
I literally only bought this because of all the hate towards it.
this game is likely going to have woke stuff in it to appease this very crowd  that wont play it anyway. this game seems to have the inverse of the  controversy  far cry 5 had.
these guys missed prototype
these people sure do love their projection.being called a bigot or racist now a days doesnt mean jack squat to normal people.  in fact I wear it as a badge of honor knowing I am still a normal person who canthink for myself.itsimply doesnt mean what it once meant.  thanks to the very people who are the definition of what it use to mean when it held weight.yet still that doesnt stop people from firing you from your job and trying to ruin your life over these matters.   true clown world.  as you can never reach the peak of clown world.
who is this melonie  she s absolutely gorgeous and tatted!
God bless everyone. traditionalist populism will rise.
meh. peeps just need to know how to ignore the hate machine. its always been there and will never go away. Imean we got karens to thank for summer vacation in public schools  prohibition  witch hunts. and if you think Im just talking about women  you d be wrong  I ll call a guy a karen.
people wont play a game thats basically a genocide simulator. gamers   remember  no russian.
honestly  if they wanted to make people hate the game  use lgbt  tag  female protagonist  anime  sexual content and nsfw. what would have been 100  more effective at keeping people from buying it  cause...lgbt typically makes people dislike it unfairly out the gate  same with female portag  and if you put anime nsfw people will think it was actually just a hentaI game  and avoid it cause  they wont want that on their  main profile .  and parents wouldn t let their kids touch it!  lol. I guess though if trans-people wanted to slander the game  they d do so without weaponizing the lgbt community as a  do not enter  sign  when typically  they want to promote it as an  all  are welcome  sign  with a notably large asterisk. so maybe that wasn t on the table and this was more of a  commentary  on the game  then a genuine attempt to tank it.regardless  I dont promote slander or unjust rate bombing and the like.  I dont dislike lgbt anything. I accept any and all people who hold no hate in their heart  and want to do good while keeping an open mind. I don  typically say  I support he lgbt  simply because  Ive seen a lot of  reflected  hate from that community  basically  its okay to hate a bigot  kind of thinking. which I disagree with. never accept a bigot  but tolerate them  tell them how to be better  and walk the freak away. you can accept them once they change. hating them  however  makes you a bigot of bigots. so..I just dont ascribe myself to such nonsense.  I support equality and respect  always  and forever.and sapphic refers to relationships involving only women or people who identify as women. but  this is just my take on what would have been a better slander campaign  hope it doesnt give anybody ideas.regardless  this video ended up being...really boring and very slanted in the most...unself-aware way.eh  it was my first video from this youtuber  and I ll just  pass next time. no shade on this youtuber  keep doing what you love to do  Im just passing through. good luck  enjoy  and keep on chugging my friend. peace.
I dont even like harry potter  never read a book or seen a movie. all the hype has me wanting to buy the game just out of spite.
villain protagonist and genocide simulator  dont make a game bad. why that makes this particular game bad  is that the narrative of the game  and somewhat the movies books  that the actions of the protagonist is good justified  both from an in-game and real life moral narrative. even pretending that money gold hoarding  banker goblin isn t at all related to a antisemitic stereotype  which is in fact a real racist trope that has existed since before wwiI nazis . the point of the game  based on previews game articles  is to stop a goblin uprising to ensure the hierarchy of wizard human supremacy. which is in fact  form of genocide. now  again we can have games media with villain protagonist doing evil  without it being bigoted media. but  if it promoting the ideology in some manner  the we can be highly critical of said media and the underlying principles.  which Im not even saying thatshe s being directly antisemitic with this game  while I do think she could have done better with the not recreating the stereotype  and maybe not intentionally including the star of david in gringotts bank in the movies . it could be considered an unfortunate offensive accident  and that has very little to do with the media now. so even removing all of that  the goblins in the harry potter universe are shown to be smart humanoid people  with their own culture and magic ability. completely on par with humans wizards  but are not allowed to refine their magic due to wizard laws to ensure wizard supremacy. and then the game s supposed objective is to ensure this supremacy by subjugating an entire race. which from what I understand  is kinda you know  a bad. to make final point  let s pretend that there was a series where the protagonist is irl culturally seen as the good guy. and for the most part he is the good guy. but in one new popular game  the good guy upholds the status quo  which just happens to be nazism  or the kkk  or racist cops during the civil rights movement. then maybe you have to wonder if the good guy was all that of hero to begin with.  and yes  I know the game doesnt feature literally harry potter  its an analogy you idiot also yeah  jk rowling is a huge massive transphobe  and you shouldn t support her. like obviously the game is bad  but being made by queen of terf island  who has been regularly associating herself with further and further far-right people organizations  is also a really good reason not to give support this game and give her more money. Imean  I know youre probably transphobic too. Im not sure why youtube suggested this video to me. nothing is wrong with drag  being queer  being poly  or being kinky.  side note  literally no one has anything bad to say about the term  tomboy . thats such a straw man . why are you picking on some random less then 1k vtuber  Ive technically got more followers then that  and I dont post shit
did they change the tags in the steam comments   because right now they have normal tags like open world  magic  fantasy and rpg tags  or I could be that they cencored those tags in stean in our country
genocide simulator  lmfao! I just call that rollercoaster tycoon. come on...didn t everyone build death coasters named things like  express elevator to hell  and  dont ride this. you will die  more than play the actual game
Im buying hogwards legacy   my wallet  my choice
this game was already going to be woke considering the development team even went to the head of several lgbt organizations to have  good  representation yet it wasnt enough. nothing is wnough for the insane yet companies still bend over and spread their asscheeks for these people.
hmm I think this means Imust buy it now roflol. if it looks like something I like why not.
God some people  but just to touch on something towards the end. so many people hating on heterosexuality to the point that  if youre not gay youre not worth their time   instead of rising about the hate of the 70s-90s where people hated gay people they ve chosen to throw hate back. but Ive had this game pre-ordered for ages  but it makes me laugh that these people s attempt to make people not buy the game backfired.
I am sick of this wokery its going to start getting met with some extreme reactions
I 100  agree !!! your will shame a virgin  but praise wap and say its female liberation
Im not a fan of committing genocide in games. its not an idea I want to entertain. but I know thats not actually in the game  itstill seems like it could be fun  and I want to get it in part to give the woke lunatics the middle finger. they dont determine reality they dont get to demand things of the rest of us. besides  their boos mean nothing. we ve seen what makes them cheer.
oh man  these people would hate overLord  war for the overworld  dungeon keeper 1   2.....
are there any games  movies or tv shows anymore where the protagonist isn t a villain  rinks of powder  the witcher  willow  ring a bell this is the result of the popularity of the  anti-hero  which arose in the 60s and 70s.no  I want to play games where the protagonist is not a villain.and I have no problem with  genocide simulator ... we ve eliminated countless pests that threatened us in our ascent. I would have no problem whatsoever  genociding  the orcs of middle earth into non-existence.
genocide! Im in!
these are fictional characters  in a fictional world  with fictional scenarios. nothing about it has anything to do with reality. people play games to enjoy the unrealistic parts. let s say someone s work of art ideas writtings was  messed with to a point it is being used as some propaganda or just poopedit  so far from its original design that it is now a decepticon.... that is not just disrespectful  but ..... haven t hate groups start wars that way  this world might be doomed lol
man these people shouldnt play stellaris  you can be an opressive regime bent on galactic genocide
postal comes to mind  another game that trying to boycott didnt work out for.
boy  they re getting really really desperate aren t they. its funny how if they would ve just kept their mouth shut  this game probably wouldn t be  1 on the ps5 and steam  and probably others yet to come  best seller of 2023 list. I have a feeling that even if this game doesnt turn out to be the game fans were hoping for  its still gonna be a success and most likely gonna get a sequel thanks to the woke mob going full dumbass on twitter. and if it does get a sequel  the woke mob will help sale that one too with their meltdowns on twitter. it will sell twice as much if hogwarts legacy exceeds expectations.
genocide simulator  they re basically forcing me to pre-order it at this point.
1 00 I understand correctly that we will play for voldemort exterminating mudbloods. never been a harry potter fan but this sounds like a great game.
I have no interest in this game and just purchased it on steam. this game could be the death of the plague known as the  modern audience  myth and thus its well worth supporting.
do you know many ones and zeroes were slaughtered in the name of gaming!
its interesting that everyone accidentally fell into noticed that pronouns is a tell. people dont exactly understand why  but its inherently abusive and the claim of why is false  thus no-one  even full self-id should promote such exploitative manipulation. -- not that anyone needs to change their agreement  but itsure would be nice if people understood that and furthermore that appeasement is a manipulation tactic  or fallacy if you look at it in a certain way.  just a little more  of some use  than just feminists fighting each other and for the old market-status-quo.
they couldn t have asked for a better marketing campaign and it was completely free
not the first. mass effect or any 4x game allows you to choose genocidal actions....sappho was a semI famous ancient greek poet  who also happened to be a lesbian. so if something is called sapphic  it refers to women who like women .
saphic polyamory   a woman who sleeps with a lots of women  you can say thatshe doesnt always want to graze in the same pasture
the haters in this day and age the worst and the best cause they are basically doing a mass promotion for the game lmfao
maybe the pendulum will swing to other side  and eventually we will have to tone it done  a little  I dont know  we will see well maybe it would be better to do something that will not swing the pendulum to opposite extremes  otherwise  it is just hypocritical whataboutism  while doing the same acts of forcing own policies onto people.
rimworld  hugefarts legacy pog
a vtuber  huh  they re overwhelmingly hard lefties  and the more I see of it  the more I d rather watch pippa ranting instead.
I never was a fan of harry potter. but Im going to play the game since the woketards are making such a big deal about it. lol. plus it looks like a solid game anyway.
why do we have to demonise everything no a days. what do these people even do for fun.
villain protagonist  genocide sim  capitalism   this a secret dlc for doom eternal   lmao.  careful whoever buys this game...the purple tinkler is gonna get ya!  may not be today  but it may take them a few years from now.  they ll dig up your tweets from when you were in middle school and get you fired from your job when youre 60 years old.  pepperidge farm remembers!
someone with tepes as their twitter name adding geno simulator tag to a game.  surely a plant to rile up the re-re s
the  goblins as jews  thing is as old as fantasy. people were saying that the dwarves in the hobbit were supposed to represent jews.its just a lazy attack by people projecting their prejudice on honest people.
capitalism... one of the greatest forces for good in the history of mankind.
I pre-ordered just to spite them
genocide simulator isn t entirely inaccurate. a good story is going to have incredibly terrible themes to it  though. would we still be talking so much about wwiI if hitler didnt try to eradicate jewish people
two days later those tags are removed
do you want some cheese with that whine of yours if anything being an evil protagonist with little to no limitations will make the game more fun.as it is  in one of my play-throughs I hope to become as  moste evil  as big v himself  jumping up and down in a childish tantrum on steroids  cackling like bella in a high-pitched childish voice and handing out crucios and avada s like candy on halloween.bring it on!!!as for capitalism.... I d love to take over the goblin bank and control the wizarding worlds economy.bring it on x 2!!!
Imean most people Ive heard from are just angry about everything jk stands for re her dislike of any trans rights  especially considering she puts a not insignificant amount of her personal wealth towards that goal!
jk rowling  jk   first her books were burned by fundamentalists saying they promoted sorcery and now the other extreme likely burns her in effigy too  comin at ya from both  sides
why is capitalism a  bad tag  my parents and grandparents were communism survivors  and I would choose capitalism any day over socialism.
I still live by the mantra of  live and let live .but  that  let live  is important. I dont care what you do in your house on your own time. if you start slamming into my face  we re no longer speaking the same language so I too have to start speaking a different language so that we re on the same page again.
I d prefer a game with capitalism as a tag rather than a game with communism as a tag.
ooooo can I call my wizard adolph
time for some woke tears go boom bottles. stay hydrated
I ll take the chance that this isn t some brilliant ad campaign and pre-order it just to hack off the twitter-istas.
I think I will buy the game.
Im preordering it for the nintendo switch!
I cant wait for the sequel.  hogwarts  hitler on a broom
would be real funny if all those people got their steam community accounts banned  d
I got kicked out of a discord for buying it lol
im gonna wait with this game and see whether its actually good  cd project red burned some bridges with cyberpunkedit. wait am I crazy... im researching the developer  itsays avalanche games. I thought its cd project red... I swear that I read thatsomewhere before
genocide pwns!
the internet is dragging  limitedrungames  on social for what they did to @karalynne0326
what if I told you avalanche studios was approached by far left outside party that demanded money for internet protection. avalanche studios refused and laughed them out of the building. now here we are.  sincerely an avalanche studios security guard.
laughs in plague inc.
polyamorous- involving  having  or characterized by more than one open romantic relationship at a time
hahaha...I see felicita blocked me after replying to my tweet.  thats awesome!
love your perspective  not sarcasm
sapphic is girl on girl love.
its 10 people with a hundred bot accounts each and a lot of time on their hands because they cant function as a normal human being
genocide sim  when goblins are still around and are having a political upswing in harry s own lifetime.
bad tags
you got to check out stellaris  genocide sim  crusader king 3  incest sim
Im dead
the joke s on them. I d check out a game about a villain protagonist.
villain protagnost genocide simulator  ... isn t that basically just one way of playing grand theft auto   oooh  scary.
big it   you mean like that richard levine character
shoot if they add war crimes Im all in lol
Imay steam this game on release
-villain protagonist  -capitalism  -genocide simulator.......rimworld
1 49 this is just them being salty mad and everything else that is not harry potter.  lol
Im going for a goblin slayer build!!!!!goblin slayer season 2023
how is genocide simulator a....oh wait virus inc exists lol
sapphic means lesbian lol or lesbian leaning bisexual woman. Im bImyself but damn there s a reason Im not apart of the community like this.
plague inc is basically a genocide simulator and thats a good time
@melonie mac  sapphic  means  related to love between women   so it is a euphemism for lesbian .
wow  I did not know the wokies dont like the word  tomboy .
wait wtf  why are these  haters  fan baiting the game
I have a shame kink. checkmate!
and the steam sells are exploding
dont you ever go hollow.
tweeting corn    scratches head
I thought they were vampires  not goblins
harry potter and the goblins of mordor
I blame myself. if we had only bullied the freaks in school more vehemently then we wouldn t be here. Im sorry that we failed in keeping them in check.
if a genocide game existed it would sell a lot.
the first one is right because the game is going to let u be really evil if u want to but that is not a bad thing u dont have to play like that if u dont want to
my God.  they really want this to fail  dont they   Imay get this just to piss off some blue hairs now.
I dont play a lick of video games. Im about to buy 3 copies now
I never pre-order games. been burned too many times. however  Imade an exception for this game  just to spite these haters.
I want too get the game but the way companies put out shit half done broken buggy and so overly monitized these day s I dont do preorders anymore.
what a lovely day.
how canthat person be both a she and a they  as she they put in her their bio. man thats exhausting to say haha. but anyway they is a plural  oh I get it  she was talking about her split personalities cause we know most of them have mental health issues. I finally get the  they  pronoun
I saw his her their it twitch channel and its a dead one with 277 followers. maybe she he they it make that tweet to promote his her their it channel. and yes he she they it is a trans vtuber.
it would be a tragedy if this game comes out and its trash but dont be surprised if it is the people who are making it have no experience in making really good games but I hope its amazing
Im buying 2 lol
but wasn t the villain in harry potter after genocide so how are they attacking it
alot karens doing that  just buy it! nox!
most video games are genocide sims lol
I need to wait till it comes out for xbox one  but Im totally getting it. Im 42 nobody is going to tell me what video games I can play.
genocide simulator  count me in!
t s geno-cide  not gen-ocide.
they cant separate the art from artist
those tags sound based. I am buying 6 million copies
makes no sense thatsteam allows you to tag a game without having played it.
I will be playing this game on february 7 because I got the deluxe edition and if any woke lefty comes into my stream trying to shut me down I will ban them
sapphic is just a bougie way of saying lesbian.
yo they are desperate to do that
Imight be wrong but cant you get banned for abusing steams tags
I am looking forward to hogwarts legacy  fight me nerds lmao.
cant play hogwarts legacytoo much ultrakillsend help
satanic panic  but make it woke.
well  many played postal 2
I wasn t going to buy a second copy but now because I have extra funds. I will be buying a copy for my xbox series x and playstation. dont like it  good  I was hoping for that.
lol jk rowling is living rent free in all their heads.I hope she claps back and makes them all cry again
speaking as someone with a big nose goblins look nothing like me. ferengI on the other hand...
but I like the cross in your name and this is coming from a guy whos agnostic
what is the reason of these attack on the game and its makers
wokers are insane ive said that
my favorite game is rimworld and basically is organ harvesting and genocide
I kid you not as a trans person myself I fully disagree with all this firing all this woke shit like dude the minority needs to just stop I just wanna live my life without care like Im buying the game I legit dont care hell I bought it 4 times because of these people I just am so sick of them giving us bad light
I will buy the xbox one version near on release.
tbf  the whole  tiny hats    goblin thing  has been around since the middle ages. short  greedy  long nose  etc...
villain protagonist    mass genocide   these sounds like the tags to an post apocalyptic manga with an op protagonist lmao
the  haters  have no idea how video game promotion works most games have genocide in them gta call of duty  heck even pokemon  how many pokemon have  fainted  from players
ok...strange how different some regions trade this game.... in the english speaking parts  the last   is  genocide simulator in germany its  family friendly  well... I guess there is something wrong with  your  woke people
villain protagonist   capitalism   genocide simulator   lets goooooo!!!!!!
free exposure even if people were not going to buy the game they are going to now out of spite
I wonder where all these people have the time or energy to constantly whine and complain about so much that doesnt affect thier lives. I just dont have that kind of will power to constantly put energy and time into hating someone and trying to stop them from making a living lmao. most these people guarantee live rent free at thier parents house. while j.k rolling lives rent free in thier minds
I was gonna buy it anyways but Im def gonna buy multiple copies now. people need to get off the internet and get outside and touch some grass and get a hobby.
hey melonie if you come by and read this will you mind telling me just ahy I have melonie mac mac all dress in black going through my head....
streisand effect
good answer
the game would sell much more if was genocide simulator hehe
color me intrigued
clearly they haven t played the game rimworld. that one is known as  war crime simulator . lol. oh there is also a term for what is happening  the streisand effect. and you are seeing this in its full glory!
genocide simulator  you mean lemmings    loved that game!
besides capitalism they just described the God of war trilogy.
genocide simulator clearly none of them play arma 3  to understand games just await a game to commit genocide in.
is this hogwarts legacy or attack on titan
melanie mac go kaboom  you just made a mathematical error!!!  twitter established 2 2 5!  I am gonna go now  im getting ready to operate a robot to preform micro heart surgery  and I need to double check my mathematical calculations!
subbed!!!
just seems like they re getting a gd dose of karma !! haha . I already bought it twice. your welcome to your opinions but frankly I dont give a damb.
this is the worst best advertising I have ever seen
here s a counter tag... how about we mass report these accounts
annnnd pre-ordered lol.
these people are insane
maybe Im just too old cause I can not understand why people see real world races in fantasy creatures it makes me think that they are the real racist  I also think they should of picked tags that would discourage people from picking it up cause genocide simulator  would make me think it ll play like doom   harry potter universe with doom gameplay
I pre ordered deluxe edition lol. these people are hilariously sad.
also  as a sexually depraved person  please do not group me with those deg3nerates  d
what s the difference in your regular instagram posts and subscription posts
goblin lives matter.
nothing. people should only sub if they want to support  like leaving a tip essentially. Ive posted a couple memes but that is it  I have a lot of platforms to focus on so right now I dont have much bandwidth for additional content
@melonie mac go boom  thanks for the response. dang  I ll be looking forward to your decision when to provide variety with your quantity. keep it up!
looking like a yummy snack. check that. a full course meal.
I think its only the us version. the eu uk version  still  has normal tags  for the moment  if everything is racI t  if everything is s xist  if everything is h0m0phobic and if everything is transph0bic then nothing is  - me
I should buy the switch version just to make the groomers mad
a vtuber    chuckle.
quick higher them in the advertising department  a person who can generate that much interest is in short supply
rather keep tht vtweeter out of the vtuber community. lol
a certain stereotype does look like goblins though.  look at alan greenspan and ruth bader ginsburg to see the resemblance.
I need a time machine.. I cant stand modern times..
when I play I will throw them at the wall really hard they will kiss my feet yes master
100  psyop.
I loved the first part of your video  but your point for the other half is missing some real examples imo. for example  @9 50  Ive never seen kink shaming loving doing normal stuff  e.g.  like you pointed out  doing missionary lovingly . I get your point  but I feel like you are making broad generalizations...
buying because of the crazies. I dont know any harry potter anything.
this outrage is getting ridiculously old.
wait! anybody can do that! well. steam will most likely take that feature. this will backfire. still  dont pre order.
wait whats a villian protagonist and why is that bad
reminds me of that family guy clip where peter convinces congress to go to war because anyone who doesnt is gay...only these dingbats took itseriously
your eyes
they do have a game were you play a demon it is called disgaea
this whole pitiful boycott is just pointless and pathetic.
omg so true
pronouns confuse the fuck out of me.and the best part is  whenever I ask someone what some pronouns mean I legit do not get an answer to it.edit  my friend after looking into the hl  backlash  he has pre-ordered the game without ever watching any harry potter movies.
sapphic  as to or pertaining to lesbianism   so they only want polyamorous relationships with women.
just purchased this game just out of spite.
bro they are big mad wow
your voice reminds me of vanellope from wreck it ralph so much
genocide simulator eh   d its harry potter  not warfare!
genicide simulator and villain protaganist thats called the overLord franchise fun games  theykilled themself doing the lets copy diablo thing that was going around
I thought lemmings was a genocide simulator...or was that doom

Im  jew and Im happy to be as good in trade as trade goblin
as a jew  yeah  I did feel attacked when I saw the goblins in harry potter. they were obviously charicatures of stereotypes.
boycott doesnt work most of the time bayonetta 3 had tgmhe same backlash but look what happen it failed they never learn
oh man remember state of emergency  and state of emergency 2  that game would be bannnnned to quick!
seriously have they played stellaris
genocide
are you drinking enough water
they hate jk rowling because she described what a women has and is. like people cant get more stupid right
genocide simulator  sounds like the doom games
they said last of us 2 was review bombed when they just made a bad game.this will actually get review bombed from people that wont play it
so  the game s not out  but those lunatics can already tag it  shouldn t steam just delete such nonsense
villain protagonist  and  genocide simulator   sounds like a game based on china or ussr

looked up  sapphic polyam . it means  polyamorous lesbian .yeah ... I got nothin .
that lady didn t actually go back to that company that fired her did she   I d have to them to shove it. I d go look for a new job. and maybe talk to a lawyer
why she sounds like sarah silverman lolol other than tht hogwarts legacy ftw  game looks bomb
boycotters  you disgusting evil killer capitalist I bet the kinda games you make reeeeewarner bros  Im sorry can you say that again I cant hear you over all this money flooding in... maybe a little louder!
to felicita..... my sister in Christ.... touch grass. this is so sad and pathetic
these people have obviously never seen rimworld  aka warcrime simulator .
who s fragile again
meanwhile rimworld players  genocide  thats cute. would you like to visit my baby organ factory
so what youre saying is...vtubers are the problem...got it.
love you
imagine being so sad and pathetic instead of just not playing or buying something you try to force others to not enjoy it. like Im taking my ball and going home. Im glad the majority is standing up to the twitter trolls.
anyone against mass genocide has never played a lemmings game.
some of these taggers sound like children if they re legit.
mI bigote es m s grande que sus cerebrotes.  got deluxe edition even when regional prices aren t being lenient with this one
haters putting more attention on the game  thus increasing sales. nice work haters.
live and let live except if it involves sexy women fictional or real life unless we say so.
yooooo I want a genocide simulator!!
I would never buy the game anyways   just not the type of game I would even want to play
no she didn t that I am aware of  they just disabled comments and are getting roasted to oblivion at the moment lol
the weirdos that reeeee dont spend money on games anyway. im still going to wait a bit before buying
did they even think for like a.. microsecond those tags are all selling points  lolhow slow on the uptake are these people hahah  d   -  hah wowbuncha nolifers  all of them.gaming is supposed to be fun  but they wanna have it be...what exactly
go antI woke make bank. not exactly as rolling off the tongue is go woke go broke but just as true !
I didn t plan to play the game  but since the nazis decided to boycott it I think I ll give it a try.
v tuber
yeah this looks like and ad campaign using the isms to promote it.
wokes also attacked dungeons and dragons saying orcs are black people.
honestly if the  normal  people agaisnt gameing woke movies woke government woke we can destroy the wokeness
h8rs gon h8
you know  I was originally going to skip this game  since harry potter is not my cup of tea. I would buy it now just to spite these people
tbh  genocide simulator  seems based and fun.
the goblins look like j3ws!   yeah  I guess they shouldn t state the obvious.

grabs can of monsteryeah  kz-simulatoropens cannow that was a genocide simulatorthey dont make those games anymoreand about saphic-polyamory saphicism  is basically just another  older  word for lesbianismit more or less means the sameboth terms originate from saphos of lesbosteacher of an all female school on the greek island of lesbostechnically she was bI  but she appearently had a very  close  relationship with her students
so they re proudly acting like that one specific group from the 1940s now.
so let me get this straight  I see a goblin and they see  money grubbing big nose jews ...and Im the racist riiiiight.
not a fan of potter. but I pre-ordered. because I am a fan of lefty intersectional wokey salt.
funny when there s multiple games out there with protagonists that aren t necessarily good people Imean look at gta its literally a psychopath s wet dream and the characters aren t good guys and people love it  say what you will but this woke era really is getting out of hand
hahahaha
black people are orcs and jews are goblins  - the good guys
not sure why this is in my recommended but this chick is cute and Im a simp.  alright see ya
hImelonie
the goblins are like jews.jews   wtf.
play as a villain    g     d  simulator    sign me up    houseofslytherin yedolf
oh not! not... capitalism!!!!
I for one am looking forward to putting down a jewi-... goblin rebellion this february. gonna be cozy. hail h-...hogwarts  d
I like ur hair
what  I cant t play a genocide simulator  filled with dissapointment.
villain protagonist  capitalism  genocide simulator  they must be playing call of duty zombies as richtofen.
lol  they be tagging capitalism like its a bad thing.
this persecution complex of yours is perverse.
these the same people that destroyed star wars  marvel mcu  the last of us and other properties. and yet still wanna take down my boy harry potter damn.
waitso they think capitalism is bad they think orcs are black and goblins are jewish these people need help they re selling the game so well
I am buying a few copies for pc xbox and playstation.  when woke people hate something it means it has to be a good game or movie.
people who spend their days complaining on twitter aren t very bright   who knew
genocide simulator lol.
its just a damn video game... these people are so silly lol...
if the woke left hates it Im all in buying it now
wow
Im not buying it for the opposite reasons  the dev added sexs outside of  make  and  female  in character creation
without using google  I think sapphic is a fancy word for lesbians.
literally defines herself as sheep  you just cant make the stuff up anymore lol the government owns these peoples thoughts
the people sticking these tags in dont game. they dont know gaming culture. they dont know why games appeal to people. they stick these tags in like they never heard of the sims or all the swimming pools full of dead people and houses built for the soul purpose of burning down with all the exits removed!
j k rowling stated the obvious. as far as goblin bankers... well stereotypes dont come from thin air and I thought this was understood. the left just noticed
hogwarts legacy is a best seller nehehe  voldemort laugh  --- got called a racist and bigot  so I replied back cancel me yes please haha
well that game sounds very exciting with all those tags. people need to lighten up  and stop being butt hurt about everything  also learn to take jokes.
had no interest in this game until genocide was mentioned. much like I had no interest in playing skyrim until my friend said he accidentally became a cannibal. sign me up.
based.
um  j.k. rowling didn t have anything to do with this game being made. at every possible step  these people display their idiocy and their ridiculousness.
good!  as soon as I get home Im ordering my series x deluxe version.also  the people comparing the goblins to jews are the same ones who compare orcs to blacks  ie the real racist.
is an adult with several thousand dollars worth of video games in their steam account   I hate capitalism!
when did  capitalism  become a bad tag... also the new hogwarts game sounds spicey  sign me up.
I disagree mel we re out numbered by woke people.
well when I saw that goblins look like jews it really made me buy the game.
ok  I ll put down halo for 5min and preorder
the Godless nazis calling others nazis while fantasizing g simulation. makes sense.
hI im new here
I play stellaris as an ultra xenophobic authoritarian power genociding aliens. genocide simulators are fun.
honestly   genocide simulator  sounds pretty dope. can we choose between blue-haired and pink haired weirdos
the fact people can even do that on steam is dumb.
hI  thank you for stopping by!
your welcome
based on footage from the character creator it looks like you can make purple hair
they complain about hate raids and review bombing and then they go around hate raiding and review bombing.hypocrites being hypocrites. nothing surprising here....
I hate harry potter but im gonna buy just to troll woke activists and rub it in there face. love it
but the goblins do look like jews. not only that  but they act like them too.
if we had to hate stuff based on whether someone connected with it did or said something that wasn t considered appropriate at any given time in history... everything would off the table.these bored people need to do some research on the music they listen to  the clothes they wear  the shows and movies they watch and most importantly  the religion they choose to follow.these bunch of hypocrites that think their shit doesnt stink.
capitalism is a bad tag . ... ... ... lol
isn t it weird how nobody of a right mind even thought of equating the goblins to jews  but the left in these tweets are  like isn t that the racist way of thinking if literally nobody else thought that the goblins look like jewish stereotypes.
better yet  buy it on steam  and request a refund for not having a genocide simulation  false advertisement... why can regular people affect a store front they dont own
goblins look like jews  ........ wut!  tbh a game when you are the villain of the story  move everything around and just wage war on people to be rich sounds awesome.
you can understand the hate for j.k. rowling because she s transphobic but I will still buy this game doesnt mean Im like her or transphobic its just a fantasy world
this is funny  but I am so against pre-orders. it has really destroyed the industry  among many other things  but pre-order culture is really bad.
haven t people got better things to do than hate on a computer game  if I want to buy a game... I ll buy it. leave me alone lol
this is backfiring hard for the socialists.
comparing harry potter goblins to jewish people is one of the most hilarious racist things Ive heard in so long. I laughed audibly
evil despises good. evil hates holiness. the wokeists hate God  humanity  and reality  I shame evil. I shame evil all the way.
them comparing goblins to jews is fucking crazy.how do they not see what they ve done.
as a jew  Im much more offended by these people comparing jews to the goblins than the movies and books themselves just kind of hinting at itsuper vaguely.
Im buying this game just because it pisses of the left  lets make it goty 2023
shame they got rid of the transphobic tag  would have made it easy to find some awesome games
capitalism is the best tag
I disagree  lara croft was objectified  but no more or less then a lot of male characters.
I cant stand harry potter  and I instantly distrust people who list their wizarding house in their bio....... but I almost want to buy this game just to piss off my opponents for the last decade.
people need to stfu and stop worrying what I am buying with my own money. the hate these game is getting just make me want to play it more lol
the funniest is probably capitalism.....literally every video game is the product of capitalism.....
go woke go broke
if someone think goblins look like jews  I think the problem is not the game  but the person who thinks that way...
r gamingcirclejerk is actively attacking  bullying  and demonizing other queers just for saying they want to play the game. they re also perpetuating the narrative that the game s story is all about antisemetic blood libel and other such nonsense like the main character is a slave owner. they re also attacking the story of harry potter and raging about how there are better magical school stories that exist while recommending works like percy jackson.
I dont like potter but I realy like when anglo-sorosian globalists are angry or show their foolishness.
I bought gta 5 just because feminists said it was misogynistic.  if figured if they hated it  then its probably fun. after all I like porn and strip clubs too.
genocide is too soft  if I cant commit war crimes en masse this game is useless! mass avada kedavra ftw!
a comment for you
the same people who believe goblins from harry potter look like jews  probably believe the orcs from dungeons and dragons look like black people.
warner bros. rolling in the sweet dough. great job leftists. way to  stick it to the man .
the game looks good. I am thinking about getting the game just to spite these losers  that probably never play games. let us face it  these people are just miserable and want to make you miserable. so  let us just make them miserable by buying the game and posting videos about it. lol!
hey melonie  so sapphic is a term relating to lesbianism  but this person also thinks the best thing about women is  penis.  idk must be cool when words have 0 meaning. anyways is this person a content creator the have  vtuber  in their name. also best part of the game is when j.k. rowling flies in on a broom and says  trans women aren t real women  then flies off. happens during the quidditch scene.
I hate goblins
...society s supposed to function a certain way...wokeness is about a functioning society...
lol  take that cross out of your bio for supporting video game genocide!  God straight up called for the genocide of the anakim and the rephaim!  get rid of those nephilim!
capitalism is great  my goal is to be the seond person to dive into a money vault.  capitalism
people triggered by  genocide simulator   clearly have not read the old testament. voldemort cannot hold a candle to Gods temper tantrums.
who needs to spend money on advertising when the woke mob will do a better job of selling the game for you than anything
lol so confusing!
...dis-functioning...
I hate that these morons get associated with left wings politics... Imean Im a lefty and a bit of a tree hugger but I believe in biology and science so I also believe in  man woman  everything in between could aswell be a unicorn. if you feel like a unicorn I dont care but dont push me to call you a unicorn  p
this doesnt make pre ordering games any less moronic.
its a privaladge to disregard other peoples existamce  just to satisfy your  entertainment . Imean its crystal clear... some people have issue with something that you have no inclinition to care. cant you guys see it  the apathy  ... bro its the deffinition of apathy.
also....who doesnt enjoy a little genocide and capitalism!
yeah capitalism is amazing! and if cant tell I am being sarcastic.
born and raised jewish. grew on j.k rolling too. those spiteful clowns are out of reality. going to buy the game on steam out of support to j.k and spite on the wokies.
honestly the woke deserve every l they get. especially after destroying my favorite show trigun by making him a twink and cry and beg for help to be saved by meryl.   the reviews even say  its not what the fans wanted  and it better.  yeah they just ruin everything.
I hope this game does well  just to piss off the woke crowd  but Im not buying it  have no interest in harry potter
capitalism is their  evil  tag  out of all the tags you coulda put forth they went with capitalism  they weren t even trying.  thats lazy as hell.
haterz
why are we defending jk rowling now because she said one obvious thing about the transgender issue  are we gonna forget all the woke garbage she s done to ruin her fandom and books  she created her own monster.
yeah some people saying not buy the game because I say so.  sure pal im just going to enjoy hogwarts legacy while you eat your own hate.
Imean its not like Christians never did a genocide what a strange burn.
if someone has an issue   dont buy it... its a single player game. its not going to affect my experience.
the goblins dont look like jews. jews look like goblins
wouldnt jews be more offended by the fact people are comparing them to goblins
funny how mutch racist a anti-racist can be on twitter.
sapphic means she s a lebian
I genuinely wish it was blatantly bigoted and anti-trans. I d buy 6 copies.
villain protagonist   capitalism   genocide simulator    holy! stfu and take my money! best 70  I ever spend. dream game.
and ironically in the changes they got rid of milly a tall strong female lead.
goblins look like jews......what
oh great  wb... I want to buy the game to spite the twitivists  but Im still mad at wb over ezra miller... a side b side
I say let your freak flag fly  just dont try to make people salute it.
no one gives a damn what they think.these are the same people who cried orcs in d d looked like black people
lmfao  the wokesters tried to shoot this game down only to end up promoting it instead has got to be the most ironic and hilarious thing Ive heard today.  good thing this game is still well  n alive rn  and even more hype thanks to the woke mob. 1.  Im still buying it for the nintendo switch on february 10th. already pre-ordered it. so  yeah... cry more wokesters  2.  wokesters  for sake of humanity. please  get a life...3.  and most importantly  for the love of all that is sane in the world. leave. your. craziness. out. of. video. games! video games is the last place I want to have to deal with ya ll crazy wokeness... in fact  its the only place I go to relieve stress from ya ll crazy wokeness...and since when do people play video games because of the controversial topics being brought up in video games  what happened to just simply playing video games for the sake of fun without having to worry about bringing up political correctness  or whatever controversy that is ruining the experience  also  if you dont like someone else s beliefs. who cares! its their beliefs. just leave it at that and move on with your life. but to discourage people from buying a game for that petty reason is so childish... sigh... society is getting weirder by the day  and more  n more mentally sick if they have so much time to go out of their way to do all this sabotaging... it just makes me wonder  is this what they do with their lives...
capitalism is a bad tag  lol. good luck in life kids.
capitalism  is supposed ot be a bad tag  lol.  only if youre economically illiterate.
lol @ trans
everyone should tag it as antI woke.
they ll never be real women kek
I am vehemently against pre-ordering  but how can I say no to a capitalist genocide simulator  I sold out and bought in.
jewbacca
I hate jk rowling so Im not paying for the game but I will enjoy it  and ion care that much about a game release and he universe writers twitter feed enough to steam bomb it. hoping its actually a  genocide sim  because they said you could make yourself a dark wizard with all the evil curses. so what happens if you were to cast thatshit on the front lawn of hogwarts  would the game even let you
but... but... dont you know if you buy the game  the game will physically hunt down and kill trans people or something!
dont care gonna buy
find it hilarious the same people trying to cancel this game supposedly support the lgbtq community but they re actively trying to cancel a game that literally has a gay professor character and the most trans inclusive character customization in any video game ever. the way these people blind themselves with rage into their own hypocrisy and blatant lack of common sense is truly fuckin incredible.
isn t comparing jews to goblins kinda racist
wait  so is your argument that we should shame people for their sexual preferences then  or are you trying to say that no one should shame anyone for anything  within the law   unclear....
I gotta keep it real with you if you look at goblins and first thing that comes to mind are jews I dont think the developers are the issue here
find it funny af that wokies are triggered about diversity  ethnic minority ect. yet are drawing comparisons between jews and goblins. the irony of how offensive that ridiculous comparison is  is actually hilarious.  Im woke  but let me make offensive comparisons to show I stand by you. cant ever in my life remember any jew ever watch harry potter and say or I guarantee even think that.
Im hoping its almost fnv level of choices mattering and outcomes for different actions
what does  go on the offensive  actually mean  what are you trying to get people to do  also you say that live and let live is not working  what is the alternative to that philosophy
I thought Christians were all about  live and let live  and  do unto others...et cetera.  also  you say people are sexually depraved in actions and attire  a hard line Christian or muslim practitioner might say your own attire is  sexually depraved  I dont think so but some might  where do you draw the line
j.k. rowling is a bit of a bigot and a nutter  not accepting peoples choices in gender identification. she put that out there. not thatshould reflect on the game  the game might be good or it might be bad. I personally cant stand the universe she created and find her writing style very simple and child like.
bunch of weirdos  still gonna play the game.
apparently this person is not familiar with a little thing called no russian.
sapphic   lesbian. sappho was a female poet on the island of lesbos in the ancient world. so sappic polyamoury is basically  slutty lesbian .
capitalism as a negative tag  do they realise normal people understand capitalism works
what about undertale  screw gta5
isn t this shit like  for children
hmm thinking goblins looks like jews  thats pretty racist!
the game just looks boring to me that all look like farcry.
they actually do  and its funny  d
farcy in the 1800s  with magic  does it exist  xd
