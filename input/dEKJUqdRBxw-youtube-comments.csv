well. she did win. she s successfully  progressed  the gaming industry to such a lowpoint  and has strong-armed her way into so many circles of the gaming industry  thatshe s able to get easy rmoney by grifting and doing nothing of value.
her only victory is making game creators as miserable as her. congratulations to her.
she destroyed strong  beautiful   independent female characters and replaced them with bland  dumpy  ugly and uninteresting female characters.   yeah she sure did a lot of good there.
congratulations  anita. female characters are  progressing  to a point where they re barely recognizable as women. pretty soon  games that give us a gender option for a playable character will just offer an androgynous stick figure and then ask us if we have biology degrees first.
anita sarkeesian if  evil can not create only corrupt.  quote were a person.
she s not wrong  the game industry has been giving into the demands of the woke far left and making absolutely unnecessary changes to games to appease people like her. its sad  but what are you gonna do. Im just going to enjoy my old games.
everything woke turns to shit. - donald trumpthis is true especially in video games  a multi-million dollar industry that relies heavily on their game sales.
she s ruined mainstream western games.  we still need to help japan make amazing beautiful female characters.  they constantly show how sexy and awesome go together.  nobody in that fandom looks down on such characters.
male characters are allowed to be over the top while female characters are not. the obvious next move is to eliminate male characters  lol. which is sadly not far removed from what s currently happening.
yes  she destroyed creativity.
all anita did was makes the fans angry and poop out some crappy videos.the games industry was going woke anyway alongside western society as a whole.she gives herself way too much credit  games are woke these days because they re made by woke people.
sarkeesian are the type of people I absolutely despise.back in pso one of my friends was a female I called siv and to be honest  it reminds me of you. I was a hucast and while I would slay really tough monsters by the hundreds  but my unyielding tendencies showed I was anything  but invincible.she was a fonewearl and her techs were powerful she was very easy to drop.however together we were nigh-invincible I really miss her.anita is nothing compared to you  her and even less my girlfriend too.
sadly  she s not wrong. and her idiocy has even infected big japanese companies. its sickening.
she s definitely won in her head. effectively created a branch of the gaming industry and fandom where people are constantly harping about perceived injustice  and demonized the large portion of peeps who just wanted to have fun playing their games. thats what people like anita always do to every piece of media  hobby or fandom they touch. they rivet on the idea of seeding chaos and division  or as they say   subverting expectations   while getting profit out of it.its a damn shame most people let that happen by not pushing back. most gamers are good people  trash talking or not  and the community allowed these weirdos to move in out of good will. after all  why not share something you like with other people  the more the merrier  right  well  hindsight is always 20 20. let that be a lesson for everyone else  gatekeep your hobbies
has she played  well no  thats the thing  she openly admitted to not being a gamer nor interested in video games  she saw the opportunity and took it  she only wanted attention  praise and money. mostly money.
I find it funny thatshe declared victory at a conference where nobody who disagrees with her was allowed to attend and she did not allow it to be recorded.actions speak louder than words.
thank you so much! you are all so amazing and I cannot thank you enough! Im so thankful for this community where I can come to listen and hear such beautiful words and be a part of a positive group that values morals and prayer. this really made my day and my upcoming birthday!
sadly she is right  she introduced toxicity   cancel culture in gaming  played a signifcant role in the forced change of lara croft  jill valentine and the more discrete tweaking of tifa. most disgustingly of all she played a serious role in the tragic suicide of a respawn dev  who was falsely accused by zoey quinn. she made censorship the standard  and to top it all of she managed to get acces   reform the various dev management educational programs of the industry and universities. which is why so many new young devs are activist minded. despite she has been exposed so many times  its mind boggling how much damage she has caused to franchises and studios like naughty dog  blizzard  bioware  or her attempt to extort cdpr. who were luckely smart enough to ignore her and im sure ive forgotten a few things. heck her and her evil cronies managed to speak at the un  not that im a fan of the un but luckely later admitted they shouldnt have listented to her. but it gave her the cloud she needed to talk to  high level politicians. she is a fraud and a sociopath of the highest order.
she never truly won and she never will and the push back towards her movement is growing strong
its ao weird to say you  won  a contest your  opponent  wasn t competing in. people were just making games and she comes in and just starts bashing everything. its more gaslighting  acting like you waged a war against an enemy when in reality its just people minding their own business making games.
its blood money really.
elden ring enters the chat.
sadly yes. we are in the bad timeline.
one might say channels such as this are also grifting and adding nothing of value
@josh cramer  and they would be wrong.
@cosmojames  not really  it just depends which way you lean. all of these channels and people like anita grift to their particular fanbase for money. geeks   gamers is a big one that comes to mind.
@josh cramer  ok  whatever you say dude.
@cosmojames  everyone that disagrees with something is  grifting
@josh cramer  I dont think you know what the word grifting means but what evs people are gonna throw that word around too much until it loses all meaning which half the damage is already done lol im a grifter youre a grifter shes a grifter hes a grifter we re alllllllllll grifters youve entered the grifter zone
just like how news shows  and reality shows have made broadcast tv as miserable  as them.
misery loves company. if she cant be happy and have a good time  no one else can
look at how much of a dumpster fire last of us part 2 or the sequel that never happened if you ask me.
she hasn t won.  feb 27  2021   now  swan says  following current projections  sprm counts are set to reach zero in 2045. women are riding a very sick horse and they want it to run faster so they keep spurring it  but the horse is about to give out. soon the horse will be free and in a better place and the rider will be alone in the wilderness at the mercy of the elements. sleep well my prince.
and that is exacrtly what she means as  won .  that was always her goal.
@mark witt  youre speaking my language now  thats exactly how people feel when every one of these channels puts  woke  in the title
@dave and his death beanie  everyone that is offended or triggered by something they disagree with is labeled as  woke
just like how jerry springer  maury povich  and the kardashians have  muscled  their way into the television landscape.
I was going to write my own reply but  you already said what I was going to say.  I guess she had to justify her womens studies degree some how since tax payers are not going to pay for it.
@josh cramer  youre probably not wrong. upper echelon gamers said it best  everyone with an audience has a demographic to cater to. and  truth  in this day and age is.... whatever the hell you want it to be.
yeah so low that every one runs to japan for there games.
it wasn t anita s doing  though. it was black rock and their esg scores.
@knowbody  black rock is just a pawn on this chess board  you need to look at who s holding their leash.
@justin carloz maxino  I think neil druckman is more deserving of sarkeesian s  studies   then maybe  last of us 2  would ve ended up being good.
well  she got support but not a lot of money. though the corporate went woke  she forgot that they corporate. they pledges they tell every lone for publicity aren t promises that they have to keep. so after a few thousand dollars  they didn t give her anymore money and left them off dry.
@josh cramer  no see sarkisian crowd funded tens of thousands of dollars   almost 100 thousandsm is memory servs  to  make an 8 video series . and made 2 under 10 minute videos. that is grifting as grifting is theft.
@josh cramer  just looked and it was 440 thousand dollars.
@chester lestrange  she has tons of videos in that feminist frequency channel  not just two.
@chester lestrange  her entire ff women vs tropes video series only raised  991  you can see it on all the videos https   www.youtube.com watch v x6p5azp7r_q list pln4ob_5_tteaa_vc8f3fjze62esf9yp61
@josh cramer  reading comprehension needs work there bud. I know her channel has many videos. I said she raised money to do a specific 8 video series on misogyny in video games. and made 2. and walked away with almost half a million dollars.
@chester lestrange  I cant find any source or evidence on that other than memes.
@josh cramer  Ive literally posted an article forbes did on the whole thing. and there are countless others. you are obviously choosing to not look for it in good faith.
@chester lestrange  properly hoping anita would read his comments lmao xd
@robert mcdougall  you may be on to something lol.
sad but true we are fighting a losing war with feminism.
you should see her  war  with a former you tuber called repzion think thats the name . the videos are still there I think to view . and yep itstarted back in 2012
gotta admit though  its fun trolling these weak people. wish it wasn t so easy  I prefer a challenge.
I would consider it as a pyrrhic victory for anita.
yeah  and it all started when females poke their noses in our hobbies.they were never interested in these things of nerds and losers  but it became trendy and brought in lots on money. et voil !  a legion of  girl gamers  appears! and then  we have to make our hobbies for them and only them  as they and only they want games to be.and pals  you know it. unless youre too young to have been there and seen it firsthand.
@josh cramer woke is a convenient euphemism and descriptor  not a political or otherwise nefarious tagline.
@josh cramer  I think you  like far too many people on the internet  abuse and dont understand what the word grift and grifter mean...
@josh cramer  while I think thatsometimes happens  I just think you dont understand what people are talking about by the word  woke.
@urak da brainstompa  this is kind of a chicken or the egg question. does someone say the things they say because they have the audience they have  or do they have the audience they have because they gravitate to what the person is saying  the difference between the two is that the former doesnt actually believe what they re saying  while the latter person is genuine. many people  however  cant tell the difference between genuine sincerity of belief and disingenuous grifting because their ideology makes them incapable of believing that anyone and everyone who believes differently than them can profess those different beliefs honestly. their own beliefs should be so obviously and self-evidently true that everybody who claims otherwise must be insane  lying  grifting or just plain evil  and yes  Im going to make this  partisan   because intersectionalist progressives and socialists are absolutely the ones who do this the most online . this is true for some individuals whose beliefs shift and change based on the trends  but to just automatically assume this of everyone  even people you dont like or agree with  is a very immature and narcissistic point of view.
@haita el pastor  youre misinterpreting the nature of the problem. while it is true that men have always been the majority in these spaces  and while it is true that more women have been drawn to it over the years  the state of things is not a direct consequence of more women engaging with these spaces. youre conflating the  minority  group with the toxic  grievance-mongering activists who claim to advocate in their name. in the specific context of this conversation  youre conflating  women  with  feminists.  the problem is the activist crowd using the real and or imaginary interests of minority demographics for selfish gain against and at the expense of the majority  not the people who never asked for the activist s disingenuous advocacy in the first place. actual gamers  actual geeks in general  whether they re men  women  straight  gay  or from any racial  national  religious  political or ethnic background generally like their prefered hobbies for what they are and always were  and the change they do want is only what would actually enhance what made their hobbies great and desirable in the first place. if someone comes along claiming to like something and saying that they want to be included  only to demand that everything about it be changed to suit their personal whims to the exclusion of everybody else who was there first and might disagree  youre dealing with a willfully subversive activist  not merely new blood entering your hobbies and interests  and it is paramount that you be able to distinguish the difference if you want to counter them and rally others to your side. direct your righteous ire toward the ideologically possessed radical activists where it actually belongs  not toward the groups of people being weaponized for ideological gain.
@tyler w  three quarters of the time  the answer to your chicken or egg question is both. initially  somebody might broadcast their genuine beliefs and opinions on the open airway. that opinion resonates with enough people to gain an audience. with that audience comes notoriety  connections  influence  and potentially profit. now  comes the compulsion for growth. they keep their thumb on the cultural pulse. they apply thatsystem of belief to all the relevant topics. more views  more subscribers  more ad revenue. until they find themselves pigeon holed into being nothing more than their opinion. no room for introspection  or mental spiritual growth. no potential to challenge their own opinions and possibly learn something new. ask any former sjw with a following that dared to ask questions they weren t supposed to. they find their  friends  and  allies  have suddenly stabbed them in the back. their audience leaves. the subscribers and views go down  and so does the ad revenue.  imagine if melanie had a chance encounter that caused her to question the opinions she expresses on this channel. and through that encounter  she decides that the feminists were right after all. if she ever expressed that opinion  what do you think her audience would do in that hypothetical
its simple.  if they woke the game  dont buy it.  if they make the women ugly  or even just plain  dont buy it.   eventually they will get tired of losing money.  thats all they care about.  they dont care about videos  or comments...they care about money.  give them your money  and they will keep doing what they have been doing.
the idea of wokeness being the biggest problem with the games industry is absolutely laughable.
didn t bioware consult with her when developing anthem and from what I have seen the female characters look exactly the same  just like asarI in mass effect andromeda which only peebee  lexI and the asarI reporter are the only ones that look different from the asarI you meet throughout the game. they often dont even have face paint. the strippers were wearing the body glove that the armor pieces are attached to. what kind of strippers wear thatshit  then for last of us 2 didn t they make ellie look like a man
@02091992able  it was abby not ellie who looked like a man  but yes you are correct.  I dont think snarciesian  misspelled on purpose  was involved in the last of us 2 but it is the ripples of her machinations that caused things like that to happen.
you mean characters that look like her
@butters66  yes  but its more then just ugly vs. beautiful its more about a garbage cookie cutter woman character that just acts and looks like a man vs. a beautiful independent fully realized female character.
@butters66  lol you beat me to it.
correction  thatshould be  bland  dumpy  ugly and uninteresting male characters.lara croft now looks more masculine than I do  and I actually own a y chromosome   and she s not alone  pretty much all the  women  we see in aaa games now either look like full grown men  or they look like 12 year old boys. thats the new  feminine  now I guess  a 12 year old boy.feminism won! there are nolonger any female characters... and thats a victory  somehow  uhhmm.. yay  yeah I dont get it either.
she wanted representation
@matthew williams  to be fair  abby s build was never made out to be a good thing. it was meant to show what her revenge obsession had turned her into and how it would destroy everything she cared about. I rather enjoyed the hopeless revenge story despite the shoehorned in wokeness.
@timeofragnarok  maybe  but I have seen many female body builders who can and do still look classical beautiful.  some very few look manly but most are very much obviously women.  abby does not look female 1 iota.  bulking up does not remove all female sexual characteristics.
same thing is happening in most movies and tv-series today...the matriarchy s middle names are  mediocracy  and  average ...sold as  speshjul ...
@matthew williams  sadly she was... druckman said she was an  inspiration
lol every female character is her
@ziggy bean  she does seem to be the template true.
@timeofragnarok  I would of bought that argument  if the last of us games weren t based on grounded in reality body portions... abby is not a realistic character.
@second form paul  it pretty clear isn t not
@grobut81  I think the only female character they over masculinated  was abbey. I dont agree that lara croft looks like a man  she looks like a woman who genuinely works out and that works with what she is expect to do within the game. you wouldn t see a porn star capable of doing what lara does  but I know thats what you want. I actually clicked on this video to agree that feminism shouldn t be invading the game industry  but reading some of your comments  perhaps its a good thing they did.
@matthew williams  while I agree that they made some characters deliberately less aesthetically beautiful for one reason or another  particularly dina compared to her mocap artist and the original character design based on her   and you can probably make an argument that its why the main female characters were not particularly  well endowed   not that there s anything inherently wrong with female characters without great breast-to-hip ratios  but feminists have diminished these qualities in some characters to desexualize them . there are  however  actual story reasons why abby is the way she is. it isn t so much that were trying to make her look like a man as though it were a good thing  because in the context of the story  thats objectively not what they were doing. when she was younger during the flashbacks to the events of the original game and the events prior to the sequel  she looked like a perfectly normal girl. then at the end when she s found to have lost all of that muscle mass  she looks a lot more normal and feminine there as well  albeit a lot more gaunt  sickly and starved under the circumstances in which ellie finds her. she got completely ripped because she was a part of a stable community that enabled her to constantly train her body pretty much every day for half a decade so she could be capable of eventually taking her revenge on joel  the absolute killing machine we obviously know and love  and naturally  the average 18-20 year old girl would need to put on a fair amount of meat on her bones to have any significant likelihood of success at going toe-to-toe with a strong and fully grown man with natural testosterone without likely getting wrecked in the process . abby obsessively training and hyper-focusing her time and energy on pursuing her vendetta which resulted in her abnormal physique was not treated as something to be praised  I dont remember it ever being said or suggested thatshe was taking some kind of steroid  and Imay have missed that implication if it was there  but that wouldn t surprise me if it were true . instead  her muscular and highly toned physique was effectively portrayed as a monument to her own trauma  self-inflicted misery and the relationships she sacrificed and sabotaged because of her toxic behavior and obsessive mentality.
@grobut81  I dont support the feminist agenda to make female characters as frumpy as possible  not that I think there s anything inherently wrong with there being vwry average-looking characters in games and stories in general   but I can only assume you have no idea what youre talking about when it comes to laura croft  because the laura croft in the most recent game trilogy is an absolute knockout. the only thing thats changed is thatshe was given clothes more practical to the situation and not more overtly sexualized  and there s nothing wrong with that. not that I would ever complain about laura being in her skimpier outfits like in the older games on account of me being a red-blooded  musculine young man who likes attractive women  but they were going with something more grounded  and thats perfectly fine too. Im all for calling out destructive  ideologically possessed and deliberately de-beaitifying bs in gaming these days  but its always best to be accurate  fair and even-handed when arguing a point. otherwise  you give everyone who isn t already automatically inclined toward agreeing with you an excuse to dismiss your argument altogether regardless of whether or not youre making a valid point. maybe this is just personal preference  but I dont see how anyone thinks this character model from even the most recent tomb raider game from a few years ago isn t a gorgeous character. maybe this is just personal preference  but I d argue this iteration of laura croft is easily one of the most attractive female characters in gaming.https   i.pinimg.com originals 09 d8 2a 09d82aa04c7f72e54777ed63a2a7691e.jpg
@tyler w  then I can only conclude you are attracted to masculine features.you know what I see when I look at rise shadow laura croft  small eyes  new laura has the small crab eyes of a man. if you look at the 2013 laura  that looked fairly natural  she didn t have big disney eyes or anything  but it looked destictly female. not so in rise and shadow  where she has the ocular proportions of a man.massive square jaw. dear Lord I wish I had a jawline that looked this masculine  but I guess I ll just have to settle for looking like an average dude  I cant be a giga-chad like laura croft. seriously  who though it was a good idea to replace the lower half of her face with a snow plow  when your female character has a manlier jawline than clint eastwood  something s gone very wrong.bullneck  because nothing says  woman  quite like a bullneck. yeah... no thanks...wide shoulder span. dear Lord those are some wide shoulders  as in  laura has wider shoulders than some of the male npc s you ll pass on the street. literally. without hyperbole. I checked.and to make matters worse  every outfitt they give you makes her shoulders look even wider.the body  androgyny  thy name is laura croft. wow this is a hot mess... you have primary masculine traits like a long torso  short legs  a narrow pelvis  wide hands  combined with that massive shoulderspan Imentioned previously  but then you also have some muted female traits springled in  breasts  although they almost look like pecks in some of these outfits they gave her   a subtle hint of hour-glass shaped waistline  and I do mean subtle   and slightly wider thighs than you d typically see on a man. what is this  is it male  is it female  its... neither  both  what in the actual hell am I looking at and dont give me any of that  she s just athletic  bullplop  because that is completely and utterly false. packing on a bit of muscle does not completely alter your skeletal structure  and it is the skeletal structure of new laura that is the problem. its completely wrong  these proportions are not natural. this is not what a woman who goes to the gym looks like. not even remotely.
@tyler w  I both agree and disagree in part with you  while having a deep philosophical argument about abby s character as a whole in every aspect of the game is just a can of worms I d rather not open.  my point was her body even if built as you said  and the game explained  she just wouldn t have been able to get rid of her femininity 100  as the game portrayed her  unless she we taking massive steroids and testosterone  which the games setting wouldn t make that an option to explain away  over a long extended period of time.  look at almost any real life female body builders even those that you could easily argue that they re roided out still retain a semblance of the female form  yes it is severely muted due to muscle growth like breast fat being almost if not totally gone and hip being less filled out  they will still have naturally wider hips  less broad shoulders.  her motivation and reasoning for her actions  while I dont particularly think she is a well written character are within reason.  truth be told she is the ideal woman for the current day woke 3rd wave feminist cult narcissist idealogs a  strong woman  who acts and looks like a man but with a vagina.  they seem to have forgotten that real well written examples of strong heroic woman exist in fiction  amada ripley  samus aran  lara croft both the old and new though I posit the new not being too well written but scenario and setting working greatly to put forth a strong albeit young woman.  among many other examples too numerous to count abby just doesnt reasonable fit the bill in any way or fashion and comes off bland and poorly written.
@tyler w  thanks bud  for saying all the things I dont have the patience to type out.
@robert lutece  at least we have doom
literally
I ll take a screnshot of this
@an bal figueroa pavez  Ive screenshoted at least 5 times
anita  Im sorry  but the videos I promised are in another castle.
not just corrupt  but also make a profit from the wreckage.
thisssss
ps1  and ps2 games are still there after all
I would suggest to find a way to fight back.
@antarescross88  oh absolutely  people need to make their own entertainment weather it be video games  comics  whatever and dont let anyone change your vision.
@antarescross88  time to create stuff
yup and half if not most of those games turned out to be absolute ass.
just old games  nah come to indy and eastern games we got fun here for everyone and boobies too. only buy the aaa games that are worth it like elden ring gives those games journos accessibility demands the middle finger and subverts their ideology with story. i.e. the final boss is a trans allegory that you beat and the best ending gives you a maiden  rannI  as you become the elden Lord.
@nameless shield  exactly bro. I have been working on my own games because I am dissatisfied with what has been releasing.
there are still a few companies out there who haven t though so its not a total loss yet.
@beef jerky  link bro  if I can support you in a way
luckyly aint as bad as in comics so good main stream still gets made
yes. I still play standup games like galaga space invaders defender phoenix etc. woke feminist mental illness ruins everything...
@the jarric  yeah what s up with the comics its so sad
@spartan300  comics are suffiently low budget its relativly easy for indies to compete
unironically quoting trump
it wasn t anita s doing  though. it was black rock and their esg scores.if it was just her  it wouldn t have gotten this bad.
@knowbody  black rock
@otakudaikun  its a deep... deep... deep rabbit hole my friend. I am surprised the gaming fandom isn t more aware of thatstuff.
@throw acnt  yeah  ive no clue what youre talking about sadly.
japan is making the kinds of games they want  and thats awesome. I wish western devs would grow a pair and get back to doing that too.
@otakudaikun  I can definitely see why you d think that. stuff like bamco changing their logo or companies putting out statements about  global standards  but I also think that a lot of japanese have stepped up in fighting for the freedom of artistic expression. as long as they keep that fighting spirit and like minded westerners such as I fight back against it too Im sure we ll still get stories that can be told how the creator wants to tell them. fan of your channel by the way. I really loved that video  women do not own anime women  that was the first video I remember seeing of your channel. you rock  dude.
@dudebro guyman  thank you   nice code vein pfp.
the obvious next move is to eliminate male characters  lol. ironic considering they re trying their hardest to turn women in to men.
Imust have killed some 45b men in games and some 2k women  mostly from mass effect 2. we are already removing them on the daily one way or another.
this is where nintendo will come in. their games are already so childish in style  changing them will only result in billions and billions lost in future revenue. and sega put too much into sonic  and the fandom s toxic members fortunately pushed away people like anita.
@man of truth  what
there is no such thing as western gaming   the gaming industry involves 95  america and 5  british and european companies. wokeism originated in the united states and has been taken in so to speak by some a lot of western european countries which is not good . at the end of the day its the american corporations that are responsible for most gaming .
@spartan300  I dont mind blaming america but there are other parts of the world that are just as ban-happy if not moreso.
I dont know. it takes a lot of creativity to turn a boring bland female character into a profitable game. she has set new creative challenges   some people just want to watch the world burn.
look at it this way bureaucratic challenges and red tape wont stop the booty parade it takes creativity to get around them and guts to build new enterprises outside of their vile influence. bye-bye mainstream hello indies  h-games and eastern games. florida and texas are the future of modern gaming  they are already building platforms for free games on crowdfunding sites like indiegogo.
she  itched about mario to get to her position and who hasn t done that
that is all about to change. its going to be japanese imports and going outside to live life  no other option will be considered.
I think thats more true now  but I still think youre way more likely to find a non-woke aaa video game to play than youre likely to find a non-woke big budget movie blockbuster  for example. not that itshouldn t be opposed wherever it pops up its ugly head  but its not hard to avoid such things and still have plenty of enjoyable games to play. as bad as it can be  I dont think this toxic leftist ideology is even the worst problem plaguing video games these days. that dishonor probably goes to invasive microtransactions the live-service model in multiplayer games and the general refusal to preserve gaming history. the woke rhetoric is everywhere in the mainstream establishment media outlets that cover games and the industry  as well as from the pr side of the industry itself  but  the diehard progressives are the minority. guys like colin moriarty have said this for years  but there are lots of conservatives  libertarians and true  classical liberals in the gaming industry who mostly just keep their heads down like they do everywhere else  something people need to do less kf because we need to start standing up and pushing back against the establishment and their wokeist pawns in entertainment and in society at large if we want any chance of preserving whatever was worthwhile about our society as things continue to degrade and fall apart at the seams .
@graeme vaughey  not everyone likes turn based though the combat in ff7r and 15 is the reason I played and finished both
yeah that is why we dont have doaxv3 or vv in the west because of people like anita its ridiculous.
@antbaze97  I got a copy of dead or alive extreme 3.     cant stop me anita!
@graeme vaughey  yea they do have turn based games its called romance saga. go play that.
@antbaze97  15 is a dogshit game it looks good and that entirely it nothing other than that about that game is good they spent too much money paying fashion designers to make clothes for the game than they did on making the gameplay good
@graeme vaughey  honestly someone needs to sit down with them with common sense  from the west and tell them no one likes modern day western sensibilities its just appeals to a small minority of people I dont even buy these games
the problems started when the jp companies set foot on california and the likes. otherwise  when tou have little influence from these diversity addicts in the development process  you end with masterpieces like elden ring. the sooner we send the message to japan that we like their stuff the way it is  the better ours chances of preserving it like that
its not anita  its all about the esg ratings. if you dont know what that is  then just know that they are why woke companies dont go broke  even though nobody wants to buy their products. the more woke your company is  the higher its  esg  rating  and the more of our tax money the company is given by our governments.why bother taking a risk on making a videogame  sometimes they succeed  sometimes not   when you can just churn out woke garbage and be garuenteed free tax money  its the perfect grift for these companies  its garuenteed money  and you and I are forced to pay for it when the taxman cometh.
but you ll still buy their games  its on you beta gaming simps
@ziggy bean  oh dont you worry  youre paying these companies too  like it or not.
sharing what you love with the wrong people is a good way to also lose what you love.
@mark witt  eh I dont think 15 combat is that bad in my opinion is a good game just very rushed espceially in the last section of the game
yet when she launched feminist frequency tropes vs women  she outright lied through her teeth and said she s a gamer and has played many games. she s awful.
she also used footage from other people in her videos because she couldn t be bothered to play the games herself  plus her deleted video about bayonetta really showed she couldn t be bothered to play any bit of it as she did not know the character used her hair as clothing and attacks  as she claimed the character wears leather and takes it off for no reason when doing special attacks.
@joseph jackson  she all so lied on hitman no doubt about others
@warion musk  thats feminist in general
100
Ive been watching the reboot of tomb raider series very closely and I didn t see any woke or sjw agenda at all. remember  the lara croft from the 90s was your typical over the top gaming of your time and nobody griped about it until now. this version of lara is more of how she became the woman we all know and love since the 90s but placed in the sense of survival setting while balanced with action. this was attempt to rival uncharted just like the 90s version was to rival indiana jones. every female character after that in gaming like assassin s creed after blackflag and rogue  violet is the introduction to insufferable whamen characters with her endless teabagging you by calling you  numbskull  every step of the way  and even far cry series after 4 have shown to carry the obnoxious  all conquering whamen  narrative.
what respawn dev selfdeleted himslelf  try to not get shadowbanned  I only know about the night in the woods developer alec holowaka but nothing about some respawn dev.
@graeme vaughey  I agree
where exactly is this pushback coming from  breadtube and other far-left propaganda who defend this moral authoritarian is very popular on twitch and youtube. the old skeptic community who had the courage to push back against this stuff either went woke or went into equally regressive hard right politics. how can we win and make games great again like in the 90 s and early 00 s
the sad fact is that the average person doesnt really care about politics and will tolerate whatever they have to in order to keep conflict out of their life. its much better to just shut up and quietly accept than to cause a big stink and get nasty stares from your friends.
she sounds like william thomas to me....
I really hope melanie sees this  as any gamer should know  the game is never over until the main character wins. we  gamers are the protagonists. anita is the villain of this game and even if she wonthis battle  she will never win the war!!
keep up the excellent work  melonie. youre awesome.
she may say  we won  but in actuality what she did was the start of 2 wars.   the destruction and limitation of female charecters  if they are not feminist propaganda approve charecter then they are bad  in media.  and alongside microtransactions  the deterioment in quality of games for the past decade.also Imust point out that they haven t won since last of us 2  wolfenstein new blood and many others crash and burn follow her advice. beside like houston said once   the only battle that matters is the last one  and that hasn t yet come.
we need more people like you melonie cause your definitely a Godsend.
everything anita sarkeesain touches turns to shit. ask bioware about anthem and remaster of mass effect. she had her hand in both and they failed.
love the Bible verses and the prayer mel! please keep it up! one thing I got to add being a guy in gaming  is a majority of my favorite games star a female  shadow of the tomb raider  metroid  a plague s tale  innocence  horizon zero dawn  mass effect  male or female   older pokemon games  male or female   etc. I can go on and on of amazing games starred by a female. I think men and women are important in games. both can potray stories in different manners. I think women have a good spot in gaming honestly.
loving your content but also I love that you prayed for someone! you are amazing we need more of this!
anita sarkeesian  feminism has won in gaming!me  oh I dont think so.
I haven t been angry at video games in a while.  you see  thats the problem. the game s success rate could be correlated with how angry anita is.
now that time has past  its clear thatshe is just a run of the mill grifter.  she grifted as much money as possible while doing as little work as possible.
well woman hating women are a thing. here you have a non-gaming woman who inserted herself into an industry without insight or understanding and destroyed it because   reasons. the mental gymnastics required to keep up with their insane rules is mind boggling. disney doesnt want princesses to need to be rescued by men. at the same time females characters in games aren t allowed to be strong  independent  or attractive. ps  amen! be well  chris.
to say  I enjoyed this video  would be an understatement - this video all by itself was a huge blessing to me  especially towards the end.thanks for sharing  melonie mac go boom! and God bless you  sister  3
love your content on games  movies and pop culture. I also appreciate the spiritual aspect without beating people over the head with it . keep up the good work. subscribers 100k on the way!
if by  win  she means she successfully became a footnote in the history of video games. honestly  I almost forgot she still exists.
the only victory she has earned is the pyrrhic victory. thats the one kind of victory her kind would not want to win. but I do thank her for actually making others see and realize what precious things they loved about their games being worth protecting and gatekeeping.cuz the same tricks wont work ever again.
thank you for making this video.  we need women like you to help keep the last few remnants of sanity intact.
what an awesome channel. awesome to see you using your platform for good.
I wonder if she realizes you cant win a train wreck or claim domain over ashes in the wind.spoiler alert  she doesnt.
just saw this video by chance and I am surprised to say the least. I never figured there were many western females who were gamers and were actually critical of wokeness and identity politics. also  God bless you for caring for a fan of yours and not being ashamed to pray for them. respect.
absolutely amazing job snarkeezian! definitely drove the gaming industry to representing women appropriately  unremarkable and forgetable. couldn t have done any better.
what would you suggest we should do  honest question.
the last of us part two wasn t as woke as some people say it is.
@antarescross88  well  if we have the oportunity to create entretaiment created with out fallow this new puritist wishes. if we cant  vote with our wallet  and support artist that gives a damn about the products they create.
yep wonthe battle not the war big difference
@antarescross88   let the aaa companys fall and go indie . they cant touch them they make the game they want to make.
@centrevez gaming   shes olny won a few battles . the gamers have won more than 2.
@antarescross88  what the others said  vote with your wallet. it might hurt a bit to not play the latest everyone is talking about  but chances are it will be pretty bland  if not straight up shit. want more quality games  dont buy the shity ones. look at elden ring  for example  massive success and practically free of all that woke bs.also  indie devs and smaller studios. the more you support them  the more they ll be able to make stuff you like. and lastly  the ol  gatekeeping practice. itsucks  I know  but it will hurt more in the future if you dont do it
@araujo jhonatan  I already practice the  voting with my wallet  thing  a lot. about gatekeeping I agree but I really dont know how to do it. Imean its not like I have power to stop someone from buying something.what can be done about this according to you
@graeme vaughey  I got so sick of hearing about deathloop at sort of video game event that over aggressive marketing was annoying
@antarescross88  well  youre right in that we cant really stop someone from buying something  or stop them from joining a certain fandom  in the case of gatekeeping. best we can do is exactly this  talk.explaining to others why we re gatekeeping on top of doing so helps too. nobody wants to be that guy who s an ass on the lobby  but we ought to do it. when someone starts to cause trouble  and by now we all cantell the signs from a mile  call them out and if possible  isolate them.you and me alone cant do much  but the more people we get to walk into the same direction  the better we can form a line and hold these weirdos back. thats how we got here to begin with.
@graeme vaughey  dishonored 2 didn t really seem that woke to me. had no idea  they were taking her advice on it though.
@antbaze97  perhaps not  but you cant say that they didn t take anita into account when creating someone that looks like abby
you forgot to mention that while the sequel before youngblood may have been successful  it did not generate better sales than wolfenstein  the new order. and many like me consider new order the only title from the wolfenstein series because of the female characters in new colossus and the fact it jumped the shark.
not in japan!
I love japanese culture.
it only won in the woke american aaa games industrythere s no wokeness in china   japan
she successfully drove the market from mainstream into indie studios. this is a big opportunity for developers to publish content mainstream studios cant because of her.
I discovered you from your fnt appearance.  Ive been watching more and more of your vids since then and Im loving your content.  especially since we seem to have a lot of similar beliefs.we both do not like wokeness and how its negatively affecting entertainment and the country.   I also eating carnivore and absolutely love it.   now today I see you are also a Christian!!!  seeing you pray on video was great.  I really admire people who aren t afraid to tell others of their religious beliefs.  its something Ive had trouble with in the past so you are a great encouragement to me.
sigh I thought we were done with anita being in the gaming news.
it was so refreshing to hear a young person pray on camera. that immediately got my subscription. God-bless you
melonie  what do you think about anita basically being a scam artist that was using feminism as a force field from any criticsm.
are like the worst people you wanna listen to  thats about as family friendly a way as you can put it.
she ran her mouth for years trying to destroy female characters as if it was a good thing. a truly toxic person. we need to pray for her... speaking of which prayed in agreement with you for chris as well and I ll add to that with psalm 103. also  yes to Godzilla! hail to the king!
does that mean she will finally leave gaming alone
I have to say aloy has been one of my favorite female game characters released in the past years. she was a beautiful redhead who could kick ass. and her costumes weren t bad at all as far as the  sexism  stuff goes
its a lie that her comments section  queen anita s  were filled up with comments.. she closed those off along with hiding unlikes and likes. so much for a  discussion.
happy birthday chris.   prayers and keep fighting.
female characters became mostly bland  traditionally masculine protagonist archetypes.if her aim was to win in that regard  then yeah  well done anita...
what s more sad is that we all allowed it to happen.
anita sarkeesian and her ilk may have changed the industry  but it doesnt mean us gamers are happy about it.  great job praying on camera for the first time! it was my first time praying along with a youtuber.
yoooooo! this is my first time seeing one of your videos and the way you stopped and prayed for that young man mid video was a pleasant surprise! Im inching towards thatsubscribe button.
I have to say  Im really glad I found this channel.its such a relief to find someone who is more than willing to share her opinions on strong subjects  and is also open to others. its also so amazing that you and I share faith in our Lord God  and I am honored to have you as a sister in Christ. a cute  entertaining  and friendly gamer girl! you ve helped give me validation on my opinions on things like  woke  lara croft  because previously Ive been hanging around a crowd that made me feel guilty and ashamed of it. I was trying to bury a part of myself out of fear of being disrespectful and the bad guy  but you helped show me that my opinons are just as valid  and a lot of people out there are on my side.I will keep an eye on this channel  with great interest! stay awesome!
the only reason she  won  anything is because people let her. the game devs listened to her when she never had an interest in gaming  now we have bs like this.
yes she s right for now and eventually these corporations will realize how dumb they are being when they lose too much money. bad ideas eventually kill anything regardless to how successful it is.
mel has an adorable personality and is so down to earth!
japanese is all about story telling and character development  that is why people love them  to see the character thrive. pushing story and character  not ideology.
only until she needs attention.
lol certainly not. she will go after indie games next and then propably japan.
nope so gotta make sure to tell your indy game developers what you want to see and that thry need to listen to the people willing to buy the product they produce. so many of the people crying about pc culture dont even pay into what they are trying to change or shame
@robovader  japan is heroically resisting all this bs for years now. squeenix has already fallen cuz they are with soyny but nintendo is as usual doing weird shit and now actually giving fans what they want.
been seeing nothing but anime for the past 5 years. maybe I ll watch invincible and arcane soon.
on a positive note  her meddling made me pick another hobby. for others  they could enjoy older games but I easily get bored doing that. God forbid her ilk moves to the cycling industry. lol
hey Im glad I found your channel  this woke culture is definitely destroying the industry I hope companies are realizing that most ppl cant stand this pc stuff. anyways nice to see a strong woman is who is nerdy and isn t afraid to express her faith in God.
anita sarkeesian is the reason Im so right wing.all those years ago I was not at all interested in politics  I didn t vote and generally thought I was a liberal.then along comes an evil woman who wanted to destroy my hobby and introduced me to the idea that people hate me for being a straight white man.before her I had no idea.after her I will never vote for a politician on the left for the rest of my life.so thank you feminism and thank you anita because you taught me how to be a alt right nazi.
glad we have cool chicks like melonie taking up the torch of real femininity.stay awesome girl!
melonie  Im glad to hear you say you believe in miraculous healing! Ive encountered some in the church who dont believe that miracles happen anymore  that they were only for a certain age and time  and I think thats such a sad view for a believer to take. you are right  we are not guaranteed a life of physical health and temporal happiness  but miracles do occur. and even when they do not  the greatest miracle of all has already occurred  Christ rose again  and with that he defeated sin and its consequences. cling to the cross  and better days will always find you.
zelda has been both a warrior albeit in disguise and a pirate leader way before her bs. she changed nothing but loves to feel important
I like how the creator about  tropes vs women in video games  became a living trope herself  about how she ll never finish her work and simply leech off others.
9 08 you truly are a sincere individual. I pray that more of us will gather in his name. and thanks to infected_chris for his request or we would not have witnessed melonie s first youtube prayer.
for someone who never finished what they tried to start.... it is kind of hilarious thatshe feels she won when she failed herself....cha-ching!
I have some projects Im working on myself  and I dont feel like they need to have sexy female characters  but now I feel like putting them into my stuff out of spite for her  even though we all know deep down she s dead in the water
you make such good points. videogames have suffered in quality  lately. yes there are some titles that break through the sarkisian wall  but those are few and far between. I hope people continue to call out the regressive wokeness in the gaming industry so we can have more truly memorable characters. specifically female characters who ve suffered most at the hands of this  feminist  movement.
reminds me of the meme where shows comic strip of what actually looks like her body was also the armor and take off wearing regular clothes underneath and takes off cause someone brought up her armor doesnt give mech protection. then she says  youreally thinks so   lol
she did change gaming yes  but in terms of winning...   she s an old  old woman now... with her egg basket drying up  and her last remaining eggs becoming more and more stale by the day  while she lusts for conservative men on  lol  twitter.so yes  she won a battle  but she lost the war.
thats the reason why japanese games  korean thaI shows  japanese anime are so huge world-wide today. games like yakuza  elden ring  persona get reserved recognition because western players are trying to find games that are not destroyed by activists.
bet she wont stop even after  winning video games .
God damn dude youre shredded. props.
I always wanted the industry to have a huge reset given practices over the last few years  microtransactions  lootboxes  yearly releases of the same damn game with minimal changes  etc.  so hopefully her  victory  will help get us to that point faster.
we will always find a way to bypass their bs.
you need to invite her on the show and have a debate
I almost forgot about anita... she is the reason why western games are the way they are now...also  me   chris have the same birthday   Im praying for you bro!  3
I prefer to be moderate because both sides of the political spectrum have done some bad shit  most of which are similar to one another. if a presidential candidate shows good moral standing  no matter how they re politically aligned  I d vote for them.
@nictomahawk  except moderates and centrists are considered right wing nowadays.  th left has gone so far left...
@nictomahawk  still in that paradigm huh  haven t we seen enough already  pay attention again. who s in charge when things go down the line
yep same here. they came in on us!
welcome my brother in arms. let us purge the far left from our spaces  letting the center left breathe a bit easier and the rest of us having actual debate.
@man of truth  amen
@elucidus  I have lived long enough to see j.k rowling being lumped together with the far right. wild times to be alive lmao
the answer to extremism isn t more extremism.
@max gehtdnixan   I dont know anyone on the right or in the middle that would do that.  but the left  its wild.  trying to get them to see how racist they are acting is a challenge sometimes.
I was exactly like you. before 2016 I never cared about politics and stuck to video games and anime but when I learned about anita and what she was doing that all changed.
@nerdic warrior  being an alt right nazI is not ok I hope he was joking because nazism is serious . you dont attack extremism with more extremism .
@spartan300  thats not what I was implying. I was nearly stating that before I learned about anita I never cared about politics. I am not a nazI  or an extremist or alt right.
@nerdic warrior  dude Im not offended or concerned about that but you tube are now flagging certain words and potentially pass them on to authorities   I knew your comment was sarcasm   have to be careful thats all . I used to play games a lot when all this woke nonsense didn t happen   not so much these days   so I didn t miss out at least
@timeofragnarok  nobody s advocating  extremism   whatever that actually means. first of all  what people commonly call  far right  isn t  right wing  ideologically in pretty much any historically and philosophically coherent sense of the word. secondly   extremeism  being good or bad is entirely relative to the quality of the idea about which someone is being  extreme.  for someone s beliefs to he  extreme  only inherently implies the degree of one s conviction and commitment to one s ideas. it only inherently means thatsomeone holds strong and deeply held convictions about something and isn t willing to compromise on those beliefs. whether or not thats a good or bad thing entirely depends on the belief or policy about which you are being  extreme  and uncompromising. it has nothing inherently to do with violence since it is entirely possible for someone to be an extremist about something like pacifism  for example. ends dont justify means  but extremism about virtue  liberty and justice is no vice.
@tyler w  anything at all taken to the extreme becomes harmful. wether you like it or not doesnt matter.
@nictomahawk  centrism and pretended neutrality  is what brought us here.
@timeofragnarok  no  but in their extreme world view  normal is the extreme opposite
thats what feminists are. they focus too much on the immediate battles that they lacked the foresight of what the results of their actions do in the long run. just look at lia thomas recently winning the women s swimming competition.
wait  which conservative dudes is she thirsting after  any evidence of this
we will win like gg. we just out last them.
thats kind of what Im hoping for as well.
its to the point where alternative gaming studios need to be supported and funded and gatekeep the crap out of them.
sarkeesian giving me chills. dont like being told what to game  to. keep up with that great content . melonie mac
comic book girl 19 said something that made a lot of sense not just in the gaming industry but in comic books and in movies female characters aren t allowed to be fun and goofy they have to be serious and the fun stuff goes to the guys media is filled with  no-fun mommy s  now
I love when people stick their nose in an industry they aren t a fan of and have no interest in  like as did. it would be like me making a bunch of videos about drag shows and trying to change the culture around it. but I just do something crazy and let them be and I go my separate way.
that was 10 years ago! holy shit  time goes by fast.I completely forgot that woman even exists.
I can honestly say that I have never ever met a single person  male or female  that enjoys gaming more for the  work  anita sarkeesian has done. less enjoyment or indifference  yes. but a truly positive impact on those who enjoy games  no.
my wife and I honestly think with your growing platform you should gather forces with other popular female gamers with the same or similar mind set  and fight back against this bs woke cancer that has infected gaming.
she wants to ruin   destroy everything fun but no more she s a bully   someone needs to put anita in her place
it is amazing to me that this woman and her misguided ideals managed to taint two of my all-time favorite franchises  tomb raider and last of us  to the point that each tr release is so much less exciting and I dont even want to play tlou2.
she lied about video games and gamers for attention and money. is it really surprising that people hate her
with regards to the old lara croft  style  I can see she has never done a single day s hard labour in the sun and in the dirt because if anita had  she would know that lara s outfit is exactly what you would wear.
we need to bring back strong feminie interesting women and anyone who can create can do their part to ring them back but thats just a suggestion  and great video
a part of me says give her everything she wants and see how it all pans out  so she cant complain to anyone.
I really haven t been able to keep on top of new games since Ive only been playing swtor.  I do like when the game adds platforming aspects like tomb raider  unfortunately server lag doesnt play too well with it.  last  modern gen  console I had was ps3 and I played heavenly sword on it.  loved that game.  have a blessed day.
not sure why people who does not even play video games need to input their agenda into gaming  great job melonie as always keep the haters hate we still care for your input
hey at least she admits victory which means she might be satisfied and stop  unlike her goalpost moving peers
wait  did she  win  or not   if you  won   then your goal was achieved.  her work should be done  and she can crawl back under her safe space.  the fact thatshe doesnt know what  won  means should be  yet another  important indicator that anita has no clue about games of any kind.  maybe she thinks  won  means  participated     either way  the sooner she moves on to take on something that I dont care about  the sooner I can be happier.maybe she could look at troped in the vietnamese tv game shows   sorry vietnam  someone has to take one for the team .
I bet she is like this person saying  I won  in a argument  just run.
if winning equals utter destruction then yeah she won.
5 56 lara croft talk starts here!!
p.s. this wasn t a sexuality thing  I could have inserted knitting  or stamp collecting.
the opposite of love isn t hate  its indifference.   raizorfist
and a female I loved the old lara croft. thought the new one was sort of dumb and nver played any of the new sequals after the new tomb raider.
last of us was tainted on conception  and if it is your favourite franchise I recommend you find better games.  it I had the time I could list 50 franchises that are better.
@purpleguy319  the last of us  the first one  was pretty good but definitely not a masterpiece. will have to agree with you
@sheepdog  more a movie rather than a game  and stereotypical emotional story tbh
she did it  she managed to make people less interested in western media  and now we are waiting for good eastern media that we actually likethe only franchises that will be do as good as always will be cod and probably what will come from fifa
whether they agreed or disagreed  people listened to her. yes she won.
good luck infected_chris. I pray that you get better. stay strong.
yup she won all right and it totally broke the big game studios. unfortunately it didn t just infect gaming  it infected everything  the companies we work for  the stock market  the media  hollyweird  etc.
bet you can hear the indie devs @  hole squeak shut around the world from this interview
original lara croft adapted to look more like angelina jolie which she herself looks very attractive. the reboot games made by square enix she looks good but of course she is 21 in the first game. angelina was 25 when she was lara in the first movie. I like video games with female characters that are attractive  as I am a man. in video games where the character can be chosen to be male or female most of men choose female and most of women choose male characters. if youre going to be staring at the back of a character for hours  it minds well be something appealing to the eyes when it comes to games using the third person perspective. mass effect I like fem shep andromeda I play as the female twin  skyrim most of my characters are female  and no I dont use mods that make the armors look like bikinis I use armor mods that match the body style if I use a body mod so she doesnt look different if she isn t in armor from when she is in armor.
the funniest thing about anita- when reviewing the  hitman  series she had a huge problem with the fact that your character  could  shoot a stripper and stuff her body in a trunk. it wasn t something you were supposed to do  nor was it condoned or encouraged in the game  but anita immediately starts shooting strippers and trying to hide the bodies...  I never even thought of doing anything like that while playing the game and Im a straight-white-male with miles of toxic masculinity. as my kung fu teacher used to say   you accuse others of your own negative thoughts.  in other words  she thinks that men  hate women  because she does...
it only ends if developers start showing up who give her and her ilk the finger and make the games the way they want.
I think anita sarkeesian affected my personal life more negatively than any actual person in power in my whole life.
when I saw anita sarkisian in your thumbnail I had to check the date of the video.
if her goal was to make video games worse  mission accomplished. can we blame micro-transactions on her  too
king kong vs Godzilla is epic!  the only one that is actually laugh-out-loud funny while still being a big production with an evil g  by  60s standards .  nobody in their right minds would think sea monster   megalon   son of   revenge   or gigan is better
lara croft talk starts at 5 57
she won  in politics and in the culture war as well. but Lord kratos has taught us that vengeance is possible.
we all tried to ignore anita sarkeesian but she yelled louder with her woke messages until she got what she wanted...
also...praying openly on your video is awesome!
male gamer comment  I dont believe that you are being rational in your thought process.    anita   omg  Im under attack.  they are calling me horrific names!
Im team Godzilla as well melonie  and another great video.
anita just wants revenge on the dudes who wont date her!
didn t sarkeesian say that the design of bayonetta was sexist but in actual fact the design of the umbra witch was done by marI shimazakI a female designer at platinum games.
nah the best one was when she was putting her livestreams out and one of them she started killing prostitutes in gta v and saying that you profited off abusing women and then immediately got a 2 star wanted level and killed by the police... and tried to play it off as  male power fantasy  xd.
@james calder  or her game concept  the legend of the last princess  which was supposed to be a response to all of those who asked her what a game would look like if she made one. her  game  is one big contradiction. she includes several things thatshe s been complaining about in other games such as the use of violence and gender signifiers. all the characters are white  so much for diversity  and it doesnt even seem to pass the bechdel test since the main character is the only female.
she emboldened her critics and everyone that disagreed as well. she incensed the majority and turned them against everything she stands for  when they may have had no opinion whatsoever. not sure she wonthe culture war as it isn t over.
I hope so but I fail to see how.     what can actually be done
she did  and if I remember correctly she deleted that video  presumably out of embarrassment at her usual lack of research.
sarkeesian has made this very personal
9 00 wow melonie Im shocked thats the first time you prayed on camera  just one favor though  take care of brittany ventI will ya  and make sure I both get to see you in heaven  be the big sis thats there for her  spiritually and emotionally .its gonna suck not seeing her  over there if anything happens. so Im kind of holding youresponsible. thanks for the vid though.
question  does anita believe that video games have influence of real life behavior
this is why gate keeping 15 to 20 years ago was a thing
never much cared for any group that wants games to be catered to their preferences but have no intentions to buy the game or even play video games. they have done the same shit with movie and tv. its fine to have a scene like ruffnutt in how to train your dragon 2 where she is watching eric is cranking on a winch s wheel and she is oggling him. but if a movie did that with a woman cranking on the winch and a man was watching it would be considered appealing to the  male gaze . I know that is a kid s movie but that is put in for the adult audience for comedy purposes but that also is kind of a double standard the new wave feminist has for women in films. its fine for women to oggle men but if men do it to women its wrong. anita is one of those  activist  that doesnt play video games. but developers consult her on them. which I find very distasteful. developers should make games that appeal to as many people as possible to sell as many copies as they can. not appeal to a very small group and then complain that most didn t fork out the cash for the game and it was a failure. people like her have destroyed the industry not improved it. you cant build things with a sledgehammer.
been liking your video lately keep speaking your mind
re  laura croft. I haven t played too many of the tomb raider games  but growing up I always heard of her as a badass and what I have played supported that... until the new games. the new games just seem to be torture porn as even when you succeed the qtes she gets injured severely. I dont care if she has the same name  the lady who got stabbed 15 times on a supposedly deserted island is not the same woman who found mjolnir and fought a demon with it.
its easy to declare victory  when your the one thatstarts the war and sets the conditions.
pretty sure I remember hearing that a lot of women were playing the God of war games on ps2. looking at kratos s muscles  imagine now with the extra muscles and manly beard!
she succeeded in influencing games that pushed politics ahead of story  or anything else for that matter. so we got a few games that blew their load in the first month of their release  with the politics taking center stage. so congrats  I guess  in turning certain games into soulless drivel.
its been 10 years of this nightmare
God be with you chris!
great content great job
Im glad you believe in healing  Ive been dealing with ocd my whole adult life and some have told me that maybe God gave this to me for his glory and will  of course I wanted to punch them in the face! I would appreciate it if you would pray for me as well.  to be healed and forgive those people for being a doofus!
its bullying. the same thing we ve been dealing with since middle school. then it was jocks and  cool kids  throwing my book on the ground  or making fun of my shirt  or whatever  because I was just some nerd. now its the woke and  allies  trying to ruin our hobby. and they dont even try to hide it -- they brag about  the fanboys hate it  and drink from cups labeled  fanboy tears . its not about equality  its not about representation  its not even about the message  they just want to make other people unhappy because its the only satisfaction they can get out of their own pathetic lives. and thats sad.
she says her life changed after thatseries... well  with all that money she got to make serious docu and ending up making crap  well mine life would be changed too....
this woman is right up there with brianna and zoe in terms of women I want to yeet in front of a bus.
I literally forgot she existed.
her  tropes  series was full of lies and fabrications. hell one that was so blatant that itstuck in my head and remember it 10 years later is her talking about women in games being objects  and she uses an example from hitman where there are two strippers. she s talking about how the game encourages and even rewards players for beating  killing and dragging around women s bodies  but clearly in the video she s showing you see the player losing points for doing any of that.of course anyone that called her out on any of the lies were accused of being sexiest and harassing her.
anitta is the worst kind of person  someone who legit does t know or want to know what she is talking about  there are videos of her saying thatshe never played games  but still talked and complain about. the worst part is  she made some impact  there are videos of for exemple neil druckman  director of the last of us 1 and 2  saying that her series helped him and changed his mind.
I wish these people would go after news shows  reality shows  and tabloid shows instead of movies  comics  cartoons  and video games.
it only goes to show how predatory thatsort of behavior is and how it likes to persist way beyond childhood with some adults who never really grow out of it  thus  also bring it with them where ever they go.
we need to gatekeep from these tumblr weirdos
she s right  just look what they ve done to my boy.
now what we need is either a  Godzilla vs gamera   or  Godzilla vs ultraman  movie.
melonie   I ain t a dude! my brain  correct. you are far too beautiful to be a dude. lol.
anita s only victory is getting female characters to be more bland looking and even thats not solely because of her.  hopefully we ll start seeing more indie games as a response.
great video  melonie...
she won! and her personal bank account will show it!
the sole reason why she made female characters into forgetable nothings is because if she actually managed to get more girls to play and actually fix the problem she d be out of a job
every time I see or hear something out of her mouth  it reminds me of the line in that jim carrey movie liar liar... my teacher says beauty is on the inside    thats just something ugly ppl say .
...they re just gonna have to be a dynamic duo at this point.  I beg to differ  there is a little something called a rom-com just for such circumstances.
blood rayne was one of my favorites.
10 18 seems like someone got beer-bug and lost its tast in movies... shame that dude
what games is anita playing  because I dont know what the hell she s talking about. last I remember anita and joss whedon were getting friendly with each other. then joss got exposed for being a creeper. oh me  oh my. prayers up for chris.
I assume she means her version of feminism.
hope you will survive chris!
its really awful how people like sarkezian pretend to be fans only to shoehorn and strongarm their preferences into mediums games  video games  movies and tv shows  and ruin it for everyone when nothing was wrong to begin with.
if she is now coming for indy games  how can she say she won
since you like the monster films so much - what did you think about rampage  its a film about a friendly guerrilla called george xd
she s right. and everybody and everything is worse off for it. damn  Imiss how things used to be...
moral authoritarianism and the death of artistic freedom won in gaming.
maybe this is why indie games have become so much more popular....
all because people thought if they were mean enough  vile enough she would go away. people like that gave her power. the hate made her strong. learn from this.
first Bible verses and now prayer   this is great!  also that entire isaiah chapter  53  is just one of the best chapters of the old testament.
just like that episode of sponge bob where they  saved the city .
unfortunately for people like anita sarrkeesian they dont get to choose what people want to produce  at the end of the day an artist is going to make the art they want to make and no one has to like it or purchase it. if these people want their games to portray women in a specific way then they are free to produce their own games. I personally would never change my particular art style because some people dont like it or agree with it. art doesnt have to be feminist  inclusive  progressive or diverse.
not cut and dry. they definitely had an effect on and killed some major properties the last of us 2 comes to mind  but even then  gaming has weathered this shitstorm much better than say hollywood for example. plenty of w s and l s going both ways. still plenty of buff dudes and hot women going around
did you enjoy the 1st episode of moon knight
Imay not be a Christian but I will still ask my Gods to help heal chris
if by won  she means it ruined it ......than yes
with today s verse it is not only physical wounds that God heals. it is also our wounds in our soul. in 2015 my mom died. because of God my wounds from her death are healed and fortunately because of her salvation  we had a great relationship and did not had any bad blood. praise God.
if thats true that would be every gaming company going banqupt
when neil druckmann simped catered to anita sarkeesian and made last of us 2
Im confused as to how or why anyone in the gaming community or industry ever listened to her. they should make her a character in the next mortal kombat game  so mileena can eat her face off.
indie games be like tf did we do lol
she may have won  but I can also win by not spending my hard earned money on games like that.. if this is how most modern games are gonna continue Im fine with sticking to older games for good.
you have a big heart - the prayer on video was amazing. rooting for you chris.I suppose I should thank anita for the many hours Ive spent with kassandra  but that doesnt make up for what she and her kind did to bioware and my beloved mass effect franchise rip.
you know that once this happens  profits will inevitably fall.
if she got all that money to finish the series  and she didn t  should she refund the money
if she won  does that mean she ll stop now is it that easy  tell her she won. she doesnt play games so she wont find out.someone distract her by telling her that women in the fashion industry need to be saved.
there s always games like elden ring you will never infiltrate. looking forward to the demise of those companies that do.
I collect Godzilla stuff and the 1962 king kong vs Godzilla s design of Godzilla is my fave. I like the face and thighs
saying goes  even if you aren t interested about politics politics is interested in you. what makes it creepy is that the interest that it has on us might not have anything to do with our well-being despite of how sjws may appeal to our sympathy. keep your own art close to you and never budge an inch to the demands and tactics of these snake oil salesmen.
thank you! I just got home not too long ago and my mrI looks great! the best news is the boring news when it comes to scans.
all roads lead back to gamergate.
mainstream culture is always one independent thought away from extinction.
hope infected_chris is ok
ok  well this is both funny and disappointing I use vanced to watch yt videos.  vanced has some interesting optional settings  including being able to auto-skip over sponsor-   promotion segments.  it is a valuable option  and usually works fantastic - but this video had a huge skip in it.  scrolling back and trying to get it to play didn t work and it took me a couple of minutes to find the setting and turn it off.  with it off  the prayer comes through and is beautiful.it turns out that its not some aImagic  its a crowd-sourced control - so  somebody  somewhere  considered a public prayer requesting healing to either be   a sponsored segment  -   or  a promotional segment.  -doh  crowd people  you so cray-cray.
anita sarkeesian is nothing more than a hack grifter who barged into an industry she wanted to control. how is itshe and her ilk say they want empowered women  then they erase them from media  and no one notices even after years of not playing tomb raider anniversary  legends  and underworld. I remember classic lara croft. its been a couple of years since playing every game in the reboot trilogy  I can barely remember the reimagining of lara croft.regina from dino crisis 1 and 2 is a weapons expert.  granted the games dont give us much if any information about any of the characters. even gale  rick  and dillan. I dont want a reboot because it ll more than likely be woke. blood rayne gives a legitimate reason for rayne s quest for revenge in blood rayne 2.  he didn t just kill my mother   I cant put the next bit because youtube.  or drive her insane. he killed her entire family. it wasn t even personal. it was just his sick policy to make sure I had no one to turn to but him.   I know this is long but compare rayne to abby since laura baily played both. and tell me who deserves their revenge. after typing these  I think the problem is with how anita sarkeesian views things. she sees women as objects and thus projects how she sees characters outwards.
melonie mac. straight male gamer of the year. lolol
sarkeesian is proof that you can use pandering and virtue signaling as a means to make a living without creating anything or adding anything useful to the conversation.
well  its time that we make our own industry and replace the one thatshe destroyed.
as an indie developer... she cantry to come for us. I ll make what I want.
Godzilla vs gigan is my favorite Godzilla movie.  it was also my first Godzilla movie and introduced me to angruirus my favorite kaiju next to ghidorahmy most hated is a tie between Godzilla vs megalon   son of Godzilla
imagine princess peach in fucking overalls lmao omg yesss let me risk my lives fighting turtles and ghosts to save the female mechanic
there s a female character in a game coming out called wanted  dead  that hasn t been beaten to death with the ugly meh stick like a far too many female characters in this modern era of gaming.  when compared to the girls of dead or alive or ninja gaiden  which  ironically  the developers of those aforementioned titles are behind wanted  dead  so hopefully that means she wont get ugly d up or be a lefty politics dispensary  like far too many other female characters .  here s a few trailers of the game in question 1  announcement trailer - https   youtu.be aethccqqe_e2  sxsw trailer - https   youtu.be t7ha_vmmq70 3  valentine s day trailer  cheesy corniness warning  but contains subtle possible game details  - https   youtu.be v2-mfzjgxkw I figured you might like her a little bit  given how much you like other beautifully-bad@    brown-haired babes like lara croft and others.  Im unsure of the games challenge level  it might be fairly high  given that this is made by the teams behind 2 games that were somewhat notorious for their difficulty  to some anyway  hot sure how anyone else handled it
I heard she s the one working on the knights of the old republic remake... is it true
anita s revenge against the 3.5 billion men who find her repulsive is complete.
she succeeded in creating one of the most boring times in the videogames industry  when technology is the most advanced they could create masterpieces  but instead they re creating boring games with boring stories  just because she was jealous of video game character and wanted all the male attention for her.
this lady is based
love the show. go Godzilla!
she did win  we lost the culture war.
itshould be a youtube rule that any time a video is done on this woman  the first clip must always be the one where she admits she doesnt play video games and was never into it.
just found your channel and subscribed after watching this video  not even half-way .I thought we had strong female leads in videogames already. anyone remember chun-lI  when she first appeared in 1991 in street fighter 2  what was itshe was saying  every time you lose to her   Im the strongest woman in the world! ps amen - praying for chris to be healed too. . . .
I just found out thatskipped segments are color-coded.  the segment was categorized under sponsor   paid promotions  paid referral  or direct advertisements.hillllarious!
we also need to start our own independent tv stations  and air stuff the the broadcast  and cable channels wont air anymore.
I support indie developers I support farm 51 ww3 they enjoy the fans
I agree  there is plenty wrong with the gaming industry  but none of what is wrong with it has anything to do with made up social injustice.
I like the verse of the day. it was used in the the passion of the Christ. I saw just yesterday that mel is making the passion of the Christ resurrection.
yes  they have won some of the culture battles  but the war dont end yet.
thankfully we still have japanese games   look at malenia from elden ring and tell me she s not strong female character. and yet she is feminine and literally naked in the second half of her boss battle
@melony mac. do you ever  have plans to or would ever  cosplay as laura croft  I also think you would make an awesome jill valentine too.
when initially seen a female character in battlefield v agina   which was hisorically inaccurate   I knew thatsarkeesian had won  sadly.
while sarkeesian might be right about winning...its mostly in aaa games. while indies banded the knee  those ones usually aren t that popular if they follow sarkeesian play book. I say let her have aaa  those games are mostly bad  unless from certain japanese companies  these days anyway so let her have that. indies have a lot of old school stuff in them  that also meaning femme fatals. or games like haydee that are hardcore and unapologetically sexy to ridiculous degree which I like. plus pc can mod games to take away the stuff people dont like and make it more what you want.in all honesty  Im sure that the people doing those tomb raider fan remakes and games who you have showcased  will end up making spiritual successors. let anita stay on the dying side of the hobby  real fans have a lot of talent to make great stuff and they will have gamers support. ones the old aaa dies out  new one will take its place from the indie scene  from those who have talent and can make entertaining products.that or Im overly optimistic  I dunno  xdd
I wouldn t say she won  I would say everybody in entertainment industry is just like her. thats why it was so easy. these people most are democrats.
like a few others have mentioned  she might damn well be correct. look at something like mortal kombat 11  a franchise that was invented to offend people. even that game bowed to the far left with respect to their female character designs. thats just one game  but you could go on and on.
someone said   everything woke turns to shit.
anita s argument is not fair in term damsel and distress  because games she mainly speaks about are games with little technology to tell a more sophisticated story  thats why the saving princess or saving the world premise was implemented mostly because it was simple and didn t take much ideas without taking alot of memory but instead to focus on gameplay than anything else. thats way we started to have a shift and advancement on technology to tell different stories when we got ps1 and other thirty-two bit consoles.
being called a sexist by a feminist these days is like being called a doodiehead by a five-year-old. hopefully gaming companies catch on to this sooner than later.
if she sais so then it is so.
what is it with people like anita and thinking all that matters is who the lead character is look at anya from gears of war. she isn t the lead character but as an intelligence officer whose job it is to watch over and advise multiple squads of soldiers I can damn well place a bet thatshe s the single most important soldier there.like their obsession with who the lead is spits in the face of every other incredible character within games.
thats why I play retro games
you had it right. they think they won but they didnt. male characters are still able to be expressive and over the top  these characters will become beloved icons  female characters have become boring and subdued  there will be less of them remembered. celest is a great game but no one remembers that character
God always answers prayers for healing. the healing could be immediate  eventual  or eternal.
yeah  pretty much. its sad  but it is what it is. its nothing new  nor will itstop with gaming or comic books. soon japanese media will give into it too. looking at forspoken and the marketing  they might be already bending to it. what s ironic is back in the 90s and 00s   I wouldn t have thought twice about buying a game or watching a show with a female protagonist. female characters are some of my favorite characters after all  just like real women are some of my favorite people. then people like anita showed up and made itso it was about making a female lead game for the sake of being able to say  see  we aren t sexist. look  she s hideous  which is realistic whereas attractive female characters are unrealistic . now I rarely buy western games with female protagonists  and if I see one I internally question what the motivation was. I like how they write them to be as unlikeable as possible for the sake of realism. at the end of the day  people like me aren t the people they make games for anymore. all I can do is vote with my wallet while I still can. once it all becomes a shitty streaming service  Im out. getting pissed off at the state of gaming is a young mans game.
are we really supposed to believe that most women would rather have their female characters look like abby from lou2 rather than a character like bayonetta
I say lure snarkeesian into playing  league of maidens
its all in flux. but basically  the money has the final say. these organizations dont run without profit. and they re making a lot of people upset.
yeah  she did stuff like go over the clothing of women in the God of war games without mentioning the main character  who has even less of it and you canturn at your will to the camera  as well as a utt naked raiden in mgs2  you also control and more ...I dont want to watch it again  but I remember from what Ive seen  that there wasn t anything that wasn t a half truth or a flatout lie  if thats winning  congratulations  then the rest of us will always loose...
bring back female villains who aren t just  misunderstood . Imiss evil women.
all she did was insert herself into a conversation that was already happening and fanned the flames for clout. that was it.she isn t even a gamer ffs
in the spirit of this subject we all owe it to ourselves to remember this badass red alert cutscene from 1996https   youtu.be orun22p8r3u t 660 anita trailblazed nothing
they destroyed the strong female character and replaced it with the human equivalent of a boiled potato.
literally the only female lead game I am waiting for is bayonetta 3! please dont touch bayonetta! I want my over the top provocative witch beating the shit out of monsters! I feel bayo is one of the few real videogame strong women we have left
you know if she only played the suikoden games... she d know that half or more of the 108 stars  characters  you collect are women.. strong fuckin women. like actually good written and badass
has she even played  no  the answer is no.
if the feminist sjw goal was to sink the gaming industry like they did the comic book industry  yeah  its definitely heading that way.  which is sad  because there are a lot of voice actresses whose recent choice of characters to play are just goofy.
indies run anita is coming close the door before its too late
on her playing the games I believe the answer was no. I seem to recall it being a big stinking point that at least one created could prove she stole her footage of their gameplay and one of the few games she did play  hitman  she went out of her way to  prove  how it was all about killing civilians and women in some strip club level despite the game penalizing her for killing  non targets . Imean there is footage of her saying she s not a gamer and didn t grow up playing games while she then claimed the polar opposite. she s a whiney grifter and Im pretty sure she s just wanting to restock the coffers before she disappears yet again. but as the old saying goes   an idiot and their money are soon parted  and anita is there to prove that true yet again!
we no longer have memorable and attractive female characters...for the most part.
anita hate videogames culture  she hate us. my first hero in video game was jill valentine from re  3
rpg video games should treat male and female characters like they do with races or classes. having male characters have certain strengths like physical strength and speed with weaknesses like lower agility and charisma. female characters would have the opposite and both genders would be finely balanced with each other.game developers usually just have different dialogue for males and females and it always feels a bit lazy and unrealistic how little difference in which gender you choose. game developers put so much effort in balancing classes and races but dont think gender has any real impact in a fantasy world. it would give more incentive to try both genders and have different experiences. also melonie  you rock!
I was going to make my own response here but annemie  nihI  nick napolI  zachman and otaku already combined together with their words to take my statement out of my mind and already put it in the comments.  no more need be said by me.  out!
God s will be done- I simply ask  guided those who are willing  saving  those who have ask  and help those who given into you. -for your will be done.this is my prayer give to you and now share with others so that they may be blessed and guided to be bettersemper fidelis
someone want to remind needy sarcuntsiaan that nearly every game she s been involved with had been a dud  anthem ring a bell at all  or how she was begging cd projekt to hire her or she d cry  sexism  in cyberpunk  they didn t win otherwise she wouldn t have laid off all of her staff two years before covid.
anita she is still alive lol
here I am in lost ark with every bit of misogynistic pride everexcited for project eve on ps as the protagonist looks fit af
she didn t play games for her videos  she stole footage from other youtubers.
bayonetta. tifa lockhart  old character though . shionne.. all japanese characters lol
@dying rose  I said  for the most part  for a reason. japan still makes good female characters because they pokies on their park of the big pond are rightfully ignored.
@dying rose  trish and lady would be my prime examples.
youre right. in recent years most female characters seem bland and forgettable.lady dimitrescu is an exception  all the woke characters are trash.
@1234 flux  really  because I was hoping that maybe I was just seeing things or blowing them out of proportion. well  as a wise man once said  everything woke turns to shit.
well depends how you look on it  she definitely influenced and wonthe western aaa studio corporatist market. however  she did not win the japanese and for anyone who s about to say what about  square is practically a western company at this point as is sony. nintendo of america is woke  I dont see many woke things nintendo does that changes core elements of japanese nintendo. metroid dread was made by a spaniard company  but they remained true to form  samus doesnt talk about feelings in hallways  she is a woman of few words and mostly action gameplay. so if anyone has examples beyond word propaganda  Ive not see any gross examples of wokism in nintendo.the indie markets  again where she influenced it those games financially failed on a mass scale. all the high selling indie games contain zero social or work commentary  Im thinking hollow knight  bloodstained  dead cells  blasphemous etc. so  she only really had the affect on over inflated aaa studios which outside of doom and quake  never been a huge fan of  not a fan of watching my games rather than playing them. anita has affect on the last of us 2  how d that work out
she s not wrong. now in ww2 shooters like battlefield and cod we have women soldiers  etc. which is annoying because its not even close to being historically accurate  which is what I tend to care about in some shooters. battlefield is especially disappointing because they tended to be more accurate than cod.
my enemy anita
10 19 that guy is on to something about Godzilla vs. kong.  the original was bad. the recent one is  very....meh.  melonie....the best Godzilla movies of all time are Godzilla  king of the monsters and the 90s film Godzilla vs. destroyah.  the closing minutes of the latter was very emotional to most g-man films.  why I loved kotm so much is because of how it paid tribute to so many past films. most viewers aren t aware of this but real g film fans know what Im talking about.
melonie well look at the independent game companies like hell let loose   six days of fallujah   arma 3   squad   farm 51 ww3   insurgency sandstorm those games are fun as hell there s no social justice messages in those games . Im looking forward for the hell let loose new update will be fun I enjoy military shooters thats just me . melonie you should try out insurgency sandstorm if you enjoy mil-sims you ll like it yeahyeyeyeye !
she was successful at ripping a lot of people off. the shift across all hobbies wasn t due to her  but a progressive wave. she didn t deliver on her promise  didn t deliver on her game  and just wasted people s time. useless.edit  Godzilla sucks. all hail gigan.
in my fantasy escapism about fist fighting dragons  I dont want to see ugly fat average men or women for like 40 hours at a time. why is this hard to understand
uh  yeah  good job  I hate games and dont watch movies anymore. great work anita.
I remember when there was a priority shift and everyone went from supporting sargon carl to ridiculing him for his feud with anita. you know  back when he was primarily just a disgruntled dude who wanted to play his videogames before he had a family and a personal business. people shat on him like arguing against anita s nonsense was an indictment against him.but look at the landscape of not just games  but movies and comics. anita won. third wave feminism and  by extension  social justice politics overtook it all. everyone became hyper concerned with being  politically correct  and it tore everything else around it down. she got her wish. and itsucks.Imiss when female characters were actually strong and not just human soapboxes for someone s ideology  or worse  made rude and spiteful because their idea of  strong  is someone being as bitchy as they are. jill valentine in the re3 remake is a perfect example of this. visually she looks fine  but they clearly toned her down. personality wise  they gutted her of every emotion that isn t sarcasm and anger. she lacks fear  compassion  joy  any of those things. more importantly  she doesnt earn her bravado or overcome. she s bland. same with lara croft  or how about last of us 2  this shit doesnt work. who cares if female characters were feminine. its literally synonymous with their sex. but no  now we just need a bunch of butch  joyless fuckers with no prospects other that how annoyed they can look during any given situation.
the only real solution is for people to learn to keep an eye out for these kind of idologically obessed weirdos in the future. I personally think that the rot is so deep  the majority of aaa gaming industry is a lost cause at this point. the best thing is to just start supporting new up and coming studios who believe in creative expression and freedom instead of censorship and moral gatekeeping for the sake of politics
I never understood anita s goal. she did not like how mario had to save a damsel in distress because its stereotypical or something  and she does not like busty or conventionally attractive female characters cause its sexist and unethical or something  I really dont understand the woke agenda. there are attractive males and females in games.
funny thing about the first kong and  zilla  they shot two endings for it. in the us version  kong won and in the japanese version  Godzilla did. a bit of a miscalculation on their part  because it turned out the japanese ending was much more popular with both audiences.
that peach pic in the overhauls looks so dumb xd I cant get over that haha
this is why I dont buy any triple a games anymore they are not worth it
Im on the fence on whether or not resetera and fraudfrequency won  and here s why -- no one actually tracked if the game sales are higher now.  games cost more  partially because of inflation scale.  but I argue that most games are given away at-cost  or at a loss   given how little games sell at msrp.  this wasn t the same a decade ago  given that many games sold at msrp with greater enthusiasm before.  game companies were much stronger before  and were quite iconic in their financial standings.  today   they re wilting.  partially  because of folks rejecting paying full price for what are today s spoodfed bullshit  disguised as pixels  voxels and polygons.the same applies to comics  music  movies  etc.
notice that female characters have to only look practical. take the new tomb raider how lara could man-handle and kill much larger men still by the dozens ... just a curious thing to me.
anita is a killjoy who feels threatened by any fictional heroine more attractive than her. all the talk in her videos about  fighting fuck-toys    lingerie is not armor  and the like is nothing but sour grapes. if she was really concerned about women s representation  she d be praising characters like terra branford  final fantasy 6   alis landale  phantasy star   jill valentine  resident evil  sun shangxiang  dynasty warriors  pronounced  soon shang-shee-ahng   and the numerous other characters who dont fit the  damsel in distress  trope and manage to be beautiful and strong at the same time. tropes vs women was not about equal representation  it was about eliminating the competition  snow white style  because all people like anita see in these female characters is their own flaws. and lo and behold  western games have made their female characters bland and uninteresting just to cater to the sensibilities of anita and her ilk.
best of luck infected_chris!
lol. she thinks they have won  but the aaa gaming industry is in a death spiral. studios are merging and buying each other out left and right. games are seeing the worst sales and reviews of their franchises history. they may be staying afloat on normies still for now but they cannot keep it up forever. game creation tools are getting easier and easier to use. cryengine and unreal engine both can use visual scripting  which avoids much of the hard coding work of making a game  not sure if others have this too. but the point is. indie games are blowing up in popularity and  only getting easier to make. one of these days one of the main genres is going to fall to an indie title and that will signal the beginning of the well-deserved end.
anita  no amount of make up can mask an ugly heart.
nintendo of america s social media went away for a whole week because of the george floyd stuff.
@backup368  ok  is that not marketing  did that go into breath of the wild  metroid dread  super mario maker 2  kirby s star allies  super smash bros no. it didn t. what else you got
@Im a friend of sarah connor  they made a marketing decision to no benefit of their consumers.
@backup368  ok. let me be clear  I do not use twitter or any social media. I simply play their games from 1989-today. thatsaid  Ive not seen anything woke within their games. floyd virtue signaling on social media by nintendo of america  doesnt affect me. can you provide an example of wokism within the games
@Im a friend of sarah connor  the pokemon company donating  1 000 000 to black lives matter.
@backup368  pokemon aside from smash brothers was never my thing  but near all nintendo properties are. now  its my understanding that pokemon is not a straight nintendo company like mario or zelda. why not have mario give blm that money and Im asking this a 3rd time  what example do you have of nintendo inserting woke propaganda into the game as in gameplay  I still dont see it. microsoft and sony  oh God yes. nintendo  not seeing it.
@Im a friend of sarah connor   pokemon doesnt count because I dont play it . nice rebuttal.
@backup368  no  that wasn t a rebuttal sir. that was just  I dont play it. I wasn t aware we were engaged in argument at all. now  Im asking a 4th time  what example of wokism propaganda within game  a videogame to nintendo either developed or published.again  as far as I know which is likely incorrect  nintendo does not own pokemon 100  as they do metroid  zelda and mario. mario is their signature property  you see super mario you think nintendo. my question is why didn t nintendo use super mario to launder  100m now Im gonna go ahead and ask a 5th time just to have my ass covered here  what example do you have of wokism propaganda in a nintendo videogame
@backup368  the pok mon company            kabushikI gaisha pok mon  is a japanese company responsible for brand management  production  publishing  marketing and licensing of the pok mon franchise  which consists of video game software  a trading card game  anime television series  films  manga  home entertainment products  merchandise  and other ventures. it was established through a joint investment by the three businesses holding the copyright of pok mon  nintendo  game freak  and creatures.so  nintendo has 1 3 shares in pokemon company  again  pokemon isn t super mario  the legend of zelda or metroid.now 6th time the charm  do you have any example whatsoever of nintendo using wokism propaganda in their games  still coming up short  I cant think of anything  can you
@Im a friend of sarah connor  why does it have to be in the game  the company as a whole has made it clear where their allegiance lies  just like disney. they dont need wokism in their product  they just have to make tweets to state they support gender studies at early childhood.
@backup368  because thats what w videogame is  its a thing you play. I dont know what else nintendo does beyond console and games. I stand by what Ive said  Ive asked you over 5  if its in any nintendo games and yourefuse to answer. you ve already snarked off  yet you cant or wont answer the most baseline question  7th time bullseye  is their games riddled with woke propaganda  Im gonna answer  to my knowledge  no. Ive not seen any of that in the games  I can give a damn what noa says on twitter  especially when nintendo  japan  as far as I know are one of the last to stay neutral and want white  black  conservative  marxist  white supremacist to buy their games for their kids  nintendo wants both money and the legacy of being one of the best in their field  which they are. thats why it matters  because thats what nintendo does  they make a console and make games for said console. again  Ive not seen any of that in their games and your account will be banned on super mario maker 2 if you make political statements of any kind beyond national flags. I dont find this a surprise since nes  they ve always been sensitive to religion  politics and sex.I didn t think this was arguments with rebuttals  but you want to be a jagoff and not answer the same question 6 times offering me something nintendo of america said on twitter  or pokemon company which has 3 separate companies who own pokemon.8th time  did nintendo put any progressive woke propaganda in their games
@Im a friend of sarah connor  I haven t found any yet  and who cares  what gave you the idea that the company cant be political unless their products have political messages in them  I ll consider nintendo and the pokemon company to not be political when they stop donating money to and sympathizing with criminals and thugs.
@backup368  ok have fun with that  Im still going to keep playing zelda and mario because dude you still did not answer my question. Ive never seen blm propaganda within nintendo games  not one. I can however go through sony when booting up a ps4 5 when they did their little salute for blm  but there again ps had relocated from japan to california. I canthink of numerous games that does have those theme and messaging  near all are made in usa.the japanese simply do not care about this crap and likely viewed it as a tax  no different than if they had a similar deal in china. again  I said in the root of this comment Im well aware of nintendo of america social media virtue signaling  and if thats all nintendo s done I really do not care  I deleted social media years ago because its a waste of time and brain power. pokemon  ok well nintendo has 1 3 stake in pokemon they dont even have a majority stake. I dont play pokemon  this was the first I heard about it and no I dont care  its not super mario  legend of zelda  metroid which nintendo 100  owns. never seen super mario  link and samus say blm! with a commie salute. so no I dont see nintendo committing the same cardinal sin thatsony and microsoft did. nintendo switch has been the only console Ive owned since 2017  I never got a ps4 or xbox 1 etc. doesnt have to do with this  just makes it easier to not buy. if nintendo is cut out  modern videogames are cut out. steam  microsoft  sony  nintendo  thats it. if Im choosing  sticking with nintendo because you ve provided no evidence that nintendo is into the same crap the others are to the extent they are. however I can provide those answers for nintendo s competitors. nintendo of america is woke  but still less woke than its competitors. Im sticking with nintendo  do what you want but when it comes to business  loz botw  super mario odyssey  super mario maker 2  metroid dread are all high quality games that is driven by gameplay  not cutscenes and dialogue. so  Im going to keep buying nintendo games  you go ahead and protest though I guess that means you cant buy anything made past june 2020.the only thing nintendo cares about it their reputation of quality of videogames  and how do we get more nintendo consoles in more homes  which they did with switch. in the past a household would have 1 nes  snes  n64  gamecube  wiI  wiI u  but switch they figured how to get parents to buy 2 for 2 kids per household. that  thats all they care about.
wokeness has destroyed gaming. I dont care about mainstream games anymore  Im only interested now in indie games.
is there any real pushback currently against this moral authoritarian and the other pro-censorship people dominating game development and journalism now  breadtube and other far-left propaganda who defend this moral authoritarian is very popular on places like twitch  youtube etc. the old skeptic community who had the courage to push back against this stuff either went woke or went into equally regressive hard right politics. how can we win and make games great again like in the 90 s and early 00 s
to take this succes as a win just means she s lost.she s like a wendy pan  or a snow-white.. maybe even a tinkerbell.. high priestess of the midgets. queen of the lost boys.
big business did way more damage to gaming than feminism could ever dare hope for. in any case  newer leaner video game companies are still producing great games  I cannot wait for saints row 5.
dont talk about her! she will disappear if you dont mention her
I definitely think this woman ruined a lot of western game devs with her idiotic world view. however  if  win  was getting a bunch of terrible games in the west. then yes  she won. however  all it did for me is make me avoid certain devs completely and mostly play games made in japan these days.
Im wondering what percentage of these woke whiners having fantods over female video game characters actually play the games.btw  chris  youre on my prayer list. take care  God bless.
investors are still waiting for that tropes to be finished
I dont have any issue with women being depicted in a less objectifying way in any medium of entertainment. but if the solution is to make them uninteresting or conduits for political talking points  I dont see that as a  win . as always  the win comes when a character is well-written and well-designed.
huh so being involved with the biggest disapiontment in the last ten years  thats winning to her.
another point I would like to make is the feminist mindset is a poisonous one and designed for a reason. for example  with women like anita  they see beautiful women and their first thought process is  Imust destroy it. this disparages me as a person and thus my value can only go up when their value is lowered . contrast that with males in gaming. the dreaded  male power fantasy  that is characters like doomguy  or even in media like schwarzenegger and stallone in the 70 s and 80s and even the 90s. males back then  male feminists today are not men in my eyes  did not try to  emasculate  those men. we wanted to be those men. we wanted to be better. its hard work  its tough  but the male mentality typically is  that person is better than me. I need to become better than them   instead of  I need to break their legs to be better than them .
I avoid games with female lead protagonists because of this. I will continue to do so and give my money to the japanese  who still know how to enjoy games. many of these woke companies will go the way of the dinosaur.
no she didn t when there are modders out there undoing the mistakes that was made
ah yes... we went from  oh  the main character is female  cool...  to  ffs  I dont need to know the gender identity sexual orientation for every person animal inanimate object especially when it has nothing to do with the story!  yep... feminism is great and totally not a grift at this point...
slowly chipping away at female charcters in japan aswell. or they are just censored.
this will hurt female protagonists so much... I dont even like feel like wasting any money on any female lead game or movie. well done  feminism!
all the likes of anita sarkeesian and neil druckmann has done with their grifting is pushed me more toward japanese gaming content. I rarely buy any aaa western release nowadays and have never been happier  -
its pretty funny how people like platinum games came female characters sexy and badass and still kick ass
this is why we must gatekeep our hobbies. these grifters are in for their 15 minutes and 50k. anita and those like her  forget   not just the best female characters in gaming   but the best characters in gaming period. samus   zelda  peach   lara  tifa  aeris  rayne  jill  claire. the list goes on. figures this is the same garbage thinking that tried to tell us sarah connor   elen ripely  red sonja again long list were figments of our imagination.
melonie what s your oppion on the 90s tomb raider comics
thats a good question. sadly the people most likely to watch content like this fell down the hard right path themselves  instead of staying based  read  centrist. the political horseshoe has been a disaster for creative freedom.
what I dont understand is there is a whole community of girls who love to cosplay these sexy female characters in games and anime with  unrealistic proportions.  its funny how the progressive stance is now  women oughta cover up
see  this is why we should ve gatekept harder when it comes to gaming. the western gaming industry has become so unbelievably insufferable that all we get now is woke  political garbage.
I think people like her have ruined popular culture in general.
like many have said and I ll reiterate in my own words.  Ive been playing games since the atarI 2600 back when I was 5 years old.  and in all that time Ive never seen female characters be as boring  bland and forgetable as the number of bland boring female characters in games today.
anita! get back under your rock!!!
we can never allow feminism to win!!!go go boomers!!!!
as a pc gamer  Im glad mods exist to  correct  this unfortunate feminist view of what women should look like.  some women in gaming are looking better than ever to me!  in fact  Im having some trouble focusing on the game...
she did what jack thompson failed to do.
she complains that there are no minorities in gaming.japanese fighting game has a native indian fighter from the 90s.atlus doesnt want to remake remaster it due to fears of racism.congratulations  your progression caused even more minorities in gaming to never be represented for the accusation of giving them exposure could cause false accusation of racism to the game developer.
she did win she damaged the games industry I think she would be referred to as a grifter right.
being gen z  this is the only time I appreciate being called a  boomer .
why big aaa developers took her influence I ll never know. the women in modern games are annoying and bland and I appreciate the talk about healing and healing from tribulations at the end  it does take it my mind back to the big picture after talking about frustrating media culture stuff  3
the beast is real people! many of you thought she was only a tale to scare new gaming youtubers. she is very real.
almighty and eternal God you are the everlasting health of those who believe in you.hear us for your sick servant chrisfor whom we implore the aid of your tender mercy that being restored to bodily health he may give thanks to you in your church.through Christ our Lord.
did she finish paying her former female staff
so many real things to be worried about in life  but this woman s main goal is winning at feminism in gaming....thats sad.
the industry has succeed despite the interference from people like anita sarkeesian.  I would love anita to show any objective proof thatsubstantiates her claims about positively affecting the gaming industry.  please show me some evidence that her ramblings has somehow increased end user sales  and not simply added costs to game developers  who now have to fill job positions thatstrictly focus on censoring the creative idea s of the actual artists  musicians  writers  etc.
if ever you find yourself agreeing with anything anita sarkeesian thinks  stop and reassess. youre about to go down a very frosky path. spoiler  there s a pile of shit at the end.
anita did win. she is directly responsible for being the wedge that opened the door to all our problems now. androgynous looking women is now a staple of american gaming.
anita sarkeesian is still around
100
Imean thats not why they didnt want to remake it... thats just yellowflash and a twitter user account thats run by 1 guy tweeting out that atlus were not doing it because of  cultural appropriation  like you forget some of the characters that are in street fighter and tekken... like come on. they didnt remake power instinct because it wasn t profitable... if they were that bothered they would have just removed white buffalo... but the game really was not popular when it came out and is basically irrelevant now.
Jesus was the logos of the universe inbodied in a human meaning how he was is the core of the universe compassion and love but to also be truthfull and responsable  he came here to teach us what we can do to live in peace and love but he was also here to show us truth that if you dont live in compassion that it wil be youre downfall he went to the cross to show us to take responsability for youre actions and to show that death is nothing to be feared that its just the next journey.him on the cross was him saying am taking responsability and to show that without fear no1 has controle over you if you fear then that fear controls you so you better learn to overcome it before it overcomes you.
oh yeah  the bastian of female representation - the game she was credited as a consultant for  the last of us pt iI  had a woman with a very masculine build beating up two very feminine lesbians  one of them pregnant  on screen and enjoying it.oh no  women cant be feminine in games  thats sexist  they have to be masculine and beat down feminine women. but sarkeesian herself isn t a body builder or take male hormones to change her appearance  does she  no  she s always wearing make up  earrings  lipstick  long hair  always presenting herself in a very traditionally feminine fashion.her whole career screams of hypocrisy!
she didn t win. game devs went woke. but Ive seen the trend wearing off lately.
most tripple-a games are bland  unimaginative  afraid and utterly uninteresting  so  sarkeesian might be right. maby feminism did win after all.
thunderfoot did some of the best videos debunking anita sarkeesian
Im playing through horizon forbidden west right now. aloy is such a fucking boring character. she s been slightly improved since zero dawn but holy shitshe s just a stale cardboard cutout of someone. zero personality. Im 45 hours in and Im struggling to continue now just because of how boring she is to play as. there is zero complexity to her as a character. its so surface level. anita has ruined what devs can do with women leads. they have to play itso safe and boring. they should be ashamed  not celebrated. I cant wait for the pendulum to start coming back and we can have women in games again that are actually memorable.
the sad truth is  anita isn t wrong  she did win. so many people have no idea she helped write the story of the last of us part iI  which is why she was so damn cocky tweeting at cd project red  thatshe can help them write the story for more inclusivity  which was met with a hard stone cold  no . remember when she visited bioware  wouldn t be surprised if she had something to do with mass effect andromeda at this point  my point is  she s impacted the gaming industry than people think  her crusade was a success and and omen to us all.
she doesnt even play video games
I just want to say that anita does not have a clue bout what she is talking bout and she needs to stop before she gets her butt kicked and kicked off the social media site for saying something that other people got mad at of her saying something that is not true and false  ok melonie. anyway I just want to say and make a comment bout this topic  ok melonie. anyway I hope you understand what I am saying to you on this comment  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful   great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night melonie.
everything thing woke turns to shit- a wise man said that
the old lara croft was the best.  I know she is not realistic but cmon its a game  she is strong  cool and also beautiful sexy. but I guess we cant have sexy girls in games anymore because of equality  !! lmao
I cant believe what I been hearing
oh  anita sarkeesian.. reminds me of the good old youtube days with alphaomegasin.
feminist  video games focus on female .me  have you never seen gay service game
do I remember when that happened
now we get patato female characters that look like men.
makes a desert and calls it  peace .
I didnt know there was a war  specially since in 1986 samus aran was a female lead on a nintendo game worldwide.
thank God that anita sarkeesian never found out about comic books  she would have destroyed power girl  she-hulk  starfire  black widow  bat-girl  black canary  and many more strong independent women.
03 12  dude... has she played metal gear revengeance  melonie  she s been caught on video stating she s not a fan of video games.
yeah he did good stuffbefore he went nuts with trump victory.
looking forward to a bloodrayne remake so we can have a start to get things rolling.
there wasnt a war - anita sarkesian baited a load of trolls on reddit to attack to her to make people who didnt care about gaming believe that gaming was a toxic environment thatspecifically targeted and hated women. it worked. a lot of video game companies changed how they do things to fall more in line with this  mythic  ideology.its been blown way out of proportion by both sets of extremists.
I thought she died. lol  because. I haven t heard  anything from her. lok xd I guess she on prowl
at least we will have nier automata  2b is awesome.
also king kong was curb stomped in the new one he totally 100  lost the fight.
commenting to feed the algorithm
yeap  she won.  no joking  no sarcasm  no pithy comment  she and her ilk has effectively ruined gaming and most entertainment.  and all because we geeks and nerds  now called incels  didn t want to gatekeep the normies  the real bullies out  because we want girls and friends to like what we do.  instead  she did what all puritanical evangelists do  infest  corrupt  destroy.  thanks anita.
Im team Godzilla as well.
feminism has won  is the funniest statement  everybody knows  it takes a man to win in woman s division.world best female tennis play was beaten by number 500 male... while he was drunk!world best female soccer team team was beaten by a random high school male team.just because they have gotten a free-pass  they all of a sudden think  they are the best . its children who doesnt know better
more human  itseems they are all the same type of woman
pure evil..
Im sad now
playing lost ark on pc the last couple weeks. I dont think it has.
the only way she wins is if we talk about her. she s stayed irrelevant for quite some time  so let s not give her more attention.
if the only game I saw was horizon forbidden west  id say she is right.
meryl silverburgh. also  who is anita!
it has destroyed gaming
haven t miss a video  comment or like yet
anita doesnt play video games.
or samus n melonie I played with an female gamer last night on my mmo she spazzed on me
I dont really are anymore though. I rarely even play  new  aaa games anywaymost of the fun game was from 5  years ago  some of the new games also fun  but its not even made by western dev
when corporate drama ruins something  Imove. star wars corporate drama made me move to battletech franchise.  on tabletop no one can ban you  and for tabletop rpg mechwarrior destiny  from battletech  we control content on our table.  anita did not win. she just made people move to other equally cool entertainment.  I am not spending a dime on star wars. my money goes to battletech.  I used to play videogames  now I play tabletop.  battletech tabletop is very simulationist. but on my table I have no compatibility issues  no bans  no corporate drama.
these people who push their ideology into entertainment.this is the reason why I cant get into the industry because if I openly say I love japanese games  people will accuse me of the most horrible things.they can have the industry  let it crash and whoever picks up the pieces  they will gatekeep these nuts out of it.
we won . sounds like cope to me
yeah I dont understand why they want to degenderise women. what a way to give women more of an identity by trying to make them more like men. I feel like we should be celebrating what makes us all different  and appreciate the gifts God gave us.
meh.  they won . which is why the modding community is so popular. reverting all the changes or redoing stylistic choices forced on the community by the developers.
anita still exist
I think politics should stay out of entertainment period because at the end of the day 98  of the time the people trying to throw politics into entertainment fail to see what whoever is enjoying said entertainment actually thinks
amen
feminism has won shoots myself
amen
anita needs to go  and stay gone. she s an absolute scam artist.
team Godzilla!
she lyin again  though. lol
perfect  can she stop the crusade now
she  won   maybe  but look at the hatred and tropes she created as a result.
just lots of haters out there trying to capitalize on the pain of others. some of them are twisted in the head. fuck em.
she sounds as a right hoot. she must be single.
prayer is good
melonie I have to say it antia sarkeeian didn t change the industry she destroyed it and she needs to be gatekept out of the replacement
go boom
saying goes  even if you aren t interested in politics  politics is still interested in you. and that interest creates the danger. dont budge an inch to grifters unless you want to lose what you love.
yeah its sad we dont have games like lollipop chainsaw  classic tomb raider  or wet anymore those had cool female characters and wasn t woke.
she doesnt win a damn thing  got that
sadly she s kinda right.  look at the redesigned of mortal kombat females and the dark queen in battletoads.  but the people who want thatshit dont even play or care about video games.
why are non gamers messing with gamers  we were a happy lot playing our games. escaping the screwed up world. enjoying our fun our teammates. our fav games fav characters
if you have a brain cancer  is it even worth going through treatment  Imean  what are the odds
Lordkat was right anita the liar lost
interesting fact  according to a resent poll 54  of the women asked had  good looks  as the main reason for choosing a male  wealth was the second closest option . so women objectify men just as much but just arnt hournest about it
look up the Godzilla pinball machine from 2021 or 2020 im not sure what year exactly but the new one
day 23 of commenting on your videos until g fuel sponsors me. I wish everyone would just buy what they like and ignore what they dont... you know... like adults.
modern feminism much like  wokeness turns everything it touches to .
to be a prize means you have much value  if  they portrating woman as prizes that means they say woman are somethint to fight and die for. like the troope of the king sayng to anyone that  kills the dragon I would give the hand of my beloved daugther in marriage aka the woman is worth  you to risk your life for in a very ery dangerous task that the average man normaly wont do it becasue if any avere joe could kill the dragon the king would simply  send 2 or 3  commun soldiers to do it..
stop paying money for games which do changes  even small ones. if a game dresses up a sexy character dont say you dont care! dont give them any of your fingers at all  or they will take your hand. also ingame stores!
why I only do nintendo. one of the few companies who wont listen to her. she really hates nintendo.
feminism certainly hasn t hurt the video game porn industry.
well to be honest games back around 2012 till 2016 were highly sexualised for female characters and thats what sold the games  now the games are boring because the  games have changed a lot now as a result of the industry having to change which is a shame !!!
guli!
we all know it hasn t won yet. it never has won and never will. because if it has won  why the heck does itstill continue to complain
her mistake is thinking culture ends with her. give it 10 years and we will laugh.also  nothing has changed that much.
great! the rest of us will take the l as long as sarkeesian shuts up and goes away
that only reason why we put up with anita is because she is just a little kitten with a big mouth. she couldn t harm anyone if she tried.
at least we have metroid
a lot of it has to do with the age of the patient and type of brain cancer  there s actually many different kinds. with treatments  survival rates for an adult patient under 44 can be as high as 92  to as low as 22   depending on the type of brain cancer and the stage.
wait  I thought we were laughing at her already!
when did she talk about minorities my light skin black back side dont remember that I could have made a video on it and became e famous.
games have been trash for years now and anita is what caused it all.
you know who likes hot women in games  women!
I hope sarkeesian will lose in the long run
men will simply move on to other games   or activities that have few women. its the only thing we can do these days. feminism may as well be woke   we know what happens to everything woke.
if feminism has won in gaming then it really shows how toxic feminism is.
well id software and from software are companies who refuse to bend the knee to politics and stupid nonsense and people like anita and in fact doom eternal basically made fun that entire culture of politics and views in the storyline if you pay attention and read between the lines. so we haven t lost as long as there are still good companies making good games to be enjoyable and not be centered around politics we re still in the game.she wont win in the end because push back is to strong against it and its growing. even if gaming companies agree with her that doesnt mean anything if the stuff they put out doesnt make them money ultimately they are at the mercy of the o mighty dollar which is controlled by the customer.if gamers dont want to buy the woke garbage they call their games we wont and when they start losing money and its hurting their bottom line they ll change their tune they always do because at the end of the day they dont care about politics they care about money.

Imean who plays triple a games anyways thats from the west they all are so rail roaded and dumbed down that its basically walking simulators.
does feminism has won in gaming    Im not sure of that   to be honest I dont even understand what its suppose to mean
the idea to make a woman character go from where we where to where we are now I e stick figures almost. its a greek tragedy man. yall ladies need to stand tf out and stick to chest out and makes some demands.
melonie have you heard of sargon of akkad you will like him
well they had to get a win in somewhere. because feminism sure didn t get a win in women s sports.
anyone who thinks that king kong could defeat Godzilla  just imagine a gorilla figthing a crocodile and use your brain to think who would win... spoiler alert  a crocodile would fuck a gorilla up...
what zodiac sign are you
if she think not having a good loveable female characters is a win then sure. but I dont see how well that going to go every game anita had her finger in has turn into absolute crap. anyone remember the main character in battlefront 2 of course not she was bland and boring and she was reason why no one care about the campaign in that game.
shin g jira
anita sarkisian is not an icon nor a feminist in my opinion cause they are so many awesome female influences like amy henning and mica burton in the gaming industry as well as laura bailey.  her ideology of feminism is to make be  ashamed of their femininity and that is not cool!
... who
we have won! women look more like men in games   yay!  s
as much as I love their games  I dont if I can say that from software didn t bend the knee. they had body type a and b in elden ring and demon s souls remake instead of male and female body types.
feminism...  ... no longer means what it used to. now we have these...  people ... like sarkeesian. she s a snake and deserves every ounce of negative feedback and backlash she gets. honestly  I hate her with every fiber of my being. her bs politics do not belong anywhere near gaming.would love to see her receive a swift backhand of karma. she is responaible for ruining many games. wouldn t piss on her if she was on fire.
Ive seen a lot of the her terrible videos  and she knows next to nothing about videogames.
since then aparentely noone knows what a woman means...   so win   sure
I am indeed a boomer.is thatsarkeesian woman trying to be relevant again
eh  who cares what anita deludes herself into thinking
what about brand theft auto is thatstill being sold talk about women being ornaments and trophies thats one good game
feminism won and now gaming is in the worst place its ever been  with a few exceptions. great success!
heres your prize anita  millions of dusty unsold copies of last of us 2. congrats.
same chick thatset up a indiegogo or the like for a discord right  I forget as I forget this chick was a thing and around.all this money and not really much to show for it  really odd.....
lol yeah in the same way feminism has won in movies and media. what does the word  won  mean again
and turned it to shit.
the feminist won  the game companies  the gamers  the retails and everyone who has some actual interest on video games lost. personally I am skipping all the feminist generation  I am playing old games  that are uncensored  until they start making good games again. those old games are better than the new ones anyways.
playing the last of us 2...  wtf       everything in this post-apocalypse world is woke. and sarkeesion was apparantly an influence on this game ...  and itshows..  all sarkeesion did was make video games boring and obsessed with identity politics..  and gamers were the losers..
if video games go full woke with sjw garbage I ll throw my games in the trash and take up bird watching. you fuck with the stuff I like I ll take my money elsewhere.
one doesnt do well due to gender. one does well because one does well. stop tap dancing.
Godzilla beat kong  mecha beat Godzilla  kong beat mecha.
if you take legend of zelda  who has most power link or zelda    how many people have thinked that the little elf s name was zelda   link is the h ro and for many year he was anonymous what a glory!.   after that  link have a big sword  yeah  he risk his life for what    to permit to zelda to keep her crown !  who had a priviledge here     link is a poor guy  awaken by zelda  or harass by the peter pan s pixie  and he have to risk his life to save rich people.   and its barely the same thing with peach and mario s brother
to an extent it has. and itsucks. its infested entertainment overall like the aids virus.
leave it to sarlaac pit to claim that  feminism won   while simultaneously still playing the victim card. can youreally take the word of a grifter from a channel with over 2 million subs  but can barely get over 1k views for any of her videos
the fact she had an impact on the industry shows that people need to care more what people like her think.
@benice108  anything anita touches  even peripherally  I avoid.  the gaming industry  much like comics  is starting to visibly separate between east and west gaming... and indies...
@blank adams  I ll admit l ve got to start paying more attention to exactly who is working on what  in games and film. I hope their bad takes go bankrupt sooner than later as we start seeing more contrasts between quality and activism.
@joseph falardeau sarkeesian also lies about zelda in one of her videos. she claims that zelda has never been the star in any  of her own games. not just the core franchise but in any of them. even though zelda is the star in two games released in the 1990s on the philips cd-I console.
melonie mac talking about that woke anita sarkeesian  time to get the popcorn  she talking about women s butt s in games when solid snake is the one who is literally famous for being dummy thicc
all media has gone woke and become unsexy. most movies tv show  games have ugly female characters. this is why I pretty much only watch anime and shows from 2000 and older.
9  had women leads  yeah because the others have robots  or you can make your own character  or they dont have a fucking story lead at all! oh shit  asteroids lead is not female  its a spaceship ! sexist!
Im surprised that youre an adherent to a sexually repressive religion while disagreeing with anita.anita s mission to censor female sexuality is actually consistent with the abrahamic religions  purity culture.consider the following verse    if your right eye causes you to sin  pluck it out and cast it from you  for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish  than for your whole body to be cast into hell. and if your right hand causes you to sin  cut it off and cast it from you  for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish  than for your whole body to be cast into hell   verses 29-30 .
you should watch one of my earlier uploads about the subject of modesty  etc. sounds like you dont understand what the Bible itself says on the topic. lara croft being curvy and me liking her character is not sinning or lusting lol
@melonie mac go boom  searching modesty on your channel produces no results. what the Bible says about modesty is consistent with anita s criticisms of some female portrayals in games. for example  games like bmx xxx  duke nukem and dead or alive xtreme beach volleyball are the kind that anita protests which also violates the Bible s modesty doctrine.lara herself was marketed seductively in gaming magazines. my assumption is that anita s goal is to eliminate the catalysts for sexual harassment from our culture  the biggest being the sexualization of women in media.
