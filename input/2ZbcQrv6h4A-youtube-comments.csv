I literally didn t even believe this was him at first look.... holy sheiza! I saw this man as role model when he was in the sherlock films. his body was fit and his mind was sharp  on and off screen. this.... this is just heart breaking
melonie is the type who genuinely motivates you to become a better person.
hey melonie  I noticed you saying  I hope this verse helps someone   in a few of your videos  and I wanted to say  it always does! just by reading the verse of the day and preaching on it youre being a witness on this platform and  not only that  youre encouraging other believers to be witnesses as well. also  beyond that  you always do a great job of applying the verses youread to our lives and giving us examples of how they ve applied to yours.
I actually have a hard time keeping weight on. my husband who s a doctor got me into a dietitian he knows and she set me up on a balanced diet involving a balanced diet of meats  veggies  carbohydrates and finally for a 6 2  woman I look healthy for a change. was able to finally put on the weight I needed to turn it into muscle.
just look at dr oz when he went vegan he looked like death warmed over while trying to tell you how healthy he felt mind you that was a 28 day plan he did lol funny how he created a 28 day plan to sell and then went back to eating normally
I just want to say  thanks melonie for actually keeping it real and just speaking your mind. feels like everyone these days just hops on the groupthink and cant actually make any solid logical arguments from their own perspectives. love the content  keep it up!
its almost like humans are omnivorous for a reason lol
Im getting back on the carnivore diet. I d done it a couple years ago  after struggling with obesity for almost 40 years. without changing my regular workout at all  I lost 40lbs  stopped snoring  eliminated my chronic  bleeding gums  when brushing my teeth  ended my  restless limb  syndrome  and got out of a depressive funk that I d been in for years. incredible changes. what surprised me the most  I didn t get hungry  and I didn t get cravings. for years  it was the midnight munchies thatsent me running to 7-eleven for  steam-tray roller food.  my life hitsome rough patches a couple years later  financially and emotionally  and I got back into bad habits. but Im back  Im loving it  and seeing fast results again! I got your back on this one  melonie mac. boom!
its so sad to see this happening. I hope he stays safe and also wish him the best. only in 2 years  that is a huge difference. man...
hollywood culture really does chew you up and spit you out.
I like how you cover the topics that interest you instead of whatever is doing the rounds  keep being authentic !!!! go boom !!!!
your hair looks great. the straightened hair looks good  but this natural look seems more...natural.you are a stunning lady and you dont need to change a thing. dont believe anyone who says anything different.
if I didn t know he had gone vegan  I would have thought he had relapsed to the drugs and alcohol of his youth.
you know those conspiracy theories where they say  this celeb was replaced by another person   if someone told me that rdj was replaced by a clone or something  at this point I d believe it.
he looks like he s in his mid 80 s
all the years of my life I have always looked younger than I really am. even at 25  almost 26  I look like Im 20 or so. even since I tried to go more plant based along with added stress from the last few years  I feel like that younger look is drifting away. Im trying to edge myself to a most beef pork chicken with some dairy diet with maybe a single serving of grapes 3 times a week currently so here s hoping I can have my youth looking face back and get out of this 200lb hole Im in. Imiss the days where I was under 140.as for the pastor I have to say... I actually do kind of agree with him  not entirely. there are things I definitely wouldn t do even at the worst of times  but there have been times Ive said I wouldn t do something and weeks  months  or even years later I ended up eating those words. you never truly know until it happens since God is known to test his children and sometimes even provoke a test simply because he chose to like what happened to job. and this is even with good things! like I never thought in a million years I d fly in a plane and at Christmas 2021  I did just that with my own money. it was a surreal experience.
best thing I ever did was going keto. Im fit and strong. I put men half my age to shame. somehow my grocery bill went down. I only eat two meals a day yet Im never hungry. and my food is delicious. I just had my first meal today  at 4pm  and it was 100g of roast pork  50g of cheese  3 desert spoons of natural greek yogurt and two eggs. and I had to add a slab of butter to the eggs to make sure I got enough calories for the day.
big thanks to you. I switched to carnivore keto diet.  its awesome. getting in better shape. did find out the hard way   you weren t kidding when you said if you slip up you feel like crap.
loving you melonie!  _  I first saw you on the drinker s channel and while listening to you thought   I need to tune in over there too . been catching up on your videos all day and loving every second of it! keep that voice strong!oh my gosh  that downey picture makes me think of the cast of alone. more often than not  they just cant prepare fast enough for winter and starve like that. not healthy! veganism is just another eating disorder thats more easily condoned. I love the show alone  and learned a lot from them  but I feel for the participants.
so I had been in a bad time in my life and got to almost 300lbs  im 6 2  ...prior to this in my younger days I was an athlete  power lifter and body builder. so I had watched the  fat  sick and nearly dead  movie and decided to try it...and I guess you could say it worked. I went from 296 to 185lbs in about 8 months...buuuuut. I had lost all of my muscle  my testosterone level went into the dirt  my estrogen and progesterone went sky high and I became an emotional mess  like completely psycho   felt super weak all the time  etc... so I bailed. went back to keto which had always worked for me in the past. me and carbs just dont get along...so keto allows me to retain muscle mass  get shredded when I want too  and helps keep my hormones in check. not saying it works for everyone...it just has always worked really well for me.
so you eat your meat and fish raw right  without cleaning anything  straight from nature  without any weapons tools
@victor soares  yeah bro I live in the forests of alaska and hunt with my wolf pack  raw deer is the best!
@duskwalker68  sure you do
@victor soares  how dare you doubt me! I ll have you know that Ive spent the last fourty years out here and not only that  I am also the proud father of a half man half wolf homunculus.
@victor soares  not really a good argument. you do realize you have to cook plenty of vegetables to safely consume them  right  potatoes  broccolI  cauliflower  etc.
@david cook  you mean water them omg such a complicated feature  I can eat berries and other fruits without cleaning themps its funny that you only pick that one part of my argument .... because you know you cant debate the rest  you cantry tho
@victor soares  no genius  you have to cook them because they have something in them that affects how well you absorb iodine. unless your diet consists of nuts  berries  and mostly fruit you dont really have an argument. most foods require prep.
humans are obligate carnivores
@victor soares  enjoy your supplements
@assassin 9958  u dont have to tell him  that.
@victor soares  what does this have to do with anything  you can and do eat raw fish and beef lol.
why is this sad  you dont even know if he feels good or not youre making an asumption yet you know nothing of the situation go ask robert of he feels good dont just feel bad because a you tuber says he looks bad.
@the veggster good day  its sad to me because whether or not we know if he feels good or not  he looks a lot older in just two years. he doesnt look bad just to the youtuber  he looks bad to me too. also  I ll feel however I want to feel based on my observations  lol.
its not two years  its a fourteen year difference. she s just a liar
@toothless  rapidly aging 14 years in about the space of two--sounds about right for these more extreme types of diets.
@lotus petal  the two photos were taken 13 years apart.
@el marto  but he stated on twitter just in 2020 that he was going vegan. he hasn t been vegan for 14 years.
it  s a 14 years old picture..
@nicky larson  did he look like this in avengers  endgame about four years ago  that must be some heavy cgI they used for him if it is.
@lotus petal  you are still not ashamed of your lies  you said 2 instead of 14.
@nicky larson  yes  because Imeant 2 years. did you even watch the video
he looked healthier on the drugs lol
@plagueinjected  he s 57 years old and abused drugs for years when he was much younger. its not weird for someone approaching their 60 s to not have as much muscle - especially given how much abuse their body has endured from drugs in the past.
oh like the one with whatshername  avaril
its literally 12 yrs apart
@benny pika  umm yeah..my labs say otherwise
I remember brian shaw   4x wsm   was asked if he knew any competitive vegan strongmen  he said no.  thatshould tell you something.
oh my goodness  rdj looks so different ! ironically  this video came out while Im getting ready to switch over to strict keto and have learned so much between organic and process food  but also how important fats and meats are for our body compared to carbs!
didnt realize you were carnivore. just started a month ago and I to have been very satisfied with the results. my body actually reacts negatively when I reintroduce gluten or carb heavy foods.
you also have to remember that a good bit of his appearance is  most likely  just his age catching up with him. speaking as a guy who just hit 52 and has been very strong and durable my whole life  you do start to notice things going downhill around the time you hit 50.
helps a lot  please dont stop doing what you do. I love you so much.
my best friend is training for police academy  and makes me work out with him on the weekend.  his skin  physique  and overall bulk was clearly different after he went keto carnivore  and Im not far behind him.
in order for veganism to work you would have to grow literally everything I imagine and I came across a guy on yt who managed not look like death and is full on vegan. if you search  200  fruit trees phoenix  into the yt search you ll see a guy who was growing everything himself for years. I only came across him since I wanted to start growing some stuff and since we live in the same climate I wanted to see how he pulls it off.
well he s also getting older but yeah someone get this man the whole cow
rdj losing weight is concerning. older people sometimes have medical issues that can make holding weight difficult and doing specific types of exercise risky sometimes  though.  heart conditions  immune disorders  etc.  on Bible verses  habakkuk is a good story for these sorts of times if you d like to check it out.keep being awesome.
dont forget  robert downey jr. used to be an actual drug addict  and even then he didn t look this bad.
remember how skinny robert downey jr. looked in the beginning of avengers endgame  um  yeah. if I see him  Im buying him a large pizza.I appreciate you  melonie.  d
I remember seeing billy bob thorton come out on a late night show  when people used to watch those  and he was a recent vegan   shockingly emaciated. I need to look into seed oils
I dont think its entirely fair to compare robert to dr. baker. regardless of diet its clear one of these men is working quite hard to maintain a certain physique while one is certainly not.  that all being said  if you showed me those two before and after pictures out of context of his diet  I would assume he had cancer or aids.
I have actually been interested in getting into your diet and not just for some fad but as a change in my life. are there any sources that have recipes you can recommend I am by no means picky and I usually enjoy just about anything and sometimes I am resourceful to make something from good to better.
he s skinnier  but he s also older  not wearing makeup and doesnt seem to have hollywood drugs in his body. I hope he s healthy and okay. I think its the glasses  t-shirt and hat making him look a little less manly.  could be wrong
I had a friend who was a vegan until she collapsed and had to be hospitalized. they told her to eat meat because she was so malnourished. she isn t a vegan anymore  thank goodness. but man! that doesnt look like robert downey jr at all. the harry caray glasses dont help him much either. holy cow!
melonie   hair s still drying  hope that doesnt offend anyone! us  nah  we re fine.co-host coltraine  immediately grouches out of the room
I think it is important to understand that the phots of robert in shape were taken from his training for the infinity saga where he was the face of hollywood s biggest franchise. he had to be on screen with Gods and genetically enhanced super humans and seem on par. hollywood is known for putting their stars on enhancing supplements and I feel seeing robert in his mid 50s  well passed the age of muscle development  in that good of a shape goes to show  not to the extent of hemsworth or evans however . coming off this and going vegan he was going to lose a lot of weight as his body adjusts but the fact he is flexing insinuates to me he is happy with where he is. he is 57 and is lean with some muscle to show - if I dont have a pot belly at that age I d be flexing too.
youre awesome  melonie. keep up the excellent work.
rdj is a man pushing 60 who youre used to seeing in make-up through camera filters  if he was working on another action film you probably wouldn t be able to tell the difference between now and two years ago after he spent the time to get back into shape with a personal trainer and workout routine.
I agree to a point  but he dropped really fast even for his age. him going vegan would definitely exacerbate the muscle loss. in a few years he might just become a toothpick.
to be fair  he probably was around college age when he got addict. it hard to look bad when youre in your 20 s
maybe casue he was basically 20  yrs younger then  Imean how can you leave that fact out of the equation
@benny pika  it was before college age.
youre not wrong. its not a fair comparison  but when I go carnivore I trim fat fast and muscle maintenance growth comes far easier with even general exercise.
@remus ventanus  when you eat a vegan diet you still build muscle effectively too  except with a vegan diet you get actually more nutrients that help your body in more ways than just building muscle such as brain development or processing of other nutrients within your body which otherwise would not be possible with those specific nutrients. meat diet only gives you the essentials necessary to be alive  but is unnecessary considering you could just get those same nutrients from a plant based diet by variety in your dishes. only argument I can say one can give fairly against a vegan diet is that it takes more effort to cook  with meat you can eat it pretty much alone and get all you  need  while with plants you have to find the matching foods that complement eachother in order to give you complete proteins
@barbadosl questions why.  I completely disagree with you  but its all good  you do you.
@remus ventanus  you can also go watch earthlinged on youtube  he dedicated his life to having all the answers for switching to vegan. literally any argument you can possibly fathom within yourself he has answered in one video or another including made a tedtalk about it. its not just morally a better decision to move away from meat but also is physically superior and even helps save the planet from global environmental destruction in so many ways.
@barbadosl questions why.  lol. I said its okay we disagree. youre welcome to youtube dr. ken berry if youre curious why Im carnivore. cheers! take care!
@barbadosl questions why.  Im not interested  but good luck with everything!
@remus ventanus  if you arent interested in informing yourself then you should refrain from ever making a statement on something you know nothing about.
@barbadosl questions why.  look. Ive avoided debating you because neither of us are going to change our positions  so there is no point. Im not interested because I found something that has worked amazing for me and the results have changed my life dramatically. youre attempting to change my mind on something Ive already had incredible success with and its just not going to happen. im in my 30s and feel like my early 20s again.you do you. I gave you a medical source if you want to challenge your beliefs. Im secure in mine  yet you seem threatened by someone having a different belief. let that go. thats not how the world works. best of luck.
@barbadosl questions why.  lol. yup! thanks! see ya.
@barbadosl questions why.  tldr
just cook the meat  seasoning based on your preferences. add some vegetables and eggs to that mix and youre good to go
@sunttu333  but thats boring. if I wanted something like that  then I would have already done it. plus there are recipes that turn something from simple like ham burger meat or being creative to make thatsame type meat to a level of a filet mignon.
@m3tr01d86  it might be boring but its optimized and it gives me results. always worth a shot but you do what s best for you.
@sunttu333  optimized is great  but optimized in both nutrients and flavor would the best case scenario is if you want more later instead of having a chance of regressing to old food habits. far lower. I d rather stack the odds in my favor by doing something for the food that adds flavor.
anyone else read that holy cow in the the will farrell doing harry caray voice
the issue is that allot of vegans dont eat the proper things I been vegan for 8 years now and am fine you gotta know what to eat.
@the veggster good day  I felt fine until I experienced getting out muscled by 14 year olds in judo and brazillian juI jitsu at 19. three  months earlier that was not happening lol. its true that there is a lot of protein for plant based but the protein quality is almost non  existent.
I use to know a person that was vegan and almost died  no they eat meat thank God  also that person eats soy beans  salad  and oreos but expects to be nutrientionally balanced dont be a fool. only people who suffer on a vegan diet are those who are ignorant to what they are eating  oreos are vegan but that doesnt mean that you d get all your nutrients from oreos.
hope he s ok
I went vegan once  but unfortunately my estrogen levels increased by 2000 . I also lost a lot of friends because I felt the need to tell everyone I was vegan  despite nobody asking. I also spent more money on soy than fuel and electricity. I started eating meat again and within seconds  I felt my dignity coming back. I can genuinely understand why twitter users and redditors are so angry  bitter  and miserable all the time. they are genuinely sick.
love your channel. thanks for the health tips. as far as dairy goes  cow s milk is designed to add weight to a calf quickly.also  when you pray  you are talking with your loving daddy. pray to God in thatstyle.
thank you melonie!  Ive been carnivore for almost 1000 days myself!  Ive been healthier than Ive ever been!  eat a  ppl!
it hurt looking at him.  my dad lost weight when he got cancer and seeing the before and after picture bring back memories.   I really hope thats its just is alimentation and nothing more.
about the vegetarian diet of buddhist monks  I heard before that the monks supplement their diet with traditional medicines and rigorous physical exercises. its the reason they can maintain their diet.there s even famous story about indian monk who went to a buddhist temple and upon seeing the monks there weak and sickly  he devised some exercises to make them stronger. gradually it became shaolin kung fu  p
wonderful video  keep spreading the good word !
Im gonna set a timer for 14 years from now so I can get a picture of you then and then put them side by side with a screen shot from this video and then blame it on your diet. lol.
yeah  I agree with you vegan diet is not the way to go your body needs protein which is important for building and maintaining muscle! Ive lost 50 pounds by doing intermittent fasting along with keto but have been considering switching over to the carnivore diet!
vegan or meth head  would be a fun drinking game.
I think he looks fine he s probably fit as hell he s just not bulked up but he looks healthy to me
the last line of the scripture is a very powerful concept. interestingly enough  in captain america  civil war  when ironman recruits peter  he asks him why he does it. peter says   when you can do the things that I can  but you dont and then the bad things happen  they happen because of you.  if disney only knew lol
can we begin to use the go vegan like we use the bad facial surgeries  to avoid people ruining their lives
yay  Imade it into the video.  ye  Ive been drinking lots of milk too.  thats alright.  I needed to gain some weight.  thanks for the tips.
wow he has aged hard! the last year or two.
I think he might be looking like this for his role in oppenheimer  directed by Christopher nolan. he is playing lewis strauss.
woah I cant believe thats him. 2 years of this truly did take its toll.
he actually looks healthier than you but he is obviously older.
could it be that he is just prepping for a role  in oppenheimer as lewis strauss  where he is supposed to look elderly.
robert downey jr preparing for his role as steve-o
I agree  never went vegan. though I know how it feels to down some beef bone broth and get such a surge of energy
interesting  but damn 2000 percent
some quality greentext in the comments  I see
@vde18   be me
I felt my dignity coming back. for some reason this had me rolling   like you stopped short from basically saying you felt your very humanity came back.
lol the difference between these pics is 14 years
@antipaganda  ah my bad. I guess Imissed that detail. thank you.
steve-o looks better than this!
thank you.your verse s help me think every time.
I want a pet that is so on the same level as me that it quietly and politely leaves the room when I start recording
could he be doing this for a movie that is coming up
I greatly appreciate your Bible study segments !!!!
Goddamn! get that man a ham sandwich asap!
wow he s unrecognizable. he looks like someone s pawpaw who should be fishing off a pontoon boat. I was afraid he was going to break a hip when he flexed.
I really dont know how to stick to carnivore   I have a mainly meat based diet. Im 6ft 2 at 195 and Ive been hitting the gym 7 days a week but having been carnivore once before the gains you can get are insane on it.but the cravings getting into it are animalistic for me.
been on carnivor for 6 weeks  lost 15lbs of fat. 215 down to 200
as a man who lives in florida  I know your mom s feelings  but then again we have headlines like  florida man stabbed with alarm clock.
he looks like he s 70 years old now
honestly if I dont eat at least one protein I d go nuts. eggs  chicken lamb pork I need them all then a boatload of eggplant  onions peppers and carrots
God has you touching lives keep up the great work
he looks like he s 90 years old. holy molly.
it amazes me that people like melonie or anna tswg have haters. they seem like the nicest people.
he must be preparing for a movie
please keep reading longer Bible passages!  they re great!
share your faith  its refreshing to see
Im vegan atheist from kolkata        love you rdj
that lizard story is going to haunt us all forever. Ive heard of furrys but scaleys  thats a new one
you always knew how to make a man feel   small .

love the hair !! btw how do you do the meat now with the insane prices
love the scripture part of your vids!go mel!
I cant recognize him anymore. he realy just looks like a normal grandpa now.
the slight change in the intro is gonna take some getting used to but I ll warm up to it eventually.
he went from iron man to aluminum foil man
honestly  your hair looks great
I d be willing to bet if he is rumored to still be doing another sherlock holmes and God willing is not back on the junk trainers we ll get downey back in great shape.
robert looks that way because he is playing a old man in a movie about the manhattan project  if you look at set photos he is dressed up as a old man.
he doesnt even look the same  he looks emaciated. he s literally wasting away. his body is eating itself.
I really hope he is doing this to himself on purpose for his upcoming movie oppenhiem. hopefully after filming he goes back to how he used to look 4-5 years ago
the contrast is immense!!!
nothing like a good ribeye medium-rare!
from robert downy junior to looking like steven colbert
ms mac  completely off-topic  but ... is youtube messing with your volume  when youre on simpcast or otherwise doing live-streaming  I can set my computer volume to about 3 10 and you come in loud and clear  like pretty much every other youtube channel I watch   but on your mmgb videos  I have to crank the volume to 5 10 to be able to hear you.on-topic  rdjjr looks like he s dying  shifting myself to a more-carnivore diet and already starting to feel better  loving the verse of the day. keep up the good work!
can you imagine people coming into your comments section being like  your hair offends me!  and then getting canceled for floofy hair we live in a weird timeline  but I dont think its that weird yet. give it a few months.
have you seen jordan peterson on joe rogan talking about his meat only diet  it has done wonders for him. I know everyone is different but Im thinking more meat and less everything else is better than most think.
dang  that before and after rdj picture looks like tony stark when he and nebula were rescued from the stranded spaceship in  endgame  and he was near death.
robert downey jr  post-iron deficiency  kinda reminds me of thomas ian griffith of cobra kaI - if the latter lost his touch in martial arts. . . .
I do complete meals. protein salad vegetable complex carb  fruit for each meal except breakfast where I have protein complex carb  fruit. I eat 3 meals a day  everyday plus complex carb or protein in-between each meal.  our gut is considered our second brain .  it regulates our mood weight bowel movements  blood sugar if you give it the energy to do so through the food you eat which God has provided for us.
he suddenly looks like a 70-year old
he looks how normal people should look he cant help that the perception fo health is to look slight obese I looke the same as he does and am not malurished or annything its just how you look when youre not slightly fat or buffed.
I was just going to comment the same until I saw your post.
in two years he looks like he s aged at least 30. what makes it worse is that all the sycophants on the entertainment tv shows will fawn over him and tell him how good he looks. that fruitarian diet is even worse. ashton kutcher did that for the movie he did on steve jobs and he ended up becoming seriously anemic. some of them its an ideology that they are hellbent on following no matter what. they call out men that are built up as promoting  toxic masculinity.  that tells you all you need to know.
keep sharing the truth of the living God  sister!
dont really think this proves anything. thumbnail is from many years ago  the other pic for comparison is lit completely different and probably shopped and with a pump. downey was never really jacked  he was always just kinda lean and sinewy.  check out the vanity fair interview from 2014 https   www.youtube.com watch v smuuohygrnu  looks similar to the pic on the right. I doubt downey was ever in a bodybuilder or weightlifter mindset  so ofcourse he s not gonna put on a lot of real mass and maintain it with heavy compound movements that will fuck with your joints unless you ve been doing it for a long time  since joints take way longer to build up than muscles. and if you wanted to  you could check out frank medrano  calistenics guy thats been vegan for over 7 years I believe  seems to be working just fine for him.
he most likely did this because his wife went vegan. which most likely means their whole family is vegan and I think he still has young kids. I hope him and his wife aren t making the kids go vegan either or pets for that matter.  vegancats
he kind of looks like a discount version of steve from blue s clue s. except he has to find the next footprint.
rdj looks like he s a day away from chewing on a steak  mans looks hungry he s gotta be craving meat and eggs  I hope he wakes up soon before his endocrine system fails him
people were not meant to survive on vegan diets.  I still cant believe there s a portion of people who believe they can be vegan and healthy.also when I first saw rdj s photo I 100  thought it was a photo of johnny knoxville   I know  I probably butchered the spelling
God I feel sad for robert  since iron man to now... a steady decline
some people could maintain looking somewhat healthy when they use a ton of supplements to make up for the nutrients they re missing by going vegan. but that doesnt last long either.
going vegan turns you into johnny knoxville !
I read the title of this video and thought   yikes! the dude s taking on his tony stark character a little too seriously - like trying to recover from his alcoholism. . .  or is that a stretch   no  thats not a pun on your earlier elastic band comment  not intentionally! imma bounce back
good grief  beef only I guess you do you but I think whatever you ve been doing is just perfect.
ok...... he looks 10 years older then he is. he looks older then my father who is 16 years older then him and does not work out.
Im sorry mel. I was with you at the start with the comparison between robert before and and during his vegan diet. Im subbed to shawn s channel and enjoy the content but there is no way anyone gets his size without some chemical help. so to compare both body types is will doing robert a huge disservice. do I have any proof that he chemical aids well of course not but he is sure packing on more muscle mass from what anyone would think comes from being a natty!. maybe one day he ll do a liverking and tell all of his followers which chemicals he cycles  .
thats him oh man. he needs to eat a burger.
give me a steak  elk  deer  venison   bison  moose bear etc any day. I grew up in small town maine on my grandfather s dairy farm. we raised our own beef and pork.
I think something that needs to be addressed here with regards to rdjr s physique deterioration is the fact that because of the nature of his profession  there s a very high probability that he was on steroids when he was jacked. a large percentage of athletes and actors are on some form of performance enhancing drugs  just no one really talks about it. feel free to watch more plates more dates on youtube about this subject. his avengers co-stars were likely on steroids too. if he was on them and got off  and went vegan  that would help explain the dramatic loss in muscle massremember everyone  in the words of ufc fighter nate diaz   everybody s on steroids
rdj is 57  but on those photos he looks like hes 80.
thats horrible  I truly feel bad for iron man. just because he offed himself in the movies is no reason for him to do it in real life.
you would think he had cancer its nuts.
also people forget that a lot of the  healthy vegans  are in their 20 s. the time you can do some damage and still not see it.
@one pound swallow two pound coconut  right!
yeah  except nate was wrong. literally a good amount of fighters were clearly the same after usada showed up. yet a bunch deflated. a lot were on the sauce  but not even close to all. rdj literally had one of the most attainable bodies out of all of the cast. also without a doubt hemsworth is juicing. so is chris evans. rdj could be  but the idea that every star is okay with signing up for the sauce is a little bitstupid. it is not true that it was as heavy at the time he took the role of iron man. so they would need to bend to his desire. if he didn t want to do steroids  they would be hard pressed to not allow it. he is the star  and they couldn t just replace him easily. he has a ton of time to get into shape  and has the access to great gym instructors  as well as health dietician s. he could easily have obtained this body. now Im not saying you are wrong. Im just making a case for what I believe to be more likely. he is old  and he didn t seem to lose it as fast as someone who just dropped the juice. that of his age combined with veganism is very likely to get us here. that is my belief at least.
bodybuilding  before I switched to mma  was my life I cannot tell you how many vegans will argue w you and say you can be a bodybuilder or mma fighter on a vegan diet..and maaaan! those vegans get mad...its like a cult
another problem these days is our soil has more heavy metals from industry leeching into the soil. vegetables and plants absorb these heavy metals from the ground  so for someone who eats a ton of this stuff heavy metals just accumulate in the body. this seems to lead to weird health issues that cant be diagnosed  unless a discerning health practitioner knows where to pinpoint the cause
a little bit of broccolI is not going to kill ya!
but your s is ms. mac  woo hoo! why does she want to be shredded  she s perfect. but seriously I never saw him so jacked until he was iron man. before he was in the movie I was skeptical. Imean he s professional enough of an actor that Im sure downey could change his body for roles like Christian bale. but when he appeared in iron man it was.like.he had tom cruise trainer or something. Imean he never was that built for chaplin  lol. but now  I hope thats a vegan diet and he s not using again.
there s a very real chance I would have mistaken him for ellen degeneres at a casual glance.
it is apparent that downey is dealing with malnutrition. I have rarely seen people maintain a healthy body while being vegan. that is sad to see...
the vegan deterioration explains a whole relating to an experience of mine   four years ago I have fully ruptured my achilles at a downhill race   dont worry  had very little blood in my adrenaline so didn t feel a thing    and right after surgery I checked with a nutritionist to speed up the recovery - being a vegan bodybuilder  the nutritionist pushed a little too much into a vegan diet  to the point I consulted with another nutritionist  which gave me   what I think it was   a more balanced plan to follow - fast forward to last week  when I swapped to a gym closer to where Im based   and with plenty of working machines   and I find the vegan nutritionist coaching people around - my very first thought was how much she had  changed  over the last few years  and looking at robert I can definitely see a resemblance on what a vegan diet can do to a person - I understand some people might need to go on a vegan diet for health   or whatever   reasons - but we are all different. different body compositions and shapes and forms  and what works for one  might not work for someone else - you know yourself best  so I agree with doing what one think its best for them - all thatsaid   you can keep your broccolI  I ll have my steak.. medium-rare..
wtf he s gone from cool to Ive got sweets and weed in the van kids.
as someone who tried to go vegan and landed myself in the hospital  my advice to anyone is dont consider a vegan diet  there s nutrients in things like meat and animal matter that our body absolutely needs. there s a fantastic article that is called 10 reasons I ll never be vegan that provides some fantastic insight that breaks down the science of what the body needs vs. things that a vegan diet do not provide and the fact that certain vegan substitutes are comprised of highly processed non foods. I hope that rdj realizes that the diet he s chosen isn t a healthy one  a lack of certain nutrients can and will affect certain brain functions and reasoning because his brain s not getting what it needs to make his brain function correctly   iI know that probably sounds weird  and supplements just aren t going to cut it.
I drink whitetail deer blood in the morning instead of coffee  ganon mode
first hair and now abused lizards. the Gods must be crazy.hair looks fantastic!go boom!
thats why venison is considered gamy  and the one shot kill is ideal
good Lord! he s aged 20 years!
celebrities cant hang out with normal people too much  so living inside theirs eco chamber have its toll  I suppose...
him and brie larson looked like completely different people Lordy I couldn t believe it what haaaappened
your hair looks great.
youre thoughts on the long term effects of a vegan diet aren t universal. I d argue its largely applicable to american vegans whose diets were already limited prior to switching to just plants. in comparison when I worked in the caribbean and south america my rastafarian colleagues were robust and strong men  they were all casing hands  after a lifetime of an ital diet. the volume and diversity of plants they ate I have never seen replicated among north american vegans  probably a key factor in the poor health outcomes I see in north american vegans.
critical drinker brought me here  and so glad for that. so looking forward to this channel.
hair looks great!!!
he was 14 years younger in than picture of course he s going to look older
define cult. also  Im pretty sure conor mcgregor was whooped by a vegan.
thats not malnutrition thats actualy  how casual not fat people look.
@the veggster good day  significant proportion of casual people are also suffering from malnutrition even when they are not fat. they just didnt realize it yet.but the difference between iron man and vegan man is quite...stark.
@muneiro valibas  well played  good sir. the internet needs more wordsmiths like you.
@the veggster good day  no that is not. he has sunken looking skin. that is not what a casual non-fat person looks like.
I am vegan and currently 82kg for someone 165cm so yeah  I definitely dont look skinny at all.
@dr rd  you can be fat and still have malnutrition issues btw. your weight can be the most obvious indicator but its not the most important issue.
Imean yeah the pics where taken 14 years appart...
we have been given rational thought for a reason  so we are capable of judging the morality of human actions. what we aren t capable of is judging someone s heart and their culpability for their sins. this is why we aren t the ones that condemn people s souls but we do judge their actions  and we are even instructed to. it is the foundation of law making--the ability to make moral judgments. love the sinner  hate the sin
Imay have a warped view of veganism cause I had an eating disorder so I would almost use veganism as an excuse but veganism made me less social because you had to plan all your meals out so much  it gave me an excuse to restrict because it required more effort to eat enough calories  it made me think I was more moral than others  higher than thou  I felt healthy but I was always chasing a nutrient equivalent to a sugar high  its all carbs  I was always bloated  getting enough protein isn t a problem like people say but many vegans make you scared about fats and oils  the lifestyle makes you inevitably get into a form of activism where you berate others even in a respectful way its harsh and you cant come back from it because years later people will tell you that youre a hypocrite for eating meat now  it makes you want to only associate with other vegans and when you step away from the lifestyle you get basically excommunicated    it makes you become really sensitive to animal products when introducing them back for even your whole life afterwards in some cases where you can be intolerant. even with this said I wouldn t not recommend it I genuinely loved vegan food because Im an extremely great cook and knew how to be nutritionally adequate I just didn t do it properly because my eating issue. overall I think the morality is the bigger issue not health. my health problems related to veganism I didn t list because they were disorder related by far. veganism on its own isn t bad for humans if you genuinely plan out all your meals. it has to be your whole life or you have to be rich.
umm healthy robert downey jr photos you got was from over 10 years ago in movie  he s 57 now. he s suppose to look like that age now. no meat can stop him from aging like that
tbh rdj was probably using some sort of testosterone treatments and working out heavily to get that body and since he quit doing ironman he probably no longer abides to that workout schedule.  I know for a fact  from personal experience  that not being able to work out for a long time you will lose significant muscle mass and it gets faster with every passing day  especially for men in their late 40s and on as our testosterone starts to crash.  not trying to defend veganism but rdj is not a good example.
melonie... you have no idea how happy it made me what you made the woodchipper comment. Ive been saying this for a long time. the woodchipper is hungry. very hungry.
its always important to research before making a choice that can influence your health and in a larger part your life. also as you should also pay attention to what your body is telling you. your body will show you if a lifestyle is helpful or harmful. dont ignore the signs because of a fad or pressure from others. fun fact your skin  which is a organ  repalces itself every 35 days  and the cells are made from what you eat. so you are what you eat. sorry robert but youre a vegitable.
the only vegan Ive ever seen that didn t look like a meth addict is the wrestler bryan danielson. apparently he is only vegan because of medical reasons though.
25 48  at first  I thought you said   he will lick you up. but  you obviously said   he will lift you up. I wouldn t want him to lick me up .
oh...wow  he needs to go food wars winner chicken mary s in fronac kansas 3 times a day to look normal.as far as vegans are concerned  most trust processed crap that is mass produced like the rest of us.  the healthier vegans do everything in house.  Ive been looking into different types of diets  trying to figure what will work best for me.  I dont think there s a osfa in diets.
holy hell  he s hard to even recognize!!the lizard thing is a whole mess of creepy  pathetic  and gross!!!your hair looks  ahem  very nice!no worries there!
never met a vegan that looked healthy.
I know Im a day late but I wanted to have enough time to watch listen. Ive been vegan ever since my diagnosis with the reasoning having to do with studies showing how the type of brain cancer I have benefits from this diet. but  I know it is not for everyone and would never push it on anyone else. you can definitely do it the right way when looking at someone like bryan danielson. rdj certainly isn t looking exceptionally nice here...
keep chasing the gains!!!!!
when Imoved out of my parents house I couldn t afford to eat meat for the first month. honestly I have never felt so shitty in my whole life. I literally had no energy  even after eating and I couldn t concentrate for shit. only when I bought myself some eggs and ate them did I feel better. veganism and vegetarianism is pure malnourishment  like those starving african kids you used to see on tv  who were used to collect donations . if I had continued like that Im pretty sure I would have died eventually  no doubt about it .
maybe he started using again and is using veganism as an excuse..
thats why one does not simply remove meat or anything that has collagen and animal protein in their diets. a small amount every single day could make a huge difference.
I like animals. honestly  I like animals more than I like humans. I wont go vegan but I am thinking about going plant based keto.
I anticipate lab grown meat.
as the verse said  you never know what tomorrow will bring. your life can change in an instant. continue to follow God through the good  and especially the bad times in life and know that making it to heaven is the ultimate goal in life.
those pictures are 14 years apart. the one on the left is from 2008. robert downey jr. doesnt weight train like shawn baker  so of course he isn t going to be jacked like him. I dont think he looks that bad for almost 60 years old. honestly  if shawn baker didn t lift weights  he wouldn t look much better. look at his before and after 2 years into the carnivore diet. shawn baker lost a lot of muscle mass. he had bloodwork done after going carnivore  and his test levels were very low and cholesterol very high. also  it doesnt really make sense to be anti-vegan as a Christian. the original plan for mankind  in the Bible  was to live in a garden and eat every  herb bearing seed . half of my family are seventh day adventists and either vegetarian or vegan and very healthy. vegan deterioration uses videos of raw fruitarians who starve themselves and lay in the sun all day.
Imean she is lair its not like she would even care if she found out she was wrong.
@shinigamI wolf  true
you had a fair take up until your take on Christianity. idk about you but Im not going to  call anything impure that God has made clean.   acts 10 15
@keithh23  its true thatshe is lair  what
her body needs the diet she s on cause she s so skinny  just because it works for her doesnt mean it works for everyone else
youre comparing shirtless rdj 2009 from sherlock holmes where it was required for him to work out... to 13 years later vegan rdj. dude was average build for most his iron man career. he s just slender now with light hair. play fair.
also not saying rdj looks bad in the picture on the left  but that is a well lit  and very probably photoshopped picture. also  different poses  and he s wearing a baggy shirt in his second picture  no makeup  and no beard stache.I agree with you on the vegan diet  have done a fair bit of listening and reading about the diet   but these two pictures are really apples to oranges.though I will say the doctor you put up has a very much more built physique than even rdj from the doctored photo.
maybe its for a movie role
not sure if this is the case in rdj s. but  vegan s really seem to love to ignore protein. which is something youreally shouldn t ignore. seems like he needs to add some almonds  walnuts or mmm pistachios to his diet.
he should try shawarma
Ive actually had the opposite results from cutting down meat and becoming avitarian  vegetarian that occasionally eats birds . I slimmed down from the line of being overweight and more centered and Ive been able to build more muscle and my hypoglycemia is less of a concern. Ive gotten sick less often and heal more quickly and Ive always looked young  but I look more youthful than before. my eyes have become sharper too  I hadn t noticed how much nightvision I lost  but its like being 9 again.I would not recommend veganism though or even vegetarianism unless you are dedicated to eating healthy. vegan prepared foods are often some of the least healthy things you can eat with tons of palm oil and disturbing and unpalatable amounts of salt. if you eat that junk or dont at least try to keep a rough idea of nutrition in mind  veganism and vegetarianism will destroy you. for me  I eat a lot of chilI and curry which are very nutritionally diverse and sweet potatoes and make most of my own food. if you are using things like rice  flour  lettuce or russet potatoes as a crutch and eating little else  its not going to be good  you have to make sure you are getting complete protein and all your vitamins and minerals.Im kind of curious how you ate as a vegan  because Ive seen and tasted their prepared food.
Ive been vegan for a little over a year now and have two different blood tests that came back normal. all the doctors I have spoken to have said that a vegan diet is healthy. the american dietetic association says a well planned vegan diet is appropriate for all ages.
its probably for a film role.
only tried veganism once  and I was so weak and emaciated after only about a week. no way am I going back to that!
he turned into stephen colbert
pretty sure my diet would be improved by going carnivore. cutting out carbs  and sugar mainly  but not starving eating plant matter my body doesnt process well.
vegan diet has many issues  although they have some alternatives  it is not sufficient to replace meat protein
Im so happy Im not a vegan.
ey melonie Im pretty sure you just compared a guy with a hollywood vegan lifestyle to a guy who s borderlining on the bodybuilding lifestyle. diet does play a huge part  yeah  but the sheer amount of work and dedication that doctor is putting into his body on the regular drastically outweighs what rdj is doing. so thats a pretty big part of it.
good afternoon and good evening melonie. anyway I just want to say that I do hope that robert downey jr gets healthy and get stronger fast too bc being not healthy and not eating healthy and right is not good for his health and his heart too  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to make a comment on this post  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful   great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
itseems thatsome might conflate going  with a vegetarian diet and going vegan.  a vegetarian diet allows cheese and things that are a product of an animal as opposed to the meat which often times kills the animal when youre eating that part  when eating something made from the product like its milk or something that they can produce without killing them.  the vegan diet doesnt allow any product of an animal and is born from more cultish religious beliefs.also  on the topic of the amount of stress an animal has when it passes  kobe beef utilizes this with the farmers pampering the cow with massages and feeding it alcohol and whatnot.  I think some farmers in america tried doing this themselves.  I haven t tried it  too broke  its pretty expensive  from what Ive heard   but its something I heard
omg melonie  your going to get cancelled again... you can not say vegan is bad! how will you survive this will be like the 3rd or 4th time!
freedom is the ability to go to hell with a handbasket.
Im 6 1  185 lbs male and Ive been vegan for over 8 years now and Ive never been healthier. Im also certified in plant based nutrition so I can confidently say youre really not educated on this topic to speak on it. still enjoy your channel tho.
we lost iron man in 2018 and now its 2022 and we ve got iron-deficiency man.
even if they dont ignore it  plant protein is simply not sufficient
@melonie mac go boom
@melonie mac go boom  I prefer filet mignon s for my protein. expensive but satisfying  p
if you need supplements for a diet to work its not adequate
@assassin 9958  youre aware that the animals you eat are given lots of supplements right  youre also aware thatsome of our foods are fortified with different micronutrients to make them more nutritious right  all the matters when it comes to your diet is balance. to claim thatsupplements make your diet inadequate is a silly and arbitrary way of measuring the efficacy of diets.
@josh h  animals aren t commonly supplemented try again if a supplement is required for a diet to work that diet is inadequate
its not a fair comperison she takes a foto of robert when he isnt working out he is on his down time and then she takes a foto of shawn who is super ripped hardcore working out thats just dishonesty on her part and she is talking unnessasery shit on veganism.yes some people dont know how to eat and waste away thats true but most are doing fine I dont go on a biast rant about how meat eaters die or look bad either I just say be honest and dont talk biased trash about other peoples lifestyle.she was dishonest enuf not to look up vegan bodybuilders yet she shows a meat eating bodybuilder just to swing it her way.
@the veggster good day  you are in fact showing bias. most do not apparently know what they are doing. they look like rdj here. not good.
sure thing bud  sure thing. not like you sound like every vegan ever.
@one pound swallow two pound coconut  facts are facts  regardless if you believe them or not. you act like Im making myself out to be some super athlete  this is very average stats
8 years vegan here  never had a problemrobert has aged very well  dont know what she s talking aboutactors often take steroids and dye their hair for a role  thats probably why his look has changed so drastically
different people have different digestive genetics  and in fact gut bacteria make up the majority of a human s digestive genetics. plainsdwelling native americans adapted over thousands of years to digest bison. people living in jungles adapted to eating lots of plants. its narrow minded to assume that any one diet works for everyone. robert downey jr s problem is that he was healthy eating his original diet  then changed to a different one. the fool. great health a hard to achieve
wait oh my I thought he was an entirely different person!
barring the obvious fact that his  robert downey jr.  age 57  is nowhere near a  complete protein  diet where you use quinoa and other fare to nobly dodge the bullet of slaughtering livestock  you do also realize that hollywood infamously enforces  suddenly ripped  for certain roles  including and most especially the cinematic adaptations of superhero comics   Christian bale will tell you all about it.other tricks include drinking cream before a bodybuilder competition  this produces puffed-out veins.  its not pleasant  considering the frequency of heart attacks amid bodybuilders and steroid users  to do that.  this can put your body through hell  but you at least look good in front of the camera.  looks of any kind mean nothing if you have other issues such as cholesterol  pre-diabetes  or muscle atrophy--issues beneath the surface.naturally  attempting a complete protein diet through vegetable matter has side effects depending on what youre eating.  yet  for the derision towards all-veggie diets  I am still not sold on all-meat diets.  I thought humans were omnivores  the simpsons taught me that the food chain is a vortex that ends with humans at the center and top of a spiral.  bears are avid opportunists.  crocodiles go for anything smaller than them like you should.  only time you get away with a grass diet is when everyone else around you is doing the same thing and that everyone can run once one of them shows up.  or  as tourettes s guy s father might say   so was the brontosaurus--and look what happened to that asshole.    he also disparaged the price tag   two dollars for a piece of toast   bullshit!  regular  nonstop soy protein lets the phytoestrogens take over  but soy oil does not have that issue  the bean s fatty portion has mere traces of the protein .  strange source  but see for yourself https   foodforbreastcancer.com foods soybean-oilthe japanese eat tofu often.  they also eat seaweed  meaning they eat everything.  they live on islands with geothermal complexities--they cannot afford to be picky.  few natives can capitalize on any specific diet for long since supplies seem palpably low.  they also slim down as a result of avoiding calorie-rich fare  their sensitive palate does not tolerate sweetness well  so their desserts are very fluffy and airy.  their pre-made dinners are also awesome because of city hustle  frequenting mom-and-pop convenience stores is never a death sentence.and somehow  their take on heavy metal  see anthem  is technically grandiose and laced with power threads.  even akira yamaoka cannot substantiate any perceived  grunge era  like the states underwent in the early nineties.  maybe its a stereotype  but clenching martial arts culture close to their hearts keeps their local society balanced because anybody anywhere at any time might kick ass--crooks cannot weather the direct approach.  2a rights should encompass this line of thinking.jokes aside  I am skeptical of everything about the dieting world because  my take  activity plays a far greater role than diet.  I heard that regular exercise adjusts testosterone due to it rebalancing demand and supply.
btw ur hair looks much more healthy natural
I d never go vegan myself  but in fairness that doctor is on steroids. muscles develop a certain way depending on genetics  but even if he were 20  they dont develop in that form.  steroid muscles are always easy to spot. but especially in that doctor s case.  every guy  every single one  loses both testosterone and muscle mass with age. the obly way to build it in your 50 s is artificially. its a bit unfair to compare a  roid guy to downey junior.  plus  the age downey junior switched it up  again is an age he s not developing the muscle mass he could even 5 years ago. along with the fact he may not be working out anymore. Im ameat eater. I agree some of downey jr. s look is due to lack of nutrients from an unnatural diet. there s no debate to be had  human beings are carnivores. but those comparisons are a bit less honest. dont get me wrong  Im not saying melonie here is lying or purposely manipulating. I think she simply doesnt know this subject in depth and took what she saw at face value. me personally  as someone who was a body builder back in their 20 s  I dont have any respect for those that juice up.  downey jr. certainly needs some more food in his diet  but that doctor is lying if he claims he s healthy. despite looks  doing juice I d say the doc is more unhealthy on the inside than downey junior. now Im off to eat a steak.
the worst part is robert flexing. I can understand a vegan that is aware they look like a meth head and just dont care. however  robert is flexing like he is proud of his  progress   like  dude  we saw you at peak  this is a massive downgrade. you wanna go vegan  fine  but dont pretend this is physical progress.
it looks like he has aged 10 years.
yeah mel... the most hatefull part of veganism is the smug sense of self supiority.   rdj isnt shrinking because of it though.   he  and most actors  especially the marvel people  have to maintain some pretty grulling work out schedules to get in shape for shooting.   thats just him retired.    hell look at secy ass channing tatum in between films....
he looks like johnny knoxville
as much as I love meat... all meat all the time just sounds like constipation.
the only time vegan or vegitarian works is when you have an... you know what that probably an offensive word  a  dedicated and constant view  of what you are eating from a nutrient level  and are capable of over eating the hell out of the food to match what meat can do  its really the only hope you have if you ever go vegan for any reason besides medically required diets  and even then most people cant force themselves to eat like that to make veganism healthy. personally went back to my old diet while im not able to work out due to family living situations just to see how much I gain over how long  about 15lb over the course of 9 months  really wanted to know how fast I would gain weight if I went to a crappy diet again with minimal if any working out  got my answer  its not fast and its easily trackable and adjustable.
downey should buy a dog and call it a  veggieterrier .
I am vegan  so I probably am bias  but the way robert looks at that age is what we are supposed to look at his age. the older we get the less mass we are supposed to carry. it is the sad truth  no one stays young forever. the old muscle man is probably not natural  using steroids and being in very bad health even though he looks strong. it is okay to eat whatever we want  but Imy opinion there is no need to eat meat or other secretions of animals. and some things we do in the kitchen is macabre  like eating chicken meat covered in chicken eggs  or cow meat eaten with cheese made from cow milk .
when you have to look at the name above the post you know they are doing something wrong.
he looks fine to me why should the standert be that a person should be big and ripped  normal people look like how he looks on a vegan diet most people are either working out making there musscel bigger then normal or there getting fat or beeing fat thats the social norm but its not actualy normal.both my uncles dont work out and they just work and they look like he looks on a vegan diet they dont over eat they eat normal I think youre perception of normal isnt normal.I am on a vegan diet and I look a tad bit bigger then him but I almost look the same and I feel good how you look shouldnt be a indication of health but how you feel and how healthy youre sighns and blood lv and nutriton lv and cholestrol are.he looks fine to me but to a person who is getting fat or has big mussckles he wil look skinny because thats the social norm.the other thing is you have to know what to eat on a vegan diet if you dont youl get messed up am vegan for 8 years and I am fine I kind of know what to eat and what nutrition or vit pills to take.how his skin looks  his skin looks the same as youres does he is just getting older now.he chooses not to hurt kill and exploit animals and you should respect that not go on a dissing rant if you failed veganism that doesnt mean veganism failed it means you fucked up.
you want a real look at what veganism does to people  just look at before and after pictures of the rock s vegan phase.
I almost did not think it was him at first . dam!! that doesnt look good
its not like less animals are slaughtered to grow vegan food  its just different animals than cows.
you do know that the first picture is 14 years old  right   not 2 years ago
the pics have been taken 14 years appart... thats why
its not  many get the runs from too much fats even lol
@melonie mac go boom  if you drink enough water you ll be ok
@melonie mac go boom  Ive often wondered about the constipation but was too embarrassed to ask.
incorporating olive oil in your diet solves that problem.
@telethea the end bringer    embarrassed!
20 38 there are many sins where I can 100  say I could see myself doing it in a bad enough situation  I cant see myself forcing myself on a lizard though  Imean gun to head  do it or die possibly  but outside of scenarios that would overwhelmingly never happen I can say no  I wouldn t.Imean statistically its unlikely you will be killed by a cow at any point in time  but the chance is never 0 even sitting on the toilet in your own home.
he aged that much in two years
even in the Bible in the books of exodus and leviticus that have all the rules God had jewish people follow before Jesus came and gave us the new covenant  God didn t exclude all meat from the list of stuff you couldn t eat  even God knows you need to eat meat!
humans are omnivores. neither our meat nor our plants are anything like they were a few hundred years ago. but meat diets are healthier than vegan for sure. as for prayers being answered  all prayers are answered. but God s answer may not be the answer we want. he sees around corners we cant.
he looks just like johnny knoxville.
guys  being vegan doesnt automatically make you nutritional. you still have to pick the specific foods that give you those nutrients. oreos are vegan  doesnt mean you will be surviving off oreos. seriously  all these malnourished  vegans  you guys are talking about I can guarantee only ever ate a salad with maybe so soy beans or somethin and called it vegan. you have to have variety in your plate because the nutrients you d normally get from just eating meat are spread out in different foods. meat just has all of it in one so its easy to just eat meat and survive off that but if you mix up your diet on a vegan diet you d 100  be more healthy than eating meat. also eating plant based foods is way cheaper than meat  its only expensive when you eat things like tofu or soy. also meat industry is subsidized  in reality the production of meat is 5 times more expensive than if we went full blow plant based. you d be able to buy food for a month for like  200 if plant based farms had the same support
he looks like he s on chemotherapy
I understand the vegan mindset of not wanting to eat another living being  and completely agree that mass livestock farms need to be held to account to provide better care given to the animals  but unfortunately  the human body was not designed to run on plant protein.  its simply not a substitute for animal protein and it never will be.
we evolved as omnivores. meat was essential for developing our modern brains. we very likely wouldn t have become as intelligent as we are as a species if not for meat.
he has history with drugs  this is like everyone being surprised about iggy pop young and now  anthony kiedis  jagger etc why so serious  lmao
in the beginning  we weren t meat eaters. genesis 1 29-30 esv and God said   behold  I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth  and every tree with seed in its fruit. you shall have them for food. and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth  everything that has the breath of life  I have given every green plant for food.  and it was so. it was after the flood that God was like  ok  eat animals. so  I dont look down on vegetarians or vegans. if you want to eat meat  have at. if they dont want to  they can have at it.romans 14 1-6 nivaccept the one whose faith is weak  without quarreling over disputable matters. 2 one person s faith allows them to eat anything  but another  whose faith is weak  eats only vegetables. 3 the one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not  and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does  for God has accepted them. 4 who are you to judge someone else s servant  to their own master  servants stand or fall. and they will stand  for the Lord is able to make them stand.5 one person considers one day more sacred than another  another considers every day alike. each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind. 6 whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. whoever eats meat does so to the Lord  for they give thanks to God  and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. I think a lot of vegans and just as many meat eaters treat the other with contempt.
I am not on the carnivore  trademark  diet.   I am a carnivore omnivore!
a vegan diet isn t healthy long term  citation required. preferably peer reviewed.
vegan diets are the most unhealthy diets we can eat. humans were made to be mostly carnivores. keto   ketovore are the way to go. you feel so much better with a high animal fat diet.
Imean the dude is also gettin pretty old. sometimes age hits you like a brick wall in just 2-4 years. not defending the diet since that doesnt help either. probably just makes a stronger case for him to not be doing this kind of junk in this stage of his life honestly.
plants scream when you cut them. they dont like being eaten either  but at least animals aren t alive the whole time they re being eaten unlike plants. life must consume life to live  and no diet avoids the ethical dilemma of living. the further you get from consuming life   i.e. more processed food  the more diseases come in and announce you aren t eating right.that being said  meat is the most complete perfect food human beings can eat  and its worth checking out the oxford study on carnivore diet which you wont hear about in the news. take good care of yourselves!
man he just looks so old  Imean his hair is gray. edit  he kinda looks like jeremy irons now in that pic.
okay  who was touching a monkeys paw when you wished to look better than rdj
so frizzy!!!
he clearly does not know what s at steak
12 20 lizard meat with added zinc
dont forget  that the man is also aging.
misinformation
@assassin 9958  these are all facts though. Im sure you are referring to outdated information from school textbook from 30 years ago
@barbadosl questions why.  wrong try again
enjoy your supplements
@assassin 9958  thats not a peer reviewed citation
@ash robertson  inadequate diet cope
@assassin 9958  still not a peer reviewed citation
@ash robertson  more inadequate diet cope
besides  even if you believe that fruit is still not plants.
thats not rdj thats someone s smoker uncle.imo
about fibers on diet   they aways taugh me that it was at least usefull for easy your time in the  throne
either way our food system be fudged
you speak of people s desires  but what is yours  also what about your calling  Im curious to hear what it is
wait  is that rdj s malnourished grandpa   did he get cancer and not tell anyone
Jesus Christ  that pic doesnt even look like rdj at all  somebody get that man some real food!
hair is good mel!vegan can be both good   bad...
honestly would not have picked that for downey jr. and I always thought he had a rather notable face.also  has he had a nose job  tip looks smaller  or is that part of his gaunt appearance
this gives me young melanie mac vibes
couldn t he just be doing it for a role  Christian bale also likes to fatten up and slim down with a snap of the fingers...
he needs more collagen in his diet.
he looks like he s actively dying. very sad.
ffs  iron man was 15 years ago and he was bordering elderly then.
imagine the broccolI farts in the iron man suit  gas chamber
wet hair ! unacceptable!
maybe he wouldn t look as bad if he weren t dressing like a 9 year old at day camp.
thats a sever difference.
I like the hair down.
rdj looks older.
I think his supply of adrenochrome ran out
look how they massacred my boy
the pictures youre showing of him are 14 years a part.    debate vegan gains.
is he attempting sokushinbutsu
fire up the woodchippers!!!
thats just scary
poor ironman
hope I didn t offend you on the last comment Imade about u being an old lady  I was just joking around  I would never say anything intentionally to hurt anyone  I just thought it was funny!
he looks like greg fitzsimmons
since when 13 14 years old heavily  photoshopped pro picture is comparable to an amateur shooting with dogshit lighning   14 years is not 2 years melanie  you are off by just 12 years.. lol
you should have a look at a youtuber called vegan booty and see what you think about her she is a radical vegan in australia and not well like either and she also forces the family dog to go vegan only.
more like iron deficiency man
thats sad.
isn t bill gates vegan
one photo from a potato camera  compare to a model photo come on  next. there is worse problems in the world.
he needs to stop doing that.
imagine being paid millions for a movie just to live like a peasant  peasants eat plants because they dont have meat.
dont worry someone will be offended by the hair.... there s someone who s offended by everything anymore. no point in even saying it  just assume there s some asshole thats offended by whatever  and ignore the ridiculous idea.
oh no he looks emaciated. wtf dude
I always notice their hair  even watching  bad vegan  you cantell the vegans by how unhealthy their looks.
we are designed to be mostly carnivore!
debate tho
exquisite.
I dont eat meat  Im a rich guy from hollywood hills  only the poor people eat meat. snooty laugh
oooooolooking gorgeous with that hair
boom!!
he doesnt look healthy  looks like he s sick. he should listen to melonie and get on that carnivore diet.
watch the epitomeh of malnourishment. thats some stuff
melanie mac go sporty spice
if the guy wants to eat vegan then let the guy eat vegan.
please discuss this and veganism with vegan gaze! she just dropped a video responding to this.
the man is 57 and not on a strict training and eating regiment. sorry to say bit this is what happens to men as we age. he isn t fat. yes he has lost a lot of mass but this is the reality of ageing especially when you compare when he dehydrates for shirtless scenes and is possibly on test for his health and workout routine to look in superhero shape. Im certainly not pro vegan  train hard and am in great shape but you dont understand the difficulty at that age to maintain thatstandard. this video is a miss for me sorry.
your apologies for you hair is bullshit  you still look gorgeous enough
you are comparing pictures of when he was in his mid 40s to when he is in his mid 50s  of course he is going to look older  very deceptive of you.
I cant do carnivore  I was not able to poop. so I ll stick to keto.
before and after ironman!soyman...
cat!  o.o
photo 1 was from 2009 sherlock holmes. photo two was his look for a new Christopher nolan movie called oppenheimer. a 13 year difference does not equal 2. hell jared leto has been vegan for 20 years and is 50 now. next time you make confident claims  back them up with extremely strong scientific peer reviewed evidence. but I also invite you to research dr. dean ornish american physician and researcher.    dr. caldwell esselstyn cardiologist and director of the heart disease reversal program at the cleveland clinic.  and dr. neal barnard nutrition researcher and adjunct associate professor of medicine and founder of pcrm . all doctors who gave used nutrition to treat patients based on results from peer reviewed studies that they themselves conducted.
carnivore diet works. beef organs are the best form of vitamins!!
debate vegan gains
sucks that im sort of intolerant to eating beef otherwise I would try that diet.
he looks fine to me and dont compare him to a bb thats not fair  also dont fall for the social body norm those are overal not even healthy standerts if you wanna compare shawn in fairness then look up vegan bodybuilders.
oreos are not even oreos  anymore  their gmo filled  crap. God forbid they were the ones I loved when I was a kid.
its not his build. its the paleness with white hair. if he had his hair died he would just look slender.
maybe he s become vegan not for health but for the love of animals
how y all expect old people to look lol
and she got rekt!
@shinigamI wolf  delusion
@assassin 9958  very delusional thatshe used pictures that were 13 years apart and tried saying it was only a couple years.
@shinigamI wolf  vegan cult cope
@assassin 9958  I feel so sorry for you lol
@assassin 9958  dude youre the one acting like a cult members  you just spam the same response just cause melanie its being questioned about a claim she did and nobody forced to do
I so wanted to try beef liver but couldn t get to actually buying it at the store.  Im taking grass-fed beef liver capsules instead.  been feeling better along with eating carnivore.
baker also uses steroids there s no fucking way he s all natural
kitty!
the difference between those pics is 14 years  not 2 years.. jeez how hard is it to look up a picture via google..
like sI vistes al michi
your hair has been drying for a week  Im getting concerned!
what about the people who make their pets eat a vegan diet
he looks like totally different person I cant believe he looks like he s back on drugs if you just came across this picture I didn t know it was vegan diet the body needs meat not just vegetables this s nuts I cant believe anyone canthink he looks good its mad but that hollywood.
downey is channeling his inner joe biden.
go carnivore
yeesh  he looks like every talking head I see on the news now  they all have thatsame emaciated old-man look. meanwhile  there are other guys as old as my grandpa who look like arnold in his peak from a carnivore diet.
Ive been plant based  dont like the word vegan  for 6 years and I dont look like that. people who go  vegan  most of the time dont do it right. also he could be doing it for a role  who knows
is rdj losing weight for a role  sort of how Christian bale lost a shit ton of weight for the machinist. only smoking and drinking lots of coffee. geez he was anorexic.
so being a vegan isn t as healthy as they claim. more reasons to stay eating meat and considering he has losts of money Im surprised he didn t get supplements but I guess he wants to be honest
damn he looks old as heck.
vegan but ears crickets crap so that makes him a hypocrite right
can you please stop jogging my memory about the lizard those events have warped my mind.
if your diet requires supplements then its not healthy or natural. this should be common sense.
youre filming a video with still-wet hair  ! might as well just be a vegan while youre at it.
isn t that pic from 13 years ago  doesnt really make sense to compare a 13 year difference. also you said this is what happens to long term vegan but this transition was like 2 years ago and also your statement is proven false by many studies globally. on top of all that there is literal olympic athletes that are vegan  wouldn t make any sense for someone who is supposedly weak from being vegan to be holding olympics status. plus if youreally break it down to what exactly does food provide to the body you d actually come to find out that you can get all the nutrients you d get from meat by just eating a variety of plant based foods. in fact plant based foods have nutrients only found in plants that are necessary for brain  development. I think this video is just reaching  dont believe me  try to debate against earthling ed. thatshould be a fun debate to watch
you are so full of crap. youre comparing a 10 year old photo of him when he was bulking up to play ironman to now. hes 10 years older. did you know that people age   do you know that the way he looks now is the way most people looked 40 years ago before the fattening of america  you dont even know what healthy looks like anymore. good grief.
I think this is making a mountain of a molehill. the evidence on display is very weak. aside from camera video variables  like lighting  angles  fov  color-correction etc  not to mention wardrobe and whether or not a person is currently filming a movie   on-season    what are his actual metrics  muscle measurements  strength Im carnivore myself  but I just dont find this compelling
yeah. okay. most people when they vegan. make this big mistake of not eating enough. any sane vegan will tell you that. yes. even vegan gains would tell you this. me being a vegan myself. I over ate. I under eat like any other person. gained weight and lost weight on both plant based generally regarded as the vegan diet. and gained weight and lost weight on a everyone else diet.  this is a bad hot take with biased conclusions. when you look at vegan gains now. it looks like he s getting bigger. so umm.
animals are meant to be hunted  its the way of this earth
but but but plant protein is the same as meat protein!  people are gullible.
he is 57... and looks like 75. horrible
lmao hey melonie  theres this cool word you should look up that might answer your question as to why he looks so different. you may not have heard of it before but unfortunately it ll happen to all of us eventually  even to you.its called  aging . sorry to tell you this honey but you wont be a young fit adult forever. but you can still stay considerably healthy if you stop ingesting exclusively type 1 carcinogens that cause cancer and obesity and go vegan which many people have been for decades and look great lmao. what a laugh!
Im in favor of providing food animals with xanax. ambien  and a good massage before slaughter.happy meat  happy meal.
does melonie think she s buff lol   she skinny af so the meat diet aint working too lol
I am extremely offended by your hair and will never watch another video again. until you upload the next one.    p
im not a vegan but you are lying the man got old he probably not using hrt either he over 50 I dont know what you are smoking
differences between a carnivore and a vegan  carnivores dont force you to eat meat if they invite you to dinner and wont get judgemental about it  or try to convince you to become a carnivore. a vegan will force you to eat vegan at their dinner and try to convince you to become one without mentioning the dangers. a vegan will demand yourespect their food choices then refuses to respect yours. more animals are killed protecting soy bean crops than are killed in slaughter houses. if the world suddenly all became vegan nearly every food animal would have to be killed to make way for crops and the rest would mostly die of starvation  illness  neglect  and exposure. humans need certain fats and vitamins you can only get from meat to live  suppliments help but as the body starts to starve due to lack of them it builds up natural aggression. carnivores wont force a rabbit to eat meat  but a vegan will force a cat to eat vegan  which will kill it without suppliments  then they will convince themselves the cat prefers it. seriously screw veganism  go vegetarian and live.
your hair isn t dry  unsubscribed
which is more annoying vegans or people who do crossfit
we got another preacher here.. smh   eat what works best for you.. plenty of healthy life long vegans out there and peer reviewed studies showing more benefits on a plant based diet..
women aren t naturally buff regardless of diet due to testosterone levels  it takes a ton of deliberate work and eating for a woman to get  buff   which is not and never has been my goal. Im in excellent shape and health and have gained 10 lbs of muscle since going carnivore -  thank you
crossfit is a lot more dangerous
crossfit tbh cause the damage it can cause fue to ignorancia its wayy worse and its more prominent on social media
do you have one you could share
@kangjhha  well you said there are peer review studies I was hoping you had one
@yu lee  in 2003 for prevention treatment of type2 diabetese
@yu lee  whats your thoughts  views on the human diet
@kangjhha  I enjoy a died of tasty vegables and meat and eat junk food but due to my allergies it limits how much plant based food I can eat so I eat what it can imo people who eat both or one or the other should do what works for them be but be safe on how it affects or alters there body if such thing occurs
@kangjhha  and if they stop doing one for the sake of their health its perfectly fine
