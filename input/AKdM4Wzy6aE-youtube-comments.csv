Im going back to celebrating the old things I love  rather than the new things I love to hate. Im starting a classic movie review channel called  before movies sucked!  and  melonie  you have my solemn vow... I will forever go boom!
its perfectly fine to be skimpy dressed during a rainbow pride parade in front of kids but when a woman in a game does it oh no thats so wrong. xd
they probably want to show that the characters are aged in that they have more story to them and their clothing and style are reflective of that. that is how I see it.
8 19 for jurI going to be honest  wearing less clothes is not equal to wearing skin tight clothing. you can argue that you can see more in her 5 costume than this one. im generally agree they didn t get a woke treatment  as far as I can see they characters weren t made ugly  or are overly covered up but I have only seen 1 female in 3d ingame so far  so who knows.
do you know that in japan  there are started some controversy and protest against sf6 part of the audience are saying that the new models in general of sf6 looks an  april s fool  joke and weird.another part are discussing about how the face of  chun lI  looks an  politial correct  design.there a lot of disappointment about the new direction of the serie
I think along the same type of thing you do in fairness  especially ryu and ken s outfits  very modern looking and I personally cant wait to play it.
I dont have a problem with the designs in sf6. Im actually glad to see dee jay back in the game. Imiss my jamaican representation  though I was hoping to see sean. his style did grow on me a bit more besides having ryu and ken.btw  why does ken look way too much like terry bogard
the new outfits look fine.  but lets not forget  capcom gave them the new outfits so that they can release the classic outfits as dlc later down the line.  same as they did with sf5
I think the new design and the artwork for the characters looks great.
given thatsf is made by capcom japan  methinks  there a slim to none chance it would ve gone woke. Im glad it didn t. there are leaks for cammy s nostalgic outfit and thats far from woke lol. but I like how melonie said they looked more mature  cuz that description is just right  the characters  specifically ryu   chun lI  looks like they are officially masters in their martial arts ready to take on pupils  not to mention ryu s sash looks like gouken s from sfiv  who is ryu s master. looking forward to the game.
I think these outfits look pretty cool  especially honda s. gives them a lot more personality. nothing wrong with giving them alternative outfits especially if you can still play in their original outfits as long as you dont have to pay extra for them like they made us do in sf4 xp
I just think the music is already a problem  not the costumes. I absolutely agree though  these designs are great. also  an hour after that leak you shared  they had another leak of cammy performing her super on herself. abd guess what  she was in her classic costume.this game is shaping up to potentially become the 3rd strike of our generation  which was one of the best street fighters of all time. my main gripe is that the music they shared wasn t great in my opinion. if this is supposed to be the 3rd strike of this gen then you have to match the quality of thatsoundtrack.
no they gonna have all the outfits we wants as dlc lol
my problem is they made them look like this so people have to pay or grind for the original outfits or more alternative ones.
keep on making awesome content  melthey deserve to hear the truth about what s going on
seem to me like classic daigo ikeno and anyone thats into his stuff know that he has consistently evolve his art ever since cyberbots
as a fg player and fan sf6 will do the same thing mk 11 did. initial outfits will be the more covered up or woker outfits then the oldschool fans will complain rightfully so and then release the old skins via their shop or possible unlockable. similar to nrs releasing the sexier outfits which sold well or unlockable via their race towers where you had to grind to unlock them in a weeks time.  nrs initially tried to use the  mature and realistic  angel sonic capcom doesnt offer the og outfits fans will be upset but they will. typically speaking japanese developers aren t nearly as woke as american ones these days.ftr sindel and cetrion have different more curvier body types actually than jade  mileena  kitana and sonya etc among bigger racks lol.
I thought it d be nice letting people know about a few things  so here it is. we ve seen chun-lI with pants before  Imean this is like a body suit  but still I feel like this was a merging of this outfit  sa  and what we ve seen in her more classic outfit attire. I d say  its more like a merging between her classic and her cpt outfit. and not in a good way.this is what the street fighter 6 art director said. she was probably one of the hardest characters to design with this title  especially since one of the original creators of chun-lI is one of my mentors   said fujioka via game informer.  I definitely want to respect that and make a version of chun-lI that is appropriate for street fighter 6. it doesnt sound like he did if you ask me.now personally I dont have anything against this new look. its fantastic  except there s only one problem. censorship. I know for a fact that originally  she wore light blue athletic underwear  the same color as that dress of hers  over those blue leggings. how do I know this  well  she said it herself in the video.  even in her traditional outfit  this is very similar to it. its just like a different color palette  because in her old dress she still wore leggings underneath  they were just sheer and now they re not sheer.very similar to her classic outfit  yet no underwear part to be seen. thats just not her style.and thats how I knew her new outfit was censored  along with the fact they did the same thing to karin kanzukI before in street fighter v. let me prove it to you.here  you can still see traces of the missing light blue athletic underwear on the page chun-lI   street fighter 6   capcomor on this page called plenty of classic fighters return in street fighter 6 scroll down till you see the last image where she kicks ryu.why does it bother me so much  because if youre gonna create an outfit very similar to the classic one  as well as out of respect  then you dont remove something very important of her outfit  that was always a part of her style. something that also made it look far more attractive in the first place.I know mr. akiman ll never say it  but deep down  he doesnt like it either. not in the least.as I once said before  I certainly wont be looking forward to this game. especially after the many other horrifying things Ive read and seen.
excellent vod  mel! I like the new outfits   they look great   good design and style and the outfits fit the personalities of the characters. from the looks of it  most of the characters are dressed in street style attire which fits the game perfectly because   street fighter  and they have a unified style. I like the new art style  its perfect  and that the characters are not cookie cutters anymore  not all characters were cookie cutters of course  and instead each have their own style. I love that chun lI looks more chinese now and I actually prefer camie s new hairstyle over her old one. agreed that nakedness does not equate to how attractive a character is. it is extremely odd to me that people are crying on social media saying this is woke when not just the women  besides jurI who is actually less covered up than the last game   but also the men were covered up. if this was going to be woke then only the women would be covered up  the women that have curves and thick thighs would lose them  the women would be androgynous and possibly one being overweight instead of androgynous  characters would have their gender  race and or orientation changed and characters would have woke clothing accessories and say woke stuff  there s still a chance they could say woke stuff so fingers crossed that it wont happen .
I ll say the new looks do look okay at best but man Im going to say its hard to see cammy out of green Imean her being back to blue reminds me when she was a doll and honestly I dont think she should be back to blue because of that also  with cammy s new look it looks like the type of outfit that would hinder her kombat style since at least story wise  she never wore tight jeans because she s speed based
100  agree. Im going back to playing old video games   ps3 and x360 era games . this new woke pandering trash is not worth it.
homophobia
@ lucI   truthphobia
@true aryan  nah  just homophobia
@true aryan  I love this comment
yeah when I look at ryu now he looks more experienced like before he was the student and now he looks like he could be a master with his own students
@mrbust  why would they need sponsors their not ea capcom street fighter is a guaranteed success also capcom loves thier designs to mean something if you look at the leaked designs you would see that all male and female characters are different and their designs mean something like a big one would be ken he s jaded and more gruff than before he s wearing a locket around his neck that looks like it could be his daughters and the black belt around his arm symbolizes loss of someone important to him
from japan   that doesnt surprise me. that country is weird.
@kara  better than west for sure lollook what kind of president they voted lmao
you are over exaggerating hard dude. no  protests  going on. of course some people may not like it but many people do even non sf fans.
@kara  you mean the country is based.
how could you even come to that kind of conclusion of thousands of peoples different opinions  sorry but I can never take anyone seriously when they talk about how japanese players feel about something because japanese players are as agreeing with eachother as any other group aka not at all lmao
@joedatius  because I am japanese and some blogs and news are collecting the latest controversy and opinions.
@skyuru  lets assume everything you said is the truth . itstill doesnt mean shit. Im american and if I told you that I saw a bunch of blogs about collecting opinions that wouldn t make my own opinion correct or accurate to how people think. because just like japanese or any other group of people you are not and including blogs off the internet are not the voice of thousands of individuals with different opinions.
as long as they dont charge money for it like they did with the stupid locked content in street fighter 4
@blazeheartpanther  why wouldn t they charge money for some of them  mk and sf5 both have done this.
@raymkkkk  I just mean how ridicules the practice was with sf4 if yourecall that incident.
@blazeheartpanther  not really  what was it again  it must not have been too big  cause it isn t as talked about like some of capcoms other blunders like on disc characters.
@raymkkkk  it was the on disc content that hackers found. basically the dlc was already on the disc but capcom forced people to buy them on their shop instead.
@blazeheartpanther  oh  well thats not an issue anymore  people already expect thatsince they ve done it for sf5 and other games already since then.  people dont care about the costumes  people care about the characters being locked behind a day 1 paywall.
first!!!
hey speedo  beware of that lunatic with a berserk guts avatar that pop up out of nowhere disagreeing with your comments  calling people including me  bots    spammers    twist them around.yeah  his name is thedarkwanderer
@b.c. aka the new dark eclipse
didn t sony partially fund sf5  are they part of the funding of this  considering sony s playstation headquarters is now in california and staffed nearly exclusively with woke man-haters  I will not be surprised they said they weren t going to allow a sf6 if the female characters didn t get covered up more.
@3dmaster  oh I dont know but God I hope thats not true lol  because if sony has a huge say in this game then the women will definitely be more covered up because we all know woke sony and I definitely think sf6 is like mk 11 with these skins half the guys are shirtless or showing most of their chest and abs where the girls are more covered for sure.
technically mk11 would be doing sf5 did since that game alredy gave some charcters changed outfits while making classic costumes dlc.
@fighting media lounge  well honestly  mk technically was doing the alternate uniforms before sf as far as alternate outfits skins are concerned dating back to mk 4 if you want to be really technical. prior to that the older mk and sf games only did alternate color tones. mk has pretty much always had their classic outfits as well.
@mkf30  not exactly  mk did change up some of the outfits when it came to mk3
@fighting media lounge  yes exactly  prior to mk 4 no other mk and sf game did alternate costumes. Im talking as far as first to offer alternate skins in the game fir the player not a new game introducing new skins.... you can look up the dates  sf was still doing 2d at the time and even with sf ex they didn t have alternate outfits  mk the same up til mkt were just color swaps. thats not a different outfit thats a different shade. example  reptile in mk 4 had his reptilian look and his ninja look. scorpion had a skull look  sub had maskless mk 3 etc  etc as to why I said mk 4 was the first mk game to offer new skins you could actually pick prior to any mk and sf games with like 100 skins you see now days.
@mkf30  my comment that time was in reference to the idea that mk pretty much always did classic costumes until 4 something you technically wrote down  also if we re getting real technical neither series started the alternate costume craze.
@fighting media lounge  yeah but thats not what you said initially  your quote included changed outfits you said  technically mk11 would be doing sf5 did since that game alredy gave some charcters changed outfits while making classic costumes dlc. you mentioned characters changed outfits referring to the newer costumes while retaining the classic ones. I was addressing thatsaying technically mk did that first prior to any sf game then you changed your post talking about  games introducing new outfits  which was not what I was talking about. in my initial post I was talking about sf6 doing the same thing as mk 11 specifically where the initial default skins will be more covered and then have classic skins unlockable. mk has been doing that with secret skins since the 3d era...if youre talking a series to introduce alternate costumes its tekken 2  but you mentioned sf since we re talking about mk and sf...
@mkf30  I know thats what I said initially. its why I specifically said my comment that time. I only change topics when you bizzarely said mk characters have pretty much kept the same costumes until mk4  and then moved the conversation back on topic poiting out that alternate costumes isn t original to either franchise.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
@fighting media lounge  yeah was just going by what you posted. I never said mk have kept the same costumes since mk 4  the fact that you think that is bizarre since I never said that. I said mk 4 technically had alternate costumes first prior to sf since you said sf  did it before mk which is false. Imerely corrected you. you misread what I said  I was referring to alternate costumes in a game for the player  then you tried to backpedal saying  you meant a game introducing new skins costumes like mk3  which was not what I was talking about....every new fg offers new skins in every franchise.in regards to this convo which you mentioned initially mk did it before sf with new  alternate skins vis mk 4 in the late 90s....where as sf first did that with sf4 many years later.mk 4 video to what im referring tohttps   youtu.be 0lpe0uzrfe8my initial post was talking about sf6 doing the same as mk 11 in terms of how they re going about the skins where you ll have covered up as default and then sexier either unlockable or for sale.
a lot of the characters seem to have street clothes which kinda plays into the name of  y know  street fighter.my only critique is that they should ve kept cammy s camo green on her new outfit to fit on her theme  like how chun-lI and jurI got to keep their original colors
these designs look good to me  the characters look like they ve grown since the previous games  and they make sense for their fighting styles.as for costume designs for fictional characters in general  I will always point out the impracticality of bikinI armor  but also that men should be allowed to wear bikinI armor as well  if you want to wear them  then male or female  dont let anyone tell you that you cant wear the bikinI armor
zangrief s shin hair poking out of his pants is killing me haha! he is trying to one up blanka.designs are great. sf6 is how many years from sf2  would be weird if late 30 40 year olds are wearing the same clothes as a 20 year old...
this shows how damaged our society is. there was a time when no-one would even care when an outfit was changed  but these days we re all so sensitive about the intentional effort to censor and restrict things for political reasons that we read the worst motivation into every decision. I could point out how many of these men are still topless despite the women being more covered up  but typically thats something I wouldn t care about. like with the thor nude scene - typically something I would just laugh at  but the double standard is what makes me notice how absurd it is. its like a form of psychological warfare where we perpetually feel defensive because of the constant bombardment of woke-ism against everything we love.
those out fits are more modern designs and they still have character and it doesnt feel like a soulless change. ryu with a bread is kinda epic
from what Ive heard people talk about  if you dont like the new attires  the old attires are going to be alternate attires.now  the question is  do we need to pay to get those old character attires
nothing wrong with this art design  I like the style and I am actually for once looking forward to play a street fighter game. that trailer looked fun af.
I been a street fighter fan since street fighter 2  my cousin since the original probably where he is his best at playing. I saw the trailer and it looked terrible and the fact that they wanted to spotlight the new guys over the originals is walk. my cousin hated itsoo disappointed by it. thats sucks  anyways keep up the awesome work love your videos. hopefully we get a cooking channel from you fingers crossed one can wish
Im not a huge fan of calling some outfits the  stripper look .  rather than covering people up to make them more  mature   we should be expanding fashion so revealing outfits aren t stigmatized as  slutty.
sf fanbase  can you please keep ken awesome looking sf4 series  sure you can!!!sf5 series   more like  fu  ken!sf6 series  sure you can!!smash bros series  how d ya do ken ! !  d
we will see how woke things get when we get some storyline info is released. I expect we will see something like perhaps a resurrected bison in a female body with his usual male voice to add to the confusion for the new generation. like they did in sfv with seth. giving him a female body and keeping a male voice.  in guilty gear  testament looks like a pretty woman wearing a goth style dress  but has a mans voice in the english dub.  if poison is still in this game  expect some lines about freedom to be what you wanna be. even though poison is confirmed to be a male to female   I use my own imagination when playing the game and she is all woman to me. I remember way before the woke age there were even hints my fav character zangief was gay but again  I dont play games to wanna see what the characters crave to do with their non drawn in private parts.
I hadn t seen these designs before. these look so awesome Im so hyped for sf6.
sindel was the only curvy lady on mk 11. edit  worrying who is  truly saved  can easily get into that pesky judging area. not to mention pride. just be careful with that part of the faith.
Im more concerned if they re to release a full game from the start this time.
I love your goku top!! I am probably more team vegeta but love dragon ball z and super
I think its strange to be even care if its  woke  in whatever that term is supposed to mean to this situation. the characters have been mostly  from the looks of it  dressed in more street style attire. only chun-lI from the picture seems to be styled up in her normal attire  but now her leggings are blue and not brown or a thin nylon mesh you could partially see through. granted her alternate costumes would have her legs shown  and usually this series has plenty of alternate costumes as dlc. there may be a couple unlockable ones  but overall the designs I think look great and exciting. the characters have a fresh look to them and honestly I think sf5 s character art and design was overall pretty bad  so this is a far step up from that imo.
when you look at them you can still tell who is who. wokeness tends to take something and change itso much its unrecognizable. I like the new designs.
its been a while since I played street fighter Im excited to play this one
I have no problem with the change and Im glad they also aged up the characters  this is hem moving the gap instead making them look young.
these new outfits are not too bad
thiiiis tra s and swj s have made itso we question everything  a gay character  is it woke  black character  is it woke  10 years when I saw the  kiss  in the last of us dlc I thought nothing of it. if that happened today God I would think it was pandering to the letter community. this is why I hate this current climate those people are making art suffer and while I refuse to support tra sjw entertainment sometimes even I cant tell if it is pandering to them.
@fried chicken  the people who made the claim that  everything is political  get really upset when other people presume they have some sort of ulterior motive for practically everything they put out.
this isn t being woke tho
@fried chicken  or move on
@chrisbg99  true
@kuggacourage gx  thats my point. I was pointing out the deliberate attempt to transform everything has made it natural for many of us to second-guess every change is made due to ideology. in this case its not a woke attempt to reform the appearances  but our first instinct is to assume that is the reason for the change because it happens so often. thats the point I was making - the culture war has made us paranoid.
@madkingstow  well-said. I just want to be left alone and play video games.
@madkingstow  you d only get  paranoid  about situations like these if you are a regressive  i.e conservative or right wing
@ lucI    we all want progress  but if youre on the wrong road  progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road  in that case  the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive.  - cs lewis
views brah controversey make views its all media click bait all over again
@fried chicken  or just stop asking questions  and start appreciating gay characters  black people  strong women  etc.stop thinking.
@madkingstow  I think we are in the right direction with the  woke  stuff. even if the term  woke  is incorrect  more like  empathetic
@kara  really  you look at society today and think people seem happier  more content  and get along better than they did 50 years ago  yes we ve corrected some societal injustices  but the pendulum has swung too far and now everyone seems angry  depressed  anxious  vindictive and selfish.
@madkingstow  cope
@michele pietro  Im glad you understood my messaging  that bad politics exists
@madkingstow  at least more people get good representation. nowadays  female protagonists in video games tend to be less and less hypersexualized.and trust me  women do appreciate that.
@kara  youre speaking for some women  but not all. not this youtuber  my wife or my best friend. they prefer sexy characters. I think we should have both options though.
@madkingstow  thats why I dont listen to them. I think they are not well informed.
@kara  how sexist of you  p
@kara  yeah thats a dangerous way of thinking. youre just basically telling people to blindly consume or blindly follow with out questions.
@ruby king  yes
@mike pc  centrist spotted lmao
of course its on purpose but there s a reason to contest wokeism instead of being quiet... I remember when sf alpha was released and chun-lI had a totally different outfit  was to p_ss people off  no  it was part of the story  she was much younger in alpha and maybe in a lower rank in the force. context matters and wokeism wants to get rid of it.
@ redacted   my brother in Christ the reason chun looks different in alpha and in this game  and what will probably be the reason why cammy looks different  is because they re out of the icpo millitary  respectfully  since  y know  bison s dead  the one reason they even joined these orgs
@mike pc  cope harder
same recycled comment for over 5 years now. jsus stop with the agendas. if its obvious its obvious and you should call it out but this is nothing. marketing is all that matters . aka money is all that matters.
I feel this
@kara  thats a bad thing
@madkingstow  heck senran kagura fanvase had a lot of women thatseries the girls were sexizile
@kara  what do you mean nowadays  its always been the case. since the 90s when a lot of games started focusing on characters. off the top of my head from what I remember  playing when I was young.... let s just say a period of say  95- 00s. I could name a bunch of ff  but I ll go with just one -aeris yuffie from ff7. -jill valentine and claire redfield from re 1 2.-heather mason from sh3-shodan from system shock  antagonist -regina from dino crisis.  Imean thats 27 years back within a 5 year period. these were also fairly big titles at the time  not some niche small one that only sold a small amount. re sh were the two biggest survival horror games  ff the biggest rpg  system shock was revolutionary and went on to create bioshock etc.there s tons of story driven protagonists antagonists that you dont play as such as jaina proudmoore  sylvanas   who are still important to this day in wow   sarah kerrigan from starcraft. zelda  princess peach  who aren t hypersexualized either.I could go on  but I think you get the point. while there is also a lot of female protagonists who are also sexy such as lara croft  rayne from bloodrayne  sure. but women are sexy in real life as well  and a lot of women like to present themselves as sexy. if women in real life can represent themselves as sexy  I think its also fine for female representation in games as well to do it.the problem is that people want to look back on the past with feminist rose tinted glasses and pretend that every time there s a either a new game with a female protagonist  ot one who s not sexy  they are somehow revolutionary  when they are just reinventing the wheel. it isn t new in the slightest or uncommon as touted. its just that the media and activists like to harp on about itso much and paint an inaccurate picture of the past  unless you were there  you ll take them at their word.
@enterthefray  you dont have a good point of view on the issue.
@kara  thatsounds like a cope response.
@enterthefray  Im still right.I know there has always been strong female charcters  but not so much in video games. so here is the feminist point   we want more  and not characters that have to depend of men. its important to show that women can perform without men.you know  its kinda like captain marvel  she s very strong  and doesnt need men to cover her.yeah  I know lara croft is a strong character  but  you exactly know why her breasts were like that. and you know thatsome gamers cried about wokism when the reboot released in 2013.but honestly  Im scared about these gamers   they cry about woke stuff when they see women that look like... real women. does that mean these guys have extremely high standards  and that even real women are too ugly for them   I dont understand.
@kara  I provided several examples of a lot of female characters around at the same era as lara croft in the mid 90s  who didn t have big breasts and who weren t hypersexualized. if feminists have to ignore the reality of what happened and only zone in on lara croft and pretend she was the only female representative or type of representative at the time  they are creating an inaccurate picture to push a narrative. one which wasn t true. yes  lara croft existed. yes  she was sexy. but so did heather mason exist. she wasn t sexy  and a fairly realistic portrayal of a woman. there was also plenty of female protagonists around at the same time who weren t sexy.additionally  just to defend lara croft a bit here. so what if she was sexy  there are a lot of women who are just as sexy if not more than lara croft  who are also highly competent irl as well.  men are going to pay attention to her looks  but that doesnt mean thats all she was.the women in todays era in video games dont look like  real  women. most look androgynous and they remove a lot of femininity from female characters. big breasts  despite plenty of women having them irl  are considered problematic. as if real women with big breasts dont exist. can you imagine being a big breasted women in todays era and seeing women with big breasts be toned down to have small ones because having big breasts is considered misogynistic and problematic its prudish.also  Im not seeing much representation of baldy overweight men like myself on screen in an effort to be considered  real . most men depicted in video games are either very lean and pretty looking  or muscular and hunkish. I dont really care to be fair  but its a point nonetheless.
@enterthefray  I knew it  you kinda want to complain about the issue without understanding everything.1  yeah I know there wasn t only lara croft  stop thinking we are dishonest. but I dont remember any other one who was as famous as her.2  youre very problematic by saying thatsome women are  androgynous   also by saying some traits are feminine  and others are masculine. its not very 2022 ish.3  yeah we know that women with big breasts exist. a lot of feminists are like that  and there is no issue about this.4  we just freakin ask to stop bodyshaming women becauser they dont have big breasts  and stop by they way creating a vision of women in media where they do have to have this attribute to be considered  sexy .what is misogynistic and problematic is   always by default creating women with big breasts  and considering this as  the standard .5  every woman is beautiful is sexy  all women are queens  thats the mantra. no matter if they re cis  trans  tall  thin  flat  etc etc.so yeah  lara is sexy and skillfull. like women in real life  even if they dont have the same traits.I personally think mma women like ronda rousey are very beautiful  but do you think they would have been considered  sexy  in a 90 s video game  6  aaaah  classic argument of  and men boohooo you wanna see fat men   they do exist  but indeed in media we dont like to see fat people  which is fatphobia. some of them do exist like coach in left 4 dead 2.but okay  if you want to talk about an other subject  fatphobia  there it is   we dont have enough fat characters in video games. thats it  youre happy now   can you let us continue our fight
@kara  -not many video game characters were as huge as lara croft. thats a ridiculous bar youre setting  for anybody. Im not even sure I canthink of any male characters in that era that were as popular or iconic as lara croft was.that doesnt mean that there wasn t any female protagonists who weren t popular. it just means your bar is unrealistically high. Imentioned that re1 2 and sh3 were the most popular and highest selling survival horror games in the genre out there at that time. all 3 have female protags. thats doesnt count because they weren t as popular as lara croft  come on now  thats not an actual argument.-  its current year  isn t an an actual argument either. there is such a thing as masculine and feminine traits. just because you ideology doesnt like it  doesnt mean its not true.- what are you talking about  did heather mason have big breasts  did yuffie  did aeris  did jill valentine have big breasts   there already existed  the standard  where plenty of women didn t have big breasts. what youre asking for already exists.the problem is the inaccurate painting of video game history that feminists do  which youre doing just now. youre trying to sell this narrative thatsimply isn t true about female video gaming characters. Im pointing out plenty of female characters where  the standard  didn t apply from 25  years back. I cant go back in time and rewrite history  so dont you think the problem is what youre saying isn t correct  its either that or I have a time machine and did this to prove you wrong.- no  not all women are sexy. not all men are hot either. that is an idealism that isn t true to reality and sounds like naivety. spend 5 years dating and you ll find out just how wrong this statement is.- lastly  hold up here. if youre going to say that women are unrealistically portrayed  that means we also need to take a look at the men as well by comparison. if men are being realistically portrayed but women aren t  you d have a double standard. in which  you would be correct to say that its unfair what is happening to women in the video game market.but to do that  you need to take a look at what s happening to men. so why are you acting like  aaand men boohoo   I need to make comparisons to men to see if a double standard is being committed. unfortunately for you  there is no double standard. men dont get any more realistic treatment of looks than women do in video gaming. so I dont see where the complaint is here.
@enterthefray  okay  you spend a lot of time countering my arguments.but... did you ever read feminist studies about the hypersexualization of women in media   or in general   because in my case  I did. their arguments are relentless  trust me.also  itstill is problematic to think by  this trait is masculine  this trait is feminine ... because what about men who for example enjoy makeup   what about woman who have facial hair   what about non-binary people
@kara  Ive read feminist studies. but as Ive pointed out to you several times here  they paint an inaccurate representation of females in video game history. they are cherry picking examples thatsupport their thesis about hyper sexualization  and ignoring the ones that go against what they say. the end result being  a slanted view of history that is inaccurate to what happened. also  because they only ever focus on one side  they are incredibly biased and ignorant to how men were portrayed. like the example I provided for you  its hard to complain about the representation of women being unrealistic  if the same thing is happening to men. there s no double standard being committed if thats the case. but they wont know that  unless they also investigate it from the other side. but they wont  because they aren t interested in painting an accurate representation. only a biased narrative that pushes feminism.but plenty of people  including myself  played games back then. knew what was big  what wasn t. it annoys me to no end to see characters like heather mason get glossed over just to push a narrative.
@kara  just as an example  I googled and clicked on the first article titled  miss-leading characters  the hyper-sexualization of females in video gamesthe article discusses lara croft  quiet from mgsv and bayonetta. no mention of heather mason  senua from hellblade  senua s sacrifice  sylvanas from wow  aloy or the other many examples you can pull from  that aren t sexualized. this is what Imean by cherry picking. this is not an honest viewpoint or accurate representation. its slanted and distorted to push a narrative.
@enterthefray  because the examples you are quoting are good.but here is the point   we want more characters like them  and no more bayonetta or quiet.
@kara  what s wrong with having both  we ve had both all along. look at this way do women in real life like to sexualize themselves  do some women love the attention it gets them  and do men like looking  if the answer to those is yes  then what s the problem with presenting women like this in video games as well  if its good enough for real life  there s no harm in having it in game.its not the only portrayal of women. never has been  either. but articles like the above like to present a very slanted view that it is the case.
@enterthefray  because male gaze  made by men for men  is the issue.women can do whatever they want with their own body.
@kara  thats not an issue  thats marketing  lol. the same thing happens in romance novels with the representation of men. right down to their looks on the front cover  to the descriptions of them in the books themselves. there s a reason 50 shades of grey was so popular.- insanely rich and handsome man falls for an average joe run of the mill women.isn t that written largely by women  for women
@enterthefray  some women have internalized misogyny.plus  dont forget that we live in a patriarchy.
@kara  so when men do it to women  its the male gaze and problematic towards women  but when women do it to men  its internalized misogyny and problematic towards women must be nice to have a canned response that no matter which answer is given  women are always the victims in a scenario. the doublethink you just displayed there not to come to terms with the reality that both men and women will create media that appeals to them and its not an issue was impressive  I ll grant you that.
@enterthefray  you just lack of understanding for the whole situation.women are not always victims  but you need to understand how oppressions work.
@kara  I understand your beliefs. I discuss against them all the time. its not the lack of understanding thats the issue here.its that you dont realize youre indoctrinated and not every answer will fit neatly into your pre-packaged pov.Im poking holes in your beliefs  youre just not interested in listening to them.its a fair critique to point out for example  while men may make media with sexy women that appeals to them in video games  what you call the male gaze   so do women.women focus more on erotica novels for it  but they still do it. the way that men look on the covers  to the way they are characterized in the books themselves  is all to appeal to the female pov.feminists gloss over this and act like it only happens to women and act like its an issue.the reality is there is no double standard being committed here. men make female characters that appeal to males  and females do the same back. they just use different media to do so.so if both sexes do this to each other  there is no double standard. its just a reality.
@enterthefray  and yet  you spend your time fighting these people  instead of burying your ego.
the worst part is that  many  miself and many have been saying that for years  upon years  men have to be adonis  shirtless and rip  as women are more and more cover  they have less and less detial  Imean look tifa in the new final fantasy  not to mention chun lI for me is the first female that made an impression  and now  she look so bad  what happen to her  also the idea is good  the idea is good but all these really kill the game  for me  street figther 4 was the last street figther  5 was bad  and was an agonizing cry  and that was it
@krysnha  pls go outside
@kara  ok
bro it is about a new era. move on. and grow up
@kuggacourage gx  aww my opinion struck a nerve  how about no the game looks garbage  last street fighter did the same and when it came out wasn t good until a crap load of updates. street fighter fans love the originals and thats why I literally saw comments where people dont like it. so how about you grow up and move on if you dont like someone s opinion of a crappy trailer
kind of proving his point arc.
yeah  thats a pretty poor way to look at it  because thats the same exact phrasing male feminists use to demonize sexy female characters.
practically speaking   cammy s og outfit actually is one of the more sensible outfits for a fighter. less to grab. in fact  one of the biggest gripes you could have are her giant pigtails because they defeat the purpose. thats the point where you have to remind yourself that its a game and its not supposed to be realistic.
it already was until 4-5 years agothis is censorship
u literally not even helping the issue. u literally advocating for more revealing look. meaning u want them to look like strippers  they dont need to be sexualized.
@mike pc  lies
@mike pc  what about poison  who was an actual stripper  and I believe poison was trans as well. not trying to make a big deal about it  just pointing out that there is no  stripper uniform . been to plenty clubs. only ever saw 3 strippers with pasties lol.
frankly some of the outfits in older mk games were definitely stripper-like  and sadly they overcorrected in the recent game and went to the other extreme making all the female characters outfits bland and covered up  while hypocritically leaving many of the the males shirtless .and stripper doesnt necessarily mean slutty  it just means that the outfit belongs in a strip-club environment not in any combat adventuring action scenario that you want people to take seriously in any way  also like melonie said less clothes results in characters having less identity  its just a bunch of leather strips  which means less chance to give characters an outfit that gives them a unique look identity  comics from the 90s had similar stripper outfits as well that look ridiculous   Im all for revealing sexy outfits  but put some effort into them instead of just slapping two strips of leather on the character and then calling it an outfit.finally  with every rule there are few exceptions  one of the very few female characters that own that kind of  stripper  outfit and it works with them well is vampirella  since she is also a vampire and seduction is part of her  arsenal  it fits her well  but that doesnt mean that it would work with most other female characters.
@ascendantstoic  it goes both ways.  the areas of the body an outfit exposes can be just as characterized as the bells and whistles they do wear.  in my fantasy  I like the idea thatsomeone can dress a bitskimpy in combat.  it goes right along with hot dudes with giant swords.  I dont want said outfits to only be considered for strippers  as I d honestly love to see them used in other situations.
@wurstsemmel64  its sucks to have a trans character  tell me more about you.
@michele pietro  tbh  I dont care about his explanation. his sentence was already too much.
wouldn t really call a leotard practical leo  especially going up againts people with knives and guns.
not exactly otakudaikun. also really shouldn t bother you people refer to them as stripper outfits unless you have low opinion of strippers.
@fighting media lounge  pretty much everyone calling it a stripper outfit is implying its problematic or demeaning though.
@otakudaikun  only if you feel that way yourself.  if you dont look down on strippers  then people comparing certain outfits to strippers isn t a problem.
uh...poison has never been confirmed to be trans. the final fight creator came up with a bs excuse story to explain away why they changed all the poison characters in final fight to male characters for the global release.basically  capcom didn t think a brawler where you punch women would go over well in america  so they changed all the women to men. thats it.poison is all woman and has never been  male  except in censored parts of the world outside japan.
not actually played guilty gear but to my knowledge testament is nonbinary  but they just have a more feminine style of dress  but has some clear more masculine elements mixed in with their fashion too. as nonbinary they coulda just found a voice actor thatsuited the delivery style they were going for since its not really important what the va s sex or gender were. Imean you get a lot of voice actors playing characters of a different gender pretty commonly in cartoons and such  albiet usually women playing younger men boys  so eh. its still not that unusual.
the entire reason bison had cammy around was to use her body as his new host. testament since around overture has been more gender neutral
@gamephreak5  final fight lore is different than street fighter lore.in street fighter poison is trans.
@sanguinaryblade  no such thing as nonbinary
I care if its  woke . everything  woke  turns to shit!
@gamephreak5  no.
Im sure the classic outfits are dlc. chun lI is my main and she looks alright. I do like her classic the most. sf5 version was perfection.overall  the game looks quite good.
chun-lI and cammy look great. I dont mind their new designs at all!
the wise man once said  if your heart is clean   you no need a shower
last year some hacker leaked capcom s internal data  among the data was something called   politically correct business strategy    thats how it was actually called.in it were internal guidelines on how to design female characters so that they wouldnt be too sexualized and that they should be about as revealing as the male ones.what ever changes can bee now seen in sf6 are a result of that new capcom s strategy.they also take a lot of feedback from the fgc community  which is dominated by male feminists who hate sexy female character designs.I just hope the more revealing previous outfits will still be in the game as unlockables or dlc content.
I could swear some characters aren t dressed to fight  but to the carnival in copacabana.
super agree on these new designs! especially cammie  although I can understand being upset its not the iconic look ! I think the biggest difference  like you said  is that they a little more covered up but not looking unflattering. if it was woke the girls would all look like skinnier men!also there s definitely a balance between  rules  of Christianity and the relationship you have with Christ. I d definitely research and pray for discernment in this. very cool youre talking about this stuff so openly!
Im not a Christian or anything really  but I dont mind the Christian talk at all. I kind of like it. very refreshing.
...they just clocked out of their stripper job to go fight.
I dig the style  it has a urban aesthetic which is very welcome in my books. plus its capcom and there is no way they will leave out the traditional costumes  they will milk the fans for sure by making them dlc. my girl jurI is there and chun lI looks older and much more mature and love the outfit. she is still extra thick which is a good thing but she now moves with style and grace which matches her age and love it. I overall think the roster is well balanced when it comes to og characters and new characters.
mortal kombat x and mortal kombat 11 though do have their klassic outfits for the ladies if you dont like the newer looks. so their kinda exempt from the whole  woke agenda  because their giving options for both sides. just like the resident evil remakes did  they gave choices for claire and jill  remake or classic .
the new style looks a lot like streets of rage 4  to me at least.
even if some people dont like the covered up designs shown here  you know capcom is gonna release many dlc  including bikinI beach outfits for thatsweet sweet monetization.
I cannot wait to play it  in 2023 I cantry anything. so  bring it on
we dont equate a lack of clothing to making someone more attractive in the real world so it would make sense to keep the same is it well put together standard for a more immersive experience.
dont worry mleonie cammy still has her classic costume through the official trailer and leaks so its more of an nostalgia costume option just like in sf5.
capcom based ryu s sash on buddhist monks
I dont have any preference on the street fighter character designs  just posting to help the algorithm and to say I love the dbz shirt.
you scared me there for a minute  I like the designs.
the new outfit is good for the game  because itshow us grow in the story. street fighter need to move forward  cause the prequel is too much
I dont think its woke at all.chun-lI s got massive cake and the tight leggings highlight it  cammy s outfit looks sexy as hell  reminds me of blue mary from fatal fury king of fighters   and the new  female abel  is showing her thong.people are looking too much into this. twitter wars have poisoned their minds. everyone s gotta touch grass. lmao
to expand  they mentioned the last of us 2 game as a formula to follow. fast  succint and to the point of what s to come. seems with the recent leaks there might be some rogue capcom employee disenfranchised with the plans outlooked for the future.
ok but I doubt that. might be made up just for tea.also female character dont need to be sexualized at all. simple. they are characters. their personality is the important thing nor their bodies
@kuggacourage gx  the leaked documents across twitter and other webpages were often taken down via dmca by capcom representatives but still can be found if looked hard enough. so.  what do you mean with  ok but I doubt that    tea   have you searched and read for the leaks to talk if its dubious in the first place
@kuggacourage gx  the term   sexualization   is dubious anyway  since its predominantly used by radical feminists to attack any female character design they dont like.they dont employ any nuance in their criticism so even relatively safe looking designs often get labeled as sexualized.male characters get sexualized aswell by radical feminist standards  but they pretty much never bother to critcise that.there s nothing wrong with sexy characters  be it male or female  but sadly these days its mostly only male characters who get to be that  while female characters increasingly get toned down puritan style.
@kuggacourage gx  couldn t you say that about the male characters  look ho revealing some of them are.
uhh  not saying that there aren t male feminists in the fgc. Im sure there are. but who exactly in the fgc would you call a male feminist
@kuggacourage gx  nope.
@jcg s lounge  mostly people at the managerial level of the tournaments. remember how evo cut off a stream when japanese promo models bounced their boobs on stage to mimic doa the   pros   themselves are usually more subtle about their displeasure of fan servicy outfits.
male feminists who hate sexy female character designs first of all  a man cant be feminist by definition  because he belongs to the people who harass women. at least he can be an ally.second of all   we dont hate sexy characters. I like women. but I hate hypersexualization and objectification  because at the end of the day it hurts women irl.and finally   men simply cant be victims of sexualization with the same level as women  I precise. why   because patriarchy.and you think my thoughts are too much political for a video game   but you know that politics are defining our society since humanity started creating groups  right  every video game has a sort of political message  even the smallest one  even in super mario bros.
@charming peasant  so now I hope you understand better.
@kara  can you explain what is   hypersexualization   and how it compares to sexualization  you seem to not differentiate between the two.and when does a character become   objectified   exactly do you truly believe that classic street fighter s cammy hurts women irl the   everything is political   vibe Im getting here suggests a severe case of indoctrination.
@charming peasant  classic cammy is still in the game if you didn t know by now  it was actually leaked in a vid the same day the character art leaked.
unlikely. look at what happened to mortal kombat 11. they did not even give you an option of choosing sexy outfits for the female characters  and when they released the so called  klassic  female skins they were censored and the bottom part was made to look like they were wearing a diaper.
@cobalt-snake  classic cammy is still in the game as it was...so not its not like mk at all.  capcom makes a lot of money off costumes unlike nrs  so they wouldn t even do that with that alone.
@charming peasant  dont argue with kara.  she doesnt speak politics.  she is a child   if not mentally  and she speaks oppression of men as some demented form revenge.  take away what men enjoy.  attractive women   shrink chun lI s breasts   heroic confident men   make ken a divorced  beaten down loser. .   seriously its the same thing they did to luke and han. and even she hulk.
@raymkkkk  yes but cammy has small breasts.  the top tier of   overtly sexulaized  for the woke are larg breasts.    shrunk chun lI s  add to that what they plan to do to ken s image.  another mark of the woke is to depower confident male heroes. ken a bit of a womanizer  cool confident heroe with a blond super model wife is now divorced and broken.  not to dissimilar from what they did to luke skywalker and han solo.    if not for these things you could deny the woke but these make it very clear coupled with the document.
@kara  what message does super mario bro s have if you know
meanwhile sf6 is still full of sexy characters  male and female alike. I cannot take you people seriously. you are acting as if these characters are now  ugly  because they show slightly less skin.
@daisuke gori   I want my video game characters to be at their best at all times and never hit any low points in their lives to grow as a person. I hate interesting stories!!
@theo bell  who is   you people    I just shared my concerns based off of capcom s own corporate guidelines.of course the more conservative outfits wont make the characters downright ugly looking  though some of the characters faces are kinda uncanny valley looking due to the art style change.
sorry but as someone who actually read those documents there is nothing about it that is about removing sexuality. the vast majority of it is just dont add racist stereotypes and allow women to have the same customization options as men
@joedatius  then you are not able to read then. just dont be blind.
@joedatius  resident evil 3 remake s director publically decried   sexualization   of jill in the original game  hence the drastic change to her default outfit.he also went out of his way to censor the classic outfit by changing her skirt to a skort.so their actions contradict what you have stated.
the days of unlocking costumes by beating challenges or completing the game at higher difficulties are mostly gone and replaced by dlc in crazy ways  aren t they
@lotus petal  yep  basic features must be purchased lol
lol no they didn t  the supposed jill classic outfit isn t the classic one  d
good assessment of the new outfits for sf6.you lost me after 11 minutes in though.
just leave modding support open  and we ll fix any chun-lI wokeness
keep it up
I guess maybe the point could be made that they did  but tbh I dont have an issue with any of these and they will probably take this as a chance to re-sell classic cosmetics so idk
just leak cammy with your classic costume and boy oh boy the super move she rocks
about the stripper look   I dont mind it because superheroes have the skin tight look so why not fighting games  but there is nothing capcom is doing here that tekken didn t do way back in the 1990s.  there should definitely be an option to buy the classic costumes. guile was a lot cooler with less clothing  basic tank top with fatigues and boots  because his muscles was the appeal for many to choose him.  the old rule is  more options is better than less options .  king of fighters is obviously there main rival right now.  the 2d single plane 1 vs 1 fighters  in king of fighters you got lot of sexy anime style character yurI and maI would be obvious example  but alongside that you got the stylish people who live in big metropolitan city and shopped at the most expensive places to go and fight people.  I do prefer the classic versions of the old characters to the kof-ising versions because to me a fighter would never put unecessary clothing on their body during a serious fight.  in fact at the start of every modern sf game the fighters would be seen taking off the excessive clothing. some examples include m.bison throwing off his cape   cammy taking off her red cloak  street fighter alpha games   zangief throwing cape off etc  the excessive clothing only gets in the way. what I would like to see is a return of final fight and they make a 1 vs 1 game that is tag based. the idea is you would have the traditional walk along beat em up section and when facing a boss you go into street fighter 1 vs 1 mode after you beat up his minions.  I loved the tag mode in the psp port of street fighter alpha 3  called  street fighter alpha 3 max   and would like a final fight game based on this.  would it compete with sf   no. it would have bulk of the game be about taking on hordes of thugs. the emphasis is style and comboes and efficiency like the dynstary warriors games. the bosses would be able to do advanced moves like dodging  blocking and countering so you would need to practice but unlike sf you would have ways to level up the characters to brute force your way past them.
I call itsteroid fighter now and how dare they cover-up chun lI s classic iconic look  which is really reminding of what s been done to modern lara croft. the best sf designs and animations are still from 2  alpha series and 3  -
I prefer stylization over  realism
the scantily clad women in mortal kombat made sense to me design wise because the game paid homage to b-movies and kung fu action flicks.  outworld is a mad max  conan the barbarian type world.  that wouldn t make sense for the street fighter franchise
maybe they re going woke more slowly.
chun-lI is still hot - and honestly  her outfit is much more realistic in regards to her cultural background and what I d expect if she was starring in a shaw brothers kung fu flick.  of course if they have alternate outfits for her  thats ok too.
in response to one of those comments  I d say that a guy going by the name of shaI linne said something along the lines of  you cant know Jesus without knowing doctrine  but you can know doctrine without knowing Jesus. you can research that further by listening to his sermon on the essence of Christianity  which you can still find  hopefully . also  the guy is one of the most lit rap artists I know in recent times - you should check out his work  I cannot commend him enough
cammy got leaked  she still has her og outfit. no worries
splatoon fighter 6 ! I hope we can unlock some jet set radio character!  I was feeling the new style but then all that color splash started to p__sed me off lol capcom was aiming at urban style but it feels like pepto bismol art. I know attention deficit disorder is a thing but too flashy for me...chun lI s thighs are in the shape of turkey legs.  and she suddenly decided to become really chinese  meanwhile ryu has the same cartoony face...   and she had breast reduction... I ain t no doctor but... hey  maybe its botox and paper clips holding her face! dont know if totally woke but they are definitely changing unnecessary stuff on purpose.
chun lI actually looks like something she would wear in the street.
sf was cool when it wasn t tied to e sports. when it got tied to esports is when it became a niche title.  king of fighters is considered the more stylish fighter of the series because of the speed of being able to rush down people. where as sf is middle weight to heavy weights speed.  you must make a more tactical and less reflexive response    the pinnacle of sf was street fighter 3 third strike. notice how in street fighter 3 each character is genuinely unique in feel and moves  this shows good game design so players get a cross section of different playstyles. later games were guided more by fan service and people who didn t understand that  less is more . ie more characters usually result in poorer balance. super street fighter 2 turbo is considered a good example of good balance since each new character was carefully considered before adding to the roster and then play-tested to make sure they didn t suffer from being too powered or too underpowered - nowadays the capcom of today expects the tournament players to discover this for them rather than it being well balanced by capcom themselves. some people believe this is a form of exploitation because its not the job of pro-e-sports players to tell capcom how to make their games - they should do that job and know what is wrong or right with the current roster they created before releasing the characters to the market in broken form.for me I will wait until the full version of sf6 is out because if you buy it early you are telling capcom  I dont care if I get a finished product. I am a capcom fanboy who just buys anything with street fighter in the name .  when street fighter 5 came out it was a mess because the game had barebones content and felt unfinished compared to rival fighting series like tekken which always gave you story modes  all the characters at once and felt polished as a home console game. this is a sign that the sf series has lost its budget because capcom obviously doesnt see it as a major franchise in their lineup anymore  at least not as much as they did back in the 90-late 90s  and  cant afford a triple a title s budget   so they skimp on what they perceive as  the less important  features for the hardcore fans who only worry about how it feels in online competitive play but dont mention its shortcomings due to desperation to see something new in the street fighter franchise. and who can blame them  its the most vocal community compared to the normies who just play casually. but the side effect of cutting corners and rushing the game out for the fanboys who dont understand how to design a good game is that it creates distrust by the rest of the game community who has to review street fighter based only on its merits in relation to other fighting games which are highly polished and feel finished and complete.  nobody want to hate street fighter but when you dont include every mode that every other fighting game franchise includes by default  then a value argument can be made that you as a customer are being ripped off by what street fighter 5 offered on release. it means the reviewer despite liking the core of the game now has to rate the game down lower by giving it a worse score because of laziness by capcom to release a complete game with all the modes available on release day. this problem of rushing out a street fighter game before its ready for the normies who like sf  began when the focus of street fighter was on the competitive player and devoted fanboys of capcom  not on the general audience who plays fighting games from many different companies and will feel ripped off by how little content exists.  recently king of fighter got rebooted and it is good. so perhaps this will be a kick in the butt to capcom to focus on making quality street fighter not just listening to existing fanboys and only focusing on the competitive e-sports gamers.  who are being used to balance test all the games for them lol   I hope capcom have learned from the street fighter 5 release of the past and delay this title as long as possible to ensure it is not an incomplete mess. I wont buy a barebones version of the game.
did you have to mention pizza like that! now I really want one  its been months and there s a great gourmet pizzeria only a block away lol.
as well as their backstories and where they come from as some of the female characters come from earth realm while the other female characters come from netherealm.
you convinced me.now I want onions!Imean yeah  they re hot and caramelized and sitting on bbq sauce and topped with bacon and cheese and all wrapped up in a burger but......onions sound good right now!
cammy is giving off those strong android 18 mommy vibes. I still say damn on that
go play guilty gear then dude
while mk was inspired by kung fu and scI fI flicks their story is original snd the reason the female ninjas looked sexier with not much clothing is because edenians dress very sexy yet elegantly. ie kitana  millena  sindel etc etc and sonya was actually more realistic with less clothes because if you take a ufc female fighter they re dressed very similarly to how sonya used to look. japanese typically dont like the woke or more covered up nonsense so im sure they ll have classic outfits that were sexiwr like chun-lis and cammy old look.
and too  her outfit gives her a mentor appearance!
everybody looks great in these designs
as a long time street fighter fan and chun-lI fangirl  I dont mind the changes to her especially since it looks like they didn t touch those thick thighs or that booty lol however I am a little disappointed that from what Ive seen she no longer has her black spike bracelets. I do hope that her classic outfit is something unlockable. I know a lot of people dont like the way her face looks but considering how long street fighter has been around I like it as I think it looks like a more mature   older version of chun-li. Ive only seen one trailer  and only because my son insisted  as I dont like too many spoilers on upcoming things. I can however understand people s knee jerk reactions expecting the worst what with all the wokies trying to push their stuff on everyone.
I like the design.. looks alpha like
I think the real question is does chun-lI still have man hands
I have mixed feelings I think they gave them outfits because part of the game is like this  open world  thing. but fighting...watch mma...how much clothes do the male and female fighters wear  very little. maybe they should have had 2 outfits....one for fights  one for open world.
I would say its soft censored. yes  it was done before the game came out and yes the characters are still attractive  but it is still most likely a design change influenced by the current climate and also the strict rules of the brodcasted tournaments. street fighter gently edited down things in their last game too. so again  I would say its not extreme but was likely changed so as not to offend  which is still technically censorship.
jurI looks amazing
the only thing I noticed is chunlI dress is too light.... the design has dark blue parts
melonie  regarding  balanced diet   I have remembered something interesting. a youtube video makes a comparison between american and japanese diet and eating habits. japanese eat a large variety of vegetables  fish  fruit for dessert  and down it with green tea. and you should know american diet  heavy on meat and soft drinks  or so the video claims . claims japanese are healthier with longer life. I dont remember the title nor do I know how accurate it is  but could be something of interest for you to look into. otherwise it may not be the food pyramid that makes us fat  but fast food and sugar based desserts  snaks  and drinks. feel free to debunk the arguments.
6 28 its kind of funny  if you pause it around here when you say thatshe looks chinese  she looks a lot like you.
personally  I really like this art style but Im very casual when it comes to fighting games. as long as they dont virtue signal heavily I ll probably pick up this game. cammy is bae
its cool yo. first day buy type shit
Im not a Christian or religious at all melonie  but I do enjoy the religious takes.
Im down with the new art style character designs  overall they seem pretty fitting. I just wish capcom would go with like a hand drawn game instead of that pseudo-3d sprite look of the last couple of games. something like what was done with streets of rage 4  that game s gorgeous.I hope this game does well  as I am a huge street fighter fan  well capcom   snk fighter fan in general. my first genesis game was sf2  champion edition. I played the crap out of these things in the arcades. Ive recently been bingeing on japanese saturn games  so in the past few months Ive picked up sf zero 2  samuraI shodown 4  vampire hunter   vampire savior  darkstalkers     dead or alive. speaking of that franchise... its taken quite a hit in recent years. so sad.as an aside  capcom vs snk 2 is like one of the best fighting games ever. thankfully I have a copy on both ps2   xbox  just need to track down a gamecube copy now.
yes I agree with chun like she looks great
let s be real  capcom will sell bikinI outfits in a future dlc. besides that  wait until they release poison as a playable char.....
chun-lI has some really developed thighs. have mercy!
you pronounced ryu correctly sub !
Im loving cammy s new design!
I like the new outfits  its just the new body types I dont like...
I disagree with you about your last sentence   its not about pushing stuff on everyone  its making the right decisions for a safe space  let s say
@kara  and you are welcome to disagree. its not realistic to turn everything into a  safe space . and from what I have seen woke culture seeks to make everything bland and uninteresting and usually is happy to do it by force  for example badgering game developers or anyone in general with threats of boycotts and cancellation. and at the very least half of these type of people dont even buy the product that they are trying to force changes on. I noticed that my speech to text changed some words so I went back and changed them there at the end. Im all for trying to make everyone feel included but using threats and cancellation is the wrong way to go about it and that is what I have seen the most of.
there is really no way to confirm or even assume anything like that unless you just wanna make conclusions without reason. from everything they showed its that their designs are influenced by street fighters past rather then some sort of  climate
everytime somebody says its censorship  Im just going to mention jurI  og costumes returning seemingly on launch  and butt physics
lol no she doesnt.
asian countries have more skinny-fat people  their bodyfat percentage is still quite high they just have low muscle mass. thats not healthy either. better than rampant obesity buy meat is not the culprit for that.
@melonie mac go boom   I saw a video by  let s ask shogo your japanese friend in kyoto  and he made a video about how japan has one of the worst processed foods.
they are not more healthy  and small on top of that. look around the world at tall and powerful peoples  you find a diet heavy in meat  milk and cheese. some of the mountain folk living almost exclusively on goat meat  milk and cheese  are practically giants.
@3dmaster   the many benefits of being lacto persistent.
I agree also  cammy is bae. woooo
chun lI is older   and a master of kung-fu.  the style fits that evolution for the character. she s still gorgeous.
if only life was like a video game where the info panel on items such as fruits and vegetables displayed what vitamins and minerals you would get or lose from them. instead I have to eat this carrot and blindly believe its good for my eyesight.
so in mortal kombat all the female characters were given the same clothes and body type but the only differences were the color of their clothes and their names.
not gonna lie  ryu and ken look freaking awesome as  what I can assume are  aging pretty well - like  I have to wonder if sf6 is set after the events of street fighter 3. I remember seeing the trailer not even a week ago  and thinking that chun-lI design looks very good by any standard    not the first time she was wearing leggings - just look at her design in street fighter alpha. and that cammy design looks like an easter egg to the street fighter 2 v anime series - and she looks hot - you ll get no disagreement from me on that one. clearly capcom did something right with cammy at least - if she makes you wanna go to the gym right now  d
I would say  no because the leak show camI in her classic outfit I can assume the something for chin li
also  have you found out yet what they did to ken he was a happily married  white blond guy and a good father to at least one child  I didn t like sf5  so I dont know if they gave him another one  he s now a divorced hobo  because eliza left him  because she was fed up with him   took his child and his money. still think its not capitulating to the wokies
I dont see an issue with new costumes and I wouldn t be opposed to having unlockable classic costumes.
cammy looks amazing now.  I find crop tops sexier than bodysuits any day.
I think they possibly covered the men as an excuse too cover the women more with less backlash.
imagine changing cammy s iconic swimsuit  miss me with that nun shit
I like the new outfits  personally. it looks like they ve aged up the classic characters to make way for the younger ones  as we saw with snk s garou  mark of the wolves   a game that had only one veteran fighter and completely changed up the rest of the roster.
this is supposed to be years after sf2. I actually like them changing up character s look! chi-lI looks great!
anyone complaining about the wokeness didn t watch the trailer where there s at least three or four  look at dat ass  moments with chun-li.
I like the fresh coat of paint. itsuggests that the characters have faced some challenges since we last saw them. what happened to ken  did somebody kill his dog  did somebody kidnap his family  we dont know but it looks like he s sworn to carry out some kind of pledge of vengeance for whatever reason. and also  jurI is smokin hot. I dig it. looking forward to playing it.
default sf6 jurI went back to 4 though
the designs are perfectly fine. chun lI is teaching others now so she could be a sifu. her outfit is nice. akuma looks badass.
yeah  I like this.  these characters have a unified style that looks like they re all designed to be in the same game  and it was all designed to be plausible and cool.  mk s redesign  the male characters were designed by thirsty gay men  and the women were all played by the same too-skinny sex-neg mid-40s cosplayer.
as soon as I saw chun lI I got concerned  just hope they dont go the way of the new mortal kombat with the females.
I see them aging up but for me the game was ruined by paywalls for half the roster
I hate woke shit as much as the next person but in this case im sure they will have the classic outfits . the new outfits is just to signal this is a new style
so they then put lots of new younger female characters in who can and will be wearing the more revealing outfits... right  oh  wait  no they didn t.
@3dmaster  thats not my point.  but aside from cammy s original showing her butt  and poison   they really didn t have many revealing outfits anyway. unless you include dlc costumes.  chun herself   rose  sakura   karen  ibukI  ect..  its never been about revealing clothes. just about styles that fit the character.
@spiderclaw74  hope elena join soon
@andrea corrales  that would certainly make mr skin here happy. he needs more skin to be happy.
nah she looks like someone from the pre-cultural revolution
there s def a woke element. I cant quite put my finger on it. but there are several males with no shirts....and very few to no females even showing cleavage. half the new outfits are....boring....and the new characters feel uninspired.
they have not released any official bio and one wasn t was one leaked. stop the b.s.
a char being down on their luck is  woke  now  God  y all culture war fiends are completely lobotomized.btw  ken is 3 4ths japanese and his hair is dyed. was always the case.
that leak is probably maybe up if something bad happened his wife maybe passed away since he s wearing some kind of pendant
@j never  its okay to be wrong
you guys are crying so much for nothing  please stop...
@maximum karnage  woke hurdur
they are effing game characters  they dont need to be aged up to add new ones.
@tempered glass  true but it adds to the story vs being a south park simpsons
@fernanda carvalho   thats just it.  they dont look aged up at and many of the designs are in line with woke mind sets.   plus what they did to ken is no different than what they did to luke skywalker.  making him a divorsed hobo.street fighter 3 aged the characters but stayed true what made the iconic.and yes  they shrunk the bust lines of many of the women and gave some masculine jawlines.  another mark of the woke.its not north american style woke.  but to us japanese this is very woke.  and we dont like it.
it is woke censorship  it is no different from jill s skirt being changed into a skort in re3 remake  it is also no different from lady and trish being uglified in dmc5. heh  expect ashley wearing tights instead of a pleated skirt in the upcoming re4 remake.
I think this is by far the best design sf ever had. everyone looks just beautiful. capcom nailed it. Im sure they ll have plenty of skimpy dlc outlifts.
wait a second  mk giving all the female characters  except shiva  the same body type is woke  Im still not sure on what exactly people mean by  woke  but thatstands out as not making much sense at all.as for the sf redesigns  when most of the characters wore very basic outfits  its hard to straight up change what they re wearing and still have their notable style aspects  so naturally most of the changes have instead been more like additions  which does have the affect of covering most of them up a tiny bit more. like what could have been done with zangief while showing just as much skin  change his booty short colour  same for chun lI  they had to keep that chinese dress shape with the high cut thighs  but changing the colours paterns on the dress wouldn t have been much of a change at all  so they also changed the colour of the leggings. personally I think the colour looked better neutral skintoned  but eh. personal preference.
wait that is supposed to be cammy  yea she did get the woke treatment. I could not tell that was her lol.
you guys do know that these are just default costumes and there will be alternative costumes to include nostalgia ones.....right.....right   every sf has this and will always have it. chun was way over due a costume change. the same with cammy. I dont mind chun s  hell by now she s in her 40 s. I think it fits her. cammy s I am not a fan of...but thank God for alt costumes. you guys will be ok. please go touch grass.
the new outfits are ok.
everyone in the woke movement  especially crystal dynamics  should take notes from capcom on how to do diversity. if there s any business that got it right  its capcom.
I think the street fighter 6 character designs are fine so far  both the men and the women are showing some skin  specially characters like jurI who are known to be flamboyant and a little crazy  and characters like chun-lI still maintain some of their key visual features like her muscular thicc thighs  and as always there will be alternate outfits for all characters which can be more revealing or call-backs to previous sf games outfits.my only real worry is that I hope they wont nickle   dime us for every single alternate outfit and that the game would have some by default  Imean its bad enough we have to buy characters to get the full roaster of fighters .
enjoy your weekend!!
people will always find something to complain about. wokeness never crossed my mind during the premier. did they not see chun lI s ass shots as far as cammy  I was watching max dood and he was reviewing official promo material released by capcom in 4k and he pointed out cammy fighting guile in the background. she was in her classic camo paint body suit look. if people are riled up  they seriously need to chill. street fighter women did not get the mortal kombat treatment.
gfuel soundslike a drink dat representsme far as sf6 most of them lookcrisp
honestly Im more upset that this game is making such a fuss about metro city yet there no final fight characters   where guy  cody  haggar  common anyone
usually if its aesthetically woke  we tend to expect characters to look ugly. I dont see that here. the women look more covered than before but they re still sexy and true to their design.
cammy was leaked with her original costume  definitely not woke.
ever since they went to 3d  I dont like what they ve done with the character models in general. the hands and feet are way too big  the male characters  especially ryu and ken are way too muscled. I d prefer them to look strong and toned  but maybe just a bit leaner to show them as nimble martial artists. and personally I think chun-lI s thighs are way too thick. it looks like they put one woman s upper body on another woman s lower body. I think the character street fighter alpha 3 were the best of the series.
yep...hard pass on sf6.
yeah this game is a skip unless we get their original best outfits. for now  I will just wait for jojo all star
yeah overall Im fine with the changes it does seem like an aesthetic thing. it looks promising but I ll hold off as I dont see my guy cody yet
love the fit!
these designs are amazing. all females dont need to be half naked to be cool. especially since this is street fighter  not dead or alive games. people need to stop complaining over new outfit designs. its totally fine.
I love this hairstyle on you!!
you do not recognize her blonde hair  her think silhouette  her long braids  also  I appreciate her new clothes  finally a realistic outfit for a fighter ex-soldier.
@daniel rain  its just my opinion as an outsider. dont get so bent out of shape about it bro.
capcom s yoshinorI ono explained that hands  feet and fireballs in the series have always been larger than they need to be  because they serve as visual markers on the screen to make it easier for players to follow attacks.
@oftenbanned  alright. fair enough. I guess. the muscle thing still stands though.
cody will look the same as he did in sfv. no reason to cry about it.
once upon a time the only concern for a game developer was fun. this is a product of modern times and trying to appease everyone  no matter how unreasonable  unfortunately try to appeal to everyone and you end up appealing to nobody.
words like  modern  really make me pucker when I hear them. the wokies have a very predictable vocabulary  so if you dont know the source  it can be tough to interpret. and in this culture it is impossible not to be hypersensitive. I hate the fact that even the slightest whiff of wokeness can make me sour on an entire release. I did notice that all the female characters are basically flat chested  although they do seem to have the thicc thighs and badonkadonks. maybe thats what they mean by modern...I cant wait for the kardashian body trend to end.as for the characters  I have thoughts  ryu and ken look oddly squished but other than that  the original roster looks pretty sweet. I have trouble picking a favorite from the middle row  they all look amazing. deeday or akuma are my favorites. or juri. I cant decide they look great. the bottom row however looks super sus. luke seems lame - oh look  another military guy from the usa. marisa is obviously on some sort of phd. jamie might be interesting. the french girl is named mimi...how original. almost as unoriginal as naming the mexican girl riri. russian guy with a cane and cape  now we are just getting silly. kimberly is obviously the green m m if she were a human. is this taking place in 1986  why does she have a walkman  of course lady deathstrike  oops Imean a.k.i.  is the coolest looking  but clearly ripped off from marvel comics and nationality-swapped to chinese. if they really wanted to take a risk they would have made her from taiwan.
we ve already seen that classic cammy is in-game from a leaked video. plenty of cheek on display.
if the dlc costumes cover up as much or more then I would probably say its intentional.thing is  I really dont care. my love for street fighter remains in the 2d era. sf4 was a solid entry but the 2.5d doesnt have the same level of charm. alpha and third strike is still where its at.
these are charakter design and concept art decissions. most of the time you will find a ton of unused or cut outfits. its a normal process in the design. anyway im not happy with all choises but I think street fighter knows the charakters well. first thinge I notice here is 7 open buffet outfits on male side 2 on the female side. so yep itseems perfectly fine if males are sexualiced now as in other games. does it hurt no. I trink its a fighting game every character should be atractive and buffed female and male.
looks pretty good  actually. doesnt smell like woke to me.
idk why but if you werent alive for sf2 or even alpha in the arcades its hard to take those opinions seriously. strange but feels its lack of living experience with a certain product.
respect  do not know why I clicked it but I did... good video  nice Christian talk
the female outfits are definitely more tame. I keep thinking back to how they censored chun-lI  cammy  r.mika s super arts a week after the beta. now they re just preemptively censoring their female characters from the get-go.
cammy s been given a thigh gap.
I hope people are not crying  woke  because chun-lI actually looks asian now. lolbut I swear  if they ever reduce her thunder thighs  capcom and I are going to have problems.
there s no wokeness in here. there was no political correct elements in the trailers. I think the game looks pretty decent and the character designs reflect how far they ve come. how they evolved over the years.
I hope not
whether you believe in the leak regarding capcom internally discussing political correctness in their games or not  the female costumes have definitely become gradually more conservative starting around season 3 of sf5. and now  I see it in sf6  both new and returning characters. Imean  after years of wearing leotards in sf  cammy now wears pants by default.  pI will say this  I do like the outfits overall as it fits the aesthetics of the game  and at least for now capcom hasn t reached nrs  level of covering up their females and  average  anatomical proportions  especially mk11. at least capcom doesnt think bare midriffs on girls are evil.  p most outfits I think are improvements  such as jurI rocking what I think is a new version of her sf4 outfit. chun lI looks more mature not just because of her outfit  but also in some of her animations like her parry. overall  I hope this is as far as it will go. this  to me  is fine.
the thing here is...every single game  models characthers change  butt               every single game  they will sell you more revealing skins  even sell you the previous game outfits  and ppl will purchase it without bating an eye
melonie a lot of Christians attend seeker churches. where there are feed milk all the time. very rare is the church thatserves the milk and the meat of the word of God. a good preacher in my opinion. should preach sermons that reach the unsaved  the new believer  and the believer who is more mature in their faith. I like what david wilkerson founder of teen challege  said. I am paraphrasing  if a   preacher teaches the true word of God  most people in the church would get up and walk out  with there checkbooks. david is now with God. pat boone stared in movie depicting david  very good  cross and the switc blade.
this is one time I dont think they went woke  I think they re just leaning heavily into the street art style.  I think they ll still have classic and over the top costumes as unlocks and dlc
ken looks like 3nd strike street figther
cammie and ken have great looks. ken looks like he just got a divorce from eliza.
I dont think they gone woke. I agree I feel like its a default stylistic appearance for the game. Im pretty sure there will be additional outfits including the classic looks. people bitch too much. the game hasn t even been released yet.
holy schizopost.
why does this matter to you  its a video game. seek help.
I was born in 1986 and have played sf ever since I was a child. thanks for the compliment tho lol
@melonie mac go boom  its a generality didnt mean anyone in particular  but exactly if youve played all your life you know who hasnt.
@melonie mac go boom  sis you and sf have same age
censor    when the game currently has buttshots for jurI  mika  poison and cammy
its called new design dude. thats not censoring dude.
@xzmango5  cope
according to her design now  she still has her thighs of power! just smaller than stv design!
you just need eyes to see and a brain to process the wokeness present
@q na  where do you see it present  cammy s design  chun lI s  the new female ninja character  where do you see wokeness
@jcg s lounge  the bottom row of chars   there is a man who has transitioned into womens sports from italy   there is lil blm activist from america  there is a new char from france  which I cant tell what it is  all the so called new chars are all women   where is the young teenage boy represented    its not cause its woke garbage  and this game is already d.o.a.
@q na  bro we dont know if that red head girl is trans. we dont. the character hasn t been officially revealed by capcom. we dont know who they really are yet. the blm activist from america  bro Im no supporter of blm  but what does blm have to do with this  what s the problem with a young black girl ninja  and yeah  most of them are female. so what  so fucking what  why is that a problem  youre looking for something that isn t there. Im with melonie on this. how bout we wait to see what capcom has to say about the newcomers and see for ourselves if its woke.
@jcg s lounge  yea jc   cause we all know women who have arms like hulk hogan and are 7 ft tall   maybe its zangief shrek wifedo you hear yourself    youve lost the plot   you become so programmed  you forgot what a normal human life is  smh
@q na  bro believe it or not  there are very strong women with big muscles in this world. and they re not trans. they re few and far between  but they do exist. Im not programmed and I haven t forgotten what a normal life is. how bout we stop calling everything woke and not let this tired ass culture war get to our heads.
@q na  there s no way youre serious
@gwen  the modern day gamer is a pitiful programmed npc
I wouldn t say all the fema l e characters are gradually more covered up just look at jurI .
@fighting media lounge  yeah  jurI is back to her sf4 form. also  not long after Imade that comment  we have cammy s og costume in action leaked.
@q na  a tall muscular woman is possible cause its a video game
@yu lee  yes im waiting for the first pregnant male street fighter to show up   maybe akuma will have a baby with bison
classic outfits are already confirmed to be returning. there s a leak video of cammy wearing her classic costume.
sometimes I think people are just trying to find problems instead of enjoying the game
I do like the overall designs of the old and new female characters  it fits them well if they were living in the modern world like with chun-li.
they totally did
glad you call it like you see it.  cant be taken seriously if we re just loosly calling every change and update  woke .  I agree with your take on these character designs.also  wow.  I stayed until the end - thank you so much for speaking on Jesus  prayer  God  etc.  thank you!
honestly they can add extra skins no problem
I dont know  I still see jurI s toes  hell  I even see some new french girl s toes now  too. I dont see why people would cry  censorship  when there are plenty of toes of all sorts  freely exposed for fighting game fans to  um  enjoy. once they put socks on jurI  then I ll believe people s claims of censorship.but seriously  the only reason they d ever  cover up  characters is so they could sell more revealing dlc outfits later. thats it. now  when those outfits get banned from venues and stuff  then we can start pointing fingers. people will pay good money to play as the version of cammy with her butt hanging out  and other people will call that butt an affront to God for clout. we all know how this works by now.
melonie mac   if you dont like it. . . me  key word being  if  - why would I not like your channel  please never give up doing these videos  d  d
kof xv all the way!
ken masters new design is very reminiscent of terry bogard s  garou  mark of the wolves  design with the bomber jacket. that jacket is just a very cool choice compared to ken s banana hair sporty t-shirt design in street fighter v. this is the best looking 3d version of street fighter to date. street fighter iv being one of the ugliest street fighters I ever seen stylistically. it released back in 2008  but thats not an excuse for fighting games where all the visual resources go into the character models  considering 3d fighters like soul calibur iv released around the same time and looked gorgeous. characters may have their  sponsored  designs like they did in street fighter v and I wonder if thats still going to be a thing.
ok Im not gonna say chunlI is ugly now. but that is not chunli.
the classic costumes have already been leaked  they just wanted the defaults to fit a more mature and experienced version of the og fighters.
I dont think its woke at all to be honest I actually really like the designs. to me ryu and chun lI looked much more aged like they were evolved. I like that the street fighter girls all have different bodies and I think that if this was woke they would have changed all the female characters into manly women lol
lmfao blanka is wearing essay gang colors.
melonie  do you know a web novel  the salvation war   tl dr satan demands humanity to die  and most of the humans answer with middle finger while preparing for war. depictions of the heaven  hell  and their residents are heavily based on Bible  other religious writings  and associated depictions dating back to middle ages and before  or author s understanding of them . otherwise author is professional military equipment analyst  and weapon porn is heavy part of the novels. may be offensive to some religiously devoted people  and author may have wanted to draw attention by having vaticanto condemn his work  Im not sure if I recall this detail correctly . I enjoyed the novel  and I d love to hear your thoughts about it. tv tropes site has an article about it with links and stuff.
I like the outfits they look cool  but I did notice that they gave the girls breast reductions similar to what mortal kombat 11 did.
also when it comes to demons  weather or not they can read your mind. I believe that God has angels protecting us  even though we may not be able to see them. plus dont forget hebrews 13 2. also doesnt the Bible tell us to not be afraid like 365 times. so  never be afraid to speak out loud to our Lord and savior Jesus Christ. if he is with us then who can be against us romans 8 31
5 months later  and the game is totally cursed. multI colors flags everywhere  gender identity  pronouns  ugly characters from the char creation.  everything is under the sexual identity standards  and capcom agreed to that for the game being sold.
she still got them hips girl
monster hunter is literally the only thing keeping crapcom alive at this point and thats mainly because monster hunter is still a niche franchise where the devs for the monster hunter games have a little more creative freedom. if crapcom dares to screw that franchise up  then they re done for.
I think people are acting like a scalded cat   they are so used to the woke stuff that they expect it from everywhere and this is dangerous   cuz the woke see offense in everything and if we start doing the same are we really that different   when it come to sexy characters   and I said this here before   there is a difference between being sexual and being sexy   a woman can be sexy without having to be naked   look at cat woman   it doesnt get much sexier than that  yet and how much skin do we actually see
thank u. like there are real woke bs out there. but these ppl would go out of the way just falsely claiming anything as woke when it clearly isn t at all.like what they did with mk. when their own arguments literally contradicting themselves. they cry about how they cant get hard for the stripper ninjas cause they look realistic and ready for battle   as they should be since it is about life and death  yet be ok with sonya  cassie  jackie and others. it is just ridiculous which is why ppl would laugh at them
then you stroked the screen and roared out one day she will notice me
thats the first thing that came to mind after seeing chun lI s outfit.it made sense thatshe d wear an outfit that resembles the fact thatshe s older now. ryu s karategImakes sense as well since the guy is a wanderer. dude s been wearing thatsame karategI of his to where its worn out completely. lol
ah  yes  I assume then  that they ve created new  younger  less experienced fighters that are wearing the same time type of revealing outfits they younger versions of the original fighters wore  right oh  wait  they didn t.
@3dmaster  the entire game is going for an urban street punk vibe  and all the leaked characters follow this trend. none of them are  covered  up. also cammy s came toe is even more pronounced in vI than it was in v.
the two latest mh games sold 18 and 9 million. monster hunter is not niche.
bruh....
dude what the hell are you on aboutmonster hunter is literally capcom s best selling franchise  lmao
@bucket  only two monster hunter games out of the whole franchise sold highly much greater than expected   not the entire franchise compared to street fighter and re.but go ahead  keep shilling for crappy aaa game companies who will keep knifing you in the back. modern-day gamers get the garbage woke and corrupt video game industry they deserve  lol.
@heywood jablome  people want more resident evil and we are getting more. stay mad  cope  and seethe.
its definitely not woke. its a fighting game thats adapting to the current lore. the classic costumes are going to be in the game too.
cammy completely lost her unique look in my opinion. her short her is a neckbreaker for me personally. I fkn loved the impossibly long hair. other than that the outfine is... fine I guess. nothing more though.
I loveee all street figher 6   all  p
what a relief.
simple answer  yes  they did go kinda woke. they censored literally every female s outfit.  p.s. doa6 had it worse in terms of censorship on some female characters  and thats considering every department- outfits  bodies  etc. edit  Im hoping the dlc will bring some more  sexy  options. I dont flat out dislike the new styles  just to be clear   but I cant help but to put 2 and 2 together. society went woke  and fighting games have been following suit as of the past few years  maybe ever since mk9 or 10 . they can use the cover story of  oh  we re trying new designs and ideas   but... that dlc better have some  options .
meh... Im no fight game fan  so this barely effects me but I think we should give credit where its due. even if they changed these characters for the purpose of of being woke  they didn t go too far. I agree with you that they did good this time. just like with far left wokies who cry --ism and --phobia at everything  it loses all meaning if youre yelling woke at everything.
Imean it looks hot to me in the trailer lol
they haven t gone woke. cammy has her leotard outfit according to the leaks. and if anybody played sfiv and sfv  we know capcom will add more revealing costumes for the female characters as dlc. I believe the main reason for this is because capcom focuses a lot on esports. that was confirmed by capcom themselves. the morons that complain about this game going woke  might need new pair of glasses or go back and play their own woke ass games.
also chun lI butt is still out did they not watch the trailer
there is leaked footage of cammy doing her super in her classic outfit  and its...definitely interesting. not woke at all. it looks like the new outfit is the default  just to be safe for tournaments.
we all know they re gonna have sexy outfits for the female characters through paid dlc    lolor better yet.. the mod community will do the job.
ok  Im confused  Ive played the old street fighter  but cant recognize the mexican girl with the strange chicken drumsticks in her hand.
I wonder if the resistance to praying out loud is a biproduct of a western enlightenment train of tough. like  thought we re fine praying in our minds  there s this culturally ingrained idea that praying out loud is  irrational  or something. maybe its part of the cultural idea of  religion should be private not public   so praying out loud is internalized as  inappropriate  or something.there s definitely a theme in the Bible of words having power. after all  genesis doesnt say God  thought  the world into existence. he  spoke  it.
the mens designs are like 10 times more sexualized this time. lol
I typically am not interested in channels so dedicated on  wokeness  wingding and the like but I will give you genuine credit for not just mindlessly calling something woke for the sake of pleasing thatsort of audience. you clearly have your own opinion on the matter and I respect that alot especially in comparison to countless channels who bash on anything as being  woke  simply for the sake of grifting that kind of audience.
I still like the original designs however these new designs aren t that bad. the only thing that matters is that if the game is good.
thier still going to have the costumes its going to get flooded with costumes like sf5 eventually
I just wanna give a shout out to capcom for making women look like women despite all this woke culture going around  especially with lady dimitrescu she literally brought sexy back to the video game industry
is that gokus tank top   lol
being vegan is optimal for health and overall the most moral eating pattern.
leak shows her old style will still be in
@thafranchise  yeah  just saw it. thanks though!
you cant call everything you dont like woke.
@diversity fields  dude  two of the two female characters with bare legs were fully clothed. its simple math.
@krivov tim  and how is this woke
@krivov tim  jurI always wore pants and cammy s classic outfit is still in the game...
only time will tell.
if modders have to fix the game  its not worth paying for it.
@3dmaster   fix
then you dont get it
the males certainly show far more skin than the female characters thus far. Im assuming there will be classic costumes for dlc though.
@wakaI ryu  does thatsound right to you  people should be waiting out by the doors for the developers after shift.. fuck that
@warrior s hedge  umm how does this have anything to do with my comment. I stated a fact  males in the images are wearing less clothes than females. I dont know if its woke  but it is suspect. I saw a leaked video where cammy was wearing her classic leotard. proving we probably shouldnt judge an entire game on one trailer and a leaked image.
people need to understand thatstreet fighter 6 is going back to elements of what makes street fighter  street fighter   the hip-hop culture and street fighting. there is nothing woke about this. people be using woke like the plague and honestly its lost all meaning. like anything thats remotely a change and current to the era is seen as  woke . capcom is listening to the fans problems that have been mentioned from street fighter 5 and learning from there mistakes  going back to the old days of street fighter 3rd strike with hip-culture culture. the character designs are both beautiful and accurate to not only their personalities and culture but their progressions and growth as characters over the years. remember street fighter 6 will take place a few years in the future  not everyone is gonna dress and stay the same. Im sure there will be dlc and costume later down the line  but calling their new outfits or even sf 6  woke  is just because that aren t too revealing is just a childish perceptive.
I dont think so...japan loves to change things up once in a while. I think some of the characters looks great  kof and street fighters always have women having different looks and even their tomboys are still feminine.
alot of people in the comments are mocking you without watching the video.
I turned on the bell cuz of the  Christian talk  youre sowing seed  praying for you melonie. God bless.
uh boy this video did t age well    we have a gay host in the game  steroid woman  just  4  girls manon is a model but has the face of a man  2 little girls and 10 dudes. they made kimberly with the help of a black consultant   they took away the boobs size from 5 and made them small. I think this video needs an update
I hate cammy s new look  she s has been striped from everything recognizable  looks uninspired compared to everyone else and completely foreign to her classic design. chun and jurI get to keep their motif design and still looking brand new in 6  while cammy just looks generic or a watered down rip off of android 18. I cant believe her braids are gone  the most iconic part of her design  what made her silhouette  gone and replaced by a jacket strap...nostalgia outfit wont be an excuse for this awful design decision. might as well be a new character.also  I dont like how chun lI s face is completely different now  there s a new character in 6 that looks more like chun s face than chun li. I dont get the point of capcom changing all the female faces for their games lately  leon in re4 remake still looks like leon  yet ash looks like a different person now. same thing with lady and trish in dmc5  or claire in remake 2.
female abs are very underappreciated  lets be honest.
dude...I just realized.chun lI would be 54 by now.boiiiiI she ages like a fine wine  dont she  Im jealous.
well street fighter characters has never dress up like strippers lol. chun lI s original costume had always been conservative. at the top of my head the only female characters with a sexy look was jurI and cviper.
not like stripper  you see the male characters there right  pretty  much magic mike costumes there lol
glad cammy finally escaped the 80 s. though some of the style changes and body adjustments are questionable across soem of the characters. jurI s breasts have been dialed back  likely to suit her new garb. chun lI is a good change  I like it  cammI is go. just a lot of good changes. just some things need to be adjusted to accomidate a characters original designs in terms of body shape. totally agree on ken. if I have any problem with sf6  it is my experience with sf5. absolutely ruined that game.
how melonie can say  the graphics have more style  is beyond me. shes right about the outfits but the new graphical style is just so bland. street fighter was one of the few fighters that kept that oldschool anime style when going 3d. the modern games managed to pop and stand out among other games that all have those ugly uncanny valley 3d graphics thats somehow popular in the west.   now all they need is to say the words  open world  and in-depth crafting system  to complete the transition to full on mid status. so many franchises ruined by going after mainstream casual western markets. ive seen this happen way too often. expect less complexity or fun and more  accessibility  here. game journalists will eat this up and unfortunately it will most likely be both the most disappointing  and highest selling street fighter game ever.
camI sold out to lululemon.
despite the changes of the female characters in mk 11. mk11 is still a fun game. oh Im not gonna lie I do miss jade s victory pole dance in mk11.
if it was woke  chun lI wouldn t be thicc anymore
you can avoid being like a pharisee by remembering Jesus said  as I have loved you  so you must love one another. by this everyone will know that you are my disciples  if you love one another.  Jesus said that his followers will be known by their love  compassion and generosity. nobody will be perfect  but they will not live a life of cruelty or selfishness.I believe the fire and brimstone preachers actually sent many on a path to hell by making Christianity primarily about avoiding hell - a purely selfish and egocentric reason to claim the name of Christ.
stylish clothes doesnt mean its not woke. and these are mostly just grotesque caricatures of the original sf characters now. - just take a look at that italian  woman   if I was italian I d be offended by that monstrosity   what s with making ryu look more like the hulk  sans green  with every passing game. capcom needs to seriously fire their tumblr style character artists   hire some people that actually know how to draw.
ryu looks like a mexican and ken looks like axel from sor4.
two female characters  who in the past game had bare thighs  were put on pants  and this happens precisely in the era of woke. I am convinced that this cannot be a coincidence.
nope. sf6 looks fantastic.
smart
terrible.
I can see why you d think that. I instantly found her recognizable personally  and my lifelong cammy main brother is obsessed with her new look. but I get not everyone is gonna feel that way
@melonie mac go boom  I didn t recognize cammy at all until the third time looking over the roster and I went   wait  where is cammy   only when I went to specifically look for her did I realize   wait  british nationality  is thatsupposed to be cammy  holy shit thats bad!
are you sureshe look perfect now she look like chinese woman
@andrea corrales  its about the outfight..
disagree
@don jon smith  its fine if you dont like anime art styles and I hope the game is good either way but im not wrong. name 3 or more relavant  3d traditional fighters like street fighter that have anime graphics excluding bamco anime license reskins or smash brothers. if you include bamco fighters you might as well include indie games  fan games and shovelware too and smash style fighters aren t traditional fighters and are kind of its own thing thats slowly becoming its own genre like pokemon. literally everything else either aped psuedo realistic design choices from games like doa  aped western  realism   is a western fighter like mortal kombat  is a classic arcade style 2d fighter like blaze blue or licensed professional wrestling mma games. bamco really only has one fighting game and countless 60 reskins with slight gameplay tweaks and everything else tries for realism.
@coomamon  I like anime style fighters too but  love this new style for street fighter. I like both basically
@don jon smith  I like the western style too but I wish they didn t do it with this series in particular and less often in general with games as its getting overdone. if this was a spinoff then yes I d agree that its fine but the whole fighter genre has basically been having its individual flair ironed out and funneled into one style for a while now. games as a whole are getting less and less visually distinguishable from eachother over time. it wasnt too long ago that you could see a new character from a game series and a lot of the time instantly tell what game they are from by the art style and things like how their clothing armor is designed. final fantasy had a wierd obsession with belts zippers and chains for instance thats gone in favor of realistic street wear in ff15 and generic medieval clothing armor in the upcoming ff16. that kind of eye candy is slowly dissappearing in favor of uniform realism. its strange. as graphics improve the games are getting uglier and less appealing instead of how you would imagine it. uncanny valley aside  they can look good in the same way real life can look pretty which is nice to see for the first hour but still lack the kind of aesthetic that non live action visual media should have. I used to go  thats way too much jiggle physics and they all look like models. must be doa  or   oh that art style and the choice in clothes means its a final fantasy game or holy crap what happened to her face... oh its bethesda.  those days are slowly dissappearing. more games need to be like persona 5 or minecraft and have their own visual flavor. not everything needs to look like a gritty hyper realistic next gen ubisoft game.
@warlok  true. sort of a cel shaded hybrid style of anime and american comic book style. the series has always had thatsort of visuals which carried over to 3d nicely imo. its what made the series easily recognizable and honestly just looked nice. as someone who loves viewing and making art and especially enjoys comics  manga and games it hurts to see everything get homogenized like it has been slowly over the years. imo you arent a fully fledged artist until you ve mixed multiple art styles and added a personal touch to make it your own art style  something street fighter did pretty decently imo. not the most original but still decent. also  copying others art styles is fine for casual fan art or for work where you need to recreate someone elses style like a manga artists assistant has to do in order to help him finish manga panels.  however that art wont have any of your soul in it and will feel disconnected from you in a way that feels kind of like you didnt draw it. having your own style is where the real art begins getting made. when every piece of art looks like they are made by the same artist then there is a huge issue. its why post modern art is garbage. anybody cantape a banana to a wall and turn it into a paycheck but only salvador dalI can melt a clock and turn it into art.
@warlok  oh you mean how the gameplay looked on those games. well that was mainly due to hardware not being able to display enough detail. street fighter games before had the same kinds of issues. the promtional art for ex had the same art style im talking about or at least a variation of it. the newer games managed to capture it really well up until now and looked exactly how my sat am cartoon rotted adolescent mind imagined things back then. the series finally looked like the anime adaptions or even better in many ways. its sad to see them sink down to the western markets level. I honestly should have seen this coming with how they ve taken a 60 dollar game  baked ads into the gameplay and inserted so many microtransactions into the games that mobile game devs would blush if they saw it. I was hoping they cut thatstuff out but keep the art style. maybe make a new retro acrade style one every so often too for fans who prefer those. unfortanately being mid sells big. cutting back on quality and going crazy with greed will probably be the norm for street fighter for now on. most consumers have bland tastes  are way too easy to please and gravitate towards familiar  cookie cutter things. its like how some people will eat mcdonalds bland under seasoned mystery slime burgers every day and like it but put an exotic  colorful gourmet feast with tasty ingredients from all over the world on the table and they act like you are expecting them to eat dogfood. its mind boggling how adverse some people are to quality and excitement and how easily overstimulated they get with more complex  immersive or artistic games.
quit complaining dude. its about time we get some more unique variety in female designs dude
aren t you mexican
they re literally skin tight pants.. they might as well be naked. you people are so easily triggered over nothing. lol
with regard to salvation and Christian living  the dissonance stems from the nominalization of salvation so present in contemporary evangelical soteriology. they took augustine at his most polemic  distilled it with aquinas  then filtered out the nutrients with luther  reaching toxicity with calvin.  the notion that there is a moment when one is forever  saved  by accepting Jesus as one s Lord and personal savior is just wrong. for anyone living after the resurrection  we have all already been saved  yet none of us have secured salvation. st. paul admonishes us to  work out our salvation in fear and trembling.  Jesus teaches us with the parable of seeds falling on different types of ground. evangelical soteriology simply does away with the seeds that fall flourish far a time before withering away. all of this began with the scholastics  reification of grace. but grace is not a thing gifted to us by God  rather  it is the indwelling of the holy spirit - it is a relationship. God saves us through his paschal work but we must co-operate with God by accepting this salvation by conforming our will to his and by allowing our souls to to be in communion with the trinity. we are like drowning men to whom God extends a hand from the boat  but we must take his hand and hold on. while the catholics are mistaken in considering grace to be a created thing that God gives us  the protestants compounded the error  best exemplified by luther s description of a saved soul as a snow-covered dung-heap. according to luther  God doesnt even give us grace  he just plays mind-games with himself accepting a corrupt soul because is has been camouflaged by that which he himself threw over it. at least the catholics hold that grace is transformative - salvation isn t simply a matter of categorization  but rather the process by which we allow God to restore his image and likeness in us. God fixes the crack  he doesnt just paint over it. we truly  partake in the divine nature   not just watch God s slight-of-hand magic trick. the reason why a person who is  saved  still sins is because salvation is a life-long process  not a single point in one s life when a man chooses to conform his belief to a particular theological position.I do agree with your commenter that we ought to employ oral prayer. having to form and enunciate the words forces one to think about what one is saying rather than just feel something indefinite. we are a union of mind  soul and body  and our relationship with God necessarily involves all three because eternal life ultimately includes the physical resurrection of our actual bodies - glorified though they may be. when God created the universe  he did not merely think it into existence  but rather said  let there be light  etc. in some way  oral prayer is a trinitarian act similar to creation itself. we formulate the words as the father begets the son - the eternal word  but the creation of the prayer must be completed by moving air through our mouth as the spirit proceeds from the father.tangentially  this is why sacramental confession is so important. it is so easy to delude ourselves into thinking that we have repented of our sins when we just feel regret and wish for forgiveness. sacramental confession requires us to actually think about our sins  and humble ourselves by revealing them to the priest  who  as the formulation goes is  merely the witness bearing testimony  of what we confess. the process of being forced to confront our evil and put it into words is what helps us not hold anything back such that we  leave the physician unhealed.  thus  even for your poor souls separated from the one true church   I encourage you to verbalize and speak aloud your confession to God  your soul will thank you.
the fact she would even consider calling this woke just shows you how infected her mind has gotten  these antI wokies  just cant enjoy a game for once with out calling it woke  the oufits look fine and look good. dlc is probably the classic uniforms. . I dont think people should worry so much. just enjoy the game.
why does cammy look like androd 18
I love beautiful female character designs  but  as a Christian guy  I gotta say I do appreciate that most of these characters dont look like strippers anymore. it makes it easier to play the game when you can actually look at the screen because youre not afraid of being tempted  you know
they look good....
cammy has abs  but she s not super buff
every time you say boomers I think of fallout new vegas
@melonie mac go boom     mushroom pizza -- my kryptonite.
they already went woke in sfv  censoring many outfits and camera angles. it can be fixed on pc  but its annoying. and 6 looks even worse.
you are so cool. wish you would unblock me on twitter though...
not low effort enough to be woke.
I dont know about y all but all of these characters look like hobos but now given clothes from a salvation army.
cammy looks like android 18 from dragon ball.
I love all of them to something  new cammy I love  sexy she will get her old suit
seems like right to censor had gotten to her. stripper outfits
covered up     mature.
so far cammy has been seen with her classic out and chun lI now has ass-physics. not woke.
I luv chun li. thiccccc
I agree 100 .  is a style and the characters are supposed to be older like chun-li.  mk is terrible how the females look more like men.
I think the games have been gross looking sense 3d
bro wtf wtf they re just videogame character
@andrea corrales  true  but God doesnt say its alright for me to lust after them because they re fictional. also  I love the characters in street fighter  even if I think the artists for those games usually portray them dressing too immodestly. if cammy was real would she really be dressing as provocatively as she s usually portrayed  I dont think so. poison would  probably  but you could convey thatshe s a character who wants male attention without her showing off as much of her body as her artists usually have her doing.

yeah its great
going woke going broke wont buy another street fighter game.
hey melonie I just want to say that I really like and love street fighter video game series and movie  ok melonie. anyway I do not have a no problem with the design of the characters for street fighter video game series and movie  ok melonie. anyway I hope you and everyone else agrees with me on this topic of this video  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a great day and evening at home with your pets   have a good night too melonie.
japan doesnt care about being woke. mortal kombat is an american game which is why it did what it did design wise.
I just dont like the ingame model design
I do have a criticism of cammy s new look   she looks too much like dragonball s android 18.
who is calling this woke  dont judge a book by its cover. look great to me. oh and street fighter looks good also.
love your top
personally  I dont like the new default costumes. I really  really dont.
14 23 thats what Ive been saying about the alphabet mafia!
hadoken.
sonic boom.
I like how they captured the american black girl at the bottom right.
looks ok I guess.there is guilty gear strive. so I am not concerned. street fighter has lost its soul some time ago.I still love the characters but the games aren t good anymore.
can you talk about how conservatives are trying to cancel pizza hut
sick fucking dbz shirt girl
new outfit is fine I wish people would shut up about it and people using the word woke probably dont know the real meaning
lol street fighter has been woke for a while now.
I like the new design I dont think its woke.
to me chunlI looks a little... off  like its a woman cosplaying her but not rly hitting the face  got thatslide uncanny vally
women need to be more revealing in fighting games  not less! what s capcom thinking !
ok...do you always announce your lies online
cammy started out as an alita knock-off  she still has the same lips  even   so her redesign looking like another manga anime char is fitting.
what about her  never heard of elena from sf3  you need to seek help.
how
explain
she looks like a person
@k e i  yeah im probably just racist here.
people actually think like this  I thought this was a meme title. after reading the comments I see people are being serious lmfao
a Christian  meat eating  antiwoke woman. I dont think life could be better shes wearing a dbz tank top dear Lord
son macku
the designs look bad and woke at the same time.  they do not fit the character and they shrunk chun lI s breasts.  as if there was something wrong with them.
of course its woke.
japan will never go woke
eh its ok. street fighter isnt known for sexy characters.
like  393
woke is bs. yes I want female characters to be ultra feminine
man on Imean manon looks like a man. and the new ridiculously buff spartan female character looks bigger than zangief... than we got the lobby character that is clearly gay with a wisp announcing match ups but anyways... ill be playing tekken8 lol
no sir  I dont like it.
ken looks terrible.
ill say this. this is noooothing compared to mortal kombat 11 . that gae was obvious
I dont think it looks that great. 2022 keeps disappointing
they still have the masculine white guys  so cant be that woke lol
only thing Im sad about is that there s not a single 3rd strike character. what the fuck are they thinking
everything woke turns to garbage.
it looks generic  boring and woke  the new characters  the outfits and the designs are terrible  5 is already 1000 times better than this  it doesnt even look like street fighter  politically correct garbage.
I guess everything is woke nowadays. you people have nothing more important to complain about
they all look terrible. not even for woke reasons but aesthetically they look horrible  I feel like im looking at bad fashion stuff from the 90s and they dont look like outfits you would want to fight in. honda  jurI  dahlsim  blanka I can accept. cammy I like as an alternate outfit. zhangieif I dont like the pants. french lady im fine with  china cyborg lady is fine. chun lI and guile just look terrible. dee jay its the hair that I hate.
I think its because she got old now is no longer young like in sf5 or sf4 or even sf3
not woke at all. you need to seek help.
@maximum karnage  didnt ask  a hole
how is it woke
well have I got news for you lol
@wurstsemmel64  they were pixels
they kind of are known for that. I dont believe you have ever played a sf game.
balrog and deejay dont exist  I guess.
seek help
street fighter is about  world warriors . its always been diverse. cope  seethe  dilate  cry.
reply
@maximum karnage  do you get off to replies
yeah especially since this takes place after sf3

Jesus told us how to be saved in john chapter 3. paul nails it in romans and ephesians.. we aren t saved by works. God s grace isn t maintained by works. your works have nothing to do with God saving you or keeping you. if you think something you did could spur God on to keeping you then youre under delusion. but when you are saved  the holy spirit works. and you change. sin sickens you more  you become more aware of how unholy you are in the light of God.. but its all grace. if it wasn t we couldn t be saved.
I dont really have a problem with the art style or the fashion its the weird him-she character from italy and lil latisha from america   mexico   that thing from france  like f o h capcom this bullsh t is not street fighter
women with more clothes   woke Im sick and tired of this alt-right thought.
street fighter is old and I dont care for it as well as mortal kombat
lots of sjws in the comments below.
cammy outfit looks bad and Imean just bad nothing to do with wokeness
aren t fighting games already woke enough  to suggest that women can fight with men is already very progressive.
the designs are just not recognizable to the characters.
lots of weirdos who have never played street fighter 2 and dont know its literally call  world warriors . always had a diverse cast. seek help
well  according to the leaked footage I saw  her classic look is back  they just gave her a new default costume to play itsafe.
by todays standards its normal but it used to be progressive
fatal fury  kof  and street fighter had women in them from the beginning. seek help.
