those were some fine upstanding chivalrous gentlemen that walked you to your car. heroes really. truly the best
its pretty sad how these few psychotic desperate men make all of us look so weak and simpleton like. he needs to be put in a cage. my daughter is 4 years old. let me catch someone like this man stalking my daughter when she becomes a young woman. no chance.
wow melanie is 36   I would honestly never have guessed that. glad youre safe and very glad you have people who care about you enough to keep you that way!Im sure a lot of us wish we did know this guy  so we could give him a good  talking to.
on behalf of old guys everywhere I apologize for that treatment. with age should come some wisdom and an understanding of how to behave around people  especially around women. I am grateful you were surrounded by friends who care for you.
this is something I warn my daughters about. itseems like everyone wants internet exposure and it comes with dangers. my two youngest are very artistic and post their art. but  there are some freaks out there.I got together with my three daughters this past week and a guy on the phone kept staring at my third oldest. he walks right through the middle of us and stares closely at her as he walks by. my oldest gave this disgusted stare that was a carbon copy of her mom. the girls started plotting how they would take him on if he ever shows up and attacks. stay safe. the internet is full of good and the bad. and sometimes that bad spills over into our offline lives.
its sad that we have so many instances of people falsely claiming this kind of stuff happens that real victims have to fight beyond normal means to have it addressed properly. I pray you stay safe and healthy!
melonie. I am sorry that you have to deal with a delusional guy like that at all but I hope you know that the smile and tone of your voice makes me think that you are strong enough to overcome this situation and rise above it. please dont let this person make you believe the worst in strangers. I have been following you for about two months or so and Im a stranger obviously  lol. I work in a psychiatric facility for behaviorally troubled youth. although I still believe its best to try to see the best in strangers not blindly but safely and wisely so that you dont lose yourself in fear of the unknown. stay safe and stay positive.
be safe lady
those men looking out for your safety were truly the unsung heroes in that moment. stay safe.
thats wild. Im too lazy to go down the street  and visit family. Im not driving 15 hours to see nobody lmao. if any of my friends ever let me be that down bad  I swear bro lol. we re fighting  when I come to my senses lol.
Im glad that youre safe and that you caught this in time. thank God for the gentleman escorting you to your car! also  youre 36 !  I thought you were in your 20 s. the Lord has been gracious to you. keep up the great work youre putting out there!
Im really sorry you had to go through that. hopefully the authorities are able to make sure this guy doesnt try to do anything. thank God youre safe.
take this very seriously   I think you are  and stay safe. the world is filled with damaged lonely creeps who have no grasp on reality and are capable of horrible things.  sorry you seem to have run into one with this guy.
some say thatstalking is a form of flattery.the other 99  of people say its creepy and needs to stop.
glad to see you hydrated   healthy!keep your firearm close by!  if you dont have one  get one   get trained by a professional.every young lady needs to do this. creeps are everywhere.
protect yourself mel  alot of crazy idiots  out there dont have enough marbles in there head and will end up doing something stupid or much worse. bums  creeps  stalkers  pervs  sickos  and other dark twisted broken ppl out there. dont let your guard down  keep  caution up around ppl even if ya think ya know them  ppl strangers may hurt ya. take care.
girl Im so sorry you had to go do that. I have two sisters and had a lot of friends when I was single that had to deal with stalker types and I know its scary. glad youre getting the cops involved  stay safe and know that the communities got your back and will support you
this is insane and so scary. so glad youre safe. praying for you.
I know this is incredibly serious  and I dont mean to diminish trivialize it whatsoever  but I gotta say  I was floored when you said you were 36! this whole time I was convinced you were in your early 20s! in fact  Ive had thoughts like   I wish more of her generation could be based like this   without knowing that youre actually part of mine  lol. Imean that as a compliment  of course. whatever youre doing  keep doing it!on topic  I really hope you get as much help with this as possible. no one should have to deal with this kind of harassment. keep us updated!
just glad to hear your safe more than anything. happy those men were there for you at the time. Im really sorry your dealing with this melonie. no one  especially a woman  should be stalked or feel uncomfortable. you deserve a lot better than this. this guys sick in the head for believing your his wife and saying sexual comments about you. I know Im going on a tangent  its just its really messed up and no one should have to experience that. I hope everything gets better soon. take as much time as you need.
oh yes  they were awesome
@nuancebro should we expecting a video from you soon  and awesome seeing creators I like meeting each other!
@melonie mac go boom get a firearm and get trained.
well done on the chivalry
@melonie mac go boom  you are being stalked by an old dude  butthead laugh
@melonie mac go boom  you need to replace the plates on your car so he cant identify it again. and go get a ccw permit and preferably something in 9mm
@melonie mac go boom  true alfa males indeed sent by God. glad you are ok. prayers for you  God bless.
cheers to the unsung tales of a hero  with the incredible wife  that no one is supposed to know about  for some reason .
@melonie mac go boom  if the dude is crazy enough to stalk you and wait by your car to try and talk to you than you should look at every nook and cranny of your car to see if he didn t put any sort of tracking device to follow you.
despite the new twitter accounts  what the guy did  nothing! melonie says a lot of times in this video  he s old . that is what make him a  stalker  for her. if he was the guy of 50 shades of grey she would love him!!! and take his helicopter!!
your daughter will have no chance once she gets to college. you may even be a grandpap before then.
the worst part in those situations is that there is almost nothing that can be done. the police wont help you until the stalker actually committed some kind of crime. I personally know for a fact that most of the time when women call the police because of a stalker. all they do is show up to look around. and then go on telling her  call us if he comes back  otherwise there is nothing we can do. there is no arrests  no punishment  and even if there was  you have to prov that he was stalking. which is almost impossible. most women are completely left alone in those situations.. its so sad.
@yosef lol damn dude
@kyle william  lolol
your little girls is going to dissapear when she is older
@deplorable pirate captain gunbeard  she lives in a state with constitutional carry  should she feel the need  she can easily get a firearm and training without having to jump through silly hoops like asking the .gov for permission.
@melonie mac go boom really sorry that you had to deal with all of this.  glad that youre safe now.
@melonie mac go boom  Im just saying  I d drive waaaay further than 15 hrs to stalk you..  glad you were safe  hopefully that guy gets the help he needs
well  not heroes lol but that was noble of them and fortunate.
simp much muhammed
@fandom sandy  he was refusing to leave her alone even after she had made it very clear thatshe had no interest in him.  and he was following her from place to place.  thats pretty much the definition of stalking.
@fandom sandy  what in tarnation
@melonie mac go boom  dun feel bad  I would only stalk you with your permission
glad you are back keep the show running and maybe you should watch modest pelican also a yt oh and congratulations to the 100k melonie
you should sell this as a movie plot  @melonie mac go boom
omg she liked your comment. Im pretty sure that means she likes you
ahhhh I get it thanks for being a nice person
@wesley beals  dam u right  melony here I come!!!!
@deplorable pirate captain gunbeard  at least 9mm
@sheepdog  im quite sure she already has one one
yes they are and we need more of them.
more men need to be taught to be like that man to make up for the dangerous types of men
@fandom sandy  dude  tracking someone down thats that far away to ask them out is creepy regardless of looks or age
@fandom sandy  if he has good or bad intentions that doesnt matter the dude was being weird and sent sexual stuff to herhe could of just talked to her and confessed his feelings and took it like a man   got it over with instead of being a stalker.
@lucifer joestar  women are stalkers too men dont need to make up for anythingpeople are individuals the guy is just a weird person male or not.
@lucifer joestar  yes it is.
@elongated man forever  kind of true but women aren t as physically strong or as intimidating as men are
get armed  get hand to hand training  the stuff that works not the fake crap  change your tags on your car  check for tracking devices under your car and between the tires and the wheel gaps  thats a favorite area to stash a tracking device.  stay safe melanie I will lift you up in prayer for protection.
@lucifer joestar  that I can agree with and we should take both seriously  I feel like people take issues with women more seriously and completely ignore it when it happens to a man.
@fandom sandy  waiting for someone in a parking lot and leaving notes on someones car to a person that you dont know at all is not normal at all.
@sheepdog  she does have a firearm
hopefully she has a strong man at home looking out for her  too.
@melonie mac go boom  yellowflash sent me here for no reason  can you tell him that modern dragon ball sucks please
should see my ex wife lol
@fandom sandy  he drove halfway across the country just to  say hI  and thought it was a good idea to upload a 40minute video about how  we re meant to be together  after she turned him down. thats the textbook example of a stalker. youre being reductive and gaslighting everyone because you have misplaced sympathies.
melonie simpsunite!
@martin wallis  good luck with that
@quintessential nobody  ya  her dad is staying with her until they get their new house
@hose a contra razz  I pray that they are safe. but but thats not what Imeant.
@fandom sandy  you want the dude  you go find him and offer your services to him yourself.mel isn t interested  he should leave her alone.driving halfway across the country and obsessively making new accounts to harass her with isn t normal.
@melonie mac go boom  have someone go over your vehicle for a gps tracker box.would be somewhere on the underside  held on with a magnet.
@luciferjoestar  lol just because they aren t strong or  intimidating  doesnt make women any less dangerous. look up the yuka takaoka case for example.
@vergil20xx  they re all in denial. they re never going to smash her or anyone looking like her  and honestly she doesnt look very good
I also feel it necessarily to apologize to the blonde haired girl it was not my intention to allude an attraction ..only a familiarity I say this because some of my other interactions with the panelists that day seem to allude that they might be familiar with my content  ie my bear gryllis spoof ..I was aware that the blonde haired girl was with another panelist
@melonie mac go boom  in all fairness you are smart and pretty so you cant blame him really. at least he has standard.
@melonie mac go boom  is this for some independent film or real
@melonie mac go boom  why you newer told us that u were engaged
and they say chivalry is dead.
@melonie mac go boom  be safe melonie. do you think we should start a petition to for embracer group to take away tomb raider ip from crystal dynamics to a different studio s that has a history of delivering fan justice characters in gaming  we should do that  please. we can all make all difference doing this. I want a studio to do this character justice as much you.
wow im sorry you had to go through thatstay safe
im the guy in the vid. she paid me.
@lucifer joestar  having a taser or pepper spray can fix that issue to equal the playing field.
@thekingfd  chivalry can be another good topic of debate to go along with gender equality.
@will n  I d prefer a gun as its more reliable but those can work too most of the time at least
huzzah! lol
always make these issues public never wait till it becomes to late.
@mvdcc  doesnt apple have a tracking device like a type of disc thing which is crazy because people like this guy will use it for the wrong reason.
@fandom sandy  thats ridiculous why would you say these things a stalker is a stalker no matter the age and it will be so scary for this lady so stop with your blaming the victim card your disgusting.
@fandom sandy you right nothing   harmful    .. but acting in a very stange and deranged way .. blocked and still went to meet her... and the f video  that is f   ed up
excuse me  pickme lady. I think you will find that actually women just lie about stalking behavior in order to slander men and you were probably acting like a tease or something and deserved it  even though it didnt happen anyway.
@cycstorm  wtf is this bs ....
@cycstorm  is a future stalker
thatshit is crazy what is wrong with people
he seems nice.
I know right  she said her age in another video and it floored me  this girl has some good genetics I guess because she looks like she s in her early 20 s.also this stalker guy in insane  someone needs to get the net
@robert n  doesnt matter  her eggs are dead anyway.
@finrod felagund  also  even if it was true  why does this matter exactly
@finrod felagund  what the hell are you talking about
@fafnirs bane  sorry  didn t mean to interfere with your simping. carry on.
@finrod felagund  that explained nothing regarding your statement   and didn t answer the question.
@fafnirs bane  ok
I dont get old people they grew up with chicks from 80 s  90 s  but they settle for some zoomer chick
@osu  not all of us. Im perfectly happy with my wife of 34 years. I enjoy watching melonie s videos because unlike most of the other online critics she isn t approaching her subject matter with anger and hatred  she seems genuinely amused at the insanity of the woke culture but keeps herself upbeat. others in her field  notably guys like nerdrotic  are just so filled with anger that they are depressing to watch. I cant speak to other  old people . however I will say this  if youre not careful someday you will wake up and realize you have become an  old people  and wonder why the rules have changed for you without yourealizing it.
@finrod felagund  oh my God   lotrfanboy5  hahahaha that explains a lot! talk about beta energy.
@robert n  youre literally simping over a woman who talks pop culture for a living and who collects action figures and you think laughing at a nerdy name I came up with when I was 14 is some kind of win for you  lol  the cope is strong with you.
@uc9ieh54q6dihraloymdwbva not actually a boomer  I know that crushes youre sad little heart
@finrod felagund  Im also not a subscriber to the dailywire either. but keep trying its great
@robert n  I dont get it.why would I want her to be in her 60s or  70s
I thought she was in her 20s..
wtf    I thought she d be like 20-25 years old. o_o
@wimpher  I know  right
exercise and good genes  then again jeremy from g g looks younger as well and he is in his 40s
no shot she is 36.
but he loves  her
your girls are smart to plot how they would take him out.
@the_rockness  this is why women should never walk alone. in a group or with some guys they are less of a target.
@lexcore corp  love triumphs all
@lexcore corp  I dont think thats funny
but he s in love with her
democrats should have made you come to the other conclusion a while ago.
@crazychase98  a political comparison is inappropriate .. even if youre not wrong..this might seem harmless for now ..but it might turn in a second to the most serious shit imaginable .. guten tag sincerely a kraut
@dario active-man  making a yt video so you can monetize a potentially dangerous situation is appropriate  Im not sure we are playing by the same rules....
youre the best  jeremy. thank you so much!
my initial assumption was  this has to be a jeremy thing.
probably should do a video to spread the info. pepole shouldn t mess around with stalkers.better safe then sorry.
@the angry imp  Im sure he will  jeremy always goes above and beyond for his friends.
saw your video about it  went to mel to hear it from her.I dont think you mind the 1 lost view   maybe check yours later .
youre the one who introduced me to melonie s channel
Im sorry this kind of shit happened to you. it is a great idea that you get the police involved and get a restraining order.  be sfe my friend.
why did you take down your video supporting melanie
@larry sycamore  I dont know but I bet a bunch of his mgtow audience doesnt care about a cute girl feeling a little scared when nothing actually happened. if this dude showed any evidence of intending to harm mel that would be different but he was just a crazy fan who probably just wanted to meet her. as far as the twitter thing what does that really prove  he was a big fan of hers  he was obsessed with her  yes but thatstill doesnt mean that crazy dude was going to hurt her.
@isaac tesla  your comments are being shadow banned  and rightfully so. go somewhere else with your negativity.
@melonie mac go boom  not trying to stoke fear but dont go anywhere alone if you can help it  and be armed.get training in the use of  and be armed.
dont be inciting violence on other content creators
@no egirls  your comment was shadow banned  as well! hope you enjoy that  with you being a empty account and zero content! you can officially hold your  l !
@sean sarto  its not a call for violence  its a deterrence.
@brent keller  no its clearly language that is meant to provoke others to harass and diminish my reputation  wielding labels such as  stalker  have real legal and social ramifications they are not meant as mechanisms for self promotion at the expense of innocence it is a direct smear on my actions which were always recognized as civil and cordial even in her own accounts Ive already spoken to the sheriff about her followers threats there are no threats coming from either myself or my followers accounts..that  will be problematic for her since she has been the cause of a similar scenario before..for it to be deterrence there has to be a clear threat of intent to do harm ..so far the only clear precise evidence of that comes from miss mac s associates
@sean sarto  no  self defense is a deterrence.perhaps you should reflect on why deterrence is on the field here.and then stay away.
@brent keller  also I really appreciate how she goes into great detail recollecting how I wasn t stalking her ..lawyers will also appreciate it.. then I went to a hotel with my friends ..and he wasn t there! then I went to a bar with my friends..and he wasn t there! ..then I got back to my car and thank God I had 2 guys escorting me..because he wasn t there either! ladies this guy is a stalker! ..pretty suspenseful stuff there truthfully there was a greater potential for the guys she was with to rape her then me because I wasn t there ..they were ..real threats outweigh imaginary ones..Im glad she s considering carrying a firearm now in those regards
@sean sarto  uh  you are.you drove halfway across the country  to be with her  as you yourself said in your video.take the hint dude  youre not doing yourself any favors.
love you jeremy!!! merry Christmas!
@brent keller   to be with her  you must be quoting yourself because my words were to  meet her   at a public event that was partially billed as a  meet and greet  I drove a long way to an event  .because I had tickets to attend like a concert .I wanted to attend and if you watch my video again and again and again you are welcome to do so you will hear that I had no expectations of melonie   listen for that  if   or the event   there was no published schedule until the day of
@brent keller  if  by rudyard kiplingif you can keep your head when all about you       are losing theirs and blaming it on you    if you cantrust yourself when all men doubt you     but make allowance for their doubting too    if you can wait and not be tired by waiting     or being lied about  dont deal in lies or being hated  dont give way to hating     and yet dont look too good  nor talk too wise if you can dream and not make dreams your master        if you canthink and not make thoughts your aim    if you can meet with triumph and disaster    and treat those two impostors just the same    if you can bear to hear the truth you ve spoken    twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools or watch the things you gave your life to  broken     and stoop and build  em up with worn-out tools if you can make one heap of all your winnings    and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss and lose  and start again at your beginnings    and never breathe a word about your loss if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew    to serve your turn long after they are gone    and so hold on when there is nothing in you    except the will which says to them   hold on! if you cantalk with crowds and keep your virtue        or walk with kings nor lose the common touch if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you     if all men count with you  but none too much if you can fill the unforgiving minute    with sixty seconds  worth of distance run    yours is the earth and everything thats in it        and which is more you ll be a man  my son!
@sean sarto  your words and deeds  not mine.you keep trying to justify it as all creepers do.keep on your path  just dont try to claim nobody warned you.
@sean sarto  and here goes the poetry.puke.I ll give you a hint.I had a creep stalking me back in 2004.he didn t understand that I was not interested.his obsession drove him to continue trying to contact me constantly.it took unpleasant things happening to him to get him to comprehend that his path was not a good one.trying to save you the trouble.
@brent keller  your falsehoods  dont make threats to protect them at my expense..that is evil
@brent keller hey Im sorry you have had bad experience..so have I but dont let them blur your judgement..your constant implied threats wont ever elevate such judgments
@sean sarto  and thats why I am giving you truly good advice that it would behoove you to follow.your choice.there s always a choice.
@sean sarto  but  they aren t false.you need to listen to my advice and just leave it be.it wont be a road leading to what you think it will.
@brent keller  sounds like you are quoting comic books  kid..
@brent keller  here a read this again until the truth starts hitting you hard  also I really appreciate how she goes into great detail recollecting how I wasn t stalking her ..lawyers will also appreciate it.. then I went to a hotel with my friends ..and he wasn t there! then I went to a bar with my friends..and he wasn t there! ..then I got back to my car and thank God I had 2 guys escorting me..because he wasn t there either! ladies this guy is a stalker! ..pretty suspenseful stuff there truthfully there was a greater potential for the guys she was with to rape her then me because I wasn t there ..they were ..real threats outweigh imaginary ones..Im glad she s considering carrying a firearm now in those regardsend story.
@sean sarto  again  youre the one who said on video youre meant to be together and traveled across country.again  normal people dont do that.and since you mentioned lawyers in another response  a good lawyer would be screaming at you right now to  shut up! shut your mouth and for God s sake stop trying to justify it!
hoho  the mighty quartering is a follower of miss mcgoboom. how about a cross-channel movie review
@sean sarto  yes  your gaslighting is running on funes.
jeremy-!!!!!
jeremy if you decide to put together a security team for her. Im game!! I work cheap lol
great advice bro
@sean sarto  actually curious  are you going to take any type of legal action since you claimed that this was some sort of defamation
@melonie mac go boom  do you own guns  you better buy some if you dont already own guns and I dont know what state you are in  but in some you can carry with no license  in some you need a license to carry! get a license if your state is one that requires that and always be safe in public.
@will n  the guy stalking sarah mclachlan tried to sue her claiming the song possession  which he inspired with his creepy actions  was his in entirety.so  wouldn t surprise me if he tried.
jeremy is a true dude
@brent keller  so what is your connection with mel  who are you to pass out unsolicited advice to people  I imagine the truth would be hilarious but we ll never know.
@a1b1c184  what is yours and who are you  do berate others for saying  this isn t right  when a creep drives fifteen hours to harass someone you seem to have a problem.
@brent keller  sir  you are the one on youtube giving people advice they did not ask for. for a person to think that highly of themselves they must be important like at least a doctor or lawyer or even a pastor would work. if you feel qualified to tell others how they should act without them asking you I think its fair to ask who you are.Im no one but Im also not telling anyone what to do or giving any advice. do you understand  the more you type Im thinking you may not be the sharpest tool in the shed anyway.
@a1b1c184  its really amusing to me that this is sooooo important to you that you have to harass people.and once again  its weird that youre this worked up over people telling a creeper to knock it off do you often defend creepers do you identify as a creeper or just generally fanboy over them
ooohhhh thats got to sting when youtube wont even post your reply because its so lame. lmao!!
rofl this had me rolling
wonderful what makeup does isnt it
how do we know the escort was not also a stalker  if we have learnt anything from scream  it is that there is almost more than one.
@the waifu laifu  deathwolf   its not always makeup. my mom never wears makeup no one ever believes she s in her 60 s.
lmao  I was shocked to hear her age too. I thought she was like 24.
@the waifu laifu  deathwolf   its good genes and clean living. she doesnt wear that much makeup
the authorities are too busy arresting people for self defense and trying to silence opinions they dont like. they wont do shit to stop a stalker.
@nikolas demoulin  sad comment  but facts. real crimes are becoming okay and minding your own business is becoming a crime.
if it ends up on kidnapping and potential non consent interaction. yeah its japanese level creep we re talking here.if he s a troll  he s a tasteless one. even alex stein dont steep to this level.
only the 1  of stalkers say that its a form of flattery!and mayyyybe we should be locking up that 1  ...just in case
meanwhile hideous radical left content makers  where are my stalkers
to put it into perspective  it is courtship and flattery if the girl likes you. it is stalking and harassment if she doesnt. thats the simple long and short of it.
@milliardo5  dear Lord I hope youre joking
some say to follow them on twitter  twitch  facebook  snapchat  join their patreon  buy their merch  subscribe to the channel  become a member  send me fanmail  etc. but.. dont actually physically follow me.you wanted followers  you got followers. it probably started when you thanked him for a donation.
@berserkir claws  no  thats the barest actually. its simply if a person likes you or not. of course there are already hints before that  unfortunately most men are clueless to cues that women show if she likes or doesnt like you. this guy here just doesnt take the hint  but he can be dangerous if he takes this too far.
let s all look on the bright side  at least melonie s future husband isn t a vegan  just a cannibal.
@milliardo5  it can be dangerous if the lover boy takes twitter stalking too far    honestly it looks like she is upset cos one of the men that are usually invisible to her made himself visible  it is not different that the ugly guy at school asking out the popular girl only to get mocked infront of everyone at school  but both his post rejection shame and her victimhood poussing being more public
this is such an important piece of advice. there s a reason firearms are made  and this is one of them.
please provide timestamp for evidence. dont just reeeeetoo a guy.
who the heiI says that  I had a girlfriend who moved very near my house because of insecurity and jealousy  it was unbearable to have her knowing everything that I did  cant imagine what real stalking feels like.
@zen man  nah  thats a difference between being courteous and thinking the woman is your wife because of twitter...I traveled five hours via bus to meet a girl once but she fuoking knew about it  she was waiting for me  we ve talk  got giddy and stupid in love before that  and even then I was worried if she wouldn t steal my organs in the end.even if you do know a person  dont show up unannounced like this creep. its annoying in most cases. this dude didn t travel to say hI  he thought melonie was his wife!
@ redacted   tldr   to the first part  he didn t though thatshe was his wife  he wanted for her to be his wife  thats why he went to see her  to a public event thatshe announced  talk to her and left her a simp cart in the car   the only stalky thing he did was after gotten rejected and blocked he started to hate follow  that doesnt mean that he is dangerous or a kidnapper
those thatsay its the former  are the same nobodys that  throw their credit cards at girls on twitch and lonely fans
@cagney billingsley  stalkers  we have standards.
@milliardo5  delusional dum-dum.
@milliardo5  pretty stupid take.
@zen man  stalker lover cringe.
@zen man  let s take it again into perspective  until this video  the guy most likely didn t know what mac feels. for him it might be admiration  which isn t uncommon for celebrities to have such people. now though that he knows what she feels  then he should flat out quit. the video is more than just a hint--she is telling him she s not for him. its actually good mac spoke out and told him in this video thatshe s not for him in any way. if he continues this and if he takes to going to her home or hanging around near it  then the potential for danger is very real.
ban pron alcohol is a start teach men the proper way to be men by  mentally and physically and control.
yeah! I know its off topic for the serious subject matter  but I had to back the video up and listen to her say that again. I d have thought a young looking 26  tops!  great genes and really good self-care  I guess. anyway  on topic to melonie  stay safe  get help from friends  family  and concerned authorities. also  try to get yourself removed from all those public information aggregate sites. some of them collect a dangerous amount of information that isn t even behind a paywall. I wish you all the best in this!
same. lol. I would ve thought early 20s too. haven t seen many of her videos but the ones I have seen were good. but thinking back  it makes sense considering the gamestop tv deal.
glad to see your in good spirits after thatscary encounter. its crazy to think that people would drive so many miles for just a brief encounter. I hate traveling anywhere that doesnt involve warm weather and a beach.
never go somewhere alone. and dont be afraid to ask for help or company.I hope this gets sorted out.
mel is gonna have a good future husband someday.  its not gonna be a stalker.  and we will all be happy for her.
so happy to see you doing better. welcome back! sorry youre going through some creepy stuff.please do all you canto keep yourself safe. I hate the fact thatsome guys cant just love a woman s content without having delusions.
ever since Christina grimmie was shot and killed by her stalker back in 2016  Ive hoped online personalities and public figures took stalkers and crazy fans seriously. we never know how far they ll go. hope you stay safe melonie.
Ive been stalked before it is scary and so not fun! stay safe mel  and definitely get a tro.  sending prayers your way
I feel sad for both of you. for massively different reasons naturally. be safe  I hope you got the help you wanted to keep him away. he needs a professional. loneliness can break one s mind  I wish him also to get better. hugs!
the most unbelievable thing in this video to me  is to find out that youre 36! lol I was sure you were in your 20 s. so glad to hear you are safe  and that you have friends willing to do the right thing. keep up the good work!!
Im glad your safe. I pray that God continues to watch over you and use your for the glory of his kingdom. its great that you ve been given the opportunities and platform to share God with the masses and it would be truly sad if that was cut short because of a stalker or anyone that would wish to do you or other harm. stay safe and keep on doing what youre doing.
I work with a dude that goes through the same lengths of obsession to meet women they dont know... very scary how far these people will go to get attention from a woman. keep safe melanie.
he s obviously a trucker  so being a former long-haul driver myself  I ll forward this to my brothers and sisters still out there to be on the look-out for this creep
as awkward and potentially dangerous as this whole thing is  itseems like mel s in a much better place these days to be handling itso well. so  good for her.
the big issue that causes situations like this is how difficult it is to have someone involuntarily committed. Ive gone through a lot of this sort of stuff with my brother  who is a bipolar schizophrenic  he s been in and out of hospitals and jails his whole adult life  the moment he isn t being forced to take medication  he stops taking it and goes back to being crazy. the problem is that once someone is an adult  its literally almost impossible to get them treatment if they dont want it and aren t actively being sentenced to it by a judge. I absolutely understand the freedom concerns  freedom is something Im big on  but itshould be a lot easier to intervene when someone is seriously ill and needs help for their own good and the good of everyone around them.
thank goodness youre okay. Im glad you have the means to defend yourself just in case. there was a story a few years ago of a cosplayer who had to hide in the closet with her husband until police arrived because a stalker showed up at her house. stay safe!
be safe melonie! we be praying for you!
I hope you stay safe mel. and I hope this dude gets help for his e-girl problem.
load the shotgun melonie
dang im so sorry that this happened.  can really put into perspective how for granted some of us cantake things like just basic safety.  im glad you are feeling better both from this experience and from getting out of the hospital.  hopefully this will all be resolved soon.
the unfortunate dangers of parasocial relationships. hopefully this all works out well in the end
outside of carrying  best thing you can do is be extra observant. dont have to be paranoid but check your surroundings time to time and pay attention. mostly while out and about but even look out your window at home here and there and look for anything out of the usual. be the predator in cases like this. God bless.
I say give the dude a chance
6 years and this one still stings a bit.
so its happened once in over 6 years and you are telling her to  be careful   sure  if she has some kind of evidence this dude intends on harming her I think she should make videos  call the police  do anything she canto protect herself. just remember she has decided to be a public figure and her content suggests she is a fun  kind of flirty girl so she shouldn t be surprised when she gets a nut job like this. I think this one is harmless though and if she would have got her 2 friends to go with her and just confronted the weirdo I bet he would have left and stayed gone.
jason david frank  green ranger  took his own life last month but he too had a stalker who was going to shoot him some years ago. I think his name was mathew sterling. he was caught by the police though and imprisoned I believe.
anyone crazy enough to become a stalker should always be treated seriously.
@a1b1c184  its not harmless if he drove 15 hours just to see someone he doesnt know personally. you sound just as crazy as the stalker
@smg  funny  I was thinking the same of some of you people with the  ohh my God is she ok        nonsense. some people are just gullible fools and apparently this space as more than others. my opinion is my business and I tried to give an explanation for it as to not sound like an insensitive jerk. I ll say it again  if he threatened some kind of violence towards mm she should make videos  take out charges  do everything possible to get the guy exposed. I have heard nothing of any violence threatened at all. attractive women do not get a pass with me to act like attention whores with no push back. I know you dont agree because you think you might have a chance with her in your crazy mind but no  according to you Im the crazy one. ok wildman  whatever you say but evidence proves otherwise.
@smg  thats your comeback  fyI Im married for 12 years now with a kid. lol. I guess I have to be a bad person of some type to disagree with you huh. why even say this nonsense  its just an opinion if you have a point I was missing or something like that I will gladly admit I was misinformed and this new bit of info changes things but based on what we know I think mm is using this to get attention as opposed to this being a real threat. you can disagree with me wildman  really. you dont have to make me into some kind of evil person just because we disagree. I hope whoever hurt you got what they deserved.
@a1b1c184  youre the one who typed out a whole paragraph over my two sentences. seems like youre the hurt one  my dude.
I still cant get over that.
@a1b1c184  my comment is definitely posted lol I dont know what drugs youre on. okay  bud.  good luck defending your stalker friend as well  he wont love you either
stalkers are selfish and narcissist people who care about themselves. we are not going to cry if something bad happened yo them.
@smg  your gaslighting is revolting.in the bin you go.
@dragon ball fans cant read  I swear y all just throw the word gaslighting out there when you dont even know what it means. you cantake yourself into the bin
youre being awfully quiet now.........
Christina grimmie is the only time a famous person died and I cared
for me  I was thinking of bianca devins.  now I have another case of stalking-turned-tragedy to look into.
yeah exactly
@smg  youre literally trying to label him as an evil human being and that he is friends with said stalker  just because he isn t fawning over melonie the known attention seeker.100  gaslighting to make him question whether he actually is a good person or not.
@dragon ball fans cant read  the man said dude was harmless after driving 15 hours to meet her and made a whole video about how they belong together. can you not read
look up josh1994   he s been stalking nayeon from twice and nobody does anything about it . these laws must change .
it happens in japan a lot too.I remember a idol got stabbed cause a dude saw her address on her computer screen in the reflection of her eye...shit is absolutey wild...its like super super common for a lot of japanese celebs to have stalkers too..I dont get whats wrong with people
@smg  sounds like a false flag for melonie to gain attention.
@dragon ball fans cant read  why is that
@dragon ball fans cant read  what makes you say that
damn man why you gotta bring her up Imiss her. sucks what happened. I ll never forget talking to her in comments before she blew up. hope she s resting well.
@a1b1c184  that is not how stalking works. the person doesnt have to make direct threats of violence to be considered dangerous  and many stalkers will not be discouraged by merely having a couple of friends nearby.  someone who makes  belong together  videos and drives 15 hours is sending out huge red flags  in the real sense  and is not to be trifled with. this is a serious matter and itshould be treated as such. sadly  many people do not know how to deal with a stalker and assume all kinds of myths  i.e.  they re not dangerous if they dont directly threaten violence   until its too late. also  her craving attention or acting like she does has no bearing on whether this guy is a stalker. no one deserves to be stalked.
@glenn page music  yeah  the first thing a person should do in thatsituation is make a youtube video about it. that will totally help make her safer and is not just a cheap attempt to get content out of nothing. I totally feel so sorry for her. all you people are missing the point. she is making this into more than it is for content and some of you are being marks. I dont care if you like it or not its true. Im not sure how you can even prove Im wrong other than spouting a bunch of emotional opinion based jargon that is cheap and just basic word salad. the guy was super weird and creepy. he showed signs of being mentally unstable. he did not show any signs of being violent and notice how its a few days later and we are hearing nothing about it. Im not responding to any more of these emotional simp reply s. either say something new and interesting or just dont waste yours or infinitely more important my time.
@a1b1c184   I have said nothing overly emotional or overwrought. I know first hand about stalking - real stalking  not fantasy  or tv or movie stalking - and how to handle it. my point was it doesnt matter if she is playing it for attention. thats irrelevant  because his behavior is a big deal  one that you are downplaying. her drawing attention to it is a problem mainly in the sense that it makes a potentially dangerous situation even more dangerous. however  calling her nasty names and  pushing back  against her  even if her actions are misguided  smacks of victim blaming. personally  I never said she should be making a youtube video because engagement is the one thing a stalker craves more than anything. I actually feel quite strongly thatshe shouldn t make such a video  unless specifically advised under very exceptional circumstances .but the fact thatshe made this vid has no bearing - as I initially said - on this being a very serious situation. it doesnt matter if the guy didn t threaten direct violence  or she made a yt video  or she has a bunch of simps watching her or whatever  all that is irrelevant.no one deserves to be stalked  regardless of what mistakes they make in how they initially handle it. and no one needs to be called names or  pushed back  against. I agree thatshe shouldn t be making vids about the guy  that doesnt make the guy s behavior  more than it is   because its already a very serious matter.
ya ur shadow stalking u is scary.
yeah  I thought she was in her  early 20s. Im 2 years older than her  but I look 20 years older than her.
its the asian genes I think
thank you so much!
so...cancel him.
@highon life is thatsupposed to be a  gotcha
@taterboob  no. I hoped some of you were willing to be honest. I guess I was overly optimistic. do you think this dude is right in the head   answer honestly. find it in yourself.
@highon life  you do realize canceling someone on twitter wont stop them from sawing your head off in your sleep  this is real life and it requires real solutions.
@highon life  not so much a  cancellation  as having the truckers relay this to multiple state police agencies to require them to investigate and do their job.
@highon life he isn t the victim and warning people about his behavior isn t  canceling  him. you have an uncanny ability to see things backwards.
@rlh125  no the proper term used to be  disappear him
bonehead truckers
@highon life  no... send angry truckers to mob violence him because... he made a video about driving  Im confused...
@telethea the end bringer  and sending angry truckers to beat him up is a solution how  exactly
@jaximus prime  nobody said police... this is mob violence. truckers are not linked to law enforcement.
@diogenes dworkinson found the guy who let bullies beat him up.
this isn t helping until dude is actually charged with a crime.  until that happens   this is mel s mob attacking a presumed-innocent individual with targeted  group harassment.  this is the kind of white knighting that gets creeps off when they should eat a charge.   think he s right in the head  is not a court order or decision  not legal solid ground at all.  he can lawyer up and come after mel for this video until charges are a thing.  thats the system.  right     legal.  in fact its the exact opposite quite often.  dont go for pitchforks just because someone felt creeped out... hey rlh125  he is the victim of us mobbing against him here until actual charges happen.  jaximus... how did you get trucker out of all this exactly   you sure you are turning your great trucker-mob powers on an actual threat   or just a creep   because its perfectly legal to be a creep  constitutionally protected several times over.  Im not arguing he s not what we ve assumed.  I am pointing out the burden of proof.  that matters.  you aren t helping mel here.  mel  stay on the  no one go after him  everywhere public online.  at least until there s charges  if thats going to happen.  courts dont give a fuck how you or I feel.  letter of the law  all that.
@palladiamors  I was thinking the exact same thing
@dave mcduringo  my dude  stalkers are famously known for harming the very people they created in their mind as a  we belong together  scenario. the point is to not let it get far enough where this dude has another chance at stalking her again or worse. making everyone else aware of a stalker is not anything else you think it is.
@roger  aw. salty about something
@jonathan stevey  stalker  timestamps for evidence  please!!! she reeeeetooed a man  posted his face  posted his full name  and thanked angry truckers for offering to get other angry truckers to look for this guy irl.please  show me the evidence that justifies this. show me the proof of guilt she used to incite all of you up into a mob rather than going to the police. let me see it.
@talynstarburst  and you got his face and his full name  so now you can stalk and harass him irl because some egirl reeeetooed him for allegedly stalking her. timestamp for her evidence  nah  who needs it  white knights away!!!
@diogenes dworkinson  and you ran as soon as I said 20th account...you are a disengious victim blamers...
@aqua mew  where d you go  mew  what happened to all your unbeatable arguments
so truckies show themselves to be awful people yet again
looks like the interior of the volvo cabs. so  probably o o.
@blox117  many are  yes. I did otr  I know many and they re almost entirely not right in the head. a few  like me  are relatively  normal   Im not normal  Im just not that abnormal   and trucker culture drives most of the normies out. no pun intended.
@talynstarburst  I dont even go to the store  I get things delivered. amazon uses vans to deliver them. enjoy your high school dropout education though!
@noneya bidness  thank you for being honest
@highon life  stalker lover.
@talynstarburst  they lowered it to 70-hour weeks  we used to drive  legally  88 hours a week.  there were 8 21-hour cycles per 7-day week  11 on  10 off .I got out just when they switched over to electronic logs. so  its been a while. I didn t say  others aren t off . let s be honest about it  it takes a  special  kinda person to live life on the road. anti-social  often narcissist people who desire no supervision  or accountability. many truckers in my family  including my father  and several close cousins. not one of them is  by any stretch of the word   normal. if I were being brutally honest  they re all fubar d in the head. as were all my trucker acquaintances. I knew maybe three drivers who struck me as not f  king nuts. and as I stated  Im not exactly  mr. normie   either.
@blox117  its not like it is a secret. truckers are not the creme de la creme of society.
@talynstarburst  youre not wrong. normal is going away  quickly  and everyone hates their jobs these days  happens when they re working harder than ever  more qualified than their bosses  and earning what they did in the 80s  but cost  of living is  5 times higher. getting no respect from clients and supervisors doesnt help. .but be honest. truckers are nuts. not just  weird   but loco no cabeza. always been that way. this isn t new.
I noticed that too. I was confused though. was it 15 hours  minutes  or miles  driving 15 minutes is a lot less crazy than 15 hours. also  another question  what if I go to the gym on the following tuesday cause I see a cute girl on a tuesday at my gym  I feel like this is more commonplace. also  if this guy was attractive and 35 and she was into him this would be a story of how they met and it would be  romantic.
@telethea the end bringer  not gonna lie  but I initially thought that meant cancel his life account  not twitter account.
@dave mcduringo  no one is  mobbing him.   while youre lying there on your fainting couch  see if you can figure out the difference between mobbing someone and what is actually happening in this conversation.
@rlh125  wtf is a  has
@blox117  its a typo  as you know very well. youre just hoping to distract from your shocking ignorance. it wont work.
with malicious intent!
big mean dog helps too!
melons go brrrrr
just trying to picture melonie with a shotty sarah connor style lol  I can see her more with a hand gun like lara. but yeah hope she s safe.
@mkf30  double sawed-off shottys kicking ass and taking names.
she ain t gonna let you smash for saying shit like that bro
@micah ornelas  haha  thought you were going to say kicking ass and chewing bubble gum
@mkf30   bro  I was watching  they live  a few weeks ago!
so why is she advertising it go to the police ching ching more views
@jack sparrow  why do watch this channel  jack   you seem lonely and angry.
@micah ornelas  probably because he thought she was different than the typical modern feminist woman  but look at her here acting just like one. why dont you admit that
@jack sparrow  are you that asians in the library chick of youtube fame
@micah ornelas  lmao nice! ah a classic.
@mrthou  what ! whatever
@micah ornelas  okay sweetie sorry I upset you.
@jack sparrow   its okay  just make sure it doesnt happen again.
go boom frfr
make sure your gun s jamaican. buck shot  buck shot  buck shot!
best comment ever.
I got a shotgun!!!!
boomstick
no get a less than lethal gun. also would you complain if the stalker was henry cavil
there is a song called   melonie by weird al yankovic about a stalker very funny lol
@mkf30  Imyself see melanie with duel 50 caliber machine guns!!!
@napoleon bonaparte  less lethal  if someone wishes me harm  I want the most lethal possible.and harassment is all contingent upon the reciprocal desire of the communication. if the target has made it known they re willing to speak on friendly terms with you  and hasn t made it clear that they wish to be left alone  its not stalking or harassment. so if it was henry cavil  presumably the contact wouldn t be harassment. or maybe it would. thats for the person  melonie  to decide  not the identity of the stalker.
@jack sparrow  the police wont do shit
@surreal resonance  what makes you think that was the plan  projecting
with malicious intent.
according to dave chappelle...dont forget to load it with birdshot  buckshot  birdshot  buckshot  buckshot  buckshot
just a quick observation she seems like she lives in a liberal state so doubt she could legally own a firearm even if she wanted one
Im so sorry you have to deal with this creep! hope this gets resolved asap! stay safe my friend
lol at chrissie mayr - trying to add levity to a rough situation. Im sure she is very supportive.
be careful melonie  people can be crazy. especially if they re crazy enough to stalk.
he should be thanking you for not going all sonya blade on his ass. seriously glad youre safe my friend!  its incredible how this wonderful community has each other s backs!  stay safe and have  a happy new year melonie!!
hope this issue gets solved promptly. my friend had the same unfortunate experience and it was solved rather quickly with her calling the police  handing in evidence and them having a talk with the stalker afterwards at the police station. he got the message.
the sad thing for me is that despite feeling discussed by this and I hope nothing happens to u because im a fan of ur content when I was younger I did find myself being sort of a stalkers myself because of the ubique circumstances I grew up in. however as I got older I learnt what I was doing was wrong and became a better person
I cant imagine what it is like as a woman.  I had a female stalker that was relentless.  made about 20 social media accounts to get to me and began stalking me through my friends too. stay safe!
Im glad youre safe. honestly  I thought you looked like youre in your twenties. you have a fountain of youth secret. kudos!
Ive dealt with stalkers  even having to go to court because of it. file a restraining order immediately. report him on every social media site. treat all of this as evidence for a court case  because thats most likely where its going to end up. I also wouldn t post this publicly  as his attorneys might use this against you. you dont owe an explanation to anyone. keep everything about this private  keep records  and keep safe.
unfortunately  blocking his accounts on twitter just confirms youre aware of him. this sounds like a person for whom any attention in any form will only reinforce his delusions. muting his accounts might be better since there s no way to know when someone mutes you on twitter.stay safe  melonie! I will definitely pray for you.
ugh! Im so sorry youre going through this melonie! thank goodness those guys walked you to your car!
you are a very beautiful  smart  and talented young lady. you will likely amass lots of admirers as your channel continues to grow  but along with the territory comes the loonies that take that admiration too far. always be careful and vigilant.
glad youre feeling better and back to great health! really hope this doesnt get worse for you  people are so nuts. stay safe please.
stay safe  be careful. as a man  Imight never know what this feels like. but  as an older man  I always think about if something I post might be read as creepy or something. this man was stalking you  believing someone you dont know would be into you is very scary.
megyn kelly once explained that mentally unstable people are particularly susceptible to habits of stalking tv anchors and now yt ers since their perception of reality are already unanchored from actual reality and the job involves speaking into the camera and the crazies get the impression that youre looking them in the eyes and that an actual relationship exists.  its actually quite terrifying that they view all your content as though its a one on one conversation.
glad youre safe melonie  that guy is very delusional and obsessive.ps Ive been a fan sub for a few months now  but I dont often comment. have a great day.
im glad youre being careful  they are some weirdos out there. take care melonie  I hope everything gets better and you dont have to deal with this situation anymore
Im really sad to hear this  be strong and hopefully everything works out for you
being a disabled person  I know what it feels like to be hopeless and feel defenseless  but I will say Im sorry you had somebody stalking you specially somebody that looks as creepy as he does but that doesnt justify the fact that he thought that you were going to be his wife as weird and creepy by itself anyway piece of advice always have somebody with you at all times because you always have to protect yourself no matter what you make some wonderful content and you help a lot of people which is a good thing  so make sure that you protect yourself for sure. make sure thatsomebody is always there with you.
hey mel!  glad to see you are feeling better and that your safe. lot s of love   from south africa
she is amazing  and yes  she has been in contact with me behind the scenes being very supportive
crazy enough to stalk and vlog it
@joseph balinski  I had a creepy chick stalk me for a while  it can be very invasive and makes you look behind your shoulder every day.
people be acting wild nowadays  its getting ridiculous
im going outside...... to stalk..... lenny and carl.
4rillah.
the simping in this comment section is out of control.  dude she just need to get a gun.  end of the story.
this guy seems a bit unhinged alright.  so since he seems to easily swing from love to hate in the space of a day he s already dangerous.  this guy doesnt even know his own mind. going from saying mel is his future wife to saying she s basically damaged goods thats a classic sign of someone in need of psychiatric help  big time
@chance wilkerson   its not now days this ahs gone on forever obsession is nothing new but its never been ok
@mikepette  dummy hate isnt the opposite of love. indifference is the opposite.
@mikepette  this is literally the reason why we should legalize guns. here in the netherlands even a taser is banned so get your booty ready for grapes cuz ain t nobody gonna save you!
definitely. people sometimes forget just what people are really capable of.
@virtualholocaust  facts
I remember a undertaker  wwe wrestler  story about a crazy goth or satanic chick that was stalking him and gave him a container with her blood in it. I guess if you have stalker fans it means you ve made it.
its scary regardless of gender.
@elongated man forever  gender
you can become one these days.
@first last  Im saying women aren t the only ones dealing with that.
private my ass. she isn t some nobody. stalkers dont care about restraining orders. the best thing she can do is put as much light as possible on it. make the person known. Ive had a stalker. to the point I was assaulted while drunk after she broke into my apartment. dont stay quiet.
@cult of odin  we have to deal with the reality of the situation. we know the legal system is not always fair  especially with activist judges. the more info she makes public  the more ammo this guy s attorney has to use against her  either as defamation  or to say she s using this to get clicks and therefore not really threatened. this is a legal matter  and as such  I would keep it out of the public. just as you wouldn t comment on a court case publicly  I wouldn t comment on this either  if it were me. as far as a restraining order  you need to file that to keep it legal and keep a legal record of when it goes to court. if she doesnt file a restraining order  thats the first thing the opposing attorney is going to attack. and sorry that that happened to you. I know what its like to have stalkers  and I know what its like to be threatened. its a horrible situation to be in.
@leo zaccari  that may not be an issue here as I believe she lives in texas.
@leo zaccari  meaning the judges are probably not activists for the most part.  not a guarantee   though.
@varanid9  let s hope so  but texas isn t as red as you think. it all depends on what part of texas. the major cities like dallas  fort worth  and houston  are blue as they receive a ton of federal aid and have therefore been corrupted. I pray that youre right though.
are you the guy stalking her is that why u want her to keep it private lol
sorry  solid disagree.
@leo zaccari  fort worth blue  now I know you have no idea what youre talking about. also restraining orders usually make things worse  sometimes the best way to deal with a stalker is ignore them. if that doesnt work  carry a gun.
@cult of odin  spoken like someone who knows nothing of the laws
@billy batson  a restraining order is necessary to legally document the harassment and its vitally important because if he should violate said restraining order  melonie pretty much has an easy case when it goes to court. no restraining order would give this guy s attorney an advantage in court. also billy batson  your shazam movie was garbage.
@noah hastings  I agree with the second part.
@cult of odin  the restraining order isn t mean to stop him. its meant to lock him up when he violates it. he may not care about restraining orders  but cops sure do.
@everweed420  are you incapable of reading to understand the reasons why itshould be kept private
@crazychase98  agreed!
@varanid9  I am not in favor of using nukes  unless they could selectively target people  like some kind of video game.
@lunarcide  well   its probably been that way for 2 hundred years.
@leo zaccari  sorry   thats not possible.
pretty eazy when you dont have any friends
good point. they think thatshe is talking to them personally.
wow  I hadn t thought about it like that. thats scary.
thats frightening.
@al malone  he must touch grass and snap right back to reality.
@nico james  actually funny little fact reparations was debated on twice in the government. the first time was after the civil war and was shot down because it was believed doing so would make race relations much worse than they already where. the second time was when the civil rights movement was gaining steam and a few states promised to pay reparations if they shut down the protests. the civil rights leadership at the time unanimously said no in favor of well  constitutional civil rights. so america tried at least
its called parasocial. its why I dont bother to do vids. I get too annoyed at people who act like they re friends with you because they watched some of your crap. I also get too self conscious   start insulting myself for talking to a damn camera.
why is megyn kelly crazysplaining
welcome to schizo world
@max master j  so it has nothing to do with you not being very entertaining
@God  she had a stalker. had to confront in criminal court.
@brian neu  so that makes her as a crazy expert  thatshe cantalk about it as a matter of fact
@God  so you have to be an expert on a given subject in order to state relevant facts  when someone tells you that 2 2 is 4  do you ask if he is a mathematician  a claim is either a fact  or it isn t  regardless of the identity of its bearer. anyone can relay a fact to anyone else.
@grotesque head  your example is dumb because thats basic arethmetic taught on school for children lol. it is to a point basic math as a common knowledgenow mental health aint basic mathtry again
believing someone is your future wife or husband without even having met them  getting to know them or most importantly dating them first is a delution for sure. acting creepy aslo wont win you points with anyone. stay safe miss mac.
its messed up that this happened to you. glad youre alright. no weapon fashioned against you shall prosper  and though I pray it never comes to it  every weapon fashioned that you own will not miss their mark.
sorry to hear this. I hope this gets sorted out and you are safe. I only just started following your channel after learning you were promoted by the fandom collective and seeing you talk tomb raider with critical drinker. I dont want anything bad happening to you. if you need a break  take a break. we are on your schedule. dont let the creeps bring you down.
wow  this is about the seventh time one of the people I follow online that is a woman has come out with a stalking story this year. I have a daughter that I would like to see one day make it as an influencer but now I am questioning whether that is a good idea now.
holy crap  mel.  please be careful.  that guy is a a nut.  we are all so happy you have good folks to stick with you to make sure you get home safe.
glad youre okay. hopefully guy gets help or at least put away so he cant hurt anyone.
I just saw yellow flash s video about it. I am glad to see you are ok and doing well. that creep needs to get some serious counseling or something.
Im glad youre ok  mel. what a creep  Im glad you got help.
glad to hear that youre back in good health  dehydration is no joke! also  congrats on 100k subscribers
sounds like a very surreal and eye opening experience to say the least  mental instability is no joke  I hope he gets the help he needs  but more importantly I hope for your well-being the situation is brought to an effective end and soon. be safe out there
glad your safe  it really crap that people like him exist with that delusion and its a pitty that is how they act out. it happens to alot of girls and guys too  and its great that you are speaking out about it.  we shouldn t have to live in a world where we are looking over our shoulder all the time.  Im alway fetching my wife from her work even tho she can walk home and we are in a safe area but in our home country it was so bad that  and yea I cant even explain what happened.   stay safe and hope you and your viewers are safe during the new years. have a good one
holy shit  dude. youreally seem composed like a boss considering how f  ked up this guy and his awfulness has been  so mad kudos for being such a badass.fyI the youtuber nexpo has a video about experiencing stalking and online abusers. I dont know the man personally  but perhaps nexpo could offer some helpful advice  its such damnable situation to be in.glad youre safe miss mac.
glad youre doing well melonie. we re praying for you
God bless chivalry! happy you had company at the convention and then those guys making sure you were ok
major respect to the two guys who walked you to your car. chivalry used to be common  but nowadays its rare. so sad.
heard about you from thequartering. your content is pretty dope. hoping this passes over. I couldn t imagine my cousins or future daughter having to deal with that without me losing my sh it on the stalker. praying you stay safe but never leave it in the hands of God. got to keep that  for guaranteed protection
hey melonie.  just been following you for a short time.  but I pray you stay safe from this guy.  no one deserves to have to go through something like this.  really like your channel.  God bless
sorry u went   going through this ordeal. glad to see ur safe my sister. also glad to hear youre taking precautions  i.e. carrying your pistol and notifying the authorities  .
glad youre being proactive in talking to the police and letting people know about what this guy is doing. stay safe
stay safe melanie  my thoughts and prayers be with you
delusion is the word youre after
@innominata  hahaha thanks wow that was a noob mistake
evidence timestamp  please.
you ve clearly never heard of arranged marriages.
@john sampson  yup  there s basically two types  arranged and forced. in an arranged marriage  both the bride and the groom consent to have their marriage arranged.  which is fine since they basically get to know each other and like each other . in a forced marriage  one or both of them is coerced into the marriage and does not give full  free consent and that is wrong and delusional.
@jaybee  youre wrong on the arranged marriage part.  arranged marriages in many cultures are arranged by the parents of either the bride or groom.  consent by the couple is rarely even considered in their decision.
something
saw it too.
in the military it used to be called a wall to wall counseling.
fast metal propelled by tiny explosions counseling
@shawn m could have something to do with the more rabid variety of feminists who get offended and chastise men who behave that way towards women.
timestamp for evidence  or is it reeeetoo
I saw on twitter that melonie says the police are taking care of this. thats good to know. Im a bit far away  but Im sure Im not the only one who d like to take care of this guy in a way the police wouldn t like.
this is terrifying melonie. thank God those lovely guys walked you to your car. keep safe. stay vigilant.
probably a good idea to always have a couple guys you trust walk you in and out of places like this. good on you for having a fire arm.  make sure to put in proper range time. get with a trainer that cantake you through a few tactical scenarios. its important to know what to do when places into stressful situations when you also need to grab your fire arm.   glad youre ok. God bless.
sad this effect of the internet doesnt get researched more. people are more lonely now with the internet than we have ever been. be safe y all  glad melonie was and Im sad for this dude because he seems like someone who doesnt understand internet etiquette and I think he believes he honestly got his heart broken.
thank God for melonie. she is the best. such a great tr player and such a nice person.
Ive been a security guard for a lot of places  but one of those jobs I worked in downtown slc and even though slc isn t a big city by capitol city standards  we still have plenty of disgruntled  not quite sane people. had a girl who realized she was being followed and started trying to evade the guy who was following her when she ran right into one of our guards whom she informed of the situation  and he followed the man for awhile before informing him he had to gtfo the property  in friendlier terms  Im just projecting  and the guy spluttered for a moment  saying some bs about how he knew the girl and the guard shut him down and made sure he left then stayed with the girl till the police arrived. I sincerely hope that girl learned to pack heat after that  and got training which is arguably just as important   because if that man had gotten to her  well  plenty of people go missing every year  sometimes they find the bodies  sometimes they dont  but the cases where the person shows up alive are getting fewer and fewer.be prepared  be environmentally aware of your surroundings and always carry a firearm  preferably conceal carry so anyone who targets you doesnt know till its to late for them to do something about it  for those who dont know  someone who is committed to attacking you like a stalker will attack youregardless of whether or not you have a firearm  so if they know you have it  they ll plan for that  if they dont know  hopefully it ll be a nasty surprise.
definitely be safe it reminds me of thatsituation a few years ago when that guy tried to break into that female wrestlers house he had all kinds of stuff in a bag when they arrested him zip ties duct tape. that dude in particular was fully geared up for an abduction situation. so just stay safe
I am sorry to hear that you are going through this. that is stressful and scary.
very sorry you going through thatsituation. be vigilant and be safe.
glad to hear you exercise your rights for your protection.  not sure what your proficiency is or what training you ve had but every little bit helps.  its something I should work on more myself.  Ive got lots of target practice over the 20  years Ive been into shooting recreationally but I should really get into some sort of practical tactical courses.  stay safe.
super crazy.. truly take care  make sure you have the correct protection  knife  spray  other people  conceal carry etc.. ..  good luck with this and I truly truly hope he gets the help he needs and you keep doing what you do cheers.
be careful. I had a friend who was modeling pictures for sexy instagram photos. had someone show up  beat her nearly to death and she was in the hospital for six months. she will never be the same  both physically and mentally. you gotta get armed  block anything that reveals your location  id  etc. install cameras  track everything... consider a good dog too.
quite the unfortunate series of events  thank goodness that your friends  and those maybe-new friends  were lookin  out for you!
Im glad to hear that there were some guys willing to walk you to your car. Im so sorry you have to deal with this period its absolute bullshit and its terrifying. just keep your eyes open at all times and be safe
that is crazy the lengths thatsome people will go because they think that you are their future wife or stuff like that. glad that you are doing everything you canto stay safe from crazies like him.
Im glad youre safe.  these folks dont care about you.  they only care about their feelings about you and if you get in the way of those feelings  things mayn t end well.  stay strapped because youre on your own and self-protection is the great equalizer.
my sister had a stalker who was a known creepy dude who stalked women actually show up at her job and confront her. she had to run to her boss s office and security was called and later police. he had been sending her letters to a p.o. box on her albums  she is a gospel artist . talking about how she would be his wife and they would move to russia and have children. he was told off by security at her church because he had been secretly coming to watch her sing. nothing can stop someone who is really this unhinged. take care
glad to know melonie is safe  but I also hope this dude gets help. these type of things a lot times have deeper issues  and usually the infatuation can go from melonie to someone else. before anything else happens  hopefully somehow this guy will get some help.
ugh  what a lousy situation. take your time and do what you need to be safe  we ll wait for your videos  they re worth it  .
Im glad youre feeling better and please be careful. praying for you!
I hope you had a wonderful  Christmas melonie.  an stay safe from this creepy dude. people really take stuff too far.
thing is  gun doesnt help if someone already has a weapon pointed at you  disables you  puts something in ur food and drink
@blox117  the gun is just a tool.  its a means of defense but not a guarantee.  other factors like situation awareness are vital.  keeping your face out of your phone when walking and paying attention to your surroundings. you d be surprised how many people walk around blissfully unaware of their surroundings.
@daniel kunkle  no kidding
not surprised.
maybe quit thirst trapping a bunch of lonely dudes
dudes need to get off the internet and snap back to reality.internet girls are not your wife.feel sorry for that girl.
@blox117  maybe become emotionally mature enough not to fall for a thirst trap.
@blox117  so being lonely is a justification pretty stupid take.
@oompa lumpus  kind of feels like society is broken  when some dude thinks because a pretty girl is speaking on youtube he should latch on to her. posting sexy pictures  is one thing  just doing game reviews and maybe some commentary is another. people are just sick!
we really need to re open a lot of the asylums
help   how about he helps himself out of his own delusions...  these people need to be handled.
into the slammer he must go.
@solocamo  damn it otto how dare you have lupus.
@thefinalsneed  they should put a public bounty on him and we can send some boys out to get him.
Im glad you are alright and glad that is getting handled by the authorities.
pay attention to your surroundings  the devil comes at us all in different ways.  take care of yourself  keep making videos because they help people.  peace and love y all . ps not a stalker  happily married since 2001 to my highschool sweetheart lol
you are not the only woman I hear having a stalker  we need to address mental health seriously. there are some sick people who spend an unhealthy amount of time in social media and have no job or hobbies to keep themselves busy. I hope you ll be able to sort this out. wishing you a happy new year in advance. take care  melonie
glad that you are safe  just keep your guard up  hopefully you get assistance from law enforcement and anything else to keep you safe. other than that glad you are doing better and hopefully things will work out for you in the future.
stay safe melonie  always be surrounded by people you know never go walking alone  in the dark  nobody should do that Im a dude and I would never go walking somewhere where its pitch black there s danger around every corner and people need to be prepared.
always have your own security at all public events  glad your ok
glad youre safe  luckily events transpired that protected you. glad gentlemen still exist that ll walk a lady to their car.
that man looks like he s been through alot of shit. I hope he gets the help he deserves.
I ll definitely be praying for you  girl. I dealt with stalker issues. usually  a restraining order and especially sending the cops to the stalker s home can put a stop to it.also  please keep hydrated
I am sorry to hear that you had go through such experience. stay safe and keep doing what youre doing.
yikes mel  Im so glad you are safe.. Im sorry you have to deal with the stress of someone elses  crazy. people are nuts in this world and its a shame. I really feel like the world is getting worse. people are getting worse.. I just hate that for you.
so sorry to hear about this. I hope it gets resolved and that you are alright.
I am very glad you are safe melonie!
those guys walking you to your car had to be guardian angels sent to keep you safe. and  firearms aside  dont forget your pepper spray.
those gents seem quite respectable  whomever they are Im certain they re happy youre okay
stay safe. I also have to commend you on your attitude. not wanting to get him fired  or cancelled speaks volumes about the type of person you are.
Im so glad that you gotten 2 guardian angels at the right time melonie.
hearing about stuff like this you think  but it doesnt happen to nice friendly people  and then it does. ugh. glad youre ok melonie. God s got you.
so glad youre safe. thats super crazy.
hope you can stay safe.the beauty and the flaw of youtube is the stars are relatable and reachable  as they are usually everyday people.Im sorry youre going through this  but hopefully it can be resolved quickly
what makes itsad is  this kinda level of creep was around long before social media was a thing.  all social media did was make it easier. there s an underlying issue here that we need to tackle but I dont know if we re ready to open that can of worms.
@abigail owens  no  stalking is not ok
@abigail owens  nah thats not men being men  being a stalker is genderless  there are equal amount of women stalker out there. because they are the  weaker sex  society is more lenient towards them when it comes to such behavior. also men dont report them as much.
oh yeah  they were real heroes
uhm  nice friendly people is who it happens to the most. they re usually vulnerable targets for predators did you think this only happened to people who were  asking for it
girl please be safe. praying for you. Im glad youre okay and those amazing gentlemen escorted you to your car!
hope youre doing and feeling better now  may God protect you and guide you safely. also congrats on 100k
be safe mel  this guy is insane. I saw this pop into my feed but haven t had time to watch it. I wished I had sooner  so I could give you some better advice than I already have. this makes me fearful for my daughter  though she is only 11. I fear for nut cases like this stalking her. its why Ive been trying to teach her self defense tactics. this guy needs to be arrested. he wont stop  and I say this as a former police officer. be careful mel.
narcissist stalkers are the worst. they dont like rejection or being told no. they will cyberstalk and when that is not working they start physically stalking. I know Im going through this with an old woman who doesnt want to leave me alone. she started with cyberstalking and now she goes to my church hoping I break no contact. its going on 2 years now. be safe and yes get the law involved.
glad you are safe melanie  stay safe.
glad youre carrying now.   just got a new shoulder holster.  love it..  hope this doesnt make you hesitate to go out.  dont let a scumbag take that away from you.
man God was definitely watching over you at that convention. so good to hear that there are good people out there that really look out for one another
glad to see youre doing okay  good on those chads for escorting you out of thatsituation.
you know you ve truly made it in life when people stalk you
sorry  to hear about your situation  no one deserves to fear for there life.  being medically retired military I am now natural paranoid in public so I conceal carry just for the piece of mind knowing Imost likely will never be in a situation  but just in case I have it.
is  follower  not already the definition of a stalker  Imean  some fans go so far  that it is nearly an obsession for the person. the step to be a stalker is small. I think it is the broad social media presence that attracts more of these psychologies.
so glad that youre taking this seriously  as itshould be. your safety is important and Im so happy that there are fellas out there that walked you to your car.
Im glad that God is keeping you safe during this whole ordeal and I just pray that it ends soon for you so you can get back to your normal life after dealing with being severely dehydrated.
at least the safety yellow clothes he wears makes it easy to spot him coming. also makes it easy to line up your sights on him. be safe and always carry.
I feel you. this happend to me many years ago with an older women and I am not even a public figure. all of this did end after I stopped blocking her fake accounts and just ignored her. because they see every action you take against them as confirmation of your approval. its good  that you are talking to the police now. be safe.
be safe  there are plenty of crazy people. having delt with that on 2 occasions. no matter who you are it can be unnerving since you never know how far they re willing to go. never ignore that kind of situation.
I hope that man gets to marry his future wife  even if its by force  true love cant be stopped
this is actually terrifying  not mean words online like pokimane is worried about. glad you are safe man.
stay safe melonie! you are in my prayers!
hope this goes well and you get out of this. pls protect yourself. this is also a lesson to please protect your loved ones and keep em safe.
Imean  they have stalkers too.
how come everything people like you say needs to include a dig at someone you dont like. pokI has stalkers too.
gladly youre safe and shall remain so  mel!     congrats on the 100k  btw
wow! this is nuts! thank God he put the right people around you to keep you safe from this dude!
there are some crazy people out there! glad nothing happened and hope you stay safe!
if you haven t already and are able to get a firearm for protection. Im so sorry that this happened to you. prayers to you!!!
take care of yourself and stay safe melonie  these people are straight up crazy  I know from my own experience
its very decent of you to ask people to not try and get him cancelled and such.  not a lot would do that.  more than likely he is in need of mental  emotional and spiritual help.  and if thats not your department  its not your department.  good on those men who had the conviction to make sure you were safe and in your vehicle.  be safe and be packin .
imagine waking up and not being sure what day it is and then still be convinced that your next thoughts are the best thing to act upon.
sorry to hear about the struggles. congratulations on hitting 100k
sounds like you finally  made it  - your first stalker feels like a milestone
glad youre safe melonie! Im sure its comforting that you have so many around to protect and support you.
if you dont already do so  I ll tell you what I constantly tell my little sister. always conceal carry. always! also  never get caught anywhere alone. stay near crowds as often as possible. please  stay safe and God bless.
thats some crazy stuff. be careful out there melonie. as my wife says  creepers be creepin . glad to hear you carry protection. just make sure you get some practice with it.
wishing you peace and safety. good move making it public.
Im glad you are okay. stay safe!
creepy guy. glad you had some back-up on the day.stay safe  dont let this walking talking disaster ruin anything .
this guy is the definition of crazy and dangerous  good to know youre ok melonie
stay safe girly. I ll keep you in prayers
it feels odd hitting the like button on a video of this nature... but there it is. hope this all works out well for you.
you dont look a day over 29.  f the haters ... and the stalkers.  be safe.
be careful  mel. these weirdos dont know the meaning of the word boundaries. Im praying for you.
yeah some strange shit happens to melonie.... also the dehydration....like how  she s living in america  where you can get a water bottle in every shop! its not the sahara desert.
@stijnvdv2  there are actual deserts in america... you know that  right  doesnt take much to get dehydrated even if youre in a city during a hot day  get dehydrated from a bad case of diarrhea  or have been working out at the gym. for people trying to build muscle and are on a routine  its especially easy to become dehydrated.
@tea burn  because she s clearly a bodybuilder... girl cant figure out to go to the police rather than reeeetooing a man without evidence to incite an internet mob  cant figure out to drink when she s thirsty... she s 36 years old!!! she should know better by now!!!
how is he dangerous  what dangerous thing he did   you and your false accusations
@kingtairun  you have no common sense obviously
@dekadin  you are metoo mob
@elongated man forever  yes he is weird  bizarre.. but why label him dangerous  to get him hurt or killed  I remember zoe quinn said her ex abused her which turned out to be a lie but her ex committed suicide because of that
@kingtairun  Im aware of that  but zoey quinn was repeatedly a toxic person I wouldn t say melanie has done anything malicious or spiteful but I could be wrong  Im open to a different perspective if its rooted in facts.
@elongated man forever  that is good. all I  m trying to say is lets not lynch this person on the account of being creepy fan. lets not act on one side accusations because if we do people like zoey quinn and amber heard will win. she and her fans were talking about kidnapping  when I researched it  it turned out that the guy was just in the area that is all and she got upset.
@kingtairun  it doesnt help though with those accounts he kept making  the dude should of just apologized to melanie and gotten it over with.
@elongated man forever  sure he is obsessed with her and that makes her uncapturable. but should she apologize about creating outrage and kidnaping accusations
@kingtairun  youre a more on
dont let this guy get in your head. just be safe and be careful with the information you out out there.
honestly  this  to me  shows how fragile mental health is at the moment. also explains the many troubled people on twitter and yes here  someone was clearly looking over you that day and well done to the lads for helping you out. I do hope the guy gets help and thats the end of it  theres times I know my mom is looking after me and making sure Im alright from heaven  I think in subtle ways we get guided in the right direction.
first  make sure youre watching your surroundings when youre out. I actually cheered when you said you have a gun and are carrying it. its like a movie where the character actually does what you would do! lol maybe if this dude knows you can punch his ticket  that will scare him off. second I think all of us rational guys know that the only signal you ve been sending us is that you want a good old school tomb raider game movie!
I know this is serious  but chrissie s reply to your twitter thread got me laughing pretty good.
again.  I am sorry that this happened to you.  keep the faith!  you are in my prayers.  I would suggest you block him by the one thing he cannot change.  because we do not know if he watches your streams  I will pass this to you via jeremy.  I do not want to give him any kind of help  just a lot of heartache  and take away his ability to stalk.   be safe  and stay real!!!
stay safe out there melonie. may the Lord keep you out of harm s way. God bless.
dude this is crazy! so sorry you had to go through this.
Im very worried for melonie. please protect yourself melonie! you are important to this world.
glad youre ok. stay safe.
for future reference- if you get weird fan letters left on your car or sent to your person addresses  etc.  dont throw them away. they could act as valuable evidence for the police  not only the contents of the message s  itself  but fingerprints and dna that could be on the messages as well.
itsucks that you have a stalker. one of those rare situations where being drop dead gorgeous and having a solid head on your shoulders isn t necessarily a good thing. stay safe out there lady!!!
sorry to hear this very unfortunate situation . itseems that problems always seem to arise in life  when you are at your most vulnerable   just like after being admitted to hospital . in situations like this   just keep strong and having a good network of  friends around you was good protection . the witcher series really has been terrible and difficult to watch   not surprising netflix cut it down from 6 to 4  episodes
while I empathise fully with the concern you must be feeling  at the same time  I cant help but feel sorry for the guy as well. sounds like he s got some wires crossed and thinks that he s right.
so glad youre okay  melonie
stay safe melonie.
what the flip! this dude is insane! stay safe out there and stay strapped just in case!
36 !!!! I thought youre 24  melonie. youreally take great care of yourself and have a wonderful new year.
it has happened to a lot of streamers  if I was a big streamer I d get a guard dog and get other legal protection. mentally unstable people act irrationally so take the steps so that you feel safe.
the trick  melonie  is to become the stalker. you cant be stalked if youre the one doing the stalking. find out where this guy lives and watch him from every dark corner possible.
melanie  something like this happened to my sister a while back   she made sure to document everything  she even kept horrible pictures that were sent to her thatshe gave to the police immediately . this was one of her best defenses against her stalker. screenshots  texts  recorded messages - all of it helped her situation.  it turns out he had a history of issues with other people  male   female  so the additional info provided by my sister allowed her to get a lifetime pfa against him  which actually worked - he s no longer an issue . above all else  please be careful out there - its hard to be anyone these days  but especially if you have a big internet  presence like you do. stay safe   be well in the new year
as a man I absolutely hate when other men behave in this manner. its shameful af  God be with you girl!!!!
stay safe and definitely work with the authorities to get this resolved.
stay safe...keep us updated cause to be honest...this was entertaining lol
as a Christian woman of superior character you are someone to look up to. you are a great person and Im glad to have found your sight. every one of your supporters need to look out for your safety and if anyone knows about this guy report it to the police.
glad that you are alright  stay safe
what a creepy and scary situation. hoping you stay safe out there melonie
men like this are the reason my family freaks out when I go out anywhere alone  even in my mid 30 s. please stay safe.
glad to see youre safe from this nutball  mel! I do hope you are practising your 2a rights  if you live in america at least! . protect yourself  stay safe!
a stalker is a sign of internet popularity.it comes with the territory  like a professional hazard.edit  stalking is admiration peppered with disconnection from reality.man might find himself on a better path when attending church.
having needed a restraining order for a wacko in the past  here s my advice  - document everything. dont throw away notes. screenshot every form of communication  note the date and time and circumstances. keep a file or an excel spreadsheet.- clearly tell him  no  and  go away  if you haven t already. if youremove all possible confusion  its impossible for him to argue ignorance against the charge of harassment.- carry a gun  yes. also train with the gun. stay skilled with it  and be ready to use it. I wouldn t recommend carrying in a bag or purse. have it ready on your belt and know how to draw quickly and fire. stay alert. take a class  and make sure you know the legal situations where lethal self defense is warranted in your state. make sure you comply with any legal licensing necessary  to avoid something coming back to bite you. fortunately women are generally more legally protected than men in these situations because its more reasonable to demonstrate an imminent threat of grave bodily harm.- file a restraining order if he doesnt stop immediately. mental illness is no excuse. the guy who was harassing me was also mentally ill. if anything  that makes the situation more scary  not less.- surround yourself with good men and dont go anywhere alone if you dont have to. dont be embarrassed to ask someone. embarrassment can get you killed. also learn when to not be nice to strangers. politeness can get you killed too.finally  pray. you know that one.
be safe. hope they catch him. have a great day!
praying for you to stay safe melonie.
I d lay low for a bit  at least on social media. dont feel bad about not posting content  your safety is more important. anyone that drives that far to stalk someone is potentially dangerous  so take extreme precautions.
thatsucks mel  I hope youremain safe.
praying for your safety!
so sad you have to deal with any of this. stay safe and work to defend yourself.
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that I am so sorry that it happened to you. anyway hopefully you are doing well and better too. anyway I just wanted to tell you that the same thing happened to me back in summer of 2018 and 2019 when I was at my work at grocery store called kroger s in the town of lexington in state of kentucky and I was a bagger and I was bagging and I had a older man came up to me from behind and started touching my butt and rubbing my back and my head and I just told him to stop it and stay away from me and he didn t and kept doing it over and over until in summer of 2019 when he was in the store at my work when he came through my lane and I bag his groceries and I went to help other lanes when he came over to me and started doing it again and I yelled at him and told him to stop it and I told my store manager and store manager called the police and they came to arrest him and he is in jail for sexual assault on a young man  me  and he is spending time with no bail  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that you are not only person who is having this problem and I am so thankful and happy for you for being okay and not hurt. anyway next time you may want get a pepper spray to keep it with you that way you can have it with you in next time you get stop by a stranger who wants to hurt you that you dont know very well and you can us it on him to defeat him off so you can run away and yell for help and you cantell the police about it and you can have police go to catch this stalker person who is stalking you  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to tell you that and tell you that it has happened to me too and so I just wanted to tell you that I am so happy that you are okay and I hope you can get past this and move forward with your life and be free from the evil people in the world. anyway I am praying for you melonie. also may God bless you and may God watch over you too.. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie. God bless you too melonie.
honestly the dude needs some help. its sad how some people whom get so lonely can easilly become so obsessed with strangers they see online. contacting police is the best thing. hopefully they can find him and keep him away. sorry to hear about what you going through
wow  what a creepy insect! and seriously  I would say its funny that he thought he actually had a chance but there s nothing funny about him acting on these delusions. please stay safe! stalkers are like cucarachas  if there s one you can bet there s more. great vid
hey this is a member from ip2 at ip2always dot win. thank you for giving us the identity of that mask man. for your protection we re going to make this man a ip2 streamer. so if he does stalk you we ll have it on a live stream.you basically gloat to the world about having a stalker that actually met you in real life. unlike the other twitch youtube people who claim to have stalkers you are the first to have evidence in the form of picture  name  videos  he made to you  to back it up. congratulations
very disturbing. I have attracted the attention of some lunatics in my time   it can be very hard to predict what they can do.  itsounds like you are dealing with this in a very sensible way   have good self-protection instincts but please stay safe.
a good lesson to remember here - total strangers are not your friends.  regardless of them being celebs or youtubers of influencers  whether they  like  something you left as a comment  or have similar opinions on the world...these people are not your friends  they are complete strangers.
damn  you never know how strange people can be until you actually see it. you be safe girls seriously.
have you checked your car for apple airtags  samsung smarttags   or any other trackers they are super cheap  small  and easy to use which makes them common items for unsavory types to use for further stalking.
I cant say Ive gone through the same thing but itseems awful to go through. Im sure your surrounded by good people looking out for you  keep sensible  keep safe. I ll be praying that it gets resolved. oh  and pre-congratulations on reaching 100k subs!
the biggest shocker in this video is that youre 36. I could have sworn you were 25 or something. glad you are okay  though. stay safe!
stay safe melonie!
no worries mel  stay safe!
I d advise asking the con location to look through some of their security footage  if they had any of the parking lot  especially if your vehicle is visible. even get the police involved to ask for their cooperation. be safe.
yikes! dark side of the internet sadly  there are a lot of crazies out there. where there is one there could be two so I hope you are taking steps to be safe. knowing is half the battle yo joe!
so sorry this happened to you melonie. praying for your safety.
Im sorry to hear this happened. stay safe and God bless
until youre sure he s dealt with and you get some kind of notification back from the police  make sure youre going out with people as much as possible and that people know where you are  not online .
glad youre safe  I hope this guy has been dealt with by the police.
I already figured what this creep was gonna do  and Im glad to hear youre gonna start carrying your gun out there. hopefully sooner than later  the creeper gets thrown in jail. be very careful out there!!
36  I ll be honest I thought she was 22also the stalker thing is crazy. Ive never known anyone with a stalker and I never knew it could get this crazy. be safe.
I have friends that I carefully watch over against stuff like that. I even had my own creepy person experience. thankfully you were able to be safe and I hope that guy gets the justice and help he deserves. stay safe everybody
thats a level above the normal stalker. usually  they don  t publicize their desires and do things secretly. that guy s making a video journal for all to see lol! you also need a taser and one of those steel extending batons that could bruise flesh with just a light tap!
Im sorry to hear that happened. may God protect you always.
you know you ve made it when you ve got your own stalkers.  seriously though  be careful out there.
I think the millennial and post millennial world has issues with this...too much social media.  Im a late gen x er and our friends were all the real people around us  not the hot girl in san fran  and in nyc  and miamI  who are being supported by all the boys views.
be careful with that crazy stuff. God bless  melonie.
I hope no idea why this man up to. this is very disgusting and so disturbing! Im sorry have to go through like this. I hope you feel save out there and put this creepy man in jail for rest of his life!stay safe melonie mac.
at the car park he was deffo waiting for you  like you said what an odd time to just happen to be there  where you are.... fifteen hours away from his own gaff.  honestly  he d have probably been at that carpark an whole hour or more before the convention even began
make sure your social media doesnt contain anything that might give away your location. this is difficult since every app on your phone requires gps coordinates or current location. information that can be available to third parties.
I had a guy I knew when I was going to nyack college. he said to me that he knew this girl was his wife because he saw that in the dream that God showed him  but she was already engaged to another guy.I said to him sometimes dreams  or just our desires not meant to be interpreted as literal
damn am sorry you have to suffer from these insane guys and their delusional mental states. I hope you have a safer and healthier year than this.
praying God protects you and this person gets the help he needs.
stay hydrated  stay prayed up  stay vigilant  and stay strapped...
thanks for speaking out melonie - hope it may help any another woman.  will be praying for you. safety in numbers - Ive met arielle at vidcon  better discourse con and debatecon 1 and she is good people so Im glad you were around her and others. a local church or good relations with neighbors are good to have these shaky days. stay fly!
stay safe and aware  miss mac.
plz be careful. God definitely had his hand on your shoulder that night guiding you away from danger. you have such a positive energy that is very scarce in the world...its sad ppl like this guy exist. plz dont let his negativity outshine your positivity lol. stay safe!!
Im in the beginning of this video and idk you  alg recommended  but Ive heard its helpful to refer to them as  the stalker  and not  my stalker  bc they take pride in the association with you. best of luck. reached the end - subscribing
thats terrifying melonie  glad God was watching out for you!
sorry you are having to deal with this  stay safe. its sad that most women have a fear of all men and blame all men for this sort of stuff..there are some seriously deranged people out there..props to the guys who walked you to your car to make sure you were safe
awe melonie was sick  glad youre feeling better I just got over covid not fun...stay safe. Ive had online stalkers which is annoying  concerning but definitely dont want to imagine someone in person. definitely stay vigilant and be sure to get what you need to defend yourself. I always say when it comes to stalkers  crazies you are the law. cops wont care to tail you 24 7 you know  be safe.
mel I would warn you that  you need to be careful in these situations. Christina grimmie had also had a deranged fan  and  he took her life because she rejected him. please be careful and if you need to  be anywhere that is considered alone make sure to have someone with you. this world is crazy and the people are getting worse. stay safe.
I am sorry you went through this. I think you did the right thing by calling the police on both sides so that they both know police stations are aware. dont let this bad experience ruin what you have created. take this wirh stride. every great celebrity has a bad apple. great channel been watching it for awhile. happy new year.
stay safe my friend. I will keep you and your safety in my prayers. may the Lord keep you safe in all your travels.
Im glad youre feeling better!
jeez I cant believe your 36 I figured you were younger than that.  the stalker I can easily believe.  im truly sorry you are having to deal with all of this.  I wish you got to got have a good holiday season.  please be safe.
honestly  if it was an out-of-the way parking area that was kinda small  like she mentioned... he followed her there.
glad youre okay  and safe. hope the cops will be able to help catch this guy and settle this ordeal  never give up! we all rootin for ya!
this is disheartening news. glad you have some chivalrous fellas around you! keep playing itsmart  mel. God will always be by your side.
do what ever you need to be safe melonie.
damn.   I think youre a pretty gal  mel  but there s a distinct line between that  and what this psycho tried doing.   what in the actual f  k    just glad everything turned out alright.   take care there.  best be a little extra cautious for the time being.
sorry mel  stay safe from the crazies from england. have a happy new year
just a reminder to all that the word  fan  originated from the word  fanatic .  take care of yourself  melonie.
this is crazy! we got your back
that poor weirdo  I hope he gets himself figured out. you sound like you got it covered and you have a good group of friends.
thank God you are in texas too. you get to carry. glad youre safe  and hydrated. I had to get an iv at the start of december. wasn t absorbing water. Im better now too  just saying. jehovah-nissI  the Lord is our banner. he ll keep you safe. bless those one around you too  helping.
praying for you safety
youre being smart about this. please be safe.happy note  grats on the 100k!
it feels weird pushing the like button. hope everything works out for you.
Im glad the authorities are involved and hopefully this will be resolved soon. praying for your safety and for peace of mind.
I know youre well aware now that this guy could be dangerous and especially now that he s been rejected. Im assuming that you already carry a weapon if so youreally need to make sure you have it at the ready. things tend to happen when you aren t completely aware of your surroundings. Im sure youre plenty capable and cantake care of yourself.finished the video and heard you say that you do carry so thats great
that is crossing the line there. itseems he has this fantasy vision of you when youre nowhere near that kind of vision of his deluded world he lives in. you should remain close to your friends especially your male friends until he s put behind bars  because he clearly sounds like a lunatic.
welcome back melonie. we love you.  love is respect  please in Jesus name may you be safe from this evil man and may he be expelled permanently from your life.
glad to see you back  drink  plenty of  water.  we missed you
wow  scary stuff. prayers for your safety.
be careful  melonie. so glad you have family around right now. praying for your safety
stay strapped and stay safe melonie.
thank you jay
hopefully they will actually do something too.
melonie  Im glad you are armed. always be aware of your surroundings. also consult with an attorney. dont count on the police to protect you. God bless you.
your a pretty young lady so I believe ya given there are freaks out there. I will hope you will be safe. I tell my daughter all the time so I tell her to keep her head on a swivel.
I practically reacted by saying  spooky  in the voice of pauly shore. we re living in a crazy world  and there are alot of crazies out there. stay safe  melonie.
sorry that youre dealing with that  I can imagine it would be really off-putting to have to go through having a syalker. hopefully that guy gets his head right and talks to a shrink  or gets put in jail if he doesnt start thinking straight.
being a pretty and very kind likeable person will have its downsides at times.  while youre probably full of worry and maybe dread or anxiety  I hope youremember that its still a compliment to your character.   keep strong and go boom!
safety tips  1. you should think about hiring security. if you dont wanna spend the money  you could talk to security ahead of time and have them walk you to and from your car.. at the very least start having your guy friends tag along to events. the best way to scare off a predator is often just the presence of another man. 2. look into pepper spray  tazers  or even a gun if you feel the need.  dont take your safety lightly. talking to cops helps  but they might not always make it in time or do enough about it. edit  tazer guns are better than regular tazers. it allows you to shoot them from a distance. stay safe. we love you   God bless.
my wife works late Im the night at the hospital. although they have security guards  they dont really do anything. she left one time at work  and the exit area where they leave  there was abunch of guys on drugs approaching her thatscared the shit out of her and she was upset. I bought her a s w mp and classes on to how to safely use a fire arm. allot of people dont like that idea  but I would rather her make people uncomfortable then risk the chance of something terrible happening to her.
we love you young lady! stay safe! keep yourself armed!  2a  staystrapped  protectyourself
please be safe out there. Ive seen the  dark  side of this world doing security and was in the army. God bless and protect you.
I am terrible sorry about all this. I hope you are safe.
Im glad those guys were with ya. definitely an unnerving situation. the sort of thing to send shivers down your spine. keep safe  praying for you.
I am so very sorry that has happened to you melonie. I do hope that guy gets caught and arrested.
3 00 this got me an snl  matt foley van down by the river  vibe.  you did everything right.  you were not antagonistic.  it has been like this for decades ever since psychiatric hospitals lost funding.  as a result many of these people that are clinically schizophrenic are left unsupervised.  it is time to get a big dogo.
my wife had a similar stalker and this guy was crazy. his wife divorced him over it and he lost his job over it. we should have reported it but we didn t. he lost his house and finally moved a long way away and stopped bothering her.
have situational awareness at all times. happy new year
you have to be very careful I had a stalker who signed my mailing address up to spam and would create new phone numbers just to try and contact me but because I couldn t prove it was them doing it their was nothing the police could do even with a no contact order against them
glad youre safe girl
if you just let him kidnap you for a couple weeks maybe he ll be able to prove that you love him.and you ll both live happily ever after
life isn t a hallmark movie  this guy should know this at his age! apparently not... I thought melonie was in her mid-twenties! keep up the great work!
seems to be the parasocial relationship mixed with a clearly crazy guy. I really hope the authorities can help with this situation.
unfortunately  not much can be done until something bad happens.
@jjkhawaiian  sad but true. the law is a joke.
there s layers to how truly hilarious this is. most wont get it.
wtf.. this happened to my girlfriend as well. years ago.he came from another country and went to her work to ask her to marry him. eventually he got himself a restraining order.some people have some loose wires in the head. Im sure he has no idea that he s doing anything wrong though. he just needs help.
hope the police are able to keep track on this guy  and he gets whatever help he needs with his delusions. please stay safe yourself  and at this time  dont be afraid to fall back on the support your family and friends will no doubt be offering you. in moments like this  having the support of people you love and who care for you is most vital. keep safe.
this might be more common than you think  like similar situations happen to streamers going to twitch con for example. its weird yes but I dont think there s grounds for stalking charges or even a restraining order. unless this dude goes to ur address and follows u everywhere you go  then yes then it would be stalking. in the meantime  make sure ur home is secure  be vigilant  maybe get a gun and some gun training.
I hope this guy gets some very thorough professional help.he s going to need it after 4chan is done with him.
please stay safe dear have someone walk you to your car and try not to be alone when out and about
be careful out there  melonie. its good to hear that youre talking with police about this guy.
I just found this woman and she already has stalkers. never would have guessed we are the same age
stay safe out there mel! glad you are back!
this guy is twice your age. what the frank man  he needs a strong intervention.. in a few ways.  stay frosty and always plan your exits. keep pom and zappy with you at a minimum. remember  if anything goes sideways and you happen to be alone  you are your own responder. fight dirty and use your tools.  please dont put your lethal in a purse lol  always on you
sorry you went through that. but hopefully  there s something to learn from all this. based on my watching  I learned why even if Im no feminist myself or agree with them always  I now see why they say what they say and do what they do when the topic is men and comfort towards.  men like your stalker will make almost even the most lenient  tolerant and patient women in the world uncomfortable and even scared.
melonie  as someone who has dealt with a stalker who moved across the country to follow me  no  thats not an exaggeration  she s beyond creepy  take screenshots and time stamps of everything for the inevitable court case.
I discovered you through jeremy of the  quartering  fame. you seem really based and awesome  I enjoy your content. I am not the type to comment publicly often  but you are very courageous and have done nothing wrong. I respect your take on this. it is a sad thing  to see guys like this. while there is no excuse  I believe we will see more guys like this thanks to modern society  toxic-feminism and a general lack of options for many men today. it is not an excuse  just an observation of current trends in society. one need only look to the results of the mouse experiments to see how what is happening to current society at large resembles those experiments. again  this is no fault of your own. just a sad reminder of the frality of the human spirit in a broken society. God bless you and be safe!
be overly cautious about this melonie. if this dude is determined enough to drive 15 hours  he s dangerous. even more so now that he likely feels rejected.  I ll be praying for you.
a little advice for the stalker guy. join groups in your own location. do something to make ties and friendships around your town. church  bingo  paintball  martial arts  archery  carpentry classes  or whatever else you can find. thats how you meet people. internet personalities aren t really real. they re nice and have common interest  but they re disconnected from viewers on a personal level for a reason. mainly for their own protection.now shoo! shoo! go home and be a townsman!
you should purchase a gun and carrier it daily! take care  be careful out there! Im glad nothing happened as well sounds like a close call! okay Im glad some other people said carry a gun too I didn t watch the whole video when I commented first time  but Im glad you do have one!
congratulations  on getting your first stalker it means you have made it as a famous youtuber. buy a gun an get your carry license.
I dont understand why people mess with people like this I hope your ok
I am so very sorry to hear. you keep safe and be very careful. my prayers are with you.
praying for you!
good to hear your okay from medical and now that your carrying. if you haven t taken a defensive handgun course I recommend checking out uscca or nra for instructors within your area to help you be better prepared defensively.  firearms instructor
I really dont mean to alarm you  even though this is a really bad situation  but it usually doesnt end well for the stalked. this needs to be dealt with quickly and by professionals. I hope you have a ccw. never  never go anywhere alone anymore.
always keep your wits about you  dont put yourself into any sticky situations
keep up the great work on your channel  keep hustling stay safe
btdubs  I absolutely love your strawberry shortcake sweatshirt! love 80s throwback gear!
glad you are safe and stay safe
praying for your safety  mel. glad youre back and feeling better. also  congratulations on getting to 100k subscribers on your go boom channel!
stay safe  mel!
I pray that God helps that man to be better and definitely helps you to stay safe and mentally prepared
protect yourself!! stay safe!! yeah that goes for all ladies out there!!
when the lifetime stories get a bit too real Im glad youre safe. get a hand gun.
I do hope that you stay safe because there are all kinda of crepes out there.
happy to see you feeling better! I d be careful about giving to much attention to guys like this. sometimes stalkers take it the wrong way  and use it as a way to justify increased pursuits. they tend to process messages differently than normal people.
be safe melonie x
Im happy the God was watching over you. thats a scary thing to happen. I couldn t imagine. lighter note. I hope you and well everybody in this comment section has a happy new year!
I have a long history of stalkers.  glad that you are safe.
if I was within 27 hours drive Imight stalk mel too. but the voices tell me driving anything more than 27 hours is just crazy.anyway... Ive got a craigslist stripper to go bury. merry Christmass!
Im a single dad of 3 teen daughters... this crap terrifies me...  glad youre doing ok... sheesh...
Im glad your friends made sure u got to your car safe!keep bringing someone with you  friends or family anywhere you go  even if its to the store for now. if anything maybe see if someone can be private security for you at any future events. pay them a monies for the day to be safe!super glad you are okay!  3
he was not a stalker  we was just following his dreams.....and they just so happened to be about you
I am so sorry this happened to you. I guess I should have been leaving you comments b4 this incident   just figured my comments would be lost in the background  etc. anyway  will try harder to post my ongoing support for you !!! everything you say cuts straight to the true heart of the matter! your a common sense barometer!!! so many battles to fight it gets overwhelming at times. but I suspect thats not a coincidence on  their  part. so those of us who agree with you need to do a better job of supporting you   and those who put themselves on the frontline vs the insanity! I ll be praying for you ! glad your safe and that it played out the way it did. btw . . . my mom calls that a gdc. a God directed coincidence!   feel free to use that   pretty sure she hasn t  tm ed it  lol
I really hope you dont live alone  creeps like to hide in single ladies houses  please have someone move in for awhile with you if you do  and get a pair of big dogs and cats to have patrol the house
youre 36   !! wow  you have a great combination of good genes  self care and discipline!
thats messed up! stay safe mel
sorry to see this happen to you mel. this person is clearly insane   clearly needs help. nobody should ever have to deal with this. I hope this guy gets what he deserves. its pretty sad that this guy has nothing better to do in his life than to stalk you. stay safe melonie. sending you lots of love.
I guess I ll pray for this dude.
glad youre safe. that guy is nuts! youre a beautiful woman  no question about that  but I dont see you as my future wife nor even a potential girlfriend. I just see you as a cool person  one of my favorite youtubers and a fellow believer. from what you showed us in this video  it looks like that guy is also one of those types who cant take  no  for an answer. he should get some serious help.
pretty sure youre the future wife of that life-size lara croft doll.seriously though  glad youre doing relatively okay and handling this.
love your content   I love you  mel! thank heavens for the 2 guys that walked you to car. had they not have been there  this situation could ve been much  much worse! this is a 150  a sicko! a sicko! he gives great guys like myself a bad reputation! Im so glad that you are safe   sound! and your surrounded by people who love you. youre 1 of the good people on youtube that brings positive vibes to everyone   everything that you touch just by being yourself! keep on  rocking    keep on  booming !
be praying for your safety sweetheart
I hope you stay safe. prayers and thoughts. side note. cowboy hat over here is making the rest of us fans look bad!! Im a fan of a lot of people. never drove cross country to go stalker mode. stay safe melonie!! omg.
well at least you got some viral content out of it  never let an opportunity pass you by.
that guy went from zero to scary real fast.
wow. stay safe! I think in most states you can carry pepper spray  and this might be enough evidence for a ccw.
glad your safe! God  bless
I hate stalkers.  stay safe melanie.
ive had to deal with a crazy stalker from 2019-2020 and the police didnt do f ck all. sent them tons of evidence  they admitted it was criminal behavior...and they still didnt want to do anything  even outright refused to let me file a criminal complaint.... made me lose all respect for their profession. hope they help you out miss  because I know this can be horrifying and such a drain on your mental health. wishing you a healthy and happy 2023.
there is just so much material here so not making light  glad youre okay from the dehydration thing and this dude.if this guy talked about divorces  knew which car to leave a note on he must have paid for multiple people searches.I didn t know they list car registration but not surprising when we give apps all our info all the time.you better check your car for some ebay bought magnetic gps tracker.I assume they sell them  bought some lasers but never some of that crazy stuff  fbI knows who s buying what on facebook  ebay  etc.thanks for sharing  glad youre safe. and sounds like you handled it like a pro.
so youre saying dont do that  or...  in all seriousness  Im glad you had good people around you that kept you safe.
dude  hopefully he didn t follow you home. upgrade your home security  get more dogs  etc. stay safe  and happy new year
if you live in the us there are multiple different entities who you could talk to if the police for some reason refuse to take a criminal complaint. there is a sheriff for your county  there is a highway patrol for you state region  there is the district attorney itself  who actually tries cases anyway     there may even be other police stations depending on the size of your city. now  all of those people  other than the last   are likely to first respond by telling you to go to the police   file a report  but politely explain what happened with the police   exactly what they said  not paraphrasing or anything but virtually verbatim.
are you a dude
which means what  @blox117  you seem desperate to defend this guy.
stay on your pivot melonie
oh crap she found me... oh wait thats not me! whew...close one.  slinks back into the fort he made in melony s trash bin .joking aside  stay safe. dont fall for it if he shows up outside your window with a boom box over his head  playing romantic 80s music.
welcome back glad you feeling better but your first video back is you having a stalker...im very concerned about u and  your safety. be careful and stay strong
that kind of looks like the strawberry shortcake vector art that I did for hallmark bandaI years ago as part of a ss ad campaign. if it is my art  Im surprised it got turned into a sweatshirt. I was told it would be for greeting cards.
I wouldn t blame you if you decided to get strapped with a concealed carry. stay safe and stay hydrated.
now you know how I felt when you were stalking me.
you did the right thing by exposing the situation and showing this guys face. you should be fine from here on in.
stay safe. but honestly by putting their photo up it couldbe giving them the attention they were after to begin with. so this could potentially lead to it happening moreoften. or not its a 50 50 if they want their face plastered on the web as stalkers
keep all the vids  submit these to your local so county  or pd municipality .  any letters or pictures give them to the leo handling your case. start telling a family or  good  friend your locations if you are going alone  if you do go alone start having a friend or family go with you. because if they see you with someone itstart detering while your locals can find out his location. if you find his name  go to your county clerk and file for a no contact order. if you are in anyway afraid or worried any so pd or fire-department will allow you to stay till you feel safe. an they can also do courtesy checks or walk you to your vehicle. your safety is paramount..
that gentleman needs professional therapy stat. stay safe  melonie.
Im sorry this happened. those where some good dudes with you. freaking weirdos out there.
keep safe mel happy new yearz.
the fact that he documented this  made a video about you being  his future wife  means for him it was almost like divine calling. and that means he s a 100  not well in the head. its complete delusions. I have no idea what can be done as far as the authorities but I hope the police are watching him. at least have them show up and tell him youre not interested. by making this video at least youre making sure for him to know that you are not interested and considering him a stalker. I hope he at least gets the message.
the sad part is the police wont do anything about until the stalker takes action
glad that you are ok. I think I can speak for everyone  and only on this topic  stalkers make my skin and everyone else s skin crawl
wow!  thats....... disturbing.  I remember when I was a teenager in high school and a young 20 something year old kid in college  I used to have a crush on any pretty girl in a skirt and would think one of them would become my wife someday.  I was still young that time and was still trying to figure women out.  but my God  I never did anything as creepy as this weirdo is doing.  at least Imade an effort to actually talk to the girls I liked and see if they like me back.  I never camped outside their house or whatever.  anyway  I hope the cops find this guy and lock him up.  this guy looks like he lives on the moon  if you get the rick and morty reference .  stay safe.
so what you ve gotta do is get a 2nd stalker and then tell them to fight over your love.  one will die and the other will go to prison.  two birds. one stone.
Im glad that you were protected and that nothing terrible happened to you  because its getting bad in many parts of this country. I am fully convinced that God has given america over to the  reprobate mind  paul talks about in romans 1 28. so  very little in the way of people acting crazy shocks me anymore. stay safe  and stay strong in the Lord.
I ll be praying for you!
19 05 he was definitely waiting there. he s an obsessed weirdo stalker.
I cant  for the life of me  figure out why you d even address his age dig. I was astounded to hear your real age. no b.s.  if someone had a gun to my head and said  guess her age   I would ve said 19  true story. regarding this kook s actions though  make sure you continue to follow up with law enforcement. once the crazy gets to the surveillance stage  its serious and not to be taken lightly. he s now in the  rebuffed affections  stage so I highly recommend you  do what you canto fast-track past the tro stage and move straight onto the protective order  the two are vastly different in efficacy . if you haven t already  I d report him to every platform he s posted on. I commend you for keeping a brave face  but  this is a life moment. dont let yourself become a segment in a tragic documentary. these guys are always harmless  until they re not
is it too soon for jokes   like I cant believe you didn t want to be the next mrs. burt gunner and hunt graboids  my first thought   dang Im thought I was the only lonely syco here. seriously  I am glad that you were able to identify this guy before he acted upon some creepy thoughts.
stay safe! never would of guessed your age. thought you were in your 20 s.
she hit the nail on the head. all that worked together cause God was watching over her..
knowing it was your car is creepy in its own right. I adore me some ariana grande  would love to meet her and have even dreamed of marrying her one day  but I have no idea what her car or house looks like  or where it would even be. its more of a   it d be cool if it happened in some strange turn of fate  type deal  which is how normal people look at celebrity crushes. if you are finding out their whereabouts for any reason other than seeing their performances  concerts  conventions  etc   then it does not matter if you want to marry  kill or have a coffee with them  its stalking. healthy people do not force themselves into situations another person has to deal with. they happen to meet someone they know about and shoot their shot  then go about their day when they are  most likely  rejected. thats why most relationships are between established friends or friends of friends  or strangers that met randomly. being creepy is going to land you in creep zone 9 times out of 10  and some of those also land you in jail where you belong. I hope this guy reads this comment  or any comment  or any conversation with concerned friends  and seeks therapy. more than that  I hope you stay safe because you are a gem.
stay vigilant and be safe
I hope he gets some help.  stay safe melonie.
welcome back good to see that youre doing well
hoping he never makes it near you again and is dealt with in a decisive manner without anyone else being hurt. yes  Im trying to be extra civil for youtube.
I am quite sure that there are many men out in the you tube world that would indeed love to have you as a wife due to your down to earth personality and inviting relatability. unfortunately a small portion of them to varying degrees ...are a bit unhinged so be aware at all times of your surroundings.take precautions like parking out in the open or maybe use the buddy system and carpool when going to and from events if possible and if by chance you keep seeing the same car while driving take a round about way or even pull into a busy place till you feel safe.  think it would be worth you time to do as much research on that kook as possible so you know where not to be or to get an idea o his past and future capabilities a criminal record  . keep asking our Lord to watch over you and your family...he always looks after us!  take care and God bless melonie
stay safe melony!
please be safe because I enjoy your content. but invest in a firearm or stun device  repellent of some sort and always be aware of your surroundings and the people you associate with. I know you probably do all these things already but you never know. enjoy the new year!
you did the right thing by staying in a group.  groups are safe.  having a gun is ok but being in a group with a gun is better.   Ive had three stalkers  maybe more  in my life.   the funniest one is when I came home from work and the cops had my house surrounded.  all my neighbors outside whatching what was going on so before I talked to the police I walked over to a neighbor I knew and asked him what was going on and he told me the older lady that lived down the road was living under my house! I was shocked because I had no idea.   after that I talked to the police and they confirmed what the neighbor told me and added she was retired from the navy  vet  and was having mental problems and they were going to take her to a psychiatric facility to get her some help.   I never met her I just hoped she was going to get help.   anyway  safety in groups.  be aware of your surroundings.
may God be with you on all your journeys to come this seems off topic but youremind me of hailee steinfeld anyways love your content and your firm foundation for Jesus  hope you stay safe out there  God bless you
stay strapped at all times and if you can get some security I d suggest that as well because this is very concerning.
please keep yourself safe young lady.
read  the gift of fear  melonie  restraining orders make things worse sometimes. stay safe
glad you are ok by the way we got the heads up from yellow flash dont know if you saw his video about this yet again just glad youre safe
creepy!... sorry to hear this  hopefully this helps embarrass him. and hopefully this gets taken care of by police.
much blessings to you and the Lord is with you
how does she live under the house
@blox117   she took blankets and pillows from her house and crawled under my house.  apparently had been their for a couple weeks before anyone noticed.
stay vigilant. I pray the Lord keeps you safe. there is a fellow youtuber called she protects herself you might want to check out. very useful info for folks in your situation. stay safe.
I suppose that monetizing your stalker is one way to make the best of it.
Im glad youre taking the appropriate precautions to this situation but it also adds to the point on why sane men dont prefer to play with women gamers. if a man wants to genuinely say kind words these sorry men make it hard. this is another reason why some men dont play or interact with women gamers. sorry for your situation
the good thing about him wearing that jacket is that you can see him coming from 100 yards away  day or night.
I hope he gets the message and moves on .
stalkers are not fun  Ive thankfully thrown the two I dealt with off my trail. hope you get that dealt with  be careful.
he s not a stalker  hes just simper saiyan.
there s a reason why more people dont go after that youtube money...they dont want to lose their anonymity
I d say now would be a good time to pick up a new hobby like boxing  karate  knife-throwing  fencing  archery  etc.something fun and interesting that also helps you protect yourself a little better.  also get a taser  pepper spray isn t always effective and can easily end up disabling yourself or others nearby on accident.
I would love to stalk you pretty lady .  joking aside stay safe and Im sorry to hear youre going through thatsituation
yikes. stay safe  melonie. God bless.
really dangerous situation.  get a ccw.  not sure what state youre in  but you ve reached ccw threat level.  hope you stay safe from that maniac.
this is crazy! stay safe.
Im glad you are safe. this story is really fucking creepy
what a nice 100k subscriber present!  stay safe.
I guess thats what happens when you become famous on the internet and you got all these stalkers on to you.
you can hear her fear. props to the dudes
always feel for the pretty and smart girls that constantly find themselves with stalkers. I always say that girls especially attractive ones need to conceal cary permits and to get a small gun and practice with it a bit. I d rather have a gun and not need one then really need one and not have it. but as a man Im much harder to kidnap or rape being 6 3 225 and all. but girls tend to be much shorter and weight much less making them easy targets to quickly grab and over take. be careful beautiful your a amazing soul who brings light to the world and have a great head on your shoulders.
arm yourself and learn to use it well mel. stay safe.
to be so close must have been terrifying.  holy shit  hope the cops catch this guy sooner rather than later.
at first I thought this guy was just some dude in a midlife crisis that has a crush on you but then the more you said in your video with him saying creepy things in your feed and opening up different accounts after you kicked him   and him putting a card on your car  that all together seems alittle wack!!! stay safe and protected!!!
glad your safe.
happy holidays  melonie. Im sorry this happened to you.
yeah  I wouldn t leave a creepy message on windshield  thats definitely a potentially dangerous stalker. hopefully you carry  you might end up needing it.
youre 36  all this time Ive been watching your videos I thought you were mid 20s! dont worry  I live in england and Im in the process of getting the woman of my dreams  from wisconsin who Imet playing eso over here. she was in a bad marriage and scared to leave but when we met in game we clicked.
we re in the matrix  its all a game  a thought experiment.  -erin valentI  utah tech ceo with no history of mental illness  found dead in backseat of own california rental car  days after going missing calling her parents   ------ 33yrs old  2019 october     she was researching computer-brain interface systems
those  nice conservative chivalrous men  could also be secret stalkers melonie! Im just saying dont trust them blindly just because they re younger and more good looking. be careful always. I would probably stalk you if I could lol. the difference is I would never have the courage to talk to you lul. I would just admire you in silence hidden in a bush.    lmao Im joking I would never actually stalk someone like that.
good luck with the stalker  mel. hope you got a weapon in case you need him to go boom.
be careful melonie  Ive heard about some pretty messed up stories when it comes to stalkers. I cant believe it fifteen hours  there are some men like us that chivalrous and honourable  and there are those that are crazy and messed up in the head. have your friends and family close in case this stalker gets any ideas.
the most shocking part of this video was finding out that melonie is 36.
15 hours ! that is true deeckee dedication!
be careful giving them attention can backfire. idk how to deal with this or what but good luck.
that is what you get for being pretty on the interwebz! nevet understood stalker mentality sounds crazy.
you need to make sure the police know about this guy  let the police know that you might need their help.
I was accused of being a stalker.   didn t even know the person.   they were  like   stay away from her  and I was  stay away from who    and all I got was   you know who .  I really hope I stayed away from her.
none of you have to do this  but I think it would be really great if streamers and other online influences banded together to lobby governments to take stalking more seriously.  imagine the sheer volume letters to representatives you could collectively generate by activating your audiences.
I heard stories of kidnappers leaving notes on the windshield and girls being taken when they get out to get it.chivalry and grouping up is a necessity.also  texas is ranked one of the lowest states in terms of mental treatment. stay strapped!
the story is scary af and I hope you get the full support of the police. now I have to point something out thatshocked me.. you are 36 y o    what!  you look 20! how  Im like wtf
two words  restraining order  the fact that the perp made a 40 minute video means that he s more than a little unhinged at this point.   what s even more disturbing with him showing up near you at a con is the fact that he may be also be doing active surveillance on you with how fast he seems to easily track you physically.   check for any suspicious vehicles in your area  match vehicles against the neighbors you know - and even go so far as to check vehicles that may seem to be tailing you for more than 3 blocks.   at the risk of being paranoid  also check for lojacks on your car  etc.   I wouldn t put it past the moron to somehow slip a location tracker tag on you.
glad youre safe love you on simpcast
aw what a sweet story  I pray you are able to get her to you swiftly
stay away from the summoner.
hope youre gonna be safe and okay melonie. you have a discord melonie
dont just carry the gun. take classes with the gun. if you ve taken classes before  which I wouldn t put it past melanie to have done  take them again.those are perishable skills that will get rusty. besides  what better time to feel like a bad ass again than now  be the lara.
well  I would make a bad joke that at least he s got good taste because youre gorgeous... but this is actually serious. you often seem oblivious to how attractive you are and your bubbly personality has an innocence about it that can set a guy like this off imagining more to a smile or a nice word or two than was obviously meant. it takes the fun out of life and means a guy like me wont even get a smile or nice word because you ll be afraid it will attract another lunatic after you. you stay safe melonie mac for all your fans and admirers. and  if you do have a gun  you do more than have it  you use it ok  this guy sounds like a legitimate threat and with our laws being what they are today leaving law enforcement pretty much helpless to act  you just be a bit more guarded and take care of yourself. keep your friends close
so sorry that this is happening to you have you got the police involved let s hope this person is investigated by the police just hope your safe
making this public is a good start  but also consider 1. hiring a bodyguard for public events.2. hiring a private investigator to help collect evidence.3. if you think he needs to be confronted about the staking use the police.4. lastly  if all else fails  study self defence and learn where the best spots are to hit and then aim for the groin and keep kicking until he is passed out.
I hope she s ok
if anything  learn self defense! def worth it!stay safe mel  and you almost at 100k  lets get you there and get you your silver play button!!hope you had a fantastic Christmas and may God be with you!
thats crazy  I hope it works out. police should at least look into it!
he even looks a  s.t.a.l.k.e.r.  from shadow of chernobyl. I bet he has some valuable artifacts in his pocket.
yikes... some people dont seem to understand the concept of internet entertainment. stay safe mel
if you dont compliment the guy people will label you as  full of yourself    unpleasant  and a lot other things.. but then you are nice and these weirdos pop up.. this is the kind of attitude thatshows why it is scarier for women out there. thankfully the guys walked you to your car and you were not left alone near that creep.
this is scary as f. stay safe.
be safe mel. gun  big protective dogs  two is better than one   conceal carrier permit  alarm system  protective order. I am a former leo  do not underestimate the potential danger of people like this  my friend had a female stalker and she escalated from car vandalism to attempting to set his house on fire at night with him in it.
time hasn t been kind to dsp
mel be safe and stay on the police. you just cannot trust people these days.
I heard horror stories with twitch streamers and stalkers. be safe.
the sad part is this is probably 20  of melonie s audience
make sure you have a firearm  mace  pepperspray  whatever you are comfortable carrying... sorry to hear youre going through that.
get a restraining order asap!
stay safe and keep some firearms handy just in case.
hey  yellow flash 2 did a topic two hours before you did this one saying he got busted  itshows how protective you guys are of one another and that he cares as Im sure many of your friends online do. yf2 says he was busted but maybe he means you shared the video Im just amazed to see how connected all of you seem to be and was glad to see him post about this as well. I think I ll share your video over on fb as the more eyes the better.keep us informed ok
learning self defense is not going to help a female take on a full grown man. if anything it just gives a false sense of confidence. carry a gun  weapon at all times  report it to the police  and dont be alone when out in public. which itseems she is already doing these things.
@cucker tarlson   self-defense isn t gonna help a female  you need to practice self-defense brilliant mind here
@cucker tarlson  false  not traveling alone is self-defense  carrying a gun is self-defense  and even documenting the person and their actions is a part of self defense. not going into places with less eyes on you and your potential attacker is literally a part of avoiding a situation to begin with. having more people around can deter a stalker because they re less likely to overwhelm the target. even in a concealed carry class  they tell you to be spatially aware to avoid having to be in a scenario to shoot someone. if you cant reach your gun and or youre alone  knowing some hand to hand makes you a harder target to subdue successfully  that doesnt mean become bruce lee.remember  youre the one who assumed what op meant by self-defense without considering what includes it. but even unarmed defense wouldn t be useless.
@trueafricanhero  well thats not what I was referring to. if thats what the op meant then fine. but its hard to know what exactly he was referring to based off that one sentence without making assumptions.
heavenly father  in Jesus  name  Im asking that all those in the faith community pray that you will keep melonie safe and secure  comfort her heart and give her wisdom to discern these things. melonie  you know you are now a recognizable public figure to many and this kind of thing comes with that territory unfortunately. keep your head on a swivel. always be critically aware of your environment and always stay within eye shot of your friends and have a friend or 2 with you in public restrooms. if you get a negative vib about anything  trust it even if it turns out to be not a threat. always better to be cautious and safe than clueless and sorry. shalom.
what a creepy! take care of yourself  melonie!
hope youre in a place where youre allowed to defend yourself. if so  be prepared and do so. do not rely on the cops at all
scary  I ll pray for ya let s hope it goes no further then being creepy.
melonie boom heard it mentioned in chat during a heelsvsbabyface stream. hugs.
good to see you back.also  100k!!!
I have started watching your content and really enjoy it thankyou
I am so sorry this happened to you.
its so sad that people like this guy exist.
be safe young lady and dont be afraid to take any action neccessary if you know what Imean...
he s probably here right now.
you know I just realized this kind of video can backfire in a way because it could inspire others to stalk you or even pretend to stalk you. because they see that you pay attention to them  that you are affected by them and could give them visibility.idk just something I thought about. I dont think you were wrong to do it  I just think it could have unintended consequences.
he doesnt seem like the type of dude to have the tech skills required to rapidly create social media accounts... he would need to be on a vpn changing his ip constantly and having bots create emails and accounts...Imean ya never know but thats typically gonna be somebody younger familiar with spamming social media ect...
glad you are safe
this is why I cant stand that twitter has such easy access to personalities. it puts everyone too close on a field.
well now Im truly jealous. the only stalker I ever get is the irs.
I got stage 4 lung cancer for Christmas that has spread into my spinal cord.  I wish all the true fans a merry Christmas and a happy new year.I will not go quietly into the good night.truth is my sword  honor is my shield  and the Lord is my savior.
wow! people are getting crazier all the time. there s some real weirdos on the internet. stay safe!
congrats on the 100kthis guy looks like he s on the brink and clearly unhealthy in his mindset watch your back mel
yeah with so many mentally disturbed people ...stuff like this is sadly sadly bound to happen. not to mention those people who are just in all sense of the word ...wrong!
hard to say. I dont think most people would sign up for this just to have thousands of people searching for their criminal records and everything else. I did this for my own safety because he would not stop harassing me  and sure enough this stopped him from contacting me again. the police will help too.
@melonie mac go boom  good to know itscared him and he stopped contacting you.    I was thinking if Im a small youtuber  I could pretend to stalk a big youtuber so that they advertise my channel. but youre right its probably not worth the publicity if tons of people are also gonna doxx you lol. I was being silly.
I lost my grampa to stage four lung cancer eight years ago! I can say all the sorries in the world for what youre going through  but I really want to say bless your heart my guy! keep fighting like the warrior you are my brother! much peace to you  and your family!
@metal discipline  thank you.  my prayers and condolences are with you and your family
@daniel gamache  many thanks friend  merry Christmas and happy new year to you and yours!
stop being so cute melonie  sheesh...Im just kidding btw  people are freaking crazy  glad you are safe  hopefully it doesnt escalate.
wait  youre 36  I thought you were like 27 and into retro geekery because an older sibling got you into it. my fiancee will kill me if I dont ask what are you using for skin care
he is delusional  she is actually my wife
Jesus youre my age  keep doing what youre doing. stay safe.
safety in numbers. a competent stalker will be able to ambush you no matter how well-armed you are.  hell  arming yourself without backup   free guns for him if he s not stupid
how sad is it he drove 15 hours to ask her out and then still couldnt do it in person  had to leave a card
dudes eyes tell the whole story.
this is creepy as hell  be safe mm
eeesh  stay safe!
wow thats crazy  you need ajw to defeat him with pure logic and physical strength.
who wouldn t want melonie as the future waifu. but this is not the way to do it lol
wow didnt know you  were getting married! congratulations! although seriously this is creepy.
this is the sweet anita situation all over again.
I ll be praying for you.
his internet name is frozen asian
how do you know that people you dont suspect aren t out to get you
yikes girl!!!! make sure you practice at least twice a month with that handgun  keep your skills up and you ll be safe
prayers for  you
this situation and her her approach to itshows why young women are safer not showing their faces online. ideally the men in her family should inform her the type of attention a young woman showing herself online brings and how to avoid or deal with it. let this be a lesson to the women who want to post similar content. like anything  it comes with risks.
this is one reason why I wouldn t be a youtuber or celebrity because of possible stalker problems  dont want stalkers
that was a joke!
is that you  frozen
literally me
this makes me not want to go to cons and meet these creators I like...
it always goes way differently in the anime shows
he probably has lampshades made out of other female youtubers in his living room!
rule  1- dont be this creepy dude. its not fuggin  cool bruh... he needs to leave this poor girl alone.
been there.be safe.carry at all times.
future ex wife
hiring professional security is probably not very cost effective  but you might want to get some of your male relatives involved to provide you with some protection. definitely should start carrying geo tags and link it to apps for your family so they know exactly where youre at all times in case something goes sideways.if your dad has the time  have him walk you everywhere. nobody on this planet is more willing to go as far as he needs to than your dad. for their daughters  they will kill the sun if thats what it takes. I d say not even most husbands or boyfriends would go the length a dad would for his baby girl.
wow! I pray for your protection. while dealing with the police I would advice that you up your personal security. if you  can get a personal firearm and training I  would advise it. and get some security cameras.
honestly outside of this whole thing being scary etc   this guy needs to get professional help not just for others safety but the own guys safety cause this is a ticking time bomb before something goes bad bad.
calling the popo...shit just got real!! be safe melonie
I had a stalker once. not a fun situation at all.
not saying its wrong to talk about this  but couldn t talking about him encourage him  I dont know so Im legitimately asking.
15 hours  sounds like a challenge deserving to be beaten
we need to have a conversation about toxic simping.
man  that instinct of yours not wanting to drive that night  that was someone watching over you
that why we should all keep a flame thrower with us at all times!!
now thats dedication.
careful mel  nothing you ve described here is illegal on his part.  but you putting his name and face with these accusations of stalking is until such a time that he does do something more substantial.  Im not saying you are wrong  I am saying if sean lawyer s up right now he can slap you with defamation or other such shit.  dont hate on me for pointing it out folks.drove 15 hours to see someone at a convention   legal  common  even normal.  people drive days to go see shows.  people follow acts like bands around the world.hitting on attractive women   legal  common  very normalleaving a card on a car with a compliment   mostly legal  not serious if it is an offense  like laws against handing out fliers in this town making youtube videos shooting his mouth off   again  legal af  commonthe future wife comments are not legally actionable beyond maybe establishing motive.  if you haven t got more than that   cops aren t going to be able to do shit.my 2 cent advice   restraining order  home security buffs if applicable.  stay strapped.  dont be shocked if yt hits you for putting his name face up here... they are shitty like that.
stories like this make me happy that Im not famous.
yeah that what Im thinking of  for the delusional type this is probably more encouraging than discouraging.
underrated comment.
melonie iam sincerely glad you are doing fine after these 2 ordeals looks like you have not skipped a beat! your awesome do not need another rebecca schaeffer suit-ration sincerely glad and should never come to thatseverity!
seems like a a lot of maybe what ifs and theories its simply a creepy fan glad u got ur subs up lol
I would suggest the springfield hellcat 9mm or the ruger lcp max 380.
it will help to learn martial arts  and to carry protection! stay safe!
damn. I guess that guy beat me to it... jk
I guess blocking someone would be enough to give a clue. at the same time though I feel like if you maybe had an actual conversation with him instead of blowing him off this might have been deescalated better. the guy just seems like he s in love with you and I totally get the perspective of  how do I  approach someone who doesnt even know I exist  Imean if this was a 36 year old super good looking guy  would you have given him more time  just saying itseems like you could have handled your initial interaction with him better. either way I hope everything works out.
wow  the phrase  melonir mac go boom  would take on a whole new meaning if she had to cap this dude.
be safe bud! very scary!
this is what parasocial relationships do to lonely men.on an unrelated note... hImel  Im your future husband. our love is real dont ignore me!
stay armed  stay safe.
I wish people didn t have to suffer with delusions
I love how you keep your hair!
be safe. dont forget to be armed.
wow  thats dedication.
just tell your stalker that your 36 and he ll leave you alone.
unfortunately  I dont know what the cops can do  unless this clown actually does something untoward. at least you ll see that yellow reflective jacket coming. two words - bear mace. a key ring siren might be good too. always keep your phone on. my wife is a visiting nurse and she goes out well equipped because she s run across weirdos from time to time.
you should have kept the gun info out of the video.  if he s been following you on twitter  he probably sees your videos here too.  stay safe.
this is why I try to avoid liking comments or replies on any social media - might be a little overly cautious but you never know when youre gonna cross paths with crazy.
stay hydrated and strapped!God bless.
stay safe alot of crazies out there.
I would call the police on anyone driving 15 hours to stalk me in a parking lot regardless of what they looked like
haha this part   my mods found it  aka simps aka huge potential to be future stalkers too. reality the cycle will never end. keep yourself protected at all times
bfd big freakin dog they are a hell of a deterrent and they aren t just all bark. its not a crime to defend yourself. make him pay for his crimes. stay safe and happy
this is a terrific example of why our society must stop glorifying and celebrating mental illness. shit can get real dangerous  real quick! stay safe melonie!
dont become a victim.  be proactive and protect yourself.
you are super freakin cute but 15 hours is a longggg way for someone who doesnt want you there! better get a firearm because we are all our own first responders. the crazies are out and all over. stay safe melonie!
he is lost and not aware that its over for him. only the black pill can help him to understand his situation.
thats really creepy when we get stalked
you have a guardian angel that day. be safe yo. what would croft do  dont do it. get restraining order instead.
sorry to hear this...stay safe
bet he s a ring of powers fan...stay safe mel
there s a reason I love 2a.
aahhh protect melonie at all cost!
good idea making this public. getting as many eyes on this as possible is itself an additional layer of protection.
you should interview him and find out his reasoning....find out why he thought thatalso the most amazing thing about this video is that melonie is 36
I suppose you could look at this as a perverse rite of passage. I guess this means you ve  made it . so  congratulations  seriously though  just stay safe!
carry a gun. but more importantly train with it. not just once a year and flat range. ultimately the police cant always be there when you need them. be safe! you matter!
God bless you and keep safe.
Jesus got you melanie  know that youre covered in his name and grace.
also maybe try checking ur car for tracking devices. search up someone who can search it. maybe there s no tracking device  but it doesnt hurt to look  better safe than sorry.
make insane asylums great again!
while it would be cool to meet you  doing something as insane as driving 700 ish miles unannounced would be insane to start with. then the presumption that you were obligated into entering into a relationship on top of it all wow.stay safe.
yikes.  might want to talk to your police about possibilities of getting swatted as well.  he s probably really disgruntled and might use swatting methods.
mel  if you dont carry  you should. springfield hellcat  keep it handy  keep it chambered.
melonie  I dont know much about you. I have no idea if you live in an area where you can carry a concealed handgun or not. nor should you declare whether you do or not. that being said  the world is full of lonely and desperate people who think their perception of reality takes precedence over your life and safety. do not live in fear  but also do not take your safety for granted. you were glad there were good men to assist you  but they wont always be there. you are your own first responder. take precautions and seek professional training. be your own version of lara croft
ugh  I hate creepy people. this guy clearly cant read the room. there are pretty girls Ive seen on social media that I would love to be in a relationship with. but Im just gonna wait for when God sends me the right woman. Im not gonna go out of my way to try and meet some girl who doesnt even know me just so I can live the fantasy of being with her. stay safe melonie.
oh no!  if your not armed  please do so immediately  melanie!  make sure to keep company in parking lots exe.
tell him you want commitment in his stocking. then he ll leave you alone. lmao!
wow this is nuts hope you pack heat wear you can.
eew then planned it and talked sht. sorry you had to go through that  melonie. thats creepy. I hope youre ok and just try to forget about this guy. anyways  happy holidays and  merry Christmas
I get that youre trying to spread awareness of the situation  but calling him  your stalker  is gonna make him think you have a special connection. now he s been acknowledged and on your channel  he s gonna keep chasing this high. Ive seen it happen to others. it would ve been better to keep it private and go to the authorities.
stalkers are very hard to stop due to the laws not contemplating it as a crime to pay for... unless something happens  but thats what happens after the stalking. all we can hope for is that one of your followers is a skilled professional  deleter   or a mobster or both  and he takes the matter into his own hands so the guy disappears before anything bad happens.at the very least someone not very friendly recognizes him and sends him to the hospital. whoever that person is  I d ask that he aims for the eyes. he wont be able to stalk anymore if he is blind.
well you are attractive  to stalk one has to really be driven.  hope you come out this ok.p.s. well hearing most this can say  thats a little frightening not sure what you should do.
in addition to carrying  go take some self defense courses  you aren t too tiny to do some pretty serious damage. if its not too late see if they have any security footage of his vehicle. maybe you can visitsome other youtube channels in texas  sorry dont know or care to know where you live  and shoot some targets  Im sharing this with my daughters  thanks for speaking out. try 30 super carry  its a lighter round than 9mm but has less recoil and almost identical ballistics  plus you get 2 or 3 rounds more in a mag. keep fighting for lara and tomb raider! good luck be safe.
just keep in mind people that most people are not born this way  this is something thatslowly develops into this warped sense of reality. pay attention to your mental health. I can garuntee that if you were to meet this guy some time ago he would be completely reasonable. get help if you need it and do not neglect your mental health. otherwise this can be you  this is obviously an extreme case but still. best defense is prevention.
you might want to contact the fbi. this is their jurisdiction and they have the resources.
go to the court house get a ccp  then to the sporting goods store  buy a small hand gun that you can conceal easily and take classes on how to handle and shoot until you have deadly accuracy  like laura croft  and dont leave home without it.  Im just starting this vid  but I am curious as to how in the hell he was able to find you in this great big country.
4 things - sorry you had to go thru this.- be very careful. carrying a weapon to defend is a good idea. carrying your keys protruding between your fingers can b used to defend - remember  even creeps have rights. dont give this guy anything where he can use the law against you.- guys - always make sure the girls  get into their house and door is closed  or into their car and car is started.
this was not what henry cavill meant  I think. a shame that male persistence has become so rare that only fringe neurotics in their forties find the nerve to  go for it .
Im sorry melmac let me drive 20 hours to comfort you.
if you dont carry a handgun you should probably start keep your self safe. there is lots of dangerous weirdos out there
take a firearms course and get your license who knows how many more of these incidents you will have and the police cant be there for you all the time  be careful melonie be safe.
be safe  please conceal carry if you can
dude u better carry some light sabers  plasma grenades  invisibility cloak!
be careful  what you put on the net stalkers can get your private information and sell it on the net.
you should probably consider hiring personal security. at least when youre out in the public.
he really likes you. its flattering
if I catch any person threatening my mum  sisters  daughters or wife... that person would beg to be in hell.. youre becoming famous so you will need some kind of protection  a bodyguard of some kind so you should look into it  stay safe.
meloine you missed a trick you should have asked him how much money does he earn if he s that keen to talk to you he has to buy you new shoes! he has to put his hand in his pocket! no really youre right not to joke about stalking its not nice when a random guy turns up and does this some people are going to do this given your looks and how youre confident and well known on social media just start an only fans and he can show his  love  by paying      for your attention...or just block them  and stay safe...
stay safe melonie
for stalkers watching you in person just builds up a hunger inside of them to want to touch and smell you. when that hunger becomes too much thats when the abduction happens. thousands of women go missing every year. keep your head on a swivel ladies!
definitely get the police involved. stay safe  I hate that you have to put up with this craziness.
please please be safe . hire a bodyguard.
hey kiddo please consider taking an old grandpa s advice  you need to have control over your own safety.  take self defense classes  in areas where cant carry a fire arm consider bear mace or wasp spray. a walking stick can also be useful. this dude is creepy to max. no one should have to live their life in fear. love your channel
the interwebs is such a weird-ass place. glad youre safe.
no weapon formed against you shall prosper. you have  the full  amor of God. fear not  for I am with you. says the Lord.  thank God meloknee ur ok
be safe  be smart  be alert when youre out and about. I dont know what state youre in  but research gun laws. find out if you have a castle doctrine or stand your ground laws. see if youre an open carry or constitutional carry state. save everything as evidence like youre building a case. in my security training for protecting dignitaries they always said to try to reverse engineer it. put yourself in their shoes and think about how you d go about getting to you in order to find your weak points.
I dont think this guy is your type melonie.
in my opinion  he s being demonically influenced. you being a Christian now and being very outspoken to people about Jesus  like we are called to do  is gonna put a big target on your back from lucifer. do not fear. the Lord is with you. it is good with your soul. keep fighting the good fight  and we can even pray that your stalker sees his wrongdoings and Christ saves him too
crazy ppl out there. more important than carrying a gun is knowing how to properly use the gun. make sure you are comfortable with shooting and utilize proper ammo and technique. if less than lethal force is needed get a flash light with high lux it can blind someone and give you a chance to run.
this is crazy
alil too cute for your own good.. accept some responsibility mel. besides  thatstache is majestic.
I am not a professional about this.  but the public has now been made aware of this guy.  I would strongly suggest that you dont interact with him further.  at all.  block every attempt to contact you and avoid talking about him in any way.  any acknowledgment of him is just going to feed his delusion further.  keep armed and keep safe.
there are tools that can greatly aid you in self defense. there is training to learn how to use them. make the time. luck is the result of preparation.
this is sad  stay safe.
Im not one for shouting people out but letting everyone know youre being stalked and who they are is smart. I dont care who you are. there s no reason to invade people s private spaces. people are crazy and I just dont understand a lot of them. what they do and how they think.
take itserious. conceal carry everytime you leave the house.
not to detract from the seriousness of the situation  but whoa  I legit thought she was something like 24. Im 38 myself  I wish I looked over 10 years younger. its probably my own fault for not using moisturizer
its one thing to be delusional  but those who cant take no for an answer are predators  and stalkers are cowards on top of it
I know a friend who has 5 stalkers who are in a cult. be careful
no idea who you are  but this video showed up on my feed.if you are legally able to  buy a gun and tell nobody. learn how to use it  make it your best friend. watch the active self protection channel  this will teach you to be alert and what to look out for.get an alarm system and a dog. both will potentially distract evil doers until you can fill them with slugs.get the biggest gun you can comfortably carry for when you are outside the home  get a smaller one for when you are home. always carry. if not a firearm  some type of pepper spray  preferably both. if you do carry  tell nobody.a woman that is armed is less likely to be a victim.
Jesus  mary and joseph. its a crazy world out there. stay safe    ken and brenda russell
damn stay safe  you shoul carry.
the trouble with getting the authorities involved is that they might claim his infatuation with you is just his sexual identity  and youre being a bigot for rejecting him.he needs a clear message that what he s doing is unacceptable.I suspect he already knows where you live  so I hope you have a strong man to be near you at all times.concerned for your safety.take care. stay safe.love your content  though not this one so much .
have your checked your vehicle for any apple airtags   just a thought.
take your safety into your own hands and get a concealed carry permit.
also to light up the mood  haven t you heard the spice girls  if you like a girl  you have to like her friends first
thats when you ve really made it.
the second amendment is your friend melonie  dont take any chances with people that are this crazy. take steps to arm and protect yourself in the worst case scenario.
if you ever see a note on your car or anything on your windshield do not get out of your car to check. drive to your destination first  then look. thats how creeps nab you. good luck! buy pepper spray!
creepy. seems like a chill guy... like some random youtuber vlogging in his living van. yet completly bonkers
also if youreally bug her she will say good bye  that par is very important
melanie  the Lord has his hand upon you. he says   the enemy would have you snuffed out  because you are a voice I have strategically placed into the frontlines of his  domain . but I have my hand upon your life  and I will protect you. dear child  I shall never leave you  nor forsake you. behold! I come quickly!  saith the Lord of hostsssss  Jesus Christ of nazareth.God bless.
hope youre ok
I will say this  in the least stalkerish way I possibly can. you look really good for 36  like I d have guess mid 20s. definitely not 36.not that I d drive 15 hours for it but... good work.note  the driving 15 hours bit was a joke for any snowflakes on here.
omg. be safe at all times. people can be nuts.
I hate people that wear work safety clothes as everyday outfits. lol
well if you do carry a gun I hope you are properly trained to use it. otherwise you may hurt yourself or someone else  or even have the other guy use it against you.
be safe. go boom.
this is sad. this fella needs therapy.  what ever relationships he had before needs to be sorted  out with professionals that cantalk him off the ledge he is treading on.this is society in general. a guy gets a little attention   it is so foreign to him he loses all logic about himself and his goals.  this is warning to other men  this is what happens when you lock yourself up.
this seems to happen a lot
at 36 melonie mac is hot as! sorry about the situation you have with the stalker. men like this give the rest of us a bad reputation. there must be literally thousands of men that adore you and have no delusions that their affection is anything more than a fantasy. this guy must realise that a small number of these men would gladly cause serious harm to a stalker of someone they like. I hope the guy wakes up to himself and is spared from any backlash he may have stirred up.
melonie you dont have to be conservative to be chivalrous. I consider myself a moderate when it comes to politics and would have done the same thing. just seems like an unnecessary thing to point out.stay safe!
stay safe!
sam hyde will protect you melonie. beware whomsoever puts him in a self defense situation.
ok  I thought you were 22....I need to start eatting butter. be well  mel.
from one Christian to another  may God and Jesus send the two toughest angels in heaven to be your shield.
I completely understand your reaction and where youre coming from  but did you also happen to message this guy at some point to tell him clearly that you are not interested and that you are blocking him because you no longer want his attention and find it off-putting   thatshould be a step taken prior to this blast.  I understand that he should have gotten the hint and realize this on his own  but people can become pretty impervious to such inferences if they ve really deluded themselves.
36     I would have guessed 26!  dont worry  Im not a stalker  lol
take this seriously. stalkers are absolutely deranged and wont leave you alone. if he knows where you live you need to get away.
sad that pretty young ladies have to deal with this. unfortunately this happens all the time.
please be wary of stalkers pretending to be cops. I wouldn t meet anyone claiming to be a cop  in person  without them proving they are an leo.
youre 36...  I genuinely thought I was watching someone in their early 20s when Ive come across your content from time to time. but thinking about it now  your whole tomb raider background does fit a person of said age. I dont feel as old now cos Im actually a few years younger than you xd anyways keep up the neat content melonie and sorry to hear about your stalker problem  hope you manage to resolve it!
maybe this video will wake him up to his insane behavior.
at the risk of sounding like a creepy stalker dont you live in texas  if you dont have firearms its an incredibly fun and empowering hobby to get into. I got my ltc this year and its a tremendous responsibility and I love it. I strongly recommend everyone  but especially single women  strap up and learn the laws.
not entirely sure I d drive 15 hours to see my actual wife. maybe there s something there for ya  lol.
hopefully  the cops sat him down and explained to him that old men need to put aside such foolishness and age gracefully. or else spend their golden years in jail. glad youre ok.
I want to preface with  I truly do enjoy your content and appreciate your talent. however  Im curious  if he was 20 years younger and a natural 10 with some money. would he still be  drove 15 hours to stalk me.  or...  king drove 15 hours to shoot his shot.  its an interesting thought problem. anyway  keep carrying your handgun. go boom.
just marry the  dude already
protecting women is something every man should do  not for reward or admiration  instinctively from a place of moral masculinity
my twitter notifications had 33 alerts of this stalker just getting dragged and dog piled lmao
and compared to this video right here as far as she goes dudes dont even bother talking to her dont even approaching her asking for a date cuz she s going to claim your stalker and this is the way she s going to act because he left her a letter and he tried approaching her he was a little nervous it happens doesnt make him a stalker unless he followed her at home when she never did or unless he follow her to the hotel but she never did then this would never hope in court on the reverse he cantake her to court and sue her for false claims and she can go to jail for this s    she s accusing him of a crime he didn t commitso what he said some sexual things about her on the internet so what he changed his account 15 times according to the social justice warrior the infuso its not stalking its on the internet people can follow you all the time the only time its really considered stalking if somebody follows you from work somebody follows you at home or somebody falls into a hotel room or follows you to a restaurant she has no proof at all of that he never follows her to a restaurant he never followed her to the hotel you never followed her home its hearsay judge judy 101 and she wonders why she ll never get a boyfriend because this video right here no man will ever approach her because he s afraid he ll get oh he s talked to me and she ll call the cops and tried to convince the next guy all these two but he was trying to stalk her give me a break he should go to court and sue her for false claims unless you have evidence of somebody stalking you you have video and pictures of somebody following you around to a restaurant to a hotel to your home or your work you dont have anything this would never open court he can get a lawyer he can sue her and then she can do jail time for false claims
its nice to see receipts of actual harassment.  you should probably tag in all the feminists that constantly claim harassment  and yet never show any of it.
thats pretty wild. be safe.
let it be your lesson that this is what happens when you eat too much butter.
honestly  I d tell that dude to run and never look back
get a conceal carry if you dont already have one. people are out of their flipping minds.
itsaddens me this happened to you and that ladies like yourself have this kind of threat looming. being trapped in a delusion is terrifying to think about. I am tempted to come out of retirement.
stay safe !
I just cant believe he would do that to the climate!!!
be very safe.
you honestly cant get that mad about this  its part of the game you play. if you work as a personality who puts themself out to the public then everybody can see you. there are crazy lunatics out there  itsucks but unless they do anything then you cant do anything. just buy a gun and accept that you are choosing this lifestyle. its easy living with good money
if he were younger  a 10 10  and had a good career I d find it creepy that he d drive 15 hours to camp out in a parking lot instead of just sliding in my dm requests. the 15 hour drive and camping a parking lot thing is creepy behavior regardless of who does it.
stay safe. remember that yeshua has angels of protection around you.
wow thats crazy this guy needs to be dealt with severely
15 hours isn t bad! there are women whose stalkers only travel like forty minutes! just be glad you have a dedicated stalker and not some half rate poser!
I wonder how many more wives he stopped to say hI to on that 15 hour drive lol
stalkers male or female you should watch out for  fans are great but some are obsessive in a creepy reverse flash kind of way.
make sure you practice thatsecond amendment right of yours melanie. stay safe and keep well
stay safe! what a creep loo
in your past videos you talk about you wanting to have a man in your life you know somebody who plays games you dont want other things together you never going to get that if you dont allow them into approach you you know if a guy walks I can ask you to out for a walk in the park or starbucks date thats not stocking he was just approaching you being shivers as you call it you know let him approach you you know or hell approach him thats the only way youre never going to be single if you basically dont want to be single you going to have to give in
I have grown with my having had stalked people online in the past to having had just cut myself off from people. until recently have started interacting with people again.
arm and protect yourself.  police cant really do much until a crime has occurred.  a restraining order or protective order doesnt stop a crazy person and even if they violate it they wont be in jail long  if at all .
you ve clearly expressed your feelings and concerns. my advice is to not speak again publicly about this matter. contact your attorney and work with police and the courts.
so sad to hear this
seems like a bice guy im sure you both will have a wonderful life together congrats
how crazy would it be if yal ended up married though
does he like bear mace   is he an icehead who likes getting blasted with bear mace    you need the dog. the big bad dog.   joke aside  seriously. be careful. if you dont have a ring camera then I d advise investing in one. our family has one and its incredible. you can watch the cam feed live  and if anyone shows up to the door  you cantell them the cops are on the way via speaker. ring is expensive  but probably worth it. especially in this situation.
I am truly and earnestly glad that you are okay and  beyond disgusted that you had to endure this in the first place  but I have to say it is tragic how many people s solution is buy a gun. how about move somewhere that has less guns than people  no matter how justified  when you take another s life... thatstains your soul forever. please  please be safe melonie. but  and I say this as a very lapsed catholic and with as little irony as humanly possible  for the love of God  find a way to find safety that doesnt require a lethal weapon.
imagine  I dont need no man!
melonie  go give yourself a break from the internet if you need it. your safety and mental health is the priority.
be armed and be vigilant
it is a sad thing to say  but get yourself a firearm and training. if you dont already have one. as the expression goes  better to have one and not need it  then need it and not have one.
get a ppo  personal protective order  aka a restraining order  from the police first. if you dont already own carry a firearm  own carry one you are comfortable with and train with it  keep it ready to go  train with it  I cant stress training with it enough  train with it  if you have a buddy willing to cause some level of stress for you to train with  do it  you ll be better off. when you are scared  your training will kick in  and you ll do things automatically. thats the best way I can describe it. and get a ppo.read up on the laws in your area involving self-defense and conceal carry. and usually having a ppo already  will go a long way in establishing conditions for self-defense  in the eye s of the law. at least in my state. get a ppo.if you dont already have a big dog  get one. preferably one trained. german shephards from everything Ive seen  are a good breed  but there are many good breeds. there are many old police dogs that need a home  because they are retiring for whatever reason  and they are updated on their shots and vet visits  and while youre there get a ppo. they ll notice something before you do. keep a back up  like a knife or something  in case you cant get to the firearm for whatever reason. and when you finally have to defend yourself  you are trying to kill the assailant  not disarm  not maim  not scare  kill. if you aren t prepared to dish out that level of violence  then you ll be the dead one. get a ppo.stay alert for any and all exits  and any and all threats  in any place you enter  always have a way to escape  plan it  and know what you ll do when the time comes to act. training and planning is as important as the act of defending yourself. while getting a ppo at the police station  they can probably answer many questions you have about training and planning for the worse case scenario  so get a ppo.
I will say this melanie. get a big dog like a rottweiler or a pit bull and take the dog every where with you
hope you are safe and get yourself a firearm. all bullets are faster than dialing 911
brah on a way more serious subject matter  are you wearing a freagn strawberry shortcake sweatshirt ! ! rofl 80s kid all day    me too
please be safe out there. I used to work in a max security prison and was a deputy prior to getting into aerospace. I have almost a decade of experience dealing with mental health case loads  sexual predators and murderers. people who get obsessed and delusional like that can be extremely dangerous. notify the police and place a restraining order. make sure you dont put yourself in a gullible position. meaning dont go outside alone without telling your loved ones your whereabouts. predators are opportunistic  keep that in mind. he seems to be pretty unhinged. Im sorry that youre dealing with someone like that. its good to let people around you know that he is a legit threat. hopefully he will get the hint and go away. keep all documentation of this situation. just in case you need it. make sure that you have your concealed carry at all times. if youre driving towards your home  take a look around to try to make sure youre not being followed. if you feel like youre being followed  keep driving until youreach a public location and call the police. I know its stressful and scary. but keep your head up! much love and hugs to you! again  stay safe!
hate to feed into paranoia  it isn t that difficult to disable a car so it breaks down after a few miles. it may be inconvenient  but when going to an advertised place  you may want to have a friend follow you to your hotel and see that youreach the lobby.
pretty sure you can outrun vito
that really suck sorry   always carry your gun on you dont ever think I ll be fine one time without it because that one time you might need it.keep us posted
do not be afraid  do not be discouraged  for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. joshua 1 9
melanie  I am a former cop and my biggest advice to you is have your own protection. thats number 1 and no  I dont mean pepper spray either. a restraining order is all fine and well  but its just a piece of paper and it does nothing to anyone who s truly disturbed  or really wants to do harm. second thing.. report. but that negates what I just said.. yes and no. if its not in a report  it didn t happen. anytime this guy makes a video  sends a message  anything  report it. a paper trail will help you if this ends up in court. but.. back to my first tip.. thats the most important one because cops are overworked  underpaid  and they may not make it to you as quickly as they need to. praying for you and I hope this is resolved soon.
guinness world record of time traveled for a  no.
19 00  he drove 15 hours 19 20  he drove 15 miles what a drive that must have been.youre right  this guy sounds pretty insufferable.
does this mean you have officially made it
get a concealed weapons permit and dont feel bad if you have to drop a delusional stalker. if you feel threatened shoot first ask them questions later
this guy is nuts  melanie is going to be my future wife!!!  but seriously I was worried and concerned after you made that video exposing how the left and this wokism stuff is from satan. now there may not be a correlation with this guy and that video but I personally dont believe in coincidences  unless this guy was harassing you before that video. regardless  dont just  be careful   whatever that effin means  get a gun and go to classes and learn how to use it. or go to the classes first and then buy something after you try a few rentals.
be safe!
damn.  in the clip you played was he calling himself both  dunk  and  shawn or sean .. like schizo mpd style   and that  dunk  was saying if it was important to  shawn or sean  that he should go follow his dreams or whatever   if so  that is totally wack.  glad you got a gun and I hope it all simmers down by itself... or maybe when  dunk  offers his opinion to  shawn or sean  that maybe it just  wasn t meant to be .
oh  thats what tony of the geek getaway looks like
if you dont want to carry a pew pew  you should carry a byrna. cheap  non lethal and can absolutely stop a grown man flat from 30-40ft away.
holy crap  thanks for dropping the comment. didn t even know they made freaking pepper rounds. mission 4 would be fun lol.
so youre looking pretty emotional as you say  what could have happened .  while youre right that any thing could happen  when youre looking back dont let your imagination run you into a state of fear or dread over this guy attacking you.  fact is that he left a note on your car  which indicates he gave up on seeing you in person and left the area.  so even if you did walk out there alone  he wasn t waiting for you.  Im not negating that mindset or telling people to be careless  bu its easy to look back and start to feel dread or let your imagination run away with you about being harmed  wondering someone was in the bushes or around the corner just waiting to pounce.  all indicators are that he was gone and had you been alone  he wasn t around to harm you.btw  I haven t been watching you for very long but you have a solid head on your shoulders.  the curse of looking the way you do is that people are going to lust after you.  if you dont already  get yourself a gun  learn to use it   and put a few hundred rounds a month through it at the range.  also  I always tell my lady friends to get themself enrolled in and weekly practice at least 1 stand up and 1 ground martial art.   muay thaI and some form of grappling are a good combination .
damn I wouldn t drive 15 hours for anyone
so basically since the guy basically drove 15 mI to come meet you basically ask you on a date but basically let s just in less than a sweet little card for you he s a stalker really maybe he was just nervous because he didn t know how to talk to you cuz you were really busy some friends basically all he basically is is basically you can give you a comment basically he said well I dont really know each other but maybe if you wouldn t mind getting them we can meet up somewhere and get to know each other like a starbucks date would you like to go on a starbucks date just give you the number basically the number to text you back and all that too but just because a guy basically drives 15 miles to meet you 15 hours to meet you whatever it is and because he wasting the park onto this week to talk to you basically doesnt make him a stalker
this guy definitely has low standards if he s stalking you. Imean he should atleast stalk a hot chick
I took my video down I dont want nor need any prosperity from it..regardless of the support Ive received from unbiased viewers..also for the record..Ive never donated any money to miss mac ..I have always held that it was improper I was only in it to get to know her an  all I did was basically say  nice to meet you in the most cordial of manners after running into her in a parking lot at a public event .if she isn t willing to work on more than that than its fruitless effort 15 hrs most gals would be flattered sorry you took it the wrong way but I wish you peace love and understanding..the challenge here is to be a better person not the bigger influencer
while there are very few people like this in the world  they do still exist  as you no doubt understand now. as a  public figure  you need to assume this kind of thing can happen. aka move through the world in a way that limits the ability of people like this from getting in your space. its a sad reality  but a reality none the less. there are many benefits you enjoy from being in the public eye. sadly this is one of the downsides you need to be prepared for as best you can. welcome to the club of woman famous enough to enjoy the  crazies . now do what s smart to protect yourself.
the look on your face watching that guy s video lol
I also feel it necessary to apologize to the blonde haired girl it was not my intention to allude an attraction by saying  checking me out  only a familiarity I say this because some of my other interactions with the panelists that day seem to suggest that they might be familiar with my content  ie my bear gryllis spoof ..I was aware that the blonde haired girl was with another panelist
damn cant have anything nice these days with all these stalker ruining it by stalking youtube creators we like
just keep gathering evidence and share them with police as soon as you get them to have them keep a record of what s been happening. everything new that pops up too as it will show how long its been happening.even with a restraining order these crazys dont change.so that way when your force to defend yourself when your life is in danger  and you end up shooting the nut case your protected.so besides all the police stuff  either a private armed guard or gun safety classes for a concealed weapon permit and .25 cal small firearm the size of your hand and  fits in your pocket. dont depend on cops to save you. they never will.you gotta do it yourself  the moment your life is in danger. I always carry a concealed knife as well that comes out with a flick of my wrist. that way if someone grabs you  you can still stab them.never leave them alive they just come back for more.
reading  some  of the 2500  comments itseems you have a following of  hero  men ready to catch you before you fall. if your  fans  catch this individual it is hoped they do not act as vigilantes on your behalf  you could be held liable for injuries put upon him. best let law enforcement deal with him  right his behavior goes to show how easy it is for unstable persons to be triggered by their own desires...you enabled him somehow. if you got a chance to ask  why   I recommend it  even if from him behind bars. if anything  confront him to get answers everyone can benefit from.I do not know why this  popped up  on my yt feed  but I will not sub as you are tied to jeremy from the quartering and he is a creep from hell.  I expect comment censoring yt.
sounds like you pulled a mersh trying to arrest the internet lol
I hope youre okay... its sad and pathetic. stalkers are absolutely deranged  and need to be institutionalized  plain and simple. Imean melonie is stunning  if I was single I d love to have a shot  but its delusional to actually stalk a woman. I d try to rationalize it  but even attempting to do so is completely futile  not to mention impossible. you cant try to understand someone who is completely deranged  or delusional because logic and reason aren t a part of their rationale  or what little rational thought you d even associate with reason. a sane guy would shoot his shot  hI  can I buy you a drink  maybe get a bite for lunch  which Im sure would get a  no thanks  or whatever brush off  then you go on with your life. insane is thinking your destined to be married because you saw a girl on a video on the internet. thats the thing though  this is insanity. this is where we re at now as a society. we used to institutionalize people like this  people who effectively live in an alternate reality. people who think they talk to dogs  or think any variety of just absolutely off the wall things that just aren t real. I actually feel as bad for this guy  as I do for melonie. typically my first reaction would be to kick the shit out of this guy for what he did  but the thing is  he s sick  he has an illness. for a guy like me to wreck this guy would be like demolishing a guy with ms. its just wrong. I dont blame this guy as much as I blame society in general. we need mental asylums  we need places that people like this guy can be sent to get serious psychological help. pretending that people with mental illness are normal  or should be leading a normal life is actually dangerous. imagine if this guy s delusion had actually been going on for years  that he actually believed that he and melonie had actually gotten married  and she was cheating on him  and he was determined to hurt her or something. and melonie  if you actually do see this. dont worry  chivalry isn t dead  Im sure at any given show  or appearance  or whatever it is you do in person  there are more men than you can count who will do whatever they canto keep you safe simply because its the right thing to do. that doesnt just apply to melonie  but to women in general. at least thats how me and pretty much all of my friends are.
stay safe. this is why its 2a every day.
ahhh come on  you d make a great mrs creepy. you guys could get matching messed up cowboy hats
Im so sorry for you Im so sorry for you itseems like youre living in a nightmare a shirt I did nothing to me I think youre absolutely lovely and beautiful however youre a catholic like me and I really like him respect your channel and I really like what you stand for and I really admire you I am a big fan of yours but I also respect you but thats why I can come out and say that having a love or admiration for somebody is good but you always have to keep your distance and always have to keep a certain amount of distance and especially the good amount of respect the healthy amount of it actually now even though I think you are lovely very beautiful and quite frankly amazing even though I find you very beautiful and amazing I still hold very high amount of respect for you guys like him really need to know their boundaries actually a lot of people need to know their boundaries anyways regardless if you like my twitter. Im just happy to comment on your video keep making your videos and keep doing a great job and God bless you
dudes gotta silence of the lambs kinda vibe to him
I said this on your twitter but I would like to repeat it again here. I believe women should protect themselves by any means necessary so I do feel once again this is my personal pain. you should be licensed to carry a firearm for yourself or self protection or a really big ass attack dog. if you do so  please name the attack dog bakugo.
have you checked for trackers   need to
thats why you should pack heat. hollow point rounds. dont worry about going to jail for self defense youre a young attractive white women. you could win the trial with a public defender if it ever goes to trial.
oh he s a stalker. Im one of her mods. I know the entire situation. he cyber stalks her  she blocked at least 20 of his accounts and he keeps making more to communicate with her   he knew she was going to be at debate con so he camped in the parking lot in his truck long before she showed up and then waited at the vehicle he believed to be her s. he traveled 15 hrs just to try and ask her out because he believes she is his future wife  even though he doesnt know her the tiniest bit . that is creepy and stalking and this is just the tip of the iceberg. if you still cant see that then you have a problem. he is a stalker  creep and psycho who knows her vehicle and license plates  that is scary stuff.
@xtremenerdpat  do your full of it its not stalking unless he follows her at home or he falls her to the hotel room he didn t know such thing I could take this to court and I can have her sued and get her put in jail for false claims bro
@xtremenerdpat  there s no such thing as cyber stalking if that was the case the infuser would be in jail a long time ago and he s a bigger youtuber than her the only way she would ever be able to get to ever do this she d have to have video evidence of him following her around from her from her home or the con is she have video evan to him following her from the con to her house or to the hotel or to the restaurant that I can see it but she doesnt have either one thats hearsay and she can be sued for false claims another words it false claims if somebody is so super false claims they re accusing somebody without any evidence you can lose money and you can do jail time do you know how many people I have seen that happen to I have one friend of mine who was accused of beating up his mom without any evidence buy some 16 year old brat so what did he do he got a lawyer took it to court now the 16 year olds in jail for false claims her parents had to pay up a thousand dollar fine
@byron smotherman  not full of it. its literally stalking. no you wouldn t be able to. the police are on her side  because unlike you  I know the situation and I know what stalking is.

Im going to take a different approach to this. first yes the guy may be delusional...but here where is society fails. if you scroll these comments you see nothing but contempt for him. I get it women are at risk  and I am glad she is ok and has people around her protecting her. that being said  when you ostricize this guy who unless Imissed something...didn t assault her  granted the creating accounts over and over is a big issue....this guy needs help. if we go the Christian route of things  what  would Jesus say  I am not saying melanie did anything wrong here. this man does need help  prayer  and compassion. no one knows what could make him think this behavior is ok. he needs support  therapy for sure. stalking is pointless from any logic....I cant think of any healthy relationship thatstarted from stalking. it is flawed logic. shooting your shot  no problem...but if it misses you got to shoot on another court. I hope this man finds some help and love and encouragement and stops terrorizing melanie or anyone else online. he wont find happiness there.
be careful melonie
not sure what your home state is  but get yourself some training and get yourself a concealed weapon for self defense.  pistol if possible.  delusional people sometimes resort to attacking or kidnapping the focus of their delusion  and its better to have it and not need it  than need it an not have it.  you are your own first responder.
I would love to have a stalker
get a restraining order  the evidence you have is more than plenty for any judge. let the police handle it from there.
as I tell all the women in my life  the firearm is the great equalizer. there s just to many stories of women not able to protect themselves and becoming victims. sadly  women tend to be overwhelmingly anti-gun. its so self defeating.
unfortunate that people behave this way.
while Im not supporting stalking. you know if this dude looked like henry cavill  and not hillbilly ed people would find this romantic. hell  there are movies where if you changed how attractive the guy is it would turn into a horror movie.
next time you announce going to a  upcoming  event have chris hanson be your chauffeur but it is a serious  matter hopefully  my daughter  wont have to deal with thus but Im certain it happens to alot of women
I didn t know who this young lady was until jeremy  the quartering  reported on it. there are at least 10 000 ex- praetorians in texas  now  landed gentry.  you have a duty to the state to resolve this.......
apply for concealed carry courses asap! learn to defend yourself as a woman through firearm training  because remember  a restraining order is just a piece of paper.
please please please stay safe.
the great thing about texas is they are very pro 2nd amendment.
you ever asked yourself  why cant my stalker be jason momoa
to anyone who believes they have recieved a vision or a word  especially concerning a possible future spouse  do yourself a favour and ask God to confirm it to you  it will save you alot of heartbreak and disappointment. remember what joseph said to pharaoh   paraphrasing   God has doubled the dream to you because the matter is firmly established by God  and God is showing pharaoh what he is about to do. also  if you have to drive halfway across the country to meet a woman who doesnt even know your name  that might be a sign thatshe isn t your wife.
Im concerned. I like your videos and want to continue to grow old and crochety watching them. I think you need to seriously consider some private armed security. cops are great but they re minutes away when seconds count. dudes like this guy spiral and get more and more unhinged as time goes on. seriously  protect yourself. I dont want to wake up to you being on a new episode of coffeehouse crime.
lmao I like how half of the comments dont acknowledge its a man.  oh yeah Im sorry youre going through this  people are weird.  saids the guy who is also probably stalking her.
so this is a real bad situation and I am sorry you have to deal with this. but its not really fair to be an ageist and say things like  omg he s old  60 something and no way anyone would want thatsome of my friends that are in their 20 s date women  on their way to 40  and women in their 20s say the same kind of wrong stuff that you said here. I understand this guys doing wrong. but attacking his age like thats a factor of why he s doing this isn t right. highschool move.I do hope you are safe and ok. mental issues happen with all ages.
this man took parasocial relationship to another level  that level is delusion. this is not how you ask out a woman anyway  from the get go he announced to the world that the girl is his future wife  made it creepy. man s thirsty and hasn t had a real conversation with a woman for years atleast.
chivalry has little to nothing to do with conservatism.  tbh Ive found that most honorable people with integrity dont affiliate with a strict political ideology since both have been corrupted.  thatstalker dude was crazy and I dont condone his actions but to say that conservative men are known for their honor and integrity is laughable.
no  I would never find a stranger camping in a parking lot waiting for me to be romantic regardless of what he looked like. that will always be creepy. not to mention a guy who was attractive and had his life together wouldn t have to resort to something insane like that anyway
@melonie mac go boom  Im saying how disgusting our society has gotten. where there is a double standard. there are people that would not understand how this is an issue if he looked a certain way. not implying you are one of those people. some movies even promote this behavior.
because then it wouldn t be a stalker. what determines creepiness is how attractive the men are. her entire audience are almost exclusively these exact sad  desperate  lonely men. she d be nothing without the attention they provide. thats why I dont feel sorry for her.
@surreal resonance  you must be confusing mac s audience she courts with those of amouranth s or pokimane fanbase  hahaha!  she s not your typical e-girl streamer that milks off her looks and work the para-social relationship angle.  to say she s  nothing  without thatsort of fanbase is obvious you haven t watched or comprehend her content.
so odd when people stalk 5s. thats when you know he may be crazy.
he looks like a demon assigned to stop you.
ok  first off  if at any point you felt unsafe I sincerely think thats not right and everyone should feel comfortable enough to just walk to their car at night. I do wonder if you have any reason to believe if the person was or would become violent. being annoying on twitter is not evidence of possible violent behavior. does this person qualify as a stalker  sure. is melanie over reacting a little  I know many here will not like me saying this but yes  she is a little. if you are going to be a public figure you have to expect this to a certain point. Imean tim pool has claimed to have been swatted over 10 times now with no sign of itstopping along with people breaking into his property. I also wonder how high of an opinion one must have of themselves to not even be a little flattered a person drove 15 hours just to take a chance with you. while I agree its creepy it also means that person really likes something about you. maybe you get so many positive remarks that you think you deserve them but I dont understand that. all you can do is set clear boundaries and hope you can afford security. I will say hearing attractive women say things like this makes it easier to understand why there is a thing known as mgtow.  melanie youre a cute and peppy girl with loads of energy and a really likable personality. I guess before I say anymore I should assure you Im happily married with a child so I am in no way  flirting  with you. that being said you give really good game reviews and just add decent content to popular culture. Im not sure if exposing this person was a justifiable action. if you have any other evidence that this man did mean to harm you in some way making this video was a great idea and I hope you also called your local leo.
maybe he thought you would fall for that hat. yikes
you need to hire a bodyguard seriously. this guy is a loony tune. get a restraining order  and provide police with all evidence as soon as its posted. normally  having the police help you before an attack happens does nothing. you have to wait to be attacked or worse to get their involvement. get a bodycam  too  just in case you dont have any security with you. I d buy a gun and take some lessons at your local shooting range. get a concealed carry permit and keep that thing with you and ready to pop when you pull it out of the holster. also  take a few self-defense classes. your survival is imperative because you cant always have security or a gun available all the time. this comes down to you not being a victim and being ready to defend yourself until this nutcase is gone or stops. chances are though that creeps like this dont stop on their own. take care  sweet melonie.
so I guess that means my chances are slim but not zreo
just started following you on twitter.
better get some personal protective gear like mace and a pistol or something.
where do guys have the time for this stuff
stay safe
who s that guy that was hiding behind you in the video
sorry shawn  I guess you ll just have to settle for your hand.
I cant believe youre 36 ! I thought you were like 24
this is why you need an onlyfans account.
we got your back  lady.
just remember a restraining order is just a piece of paper. Im glad youre armed.
how creepy! this guy is like  in his forties or something!  stay safe melanie!
I like the topic and feel it comes with the job    if I have time this weekend I will look at some of your other content . I see you got a omment from theqaurtering I like that guys channel you should hook up with him sometime and do some topic like a woman stalker story    im sure there is one out there
I ain t gonna lie  I thought she was in her low to kid 20s lol
please be safe
the guy looks old enough to be your grand dad....lol
do we get an update on this
got pepperspray  good time to invest in one at times like these..
might not be the best idea playing his videos on your channel he probably thinks thats you saying yes to marriage lol
8 11 - 8 20so  it was that kind of convention.
scary af  please consider getting your concealed carry license if you haven t already...oops I should ve waited til the end lol  good news
be safe.
check your car for one of those air tags...
thats dedication
there was some weirdo that was arguing with me here in the comments from another vid the other day. I asked him why is he even here when he said he doesnt even watch the videos and he started saying some weird shit about how he s here to bring her down and mentioning her age and her divorce I wonder if this was him lol
thats scary. guess thats why tho failing I push to be an animator. rather my work gets notice than my actual face. people are creepy
following you on twitter  now on here.
what an assholehe was creepy hope he left you aloneregards and a hug melanie great content and profesional as always
genuinely thought you were in your 20s
also  train with that gun regularly.
still  in this day and age  sheesh  wishing you all da best.
geeeeeee he is a banana short of a bunch stay safe and have a awsome 2023 from new zealand. looking forward to your content esp on tomb raider my they not stuff up the new games  but please dont knock old people just say this person is a creap otherwise people will think all old people are like that and of cause they are not.
2 days later....please  please  please  please becareful!!!!!!if you know anyone  or anyone who knows people who works on a news station that person people may help you find this guy. in hope you have your family and friends around you.just remember to carry your gun licence  and of course  your gun.have fun doing what you do  and take care ....
so do we have the full video somewhere
if I was in this case  I d bait this guy into doing something more evidently open that could lead to a felony arrest. that video alone could just get him a verbal warning from the police and possibly just put into their watchlist. later this guy could still carry out his nefarious plan if he has one.
this is scary stuff.
yeah but if youreally if he was really sensitive basically he would probably would basically put his name for that first and last name and basically and asked if you want to go on a starbucks date or walk in the park and then leave your number or at least try to approach you in person but maybe he was just nervous you know
thats crazy melonie ! that manic better not come near my future wife !
youre 36 ! ! ! ! ! I would ve said you were like 23 at most lmfao. wow  thats a shock
36  holy shit I would have guessed 24 haha. good for you  Im 34 so not saying 36 is bad!
schizophrenia can be a problem.
yepp psycko! be safe!
and who says romance is dead.
you do have a nice smile! but yeah  probably wouldn t drive 15 hours to tell you that....
..moments like that make me apreciating your u.s. gunlaws ... we in germany arent really allowed to be armed ..well with guns at least   stay safe  be careful  maybe learn some krav-maga or a lil muay-thay!! peace and go boom
lmao these dudes rly gotta get a hobby my mans almost in a retirement home
so  what you mean to say is  you have options! lol I am kidding. that dude is a trucker  because that looks like he is filming from the sleeper in the cab.
that dude is innocent
thats how you know you made it
thats awful Im sorry you have to go through something like that
be safe
youre 36 ! based on the fact that you look 25 now  youre going to be getting stalkers into your early 50s. joking aside  glad you had some chads to help you out and got home safe.
someone get this to redbar.
here s clearly smoking a will smith pack in that van!!
oh jeez.. how did he find you  o
what s worse  the stalker or his twitter comment in the video at 0 40.... x_x
the way you pronounce arielle s last name is scar-cell-a
damn thatsucks! what s wrong with people! !
be safe! carry a pistol if the law allows where you are.
lol. I remember I watched you a million years ago
thats how my great grandma and my great grandaddy met! mel that most likely how your great grand parents met also  hahahah.. seems like he does need help
aww.........unrequited love.........poor guy!- sorry  when it goes that far  its not even funny. somebody better keep him in check.
there s these wonderful pills that help cure this kind of problem   hydro-shok rounds come in .45 acp  .40  and 9mm dosages  if you catch my drift.
internet is full of crazy people. they think they know the real person on the camera. or they make up stuff in there minds.
get the strap. -50 centmelonie mack might have to go boom for real this time
aint gonna fault the man for shootin his shot. lol
happy youre fine. crazy shit.
hopefully the police can help!!otherwise please stay save till is is cleared all out
if this is handy at all  looks like his video is inside of a big rig
tell me you have some big brothers uncles close please!
damn girl  I dont even follow you on twitter anymore since I got banned. why you gotta call me out like this
that dude has some serious crazy eyes... Im sure its just the lighting but they almost look like a demonic yellow.
yikes be careful   need a bodyguard  lol
maybe the guy was just nervous around you maybe he did want to ask you out you know
fr melonie u gotta do a livestream
the name of this video sounds like a horror movie
who tf does this guy think he is   Im your future husband
wow she does not look 36! oh and that really sucks she has a stalker
I hope you have a concealed carry permit.
making a 20 minute video about someone with an unhealthy fixation on you is the worst  most dangerous thing you can do in this situation. she s acting like someone 20 years younger than she is.
get your pistol permit. wear it proud.
never throw away the cards keep then for the cops.
if you dont have security get some. even if it costs abit of money.better safe than sorry.
always carry a pew pew for self defense..... that is my advice. stay strapped  its the great equalizer.
what     youre 36    I thought youre like 22 or something!!!
wtfudge   be safe. prayers.
this is making me way too uncomfortable wayy too early.
wow she is 36  thought she was 23 max
that is so creepy.
omg he looks like rutger hauer in the old movie hitcher except he has facial hair  great movie watch it!
man that guy looks super familiar. does he make youtube videos  Im not on any social media  just youtube
heard your name before  never seen you before  36! not bad  I honestly would have said mid twentys
Imean Im not driving 15 hours  but your awesome as sh   you could be my future ex-wife if you would like. keep your personal info as guarded as you can. plenty of ill  and evil people in the world...be safe.
hope you have a ccl .... and use it.
bunch of messed up creeps in this world. be safe because you never know.
take care of yourself. this is unacceptable behavior. Im going to add if you see this guy again  dont confront him at all. go immediately to the police.
its a crazy unhinged world be careful
im mean im a simp for you but I certainly wouldnt do something like that. grab a sig  a cc license  and walk tall. God bless and stay safe.
eyes are evil  by that you cantell he is up to no good.
that man has eyes of a vampire lmao wtf or like geralt lmao
dude looks coming straight from resident evil 7.
geez. some people just cant take a hint. not even if it came out the barrel of a gun.
I said youre my future ex wife!! am I a stalker  lol be safe girl
never heard of you. yr vid was just in the suggestions.  no matter what sadly their are always wacko s on this earth that get strange ideas.
stalk the stalker lol
e-celeb meet n greet  cringe congrats on the sub increase lol
very sad situation. the price of fame is this parasocial relationships that  fans  form with  their  celebrities. and it is damaging on both sides  the  celebrities  get scared and might get harmed and the  fans  feel worthless and looser  which they actually are   since being a fan of another human is stupid behavior . and there is no solution.  celebrities  have to look good desirable  and pretend to be friendly to connect with fans and get money and attention  and looser have to spend the little money they have on  celebrities  in order to feel someone cares about them and make celebrities live a nice cushy life. sad world and it is only going to get worse as more and more people lack a real social life and instead have a play-pretend social life on the internet. if thatstalker had real friends in real life he would have not done those stuff because he would have been feeling ashamed of himself  you cant feel ashamed when  no one cares about you.
your being stalked by michael gross from tremors
youre 36   God blessed you with great genetics.
I honestly thought you were in your mid 20 s
stalkers future wife drama
he left you a note on your car you probably just want to ask you out on a date so he was in the parking lot so what he waited for you thats not stalking basically the only time if he s really stalking you is when he s following you to your house youre so full of it you know I feel sorry for him going after melody back cuz she s 36 years old youre calling him old really youre 36 a lot of guys his age would go out to girls 25 to 18 years old so I really feel sorry for him plus youre divorced so that means you cant be trusted
youre a beautiful lady on the internet so of course you have at least one stalker. I hope he comes to harm.
wow 36  I thought you were in your 20s. please be safe out there...
that guy is nuts... everyone knows youre my future wife... lol... just kidding... Im happily married.  in a more serious note... be careful.  lots of crazies out there.
just dont go stalking me in parking lots  I am not bothered by funny internet comments no worries
lol damn what am I gonna do now
its true  butter does keep you looking younger.
wow  thats creepy.
stay safe. sorry for my comments wanting to kiss your neck. these real....weirdos need to be addressed. thankfully youre safe. also  get a gun. a glock really changes perspective.
I know you do  Im right here!...wait  another one!  kidding people  dont kill me
wow. the internet is a crazy place.
time for cwp possibly  but definitely mace  tear gas canister.
thats wild
this is way past just stalking.
family guy spider man  everybody gets one
this might be a bit drastic  but have you thought of moving to the uk   we ve new legislation against this  and stuff.
sounds like a guy going through some sort of mid life crisis aha. also  youre 36 ! I generally thought you were early 20s  not to be a creepy guy  got enough of those itseems
36   I thought you were late 20 s early 30 s. God I feel old now.
frustrating and annoying to watch. hope he goes to jail and get some therapy and this all becomes the past for you and you get to move on. I bet its hard to focus on making new content with this on your plate  but then again when you do make content it will show your resilience and strength. stay safe.
give him a handy and he ll go away.
youre 36... wow  I thought you were 22 or something... lol -- be careful out there.
maybe he mustache you to marry him.
your to fine for your own good
could do worse... seems like a nice fella.
was expecting someone... younger.
stay strapped sis.
Im sorry youre going through this but my one takeaway is... youre 36 ! I would have put money on that you were  like  28.
I was gonna make a celery joke but eh  too much effort.get a big dog  and a big gun to protect the dog.
why did they unsubscribe me  well im back and I hope you are doing good. happy new year
she puts the lotion on!
some men just cant take an l and move on. they think the women are playing hard to get delusional.
hopefully this will just stop. I cant believe you are 36. dam you look great.
maybe you can carry in your state.

holy hell.. 36  thought you were in your twenties to be very honest.
contact the police and how did he get your address
this really sucks. crazy people are scary. you just never know what they will do. surprised you dont have more stalkers though. hopefully this guy gets on some meds and stays away from you.
hw dare he stalk my melanie!
sorry to hear about some creep trying to ruin your life.  stay safe and I hope he ends up in prison.

this man needs professional help...
lmfao!

the 2nd amendment will help you. obits not safe to go alone. zelda reference.
this guy could be your grandfather.what a creepy dude
one things for sure.  he s not gonna find any women now.  . enjoy lonely golden years stalker
Jesus  I cant believe the weirdos out there.
tell that guy go get a job!
no new videos since this one
sorry Imade so many comments a friend of mins bf was shot by a stalker.  hes fine  but it tells me to tell you that ur in danger and anything he gives u dont accept them from him but when he leaves them for you keep it for your lawyers.
I just found out from another youituber. I am so sorry. I am sure you have a good social network and family to help you with protection issues like martial arts classes  firearm training  even taser training if legal out there  bear spray  pepper spray etc  and also bars locking windows and doors etc... also see if youtube has a way to make him not access youtube on there side. is that possible  I am not too techsmart  sorry. this sucks  and even worse he looks like 2-3 times your age! this dude is like a grandpa age. but it is 100  freaky. please be vigilant but do not live in fear. live with power and God and do not let him make you his victim. I want police to not let this man near you asap. pray for his mind. he is 100  not well.

very bold of him to think he s your type
sorry girl may the Lord protect you and also get a gun
I will pray for you  this is messed up. may God keep sending you with his angels. just dont freeze up if you have the gun or pull it  they will deffinitely go for it and use it against you.  if indeed this man happens to be mentally unstable  then might also consider a cctv cam and ask for police to do rounds if possible. never underestimate these folks if they get desperate. nobody deserves this. I remember when reportoftheweek had someone stalking him and circling in his area so he took a break till they sorted things out. psalm 91 11 - for he shall give his angels charge over thee  to keep thee in all thy ways.2 kings 6 16 elisha said   dont be afraid  for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them.
damn o_o dont want to give this video a thumbs up cause ya have a stalker    _  but do what ya gotta do girl  sigh honestly I also would recommend learning how to fight  _  like r.a.t. tactics kind of fight o_o some times ya gotta respect  no mercy
welp pal...time to execute on your second ammendment rights and installing a security system if you dont have one already.
if this isn t an argument for endorsement of open concealed carry  I dont know what is.
hire a 300lb gay ex-con to tell this guy he s going to be  his  wife.
scary stuff
you are a very attractive woman and alot of us would be lucky to know you etc etc  however  why does anyone think or feel the need to go to such crazy levels to find people  fuck me. I wouldn t even dream of messaging you let alone this. people are mental seriously. it is sad to say but he has the typical  Im a creep  look. how can anyone think someone was there future wife if they have never met them  they have never hung out  dont really know that person  be careful and gald you are safe
dont you own a gun  let him fuck around and find out
melmac was a strange planet located in the aldente nebula in the andromeda galaxy  ........and thats where you have to move now  with alf s people. I wouldn t drive 15 hours if you were homecooking a feast wearing my favorite color and we were gonna talk about me. thats too far in a car for a wife. hahabut for real  get a micro 9!!!!!
I believe u and its because a crazy little kid was doing that to me back in 2018 on xbox one I blocked him because he was saying him and hes dad was going to do a 2 way on me I am not gay and I dont mess with kids he made over 200 profiles  to fuck with me and say crazy shitso I understand
I think a 9mm revolver is 50 state legal Im just saying. but no one can can protect better than the Lord God bless you.
that is scary
good for you
he is making that video from inside what looks like a tractor trailer sleeper
Im sending frozen asian over
oh  and Im sure you ve already done this but in case you haven t  put it in writing that he is not welcome anywhere near you. if he messages you again  respond with his communication is not welcome in any way shape or form and you are already speaking with law enforcement about this. but.. and yes  Im a broken record on this one  have your own protection!!! the kind of protection that goes  pew pew pew   since I cant say that awful word on nazitube
if you have the evidence go to the policy and present them to them. none of us can do anything about it  and the policy can just accept things from the internet.
there he is  https   www.youtube.com watch v nilttx3eth8
cocaines a helluva drug
this guy is creepier than any child pred caught by chris hanson!!!!
boycotting anything witcher until the people who made the show pay shawn coss after stealing his artwork.
might be cold hearted but if you are stalking and begging a girl it ant happening and everyone one is entitled to a preference if you aren t attracted then you just are attracted no need to explain anything only wokesters  would force you to date someone you dont like.
good on the little boomers  escorting chief boomer to her car.
oh damn
dude  im 37.. noooo way youre 36!!! anyway  f that guy.  exposed
simple solution  marry him..if he s like most men he ll immediately lose interest and start pursuing other women. problem solved!
sean did nothing wrong
when I was 15 I was gonna marry loren southern.  I grew out of it!! and I sure as hell never drove to canada or messaged her a million times. ofcourse I never messaged her but thats besides the poin. please involve the police. your in danger.
get a guard dog
who   nah...where he at
he s in a semi-truck...
you sound slow
right just like the movie the hitcher circa 1983
@blakespower  so weird you said that...I was thinking of dual circa 1973 immediately after posting my comment...
she almost seems like she enjoys having a stalker and the attention it comes with it. whamen . also doxing is illegal sweetheart
lock him upppp!
so I usually dont try and speculate when it comes to people potentially committing additional crimes with not much to go on but... this is probably not this guy s first rodeo.
I want to hit the dislike button  I didn t  but that would affect you and not the target of my dislike. stay safe and youre in mine and many others prayers
sucks to say it  but shit like this unfortunately comes with the territory. the more famous you get and the bigger your channel gets the more psychos you ll be exposed too. always be aware of your surroundings  buy a gun  and learn how to use it.
holy shittttttttttttttttttttttttttt so so so so so sorry
I understand being spooked and looking for help and making this video.   but my guess is any kind of acknowledgement of this guy  even if negative towards him  will feed his delusion.  once you start getting the help you need  you should never acknowledge this guy publicly ever again unless asked and keep itshort and simple.
hey.......that term is offensive to all the grocery stalkers around the world.......just stalking up food
can I go to youse guise wedding  molotov
that is so dam weird...
scary
if ur reading this  drink some water.
you are maybe giving him what he wants. attention. should have went to the cops straight away tbh.
first of all go get a restraining order against him. I know it wont stop someone who needs mental help but you can at least get him arested each time he breaks it. understand theres not much the police can do but at least notify your local police and think about getting some security guards. the police cant arrest him unless he accually does something unfortunatly. do talk to the police and  lawyers and let them tell you how to handle this is the best advise I can give.
youre 36   wow  I was thinking mid 20s. no wonder your opinions are so rational and intelligent. you got some years  lol
omg....jeeze
this was in texas  the dude mustve not been from here then. cuz majority probably dont know you  like I did till this  and no one here does that lol. sorry it happened here though.
everyone knows you are only married if you like a youtube reply. twitter doesnt count.
its called 9mm. get one  learn to use it  be prepared and be aware.
what in the hell is wrong with people....  doesnt he have any personal pride
thank you  I am
@melonie mac go boom  good seed
well if you weren t so damn gorgeous
who is this girl and why do I sub to her lol
yo girl to be honest you guys are cute together!!!
this is why we nedd the 2nd and the death penalty s
scary......
I dont know the laws in your state but you should consider firearms training for yourself. I dont like firearms but I think this is a situation that calls for it.
get yourself a weapon and the training to use it  and dont forget the ccw permit. sometimes violence is the best solution to a problem...
I dont believe you.there s no way youre 36.no way.
can you afford a professional bodyguard  if you can front the cost itshould be a tax write-off.
let s cancel this uncle stan
a .44 magnum would solve this problem
pls get a carry permit if you can where u live  learn to shoot unless you already do all that
world is full of mentally ill people price for being online personality. sorry you are going though this. stay safe
wow
holy sh   .  people cray cray
gee what a shocker youre on the internet youre beautiful and youre surprised you have a stalker
kind of fucked up that you wont just marry him dude
and from the sounds of it you never gave him a college try!!!
soooo will stalker become a gender
huh...some people
wtf ! a stalker ! f n weird! sorry about that  melonie.
the cops will not be there when you need them. please please carry pepper spray or get your concealed carry!!!!!
can we talk about this guy s room he s filming in    is he trapped inside of a colorless plastic futurepod  is klaus schwab forcing him to eat ze bugs so that he vil own nothing and be happy
lol. at the same time if he looked like henry cavill and drive 15 hours to see you.  omg like that is so cute
aw jeez
I would of never guess 36
Imean if it ended after u shut him down it would be extremely creepy but sweet but now hes like u need to buy a gun mode. like this guy looks like hes got one....and probably some meth...definitely not the right vibe having a van...
youre talking about shivering and what are your things and you agree that one guy you want to find your hero then maybe you should accept people from wanting to talk to you a man want to talk to you and basically ask you out because the most serious thing you and him can both do together it has nothing to do with being a stalker whatsoever
definition of a creep
dammit! way to bring down people named  sean  like me  creep!in all seriousness  thank God nothing bad happened to you.
its oddly less flattering than you think it would be.
what !
your super cute but I wouldn t drive more than 45 minutes to stalk you. gas is really expensive now and a stalker has to get the most bang for his stalking buck.
you should stay with your family or friends for a while. this is some creepy shit.
its your fault women for being that cute  -p  joke
what the what!
I got news for you if you are internet famous most of your fans are  weird  and  creepy
wtffffffff
whts your only fans
its not his fault your hot
@talynstarburst  most guy fans of her are going to be mostly creepy mersh types sorry to say it kinda comes with being internet famous  is he creepy yes but criminal Im not so sure also it was a  meet and greet  conveniently around the time to 100k subs for her smh
no offense melonie it just sounds like you got creeped out which I understand but using an awkward interaction with a fan from a  meet and greet  is a little sus
wait wait wait  so you are telling me that the dream I had of me being a king and 23 again with you as my princess...its not going to come true.... I guess ill be 63 until next year
why do they always come creepy and rapey  why cant there be a cillian murphy or anime-looking
I heard you had a stalker before I heard of you. I literally never heard of melanie mack before a youtuber was talking about you as if I had heard of you..youre more famous for your stalker than you are
all I know is if its God s plan  he ll see it through. this is this guy s plan  its not the same  he s trying to force it and this is not how that works.
its brian redban
dudes listen to me clearly. falling for hot chicks is cool. simp if you must but if you and her parents graduated the same year. just dont. try this instead you must have beautiful parents are they divorcedsorry mel the desire to be a troll out weighs my need to simp hope he gives it up
youre 36 and he was going out to you while I feel sorry for him and the words of kevin samuels the lake county cinemas and 36 your goodwill when a woman gets it to her 30s 40s 50 she s goodwill
hope cops get him soon
two things..read psalms 91 everyday! sit in it meditate on it and read it out loud.the second thing..get a gun! dont play!let me tell you a story of a friend of mine.Imet her online playing video games. she was young and she was looking for friends online and she pursued a relationship with me.I believe the Lord led her to me and it wasn t long after we became friends thatshe began confiding in me about things that were going on in her life.her family was abusive towards her.she was in a very bad living situation which they soon after threw her out of the house and she was homeless.she did manage to find a place after a nail biting season but her brother was threatening to kill her and he was the kind of person that was capable of doing it.I was sharing the love of God with her and explained that God would protect her according to psalms 91 and maybe a week later he got in a car accident and died.I dont believe God would have taken him out like that unless she was in really danger but that was one of the moments in my life that when youre a believer that God is serious like a heart attack about your protection.its very important though that we receive it by faith.there s something about faith that builds up in our hearts and we speak that faith when we feed on God s word.faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God so spend a lot of time in psalms 91.dont take your protection for granted
I think women and men  young or old  should learn martial arts and how to use weapons and aim accurately. we live in dangerous times.
so sorry youre being faced with this shit. just awful and scary.
go to your local gun shop and buy your self some faith
sell me your call of duty headsel
holy fuck
I hope he gets arrested be self
was this a doxxing .
too lazy too stalk
be safe. dont forget about the 2nd amendment. defend yourself.
sad world. buy a gun. stay safe.
wtf
idk I think you should give him a shot  seems like a nice guy
time to practice the good ole 2nd amendment as well
Jesus Christ.
dad
freaks man....
why
creepy dude
somehow this dude is mostly delusional. the last thing anyone wants to have is a violent stalker.
buy a gun or 20.
its similar to that taylor swift song.
more proof of why the 2nd amendment is more important than ever.
its sad and pathetic.
shit like this is why I carry and why I taught my wife and kids how to shoot.
jeez youre cute but God. stalking is too damn much.
freaky. good that he posted his degeneracy online  though. be safe.
15 hours  he sounds like a cheap person why not just fly much faster
ugh  stalkers are creepier than even democratic senators.hopefully the dude gets some help and leaves you alone.
Im sorry
pew pew
oh  you get stalkers too
cavalier is dead and this guys the freaking zombie.
I hope you and your dad are packing heat. this is fucking scary.
so  this honestly seems a little overblown lmao. sure  the dude seems weird  but like  come on. nothing happened here.
tha fuq
guns  go. stalkers should have a good idea of what happens when they partake in their activity  and itshouldn t be anything remotely resembling encouragement.
no woman no modern woman at that is worth stalking over the internet grow up and speak to women in real like. makes men look bad. some people just cant help it. hope this dude get some help.
Im rooting for the stalker  lol
humble brag
oof  I cringe.
I dont want this to sound like I am questioning the validity of your story but does he actually use your name in the video
well its not me.    I suggest taking a ccw course if you ve not already.  dont outsource personal safety.  youreally need to be responsible for your own safety as cops are not legally obligated to protect you  but instead exist only to enforce law.  just ask the uvalde and parkland kids.
the level of delusion on this guy. be safe lady  we live in dangerous times.
40-80 year old stalkers unless you are fabulously wealthy  what makes you think an attractive young female would like you
you dont sound texan. where is your accent originally from  itsounds midwestern.
also it also looks like yellowflash is stalking you too
he is lying because your mine
its a compliment to be  stalkable . I guess... maybe...
you should consider getting a firearm
seems a bit old for you.
wait  its happening on discord  lol what you expect  the curse of discord strikes again. its in the name  discord brings only discord
Im an army brat who lived all over so I dunno  but I lived in upstate new york the longest in my developmental years anyway
no  he s my friend and brought attention to the situation...
@melonie mac go boom  ok if you say so  its just usually when this stuff happens they always tend to do that  its like clockwork.
no  it didn t happen on discord. my moderators from discord have been helping me with this is what I said.
suprised  this guy thinks the earth is flat he looks like
I stalk melonie in her dreams.
why do americans us time as a measure of distance it makes no sense. with the exemption of light years thats fine.
remember men  no e-girls. ever.
so long as you dont go feminist and say  all men are bad   I wish well for your safety and hopefully the stalker will be apprehended and rightfully persecuted.
haha thats what happens when you dont hide your face
15 hours is a long road to drive just to probably get rejected. thats more like a religious pilgrimage. you got to convince yourself to put all your marbles in  fate destiny magic  to even attempt such a trip.and then reality sets in. reality that he s just a lonely old man desperate to cling to any remote validation he s gotten from a woman who lives halfway across the country  but he s an unappealing creep who can barely speak up when he gets his chance to talk to you. destiny didn t insert him into your life just for making the effort to show up  and he s embarrassed himself. so now he s lost all shame and has nothing to lose at trying to force himself into your life even if its by negative means now. he cant make you like him less now  but if he can enter your sphere at all its a religious win for him.
thats not impressive... I took three different planes and drove 36 hours to stalk you
exercise your 2nd amendment rights. he is a creep.
his age makes itso much worse. predatory even if you aren t a child cause youre a child by comparison.
chrissie joke was in extremely poor taste
waste of fuel
good conservative men  walking a girl to her car  especially if its getting dark  is basic behavior. especially in the land of the freedom were criminals are more valued than honest people.
I thought people only stalked hot chicks  oh well.
now that you have made a 22 minutes video about him he s gonna think that you love him. its gonna get worse. so very very very very very bad decision. have you heard about feeding the troll.... well a stalker is a troll on steroids...  also dont waste your time going to the police  the police cant do absolutely nothing about it nor shouldn t care unless he makes a serious threat.  no mattter what they tell you. you said that you had to make this video for your own safety... funny that you think that this video is gonna protect you somehow... if anything he could get really pissed off now  thinking  I was nice to her and look what she s done ...good news is that he doesnt look particularly dangerous  but my advice to you would have been  dont make the video!!!
I just talked about some good men in this video  so clearly I dont think all men are bad
@melonie mac go boom  thank you  melonie .
wow... this is annoying.
no offense but you were at a  public event and you got creeped out def not a crime. to put out a video like this to gain subs is kinda shameful ewww you pretty much turned mersh get a real job get off the net for  while
lol  what a loser. everyone point and laugh. 15 hours driven for a girl he doesnt even know who wants nothing to do with him  bravo. must be on quite the losing streak.I hope you pick up a strap and keep it ready. police cant do anything until it is too late often times.
better show evidence
I get so tired of the God stuff.  if God helped you  then he also sent this guy as well.  he also gives children cancer and puts people in the world that murder regularly.
it wasn t 15 miles it was 15 hours
@goats miserable  sorry thats what Imeant to type
haha we re close and we already talked privately about everything  she has been super supportive. I thought her joke was hilarious  sometimes you just gotta laugh through the struggle lol!
@melonie mac go boom  well if youre okay with it then fine    happy new years and stay safe mel
but if he was hot  it d be  chivalrous.
dont age shame.
yea I dont care
Im a cop  you should marry the guy before he changes his mind  he seems like a real catch..
shameless making it into khantent.
God wasn t protecting you .  it was two human men who walked you to your car lol.
why would you go to church church is boring
Ive said it elsewhere and I ll say it here  a man should approach any woman as if she might be a future wife as if shes that precious that makes a man s intentions respectful projecting that my intentions were unsound by omitting  if  is defamatory  I regarded you in due cordiality  miss
she is  reaching  out to the police or she has reached out to the police  big difference. if you make a video before calling police how worried is she really
typical liberals.
53k views and 6k likes  how many dislikes  Ive noticed youre scurrying to scrub the comments of people calling you out for this.
maybe if you dont always make your videos in your underwear  you might not have a stalker. prevention before cure sister
contact the authorities and move on  this video is base attention seeking based behavior for clicks.
you seem like the type to think that guns are icky and scary so I wont bother.
4 20 he did not think you were his wife. he clearly said  gonna.  no need to misrepresent the poor bastard that we all know would be considered  persistent  if it was a hot guy with resources.
sounds like he s a trump supporter given his behavior and comments
maybe the guy likes  you and was just trying to be nice and or get a date.  calling the guy a stalker is peak toxic feminism.
nah  a hot guy can slide in my dm s  not drive 15 hours to stalk me in a parking lot. that ain t cool regardless of who does it.
@melonie mac go boom  fair enough.
youre 36 ! unsubscribed
this is 22 min of babble.  most of the time when women say think they are being stalked  its just because the guy isn t as attractive as they want.  I tried fast forwarding trying to get to the point of the video but itseems like she never gets to one.  was she actually being stalked  or is this just more female nonsense
keep appealing to the toxic masculine right.
divine providence can be worked through human agency.
two men I just met that day  and under normal circumstances absolutely never happens to me  carpool situation too . I have not had a man walk me to my car in over half a year until this ordeal. most guys dont.God absolutely worked through them to protect me  and they deserve props too for wanting to do so of course
right  she should ve contacted police first and then posted the whole thing later after the investigation. but alas we live in the world where people care more about internet clout than their actual safety.
already reached out to the police  made this video and public posts for my own safety because he would not leave me alone and just because I talked to the police does not mean I am automatically safe
no  he would not stop harassing me and police investigations take a long time. I talked to the police and Imade this public for my own safety  which turned out to be the right move because he would not stop harassing me until Imade this public
I haven t deleted a single comment
calling her out for what  bruh...
@talynstarburst  that was something youtube did years ago. your comments are filtered out  depending on what you type. put in something that youtube doesnt like  your comment will be shadow blocked from public view. you can see it  but the general public cannot. thats why you have comment threads that have 14 replies  but you can only see 8. typical power move  if there ever was one!
what on earth are you waffling on about
welp being as I own one and said it in this video  youre not very good at judging people or watching a video before commenting
