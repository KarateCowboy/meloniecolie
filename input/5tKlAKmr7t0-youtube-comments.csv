people who identify as gamers are less likely to accept our cult dogma
this is why gatekeeping is actually important. keep those lunatics away from our passion.
if lunatics think gamers are bigots  I consider that a badge of honor.
these people are so toxic. they try to guilt trip us and then gaslight us while belittling us. love your goku outfit!
Im not sure telling a group of competitive people that they re the best at something will work out how they think it will.
studies like these can also be considered gatekeeping in a sense. they make gaming look bad for the sole purpose of keeping people away from it. the gates are kept by people who feel they cannot enjoy the hobby themselves  so they push others away with myths. I play fighting games. very competitive genre. in my experience  I rarely get a toxic message. when I get messages at all  its usually  good games  or a compliment on how well I played my character. although  to be fair  it could be communities of the games I choose to play that have generally wholesome communities.
I really dont understand how game journos still exist though  I worked for multiple gamestop s and best buy s in my life and have never had anybody be sexist to me. I have been gaming since 4 and I am 30 now. the gaming community has been nothing but welcoming to me my whole life. it was always the popular people  mostly women  who bullied me and were awful. the cod lobby thing is so true  those insults are hilarious to me  I just gave it right back at them. smack talk is funny.
if the evils of today consider you a villain  youre doing something right.
we need to pull the credentials of these people who make up this study.  better yet  pull the funding of the organizations that dont bother to review the  study.
first off I wanted to give you praise for your costume choice. Im a huge fan.  second these weirdos can be in the same space as us but the problem is that when we let them they take it over and change it into their image. they aren t nerds like us  they are posers that are truly activist. this is why many of us dont trust them with our precious franchises.
in other words  young men are still the primary demographic of people who play videogames  and that brings with it all the immature behaviors you would expect.the study should really just be summarized  gamers are people .
sadly we have to gatekeep to keep things we love from being destroyed  though Im not entirely sure the best way to do it . the most annoying thing is all the gaslighting about not being allowed into the hobby. every gamer I know  board game  video game  whatever  is absolutely thrilled to get people involved in their hobby. we re almost always starved for participants. sure  there are elitists jerks in every hobby but there are so many decent people Im sick of seeing them dragged through the mud for having fun wrong.
awesome costume
melonie is over 9000 in this one
only thing I heard about gamers recently was that we had better memory and impulse control.
identity fusion  her saying that while wearing a goku gI put me into such a giggle fit
I love the goku costume melonie. you look absolutely amazing. you rock! love it
I love studies in general they re so flawed because what they take is a small subset of people and then determine that thatsmall subset is the entirety of whatever group they are studying studies in general like this are extremely flawed you get better results from family feud
we gamers are not sexists nor racists never was  never will be
you know its serious when melonie shows up in her space warrior outfit.
this
the truth
boom
fact
correction   are less likely to accept our cultural marxist dogma.
@justin reschke  lol is that the black adam salute
gamers are less accepting of being force-fed nihilism .
and there it is.
exactly  I agree
cleanhouse
yes  but to an extent. we dont want to exclude enthusiastic newcomers or be overzealous gate keepers but instead weed out these narcissistic name callers...first   they cause violence now  all gamers are bigots reee why is nerd culture always under attack from some whiny dipstick
@the faceless enigma  probably because gamers dont give the reaction they want  so they keep pushing further game makes people violent ok  I dont care  me and my friends are not violent so wherever gamers are sexists and racists you still talking to me
everything is far right because of how way left they all have become. left out. lol
after seeing all the ruined franchises that litter the  nerd culture  I have actually switched to pro gatekeeping. the gates must be defended.
@rodrigo takehara  ye gamers are not going to protest against it. activists on the other hand are protesting and media appeals to them.this destroys the games for a while now and I would like to believe its going to change but its whishfull thinking
@the faceless enigma  exclude  no but come in here with some God damn respect. Im a black man and know its racist assholes in here but that doesnt even make close to the majority of gamers. my longest friendships are with people all over the world  different races and genders. journalists hate us because they ain t us. thatsimple.
@the spiteful artist   indeed and yes  when entering the game world be respectful.journalists are a dying thing in my opinion   back before internet  they reported news  now...we can get so much info anywhere. now journalists just do fluff pieces or controversy...or attack those who dont support the dogmatic way that keeps them funded.
@rodrigo takehara  exactly  its like those bullies in school who pick on the kid who alone or socially different.  nobody does anything  but when they lash out to fight back  they get in trouble.these fools target us geeks and nerds because we think and are happy with our franchises.
Imean  my whiteness  maleness  straightness  blue collar occupation  and rural background were all problematic signs of inherent bigotry  why not my hobbies  too
@melvin deeply  old tops
show me your friends  I ll show you who you are. taking a look at your enemies is probably at least as enlightening lol.
@melvin deeply  idk  its a bit freeing to shit out in nature lolas long as the mosquitoes aren t about.
but they can identify themselves as a 9 year old humanx girl butterfly fairy thatswings all ways and they call it  stunning and brave .
@melvin deeply  oh  you want to be an inside toilet  la dee friggin da  look who s gotten all high and mighty...
@melvin deeply  lmao!
lunatics are being bigoted to gamers as a result. irony.
read part of the study. I couldn t get through the first 5 pages coz of the bias of the researcher and the amount of woke buzzwords. the hate of games and gamers just dripped from every sentence. in case you didn t knew her ideology... quote   after exclusions we had 304 participants  gender  146 males  155 females  3 non-binary  age  19 77  ethnicity...  also note that the n  too low to state their conclusion anyway. itshould have ended in  the study suggests  or something of that nature. you cant say definitive shit with such a low amount of participants. the first pages is also riddled with the sterotypes  call of duty  etc. and the methods of the study... basically asking a set of questions and assume based on their own woke bias that the answers of those questions are .... insert all the woke buzzwords  which clearly lack any connection to the asked question.also... gamers are like  why dont you piss off  will ya  this is nothing more then escapism  you dont see lunies like you making the same studies about movies now  do we
original tangsters
gamers are one of the biggest groups that eat up this woke stuff and are high and mighty about it.  its infected the entire industry.
truly
the only correct response is k
pin of truth
@melonie mac go boom   lol ! a goku suit. its over 9000 cuteness level
gamers are the only ones that pushed back. other forms of entertainment like movies and tv gave in like nothing.
well  the word  gamer  itself came itself as kind of a cult  or maybe more of a merchandised label. I still remember how people never called themselves  gamers  they just  liked playing games . it wasn t a explicitsubculture  nor an excuse to buy gamer pcs  gamer chairs  gamer shoes  gamer headphones  gamer streams  etc  it has always been a marketing scheme since around 2003-2005. I wouldn t feel any pride in calling myself a gamer  I know it looks like the equivalent of people shaming on  poser  people for skaters or goths for example  but it is what it is.
@goofy grandlouis  tell master roshI I said hello. but seriously you rock that outfit!
@stijnvdv2  thats an oddly familiar turn of phrase. cultural marxism. reminds me of cultural bolshevism. you know  the third reich used the latter
imagine thinking youre part of some epic rebellion because you play video games...
thats racist....... sarcasm
pretty much.
true!
also apply to gaming peripheral for pc
@doctor profesor  yeah the term came with the cultists  it was around 2010-11 I think when I heard this word for the first time... and already then I thought it had a cultish stink to it.Ive been playing games since late  90 and never thought of calling myself a gamer...
you winflawless victory
@elders crawler  ikr  it has always sound cringy to me.
guess thats why Ive been able to resist their rhetoric. because Ive been a gamer all my life.
@cucker tarlson  those aren t gamers  those are people who played a mobile game for an hour and think that makes them gamers.
@sammysam7x  until lotr fans joined in. they pushed back pretty hard too when rings of power started its marketing.
@elders crawler  Ive been a gamer my entire life. that term has been around far longer than 2010  pal. I knew that term since I could pick up a controller.
@doctor profesor  no  being a gamer simply means playing video games is one of your favorite hobbies if not favorite . it has never been about those things you mentioned. those things are a specific sub-class of gamers that tend to think they re better than other gamers mostly pc gamers . the term gamer has been around at least as long as Ive been alive.
@hawkcam1996  except it never was and if you think that way  you may have been in deep for too long. if you ever called yourself unironically gamer in the 90s or 00s it was never a thing or  any of those things you mentioned . also bringing the console vs pc war thing into this tells me you have no idea of what youre talking about.
@doctor profesor    you said  gamer pcs  gamer chairs  which pc gamers use  gamer shoes  gamer headphones  gamer streams  which started with pc gaming long before consoles got involved in streaming  etc. thatsounds an awful lot like stuff that primarily applies to pc gamers  not console gamers  and pc gamers have generally always looked down on console gamers  so yes I do know what Im talking about. sounds to me like youre the one thats full of it. the term gamer has been around the entire time Ive been playing video games  which is pretty much my entire life  ever since I could pick up a controller. the very fact that there s a distinction between pc gamers and console gamers in the first place means the gamer term is intrinsically linked to gaming in general.
@spike  imagine thinking you are superior because youre woke
@doctor profesor  I dont understand what s cringe about it. I play and enjoy video games. I say Im a gamer  like on a social profile or something  to let people know that its a hobby past time that I enjoy  in the hopes of meeting other people into it as well. its a simple descriptor  nothing more.
@hawkcam1996  yeah  its unbelievable to me that this is even an argument.
simply because we gamers are the 10  cool and the others are not
which is why they re going to try to ban this passion.
cool so is it ok if I gatekeep the rpg genre so that crap games like elden ring dont get thrown into the mix. I would like a good story in my rpg please.
@the faceless enigma   I will gate keep the hell out of rpgs because Im sick of people trying to make rpgs to gamed with no story.people did not play final fantasy 4 just for the game play same goes with 6  7  and 9. they played them because of the great story.
you shouldn t gatekeep. you should let people into your hobby. they even brought you a gift.just look at this giant wooden horse. isn t it nice
we need to create our own stories so we can protect them.
@evacody124  apparently it has  I couldn t say from myself I haven t play it    because you have to do some archeological work with items and web pages aaaand then you have that great world building...
should always have been
you literally have no power of gatekeeping anyone  you never had it  and you will never have. only those who have the money to buy the licenses have that power  you dont  I dont  no one else does.
@evacody124  that is why people play video games  to emerge themselves into a world of fantastic design and rich characters.
@makor  yes we do  with the products we consume.
@john miller  there is no world building in elden ring.
@the faceless enigma   thats why people play rpgs. the issue is every mel says people just want an interactive story.no I want there thr looters shooters and action platform games to stay away from my rpgs. I dont play skyrim for just the combat. no one does. they play it for the amount of storytelling is in the game. take that out and you are left with nothing.
@evacody124  as I said before  I didn t play it  the thing I know is they hired george r.r. martin to create the world and very important is that those games  fromsoftware  they dont make the story for a player to enjoy normally you have to see videos  look in websites  look at the objects and then you have what they call a story...I dont lile those games  still there are people who does.
can I get a rrrrrrrrreeeeee
yeah it was so much easier in the 80s and 90s when all you had to worry about was jack thompson and the esrb lol
kotaku  ign and polygon.
most gamers dont gatekeep these people. just new fans in general are honestly very angry at new games existing. so we are in no luck at all there.
@evacody124  um thats not gatekeeping and elden ring is a western rpg. its existence doesnt effect any other game.
and why traditions are important  keeps the weirdos from corrupting things into degeneracy.
let s hope elitist scumbags dont ruin fun out of games  then we can agree with whole  gatekeeping
@the faceless enigma  this I can behind with
based
@the spiteful artist   its not an rpg. an rpg needs a story. the character needs a reason to be in the world they are in and a reason to fight. what s the reason in elden ring  there is none. there is no city with npcs to talk to. there are no books to find its just kill mobs for loot. its a looter  shooter. tell me you dont play rpgs with out telling me.
@chandler burse  I will gate keep rpgs. if new fans want to come in fine. leave the action platform no story crap at the door. if I want that I will play sonic or something like call of duty.
@evacody124  what
@evacody124  its literally a western rpg. the story is the discovered lore itself. it was made in japan and categorized as an rpg. sorry bud youre solo on this one
@red sea gaming  I know  but at what point will gatekeeping is good enough  there are people bashing people for making fan art of characters from anime that is not  lore  accurate or elitists expect everyone to min max and bash blizzard for not bring back broken builds into wow retail
@the faceless enigma  honestly gatekeeping types of people are usually the bullies not the other way around.
facts
man... as someone who s been into d d since  97  more gatekeeping should have been done
@chandler burse   this is true  however as one commenter above put it   be respectful. I give newcomers  benefit of the doubt and if they are having trouble  I d help them. thats my gatekeeping  help the new ones find their path  but I kick toxic people to the curb. there are toxic normies who aren t fans and want to change a franchise lore to suit their feelings or sense of identity. they are there to  correct  not enjoy a story.
@melvin deeply  I agree  is gamers are big open trapdoors wait
aye
I love being a bigot!
@stijnvdv2  yup. a little over 300 is far too small a sample size.now if she d checked out 10 different communities within the same genre at 300  people  so a total of over 3000  than it might be worth the paper it was written on.oh and do note the  within the same genre  qualifier. as communities differ per genre.highly competitive genres  like fps  have a differing atmosphere than the rpg or puzzle communities to give some examples.yes  should be obvious  but apparently it isn t to her if she compares cod to minecraft communities.thats like comparing a wolf to a labrador. they might be related  but they re not going to exhibit 1 to 1 behaviour patterns.
at this point yeah
indeed.  to be damned by the devil is to be truly blessed .
bigot of honor  flame warfighter
even if these twits spotted a  bigot   what are they going to do it about  throw stuff at their windows and end up in jail  do these people not have better things to do such as glue themselves to buildings
same here brother!
I have met a lot of mysogynists  sexists  racists  bigots  know it alls  egotists  narcissists  and all the rest  in the clans I have been in and online games I have played. I think in general there is a lot of low self-esteem amongst gamers and as a result they talk themselves up and put others down. not all that putting others down is  smack-talk.  having said the above  Imet more mysogynists  sexists  racists  bigots  know it alls  egotists  narcissists  and all the rest when I served in the military  the prison service  the it industry and law. these people were not the minority either  I feel the  few bad apples  myth is strong in gaming  there are too many bad apples for them to be called a  few. gaming culture is not the main problem  the world has a problem. though  you dont need to be  woke   to know a lot of the world s cultures are broken.
dont kid yourself  I see a lot of deragatory language that doesnt belong in gaming and I am happy to say that I have got a lot of toxic players banned from their online accounts  with pride and I wear that as a badge of honor.
a coworker of mine told me that he is a lactose bigot.
@diogenes dworkinson  here here
@stijnvdv2  they have done movies and t.v................
@geddoe316  you should not lovebeing a horseshoe person!
@proud to be jewish  and people like you are why video games are easy as heiI now. youre too soft. all that  derogatory language  is just smack talk  like melanie max said. its common in all competitive arenas  especially sports. its a tactic  not bigotry.
thats right  you canthink of it as a problem if they approve of you at all
@diogenes dworkinson  my strong in-group preference somehow still allows me to not hate others.
@proud to be jewish  how did you achieve that
@diogenes dworkinson  none of what you just said actually made any sense  but then again there is a lot of stupid people here on the internet who say a lot of stupid things that they cant bother to take the time to substantiate.care to elaborate on any specific points or are you just going to continue to jump from one non-sequitur to another  with zero context honestly  I could care less what you believe  but when your beliefs offend a group of people  know that there will be consequences.  today in germany  the criticism of my people is considered a huge crime  this is how itshould be all over the world.  in soviet-russia it was punishible by death.it was offensive language and stereotypes that led us to over 6 million of us being exterminated and I do not wish to repeat this history  which is why all speech must be controlled.I support censorship  I also support the state-sponsored re-education programs for those who dissent against my political beliefs and I think its important for peoples of european heritage to feel perpetually guilty for the sins of their fathers and fore-fathers.that might come off as tyrannical  but my people have learned from history and will do what is necessary to curb hate-speech of any form in every western country regardless of your  liberal values.
