you know brie is in full karen mode when her eyes become a wide eyed stare  and then she starts speaking like an annoyed kindergarten teacher.
what directors and writers fail to comprehend now is that generally neither men nor women care about the gender of the characters  they care about the characters simply being well-written and entertaining.
personally  as a dude  its just nice to have a woman understand some of the things that we go through on a daily basis and to have that female voice of support that isnt calling us an animal or monster for one reason or another.
I am a man and in my top 5 favorite protagonists of all time  xena at number 3. across all forms of media entertainment btw  video games  film  television  etc . beautiful  kicks ass  appeals to both women and men  and an early bI icon without constantly shoving it down our throats or even acting like she cares. good writing goes a long way and casting talented people to play them goes the extra mile.
I think bries more mad thatshe had the full backing of hollywood until the public stopped giving a damn about captain marvel  then they dropped her fast because its blatantly obvious that no one likes working with her.
hearing the female perspective on the culture war is a nice addition. your right in the sense that most women I know are inspired by things they find beautiful or ideals of beauty they want to achieve. marketing unlikable female characters is not going to make anyone happy except the twitter brigade and we know how much money they contribute lol.
great point mel - I could never figure out why they re pushing disney princesses so hard in a genre thats largely a male demographic. but its simple - you win women  you get thorin s treasure room.
women like pretty feminine women! if I want to see masculine power  I ll stick to my male video games and entertainment  which I also love . I cringe so much when I see female characters masculinized. I assure you  the people they re pandering to will never play their games or watch their entertainment. their only entertainment is playing the victim and destroying and deconstructing norms.and  I think the main reason you attract males is not just the looks  youre stunning of course   but the fact that youre so sincere and straight to the point. you speak your mind  women usually try to avoid conflict of any kind. you keep to your values  provide awesome commentary.congrats on your 40 k btw.
they literally think that the very idea that diverse women are on screen makes us angry and afraid.
congratulations on 40k subscribers melonie. you brought up a lot of good points. I dont think Ive heard any kpop songs. but their style looks so much better then what was going on with the m-she-u picture. yes youre beautiful  but thats not why I started following you. what really hooked me was learning that your a Christian and how open you are about your faith. then the fact that youre a tomboy and all the fun  cool stuff youre into. Imean  I think your one of the most amazing women on the planet. I dont have a problem supporting you at all. good video. take care melonie.
thanks for being you! especially when you can still respect opinions you dont agree with.
brie always looks like she wants to complain about the criticism aimed towards her but she hides her frustration with a fake  cute   quirky   personality.
sydney watson recently posted  the failure of feminist hollywood  with some of the best editing work Ive seen in a long time.  I haven t seen anything that paints a clearer picture of what is going on with hollywood than this.
congrats on 40k subs. I always enjoy watching your videos. this whole brie thing is just hilarious. she s just terrible  and I dont even know who the other women are in that photoshoot  tbh. side note  if I did something to offend get muted on twitter  I apologize.
I first clicked on your channel to get a woman s perspective on shehulk   big fan of hulk myself especially the 90 s animated . I subscribed to the channel because you weren t on the man-hating band wagon and that you were keeping it real and I value your take on different topics.  it is refreshing to find that there are women out there that are supportive and hold themselves to a higher value than the values perpetuated by the lame  stream media .
hey melanie. yes youre attractive not just looks but your faith in Christ our Lord  youre a true gamer  youre honest no matter how uncomfortable it may be  you love your audience  youre not a crazy liberal lol and I as an arab man who s Christian which is rare alllll of that adds to why I always watch your videos. I dont stare at the screen drooling over you  but I listen to what you say. just like brett cooper  ben shapiro jordan peterson eric july aka youngrippa etc. I think many of the people who watch you think the same. minus some not being Christian ofc but other than that yeah you got dudes who simp over you ofc but but I think by the comments youre entertaining to listen too not just simp over which is great   im glad you do this. another favorite youtuber and subscriber of mine God bless you and may your channel grow inshallah.
congrats on hitting 40k!  as much as brie was fuming you could practically see red laser eyes there haha.  great seeing you on fnt again and looking forward to seeing you on there again.  you being beautiful is obvious  but its true you are.  I like many others follow you mainly because youre awesome.  tomboys have great personality too and fun to hang with.  one of best friends is a tomboy and Ive been friends with her for ever itseems lol
melanie always has such a funny take on things  poor brie  she really should go on jeremy s show  the quartering
first off congrats on 40k subs and awesome job on fnt this past friday.
she s genuinely creepy af  she needs to be sent off already  but thats what she gets for being ok with being a puppet for the message  live with your mistakes  she s continuously digging her own career into the ground
the way she does at any given time on any given day  I think everything other than  full-karen  is just her trying to pretend to be normal.
annoyed kindergarten teacher   I cantotally see her screaming  shut uuuuuuup!!  arnie style to all her critics. which is everyone
if the wide eye stare scares you  have a look at her feet
@oioioioio  ...when her eyes become wide and the ree thatshe shines can be screamed... steven! I dissmiss you not the bell take your seat and behaaaaave....
....ooh the more I yell at you the better I feel  ayeahh  yeyeehh ....
...now that my class isn t zoom  shut up in your seats and behaaave!lada da dada dada dat daaaahh
you know brie is in full karen mode when she s awake there  fixed it...
if you know anything about her she was trained to use her eyes for acting. her acting coach would make sit and or keep her hands behind her back when acting out scenes so thatshe had to use her eyes to convey. she does that in all her roles and I think its just become a part of her especially she s being interviewed this is a part of the business.
thats not exactly true at all.. its vandalism when you key a car when you put graffitI on a building without permission. this is no different considering stan lee didn t give people permission to make a female thor when thor is based on a culture that dates back thousands of years. just like ariel is based on european folklore not african folklore. it would be really fucked up taking wonder woman turning her into a man when she s based on the amazonians a group of women tribe which they did use men as slaves and sex slaves so.  now if the original creator changed their work thats their right to.
I can just see her as a librarian.  be quiet!
the difference its the annoyed kindergarten teacher has reasons to be annoyed and yelling  kids are exhausting specially in big groups  but a pampered billionaire celebrity acting like that doesnt make any sense
wait.....what do you mean full karen mode  I thought that was her entire personality.
even if its small  there s a group of women out there who respect men  Imyself am one. I think men are amazing  Im grateful to have been protected by you guys on the daily. I hope this woke culture dies out soon for everyone s sake
she had the backing of hollywood until she massively overplayed her hand and made herself totally unlikeable  so hollywood had no other choice than to stop backing her because she s pure toxic now. she literally went from hero  of the sjw woke movement  to zero  hated by both the normal crowd  nd the sjw woke movement  because of her toxicity. hollywood marvel had set up captain marvel to be the leader of the phase 4 avengers  but because of brie larsons stupidity she s been dishonourably discharged.
@tj roelsma  let s be honest  captain marvel being the flagship hero of the avengers and the mcu was a pipe dream. it was never gonna work in the cinema  and itsure as hell didn t work in marvel comics and they tried pushing her for the last 12 years. comic book fans liked carol danvers when she was still ms. marvel  myself included  but since they turned her into captain marvel  she became an unlikable character.
we need more people like you for real
facts!
I cantestify as a male that its nice to hear a woman speak out about these issues  its very comforting to know that even women are fed up with this garbage and narrative being forced in media especially since the people making the change dont even consume the media they destroy! also you are very beautiful and very concise with the way you say things.
exactly
can you define  masculine  and  feminine  for me  please
@mr. x  can you define  you  and  i
@pandaman  personal pronouns. you directly addresses someone  or vrious people and I refers to oneself. good enough
@mr. x  feminine as in the traditional female qualities and aspects. you know  the natural ones  feminine body features  like breasts  hourglass figure etc  the ones that naturally occur during puberty in a female body  and that turn a girl into a grown woman. and her natural mannerism. the female has always been associated with a more delicate loving behaviour. her strength doesnt lie in the physical   but in her ability to nurture and take care. the female beauty has been revered throughout human history  it is only now that that has been distorted and destroyed by sjws. even in concepts and designs  concept artist illustrator speaking from experience   we are taught to draw and portray females with softer shapes  more pleasing to the human eye  because we are naturally attracted to what is normal  .masculine stands in contrast with the feminine. its harsher  harder  stronger. a male body is more muscular  reverse triangle shape  heroic type.  he is bigger  and much stronger that the female. his hormones also make him act more aggressive and assertive  to protect and fight in a natural environment . just look at any animal documentary really  the feminine and masculine are clearly depicted and distinctive  and since we re also animals  we share the same principles.
@eni  lionesses are still absolute units though. just like sarah connor in terminator 2. I dont think people really care if you just give them a well written character to care about.
@a wanderer from ys  oh I agree. sarah connor is one of my all time favorite characters. she is also so lean. but she still maintains her physical attractiveness. the latest female characters look more like squares than women lol.and yes  most female animals are more aggressive  especially when they have offsprings to protect   but males have more physical strength. lions are stronger than lionesses  but their hierarchy is so that females are the ones hunting  and also teaching cubs to hunt. Imean  predators are going to be predators.
@eni  I dont care much about physical attractiveness  thats mostly personal preference anyway  I want someone who acts her arse off and sells the character. and sometimes that means getting square af like linda hamilton did. definitely preferable to a 60 kg stick figure flaying around imho.that was kinda my point. Imean  lionesses are female yes but how  feminine  are they  if you translate their physical appearance into human form women would look closer to arnold schwarzenegger than marilyn monroe.there s a huge difference between sexual dimorphism and what we deem attractive  or feminine masculine. lionesses are absolute units because thats what catches prey  not because that makes them attractive to the lion  I think its the pheromones actually .t2 sarah connor was an absolute unit because she was a mother. she had no other  feminine traits.  nothing soft or delicate about her  she was very aggressive  assertive  and protective. she tried to murder an entire family and almost succeeded.yet she wasn t masculinized either. because she was written as a person first. she was real  not some cardboard cut-out sprinkled with cgI shite. any personality traits came from who she was  not what. that makes a huge difference when writing characters. and you know  if girls can fight killer robots from the future  boys can cry. because if they dont fight club happens.our ever-changing  often surgery-aided beauty ideals are standards most people can never live up to. its all fake to begin with. in that regard nothing much has changed and I wish people would stop torturing themselves chasing something so fleeting and superficial.and isn t personality more important than looks in the long run anyway  fake boobs and lips aren t a substitute. my complaint isn t that these female characters are too square  if anything they re often not square enough imho   but that there s no personality to fill out whatever shape they have in the first place.I cut actors actresses some slack though because apart from bad writing  it must be a real drag to be acting into a green void doing dialogue with a tennis ball on a stick every day.
or have both. I like a buff female character if she s done well and doesnt drag down feminine women. I also like feminine women or a mix of both. personality and likeability is what s important.
nothing cute or quirky about long expired cheese with fungus growth.
cute and quirky -oh  so thats what that is...
oh no youre all good  I appreciate the support
@melonie mac go boom   by the way  about the brie picture.... its funny how women have instincts for these things  even self-proclaimed  tom-boys  .like  I knew the image was so-so  but my brain could not tell why precisely that was.yet in 5 seconds when you compared it to the k-pop  I thought to myself  oh yeah  thats what was wrong with the picture .
I too am shipping brie and jeremy. it would be a match made in heaven  especially as he s already created a shed in her honor.
thanks so much  I had a blast!
if brie cares about black voices they the movie should be calledms. marvel spectrum and captain marvel  I guess her too
women maybe are bigger part of buyers - but those  experts  are forgetting that women buys different things than men. men buy game or fan-related things more often than women. thats why your audience is mostly men. even if you would look like a librarian - still more men than women would be watching your channel  because you deal with the topic of games and certain movies.9  of nerdrotic s watchers are women  he told this in one of his videos Im a woman and I recently started watching your channel because of tomb raider sorry for baaad english
11 45 thats a big point there. I recall reading how when iron heart was first being shown in comics there were concerns thatshe would cause girls to feel insecure
new sub here  its always good to get a girl s perspective on the craziness going on in the media and entertainment today unfortunately there s few to choose from that are worth listening to. keep up the good work!
I love the blackpink photoshoot part that was definitely the better photo than the other two. all the wokeness got me mostly watching stuff and listening to music from other countries.
youre doing alright  but what do you think of being the exact opposite of who you are  I like your channel because youre a girl who makes sense  first. that actual professionals are out there and trying to create media obsessed with gender is absurd to me  it cant be good business
well done on the big 40k. also brie larson doing brie larson things yet again  what a shocker.
I initially checked out melanie s channel because she s cute. I subscribed and keep watching her videos because she s pretty based and has good takes on things.
good looks attracts the eye but a good personality keeps it.
I relate to you. I was never into the  girl power  stuff or cliques. reminds me of the saying by benjamin franklin   men and women have something in common  they prefer the company of men.
it is great to see you again melonie! great coverage in addition  kitty tail in the first 4 seconds!
in my experience women make an issue of the aestetic of other women much  and I repeat  much more than man.my sisters always complained about how other girls would dress  make up  their appearance  and shit. most of the women I know too. the guys aside the occasional  look at that ass   damn thats a huge rack  have always been a lot more forgiving.
hahaha. Im new to discovering you  and I just made a comment about why I enjoy watching you  saying basically the same thing you just said. I can only speak for myself  but youre intelligent and interesting. you know what youre talking about and I can definitely learn a lot from you about the gaming world. youre beautiful  cute  and have the best facial expressions for reasons Im having trouble putting into words. I wouldn t call all of that a distant second or  just a bonus . I cant help but to be acutely aware while watching. but its sort of like  most people have a balance. when a person is super attractive  their intelligence and ability to be genuinely charming  more often than not  are somewhat dulled. with you  the way I see it  thats not really the case.yeah  you definitely have to be careful when signing with anyone  and that certainly means having an entertainment lawyer look over the contract. some years back  I turned down signing with a company that rhymes with  pony . people will tell you youre crazy when you do stuff like that  but personally  it was the right decision and I ended up being better off for it. there s no way a bunch of others dont see what I see. so  Im pretty confident you ll end up growing exponentially. people just need an opportunity to see and hear you. I just randomly saw you on a show and  well  see above. Im positive Im not alone here. your fans should push for you to be on tim pool s show  and pop culture crisis. you definitely have enough to make that happen. I would love to see that.
brie is the type of woman that wants to be accepted but she tries to be someone she inst. if she lets her guard down and just chills she can be really likable
came here after seeing you on friday night tights  or was it a monday stream .. . in regards to what you say at 8 30 I would admit to be one of those men who finds you attractive but what Im realizing is that watching your videos allows me to relax. I can finally look at an attractive woman on screen without almost constantly seeing her be angry  insulting men and masculinity while proclaiming us the root cause of all evil  womansplaining  spewing feminist rhetoric and generally sending a lot of negative vibes that cause me to somewhat be in a state of tension myself.as far as the photoshoot goes  I dont really get it. there s no unifying theme  its as if they picked 4 random women off the street. I guess racial diversity is the point  as always  which is probably why karen is wearing a blue pantsuit  the two black ladies are in beige cream dresses and ms marvel is in that two-toned attire.
grats on the 40k subs! I think most men are here because you talk about things we like  hail tomboys .and props to the guy from variety. he took a hit he didn t have coming and rolled with it like a pro
personally I can say  that your looks have nothing to do with why I watch. you seems genuine and intelligent and have interesting things to say.  the only time looks might influence is the first time I watched.
wow  youre an incredibly well spoken female   new fan here
God bless all you hot  geeky women defending fandoms across the entertainment world.
guess we can add  troll  to the list of words these people dont know the meaning of.  a troll is someone who posts things to offend or bother others  they re not people who care enough about these things to be bothered themselves  like she was by that reporter .
wow  that money argument makes so much sense. cant believe I hadn t cottoned on to it. thanks for that.  btw  first time on the channel  random recommendation.
based and Christpilled
personally Ive always preferred the company of women myself but Im so damn sick of this woke bs tho.
yes   hates men simply for being men  is going to make a female character unwatchable for me much more than clothing styles  fitness level  or some other notions of attractiveness.
you know what I actually like your voice! this is funny. brie totally got triggered her eyes were like the large marge scene in pee wees big adventure when the guy asked her about captain marvel. mad max brought me here. subbed!
I notice how they muted the interview section on you.  real cute.  not that I wanted to hear  pay me  larson s word vomit  but the principle remains that they muted it like we re not allowed to re-broadcast the aristocrats  words.  I guess thats the lesson they learned from marie  let them eat cake  antoinette - it wasn t the oppression  it was people getting hear her say the thing.
this is the biggest example of crying online she has done in over a year.
ok you pulled me in asking what does blinks have to do with miss marvel  great point their styling sucks but more than that you touched on something Ive been trying to tell people about but none know how the kpop reactor machine works but you should. the way youread the numbers are right on. Ive recently been following movie reactions as well and seen a trend. I believe someone is buying up patreon accounts to influence polls most use polls as a bonus to join  but it just seems funny number 1 thatso many reactors just happen to decide to do the same film in the same week or number 2 that their polls would suggest to react to movies that I know got killed in the ratings. you might want to check into that. oh and yoojung is queen
uglify!!!!!    @13 20      that is the perfect term to describe the marvel group photo.looking at these photos I had very different words come to my mind.kpop girls 	sexy and powerfulmarvel girls 	frump
many congratulations on reaching 40k subs. its all warhammer 40k videos from here on in  there s no escape!
we re really in a terrible  insane period across all forms of media and entertainment.  this current nonsense is either going to self-correct over time or the whole thing will surely collapse.  its unsustainable for all these entities to keep producing content that openly unleashes contempt and hate for the very people they need to financially support what they re making.
I saw that you have more people subscribe to your melonie go boom channel and I just want to say to you that congrats to you for having 40k subscribers to your channel melonie. anyway I am so happy for you. anyway keep it up and keep doing a great work too  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to say that brie larson s eyes widely open bc she is afraid thatshe will never be in captain marvel movie ever again in future. anyway I think thatshe is going to go into karen mode and go after the movie directors to bag them to put her back in the movie so thatshe can enjoy the movie franchise and get paid for doing her role in the movie  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to say that bout brie larson eye widely open scene in the video and I just want to tell you congrats to you on 40 k subscribers on your melonie go boom channel  ok melonie. anyway hope you have had a great day today and hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home and have a good night too melonie.
thanks for sharing this hilarious video captain karen strikes again I love it
freak brie gets on my nerves  hope things are well melonie mac  God bless  also congratulations on 40k
brie looks like their social worker thatstopped by for a quick visit to make sure they aren t harming themselves or anyone else and then they took a selfie together
during that interview I thought brie was going to grab that guy by the face and yell  you are the challenge!!!! . Imean her energy was just that psychotic just like queen alicent.
its not a conspiracy if its happening right in front of our eyes
korean pop culture and korean tv and cinema is leaps and bounds better than anything hollywood is putting out.
great stuff about gow and honestly interesting learning about the analytics of the female player base on it. you notice things like that now a days I d say the most females I run into while gaming is on overwatch curious gonna have to try and look more into it.
personally I only follow you cause I like your opinion. I doubt she ll ever this. I dont care about how the person looks  I dont even watch  I usually listen to youtube while I do other things. so its all about if I appreciate the perspective of the youtuber
thoughtful commentary. well done.
breI larson gives me the strongest amber heard vibes!
the only  marvels  team  that Im going to be watching are the much more enjoyable characters from the upcoming shazam sequel.  brie larson has full-on crazy eyes in that photoshoot.  I was confused about iman vellanI s pink pants and chuck taylors.  if I was still a teenage guy and putting a poster on my wall beside my heather locklear in her red bikinI  it would be that one of blackpink  or about any k-pop or j-pop group.  it doesnt take long from seeing their marketing to realize that they definitely know how to create photogenic images over there.another reason  at least I think  is thatsome of us guys enjoy watching your content because its so refreshing to see a Christian woman who has openly expressed her faith and your opinions reflect that worldview.
jeremy is her biggest fan after all.
thank you so much for the super thanks! I see it this time on my pc  but I do miss them when I check mobile haha. so glad I caught this one  God bless you!
she keeps the lights on in his house
just gonna say this  my wife is my accountant. so my purchasing power goes through her. plus yes she loves to do a lot of the same stuff I do.
only time is allow someone to go full karen  when your little 16 year old chihuahua is injured from an ambush from a larger dog.
moldy french cheese larson creeping into the camera ... made my day
you are attractive  no doubt  but honestly I started  watching your channel because I find your honesty refreshing  you are insightful and funny  and I just enjoy your content. and if I have one problem  its that I keep forgetting to click the thumbs up button on your videos and thats a me problem  and I am getting better at it. love your videos  keep up the good work.
the second picture kind of screams   karen mode activate
your authenticity is infectious!
you are a beautiful woman but you also keep it real and dont change up like most folk I respect that much love to you fasho
16 14 I dont know why but I was expecting her to follow with   thats all Ive got for today. go away now.
I d like to say that you are attractive  but its not the reason I watch.  I love how passionate you are about the things you enjoy and I love your voice.  I actual listen more than watch.  keep that passion going.
thank you for saying  ms marvel s merger thing  at 2 44. I recognized kamala s actor and brie  but I had no idea who the other ladies were until you said that. then I realized one of them must b rambeau s actor. still dunno the other tho.
hard to believe she s a oscar winner
she herself is why no one liked captain marvel. its not the character that is the problem. its the person playing her. you never heard how much people hated black widow because scarlett johansson is a far better liked person and actress.
the huge issue is these corps refuse to look at demographics. sure there s always been ladies that like  geek stuff    and I ll be generous and say thats about 20  of the fandom. yes we have seen more ladies get involved in geekdom. I ll also be generous and say that bumps it up bto about 25 . that means 75  of the fandoms are male. no amount of  changing the formula  will increase that. the simple fact is most ladies just aren t into the geek fandom. change my mind.
lol. she s nuts. Im happy to know we re on her mind.
by now  Im sure she s realized she s shot herself in the foot. just looking at her imdb she s only really appeared in smaller projects and tv shorts since she captain marvel.
I watch melonie mac for that gfuel sweater. and because I like her opinion. her being attractive is just a bonus
anybody remember back on community when she played abed s love interest  she was so sweet and lovable. what the heck happened !
Im kind of done with marvel movies  disney destroyed it  and idk what s going on in general culture anymore. but Im just gonna stick to what I like and what I do. I honestly only saw the k-pop girls on your twitter post  but I didn t see the other one. the second one they dont even look like they are having fun.
I dont know if anyone else remembers it  but there is a short story that is depicting a dystopia  and the thing that made it a dystopia was making everyone match everyone else. if you were pretty  you had to be made ugly. if you were smart  you had to never have your train of thought continue. etc. this is where we are going  and its not a good thing
I think she is being really honest here. lets give credit where it is due instead of dogpiling.
bahahahaha

not really. while brie larson is insufferable as a person  it doesnt help that the writing for captain marvel portrays her as a powerhouse leagues above her peers who can go toe-to-toe with thanos on her own. plus her character s journey was pretty much  I am too awesome  and people hate me for it. Imust unshackle myself from society and embrace my own awesomeness.  she was portrayed as having no sincere character flaws  struggles  or major obstacles to overcome other than accepting how amazing she is.
true tho
@melonie mac go boom
unless youre talking about eastern geek entertainment. the demographic aren t quite as uneven there and Ive always felt this shift in western geek media to attract more girls was partially a response to the way anime and manga managed to attract them. its true though that if you want to sell merch getting the interest of girls and women is great. many male groups in kpop literally survive due to their dedicated female fan base and their purchase power. in one gatcha  despite the primary audiance being men a lot of physical merch revolves around characters popular with female players.
personality goes a long long way towards the way the world acts towards you   attitude and demeanor fills much of the rest. nobody appears to have told me larsen this basic information
I had an agency that wanted to sign me too but it was a collection agency   my wife likes shows like daredevil and the mandalorian thatshow realistically strong women. she cant stand these new shows.
passive aggressive responses are par for the course for this rbf karen.
her mo is  if someone thinks Im not the best person in the world  I ll be a b
karen is a glarin
and shout out to your parents .. you got a damn good head on your shoulders .. your a looker for sure .. but your common sense takes on pop culture is great .. you should or could be modeling .. appreciate you doing youtube on this crazy culture war on entertainment.. thank you  and respects to you
if you look at the kpop picture  they all have the same color pallet just different prominent colors  unlike marvels where they all share the exact same colors with brI off on her own.
well to be fair  the black pink picture of course would get more attention. they are all attractive and dressed sexy. plus  as far as I know they aren t there to represent  the message .
Im blown away that gears of war had a huge female following.  I played rainbow six vegas 2 and noticed there were a lot of female players  at least in my experience .  I loved playing with them because the thinking was so different from myself but they were whoopin a  !.  I remember these two gals who I tried to join up with because playing with them was a blast.
yeah being pretty helps you out but youre also into things that dudes like. thats at least half of it.
eh I remember back in the day watching youtubers like sssniperwolf and girlgonegamer when they both did gaming. it was interesting. I would say what was frustrating and I think maybe what turned some away from both channels was they started drama. and they eventually just stopped doing what they used to do and I think they just kept doing it and doing it. granted maybe one was into the drama more than the other  but that is sort of probably what drove people away. Imean back in the day there was tmartn and rawinstinct if people remember that debacle. the back and forth some say  helped   but like some it might have helped short term  but not in the long run. people come to watch for a particular thing and when you continuously do something that isn t that you aren t getting genuine fans. you are just getting people who like the drama. which in my opinion I didn t care to watch them after awhile myself. drama as interesting of a spectacle that can be  it just is never long lasting.
good for you for not selling out who you are for some extra female subscribers. be real  be true. thats why I respect you
first vid I saw from you was via the quartering.  initial impression was   hey  there s a cute girl with conservative views talking about video games.  Im sold.   obviously youre more than that  which is why Ive stuck around.
keep going beautiful melanie
well  she comes off as ah in full effect.
why would brie be mad at the quartering  jeremy loves her. he built a shed in her honor.
I swear  brie larson is always in full karen mode. her new film is gonna flop and disney will lose a lot of money on it  not that they care because they make movies to just push agendas now  not to make a profit. on another note  I did not follow you because I find you to be super attractive  inside and out   I followed you because I enjoy your content. you managed to keep me for 12 years so you must be doing something right. you are an amazing person and a great friend. your content has quality and the content you do on this channel is very important.
I searched instagram but brie larson is gone  Im a blink too
congrats on 40k subs!
this is the reason I subscribed to you cause I dont care about politics in games or movies I just want a fun experience..... what happened to fun games.
he should buy her a sandwich-making kit too
she s tsundere for that big burly basement sasquatch.
gears did have some female characters like sam anya bernie and the girl in judgement  anya and sam were more involved in the 3rd game of the series  there were alot of men considering its a game about a military fighting enhanced monsters so there would be more men than women on the frontlines of that.
they aren t acknowledging the disconnect between who actually purchases plays their content...versus who rallies behind their identity crap on social media.
the first thing she thinks of when she wakes up is the quartering... because she wakes up next to the quartering.
I dont even know if she was referring to the audience not wanting her back  or disney not wanting her back. still  she s such a unlikable person. she may be a fine actor in other things outside of captain marvel  but I swear nobody would want to be in the same room with her.
youreally hit the nail on the head  like you say  yes you are beautiful  there beautiful females all over the social media but what really got me to subscribe to you is the commen interest  for the most part most male like someone we can connect especially on our intrested in entertainment and you do.
you know  and I was going to mention this  but I was about 17  when the original tomb raider first came out on ps1.  I remember a bunch of my friends  getting into trouble  with their girlfriends for playing tomb raider  because it  was an excuse to look at another  digitalized  girl s @   all day   and I remember the news giving it mixed reviews.  on the one hand  it was praised by the news media for  having more female lead characters in video games   and  men choosing to play as a female protagonist   yes the news media hasn t changed in nearly 25 years.  even the racism bit .  however  it was also criticized for having laura too revealing  and the angle of male attention to this was criticized likewise.  they also postulated that itshould have a higher esrb rating because of that alone.  but yes  the idea that  lara croft was threatening to women s self image  isn t at all a new trope.  it has been with the game since its inception.and yes  I will admit that I am a huge fan  because although you are younger than me  I have a slight crush on you  because youremind me of the best qualities of both of my ex fianc s.  my first ex was a hardcore gamer  we split because of my military career in the early 2000 s  she was half black half thaI   and my second ex who was a blonde with the exact same hair texture and physique as you  but she wasn t a gamer but a gym rat we split a decade ago .  also super thanks are relative to time.  it will appear at the top of your feed for a short time  depending on how much is paid.  I forgot the timetables  but the lowest amount stays on top for only 3 or 4 hours.
the most powerful character in the mcu reduced to a member of an ensemble cast. that will stick it to the trolls!
why has the entertaining industry changed so much this is the reality of demographic change. it will only accelerate
the best movie she ever did was 21 jump street lol
8 35 -  ...some men think Im attractive. I appreciate your modesty.
brie larson also voices the paradigm in fortnite who is a major story related character and the paradigm is supposed to be coming back to the game with an unmasked style that looks like brie larson and just watch how she ll react when people dont use her skin and prefer to stick with dwayne johnson s skin the foundation.
just found your channel youre like a young roseanne barr
everytime I watch one of mel s vids I immediately  go watch an anime  why  dont know
can confirm subbed for the curly hair  content a bonus lol.
I love your hair in this one. your looks are def a perk  but I think the main reason your audience is all male is because many women these days dodge all responsibility and cant handle real talk.
I love blackpink and jisoo is my favorite. I hate thatshes so underrated  while being simultaniously the unnie  like a older sister holding the group together. cool to know you like blackpink  besides being a based woman tho.most k-pop fans are angry leftists  sadly..
I am a woman who watches your channel and I find myself agreeing with you almost 99.999  of the time. I dont wanna say 100  because I haven t watched every video. so I sorta find it insulting how these companies think that woman are so weak and fragile that they are making literally all types of entertainment terrible and woke. I want great content. I used to believe in a lot of the woke stuff and as I got older  I am 26   life experience and educating myself about the world makes all of the woke feminism ideology so dumb. the woke radical feminism feeds off of ignorance  youthfulness  and the compassion that young people have to want to be good people  but not realizing that the movement that they are following is taking advantage of what they dont know and dont understand to have them push ideas that are terrible for society as a whole. there is a lot of putting the concept of happiness on an alter for young women to follow. life isn t about being happy all the time. it is about finding and living out your meaning in life. so we are leading young people down a road to always be disappointed in life because they are brainwashed to think that life is about being happy and being selfish. life is about dealing with suffering and being selflless for others.  in victor frankl s book  man s search for meaning   he talks about how the people who made it through the concentration camps were the people who had found a meaning in their suffering. especially like it is almost always the girls with blue hair with fragile egos and  sorry  the fat acceptance movement that get mad about beautiful woman. as a woman  I love other beautiful woman. I like looking at them  I like seeing them get a platform and attention  and I like that they are even still allowing beautiful people on our screens. like the host has said  they definitely want to try and destroy the concept of collectively recognized beauty..
melonie  Im glad for the nod to k pop. I lived in korea for 5 years and got hooked..
the problem is simply that the photographer of the photo shoot didn t ask them to say cheese.
13 49  gears of war has a massive female following .and this is where so many game developers have lost the plot today. the definition of  inclusivity  is not overtly pandering to all minorities. all it takes is just  dont be a jerk .the gaming industry has really hamstrung itself with the idea that games in the style of gears of war are no longer allowed to be made.
Im referring to the original two especially  which to my knowledge had peak female audience
bahahaha
haha I think its more than  some
ooh good taste with jisoo  she has the most unique voice and she is so beautiful. but she is more introverted and modest so itsadly gets her overlooked a lot. jenny is my fav because I love her attitude and aesthetic so much  but I thousand percent agree with your analysis on jisoo!

while Im not really a fan of black pink  or however you put the name   or of kpop in general  psy and his gangnam style killed it for me despite the rise of the genre   at least they dont try to be shoved to people  unlike the m-she-u...
lol @ that brie larson clip. she went omega.
she s well on her way to the full amber heard meltdown and I cant wait.
color coordinated
they dont understand what average people want. these characters were already popular. women that think for themselves are a no-go for them. they re so scared of actual powerful  strong  sexy women. I used to be a subscriber of strange rebel gaming and then she went off on some tangent about the original lara being sexualized. with people like briana white in the industry its an uphill struggle now.
8 46 I dont know who all these content creator girls who are prettier than you are  melonie. I honestly think youre one of the prettiest girls Ive ever seen. you look like you walked out of a disney movie.
when you just want to chill with the boiz
most women  want to see beautiful  feminine women and strapping  masculine men in their entertainment.most men  want to see beautiful  feminine women and strapping  masculine men in their entertainment.most entertainment    look at how relatable the characters are!  ..I swear  in ten years time  I am going to be walking through the supermarket in my laundry day clothes and get approached to star as thor in the reboot of a remake of a sequel of a prequel. as flattering as that would have been 10 years ago  their sale s pitch will be   when I see you  I almost dont see you. you are remarkably unremarkable  so I am confident that when people see you on the silver screen  they will think   I do not feel insecure at all. this movie is great!   I will thank them  of course  because I do not want to be shot out of a cannon for offending someone far more woke than i. the future is bright  but the light is hellfire.
see  its daddy issues
just want to say kpop is everything america pop isn t.  its actually fun to listen to from both the male and female groups!
oh no! its a picture of brie larson and whoever those other three women are! Im literally shaking
love your hairdo!!!!!
you are the absolute cutest !   -
brie larson has only one gear.. karen!
you ain t no frosky and let s keep it that way. your awesome to view because we love games! too bad no more lara croft...
I remember a time when actors actually did care about the characters they played  they re still around but its a miracle to hear about now. henry cavill as witcher  johnny depp as captain jack sparrow  Christian bale as batman hell the entire cast of Lord of the rings and beyond. in the case of brie being an actor who played a character in a marvel film  let s say she does care beyond her own ego and she was much nicer then she would be more humble say something like.  I would love to return as captain marvel I just hope there are plans in future  and in her case where there might not be a sequel or a return to her character she could talk about how she s ashamed that things didn t work out. all Im saying is its not actually a misunderstanding. there are dozens of examples of actors especially women actors who were genuinely excited to be coming back as a character or if there was no chance of it happening they could regret that or just joke about how bad the movie was they starred in and are glad to not be returning. however they felt about a role is all up to them l. there was no need to glare or be passive aggression towards people asking them questions. no that kind of thing should be given to paparazzi
k-pop photo   hollywood circa 1995.brie and friends photo   hollywood circa 2020.
congrats on 40k and thoughts on the max payne games
wait... wasn t the best friend in cpt marvel the cpt marvel in dr strange s mom
its extra sad cause from what Ive seen iman vellanI is a competent actress with actual love for the mcu and she s bring dragged into this nonsense with those other  goose eggs. sure ms. marvel may not have been good but she seems to personally think what we ve all been thinking.but...stay tuned for updates cause it always seems to end up sad.
she has a kind of ethereal look to her
first!!!
lol. I laugh  I dont cringe. I think her behavior is absolutely hilarious  and I encourage it. watching folks like brie constantly melt down is far more entertaining than anything they actually produce creatively.
she is quite a karen tho
hey way to show blackpink some love!! I love that group
if you want to  own  the haters make good successful movies.
my sister for a long time was better at mortal kombat than I was and she played gears of war alot.
love ya mel. go boom baby.
we should I just change the meme from karen to brie
9 00you say your mind and have integrity for your beliefs. just found your youtube channel. might disagree with some of your views but I respect your criticism of modern media.
well Im glad she s captain marvel  she got the  karen  part of it down.
he s doing his job and asking a question and she seriously responds like that  how entitled can someone even get
yeah I originally gravitated towards you because I found you attractive I stayed because I enjoy the content.
she s seething beetleguese 1 33   lol I hope we get another monster into monster hunter franchise as kareno briena who s a kinda monster who attacks the hunter rather than we attacking her. xd
every time I see a celebrity using the word  trolls  or  haters  I can feel the seething behind the message  if they really didn t care they would just live their life and pander to their own base and people that like them instead of even addressing the people that dont like them. problem is they are so self conceded that they think their work is more important than it really is. look to michael caines comment about jaw 3 being terrible  the guy doesnt give a crap  yes he gives it his all when he works but he just views it as a job not some world defining moment lol
when I see the pic of the marvels  Im like  another phase 4 failure.
honestly  seems like brie larson has been through a lot of something. I forgive her for and pray she finds healing. I know I can act like thatsometimes.
the problem with brie is her damn attitude  captain marvel wasn t a bad movie  but her attitude of  I dont need male fans or male critics   she forgets a man is who gave her the chance of being in movies in the first place  specially captain marvel because kevin could have just as well picked someone else  so I dont understand why she needs to constantly attack the fanbase that is making sure she stays relevant.
cute and smart helps you sell and a gamer is pretty badass lol.
tbch  the whole marvel photoshoot just screams  looking down on you  to me.
im a dude. I started to watch your vids because you have good takes not because youre a girl. its refreshing to hear a women take a stand against this bs. keep up the good commentary. also late to seeing this
well  it helps that you talk to your male audience with utmost respect and do not simply fall for a narrative of  patriarchy bad   especially over hobbies that men traditionally like. no one can deny you are attractive  but its having good character that gave you those views. Imean  I dont know too many people who will knock on  modern  lara croft and then end the vid with Jesus.
trying to appeal to females to expand their fan base is a great thing but not at the expense of alienating men. if their product can appeal to both men and women without disrespecting one or the other then you will most likely have a winning product. why is hollywood in other entertainment media not understand this simple concept.
not only the message but because america has gotten so soft that they trying to hard to cater to everyone so they are forgetting the  fundamentals and main fan base
I find it funny that game publishers have convinced themselves that women dont want to play as an  unattainably  beautiful female character  but most of the male protagonists are still an  unattainable  combination of jacked  top of their field  and or a chick magnet. even if they dont start out that way  they typically have the potential to grow into being a combination of those things. if they didn t  even nerdy neck-beard guys wouldn t want to be like them  and therefore wouldn t like the character.
she needs to stop chasing married men. so shameless.
gears of war huh never thought that would have a huge female audience but hey thats pretty cool Im a gamer myself Ive been gaming since the  90s and early 2000s and I still game at age 37 and Im proud of it
I dont really care about brie larson  but I really like that little video of the cat grabbing the money.  thanks  tony
but Im a blue hair   and not a karen   I know she doesnt mean allll blue hairs
so  its perhaps not surprising that gadot has strong opinions on the topic of feminism.the actress - who had almost given up on her film career when she landed hollywood s most badass female role - believes anyone who is not a feminist is by default sexist. people always ask me   are you a feminist    gadot tells rolling stone  in a new interview out this month. and I find the question surprising  because I think   yes  of course. every woman  every man  everyone should be a feminist. because whoever is not a feminist is a sexist.
15 06 well twitter conservatively is about 70  bot accounts
brie hates being criticized...  she seems like she doesnt care about anything...
you wonder why marvel does not want to make another captain marvel  just look at the way larson behaves   . they want her out.
so what im hearing is  hopper escapess russia but has to dress up as santa claus  catching bodies take my money noowwww
its interesting you mention demographics. Im part of that 90-95  of your viewer demographic so it would ve sucked if you fell into thatsexist trap. my personal reason why is because youre a woman calling this nonsense out. a lot of the men who call this same stuff out can easily be written off a misogynistic sexist. its harder to pull this off on a woman who is calling it out so they have to get a bit more creative and it turns out even more nonsensical. I follow another woman who does similar and calls out censorship in media called vara dark.and a bonus to you being someone I follow is the fact youre a sister in Christ which really made me happy upon finding that out.
it looks like they edited her into the photos. she s not even there.
okay  I hate brie larson as much as the general public hates her  but I feel like youre looking into that first clip a little too hard. I think her response was to be expected from a marvel actor answering a marvel related questions. they dont answer those types of questions. marvel has a strict nda policy about spoilers and most of them would answer those questions fairly similarly. they would always brush away the question and mostly answer either with  id love to if given the chance    maybe no maybe yes  or  I dont know .
what a genuinely interesting take on why the industry panders to women. never considered it. though I definitely wondered why female characters had to be uglified. the  its not realistic  pov doesnt makes sense. the same goes for nearly everything that happens in video games.
didn t notice how much she stuck out in that photo until you pointed it out  that female fashion eye  I guess. maybe she didn t really want to do it or wanted to get it over with quickly lol  idk could be reading too much into it but itseems very brie larson..
its not larson s fault the writing was so bad for her movie.  and  thats the nicest thing that can be said about all of that.  she got millions to play-pretend... thats all that needs to be said about larson.
we follow girls like you and anna tswg who have personalities more than her..
is it a coincidence that all this woke stuff happened when the unjust treatment of african american s in the us started being highlighted  I doubt it  because it happens every ten years or so in this country. its always what about me even though the worst off person in america couldn t compare with the wealthiest person in the majority of countries.
wait... what  lol
please elaborate
your exact reaction to her post with that caption is exactly the response she s looking for. all she did was post that picture with that caption     youre making a 10 minute video on how she s such a karen. you right wingers are so obsessed with her its hilarious all she needs to do is breathe and you guys make a 40 minute video on how she s so unlikable
karen larson... sounds like its meant to be that way
I think in this instance melonie has read this totally wrong as well as some of the comments below  I dont believe larson was being passive aggressive at all  she answered honestly and showed that it was a source of awkwardness for her as she has come to realise how hated she is by some sections of the fandom and that it has actually affected the possibility of her playing a character thatshe probably enjoyed playing and a franchise she was keen to be a part of and that it has slipped away from her now.
haha! kare-glares  dont youremember that cartoon
admitted brie hater here. her pic did nothing. since endgame  mcu has been mostly garbage. Im not even sure whom a couple of the people in the picture are portraying  and I can care less. nothing captain marvel has any interest for me. Im also a huge hulk fanboy. I hate just about everything they ve done. all his great storylines I ll likely never see. thatsaddens me to no end.finally  you pretty much nail yourself. you are pretty self aware. imo you nail your likeability and your audience pretty well.
obviously I noticed you because you are attractive but resisted clicking on your videos at first  I subscribed when I learned you were non-woke with a working brain
photoshoot thing giving me that destiny s child album cover type of vybe
never try to  own  trolls  especially not with fakery. no one is mad about dark skinned people getting attention  they re mad about disrespect. you would think the success of black panther would have put this to rest years ago  and the fact that it didn t  speaks fucking volumes about the real goal. wakanda may not be a real place  but if it was  thats what its citizens would look like. no one argues otherwise.dont want a show full of nothing but white people  adapt a setting that isn t defined by the presence of a shit load of white people. its not hard  asian countries do it all the time. same with bollywood.
personally I think youre just seeing things  came off as a normal answer to me honestly
your videos about larson remind me of people with trump disorder. you just go in looking for anything to hate. Im neutral on her  not some fan  but you and your thread of readers are seeing what they want to see. disney marvel have a history of not giving actors heads up on when and if movies are made  as well as script handouts  to minimize leaks. as sure as she is they didn t give her a contract to do nothing  she is likely telling the truth in that disney hasn t told her any kind of schedule yet. she isn t seething or angry. she answered and answered again while people who hate her are trying to make something out of it just because they hate her. as for the picture saying trolls combust  or however it was put  is obvious. she is calling attention to how she believes the marvel fans who are a bit entitled to how the characters go would be upset by it being all women  no men within the group of current superheroes within that picture. its up to interpretation  but she might have even been bolder and accusing trolls of not liking there only being one white person among those pictures. could be both  but definitely an all female comment. both the idea she s saying something that makes no sense or in the interview you make it out as she s upset  thats not really making her look bad outside of your circle of larson haters who want to believe that. it makes you look either petty and manipulative towards taking things and twisting them into negatives on purpose because you dont like her or you weren t smart enough to keep up with what s going on and actually believe you see those things. one of those things are the truth.  I personally think its the first one. Ive never thought you were stupid.
brie s looks 4 10  after hearing her views 1 10. melonie s looks 6 10  after hearing her views 8 10. be more like mel.
hImelonie I hope your doing well today thank you for sharing your opinion  thoughts on this fabulous chanel takecare melonie
I watched the first video bc youre attractive. I subscribed because of your content and religious views.
congrats on 40k
marvel   disney took everything that we love about our superhero comic books   replaced it with politics.
brie larson just wants to date jeremy
I wasn t happy with her hair in end game but thought she was pretty good actor even though her personality is entitlement
the ones that dont actually buy or watch the content whatever it is and then it bombs and the company loses a ton of money.
reminds me of the time when brie tried to break the internet and nobody gave a shit.
she s showing she s proper angry and unhinged lmao
brie has some weird negative reaction to questions. remember when she did one of those google answers videos  and all of her responses were passive aggressive reactions rather than trying to be informative or insightful.
facts
brie loves quartering.  she doesnt know what youre talking about . lol
for the brie picture only recognized her because she posted it  who are the other ladies
getting to the point where Im just going to cancel every streaming service and stop watching all the shows I loved growing up because they are all shit now
trolls combust.  what am I supposed to be mad about
lol yep I dont really enjoy gaming anymore either. although its because they want the games to be more woke.
1  yes youre cute as hell but more importantly 2  you love gaming and know your shit and do youresearch before commenting on news of the day...how do the npcs not understand that is how you grow your channel as not just a female content creator but any content creator
brie has those crazy eyes
nice
brie needs to take hers meds and go back to her room it ll be fine in the morning
oh no!!!! two pictures of 4 women sitting together!!! Im quaking in my boots! anyway  how re you guys doing
youre a blink too! yay!
49 days til  halloween
yeah your hotness brought me here  the content made me subscribed
I dont think they think women are intimidated by beautiful women  they are intimidated by beautiful women.
who says brI larson cant emote
how is this any different than what chris hemsworth said via ap entertainment chris hemsworth says he ll keep playing thor  until the audience ... or the marvel Gods say  no  we ve had enough.
oh.. she was doing so well past couple of years.. this does further prove it appears to be outrage marketing.
if youre threatened by a cartoon you need mental help...
now I have that halloweenlll jingle stuck in my head.
chris hemsworth didn t act passive aggressive like brie did
if you want to own the trolls  put out a good product.
half the women here in seattle are like this.  she could easily live 15 minutes away from me  and she wouldn t seem any stranger than the bulk of women here.
lol  the title...
gal gadot gets real   if you aren t feminist  youre sexist  by joanna c. valenteaug 28  2017
they aren t trying to appeal to women but feminists.
looks like a target add
boom!!
I used shrug it off when watching the video  you can she s ticked. marvel replaced her title and added a crutches in the form of kamala and monica
bots get them big tweet likes but the sales show the truth.
8 47 you are the prettiest
she d be a great michael jackson!
they are trying to appease people that dont buy the products. woke dont sell
I heard black pinks music once. they re good.
when japanese girls look better than you
what would amber heard do
yes you are attractive  but more than that is you have a lot of the same views as guys. and you know how to discuss topics without putting us to sleep.
the fans never wanted her in the role of captain marvel. shout out to the quatering.

brie desperately needs a sandwich.
jeez she cant go without 30 seconds saying something stupid.
she might as well have repeated   is that a personal attack or something   what a unlikable person.
who told you that you aren t as pretty as the other girls
most people that go see the marvel s are going to see how bad they ruin monica rambeau the best and most loved captain marvel in the comics.
she puts the reeeee in brie. she s so triggered!
lara croft @11 32
her only okish work has been envy addams in scott pilgrim to say the least.
I just want to watch for entertainment.is that too much to ask
every time cheese larson  too easy   low-hanging fruit of a joke   heh heh  opens her mouth  pr experts all over the world slap their foreheads and groan.
in regards to being a k-pop fan  have you seen the k da videos   if not  I recommend starting with  popstars .
mel  everybody  if youre reading this comment  all of you are the true celebrities thatspread truth bombs   facts  all of you are the best of the best  all of you are the real heroes   heroines of pop culture that continues fighting for the entertainment industry   exposing the corruption  the real warriors of escapism   entertainment  not these woke activists  not these woke  celebrities  not these fake fans  not these fake writers  not these fake artists  not these fake game journos  not these fake game critics  not these fake gamer girls  not these fake geek girls  not these spineless cowards like anita sarkeesian  zoe quinn  brianna wu  jack thompson  jonathan mcintosh  sam maggs  zombiunicorn  froskurinn  gail simone  tom taylor  tom king  the list is endless
how did disney allow woke culture to kill the marvel brand   .
you and I have almost the same thumbnail. I thought it was my vid for a sec.
did yall know she hulk is played by a dude
she s a genuinely mean person but her feminism was sleeping her way to an oscar.
whaaa...  me watch you b c youre pretty   remove the dagger from my heart! just kidding  you are def very pretty. keep rocking!
brie karen larson
she s not in the ms marvel movie at all
where s your Bible quotes
look at those crazy eyes
by the way  I wouldn t say there are girls prettier than you. I think youre just as attractive. not trying to sound like some creep trying to come on to you  thats just my personal opinion.
yes Ive kept up with k da since the beginning  d
keep up the awesome work lady.
you dont need to watch the d  shows. especially the marvel stuff. aside from what if  most of its throwaway shows
there are plenty of other girl nerds out there doing videos but how many of them are wearing the armor of God and standing against the burning woke legion  keep standing.
its all larry fink s fault.
the photoshoot looks like the rings of power kinda. larson is just creepy
esg scores the great reset
I think we can guess what ll happen with marvels or the marvels or captain marvel 2... whatever they choose to call it. because of what s happening right now. it ll be mid. fans will give all kinds of reasons why they dont like it or wont watch it. disney marvel will pull out the racism misogynist shield again.
us guys call that  crazy eyes.   any woman making that face with her eyes that wide open is fucking crazy.
captain twatwaffle is at it again with the psychotic feminist crazy ass facial expressions and yes the karen glares she s doing its cringe and unprofessional behavior coming from her.
we cant hear what you hear!
women drive or influence 70-80  purchases  well  that clarifies where the miscalculation by hollywood happened and what s really behind the charade of virtue signaling.
gal gadot  either youre a feminist or youre a sexist wonder woman herself would know. by sarah rensepublished  aug 24  2017
she looks photoshopped into that
oh damn she s a girl! lol no serious Im over the mcu noty
is it me or tats a tiny mouse cursor
look at dem crazy eyes
how awful would a woke super hero movie be  brie larson screening at men and blaming them for all the problems in the world
does she has some kind of nervous disorder  she cant seem to talk and move normally.
the karen-sue in a suit appeals to zero males...good luck with that ad campaign.
I think he was the one being a little rude as well.
you are hot but I do love your commentary. keep up the awesome content.
@melonie mac go boom      brie larson goes karen again    thatsuggests she actually stopped doing that at some point...
I could say something about the white supremacy being demonstrated by brie if I were made out of triggers...
bree just has to deal with the fact thatshe ruined the captain marvel franchise in the very first movie. I think they should have immediately recast her after the first movie but marvel s gonna do down with the ship.
you look so warm and cozy. she s clearly knows thatshe is being phased out in favor of rambeau and kamala khan. how much of the money do you actually get from the super thanks I wonder
nah no cap on some completely simp vibes. idec. you can go on and on all you want. I ll watch every minute. fr fr.
that one girl in the corner is so far back thatshe becomes apart of the background. you cant even really see her. terrible photo.
keep her away from samus aran. I dont want her lara crofting my samus aran
who is in either picture
it looks like she was photoshop-ed in.
aye you smart. subs
16 58 cat
maybe they should try producing a good product instead of propaganda. and yep  you speak guy pretty well for a girl.
captain marvel ous  forehead. those two pictures are all forehead lol.
I cant stand brie.
I had no idea gow appealed to women  how   I cant think of a more bro-y game lol.
hold up  melonie is a girl !   cue the scene from mulan
I dont like k pop but they sure look more attractive then brie larson
she seems like a total sociopath here  especially since this is a televised interview  this is embarrassingly bad  as well as being incredibly ignorant.
exposed mitzy s say blah blah blah wekImekI fighting
this strange obsession some people here on youtube have with brie larson is still going strong I see.
brie larson pretends to be  woke as fuck  and then creates and peddles nfts. its like she knows its an act and public persona.
why are brie s hands so large
I have personal beef with brie because she genuinely disgusts me her attitude and what she said degrading shirley temple. so Imake memes clowning her whenever she s trending.
even in an interview this woman cant act. good grief
deranged charlie manson eyes is a frequent side effect of stage 9 feminism.
laugh at that last post but please understand that tupac was the person that made madonna an activist in the 90s   she signed up to suck him off and apparently gained some awareness somewhere along the way. so jump to this generation.... there has to be a reason brie would say sam jackson is her best friend      what you think
nice vid. shes so toxic apparently its not just dceu with issues. mcu doesnt know what to do with her haha she s so mad!
what is with all women and especially young girls wearing suits and men clothing nowadays
that photoshoot looks fake. they are all wearing white. she is in black. im calling it. photoshop! she was not there!
the last of us 2
that photo gives you the harvey weinstein look hmmm. hollywood photo shoot .. yeah bout that   hmmm   just hmmm. smfh
I always had issue with the newer gears of war games when they added kate. I couldn t even finish gears 5 cause I just found her way to winy and annoying. its not thatshe is a female character either  I loved the original games cause it was so testosterone heavy it was funny but awesome. centering a game around a girl out of no where felt jarring and felt like they were only doing it just for the sake of it. gears of war used to be my favourite franchise to but now its girl power and takes itself say to seriously. sorry for my rant lol
I am a member because you have a female geeks perspective  you know what your talking about and you highlight other problems  that as a guy with a mans critique  I will probably miss. not saying your not cute but thats not what Im here for.
brie does not come off as likable.   she s not as dis-likable as the g4 creature ...but still how does either one have a job for gawd s sake.
no Bible verse
never liked brie. never will.
if brie larson is in it  I wont be watching.
the topics are the reason you have a bigger male audience.your pretty too  but its not the reason I follow you.
and brie wonders why nobody likes her  and why they say she s an unlikable angry  female dog
in the pictures why did they put the black women in the back
good point
one question  brie being a white women shouldn t she have given up her seat in front to one of the woc
another pick me any sjw content creator profiting off of negativity. goodon you for making money off the grift!
brie larson is the most overly sensitive n obnoxious  she s full with hate..even her face constantly looks like she s angry or annoyed with something
the insanity of the woke
ur mic is too loud  pls turn down   turn up video... pls dont suddenly raise voice sharply.... its unpleasant listening carefully to to a very very quiet video...then ur rly loud...pls be considerate
@melonie mac go boomlarson is a man.watch the trans files.
cringe worthyits hard to watch
brie larson being boring.  oooooooohhhh noooo! ... wait what   I think the internet needs to notice you in order to come close to breaking it.
is it me or did they shove the black people at the back and the whiter the actresses got the further forward they are    is anyone else seeing this from the supposed  woke  media. is this not kinda racist in a way
so  is blackpink any good
the marvels is also gonna flop. big time
nobody likes a hunk of long expired cheese with mold growing out it.
I d like to get an explanation for why underworld is one of my favorite movies if Im such a bigoted misogynist.
I dont hate brie larson. I hate carol danvers  the fictional character. captain marvel has always been a weak comic character. too much power  no weaknesses  and a cocky attitude to-boot.
terrible photo in every way.
real question  is brie larsen a lesbian or bI or something
I haven t watched 34 seconds of it yet and Im already hearing   a bunch of stupid stuff from marvel.  why do you hate so much ! !
queef larson was the downfall of marvel.
thats boomer talk. gross.
bwah
she is woke-ing wrong
I freaking love them personally lol. their music is great  and their music videos are stunning. Im obsessed with jennie and lisa. when I need a break from my metal and rock music I just listen to blackpink  p
@melonie mac go boom  it was the tomb raider outfit in kill this love Im guessing they are the best at what they do no doubt
Im sorry I know you have a point  but youre grasping at straws with the outfits in the photo shoot . you must have tons of guy fans.
I wish brie larson was a better actress
to quote the genie from the ducktales movie   hey  these are wishes  not miracles.
@Christopher trevino  very true.
