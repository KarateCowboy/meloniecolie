great thing about the souls franchise is they harken back to a time when there was a certain mystery in games. this franchise has created a community who is willing to help each other and enjoy discussing the franchise.the only hostility is to those who want to change something that works great.
loving anything whether you suck at it  if that comes in the form of gaming  baking  skiing  or what have you is probably the purest form of joy because it just shows the humility and passion you have for said activity and its purely based on fun
congrats on 25k.  I think that the  classically trained  t-shirt with a nintendo controller applies here.  games in general have progressively gotten easier since my childhood.  most of those early nintendo games were based off all arcade cabinets that were based on being difficult to take more quarters from you. bragging rights were earned when you were finally able to beat a game.
interesting. generally speaking  I like easier games. my job is pretty stressful  and when I play I just want to relax. I also dont worry about trophies or achievements because to me it is just a game anyway. this is one of the reasons I like new tomb raider and uncharted  and why in rdr2 I usually just hunt and fish.thatsaid  I was replaying jedI  fallen order recently  and was getting seriously annoyed by how itstarted trying to give hints if you took like two seconds to figure it out. I also went back to morrowind a while back and was struck by how much better the experience was than skyrim  even if skyrim had way better graphics and combat. so perhaps I need to reevaluate.
push forward to win! - the best thing about old tomb raider was reading your environment and testing out your paths with no uI to help and fully immerse you... now its more like run to the objective marker and press a few buttons during an animated cut scene.
the problem is the gaming industry having so much investment in california  the cesspit of humanity.
when modern games force you to walk and talk I literally cant take it Im so impatient  I just wanna go I love your daily discussions and observations  even if I fall behind on the daily uploads I always catch up watching them all! I d love to see you as a guest on the you are here channel to hear more from you!
one of the biggest downsides to lara in the early classic games imo was how little dialogue she got. adding up all the times she talks between 1 and 3 could be missed during a moderate pee break. I liked how legend gave lara much more legroom for banter and quips  exploring how fierce  fearless and witty she is with all the banter she shared with zip and alistor.
and Im just over here like  cant we have a game with an enjoyable story  oldschool difficulty no hand holding  and fancy aaa cut scenes great graphics    none of these things are mutually exclusive  but so many devs treat them like a pie chart instead of a buffet.
I really love your videos and the message you bring even though we are very different people.  I am a liberal who does not believe in God with a capital g.  despite our differences I agree 100  with your views on wokeism.  I think their message is basically neo-mccarthyism with an even more dangerous reach. I put them in the same sad camp as scientologists and they attack their perceived enemies exactly the same way.     I was security at a bar and a bartender for a total of more than fifteen years. one of my major responsibilities was keeping an eye out for predatory males in both roles.  I laugh every time you talk about feeling safer around  toxic  masculinity than woke male feminists because you could not be more correct. I learned quickly who the real male predators were.  I even like your discussion of Bible passages. I find it more a genuine act of your belief system than an attack on mine.  please keep doing what you do in this channel cause it is so important and know that you have friends and allies in areas you might not think you do.   thanks for the videos
so happy melonie is still making content.  keep up the great work
congrats melonie on 25k subs! I agree with you totally on bringing back the difficulty factors. those mind building puzzles are important for the younger crowd.
I was so focused on working while listening to you. then you mentioned the husband thing and took me out of it. lol. elden ring was what I wanted ds1 to be. all I wanted was a jump button. I said the verticality of dragon s dogma will make this better and finally its here.
watching you stream elden ring was great. I normally dont watch people stream games but I gotta honestly say it was really fun. after watching you play  it made me like elden ring when more because almost every choice you made was different than my first go through but you still got enjoyment. it just shows another reason why elden ring is better than guided participation trophy games. there s limitless ways to play it and instead of being guided at every corner  you make your own path.
the souls series is pretty competitive. there is an entire pvp scene where you create builds and challenge others around a certain level perimeter. Im already working on a pvp build to see if I can compete on the same level I did in ds3.
Im catching up from yesterday! we re the same age and its the challenge and story that I loved in games growing up. there was those games where you d spend hours trying to figure out a puzzle or beat a boss that was so satisfying when you succeeded. no participation trophies were awarded by my mom!
yes! 25k..you deserve what you earn ma am. absolutely agree about modern gaming  they ve broken the prime directive - the journey  earning the destination. black   gold since  89..dark times ahead fyi
congrats on 25k subscribers  let s go boom squad!!!!
elden ring is my best friend s first souls game. he got mad after repeatedly dying to margit and uninstalled the game. he reinstalled it the next day and gave it another go  after starting a new save file. he just beat margit yesterday and said he s never felt so accomplished with a game or had this much fun since the n64 days. I told him that feeling of accomplishment is a large part of what keeps bringing us fans back to these games and why we wont shut up about how great souls games are.  praisethesun   t
I loved the challenge of games. Ive noticed quite a lot that the gamers youre talking about came in droves and influenced games to be easier. now I just mindlessly burn through games and have to go for all the trophies and achievements just to make the game somewhat challenging.
why would any one care about how easy or hard a single player game is  its not pvp. its pve. Im sick of people wanting the element of pvp and hard as heck in games. there is a reason why they re niche games. because they are for a small group of people.always have been always will be.
old survival horror the puzzles were so awesome.
@evacody124  are you calling eldon ring niche  because sales for that game was anything hut niche
not just easier. more forgettable too. throw away experiences instead of memorable  challenging games.
@azu  a bit of a stretch there  ganon is oot was insanely easy but the battle was still epic  I still remember a lot of bowser battles  kirby games leave quite an impact.
most triple a games these days lacks respect for the player  sense of self-discovery is pretty underrated for games. not saying old games were perfect or anything  but it do be like that. indie games have the right balance of old game charms and modern day conveniences  I recommend trying them.

resident evil 3 fixed this issue  which more games would do it. you can skip cutscenes and ingame dialogue  and you have to basically confirm itso it doesnt happen by accident.
because you cant appreciate the graphics if the game doesnt stop you in your tracks and force you through a hand-holdy  gameplay-cutscene . because I sure as heck didn t stop in my tracks to admire the beauty of the underground cities of elden ring and their starry fake sky ceiling.
@3 slices senpai  I disagree. I love appreciating great graphics while I die over and over.also  the souls-like genre isn t what I would consider  oldschool difficulty with no hand holding   they re just insanely difficult. there is a line between  so hard you ll be outrageously aggravated every time you play  unless youre some kind of masochist   and  here s a golden trail of obviousness  enjoy the 50 hour railroad   when devs find that line is when we get what I consider truly great games.
@Christopher duncan  sorry  I guess I didn t convey that I was being sarcastic throughout my reply
@3 slices senpai  no thats on me  Ive always been terrible at discerning sarcasm... especially in text... and even more especially on topics where people say some really off the wall shit completely unironically.
what story  elden ring like every other fromsoft game had the worst story telling ever put into an rpg. the sheep that blindly say its the best have never played an rpg.you can say you have but youreally never have.
@3 slices senpai   Im sure you would be a hoot as. d d dungeon master. you  so you enter the land and start fighting.group  why you  because I said so what do you want a story with your rpg group  yes thats kind of the point all rpgs take the ideas from Lord of the rings and other fantasy tales and put them in game form. with out the story it just another action adventure platform game where you get the message sorry mario the princess is in another castle line.
@evacody124  jrpgs and fighting games are my favorite videogame genres  so I understand your complaints about the fromsoft games  way of storytelling  since its so obtuse and vague.but thats kind of the point. the souls games dont have the player character in the role of the destined hero from the get-go. if we discount the wolf in sekiro  youre just a random joe thats like all the other undead tarnished hunters. being put into the world with a vague explanation is not because the devs were lazy and didn t want to tell you the story  but because they want you to make your own destiny and figure it out yourself by the amount you want to know  by reading item descriptions  exhausting npc dialogue and figuring out their riddles  and paying attention to the architecture. for example  the radagon marika duality in elden ring. throughout the game  you start putting this demiGod family tree together between marika  radagon  Godfrey  renalla  rannI and the other bosses  yet radagon is always involved in mystery. the turtle pope says that he once had a statue made of him  but had it destroyed because the sculptor knew his secret. then you do the golden order ending sidequest and you discover via a secret message that radagon and marika are the same person  that they are an hermaphrodite  ranma 1 2 gender switching God that married itself and two other people of opposite genders. and then you go to the beginning cutscene and notice that  as marika destroys the elden ring  she suddenly reaches out for it in a protecting motion and figure out that that was radagon trying to undo her his mistake.fromsoft games  story just aren t spoonfed to you  you have to go and discover it yourself  even if its confusing as frick. go watch a vaatividya lore video if youre curious.
I really liked your comment. this is a nice comment   .

@bahamut  hey now .. he s a mac boomer
first time playing any souls style game  I played elden ring for thr first time yesterday and I thought it was fun  I died a few times but it isn t that hard  its difficult at times but that makes it more fun and gives you a feeling of accomplishment.also all the memes in the game are hilarious
two minutes   aloy in hfw was yelling out puzzle solutions before I d even had time to notice that there was a puzzle. going from that game directly to elden ring was almost jarring  and made me really appreciate what a treasure fromsoft is in this age where most devs think that if the player has to use their brain for even a millisecond  their entire game has failed.
grats on the 25k. I avoided souls games  because they are intimidating to me  but I am gonna play elden ring. itseems to me this game is to good not to have played it. Ive played dying light 2 and what bothered me the most was the handholding in that game. and like with similar games those yellot thing all over the world to indicate  you should parkour here are annoying me allot. thatsaid I do enjoy those easier games  because I am a hardcore competitive gamer. I always have one main game I am fully engaged in and know everthing about  current meta s  builds etc.  when I am not playing that game  Imostly wanna relax. those handholding games help with that. but everyone is allowed to have their own opinion and style of play. I do agree over the years  have been gaming for about 20 years now  got allot less  try-hard   and that has been bugging me.
elden ring reminds me of the old school might and magic titles. open world  didn t hold your hand  made you think  trial and error. we need more games like this.
hey mel. I remember back in the day of everquest when you had the same feeling as elder ring. it was an unforgiving game. if you died  you had to run back and hope you didn t die again and then loot your corpse to get all your gear. it also had very dark areas without a torch and if you were human good luck. furthermore  you had to work on skills like sense heading to know your way n  s  e and w. swimming had to be trained  spells skill had to be worked so spells didn t fizzle. what this all amounts to is you felt powerful each time you leveled  and you felt a sense of accomplishment because it wasn t easy. elden ring feels the same way. I dont mind the good story with quest line but realistically what is wrong with being like d d where you would visit and have to listen to people and take notes of what things needed done  quests . it makes it more real. too many games people dont even read or listen to npc on quests..they just click through and do whatever. yeah  they may glace over it  but really they just dont really care enough and just want levels. people have lost the joy of adventuring and taking time to learn. exploring and adventuring. d d you could chose to help or not to help...it all depended on what your characters wanted to do. I like this because it makes you critically think..which is what people miss and need now.
elden rings is not for me either  here s why I too love multiplayer games like my number one fav is division 2 its hard a lot of times and I play with other players but Ive watched youtubers play elden rings and the graphics and open world are amazing  I also love single player like resident evil remakes  far cry 2 through primal  I just love playing with other people. and another game series I like is borderlands 1 2 3 prequel. love your content keep em coming and congrats on the 25k subs.
mel  I hope you see this!!great video! its dumb how people get so twisted over this game.I watched your past two streams for the game. I was trying to yell for your attention last night in the playback  but apparently it didn t work. Im a samuraI  level 90 or so with over 40 hours put in. we seem to play similarly. you about gave me a panic attack when you almost changed out your ash of war on your katana to thatstomp. whatever you do   I highly recommend that you do not change your ash of war on that katana from its default sheathe. that is arguably one of the best ones for that build and once you swap them you cannot get them back unless youre lucky and find it in the wild.Ive done a lot of research on samuraI builds and thatseems to be the global consensus when youre using the base katana. keep sheathe. its the move you do holding l2 and pressing r1 r2 to do the slash. also  the bow you have  hold l2 to activate its special shot  its more powerful  but slower  than the default.also  pump xp into vigor  mind  endurance  dexterity  not strength  and intellect. the reason I say intellect is because there are powerful katanas that are imbued with magic. one of the best ones is moonveil. it requires level 23 intellect . strength is only good if you want heavy weapons or armor. but if you are playing a samuraI  dexterity is sufficient and where all your power damage comes from and where katana scales the best.I hope that helps! I now feel less anxious getting that out to you. see you on your next stream. hopefully I ll make it to the live one this time.
anything from software is worthwhile for me. elden ring was pretty challenging the open world seamlessly fit in with this type of game. and Im masochistic I guess with these titles I ll cuss like a sailor but always come back for more lol. I put over 200 hours into my first playthrough in elden ring
I really love the challenge the fromsoftware games have reminds me of the the days when games were hard
let me first say congratulations on your subscriber count. thats awesome. the next thing I want to say is this. as far as I cantell the gaming industry is only going to get worse as far as these participation games are concerned. they want to appeal to a broader audience  they want to get as many people buying their games as humanly possible. at the end of the day its all about money. I believe that the dark souls franchise and elden ring are the exceptions to this rule. but the overwhelming majority of games nowadays and possibly in the future are going to be more story driven. I could be wrong  but thats just what I observe. I hope I am wrong.
personally I prefer a game that challenges me. if you make a game where its handed to you on a silver platter I ll go watch a movie. I like a game that I have options  puzzles  difficult quests and appropriately awesome rewards. something that gives me a sense of accomplishment once Ive completed it and re-playability as well. try it with a different character  different abilities  different classes and such. make it interesting and challenging and I ll come back for more.
congratulations on 25k! love your content.  was going to watch a few of your videos to see if they are for me but then you started reading a Bible verse and I subbed immediately.   keep up the fantastic content.
I found your channel through your stream with the critical drinker on tomb raider. great stuff so far. I just hate it when game developers in recent years have dumbed down games. however I am a bit on the fence on elden ring. I love a game with a challenge  but also a game with a great story and substance  like dragon age  origins  mass effect trilogy  and the old baldur s gate and icewind dale games  on higher difficulties. I dont normally like open world games  too much aimless walking   however botw opened my eyes to what open world games can do. would yourecommend elden ring considering this thank you for great content and keep up the good work.
I want the game to be challenging w o not spending hours trying to figure out where to go I like knowing the next objective
a decade ago I was a software qa tester for a studio under a very large publisher  for over 4 years. as soon as wow put in the highlighted path to your next quest objective I called it.  the player would never be asked or required  to put in any effort or build any skill to play a  competitive  game.when I was a player did I hate grinding out xp  or gold  or having to hunt down a npc with only cryptic directions to guide me  absolutely ... but I understand now that it all served a purpose. no one has the balls to tell the players to just deal with it. instead they cater to the lowest common denominator and make a game for children.I grew up playing fps s and for a long time mmo s were my life. if the end reward is worth it  the effort wont be looked as wasted time.  plus I still consider the people I spent those nights grinding with  as my friends. even though I have never seen them in person
gratz on 25.3k melonie you are a breathe of fresh air
I think the reaction to elden ring and other from soft games is rather telling. a healthy game industry should have a multitude of games that cater to the various niches  including inflinchingly difficult ones like elden ring. however every time a game like elden ring comes out the industry throws a fit. the gaming industry is sick.
youre awesome  melonie. keep up the excellent work.
booooom girl!!!super congratulations on the 25k!I always smile when your notification pops up
I like your message here and it needs to be said. I think that what we are seeing is some of the outgrowth of  open worlds  in gaming ... simply because its so easy to end up down a path and loose site of your objective. so what happens is you need a little bit of a nudge in the right direction. the problem is its gone form a nudge to almost putting it back on rails and diluting the overall experience. keep calling it out the more that it is said the better chance the message reaches the right ears and the trends in game design changes. even if you are getting some pushback its worth it.
elden ring is nothing like the old might and magic titles. just because its open world doesnt mean its instantly similar.
its a shame all the far cry games have been bland reskins after 3
isn t there a grace guidance in elden ring
because the niche group of people that like dark soul like games want it every where in games. you are trying to make rpgs into sports and fighting games. it needs to stop.
I love a challenging game especially ones where you can get around an obstacle in multiple ways  some games these days seem more like an interactive movie  I find this ironic cuz these dont get flamed for no challenge the way souls gets flamed for no movie mode
what I love about mac s videos is that I like  some  of the games she refers to  detroit  becoming human and  survivor  tomb raider - story games  but I 100  agree with what she s saying.after all  I quite often died double digits on a single mission on me3 insanity difficulty. loved it.
Im so happy that you mentioned dmc ! I bounced off from ds  not really got me into because of slow combat. dmc in harder difficulties kicks your ass a lot but combat is still fun and overcoming difficulties with a style brings me satisfaction. games are now so generic and just not fun to play.if you search for hard game with fun combat  try sifu. congrats 25k mel !
I haven t gotten into souls yet  but a lot of my favorite games lately have been difficult action games. Ive started to really appreciate difficulty in the games I play ever since metroid dread came out  and Ive been exploring the hard modes in games I currently have and Ive been having a blast. so this easy mode movement to me has felt more demeaning than anything else. also  I definitely plan on getting into the souls games soon  I just have a list of games to get through.
Im not a fan of the souls games  but so far Im enjoying elden ring a lot. Im horrible at it! but I love the exploration and the world. it real has kept me interested and maybe at some point I ll get better at it  p
proud to be a boomer just for you mel
hey cool  Ive just noticed. its the 90 s again! once again I find myself in an stigmatised gaming subculture.I ll take it. gaming carried me through all of that grief as a kid  and as an adult  its water off a ducks back. I get awesome games out of it that I can immerse myself in until the fallout dies off  so what canthey do to us  praise the from!
the fun  challenges and achievements are what games are all about
what raised the open world gaming bar for me was elder scrolls online. no hand holding at all  however the cut scenes in the main quests can be a bit longer than you d like. but once main quests are finished you wont have anything to stop your gaming experience.
just subbed yesterday so I ll add my 2 cents lol. my issue with hard games and older style games is time. elden ring looks great and its hard and I wouldn t mind playing it. but time. I work full time and I work overtime plus I just finished renovating a house  took 2 saturdays off in 8 months. so the little bit of time I put in I want to make more than a smidge of progress. I cant devote an entire saturday to playing and make alot of progress. so games changed over time I think as a result of busier lifestyles. younger people like me grew up to have a life with family and friends and etc. I used to live with a roommate and pass out on the couch playing morrowind and wake up and keep going. crap job and few friends I had all the time in the world to play. now that Im at a different stage I appreciate quicker easier games that I dont have to spend more time on. not that by any means its bad or that I dont like those games I simply cant persue them as much as I would desire to. anyways keep it up.  what are your tattoos of
I really like the long cinematic cut scenes in the open world rpgs. what about a game like detroit become human which is basically a movie that you control
the most challenge I find with games nowadays is because of the unresponsive controls. many fast paced games simply fail to keep up with you as you press a button and nothing happens. also death because of getting stuck in scenery happens in almost every game. super frustrating.
I have to agree with how easier games have become over the years as opposed to how difficult they used to be! honestly when I first played tomb raider back in the 90 s  I felt that the controls were insanely difficult  and it turned me off from it at the time! however when I started playing games like resident evil for the first time  I really grew invested with the games  despite the tank controls having a steep learning curve  and like you explained in the video  og tomb raider is the exact same way! newcomers to re or tomb raider may be turned off from the originals  and indeed I have met many folks who absolutely did not like the original style of resident evil after being exposed for the first time to 4  or even the remake of 2 3 or even 7 and village! as with the original resident evil trilogy  I always prefer to play them with the d pad as opposed to using the dual shock  because that was how I learned to play those games! your point on og tomb raider  makes me tempted to take another crack at the earlier series! I too felt that legend felt very different from the earlier games that I tried  but I did enjoy it overall! as for the reboot trilogy  I enjoyed them for what they were  but have to agree that was not lara croft  and I especially felt that when I played the next two games! I really enjoy listening to your take on the gaming community  and am looking forward to new content! you ve been subbed!
I honestly love eldern ring I love that game style but I also love rpgs with great story s masss effect and resident evil old and new are my favorite games!
to be honest  once you get through the first handful of hours  I think majority of people should find elden ring an easily enjoyable experience.as long as youre not one of those people who get hung up on not dying at all. the map is big enough for people to venture out if they get stuck with a tougher area  you can always go to a different spot to progress level up.9 10 if he s into competitive multiplayer  does he just quit if he has a bad night with horrendous k d  its the same thing in elden ring  if something isn t working for you  you try something else  you observe your enemies and formulate a strategy accordingly. so what s the difference
I love how melonie already knew the gang was gonna pull up 11 48
watched cuz of gaming  subscribed cuz of scriptural talk at the end.  keep it going!
melonie hitting it out of the park once again.
congrats melonie for accomplishment you earned it.I see you your going to get many more.Im very big steelers fanaswell.I really enjoyed seeing you playing your game last night. hey melonie sincebig ben has left steeler nation ! what s your choice of qb would you likesee lead the team this year   not masonrudolph lol.takecare melonie
in my life Ive learned this about video games and most things in life.  I strive for a 75  success rate.  thats how you grow.  if you never fail at what youre trying you aren t trying difficult enough things.
strongly recommend bloodborne if you have a ps4 5  Im also like you and didn t really vibe with dark souls  slow combat  although I still play most of them halfway into the games  and pretty much beat ds3  but bloodborne is such a joy to play combat-wise. of course the lore is great too.
dude pick up ds3.  it cheap now and such a great place to start
I didn t realize I was going to start something  lol.  congrats on 25k! the last game Ive purchased was fallout 4. I used to play pubg  but I got tired of funding china s takeover of central america.
I love the witcher 3 and I was trying to remember how their hud was set up. launched it today and it wasn t too bad but I did see where you canturn sections of it on and off to have as much or as little as you want. so thats nice. but I like how er does it. er is addicting. I cant stop playing. great takes! keep up the great content! haters are going to hate no matter what. and I wonder how many of those that hate on this game have really ever played it at all or just jumping on the  crap on it  bandwagon  my feeling they re projecting and they haven t place one second of the game nor even know what its all about truly.
botw actually made bokoglins deadly the 1st few encounters since they can body you and metroid dread reminded ppl that metroid was hard at 1st  before the prime series
personally Im not a huge fan of overly difficult games  but I do like some spiciness   a challenge. however  at my age I just dont have the time or patience to grind through a ridiculously hard difficulty curve for the most part like I used to in the 90s 00s. nor do I like games that hold your hand. there s a fine line of difficulty   progression that a lot of games miss the mark on. I feel like gow 18  fallen order    witcher 3 hit that mark pretty well  rdr2 also.the only soulslike that Ive played so far has been nioh cause ds sb was kinda offputting to me  maybe partly because of the stigma  partly because of the slow looking combat. nioh was tight af  incredibly responsive  a more palatable environment lore imo. I literally had to buy a new controller for it because the controls were so tight responsive that I realized mine had stick drift   button issues that weren t present in other titles. I never beat the game but I had a blast with it getting pretty far into the first playthru  I tried to get a few buddies into it but they weren t interested so mine kinda fell off. that and other games came out shortly after.
I dont need games to be super easy but for me its all about keeping things moving along. I have a limited amount of gaming time so I dont have the patience to be stuck on one part of a game for 30 minutes   making very little progress each gaming session.
please God  black myth wookong have to be hard as nails!!!! I dont care if most games are cinematic experiences  I enjoy them  but hardcore games need to keep being made  and black myth has potential  elden ring was such a take of fresh air!!! fresh air from hell  is sooooo goooood!!!!! I beat it 4 times is a row  loved itsooo much!!
it would be good to get a challenging game but also with solid graphics and story too rather than one or the other!
the cutscene would not be that bad if they were not moving the character in the worst place to be  with spell that ended their duration because of the cutsene lenght   be attacked right at the end of the cutscene without reaction time to save and be killed to have to review the long cutscene again withotu a way to skip it.
I recently got elden ring haven t played it yet but I have always wanted to get into the souls game I have played a little bit of the demon souls remake and bloodbourne a little bit I have always played a warrior class because I like melee but I also like spellcasting. I play this mmo by the name of runescape
praise the elden ring! therefore  praise the message!
something in between feels good too  I love elden ring and been playing it everyday since I got it but some stuff about quests can be annoying like  there s many way to start em and when something in your game doesnt work the same it did for a friend you wonder where u fuck up and got no clue what to do.. there s a secondary quest I simply dunno how to start and kinda pisses me off
elden ring is like an abusive relationship  I just cant seem to escape. its because elden ring loves me that its so harsh on me right  its because I deserve it
Im really glad I found this channel  thank you for reading my comment
love the honesty in these videos
loading up lara with a bat-belt full of  them toys  goes against her nature. lara was created in the 90 s but really is a child of the 80 s in the spirit of indiana jones  wit  weapons  a little luck  and that leather jacket are all you need.
I like story games with cutscenes yes some does hold your hands to much. I dont play shooter games that much but when I play one I want some story behind it like in destiny you can just go around shooting or play the story when you want.
I know exactly how you feel and I agree. it does seem that game developers have catered to the participation trophy crowd way more than normal gamers. games have become so easy and hold ur hand all the way through. I guess since the population of the us and world dont have common sense anymore maybe thats why this turn happens. never thought we d hit a point where people didn t want to use there brain at all. kinda odd to me. if I dont want to think I ll watch a tv show or certain movies. games have always been where Ive gone to think and challenge myself outside of real life.
at 1st I didnt like souls games  but the more I played  the more I loved them.
I haven t played any souls games  or any game like it  but Ive been wanting to because of the different play style and difficulty. itseems really fun and challenging. I love open world games  started from ff8  that have multiple levels of challenge from finding things out yourself to especially puzzles! being able to explore a world with no boundaries are waaay more fun  enjoyable and worth the money to spend than linear games that lead you to the ending credits. its really good to have a huge variety of different games from very easy to very hard that can cater everyone. if people want to spend  60 on a 2 hour  walking simulator   found that very amusing   then more power to them  but we do need more actual longer games with substance
lot of saltiness  as expected in the world of twitter. awesome vid as always melonie keep it up
good for you. not everyone wants er type rpgs. why do you think games like skyrim  and final fantasy are far bigger
@evacody124  not everyone wants skyrim and ff type rpgs.what would be special about those two  and er  if that were the case  nothing.take mmorpgs for example with all the wow clones  plenty of those crash and burn because they do nothing particularly different.
ff8 is not an open world game. it is an rpg though.but souls games and games like it are the worst rpgs of all time. stick to elder scrolls or games like grim dawn or diablo.the problem with souls games and souls like game is they took out or made a very poor story. they did that because who has time to read or watch cut scenes  no wonder hollywood has gotten so bad . took out an kind of reading and understanding stats and talents and just dumbed it down to learn how to dodge  jump  roll amd block and you will be fine.many ds fans would be recked by games like path of exile  or grim dawn  or crags or turn based because they never really played them. they all are adhd and just want action.
ya know  Im not a Christian  Im an   innist  or norse pagan  or whatever you may want to call it. just dont lump me in with the  omg my crystals and tarot cards and astrology  wiccan cringe Lords lol but anyway  I absolutely love that you do the daily verse. why  because I believe there s a lot of wisdom in the Christian Bible and in Christian doctrine. I also like to see people be themselves  unapologetically. keep boomin   mel! there s no harm in hearing a Bible verse  whether someone believes in it or not.
kids nowadays would have never been able to beat some of the games I played on my nintendo 64 where you had to either look in the settings menus or the game book for the game s controls
I remember spending days on end exploring the original final fantasy on nes - and just how I felt when I finally beat it.  I remember when I loaded up the original tomb raider and how much practice it took to get the gameplay mechanics down - but then once I did - my enjoyment increased so much!I can play skyrim infinitely  mods help that a lot  - assassin s creed series  not so much.  even as much as I loved the whole mass effect trilogy  I just dont see a replay in my future.  tomb raider reboot had more qte s than I was expecting.the lie of  accessibilty  has been used to dumb down games.edit   great verse today
remember when cutscene were a reward in gaming when getting past a part of a game.
man those old games that didnt have major cut scenes in which you had to piece together what you did and gathered to know the story and how it progressed. thats a game and not a glorified movie
its even sadder when yourealize that facing challenges that make you stop  think  and improve is a basic life mechanic. if the game gives no resistance in a genre meant to have it  combat puzzle   youre not playing anything  youre just pretending to.the thing Ive noticed is that the hardest games Ive ever played only have one difficulty. missions you have to fail more than you ll succeed if youre not careful. most games with multiple difficulties feel easy by comparison on every difficulty. they end up designed to be more about the numbers than mechanics.
Im still finding it hard to believe she s 35.    she looks very young.  she can pass for a teenager.
I love the long videos  melonie.
I like games that are a challenge   Goddamn right!
to me most games I play there is grinding so I cant throw stones at souls masochist cause Im kinda one 2 .I have to get into the story and the grind must be rewarding to be a good game so Imostly hit jrpg or my favorite game uncharted waters new horizons for snes.
they want gold and platinum trophies for just pressing a button or beating a level on the easiest difficulty.
my problem with the soulsborne style of games is that the lore is hidden. I like my story handed to me on a silver platter. Im also a controller guy. I grew playing console games so I cant do fast reflex stuff on keyboard and mouse. for this reason I stopped even trying those games and just watched lore videos on youtube.  I prefer rpgs. very direct story and gameplay I find fun. few of them require fast reflex so I can play with keyboard and mouse even if they dont have good controller support. the problem is game urinalists dont play or care about games. they are a bunch of sjws that were skilled enough to write plagiarize articles every once in while so they could preach their religion the rest of the time. however  they are not skilled enough to be able to write for the political sites where they spew their religion all the time. then the sjws that infect the hr and marketing firms point people at the articles and twitter bitchers and say  this is what the people want.  which is all a lie. it is what their evil ideology wants. a world without fun. only division and strife. I like your Bible verse section. it is helping me get back into my own faith. take care and keep being you.
some games have pretty decently tough hard  extra hard modes . its not like it use to be but still lol. I dont play in normal modes
I dont think Im a definite one side or other. I dont play souls games   im not a glutton for punishment  as I say jokingly at times  p  but then I did enjoy monster hunter world  that counts as a challenging game yea  at least the later stages  and beating some of the top monsters feels really satisfying after u failed for so long. thatsaid  I do like games that are more... relaxing... sometimes I think we just wanna unwind and blow things up for the fun of it. so its always a good thing to have variety  coz a person probably has wide tastes depending on the time as well...
elden ring is amazing. only beat one boss so far
people can enjoy easy games however they please  I just hope that they ll choose to face hard things in real life and not bail out there as well.look forward to the books of joshua and judges  those are like elden ring but in reading form. well  revelation too.
I do enjoy some of the easy games like rd2  yakuza and skyrim  but I started playing elden ring recently and its a learning curve. do I like it  yes. do I suck at it  absolutely lol.
keep up the good work.  Godspeed
just gonna copy and paste what I said on a clownfishtv vid. what I dont get is that there is already things in the game that make it easier. the type of class one plays is the first. the second is grinding levels and using the smiths to make the weapons stronger. the third is straight up summoning a group of friends randos to form a group to help take down the boss. if youre not willing to engage in those aspects of the game  than its on you that the game is hard.
I agree but also I dont watch many movies therefore I do like these more cinematic games I like here and their like a God of war or uncharted but the souls games rekindled my love for games I was getting bored for a while then demons souls remake saved my life Im loving elden ring have 50 hours in and I haven t even scratched the surface of the game
dude. I work five days a week at a hard job. the point of playing a game is that its something fun to do. if the game becomes like a 2nd job them the developers missed the point of the word game.
yeah I been playing dark souls games since the first kings field on os1 which is where the series started  and I always go level up more if I get stuck on a boss.   hell now my favorite thing is max out every stat eventually to stomp over the bosses that gave me a hard time on the first playthrough  also people talk er so much smack  er is the easiest to get into than all fromsoft games.
melonie is growing on me  this is a fun channel to watch.  I like her takes on things.  nice to see a gamer girl that isn t a woke marxist puppet.
I have gotten attacked so many times over the years  bloodborne  ds3  sekiro  and now er  just for stating my opinion on the internet. especially because I have one hand  and I always hear people say stuff to the effect of  but think of the disabled people!  and it makes me go off the rails a bit. difficulty  in this context  is part of the  game design   its not  accessibility  like they shout in my face. yes  making a game easier makes more people able to play it. but technically difficulty is something you can overcome with a little thing called practice and self reflection  i.e. was I being too greedy   did I panic roll   should I try a different weapon  etc . the fact I physically cant pull the right trigger  and have to change to south-paw in order to play  that is something that I cant overcome with my  disability   so letting me change keybinds allows that and gives me access to the intended experience of the developers. I love challenges  and overcoming them gives me purpose. I love raiding in ffxiv on savage  and I love fromsoft games  because they treat me like a big boy  and let me make my own mistakes to learn from... just like life!give me some keybinds  and thats all I ask... well that and not including me in your crusade to make games easy  just because you cant see that these games are fair  you just have to be deliberate and smart about how you play them. and yes adding an easy mode  does diminish the game for the rest of us  Im tired of hearing that excuse. it takes longer to balance  wastes development time and money  and its fundamentally against the vision of miyazakI because the oppressive world is supposed to be part of the damn game ! as he has stated over and over.
saw you on fnt. awesome videos. youre like if my inside voice had its own channel  but feminine.
completely agree. and these people already dominate 99  of the market. isn t that good enough for them  are we allowed to have 2 good games every 5 years
aaa titles with a lot of money behind them will always be made to appeal the masses. they rely a lot of sales to make their money back. therefore they have to advertise to normies  and normies are easily impressed with graphics and current trends. in general they are not going to appeal to gamers who care more about gameplay and difficulty. thats why I stopped playing big titles. it takes more work  but I spend a lot of time looking for smaller games that appeal to me  rather than just following the current hype train.
someone saying classic tomb raider controls are bad is bizarre to me.  the best thing about classic tomb raider is that the controls were so good.  they were completely consistent and perfectly responsive  lara did exactly what you demanded every time.  every death was down to the player  not control issues.
I suck at games  yet I also feel the same that many games out there are less of a game and more an interactive cinematic or participation trophy games. unfair judgment on my part I admit  but after completing gow 2018  I chose elden ring over hfw because of my experience with gow  even though I generally liked the game.
man  I just commented on this stuff on your march 12 vid and then I had to go back to get this vid in as Imissed it.  you covered it all I tried to hit on that comment.  could have saved some key strokes.  great vid  sorry I rehashed  I guess I should stick to watching in order   .    I would note I remember the shift  when demon souls hit the us  and it was panned as a game the west will never accept for its punishment and was hated on for just being a  new  idea of difficult that nobody understood.  it was hated.  then  like many things  the unknown gamer gamers of yore learned  grew  evolved  studied this game and dark souls came out. . and the grass roots gamers were able to adapt as og gamers do.  the word spread  the understanding and love made it to the right outlets and the hate went away  more people willingly tried dark souls and then demon souls suddenly had a different pov than it did. and now!  soulbourne games can do know wrong.  a game genre was hated  then loved by few and it become  cool  to be the  hard game  crowd minority  the elitism did exist but slowly diluted  and now its a massive genre where the pop culture has made it bigger than it probably really should have been because followers had to be apart of itsuddenly being cool but hey  I love those games so I am not complaining.  here is where you see  imo  the crack in casual easy mode review concepts vs gamers become the grand canyon for what has it been  over a decade or so now since demon souls
we have footage of devs being shown a dsp stream clip for pointers on how to hand hold their players.this is how you know how fucked the industry is  devs are using dsp as a barometer for player intelligence.
botw always let you know where the next objective is should you choose to go there
your statements reminds me of a scripture from the next chapter luke 14 25-33 which in many translations is labeled  the cost of discipleship . you are 100  right that being Christian is not for the faint of heart. I do not know how your faith journey went  but I know everyone in my church has to read and study thatscripture before being baptized. they call it  counting the cost . I admire you for choosing every day to carry your cross and share your faith
I was home schooled to I was the smartest and most popular kid in my school and had great teachers like roger corman who taught me that you can make a movie with the budget of 20 dollars
I think the game makers have found a map location for their next game. its the war in ukraine  hh especially battlefield. they ll start working on it right away.
congrats on your subscriber count! I added myself on the list.
I really liked jedI fallen order. I hear that is souls-lite game. however its about time synch for me at this point in my life. I have a wife and a baby. while I I think I would love elden ring I dont have time to  get good . thats ok I am glad this genre is a thing even if I personally dont have the time for it.
probably why I have been playing more retro games these days.
Im a simple man  I see a new mel video and I click.  pop s top  life is good.
I love playing as a hot dude.   and like that  you get a subscriber.
I do like play things blind but if I have too much trouble. I will go look it up on youtube. so hand holding is never really needed it. I hated the golden trail in fable 2 if youremember that.
Im terrible at soulsbourne games  and the absolute best part of playing them is bashing my head against a boss then  some crazy how  manage to beat it.
people  nowadays play games for social media streaming and to be part of a conversation. thats why elden ring pisses them off. because they cant just breeze through it for engagement and social interaction. its less about enjoyment if the actual product to young people streamers  game journos
the first time I got a participation trophy made me go wtf.
I think people who have not played any of the souls games  dont understand that there is co-op and the intention is that you team up to take out a boss... when you get gud you can do it yourself.
I used to hate hate hate multi-player games. then I tried overwatch and loved it. it is ok to not like stuff. it is also ok to try new things.
day 10 of commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me too. I love that this channel is growing so much. need more based gaming takes out there.
can Imake a confession  I picked up next gen cyberpunk 2077 while waiting for elden ring to release and Im having so much fun playing cyberpunk Ive barely played elden ring. there  I said it. I feel like a traitor to the community.
when the video came up my first thought was  wow! shoulders! I dont remember seeing so much skin.  it made me feel all...funny...  please see the explanation in the last comment below
if I like you  youre allowed to disagree with me.if I dont like you...you must bow to the wisdom of the trash panda! evil laugh also conga-rats on 25k!
it always amazes me when someone says  I am 30 ...  and they look 20-something  and I look like their dad  I am over 30 as well . wtf did I do... oh never mind... I remember but I cannot share.  live fast die young   I didn t die...
saw it years ago when wow dumbed down the hunters epic quest for there legendary bow quiver. before they did you knew who the good hunters were if they completed that quest.
_  I saw rag dolled lara a lot in the original on the saturn. how many times did I die trying to figure out how to get on the sphinx
hey melonie you should check out the cinemax show banshee also love this new channel of yours.
I love games with no hand holding.... its also the reason I buy retro games on steam...
I remember the tomb raider comics michael turner made some damn good female art designs
congrats on 25k! that was fast!
personally I think the Bible verses is one of the greatest things in any youtubers videos I love how you do that at the end
true. as much as I loved oblivion  it was a perfect example of the dumbification of games. in morrowind you d get a quest that would come with directions that you d have to read so you d know where to go. oblivion was like  just follow the marker until you find something to kill or pick up. skyrim was even worse for all that.
there is literally nothing wrong with having both. yeah elden ring is hard but some of it is artificial. its not that you need a quick reaction time or great timing. you just have to know what to do. and most of the games youre trashing have options for not only difficulty but for exploration as well. like horizon or assassins creed.  also a lot of games back in the day were so hard because they were only 2 hours long. but it took you 74 tries to beat it all without losing all your lives.
views are participation trophies  subscribers are achievements.
I never wanted to touch mp in cod. only wanted the single-player campaign. my brother got me bo4 to play with him and Im all about the mp these days.
why  elden ring like the souls games are just fake rpgs. they take away all the elements of what rpgs are based on d d. if you make the rpg a nightmare to play then there is no point in putting in a leveling system with spells and so on. the first boss in an rpg should not be a nightmare to get past. the first dungeon should not be a nightmare.  if it is then why did I waste my time leveling up and reading up about the spells and skill to put points into so its just a button masher  yeah thats not what an rpg is.not even skyrim and  witcher 3 are like that.
why because some people dont play it on ultra hard extreme. why do you care how someone play a single player game  in what way is it hurting you
@evacody124  bruh he didnt even talk about the difficulty   he is talking about the quset design and world desgin.
@evacody124  I liked it better the other way. I dont care how you play. but this isn t just a matter of you playing how you want and me doing the same. they changed the game to cater to you. if they wanted to change it  fine. their game  their choice. but Im entitled to my own opinion on it. in what way is my opinion hurting you
@evacody124   in what why is it hurting you   the  stupid quest desgin make the game less injoyable  imagine playing a puzzle game where all the puzzle are automatically sloved for you
@abdullah_gaming  true. I remember crawling over half of red mountain looking for a particular tomb that the directions to find were vague and approximate. when I finally did find it  not only did it feel like an accomplishment  it also made you feel like  I can see why this tomb was lost to the ages. . it felt like discovering a legit lost tomb as opposed to  well the glowie thing is above the door so I guess this it. .
@iowa dan  that makes sense. it was lost to the ages for a reason. that adds to the immersion.
@upsidedown machiatto2  exactly!
the only thing I didn t like about morrowind was the chance to hit mechanic. would have liked it more if the weapon looks like it made contact  then its a hit  with damage reduction where relevant. likewise  if you raise your shield  itshould count as a block  smaller damage despite blocking is fine where relevant . but yeah  I did like the sense of adventure you got from it.
@azu  totally legit complaint. that r.n.g. to hitstuff just didn t work well. I wish they d have fixed that in oblivion and left pretty much everything else the same as it was in morrowind. that would ve been the perfect game for me. and the thing is  Im not even against all the quest markers and instant travel bs that @evacody124 wants. my point is that they should ve kept thatstuff in an  easy mode . then you can have the regular type mechanics in  normal mode  and maybe even get rid of the normal h.u.d. for  hard mode . three different modes for three different levels of gamer. everyone is happy that way.
@azu morrowind s accuracy mechanics would be more immersive if a  miss  resulted in a parry  block  or dodge rather than just a whoosh.
its a problem with definition and what they are called in marketing. western game producers   aaa game  japanese game producers   visual novel.
I agree. elden ring is probably the best game Ive played in the last 4 years. that includes doom eternal.
while I occasionally enjoy a game where I can just switch off my brain and button mash but overall I prefer games that offer a challenge.
there is a bunch of the same kinds of people that are complaining that the end meta event in the new guild wars 2 expansion is too hard for  disabled  people and should be made easier. whenever I hear those arguments I remember the quadriplegic guy that beat sekiro.
congrats on 25k subs melonie
hard games should exist  easy games should exist  middling games should exist  games where you can change the difficulty should exist  and everything else in between should exist. play what you like and leave off what you dont. that people want to police what and how others play is ridiculous. I personally like to play both hard games and easy games.
I kind of like tomb raider  the way it is right now to be honest. the story and cut scenes based approach is very interesting to me. I dont play games because I want them to kick my ass  I play games because I want to be immersed in the story and experience. original tomb  raider games from the 90s didn t do it for me long-term     they kind of bored me and frustrated me at times  even though I did like them. didn t have enough reason to invest tons of hours into them. also  if I want it to be more difficult  I just  turn up the difficulty.
congrats on 25k  friend
maybe Im biased  but I think around past 2010 I started exclusively buying japanese developed games because they aren t just graphics and movie cutscenes.
hey mel I just want to say that the problem with gaming industry back in the day was not so big problem back then but it is now  ok mel. anyway these video games that we grow up with was different back then and these new games that is out now is new and has new graphics and it has new sounds to the new video games that is out now  ok mel. anyway I hope you understand what I am trying to tell you on this topic  ok mel. anyway I hope you have a great evening at home with your pets and have a good night mel.
love the video  but there are two things that could be improved from a clarity standpoint  giving example of these  participation trophy  games  which I canthink of a few but giving your own examples would could help your case. number two isn t even something that can be  helped  per say but its this seemingly  no true scotsman  sounding argument of  how video games are supposed to played . that could also be why some people got butthurt because thats how itsounded to them  it may have sounded like you were saying they aren t true gamers because the games they play aren t true games.
the ultimate challenge was the scramble for moms french fries back in the day I got stabbed with a fork once over those fries
melonie... life is too short for twitter  and the people on it ... its troll heaven  and not worth your time  ..... great video cheers
they get upset because they want access to everything without the effort of fighting for it.  thats why they dont like games that are difficult.  I just wish they would let those who want games to be difficult have our games.
congratulations on your subs but woooooooo elden ring! I had to break down and buy and xbox cuz I was tired of missing all the good games I d prefer a ps5 with a disk drive but I dont wanna pay 800  and if I could have at the intro to covid I d have buy one then if not for thoes who wanted to be pieces of cr p by buying them all up and sell them for absorbent prices but who cares now elden ring! wooooooooo and killer instinct! wooooooooo
gg melonie o  25k subs. elden ring is hard af
nothing says hand holding like painting every clime-able ledge in a game. if these kids went back and played the first 3 tomb raiders their brains would melt.
since like 10 years ago  the great games come mostly from japan
this is one of some reason why I have more support  to north asian aaa dev  even tho they have their own problems  rather than western aaa dev
they want us to beat the games in a weekend and buy a new one the next week.
@kopperneoman  that would ve been cool too!
those old tomb raider games are just action adventure  platform games.elden ring is trying to be an rpg with action adventure  platform  game play.problem is people dont seem to understand why mass effect andromeda was disliked or why final fantasy 8 or 13 are disliked. its because of th3 bad lazy story telling.you can have the best game play every if you have a bad story in an rpg the game is bad.
I like your longer videos personally. thank you for sharing your faith in God. God bless you and your family. duane.
great vid.. I agree. ...Im always remined of the phrase  remember  a dead fish can float downstream  but it takes a live one to swim upstream. - w. c. fields . so can I encourage you to keep running the race and reading your Bible everyday.
fire insurance lmao keep being you. awesome video
dont worry about being a steelers fan  nobody s perfect.
congrats on the subscribers hon  3
imagine getting upset thatsomeone likes a enjoys a feeling of accomplishment in their games
it feels like these folks haven t played enough games not being snide or condescending. after castlevania  ninja gaiden and some smt titles. gotten kinda comfortable dying or losing all my lvl grinding progress.but Im a little surprised waypoints bother folks. I kinda just ignore them and do my own thing till Im ready.
its a good balance when the game will show me where I am going  but dont tell me how to get there I ll choose that
you rock melonie.
26 10  if they can keep us mad and the people around us.  then we wont pay attention or get mad at the things people above us are doing.
did melonie ever play doom eternal  I think its a great counter example to the typical  kid gloves  modern game.
the trophy people cant let people enjoy games with a challenge because they dont want anybody having a trophy they cant also have.also hell is very interesting to look into because the Bible s original text uses 3 different words. one word refers to the  long sleep  preceding birth and resurrection  another refers to basically a  dead  land where those who hate or reject the God can be free of him  his living influence and his protection  and the last word refers to a special  fiery  hell reserved for fallen angels and their followers.
this is the husband of one of my best friends!
I just dont have time to gitgud. I play maybe a 2-4 hour block every couple months. I dont wanna spend the entire time struggling through the tutorial only to return months later having forgot it  but also just never making progress.
so  is itstill your  new  channel if it gets more views than your old channel
I 100  agree on the walking simulator.  really  most games now days you could just watch a yt gameplay and have the same effect.  all cut scenes with the illusion of playing.  here  play  go from point a to point b  dont worry I ll mark it on the map so you dont get lost.  yeah  dont worry the game will do most of the work. no go.   then there s the hand holding for everything.  and they either have a long ass tutorial at the beginning or insert minI tutorials throughout the whole game. and if you are like me and like to explore and look around  even if its very clear that you should go forward.  the game immediately start pestering youreminding you where you need to go and what you have to do. things I love about old tomb raider  and other games.  if you wanted to play you just did.  the tutorial was in the house  that for the first game  we didn t play her house until we have already play the main line a couple of time. we figure out things like the appropiate amount of space to be able to run jump on our own and everything else.  youreally needed to explore to find the secrets.  and figure out what to do on your own.  sometimes there were clues.  but sometimes there really weren t any.  it was more of a logic and common sense on your part of what to do.  and yeah  I sometimes wanna play a game that will not stress me.  but then gain  games like how tr use to be dont stress me.  while hand holding games do a lot. since I hate been told what to do. now its like every game has their personal navy. even jrpgs have been ruin by that hand holding mentality.  and when they wanna add some  dificulty  they just add it artificially  or a bs boss that have like a bizillion hp.  that its not really hard  just a nuisance to deal with.  and for those that dont like hard games  fine  there are hundreds of other games.  why must they complain about the one hard game that came this year.  cause really  we get a game like this what. every 2 years  they get 10 hand holding games.  but its not enough. they want every game to be hand holding.what I really have issue with is that most if not all of the  hard  games have similar aesthetics.  like  they aren t games I could pause to eat something cause 10 minutes in there will be a stomach-churning event.  and its not the blood.  I have no problems with games like sekiro or nioh or idk old gow.  but there is something about souls games and newest gen re.  thatsomething will happen and I ll be alike  ewwwww   devil may cry are very fun to play.  I like jrpgs for their story mostly and the tactical mechanics.  but games like dmc are just fun to play.  since you had a ps  did you play crash bandicoot   that it was re-release not so long ago and so many people were complaining about how  hard  it is. even tho it was something me and my siblings played for fun back then. today s crybabies wouldn t be gamers if they had to deal with the games we play from nes to ps1.I live in a religious town  the hypocritical kind  there are a few good. but most aren t.  and not been of faith makes your life a lot harder.  from favors  to help when needed.  you are marginalize by most.   there are exceptions  my friends grandma. she is deeply religious  goes to church every morning  catholic  and she has always been kind  helpful and caring.  and although she knows my believes dont align.  she was never judgmental or mean or anything. she is always there when you need her.  and isn t happy about how some other  people of faith  would treat people.  she knows thats not the way  for its not our place as humans to judge.  same goes for my ex mother in law. I remember going to mass with her  and the family. and my ex was even less enthusiastic.  I told her that  although I do not believe in the church.  the reason why I would agree to such events was because of her mom and family.  I saw it as an activity to spend time with her.  just like you would watch a movie you dont really care for with friends.  we could go to mass with her mom cause it was important to her.  also awesome lady.
in pretty much every game that lets me create my own character  I play as a chick  because I just like to. you should see my red dead 2 character  she looks like a badass  old west  white female version of blade.
read the title and immediately clicked because it is so fucking true
hardcore challenge gamers are a minority and the big bucks lies in making games to be as close to the flow difficulty as possible. gaming has become an art with many different interpretations on what makes a good game. most people just want their dopamine kicks  some wanna enjoy they story that is being told and others enjoy that grit your teeth and endure frustration as they keep failing kind of games.resident evil 4 was a great example of how the gaming difficulty changed. with a dynamic difficulty that made the game easier or harder depending on how successful you were at progressing trough the game  it made you feel challenged enough to have fun but not frustrating enough to feel like it was a real struggle.and west really do enjoy more flow difficulty in general because it gives them more endorphins and dopamine kicks  which is not a coincidence. aaa studios mostly make games to earn money and what gets players hooked fast and hard is more profitable. even in competitive games there are a lot of mechanics to keep people hooked  matchmaking  earn points and rewards even if you lose  progression no matter outcome  tho its more when you  win   .in the west we are also seemingly more into power fantasies  which might be the reflection on how most people feel powerless in everyday life. which ofc is capitalized by the industry.the hard core games like elden ring has its place in the west but since that community is smaller than the casual scene  most studios will focus on the bigger communities since that get them more money. unless its a smaller indie studio  which has risen quite a lot because smaller communities flock more to their games that often is a bit more grit ur teeth than having a flow experience.
gaming journalist cant even play arma 3 and insurgency sandstorm
ninja gaiden is not an rpg. seems to me people keep thing rpgs should be like that. no thats not how it works. thats like lazypeon wanting mmorpgs to be full on pvp. if thats what people like him want then drop the rpg from it. same with the souls games and elden ring. if you want to make it like ninja gaiden then stop calling it an rpg if the first boss I face feels like its the final boss of the game. then the makers missed the plot big time.
dlcs for that are fun. game journalists complaining they couldn t beat the marauder or some of the slayer games first go is funny
maaaan Imiss the lucas arts star wars games  particularly games like shadows of the empire and the force unleashed. they were difficult  but fun. Im not sure id like soulsborn games  though  because they seem so hard I d get frustrated and stop playing. I really like story in games  too...there s clearly story in soulsborn games  but itseems like there s also a lot of mysteries that dont get solved and thats also frustrating for me xdbut yeah  the force unleashed. I d like more games like that  where it was tough but not aggravating to beat the first time  then you ramp it up a difficulty notch or two on the second one and youre like  oh crap....
steelers nation yoi!! double yoi!! loving your content thus far.
I see my post about the game which I just lost. love your work mel. keep it up.
so personally I hate souls-borne games but its not the difficulty its the story if Im gonna play a single player game I want a big epic cinematic experience but I dont want to be hand held through it either. botw was cool and I like what it did but same thing its there s not much there for me but the game play is fun the other issue I have is reading I cant do it if I have to read Im out so unless its voice acted Im not gonna get the story thats there I feel like there s nothing out there for me. there have been a few games recently that are for your tastes like elden ring but everything other than that is the handholdy stuff and I dont want that either why cant we get some western style cinematic experiences that also give you a challenge. I thought jedI fallen order would be cool since it was built like a souls-borne but Im pretty bad at games and I beat that on the highest difficulty level so idk
lara need to be more like revy from black lagoon
with old games I would spend  20  play hundreds of hours  and never notice the graphics. with nee games I think  that looks awesome  spend  60  play it for 10-20 hours  get bored  and never play again.
where s your terrible towel young lady  I dont consider the reindeer to be an elite qb  however  it wouldn t be wise for the team to give up on him right now. currently we ve got an opportunity to patch a bunch of holes in other areas on the team since we actually have cap space for the first time in years. years!  Im really excited for that.  getting a competitive qb right now would certainly eat into that  hurting us improving other spots  as well as would be dumb as hell considering we dont have an o line that can block for more than 3 seconds which wouldn t give that qb much of a chance to get the ball down the field anyway. the draft class this year is weak in both qb and o line. so we aren t getting any cheap good talent at those spots this year either. so until we have a solid o line from either bringing in new guys or letting the current group get some experience and learn how to play together  we shouldn t worry about who the qb is because they re gonna spend too much time in the grass to be useful anyway. spend the money on defense and maybe pick up a mid talent runner or two to bolster the rotation and take some of the pressure off of who ever the qb is  and lean on what made the team great in the first place... a solid run game and a suffocating defense. you dont need to score 35 points when you have the ball for 40 minutes and the other team cant score.
you must comply with my feels!!!!!  wokies
I guess I just dont believe that any dev can magically know what is an appropriate difficulty level for all players.  I dont want to be bashing my head against the same mission countless times.  I just want to have fun playing video games.  if I wanted to be frustrated  I d go swipe on tinderellas that will never date me.   not every game has to be for every gamer  sure  but if elden ring had an option for a more casual experience  they d have a bigger audience.  gate-keeping for its own sake just causes the problem we have now.  none of the players that want the real challenge are hurt by someone else playing the game.  heck  you could even have a special ending or other unlocks for the people that do it the hard way  and I d be incentivized to give it a shot.  no one benefits here.  fromsoft misses out on a big chunk of the potential audience.  casual gamers like me miss out on what could be a great game.  the hardcore players miss out on a larger overall playerbase  which incentivizes the devs to make more content.
I am from a sports background... not everyone is good enough to play their favourite sport competitively.  and we live with that fact.why cant these selfish  gamers  face up to this fact thatsports fans have learned to live with for years
final thoughts longer videos are better.screw the haters.
some people play games to escape   have fun. some people have fun with story-driven games. some people want to be challenged. some dont like single player. I dont really see why everything has to be so tribal. you can praise one thing without putting down another imo.
returnal felt great beating because of this.
dark souls humble people... you ha e no idea how loud I laugh when I hear da truthalso dont forget about sekiro  that game humbled even some soulsborne veterans
it is not a video game  if they are holding you hand!
gamers can always do what I do. wait until a youtuber makes a how to video to pass a area.
you might enjoy jordan peterson s biblical lectures. although he s done only lectures on genesis. but enough to have a whole series on. its deep. or dennis prager s fireside chat.
Im glad I found you
a participation trophy is like fat free ice cream - its worthless.Ive seen interviews with developers and one thing that I notice about them is that they seem to think that gamers are complete morons and need to be hand held all the time. games now might be visually better but as far as game play goes they are no where close to old school arcade games from the very late 70s and early to mid 80s. those games were brutal on your concentration and timing.
you need yo get your other channel listed in the channels tab
tomb raider and similar games have gotten way to easy . I am not the only one that thinks they need to do away with the constant prompts . there needs to be an option to turn that off . I understand that they do thatso anybody can play but it is just so freaking condescending and boring . I am not a fan of top down camera angle type of games if I am thinking of the correct game . like you said everybody is entitled to their own opinion .
idk I am more of an mmo fan. I do prefer japan and korean mmos over warcraft.
it is possible that new channels grow faster is because viewers dont yet see ads.google search show only 27  of americans and 46.2  of worldwide users use ad blockers.
what makes games like eldin ring and botw successfully achieve is a focus on the gameplay. its great if games have engaging stories  music  characters  etc.  but if the conversation around a game always focuses on these elements rather than the actual gameplay  thats a clear sign of the fundamental shortcomings of the actual game.with games like eldin rings or botw the conversations almost always centers around aspects like exploration  puzzles  the brutal difficulty  actual features of the game design.  everything else is secondary  which is why games such as these are a cut above the rest.  this isn t to say either game is perfect  they both have they re share of problems  but the good overwhelmingly outweighs the negatives.  its also not to say there shouldn t be great stories  characters  music  etc  but the primary focus should always be on the gameplay.
its the internet. you could talk about kittens and somehow some douche feels  offended  by something said. oh my narratives!!!!
I have played the dark souls games and when it comes to this game  I honestly dont see what makes elden ring so great  its either another dark souls clone or its connected to dark souls some how. either way  I have seen a couple of my friends play it and I just dont see anything different about it compared to dark souls and thats my opinion on it. others may like it. I just dont see anything new nor different about it to make me want to play it.
from multilayer is mega competitive and also wonderfully generous and cruel in equal measure
I play on easy mode no shame lol.
im hoping the success of elden ring inspires other creators to serve the demand for this type of game  rather than churn out the samey ubisoft open world games over and over.
heaven and he ll is when black sabbath was fronted by ronnie james dio
in tomb raiders case  the old games  they are honestly painful to go back and play control wise if you didn t grow up with them. I will put it this way  the tomb raider games came out when companies were still experimenting with locomotion and how to make a 3d game control  games today more or less have this down... rockstar being a notable exception where they add another 60-120ms of input lag to every motion for more realistic animation rather than very responsive controls. its honestly sad how good modern controls are and how hard it is to go back once you are use to it.
the thing is  is people who play from software games are better gamers. itsounds cringe. but the people who play those games persevere to get better. they actually work for it and improve themselves in the process. its not that they re just naturally better because reasons. the people who beat these games worked hard where others didn t. that makes them worse gamers objectively speaking. if they dont like it  they need to work harder. otherwise they cant complain because its the personal choice not to be able to play them
im goin to check out elden ring some day monster hunter rise metroid dread n getsufumaden n pokemon arceus been kicking my ass along with an old legend that resurface my life dang switch
so...why is the assumption always that western developers  level puzzle designers  qa testers  dumb-down their games for the audience. has anyone questioned whether or not  the developers themselves are smart enough to create more intellectually challenging games
I think im the minorty but I tend to prefer games with stories I like want to follow like kingdom hearts and thats probs why I prefer tekken to mortal combat or street fighter
in modern world of warcraft you barely have to participate and get rewards at the same timegated rate as top end players. and for the most powerful player gear  you buy wow tokens with real money and spend that on the legendary items lol. literally no participation required. blizz knows its audience for sure.
I love challenge in games. explains why I have 1800 hours in dota 2. been having fun in elden ring too. nothing quite like hitting your head against a brick wall until the wall breaks lol.that being said  easy and relaxing games have their place too but it doesnt mean you have to take anything away from hard games. keep both types as they are
twitter robots really like there life sims...
I prefer video games that give me the beatdown  like kingdom come deliverance. I dont want to feel like a mary su  I want to feel like a champion!
its crazy how fast and how much people get butthurt cause of someone opinion but there opinion is suppose to be taken as gold. insanity
I was once on a boss run  and was just shy of a level I hoped would give me the edge  it didn t wouldn t you know it  got invaded. I entered panic mode  it wasn t impossible to royally screw up in this area  Imight not get them back  artorias dlc . maybe if I get to the boss room   a..n..d.. there he is...  I step side to side  I check the emotes   nothing! how do I change them again  there s no time he took pity on me. dropped some items  including a ring of sacrifice  which hadn t occurred to me and still didn t til after he waved farewell and departed.disaster averted
on a separate occasion  I rested at firelink while I went to eat.  Im safe at a bonfire  I thought...Im just sitting there  the menu drops out  you are being invaded   and he finds me at the bonfire. he plays around for a while before determining Im not coming back any time soon.but he doesnt kill me. instead he kicks me off the cliff to a patch he knows I ll land safely on  but will leave me stranded. I come back from my meal  and before I can ask  what am I doing down here  Ive tried to move my character into the cliff and fallen to my death. respawn and where do you think my souls are sitting  yep  right on that little patch. Imake the effort  planning to homeward bone  and obviously miss the ledge.cant remember if they were worth anything  Ive lost so many millions of souls  the big ones dont stand out any more
25 22 people tend to latch onto what they are passionate about  they want what they like to be made for them  so they will go hard on the flaws to the point of nitpicking
ok but here s the thing. mortal kombat is ment and supposed to be hard and extreme. its a skill based game.rpgs should not be like that. nor should single player action games or horror games. people keep pushing that level of extreme in those games and itsucks. I dont want to feel like I can never get past a boss like in mortal kombat in my rpg game.seems to me people here have never played table top pen and paper d d before.  its no fun if the dm makes itso hard you van finish what the group started.
jeez kind of like all the aisan pay to win mmos outside of final fantay 14.
@evacody124  I think youreplied to the wrong comment.
yeah then you dont want an rpg.
@evacody124  what do you know what I want  what do you think you are  santa claus
I have guided on horizon to just take me from point a-z with some side quests. the gameplay is great but Godamn its bloated with typical open world stuff.
I know Im late to the party  though  I wouldn t say modern gaming caters to people like me  mentally damaged people or your  participation trophy crowd  . however  I would say that  for a long time  the video gaming industry was not focused on our demographic enough to produce games meant for our level of mentality. so  that being said  what s worse...having games for mentally challenged people  or normal people trying to take over said games for their own selfish fun
not like Ive been watching you a long time. I subscribed at about 1500 subscribers. if youremember any of my comments  Im a bit...odd. Im not trying to be a creep  its just what came to mind to say. I feel like I should explain myself. I thought it was humorous even if slightly  true. so I will say it next comment. here goes...
a short time ago  I watched a review of the remake of monster world iv. the guy gave it a mediocre score  with his main complaint being that the game was unfairly difficult. I thought  dude  is this your first retro platformer
you know it is all about money.  I think they spell it partI ipation.
you definitely  have your finger on the pulse of normal people gamers aka the none istaphobes
this style of development killed all the tom clancy games.
the easy walking simulators are really made because these companies want to expand the audience to casual gaming...which is ok if its a party game like a lot of the nintendo games are like this....but you dont make your huge massive rpg or action adventure a walking simulatorreally this whole debate complaint never made sense  since most games have multiple difficulty modes
when someone says a game is trash  just because they dont like it or they re bad at it  their opinion itself is trash and probably shouldn t be heeded.your taste in games does not govern the quality of them.also  the souls games have always had player interaction   co-operative multiplayer  and pvp  they are not solely single player games.
let s get you to 1 million
hI there! Im not a fan of souls games  as a matter of fact  I hate them. but thats more of a difference of why I play. there is no right or wrong reason why someone plays  but for me I love role-playing games bc I want to step out of my life and into this other world. dont get me wrong  I love souls games  lore  I just find them shallow and boring  and I can get the lore without playing the game.
thats why I always advise people to play indie games or fromsoft games  not aaa trash. they know what I desire.I like to play challenging  games  soulslikes  bullet hell  survival horror  stuff like that. does that make me an  elite player   you tell me  I die all the time. I suck at fps games for example  because I dont play them. I got hooked on doom 2016 and doom eternal however and play on ultra violence. I die often but the game is fun  all encounters are like puzzles.I would never say that counterstrike or whatever is a bad game  I am just not qualified to give an opinion.
hellblade senua s sacrifice is like dark souls it dous not hold you hand
I am loving elden ring gameplay  but my Lord am I disappointed in the lack of fulfilling the story potential.
hot take  all the dark souls games are easy.
devs these days just dont seem to get it. graphics alone is not synonymous with quality.
Im an athiest  and the thing which annoyed me about some Christians in the 80s and 90s was them trying to push their beliefs on other people.  now itseems like as the amount of athiests has grown  they re doing the same thing and pushing their beliefs onto Christians.  respect for staying true to what you believe even though thats probably difficult in current day.
25k boomers  we could take over new vegas with such a force.
it isn t difficult for games to be hard and easy and doesnt diminish a game  hand holding participation trophies is an unfair take here. what about all the people that cant play due to physical limitations
go boom!!!!!!!
um not really.  Im kind of sick of the gamers who want everything to be hardcore and pvp.
@evacody124  I wasn t talking to you... this is melanie s video I was commenting on her video to her.I have to ask .why exactly would you think I was speaking to you
blitzed all my conservative channels... hope that brings you some subs.
its statements like this that are the problem.  there video games why are you gatekeeping video games  why are you doing it to the point that we get a game like elden ring that is not finished or ready to go for pc with bugs and glitches. no one cares if you are elite at video games. thats like saying you are a elite at guitar hero. no one gives a rats ass. play the songs on a real guitar and get back to me.no one cares if you are elite at racing games  madden  fifa  nba  mlb  etc go try the real thing. video games are there to live out a fantasy. thats it end of story.
@evacody124  video games should deliver to their core audience. not all games should cater to everyone if you ask me.all the more impressive that elden ring delivered for the fans and also won many new players over.I dont care at all if someone is good at sports or not btw.
interesting   I ll be sure to check it out
Ive always thought that people should never cloud anyone s judgment with their beliefs. Im a spiritualist so I know what youre going through
@purple pill philosophy  nonsense. japan is the least religious country on earth and they re awesome. some of the most religious are miserable places like columbia.
@purple pill philosophy  shinto is not a serious religion. its just a cultural practice and even then its for old people.
the problem is they keep trying to put the skill based elements that are sports games into rpgs. it needs to stop.  if people want hard skill based games they can go play madden  or wwe  or street fight  or all the other skill based fighting and sports games. any rpg  or action game like tomb raider  or ac are not those games. so wanting them to have that level well thats what has really hurt call of duty and battlefield. they took single player games and turned them into sports like titles where pvp is all that matters.
@evacody124  something tells me you haven t played many  if not any  retro games....
only reason Im not into soulsbourne type games is that circular skating rink lock on system and the fact that Im allowed to dodge roll too often. makes the combat look all weird and unnatural. Im picky about in-game combat animations on a psychotic level and I only like physics based combat  no matter how difficult or easy it is. which is why Im more into games like ghost of tsushima  the arkham series  shadow of mordor  sifu  etc where the combat is smooth and makes me feel like the character. in fact  the only reason I play spider-man on ultimate difficulty is so that the baddies fight in a way that looks more natural and makes the fight look more intricate. same with the lethal mode in ghost of tsushima  it gets rid of the game logic spongy characters - either me or the enemie characters will die from a bladed weapon as if we re actually getting hit by one.that being said  Im with you on the participation trophy bit. this demand for everything to be easy doesnt sit right with me. its like they want everyone to have instant gratification without earning it  making everyone in our society to make us weak and I took note of how you emphasized that about western game development. so this could be a thing thats being done to us on purpose. didn t expect to make this comment political but something just really stood out to me all of a sudden...
Ive honestly never liked the souls games. they re not hard  just trial and error punishing. I do enjoy harder games that take time to master but souls games aren t about skill but rather just learning boss mechanics and memorizing animations.
better to be right with God than society
if Im going to pay a lot of money on a game  I want my monies worth. making things easy so youre done with a game in a day  isn t that a waste of money compared to spending a week or 2 to beat a game  like dark souls
what is your let s play channel  and why is it not listed  promote!edit  nvm  found it... https   www.youtube.com c meloniemac you should still link it  though...
personally love all the souls games and elden ring is amazing. I didn t find botw fun personally  probably one of the worst games made in the past 5 years  in my opinion.
no kidding  I remember buying a game and getting a trophy for just hitting the start button

youre so lovely  it makes me proud to have eyeballs!
if I didn t know better I would ve thought melanie the creation of 2 weird science weeb nerds anime fantasy
you know  I just dont like soulsborne style games. thats just my prerogative. I didn  t enjoy breath of the wild either  but something about open world games just doesnt do it for me. I like difficulty in nightmare modes in jrpgs or hard modes in scrolling shooters etc. I love savage raiding in ffxiv. thatsaid  I feel the same about modern aaa titles as the rest of us  I grew up with japanese devs and I will die on that hill. they re blowing the western gaming climate out of the water with high quality titles completely uninterested in the woke narrative and the handholding set pieces coming from developers on this side of the pond. I think the thing is that they re the only ones making games that are just fun.
companies need to dumb it down for the typical american.  most modern games are nothing more than time sinks with the hope you ll get annoyed by the repetition and finally fold and pay for a subscription or whatever it is you need to buy.  I use to enjoy dark age  world of tanks  and tried many others.  most of these games got dumbed down or catered to the as you say participation trophy crowd as the game got older.  most games follow a template the most popular that can be played on a smart phone are nothing more than a sophisticated one armed bandit.  they stimulate your pleasure sensors steadily until they reel you in  Ive seen the same look in their eyes as the crack head I once worked with.  dos games may not have had the best graphics but at least they were diverse and many were just plain fun.
ok the butthurt comment made me actually laugh. it is so rude yet so true at the same time. hahaha
therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord   2 timothy 1 8 .  sometimes following Christ requires us to be brave and stand up to people   speak truth to one another  render true and sound judgments   zechariah 8 16    and yes  it can initially be a bitscary  but it is always worth it. whenever Ive trusted that God knows best and I acted as the Bible indicates that I should he has rewarded me with peace and joy in knowing that I did right.  I have always regretted the times when I was cowardly and remained silent when I knew that God wanted me to  stand firm in the faith  be courageous  be strong   1 corinthians 16 13 .  be brave  melonie!  its worth it!
melonie  you ever beat dark souls
Ive grown quite racist when it comes to aaa studio developers  I only want games made in japan and I ll accept s korea  especially console games and Ive never though the west came half to the japanese developers on consoles. pc is a different story and thats where the west always shined going back to doom  quake  half life etc. indie games Im not as much a regionalist. hollow knight is a masterpiece in metroidvania  australian. the only game series I cared about story is kind of legend of zelda  metal gear solid 1-3 and silent hill 1-3. Ive always been a gameplay guy  so I play a lot of super mario maker 2. on stories like silent hill  the gameplay and puzzles are still top notch  the story just compliments the gameplay. journalists who cried about metroid dread that they wanted to  experience the story  honey there s barely a story. cry harder.
new to your channel after the fnt appearance and have enjoyed about a half dozen of your vids thus far  then I hit this one. this  easy-mode  idiocy I think rippa started is nonsense  ffs  youre comparing a kids game in breath of the wild to dark souls 5  elden ring. I wont even waste my breath on botw  as anyone that thinks that game is anything but average jrpg nonsense is clearly enjoying the nostalgia more than the game  but get your enjoyment where you can  as we all should. thatsaid  to bash other games as hand-holding contrasting the to souls.......that is sheer idiocy. the souls fanboys are one notch up from witcher fanboys  who at least got a dose of reality when cyberpunk dropped. souls  which elden ring is  is so overhyped in difficulty its laughable. you will def die more in the first 5-6 hours than in other games as that is the game design  however  once you get better gear  the enemies get no tougher and no decent player will die more than any other game by that point  save to the bosses  but that is also game design. no hand-holding  clues written by other players telling you how to do everything and find every secret isn t hand-holding  the ability to summon co-op players to carry you through the entire game isn t hand-holding  elden ring is the easiest souls game to date with many broken builds......just stop with this nonsense or look in the mirror when you accuse others of virtue-signalling. still enjoying 95  of your content
how do you choose relevant scripture at the end
I dont see any problem with easier modes in gaming so long as they also include a harder mode as well
modern gaming late gen 7-current  is just not as good as old school gaming  generation 5-6
I unlisted most of my videos there because I ruined that channel so bad by uploading a ton of different random category videos  and the youtube algo hates the channel now lol! so this is just my main channel now. maybe I ll bring back some let s plays on the old channel again sometime for fun though  d
@melonie mac go boom  sounds awesome... keeping itseparate makes sense  but I d love to see more people on our side doing let s plays and I d hate to see you leave that if its something you enjoy. honestly  let s plays are how I find new games  too  so it would be great to have someone with taste pushing product actually worth playing.
couldn t agree more. I couldn t even play botw after 20 hours. that to me wasn t the right franchise to do that type of open world. elden ring is the perfect setting for the open world
thing is breath of the wild is easier to play then the soulborne games because at least zelda games remember that rpgs are not supposed to be final dungeon style from the start.
the nice thing of the participation trophy games is you dont have to think about it as much. the nice thing of the old school games like souls games is the challenge that forces you to think and adapt in order to beat them. the difference is you get a hell of a lot more satisfaction from the souls style game than from a  pt  type .
unpopular opinion  bloodborne made me rage-quit in less than the first hour of playing it  which is the biggest reason Ive been avoiding elden ring.
give us a resident evil souls like games
I saw this trend start happening in gaming the first time I heard that aim assist was a thing.  being a pc gamer playing games like quake and ut for years only to see trash games like halo gain popularity by holding the players hand by literally aiming for them I knew it was the beginning of the end for high skill level competitive gaming.
commenting to feed the algorithm .   and for the 25k
late to the game but fully agree and its abundantly clear in pretty much anything with a trophy system... get your first kill  build your first whatever.. baby takes his first step. blah blah blah
Im not religious but Ive read the Bible. it one of the most important books for humanity. i

feminists are hypocrites. they talk about toxic masculinity but most of them date fairly masculine men and expect them to live up to traditional gender roles that benefit them  providing  protecting  etc . it actually makes male feminists even more funnier as a concept because feminists wont usually date a soyboy. also about interracial relationships. my wife is japanese and I have had people  all white women  make some comments about fetishizing. sometimes they say it in a joking tone but you cantell they are actually bothered by it. it feels like a good portion of white women are envious of asian women for whatever reason. I think that is why they try so hard to turn liking other races into being a  problem .
I cant play these hard games. not because Im a pussy but I have a terrible temper. Ive smashed up a snes  master system  megadrive and ps1 because of some of their old school games. I cant afford to destroy things now.
remember when games were advertised on tv as being challenges to be conquered  good times. the mantra with games is  git gud  scrub   and its on the person playing to improve their skills and meet the challenge by trying again until they succeed  and practice. its how you get better at anything in life.
elden ring was alright  but not really hard so much as it has a learning curve. thatsaid  I found the community very disappointing as it was supposed to be the  git gud  scrub!  community  not the  please nerf everything I dont use  community. normies are the norm... as in the overwhelming majority and those most willing to pay to win. as soon as anything becomes mainstream  death and stagnation is inevitable. thats just capitalism meeting corporatism. not saying socialism doesnt suck  it does   but every system has its weak point and normies are capitalisms.personally  though  Im more of a factorio guy. story can be good  I love geneforge   but unique mechanics  like depths of peril diplomacy system  and a challenge to overcome is what makes a game for me.
the steelers! !
I dont get the whole you have to like everything I like or we cant be friends thing.  that is just stupid.   as for being humbled by games  I grew up nintendo hard.  the rush and reward is all the more sweeter when you grind the hell out of it and win finally.  that is why I game.  dont get me wrong I like my fair share of creative easy games but those fall under the catagory of puzzle games.  I dont put money into them.  if you are charging me almost 60  for a game I better be able to play it for a long time and it better have a good difficulty standard because  omg why   is my normal.  I play everything on hardest difficulty.  when they started implementing difficulties.  I remember when you got one game mode and that was it.  dark souls games are in my to play list that being said.  I want to do a run through on them fairly soon.  right now I am sort of buried in breath of the wild.
1st twitter comment is mad capping about not liking dying on elden ring but he says he loves competitive games like apex. bruh all you do on apex is die from the smallest mistakes
elden ring is an amazing game.   from software create immersive games actually worth playing.     I cannot stand the vast majority of games today..  and thatsucks for me. I still buy these games hoping they ve changed..   rarely do I ever experience the  flow state  in any of the games today. far too many developers dont understand what gaming should entail. milquetoasted generic gaming..  its copy and paste.. filler garbage thats uninteresting..  bad writing.. shyt characters..  corny storylines..  ruining immersive gameplay by annoying waypointing..  show dont tell  -- it doesnt mean showing a line directly to an objective or piece of content developed in the game..  you d know this if you understood what crafting an immersive experience was like.   Im not simply speaking of immersive rpgs  or strictly open world games.. because this formula can work in many genres   --its really unfortunate what s happened to sony..   years ago they made a lot more games.   its unbelievable that ubisoft has the amount of employees that they do.. yet they continue to push out these same games every year.  you also have the countless other studios trying to copy the ubisoft and bethesda games..   imo its unbearable.
modern aaa games have a lot of problems. cutscenes are not something special anymore. the player often is treated like an idiot. storys think they are smarter than they are enviroment design went down the toilette  so you need that 1 4 of the screen filled up by the minimap a lot of games feel like the same game with a different colorpalet.all the woke stuff and war on everything nice included I hate that as well.personaly when it comes to original releases  no remasters dont count   that dont feel like the same as 90  of the geren I can count those on one hand. now Imostly stick to indie games double a games and twin stick shooters. or replaying metal gear rising  revengance.
get the Bible on audio  the one I got has 5 min segments so its not a huge commitment.
ehh. feel like you are just the opposite of what you claim to hate. while there are those who exclusively like games with pretty graphics you paint any game with great graphics and cutscenes story as s movie. if I want to watch a movie I ll do exactly that on netflix. got of tsushima horizon   ff7r all are great games  with cutscenes great story and great gameplay. you can also have more gameplay focused games like returnal sifu kena. and the upcoming project eve or black myth wukong. tired of people complaining on both sides saying all games today just hold your hand unless made by fromsoft and the people thatsay sekiro and returnal need easy modes
I literally stopped playing video games. Ive been a gamer for 40 years. I haven t bought a game for over two years. I let my gamepass subscription expire. my xbox is now for watching netflix. I play arknights on my phone but thats it. I dont need them. they need me. but Im out.
I get all the thinking I want when rpgs have a deep story and fallow the road of d d. stop making trying to make every rpg into a action adventure platform game.the reason people got recked in diablo 1 and 2 is because they never bothered to level up or learn how to spec there character. same with bg1 and bg2 and so on kotor was not easy either because it forced people to understand the talents and forced people to you know read and understand what members worked good together.same with fainl fantasy elder scrolls   etc. but who wants that in an rpg no we should learn how to dodge and block a mobs. thats what really gamers do. not this leveling crap that takes hours and hours and is part of the joy of rpgs. not the story which is part of the joy. no that is not important.
@evacody124  I think you missed my point entirely. what Imeant was that older school games made you think and plan you moves and were not very forgiving when you planned poorly. thus there was more satisfaction in beating them and finding the secrets    looking at ultima 1-6 and the old runequest games I use to enjoy playing . the newer games rarely have secrets anymore. you want that locked character 5  dlc  you want a bunch of cars you could spend hours unlocking... 15  and we will just give them to you. keep getting your butt kicked by this monster... either a skip option appears or they prompt you to lower the difficulty. I am not saying either method is bad but the game franchise has gotten a lot more hand holdy and less go find the answers yourself or from a friend on how to solve that challenge.
yeah that get good is for sports and fighting games. rpgs are not sports and fighting games. have you ever played d d  any game master that made the campaign hard to the point that the group could not finish was not a good game master. they were just a dick that no one would sit down with to run a game with d d.
the whole point of an rpg is that as I level up my character and get new spells and powers I should be like a God to all the lower level bosses and trash. if thats not what happens then what the heck is the point skill based player. thats not how rpgs work.
@evacody124  having played video games for over 30 years  I come from an age of gaming where difficulty was the norm  no matter what genre you played  rpgs included  especially ones where enemies scale with your level . either you figure out how to properly play a game  or you fail at beating it. simple as that.
um they do depending on the game. rpgs are not ment to be hardcore impossible to finish. you want megaman. and if you want even more hardcore then that go play a fighting game or sports game.stop trying to turn ever rpg into a hardcore ultra extreme game.
you dont seem to understand why they have the minImap or quest log do you  go play bg1 or bg2 that amount of notes you will be taking will drive you up the wall.the reason they added those is so that you dont have to use a pen and paper to take notes any more. it then frees you to enjoy the story  and game play of an rpg. if you want to keep notes with pen and paper then go play table top d d. giving hard-core fans of rpgs quest logs marks and minImap helps clear thatstuff up. oh wait you think it hand holding. the only hand holding is that you dont have a skill or talent tree for souls like games or much reading or cut scenes because they had to dumb it down for adhd people like you.I would love to see you play a game like icewind dale or path of exlie. you would be so lost on how to spec a character. heck you would be lost on where to go in icewind dale.
looks like youre just assuming  wrong . thats on you not me. I greatly enjoyed hzd and ghost of tsushima. I still count them flawed in a lot of ways though but overall really enjoyed them.
people are so tired of being held by hand through-out entire games  that they re complaining about the  admittedly fun   interesting  tutorial hours of pokemon legends arceus. a game thats designed to be accessible as someone s first pok mon game.
perhaps people wouldn t get  butt hurt  if you didn t insult them.  calling them  participation trophy  people is clearly insulting.  you are a youtube influence   if your opinions didn t matter to people  you wouldn t have a base  so Im surprised you dont understand how your opinion can matter.   isn t that why your here     I dont understand why you cant see people would be annoyed when you are using a clearly derogatory term for them like that.    you can enjoy your games and not bring other people down by being insulting.   personally  I suck at games now. im freaking old enough to be your dad.  my time is severely limited so I want to play a game that I can advance the story  time being so precious to me.    I disagree with your opinion about these games not having substance  its jus that I doesnt have substance you like.
the scripture teaches that you are entitled. you by no effort of your own have access to heaven. you have eternal salvation because of something Jesus did. how is that not entitled
is anita snarkessian still a thing ! ! !
I was rally into the whole cinematic game aesthetic at first  and I still like the cinematic look  dof  chromatic aberration  motion blur  the whole nine yards   but when games started becoming movies  with hand holding  poor gameplay and mechanics...thats when that kind of game philosophy pushed me away and lost me. games should be good games before they are anything else. and no amount of cinematic bells and whistles can save a bad game. its still a bad game.
nope in this cases its whining.  why do you care how someone plays a single player game this is not madden  nhl nba2k  wwe2k  mortal kombat  street fighter. its a single player rpg. ask yourself why the biggest names in rpgs are skyrim  witcher 3 and final fantasy  because the makers respect the fact they are single player games and ever one has different skill levels.stop pushing for extreme hard pvp mod in single player games.if I wanted that I would play eve online or call of duty. which call of duty sucks these days because they took away the fact that it was a single player. if you have this many issues with someone not playing a game the way you want it played thats a you issue.
one milion in june!!
I hated the witcher 3...I hated skyrim...cutscenes are stupid...elden ring is great for me...its so tough that when youre a dumb casual like me and get past a boss you feel great...I love it!
on a more serious note  I think you ll probably appreciate this video from lauren southernhttps   youtu.be ug0ywzs6pmk
its the same thing with a lot of movies now. pretty to look at but no substance to come back to after the first time.
you just came from somewhere important im guessing  from your hair.anywho I think youre the only one that integrates scripture without being forced. Jesus said he will knock and whoever hears his voice and opens will eat with him.

politics  in the age of  personal is political  political is personal   get views.
achievment get you have instaled gamekids these day can barely function irl without  objective markers
people nowadays cant play nes battletoads they wouldn t get through 1st level lmao tbh I rather play a game that kicks my ass than a gamemovie
0 00  whats up boomers.  does that mean bernie sanders is welcome
cool
you dont gain anything from shitting on people who dont like the things you like. this is coming from a dark souls stan.
the problem is younger people seem to have to much adhd and just want to fight everything. they dont want to read or watch a story. which is what make about 80  of an rpg amd rpg.
people dont know how bad I would want to play dark souls  yet those same people whine because the game is too hard for them  talk about over privileged.
am I one of the few people who think dark souls games are not that hard...
are you 35 years old!
fromsoft games are for chads. been back on a project brutality binge again myself.
most aaa games are now made for ignorants who get offended by a challenge.
you mean fake gamers
you look more like 20 years old
I like the message but Im just a bit confused at the ending. how do youremain a Christian and still play video games  seems like it kinda  buck up against each other in a bad way.
I dont like souls games  not because of the difficulty but because I dont like the gameplay. but every time I say I dont like souls game I swear every single fan of those games just tells me gid gud assuming I dont like the game just because I suck at it. I actually like difficult games  for example one of my fav games of all times is the darkest dungeon  sure its not as difucult as souls games but its far from an easy game. souls games have one of the more toxic fanbase.
all this shit is a fad. I wouldn t worry about it. because before things like assassins creed it was some nes game that had billions of hidden content and no one could figure any of it out and none of the games gave you any hits.it ll change in time and a lot of it will be more varied. besides there s options in assassins creed to turn off way points.
do these uneducated   inexperienced sadists play any of these games  hell no
personnaly breath of the wild killed zeldalol  no dungeon  just small sidequest puzzles. if the new tomb raiders are the easy mod old school tomb raider  well breath of the wild is the same for zelda series
were youreally surprised he blocked you  in today s sad pampered woke society you should ve expected it.
yes well Im a member of the participation crowd now but not by choice. fucking nerve damage and arthritis. so excuse me for wanting to still enjoy a game at lower difficulties. been gaming since 1995 and gate keeping in any form is low.
why bother with youtube and not shift over to one of the newer platforms staying on youtube is like helping to fund your own oppression.
like I said the last episode.I blame feminism.  you take out traditional roles and think everyone should get equity.
finally found something about you I dislike........steelers   really
story games like heavy rain  they re not games they have no gameplay  they re interactive movies and bad ones at that
dont know why youre mad about the cinematic aspect of gaming. with all the money I spend on my pc I expect that to be a big part of gaming. that has nothing to do with the difficulty of gaming. I never found tomb raider all that fun. final fantasy on the other hand consumed way too much of my life. under water soccer anyone
eww the steelers.
my uploads are synced to other platforms like rumble. simply stated  youtube has a way larger audience and I get insurmountably more traction here than elsewhere
@melonie mac go boom   fair enough  I just think youtube has abandoned its original charge in the way it is currently acting. anyhow  I hope your video s dont get drowned out to all the mainstream channels youtube blankets in my homepage.
its not only feminism fault  its people s fault who dont understand things
because many of the people that complain about it have never really played rpg games  they will say they have  but they never really  did.and if they have they will go I just skipped over the story because I just want to fight things. so fromsoft comes a long and gives them what they want a dumbed down story and dumbed down rpg that is just a action adventure platform game with no talent or skill tree or understanding of different classes etc.because who wants to take the time to learn what skills and talents to pick for a ranger or hear the deep story of say dragonage or kotor or what have you. that just gets in the way of dodge  jump  roll  block  attack git gud. dark souls fans  why do I need to learn a talent tree  why do I need to learn about skilltrue rpg fans  because that how you get good and level up.
@evacody124  yea thing is people expect to be able to use whatever character or skills etc and be good at it. thats not how it works. although some of that fault I think lies on gamers. with sites like maxroll that give you the optimized setups so you do zero work in learning or experimenting. all attention is focused on the endgame nowadays or multi-player. for a true gamer there is as much satisfaction in the journey as the end. either way game developers are gonna make what sells and I guess I get that to an extent.
people that protest your comment about being weaksauce gamers are outing themselves as weaksauce gamers.  just an observation.  the warrior has spoken.
