race swap white protagonists for black or other minority  do the shittiest adaptation possible   claim that all criticism towards the adaptation is actually because people are racist   have wokies sjws backing you up and attacking the fanbase  instant shield against criticismthats how it works now with adaptations
its always the reboot fans. - melonieabsolutely correct. in most brands  fanbases.star trek  star wars  dr who  halo  etc  etc  the worst fans are the newest ones who think the modern garbage is what these properties are supposed to be.
only if they want it to flop like  batwoman  then I say go for it.
imagine being this delusional to think your raced swapped character that everyone hated is anywhere near comparable to lara croft
I always believed in keeping the creators original vision. changing lara crofts look would be like giving permission to some random  artist   and they take some play-doh  and put boobs on the statue of david. you either keep the original beauty that was going through the creators mind  or you destroy it by mangling it with someone who understands nothing.
when someone says its no big deal when they race change a character to be black ask them      if its no big deal let s leave the character the original race then  of course they wont stand for that.
like they say   once you go black  you never go back .  if she were to be cast as lara croft  lara would forevermore be a woman of color.  she would never be caucasian again.  Ive never seen in any form of entertainment where a character has been raceswapped from white to a poc and had them eventually go back to being white.  as for the argument that people use where they say  they re not real   how do they justify raceswapping anne boleyn   she was a real woman.
instead of replacing the skin color of established characters why not create new one s   lara croft is the latest to be tokanized
being the  star  of batwoman is like being the star of abject failure.
I just want lara to be lara.I feel like Im not asking for much but what do I know.
since there s nothing mutually exclusive about being vegan and Christian  congratulations  vegan youtuber   you just alienated a potential part of your audience. youre like hollywood without the fame  money or superficial glamour. meanwhile  melonie continues to have the most even-handed takes and best audience interaction Ive seen from a youtuber in a while. keep it up  mel!
she says her power works yet her show got cancelled because of an extremely low amount of views   a ton of criticism and nobody knew who she was before that when it came to acting   I am sure most ppl still dont know who she is. no sweet clue how the show lasted as long as it did. I want an athletic white british woman to play as lara because lara is an athletic white british woman. you are going to pass those nutrition classes with flying colors  mel   I am happy that you are finally taking them  you got dis! its always good to have something to fall back on.
I admire your passion for lara croft way to go melanie
society wants to demonize discipline  -  so well said!
Imean she  can  be the next lara croft...but I wont go see it.just like im not going to see  girl thor sick of all the race gender swaps
with how melonie feels about tomb raider  is how I feel about star wars! so I understand melonie s frustration with her favorite property being so mismanaged.
lara croft is more real to me than most real people are.  wow  thats pretty intense.
I am british and old enough to remember buying the first tomb raider game back in the 1990s.  I played that game to death on the ps1 and loved it.  I also remember the big controversy when  the then unheard of  angelina jolie was cast as lara croft in the movie because she was american and not upper class english.  we were all outraged they would ruin lara croft making her an american in the movie.I was against some yankie putting on a bad english accent and ruining this amazing character.... I was wrong   angelina jolie nailed it! she looked the part  she did her research and did a great job pulling this character off.the difference between angelinas controversy and this controversy is that angelina looked exactly like the character  she only had to nail the accent. this new girl looks nothing like lara!!!! and no amount of acting skill will fix that problem.
I know you said you didn t mind the titans starfire casting in thatsituation  and youre welcome to your opinion   but my thoughts there were similar to your thoughts here. if they weren t going to  paint  her skin  then cast someone whose skin is tone is at least close to korI s.
I got a neck ache from the amount of times I nodded in agreement with this video. also  what you said about entertaining sin at the end of this video hit home for me. thanks for delivering that message  as I realize now I was veering in that direction a little bit and I need to straighten up before that leads somewhere bad.
I would even say assassin s creed.
@dying rose  insert look how they massacred my boy  shaun  meme
what makes you think they are fans. they are just there for the politics and 2 weeks later they cant even mention a single character anymore and are off to be a  new fan  of some other franchise that gone woke. they are parasites  not fans.
agreed! I ll never not play halo now and hear  master cheeks  instead of master chief.
warhammer 40k has all-but been rebooted since fall of cadia too. all the identity and uniqueness stripped away.
exactly.
re  daviddo not give them any ideas.
yep that pretty much explains modern entertainment to the t
you dont believe that cause the original vision was a video game and therefore should stay a video game.
this is acting  calm yourself.
@lilmovieperp  they re just trying to bullshit themselves into believing they aren t reactionary.
@mr. marc g.  lol   as soon as I read this I rushed to say just that!
@sheevino palpatino  we re trying to kid ourselves that youre human.
its not a big deal for them until a black character is swapped for a white one  then it ll be instant crying
according to their logic Im still waiting on a movie with an asian mlk
@styro foam  lol
well said
@knox2don  anyone remember what nick fury used to look like  the mcu fans probably dont even know what Im talking about.
not to argue but wanted to point out that white people have portrayed poc in film for a long time. cleopatra is the first thatsprings to mind and then lots of native american people in old westerns
wokeism is lazy. no originality required.
how hard is it to just make her an original character called shun quesha jones.
exactly this. this right here. give established characters of colour the spotlight or create fantastic new ones.
@jedimasta yoda  why do you have to racist about it
batwoman is the raj branston of superheroes.
she s not gonna marry you  dude
@lilmovieperp
well what would be the purpose of a mask and costume  if we recognize batwoman on the street  she s missing the point
neither jolie nor vikander are native british  but they atleast pass as such. thatshould be the bare minimum goal when you cast a character.
thats  mighty  girl thor
there is a girl thor in the comics. they re not gender swapping.
@mandosaur  yes I know...worst run ever..no one liked it. lol
@jsbphotorebel  everyone liked it . mighty thor been a character
@chris grande  not what the sales numbers say lol
@jsbphotorebel  they said its good
well at that time the pixeled lara croft honestly was shaped  like minecraft block constructl in the game  except her bewbs
@styro foam  hey youngling  go search for tomb raider 1996 cuts scenes and come back and delete your comment. lara had curves in the cut scenes and angelina was damn close to the cgI cutscene lara at the time.
how d you feel about alicia vikander in the 2018 movie
@bomber 44  angelina jolie was better
now thats a reach. korI is yellow. cheeto yellow. shes not even human  move.
if they didn t paint her skin why does it matter thatshes black. the character is an alien not human. they could have used a mix raced actress to play starfire but they didn t and it didn t change the plot of the show at all.
@chris grande  I d say her exact skin tone depends on the media and the inker. sometimes her skin tone is more orange bronze than yellow  which looks more like a human person s skin tone . but Imean  to be fair  if you look at a color wheel there are skin tones closer to starfire s skin tone than anna diop s  nothing against her personally  obviously . some people literally call certain skin tones  yellow   even though they technically aren t.and the  not even human  argument isn t very strong either. if snoopy was put in live-action  you wouldn t expect him to be a dalmation or a st. bernard or a golden retriever because thats not what he looks like. you wouldn t expect clifford the big red dog to be blue  pink  or purple. what did people say about sonic s original live-action design and he still had lots of what you d expect sonic to look like  I have no issue with anna diop being in the cast. why not cast her as rocket  an original black character who was a sidekick to icon  they were both in young justice   or bumblebee  she simply doesnt look like starfire. thats my only point.
@m h  Imean  of course it wont change the plot. if Im writing a story and I call eggs  toast  and toast  eggs   and I write every character to do that too  the story will proceed as I wrote it. its simply about the portrayal to the audience. its the same reason they didn t make starfire an old  fat man. its further away from what starfire is established to be and look like. if it didn t bother you or some others  thats fine obviously. generally the more you like a character  the more you want a character to look and feel the way they ve been portrayed when they appear in other media. its similar to the way melonie feels about lara croft s portrayals in media. she wants her to have the look  personality  and even height to reflect the character s original portrayals and what she fell in love with about the character.
I officially declare myself the next brad pitt while we re calling things. or shrek. whatever s available.
you are absolutely right that why I liked angelina jolie as lara croft so much. she really captured the  essence of lara croft so well and the movie was just build like the games.  I just rewatched it and wish that the had made more movies. the beauty and the flaw in tom raider lara croft is that there is littel continuity in the story and between games .
your comment about  treating yourself  is totally on point. its fine if its actually a treat and doesnt become a habit. Ive often found myself indulging in too many  treats  and wondering why my scale was giving me the middle finger. had to make some major changes  intermittent fasting  changed up my workout routine  took your advice and started shifting to more meat  to get back on track with my fitness goals. seeing good results but it required cutting out many of the  treats  that I had let become habits.
if lara aint real and can be black  how about white tchalla   white shaft  white blade  luke cage I guess all fine right
she can have her own superhero called  the franchise destroyer
she reminds me of the original concept art where like lara had a bra and pants and duals. a reboot would have to be needed but that would be cool if we got maybe another tr timeline with this actress voicing her! they could totally do a bad ass tr spin-off! maybe like reimagining the gameboy tr games.
make a movie inspired by lara croft and be remembered for being a good actress not race swap  or be a voice actress for an animated movie.
couldn t agree more with your arguments melonie. this whole race-swapping   gender-swapping craze is stupid  because they want to make the character in question completely unrecognizable  but still call them by the same because of the fame attached it. its reaaaaaally lazy
melonie should be the next lara croft!!!
this is why Im not super duper harsh on the reboot design  because this shows how her design can get alot worse in today s world of wokeness.
anya taylor joy is the actress your thinking about. she s very talented  so outside of the traditional looking croft I think she could pull off lara croft with some training.
she can do lara croft the day I see a white black panther.
I want melonie to be the next lara croft.
lara croft isn t real  but will lose their minds if you make her look more feminine or wear shorts
well there s another beloved character down the tubes  riplaracroft she will be missed
rhona mitra  for  tomb raider!where s a petition!would be perfect casting imo!
I think tom holland looked like kid nathan drake just not adult nathan. I think its extremely difficult to find someone who looks like the character and a great actor. even harder if its an athletic role or character. there is usually a give and take somewhere. I do believe there is a limit thought to how far off the look is in more iconic characters unless time and a really good and likable actor is there like daniel craig  james bond   samuel l  nick fury   jeffrey wright  commissionergordon .
2 20 that argument u said there is what dedicated percy jackson book fans recently have been trying to say to explain their distaste for the disney adaption casting but have been accused racist instead  including by the author  that manipulative jerk
lara isn t real neither is black panther
the problem with race swapping lara croft is that it doesnt simply change the color of her skin. it changes the color of her parents skin. her entire lineage and family history. the crofts are titled  they have a deep history in england. so race swapping is not simply  diversifying  a character  it is re-writing her entire life  her history  her family s life and history and the interactions each have had with others.the reason that race swapping a character like nick fury gets less blowback is that  while yes it re-writes decades of interactions  very little is known about his life  his family and history. luke skywalker cant be asian because that changes anakin  padme  leia  shmI  and all of the children of luke and leia. and if you start re-writing history to account for a race change  all you ve done is created a new character wearing an established character s name tag.
its a one-way street with these people.
black panther I d say is not a great example  but youre exactly right  everyone else on the list is true. blade actually came up in a conversation I was having about race swaps and Imade a point saying what if blade was race swapped since race has never been integral to his character in terms of origin  it d be a dumb decision to do and not needed  so why do it to classically white characters   what I got back was  his race is important   even though blade stated to luke  when youre undead as long as I have been  race doesnt count for much - blade  some people just love to virtue signal lol.
technically there is lol his name is white wolf
@cryptic cavern  yeah  but there s no film about him.
she s 45. if this was 10 years ago  I would say hell yeah. but Im not too sure now.
I love rhona mitra but wouldn t she be pushing it a bit age wise
that... actually sounds perfect. I never would have thought of her.
well  it could be a fun movie if she was mentoring a new tomb raider  like she was going to the mask of zorro.better to make them 2 new tomb raider so they can play with the weaknesses and strengths of both.
@the man from dystopia   I would pay to see a more seasoned  experienced lara croft  thats me.
@jos  ximeno  so lara croft jr.
its amazing how young you look melanie!
Ive seen vegans bully this one ex vegan  because he stopped being vegan  for at least a year  until I quit watching his videos   in every video he made his comments section was full of angry vegans being violent and abusive. I ll never trust a vegan after that.
to quote hans olo   over my dead body
lara croft is an english aristocrat who has been canonically depicted as being white and selfcentred  she is also very active in her endeavours when going after various artifacts. in fact I imagine thatshe has quite the criminal record for grave robbing and desecration of scared site as well as her unbelieveable bodycount and acts of violence against endangered animals  lara is quite the problematic character and making her black wont changed any of that.
nice overlay you have in your setup    the pink lighting adds a new flare that is impressive
let s not make a bad actress lara croft
look melonie if you somehow get them to cast the kingpin as laura croft. Im taking you to the premier.
next on  how to kill a franchise
I almost feel bad for these actors...  its got to bother them knowing some of the are chosen because  well  you know despite their talent level and fit for the role at hand.
if laura croft was an ice cream flavor with swirls of chocolate and butterscotch in vanilla with coffee chocolate relics in it  and marshmallow sarcophagus  I would totally eat it. why aren t they doing that
hayley. atwell.live-action lara croft perfection.
I know who youre talking about. anya taylor-joy  I would actually like to see her play lara croft  but it does make sense why she shouldn t but I like her  becoming a fan of hers.
isn t alicia vikander in the next movie
fans of the books were furious that tom cruise was playing jack reacher because apparently jack reacher is like 6 4 .
me at 10 57 - wasn t itsomeone like goku who said something to the effect of   I guess name calling is your only real attack - because youre too weak to challenge me any other way  that to me sounds like alot of your critics - melonie  you said it best when you said  you eat what you want  I ll eat what I want  debate done!  keep going and go boom
yeah if lara is not real I want the rock to be the new lara and become larry croft the new adventure
and for the umpteenth time  I repost this quote   it is the mark of insanity to do the same thing over and over again and expect different results.   -- albert einstein
thats all we need now...laqueesha croft...
the batwoman writing staff stated as much as  it was good because it had a black gay woman in the lead.  itsounded like they put all their effort into casting and didn t leave much for little things like writing  and I think most fans care more about the latter than the former.
preach the good word  melonie  about the faith and against the vegan cultists. I personally dont subscribe to the all meat all vegetable diets  but thats what works for me. I love my potatoes too much   probably. I ll never tell people what to eat  but like you  I can advise on what works for me. these vegan types can be extremely vitriolic to anyone thatspeaks against their  truth   and it does no one any good.have a good day.from a fellow tattooed Christian. p.s. continuing to pray for you  and also love your hair.
typical cult behavior. cultist tend to go after other ex-cultists when they leave the cult.
meh
my brother didn t believe the rdj thing but then he looked him up and this is the exact quote from him  oh damn
this was just an attempt to let people know there s  still is  a batwoman tv show. assuming its somehow still around. I starred in this show no one watched  but had wokeism dollars to keep it afloat  so  Imust be a good actor!
its more like she s saying Im unemployed someone give me a job! will do superhero stuff for food!
seems like a good british accent would be absolutely essential for any lara. barring a reboot game  which would take years to produce  Im hoping there isn t any need for a new lara to be cast.
well I get the same when I grew up with doctor who. watched it for 50 years as a white british male  and then they go and change it to a woman  and now they have changed him black. Imean I love characters such as spawn and blade  but I wouldn t change them white.
I laughed. because her saying she s gonna be the next lara croft is so stupid its hilarious.
itsays a lot about the current state of society that you have to make a long video explaining and giving reasonable arguments to  why fans just want something faithful to the source material  instead of injected politics  expectation subversion and  redesigns  of what they once loved. itsays even more than despite the arguments making all sense in the world  the people who pushes the opposite ideas will not give a cr p and will call you racist anyway. they say they want to  stop racism  and yet they make everything about race. actually sad. anyway  keep up the good tomb raider work melonie.
if this were to actually happen I really hope it fails.
and its not just the fact thatshe doesnt look like her  their are a lot of actors out there who would fit the role much better. I compare it to brie larson wanting to be samus in a metroid movie  even though she kind of looks like her she would not make a good samus.
keep it up!
they really going after our beloved characters huh
I agree about accounts and channels that want to broadcast and be heard  but disable comments.  itseems hypocritical and narcissistic to want everyone to hear them  but they dont want to listen in return.  if you dont want to interact  then dont broadcast in the first place.
in the ideal situation at the full moon and when all planets are lined  up maybe she could pool it of.  d
I like how nothing was learned from the failure of the batwoman show
the sad truth is that there is high possibility we wont have lara croft anymore as her popularity declined so much
reads title and starts laughing
na  you cant put the girl who got batwoman cancelled into something thatstill has so many dedicated fans. if I could cast anyone  I would consider mel  she s clearly modelled herself on the character to some point.only three problems with melonie being lara though first thing is I dont know exactly how tall she is  but if youre looking at og tomb raider melonie I d say would come out a little shorter  but you dont need to tick every single box with an adaption. the second thing is I dont think she s tried a posh british accent but also doesnt sound like she d have a convincing one  I could be wrong about that though. again Im talking about how og lara sounded and not the more american reboots third problem  we re gonna have to explain why a british archaeologist who fights tigers and dinosaurs has a big tattoo of herself
if she wasn t popular enough to save batwoman  what drugs did these people take to make them think she d make a good lara croft
I wanna play the next shaft and Im going to own it. ive a gaelic slavic background with big tash and big hair.
tom holland and mark wahlberg look nothing like nathan s drake and sully  but they somehow made a successful film. thats probably just because of their star power though.

you know  they could create a badass african archeologist that investigate ancient african ruins  focusing in african history. I dont understand how those people are so obsessed about afro this  afro that  but they just refuse to make anything legit african! they rather shoehorn black female vikings  than write anything about the ahosI  the dahomey amazons.
I always thought if she could have done a british accent  young sophia vergara could have been a great lara croft.
I am a fan of the reboots and the alicia vikander lara.too bad the last movie took a different route then the games  probably to please the audience instead of following the lore.the main reason for liking the reboots is thatshe is not a immortal super woman that can handle everything with ease.
since the character changed voice actors many times over the years  if she got the talent for it I wont mind her voicing lara in the next game but as a live action  hell no
thats funny thats just like how they were up in arms when gail gadot said she wanted to play cleopatra and they made a mountain out of a molehill saying but you have to be egyptian to play cleopatra like come on man give me a break
this is what a lot of fans have said and why they haven t wanted things like a black catwoman or a black superman. and it even goes into the cartoons when the whole identity of the character is changed like with halo in young justice. the wokeys are basically looking to change the character into something they re not just so that they can  show it to whitey .
Im not a betting man  but I d not be surprised if the only thing she s manifesting in 3 years is someone s burger order...
reminds me of when showrunners completely bastardized the wheel of time series. I understand this happens all the time in the name of equity and inclusion   idk wtf those are . I actually didn t have an issue with season 1  but season 2 is where I draw the line as a rj fan. simply put  aiel aren t black.
impressive how this haircut reshapes your face. lovely.
hey melonie I just want to say that  the batwoman actress javicia leslie wouldn t be a good person to play laura croft in the new tomb raider movie. anyway I think thatshe will not be that great and I think that they need to find someone else to play laura croft part in the next tomb raider movie  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and make a comment to your video  ok melonie. anyway I hope you had a great day today and I hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too  ok melonie. anyway have a great evening and good night melonie.
the way that hollywood is right now the next lara croft will be played by brie larson and mark ruffalo will be cast as some sort of male feminist ally who apologizes for everything masculine throughout the movie. their press junkets will be the two of them calling anyone who doesnt like her portrayal as misogynistic and having  toxic masculinity.
and right now the little girl in melonie is going
what these dolts dont seem to understand is the difference between an established character and an unestablished one. established characters have not only defining  but set features  such as lara  samus  aloy etc. they have specific features that distinguish them from  say npcs  although this concept expands  beyond video games  into tv and movies as well. why not instead make a new adventure character where the lead is a black woman  what s wrong with that  it would be something new as apposed to the need for blackwashing.
Im okay with it as long as we can get a white john stuart
lara was one of the first actually.her original design has been altered to make her less sexy but idiots are never content until they destroy everything they see and think is  wrong .
she s just reaching for any kind of publicity to keep her in the public eye - because she was unknown before batwhamen  during batwhamen  and now she s in danger of being really becoming unknown again.Imean  I d rather just keep alicia vikander.
they absolutely will flip if black panther gets race swapped  but albert wesker or lara croft being race swapped is totally fine for them. the double standards hurt.
melonie is the best...possibly even better.
no. dont give them anything.  well maybe she would be a great lara if she-  no. thats how the woke movement got this far in the first place. too many people giving them an inch over little things. whether they are mistaking your kindness for weakness or they are truly lost in the sauce of society  they will ruin your favorite franchises. give them nothing.
so she isn t lara croft.
there s so many african myths and stories they could get into and explore too which I would go see but they wont do that
as someone who loves stories from across the world  this done right would be great.
that takes creativity  which these hacks dont have.
they re lazy  untalanted and spiteful. thats why they blackwash instead of creating new characters.
I prefer to create new character as opposed to changing the ethnicity of existing characters.
kate siegel should be the next lara!!!
uhm  isn t everything real  like  just bc I cant grab the wind doesnt change the fact that it can blow me away. just bc I cant hang with lara doesnt mean I cant be affected by the things she s done. there are many things that are definitely real  even if they cant be physically held. if we re being realistic  the term  real  shouldn t even exist  because almost everything anyone canthink of is real in some way  even if its just as a manifestation in their head. also  I find it really funny to hear  its not real  from a bunch of whiners who cry about how that  not real  thing is  misogynistic . like  pick a lane or stay 700 miles away from me .
tom cruise playing a 6 6  jack reacher.      honestly though  I think she could play lara craft  wouldn t phase me at all.  I was sceptical when in the battlestar galactica remake they made starbuck a woman  but it worked out.
pictures 600lb male dressed like lara croft trying to climb ledges and cliffs and such...  immediately dies of laughter
also  lara speaks with a british accent  so a british actress would be most appropriate.
Im not 600lbs but I think I would be a great lara croft
I personally feel like cheat days aren t for me. or at the very least  Imost definitely need to go super easy on it because after eating muh beef and eggs for so long  that grain crap makes me feel like I poisoned myself. because I did.
cain was vegan  and abel ate meat.   and thats how it all started.
star of batwoman  is quite the stretch.
I feel like no one will pick her to be any incarnation of lara croft wether that be for the movies  games  or upcoming anime series cuz batwoman was a flop  she doesnt even look like lara croft in the same way alicia vikander does  and she couldn t pull off a british accent at all cuz her acting in batwoman was mid at best and also if this does happen then the fans are gonna hate and tear her apart. also saying that a fictional character thatsomeone loves isn t real is stupid and hurtful to people who really love the character and only want what s best for them.
imagine if you made a white blade
hImelonie I just wanted say thank you for sharing your thoughts onBible scriptures.takecare melonie
hey melonie  Imet Jesus--- in person! did you  what did he look like for you  for me he was a stoner skater guy but he had a mexican blanket type of shawl  red  covering all of the scars  he couldnt move normally  he was injured  but still  floated  around with grace
so after failing as batwoman  a show no one watched and is now cancelled   she now she wants to fail as lara croft
if there was any dark skinned woman that could pull off lara croft granted if she was slightly younger it would be rosario dawson. she s got the acting chops and definitely the figure. this chick that plays bat woman is cute but way too short and cant even act her way  out of a paper bag but then again she s reading bad scripts off of the crappy show runners of the show.
the grain brain  dang girl no mercy huh
its time for video game lara without actors to come back. old school animations and physics  most of them unrealistic but fun.
had to laugh at batwoman being the tomb raider.     seems like selena gomez   or someone like her   would match the og lara.   however  I would prefer unknown   little-known actors and actresses to play famous characters.   but she really fits the bill.   people claim to be real fans of the original shows  starwars  star trek  halo  etc.  then rip out the parts that identify the franchise.  just find the experts and scholars that agree with the new vision ... poof!   sadness.  and if you want to make people really uncomfortable at a party   drink water.   people will constantly offer to get you a drink!   so unsettling for social drinkers.   p
you know who looks like lara croft  the one who acts like lara croft. she doesnt have to be white just be good at her role. the last tomb raider movie is a good example about why having a good actress matters more.
Christian bale played batman.
heavily criticized for his cartoonishly melodramatic voice
man dude  Im gonna be lara croft too  just watch me!
omg same. it takes me about two weeks to recover from the inflammation. I prefer just to eat keto as my cheat days because I usually dont react negatively to keto  carbs and high oxalate veggies are my biggest issue
the grain brain. I love that nickname for vegans. hope you dont mind if I use it. new boomer by the way. love the honesty even though I dont always agree. its refreshing.
go for it. I like saving money.
I always find it weird when someone wants to debate over a different opinion on the internet   Imean   why do you think I have to go out of my way to try and convince you of something   I dont even know you   what makes you think you are so important that  a stranger would need your approval
lara croft is now lashawnda croft
if she does get the role   the next snow white cast  a ginger  scandinavian  should play mlk
she destroyed batwoman and now she want destroy lara . never!
its all about diluting   devaluing iconic charactors. a character looses its identity   uniqueness if there s a black one  a gay one  a gender swapped one etc. same with the current trend with multiverses.
did you track down the french graphic novel that came out before the top cow run.
I rarely take reboot fans seriously  since most of them are activist. plus reboot fans hardly supported their beloved reboots  cause the rebooted comics  movies and merchs did even worse than the games. I do think a black woman could pull it of  but it has to be done in the way as they did it with maggie q in cw s nikita  halle berry s as cat woman and nicole beharie in sleepy hollow. these 3 ladies werent the o.g. race of these character but it was done right. first of all it wasnt political and the characters were fully developed in line and with respect of the o.g characters  and they were accepted. its clear this actress wouldnt opt for this way.
I dont have a horse in the tomb raider race  but your trashing of reboot fans was hilarious.
raI fx  am I the only one that heard that  scoliosis of the liver  I think he meant cirrhosis liver.
playing tr since 2001. honestly I have zero issues with lara being any ethnicity  as long as we can keep the main visual idea  dark colors  fit body  and of course keep her personality  original background  m.o. etc! I prefer a different ethnicity rather than a caucasian cry baby!
we re gonna need the top batwoman expert in here   az from heelsvsbabyface just to make all sides rrreeeeeeeeeeeee
its not racist to want lara to be played by a white british girl.I dont want either blade to be played by a white guy. thats not racist  thats wanting accuracies to the origins of the character.
I have a great idea! let s have mickey rooney play a chinese man in a movie. aren t we supposed to be leaving that era behind us  I guess if javicia leslie has her way that era of race swapping would still be considered okay.
adds tomb raider to the list of destroyed ips.
one of the most offended casting choice for me was tom cruise as jack reacher. he maybe a great actor but he s an absolute runt compared to jack reacher in the book.
she s called  lara croft  and not sh neyqua  zm l ng z  for God s sake!
still waiting for a white guy to so stunningly and bravely portray mulan.
if it looks like a duck  walks like a duck and quacks like a duck  then fine.its not too much to ask for someone to look somewhat like said chr. james bond for example is easy  as a man just needs to have that kinda look to him  swave  debonair and knows how to wear a suit well  that and the british accent helps  but is not wholey necessary as sean connery proved God rest his soul !I otherwise see the point behind the nathan drake thing  but alas  videogames dont always translate well to the silver screen. tom holland does have the chr though  to make nathan good in film form.as for lara croft herself... angelina jolie is the quintessential live action counterpart. its like she was destined to play the role. as for the most recent film  the actress chosen was good.at the end of the day  all anyone wants is for hollywood to respect the source material  thats all!
thought they needed actors for movies.
we lost chad boseman at a young age to cancer. henry cavil was basically fired from the superman franchise. what would these same people who say race doesnt matter say  or do  if henry cavil were cast to replace chad as the next black panther  just replace any black or hispanic character with a white actor and watch the  race doesnt matter  crowd lose their minds.
melonie seriously you are like torturing me non stop. this savagery first brie than man playing lara  d thanks for putting those images in my mind. where is the bleach.
all acting is pretending to be someone you are not. I dont mind if the actor doesnt look like the character as long as they have the talent to portray the character s personality accurately. I dont get bogged down in appearances. also  I can appreciate how any woman might see herself in lara croft  despite any racial differences  and want to play the character. assuming that is what is going on rather than some form of appropriation. yeah  I know that term is typically used going the opposite way  but I think it can apply to any situation. it depends on the motivation. for example  toxic feminist appropriating male characters to push their own agenda. e.g. feminazI who saying   Ive had an upgrade.
lara croft is also a member of the british aristocracy. if I recall correctly  she s actually a countess. while it is not impossible for a lady to be non-white  it is very unlikely unless they have married into the family. this aspect of the character would be so rare  it would just feel odd for any adaptation to not comment on it at all.
your emphasis on that halo comment!
she s a gorgeous actress and tbh if she was the next lara I wouldn t have a problem as long as she was styled correctly
the voice actress sound brittish.....its    lady croft  after all
I always find it amusing how same people who whine about  diversity  and demand race and gender swapping are the exact same people who will always use exact same rebuttal  character x isn t real  why does it matter   self-awareness is not their strong trait.
you should never be cancelled youre fucking awesome...also fuck having a black woman play lara! its nog racist  lara just ain t black!
I ll be good with this shit when brad pitt plays shaka zulu.
veganism   unhealthyism. there s nothing to debate. being an omnivore whilst getting most of your protein from meat sources is the healthiest option. but vegetables and fruits definitely serve their purpose as well as far as micronutrients. no reason to cut out food groups. just stay away from processed crap and you ll feel great day to day. since it doesnt seem like that particular vegan is very pro-Christian  maybe he can pray to vegetables for better mental health
alicia vikander  come back! we re begging you...
everyone calm down. that woman is not lara croft and has not been cast as lara croft. alicia vikander is still lara and the sequel obsidian is still on standby.leslie is just a tr fan and expressed how she would love to play a cool character like lara. maybe she could get a role as reyes or anaya. who knows
Im okay with it   I guess   they d definitely need to do a lot of makeup but its not impossible to make her look like lara  including lightening her skin.  if they dont  Im out.  the attitude is a bigger thing and the fact thatshe s just going for it like this seems pretty damn croftian to me.  the whole idea that people saying she cant just makes her want to do it more...  yeah  it fits.  I got nothing against actors playing a different skin color  but you have to try with the makeup...  the witcher series having a black triss merigold was extremely jarring and it kind of ruined it for me.  there were plenty of black characters they could have made more prominent if they wanted diversity.  triss is a white girl with red hair  period.
ur literally right
the average light skinned brown woman could pull off lara croft much better than the average european in my opinion due to the attitude brown woman have. I think most americans are too focused on race when judging people because they re just conditioned and brainwashed that way by the culture  Im american myself . for that reason  some people believe that no brown woman in existence could possibly pull off a lara croft no matter how much she resembles lara croft simply because of the difference of a social construct called race. most brown people have brown skin but some brown people actually have skin lighter than the average european.
could anyone who worked on batwoman ever be considered a  star  though
who wants to see the new black panther movie staring brad pitt
bigger lips and tan skin are european features. its called mediterranean. she looks more italian than anything.
we are real fans they cant do that
I dont drink cuz my grandfather on my fathers side lost a 4ish million dollar construction company in the 80s during a poker game  they got him drunk and had him sign over his company.
I love your contentfriday night tights  fnt  got me here!subbed!
I wouldnt be surprised. they were already way of with vikander.
go for it  I say.  she d actually have to work out for that one.  has she seen the last girl that played lara   no costume to cover up those hips.
the second new movie is being made with the same actress. tr did okay in us  but really well on the rest of the planet.
or  what if  she tried doing a robert downey jr and do a white face
batwoman star...  whoa  hold up a minute. batwoman has no stars.
maybe you should sing all comments like you did ben s
noooooooo! please dont the same they re trying to do with ariel and now blue fairy from pinocchio
no.  she ain t going to be lara. she can be storm for all I care.  stop blackwashing and gayifying everything.
if they race bend lara I would flip put to be honest
I hope not!
hey let s redo blade and hire chris pratt to play blade
who played lara in the 2001 movies   I think she would be a better pick imo.
no disrespect to that person who lost their uncle but did they mean  scirrocis  of the liver not sculiosous
I got the perfect person to play lara croft...brendan fraser. Imean why not he can get to 600 pounds like what he did in the whale so he can get there again  melonie.
10 55 the least evil vegan
it would change so much about lara and her back story by doing that. I found her voice sometimes annoying in batwoman.dont get me started on the uncharted movie lol
they blocked az for pointing out their problem so this shouldn t surprise you
they dont count the rest of the world unfortunately    if its a flop in the us and a hit everywhere else its still a flop according to americans.
@thy mo  many tears. I like the other films better  but when I saw how hard this gal worked to shred like young jason statham  I had to applaud her efforts.
Im glad.. I left the twitter lol ..its seems on
womb raider to tomb raider.
great video
while the movies with angelina jolie weren t the greatest movies  debatable depending on which one of them you talk about   at least angelina could and very well did pass  as close as humanly possible  as lara croft. why not try and replicate that again.
black lara hard pass. hard. pass.
let s get ryan gosling to play black panther  because black panther isn t real guys!
tbh I dont really care about the live action movies no more. same happened with wesker and now with lara. as long as they dont touch the games Im fine with all the inclusion and sh!tthey already did with her body.
crystal dynamiiiiiics.
Im a vegan and I dont hate you. the youtubers are just putting on a show for clicks. normal people dont behave like that.
queen
just walk away walk away and close the door.
only if its as good as batwoman
batwhaman
she as lost it  big time
tom cruz as 6 foot 6 inch tall jack reacher.........
what      is this real
so  she sunk an already terrible show  and now she wants to sink another ip the narcissism in hollywood  is beyond real.
remember when marky mark played max payne  lol
lol no way. dont they want to make money
for real  imagine creating a breakout character so popular it gets added to the games and accepted by fans  nah lets just change the character!I think she is an attractive woman but its just tiring them changing the characters time and time again.
boom!!!
sadly I think should look great as a cosplay of her but she isn t the character though of course
she ballsed up batwoman   now shes goiing to balls up lara sigh!!!!!
these people want to destroy our childhood memories
might as well create a new film character instead of calling her lara croft. seeing as though it wouldn t be accurate to the lore thats already established in the video games. lol
everyone can dream about playing a certain character. doesnt mean they will be getting said role. even if she does this film would be a huge flop seeing as though thats not who lara croft is. lol
they really dont care about the fans. every time I hear   its fiction  its not real   rubbish! not only they re hypocrites  but they re also making fun of us. Imean  if we say black panther is not real  they will go ballistic and call us every name of the sun. besides  if they dont care  why the hell should I   whatever!
practice your british accent. I say melanie mac for lara croft.
I guess debate me is the internet equivalent to come at me bro.
sad part is she probably will be so they dont offend the whiners that are never happy. and just like batwoman it will flop and they will blame the actual fans of the franchise.
javicia leslie dont know a damn thing about tomb raider
they better not. how about creating a brand new character instead of changing up the already existing well established characters. but I guess that would take too much work  why try creating something original when you can rip of something that is already popular after all  right  thats what these people think
anyone could play the lara better than alicia vikander but if batwoman end up being the new lara Im really done she just dont look like her at all . lara reboot goes from bad to worse why they just cant give us what we really want and we just want the lara we all love and thats classic lara and attitude and appearance   dual pistols and shorts....
straight hair        curly hair.just saying...
o wow didn t know this  she s a great actress. would be interesting to see if she can pull it off.
this isn t just a race switch  she s going to be championing for the story to become one big sjw flop  which is the real problem.
sjw its a fictional characterblack panther race swapedsjw reeeeee
anya taylor joy from northman
that person would not fit as lara croft but at the same time I didnt really like alicia vikander either
to any trying to claim a character for their own nolan north didn t get to play lara croft.but he did get to be nathan drake.make your own stuff.
lol no  it wouldn t.
@john blaze  yes  it would.
@bruhman fromthefifthfloor  well Im sure you and the other 5 people interested will get a chance to see yet another franchise go broke. I ll get a good laugh out of it either way.
@john blaze  well  I said it would be interesting to see if she can pull it off.  good laugh   looks like we ll both be in high spirits  win win. good talk. God bless.
well then.
lol  she s kinda cute  but the role is just not meant for her. Im imagining myself posing as a chinese character and laughing at myself while trying to make myself legit. I would laugh harder if people actually believed my performance.no. there are other things out there that might fit her talents and predisposition better.
didn t they just remake tomb raider not too long ago  why would they want to try another remake so soon.
sorry  I think peter dinklage put in a claim on the role as well...decisions...decisions.
she is really pretty  she proved even pretty people can look ridiculous in horribly designed roles... and no.  just no.  stop it... get some help...
is this the scooby doo lara croft show  cuz if so then yes she s not whiteish but also Im not ever  ever  ever  ever  ever watching it
they should have made a lara croft movie with camilla luddington instead of just wasting her as just the mo-cap model.
commenting to feed the algorithm
blade and black panther should be cast as white. its only fair.
ugh. why bother
she will fail upwards until the entertainment industry runs out of money.
who wants to see the white martin luther king jr movie I do
some heros you just dont race swap  superman the flash lara croft black panther the list goes on  they just need to stop
Ive decided I too would like to play the new tomb raider. any objections   bigot
if I remember rightly  lara croft was based on the english model  nell mcandrew  who was also an athlete.
they have done it with the new res evil on netflix albert wesker is now a black guy with how things are now with movies and tv shows the people that make dont care about the fans.
I dont think batwoman is a great job resume. haha
oh God no!!!!
I want to see peoples faces when a white guy wants to audition for the role of cyborg.
grain brain lol
ugh. that remake was horrible.
omg no nope nope no thank you lol
that might end the world as we know it.
its not racist
nell mcandrew was a model for lara croft but lara s design was not based on her. nell wasn t even on board until tomb raider 3
@melonie mac go boom  - so sorry about that  mel. I wasn t quite sure - love your channel
asian batman anyone
haw haw haw
facepalm   manifesting your role    lol ok sure
no she fkn isn t. they better leave lara croft alone  I want to see her how I remember her playing the games  in fact its better they didn t make anything tomb raider  movies or tv  let it be. keep up the good work melonie.
so I was shit as batwoman   az and others have screamed and laughed about that disaster!   so I need a job  let s fxck up another classic and call the fans racist because Im shxt!... stay strong true fan s... cheer s
please. no more ..

so she wants to ruin another ip  she has one under here belt. shes  declaring  it now.   sure. she does not have acting talent to play the part either. her acting is on the same level as the plank larson and amber turd. no... just no. melanie  the hair style looks good.
eva mendes   angelina jolie for the 2001 movie. she had the kickass demeanor. jolie had too much of a round babyface.
Ive never heard of this actress before  but she doesnt look anything like lara  so... hard pass. enough with the retcons of an established character already. I didn t even watch the latest tomb raider movie because alicia vikander doesnt have the right body type to play lara.  nothing against vikander I like her in other roles.
I wanna see a black transwoman lara croft  formerly larry croft !
no no no no no no no no nono chance in hell
explain to me how race is integral to the character of lara croft lolalso  you talk about angelina jolie being able to play lara croft while she doesnt look like her either... its almost like the skin complexion is the problem here
javicia....stop appropriating my culture!
no she cant be  and there s no reason as to why she could be.
getting beyond a joke now all this race swapping  doesnt matter if it a flop just need get them woke points in . same as the new dr who
what was wrong with the last actress  she didn t even get more than one movie.. why recast  and why recast to someone that helped kill the show she ended up leading  thats just signing yourself up for failure...
reboot fans sound like snydercut fans.as an aside  everything best in moderation.
oh fucking no! say it ain t so
brie is ghostly
and it will be another fail project!
javicia leslie is delusional
my initial thought was thatshe wasn t even a good batwoman. why would you put her as a lead in a major franchise
so javicia leslie cant really act. her batwoman acting was not believable. even after 2 seasons her acting did not improve.
lara croft is not supposed to be a sobbing mess every time something bad happens  which she also makes everything about her in the reboot series. classic narcissistic behavior and its un-necessary. the left needs to stop trying. period.
I think u could play her character but not bat woman can u help the fans out and get the part please dont let bat woman get it u could make the character good not her
she s a fake fan   a fake gamer. duh!!!!!!!
if they want to keep race swapping white characters then they cant cry at all when a black characters gets race swapped to a white characters ether all race swapping is ok or none of it is
ad hominem and strawman are the top fallacies used by people who have no real ability to debate their point.
lara is white.
oooo here we go again no please God no I send what ever claim she has back to sender. as a black guy Im putting my foot down we dont want this race swapping just give us a accurate representation and a good story
I dont care for batwoman  I do care about laura.....can we please not turn her into a dumpster fire
can you call the girl a star if the show sucked that bad  I dunno
hmmm are you ok
so  after trying to make lara croft a lesbian tease now they want her to go woke  I dont care about race here  but lara croft is not james bond. she is a person with an unique style  personality  attitude and of course  a certain look. she is beautiful  she would be a beautiful laura cruz  but not lara croft. I hope she flops on her desire because if this really happens  Im done with the series.
yea they re called hispanic women
I want brad pitt to come out and say he is gonna be the new lara croft but have a sex change in the opening scene and change his name to larry croft. if any one says he cant do that then they are antI lgbt homophobic racist misogynists
I am just gonna say it  I dont want anymore tomb raider movies  ever.   they will never do it correctly.
if so then lets make a white martin luther king jr movie yall want to change or characters we can do the same lets go white martin luther king jr
I was vegan for 7 years and I lost 2 stone in weight  collapsed at work and was signed off by my doctor for 2 months. Im now post-vegan  the most hated kind of vegan. so here s a tip. point out that abortion is not vegan and watch the cognitive dissonance unfold.
but  but  weez wuz tombraiderz n sheeit. sorry dude. I couldn t resist.
@mr. joe dirt   I dont get it but Im with you
@hezekiah thomas  we wuz kangz n sheeit  is a silly quote poking fun at men of color that claim they are descended from egyptian pharaohs. they always say   we were kings.  I like to cut up alot. sometimes I can get a little politically incorrect. I have a childish south park sense of humor. no offense meant.
@mr. joe dirt   no problem I get it trust I hate having to presence my race online but its become second nature because whenever I say something its always   you can say that your not black
in the words of the joker   its not about money.. its about sending a message.
hmmm no
Im gonna portray mlk. if you dont think that I fit the role. its because youre racist. not because Im a blue eyed white boy.
I thought black elves was dumb. but lara croft  I couldn t care less what she looks like. if she doesnt look like the lara croft that you are used to  if the movie is good  you will forget about it about two minutes into the movie.  claiming  the role is arrogant and annoying though.
to be honest  her role as batwoman was bad mostly because of the showrunners was cringe af  maybe she is a good actress  just suffering from bad writting.
what we are seeing here is a whole group of faux nerds who hate nerd culture. and they are the showrunners.
sure whatever.just butcher lara croft like hollywood butchers everything else we love. why should we expect anything different at this point lets have a black robocop  a black xena  a black austin powers and a black tom   jerry.
no
what if they say lara just got really really tan
ofc she will.....oh well  another flop  but who needs to make money as long as social justice is represented
at the end of the day  if they want a strong black female character create one. same goes for any race gender sexuality swap. if nothing else its just fucking lazy.
you get so many black upper class women here in the uk not. lara is white and if you want to keep sales high keep it that way.
star of batwoman  more like complete and utter failure
I know let s race swap. its unoriginal and clich  now
just no
nope. and nope. lara is white and english. thats not racism  thats the f  king character. oh  wait  this is a joke. right
and it will be a flop just like batwoman but hey  if they still haven t learned let them get another lesson for the books.
I bet he wouldn t bring up religion if a muslim had offended his grass eating
weez wuz tombzraiderz n sheeit
I have no problem with a black woman being laura croft  just not this one. her  acting  is horrible. everyone complained about domino in dead pool 2  but that actress killed it.
they ll never do a black austin powers.he s too sexist for the current era.aka the era of crybabies.
I want to see a white undercover brother.
melonie  a white person can no longer voice act a poc
not gonna happen
young halle berry as lara croft.
please dont give hollyweird ideas.
let s make blade white. if you can make an iconic character like ariel or whisker from resident evil black what s the problem. seems like one sides being racist
after seeing her  act  in batwoman I wouldnt cast this lady in anything  let alone cast her in tomb raider as lara freakin croft. she s a pretty face but she aint fit to even be cast as iconic black characters lmao. the delusions of this lady!
well  looks like Im 1st. so its my turn to say something for once   post some comments
u have to be white because that is how the character is made do u want a white martin luther king jr if not then u should understand
the early 2000s was just a different time a simple time wish I can go back people are just insane now and cant appreciate what lara croft and alot of other fictional stories characters  escapeism no longer exists cuz caultural appropriation and people trying to change characters originality no Im not of european angalo decent so if anyone trow the racist propoganda at me your a special breed of stupid  she s 100  right  people need to slow down and chill damn
javicia leslie is not anywhere near lara croft!! hayley atwell is perfect for the role.....perfect!! if they race swap lara croft  then the next shaft movie better be white or hispanic. Im just saying.
Im sorry but no  I want lara to be lara. she isn t lara and yeah Im sorry lara croft is a white upper class british woman. thats that.
lara croft is white and english Im so sick of this shit doing it for no reason at all this is what pisses people off imagine if we change and black character white just because of reason they would be ww3.
just get to the damn point already!!!!!!!
call be a bigot but isn t lara white
I want the part  if I dont get it your a racist  Im white but would think it would be stupid if a white guy was playing kunta kinte  mandela or the black panther  yet you get black actresses playing anne boleyn and snow white  ok with that  but lets rename them coal black and white panther  even made up characters was written for a certain culture  oliver twist   lara croft   james bond.
so now she wants to ruin tomb raider the way she ruined  batwoman
I am just saying u cant take a white character and make them black and u cant take a black character and make them white thats dumb
nope.  she s not manifesting  she s threatening the makers of tomb raider via virtue signaling and racism.  which would have worked...in 2018.  but  its 2022 and elon musk is a thing.  so  this attempt will fall flat.  its sad thatshe actually believes that this will work  so pretty  but so out of touch with reality.
good  javice...keep telling black ppl can not have their own icons  nah just steal the other s stuff.pathetic...racism its not the one what puts their pathetic behaviur  its common sense.
honestly  I didn t care for alicia vanderkar as lara croft.
I wouldn t buy the game if they race swap laura. laura croft is a caucasian englishman.
imagine how dumb black panther would have been with white actors. or if miles morales  spiderman  was turned white. there are some things that dont matter imo like james bond. as long as he is british.
michelle rodriguez could do it as an example of a non white person who could
racist people or trying to take or characters
look  Im all for a black lara  under 1 condition...she has to be british...lara is and always will be british...javicia is neither  and only wants to be a diversity hire.
black panther isn t real  either.
batwoman show was God awful none of the cast was any good at acting apart from rachel skarsten who played the villain and carried the show for 3 seasons. javica leslie is a wokie trying to score points on twitter.
of corse they gonna bring are Christianity into it for no reason how sad  they rebelling against you and God sadly
lara croft is white. just as black panther is black. thatsimple.
first
honestly...why not  jolie and vikander had their time. if new girl does it justice  then so what
it is racist. all race swapping is racist. and I would happily call it out when an established black character is swapped out for a white one... but of course  I will not have to worry about that day happening.Imean  it would be less obvious what they were doing if it wasn t always white character replaced by black. do these people realise that black and white aren t the only two  not even going into how it only ever goes one way.
sure  why not ! samuel l jackson played a nazI in the spirit. that movie flopped but dont let thatstop you. if you dont think a white  british  billionaire  can be played by black americanthen I dont know what to tell you. lol. but seriously...dont  just dont.
its racist to race swap lara croft.   its racist to race swap characters  no matter what direction you swap.  its also sexist to gender swap characters.stick to the lore  or boycotts.want diversity   add characters  but stick to the lore when you do it.  in other words  dont add a black woman to lara croft  who ends up being the real hero of the show.really sick of what hollywood churns out.  other hobbies are looking really enjoyable at this point  like hiking  camping  cycling  etc...
in terms of black women playing lara  I think halle berry could work.
first off  yes  this is badbut also  colorism is a thing.... she s black  so she can never be tomb raider
there s nothing wrong with her saying she wants to be lara croft this is not  news  or even discussion worthy   its pretty offensive to imply she would be a worse version of the character because she s a person of color or because briI is too light  thats just like telling someone on halloween their costume is bad because they re male    female or the color of their skin thats just plain wrong and honestly disgusting behavior say what you will about welcome to raccoon city but the movie wasn t better or worse because they let humans with a little extra melanin play characters like jill valentine   leon kennedy  they grew up with   dreamed of being theses characters too you know   they dont exist just for you or anyone of us !!
same. I d be done.
hooray!!!
