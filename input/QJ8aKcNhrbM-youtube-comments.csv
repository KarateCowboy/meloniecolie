hey mel  just wanted to say these videos have really gotten me thru some tough times lately  mom is in the hospital  had to take off work without pay and your infectious and bubbly personality put a smile on me in tough times. thanks so much  keep up the good fight
Im really proud that normal common sense women are speaking out against the social justice warriors it brights my soul up every day thanks for making these videos !
when Imeet someone for the first time  I like to make a joke that is wildly offensive. itsets the tone for what they re in for if they stick with me. lol
the wokies gonna woke  while we re over here drinking vodka and sprite. congrats on 20k subscribers and hope your aunt is doing great.
...and predators  Imean   male feminists   - you frikkin nailed it.
there came a point in my life where I realized almost everyone Imet with one of those religious  coexist  bumper stickers were always the most bigoted  intolerant jerks and Im finding it to also apply for those with  mental health advocates  in their bio along with other red flags.
omg Im so almost teared up someone so pretty like you  defending lgbt  you dont have to but it takes so much courage. I really appreciate the video. living in really hard times as lgbt  I feel like things go way backwards  I felt more free before. I feel like people are gonna kill me if I act a bit feminine including the gays
the wokies gonna woke  while we re over here drinking vodka and sprite.   immediately grabs a vodka mudshake chocolate
lol your a breath of fresh air kid    I just  subbed   the only time I was discriminated against in my life was when all the leaders at my work thought I was white   Imade the highest score on the advancement test but hr called me to the office and said sorry but we already have to many white people in that position   ps Im from arkansas too   praying for aunt
it is a fan s right to have whatever opinion they want to have.  and people are going to be upset  because especially when youre talking about books or games  because youre never going to be the exact person who they had in their head  or who they played  henry cavillso fuck this hating mob!
yes!!! you did go boom melonie mac. congratulations on 20k!! I hope your aunt is okay too. prays to her. no rest for a warrior like you
happy to see your channel booming  ive been here since youre second vid! love your work and keep it up.
that cat is adorable. these wokes will never understand that cat people can do no wrong.
politically incorrect  but literally erect  is the story of my life
we will wage war against the woke soydiers with memes.
back during her  leave britney spears  days  she knows what its like to be cancelled for expressing herself. so this does not surprise me thatshe s against cancel culture.
hImelonie thank you so much for another incredible fun entertaining episode.I totally agree with you with everything you have been saying sinceyou put this chanel into existence.I was wondering whats the name of the groupthatsigns while you are closing out your episodes  keep doing your thing melonie your awesome takecare melonie
the funniest family fight Ive ever witnessed was an indian family. my buddy said he had the best hair. all hell broke loose  hope you aunt beats the cancer  sending my prayers and love.
100  about the heritage stuff. I have never had to discuss race and other things until recent years. makes me miss texas. I regret leaving the state and going to work up north. one of my employers made comments about what I selected on the race ethnicity section. this was after my 3rd year of employment. now one of the things is I never filled out an application I had sent in a resume. I had been asked what I was and a few other things when the interview concluded and I got the job but never thought anything of it. but I uprooted my life for the job. so when they asked if I was mislabeling myself I was baffled. I got a lecture on how my skin is too pale and I dont look like the rest of my kind. I didn t get fired but work got really hard. but great thing when I left several people went with me. when I left I had a dna test done to see what I actually was. I shared that with hr on the way out the door. I was more of a minority than I thought I was. lmfao I should have gotten a promotion by their logic. also  what s more  I did look just like the coweta creek tribe. I looked more like them than I ever looked jewish. but what surprised me after this journey is that I learned that native american people have more neandertal dna than europeans among other things. but this woke nonsense gets on my nerves so much. I just want to live free and peacefully.
you obviously aren t native american. you look nothing like elizabeth warren.   seriously though  congratulations on the 20k  and keep up the good work.
hope y all are okay!!
thats a man  baby.
I wouldn t call cara cunningham a normal common sense woman  but im happy for everyone who speaks against these kinds of people.
hahaha yesss! and thank you!
isn t cara a transwoman  lmao. why do you people pick and chose what type of  woke  you ll accept or not accept
@satan  perhaps its because we re not defining people s entire outlook or lives due to their identities... maybe take some time to think that over. the pushback is about bad ideas not whether somebody is trans or not. also  you people  - reductive  much  I see captain  generalisation  is in the house.
they always seem to have the nastiest comments dont they
I am religious and refuse to coexist. proudly bigoted. put that on my bumper.
I dont have a mini-fridge full of multiple vodka mudshake flavors  I swear! I like to make adult milkshakes using vodka mudshakes  vanilla ice cream and syrup  depending on the mudshake I will use chocolate or caramel .
woke   broke
literally a mood
the more upset they get  the more the memes will flow.
hahahaha!
thanks for doing what you do! I came over from thequartering  and you get a daily listen from me at work. ps  any chance we can get a quick tour of your tomb raider collection  figures  statue  and stuff  take care and keep it up!
just discovered your channel. boom! new subscriber here. love what you cover. and og lara fan here so preach girl!! keep rocking on. love your end video thoughts of the day.
thank you for your channel youremind me every day to be resoulte in what I believe and what I want my family to believe.
the based queen. we love to see it. keep fighting back.
thank you for providing the best content ever melonie
Im glad I gave this channel a try. you are doing good work here  very positive.  keep it up
I have done two episodes dedicated to mental health awareness. I have seen how brutally some people suffer with disorders like bulimia  bipolar  and ptsd. it truly is awful and we often feel so helpless. cancelling someone for some dumb reason does nothing to better that person in any way. its just bullying. when we see a 12 year old take their life as a result of bullying  why would we think its ok to bully someone for having a certain political ideology or belief system
Ive always loved her too  her comedy is so on point!!
cara spilled tea! and it was boiling hot!   loved the video!
youread my comment to everybody!  this has made my day  and Im still smiling about it!  thank you!
ive been following cara for years and years   I had to delete my instagram and Imiss her the most!
Ive seen other people suggest it to nick rekieta that he should have you on one of his shows  he does law stuff during the day and laughing at dummies at night  if he reaches out to you  you should go on one of his shows think it d be a blast
every so often someone comes along and just asks the perfect question  if anyone can be lara croft then what s the point of being lara croft  ask a woke troll and their brains will shut down for a month.
congrats on 20k  the kitty did steal the show  especially when itstarts watching the door  and then goes off-screen.
politically incorrect  but literally erect  that is gold.
good quote of the day.  I ll try not to freak out on some people.
honestly  because of you Im looking into the carnivore diet. I need to make changes in my life and maybe starting with what I eat is a start.
thats the leave britney alone person ! love it holy shit lmao I wanna hang out with her
props to cara
wow I forgot the  leave britney alone  person. I thought it was a girl even at the time. lolbut happy to see shes based now.
oh sweet! you got this! dr ken berry on youtube is am amazing resource
@melonie mac go boom  thank you. truly.
you went to see your family.  I wish I was a fly on the wall when you got to tell them that you didn t take a knee to the pharisees  and in so doing discovered the multitudes who love you for who you are.  I imagine they couldn t be happier.
bruh  cara leveled the f up! xdwhat a queen.
congrats on hitting 20k subs on this channel!
omg this is so good!! Im dying
I didn t know you before the jeremy shoutout and I find your energy  and takes  very refreshing.
really glad your channel is still takin off. keep er up  lady bomber  and go boom!!!
you cantalk about whatever you like.  spitting the truth applies to a vast array of topics  including race heritage.  your opinions come as well put together arguments.  keep it up!
I love cara!!
peace be still. and know that I am the Lord.
I d drink with that lady lol. I know what you mean about being native. Im around 40  cherokee but Im super white cause irish. stay in your lane nerds lol
I honestly think you should name your fans as  boomers ... would be a sweet inside joke  -
its not just about skin color  even if youre white with a mix it then goes to language  I have a german father and a white south african mother also with german in the family  when I tell people Im half german the first thing people ask is if I can speak german as if thatsomehow makes me german
haha she s so right and funny...lol
I like seeing people with common sense.
glad u and aunt may r doing well  go boom!
thats the same person  was it chris crocker before  I forget but thats awesome! Im happy to hear there are more sane people out there who are influencers who are against censorship.
God bless texas  thanks for the video!
funny as hell !
subscribed! thanks for resisting the lefty  wokies. suggest getting on alt tech like rumble etc. cant trust big tech
thank you for shouting me out!
yes  thats the former chris crocker.
@jean gentry  nice  I always wondered where chris went but now I know. my ex followed them but now Im gonna since I know now.
@the bearding way  what are you serious thats actually chris crocker no no I was  kind of a fan of him first of his year with the britney video and then I forgot all about him. no I cant believe he did that I cant believe he s a female I cant believe he transitioned. I had a gay crush on chris crocker yes Im willing to admit that. but Im not gay. I just had a small crush on him but I cant believe he did this wow
she is but the channel will not come up in a search and she has no link
@dean firnatine  rumble still working on this glitches I believe
I grew up with my grandparents telling us we are part native american.
yay  macdrop... currently enjoying my carnivore crisps and a g-fuel lol.
ain t no rest for the wicked  money dont grow on trees...
nice timing just finished my work out lol.
good job youre awake  not  woke
move along  wokies  melonie has the high ground.
I am elated to find out that go boom is a texan product.
when they perfect human cloning  they need to make like a million melonie macs.
is brittany ok though  the disney kids seem to have a lot of probs. I wish her the best and hope Im wrong and isn t damaged from her upbringing. I cant even imagine trying to have a grip on reality with her past.
they did my childhood movie justice with this continiuation on netflix holy shit n youtube is erasing sub  melonie u had 20.7 now its at 20.6
well that was educational
I get what you mean about leftist saying  youre not x  - I constantly get told I am committing cultural appropriation against  latino culture  even though spanish was my first language  and my father was a cuban refugee because I look white af. its like  what  I cant enjoy latin music  or food  because Im not brown enough or I am too white to fit your stereotype
went to see jordan peterson tonight  you woulda loved it!
we dont have a lot of money so we have been stockpiling meat because its rapidly becoming unaffordable.  we buy fresh for the freezer   buy canned meat and learned how to can specifically to put it on the shelf.  we have really liked the home canned because it makes the meat very tender.  its fully cooked so it makes meal prep easy when we dont have time.  we rotated meat from our freezers for canning.  we aren t strict keto but the majority is keto based
I was sent by the quartering. he made a good suggestion. I wish you luck on this youtube stuff
the sad thing is we also believe in this thing called forgiveness.  wokies dont understand that concept.  and the inclusion of a few comments in each video is so dare I say inclusive.  thats the kind of inclusion that I love.
a power fantasy is something to strive towards  am I ever going to be ripped like gutz or have an automail leg like edward elric  no. but I cantry for it  work out with weights and save for a cosmetic prosthesis that is made  of lightweight metal.might never happen but  I canat least try for it  thats what a power fantasy is meant to do inspire you!
day 11 of me commenting on your videos until g-fuel sponsors me lmfao.  we re straight vodka and sprite  had me dying
generally speaking  you only have to worry about demonetization if its within the first 90 seconds I believe  otherwise swearing is fair game.
I still get a kick outta your thumbnail with the jay jay the jet plane photoshop. lol
hello haha  great comment there on the lara craft situation.
@andrew keen  thanks!
good to know!
@melonie mac go boom  definitely do your own research into it  but based on the big yt creators I follow regularly thats what they ve said. I also suspect there s other elements at play with certain channels like the quartering for example  who has to self censor a ton.
wait   leave brittany alone  is a woman  I have  since I first saw that  always assumed it was a guy and never had any reason to think otherwise.
I cant call him a her... I just cant. it is what it is but if thats you  then you do you. great video either way.
keep up the good content...................
congratulations!!! 20k!!!
honestly  if most of these people actually met a full native  they d probably mistake them for mexican  just because their visual stereotypes are so twisted and bastardized
congrats for 20k
this is a little off topic but could you tell us the meaning of your tattoos  they may be self explanatory but its hard to see them in the vids.
melonie has to drive around the country because if she got on a plane  she d destroy the left wing.
that was funny.
really dig the outro song. any chance of a source
awesome.... congrats ok 20k subs!!!
cara is pretty based actually...
we all would be a whole lot better off if most people just minded their own business  put their own house in order before the start giving everyone else advice. when they dont know come here from siccum.
hello fellow  texan love  your channel
the saddest part about this chanel  is that I dont have time to watch it... jeremy videos I just let play on the banckgorund and I listen to them while Im doijng other stuff  bu with you  I acctuly want to watch you  but I dont have that time rn  -
fellow arkansasonian   south loves you
so are you still gonna upload on your main channel or are you just upload on this one
chris crocker is based as fuck  always has been.
08 17 lmfao!
the boom squad!
@crazy harry  what about blaire white
@crazy harry  Im extremely anti-leftist and anti-woke and always have been. I hate the woke lgbtq trans hysteria since itstarted. that being said I am a classical liberal and am very happy to just live and let live and respect how other people want to live  so long as it doesnt harm anybody else. I dont live in the western world so have never had to deal with this pronoun shit or even think about it in thatsense  but I naturally just call transvestites by their  new  pronouns most of the time. its not even on purpose lol  doesnt bother me though so hey.
putting political  muh pronouns  cark over your lying eyes  huh  okay wokie.
exactly
what did you think of lara croft and the temple of osiris  and lara croft and the guardian of light
booom baby!!!

cara  leave melonie alone .... pleaaseee!!if she wants to believe she s native american  she has every right to do so. pleaaseee!!!
predictor she says.............. Im amused
how do you stay committed to your diet  Im very  lazy  in my personal life of taking care of myself  I do lean towards a high meat diet for what I should consume but Im not very good to committing to the same shit
show some love to your cat for me! my cat died three weeks ago. she was 21 years old. enjoy them while they re around! Im not trying to bum you out though! sorry!
they were ok. gol was some good fun  too not nearly as good
@melonie mac go boom  I liked them they respected itsomewhat and I liked that it felt like they didn t take it thatseriously like  okay ppl its a tomb raider game but dont go crazy. I also liked tomb raider relic run
you mean chris crocker.
the stupid just wokes said similar things about my cousin when he was on big brother canada just because he has white skin.

let me know when they start handing out that  privilege  they keep talking about... meanwhile  my industry is dying for help! if 100 people of every minority status could start tomorrow  that would be fantastic. I ll be right there rolling out the red carpet! as we do check our politics at the door   woke  people need not apply...
shoutout ms.
show the cat!!!!
based leave britney alone
she
miss what hippie   grateful your aunt will recover soon.  remember just  vodka and sprite . nom on the taco.  it really is ass backwards.  hasn t it always been about that  controlled chaos  divide us because they know it is an easier pill to swallow instead of all of us coming together organically to go up against what we are tired of.
welcome to texas. Im new here to.
its a he not she
is that cole train
I hate these new clothing trends even depop I hate that add soooo much . my trend is the 1920s let s all go back to the old school days . men were men women were women let s go to that era ! by the order of the peaky blinders .
was on instagram  but looks like she took it down
@melonie mac go boom  damn  I wanted to share that one. I was laughing a little too hard at that
ah there he is! gif name.
20k
greetings from the other t state and that is my state the great state of tennessee
all he does is eat gross on facebook   saying how pretty he is
caaaaaaaaaaaat
large portions of native americans are in the south  the southwest  and the west. I haven t heard of massachusetts offering up land for tribes  or staten island. have you
boom 20k
chris is back into being trans. I thought they were into being a guy. I still remember when the chris crocker channel was shut down . I guess Im out of the loop.
video @ 2 30
anyone wanna take bets on how long it ll take us to get a   white men are great  out of context clip
hey quit telling me how great I am or my wife is gonna get jealous
war against the white man  kek! have we ever lost one  good stuff macmommy.
please forgive me  but is cara female
I almost didn t click on this video because of the ugly thumbnail.
its still inherently woke to refer to cara as a  she . mixed messages here. fight wokeness but embrace other parts  sure we can agree with some things said by cara  but youre already being politically correct by using his preferred pronouns.
chris crocker is cringe though
whitemen are great  why thank you
thats a man...
