why cant we just have a badass  feminine  adventurous lara  its incrediblly simple yet they keep butchering it!
I love the reboots but this is on a whole other level  dear God please dont let them create this. glad the community is standing against this.
lara croft  loneliness ! lol. lara never gaf about companionship. she literally lived in a mansion with a single butler. she explored caves alone and kicked ass. this crap is downright rediculous. scissor me timbers.
just like with he-man  master chief  luke skywalker etc. why cant they just let our characters be strong and heroic  or in lara s case being an anti-hero
the worst part to me is the  lonely and needs a team for support  part. ugh. such a shame everything has to be this way now. Imiss protagonists that are just lone wolf badasses!
I just want lara to have fun again and go on independent adventures. in the reboots she goes on adventures to save the world or save someone else.. not because she enjoys it. they literally took away everything that made her lara and her entire iconic persona. Im so tired  I just want her to be lara again.
melonie  you keep being real. who wants to be part of a community that allows this type of bs to continue. I ll continue to support you 100 . let s take control of tomb raider  buy the license rights  whatever we have to do to get the games we actually want made. every popular game out there is someone s favorite  let s make good games for all of them.
we already know that og lara isn t coming back any time soon... this makes me feel dead inside that they actually destroyed tomb raider...
when I see a person with a platform like yours speaking the truth that its kinda hard to find nowadays its bring me joy. thank you. you took the words out of my mouth
this  sounds  awful  thank you for reporting these leaks
gaming companies are just afraid of twitter and being  canceled . the world we live in has become so soft its disgusting.
them taking all the info down seems to suggest these leaks are real  sadly.I had a good laugh at the idea of lara as a narcissistic psychopath  actually. that would have made her so much more relatable to the  I want to see myself in the characters  crowd.I actually already emailed embracer to bring these leaks and negative reaction harm it will cause their investment. they might be able to get this project shelved until they cantake over and do things right.I know you get a lot of flak for speaking your mind. I have a lot of respect for you doing that. keep it up  and know I ll keep praying for you to have the strength to deal with the hate.
lara having a romantic relationship of any kind feels wrong.  if anything  I d picture her as being into hookup culture.  find a random dude  spend the night  leave before he wakes up and never talk to him again.  a girl has needs  after all.  she s never been the type to let someone catch feelings  let alone catch them herself.
I just really love the idea of lara being asexual. a power-fantasy woman who is  like you said  married to her work. she s built like a Goddess and definitely has been sexualized. I like the juxtaposition. imo it would be best if her sexuality doesnt come into play at all.
iam gay myself  but I always imagined lara as asexual aromantic. she is in love with adventure  history  shiny artifacts   fast wheels !
making lara a lesbian is a really bad idea that is not who she is . she is a loner . she leaves people for dead and the dust great video melonie when she is working someone she is forced to like the witchblade and tombraider comic crossover
I am so glad I found you again. I watched you when I was a young girl and I was amazed that another girl loved lara and tomb raider so much like I do. I have been watching all your lara vids on this channel and from what we are hearing  I am so  so sad that they have done this to  our fave character. I absolutely love your commentary on this  subbed so I dont forget you again!
first tomb raider inspired nd to make their uncharted game  and now  nd inspires cd to make laura croft.
I loved the origin story reboot and stuff   but all I wanted in the end was to see lara to finally become the badass she was meant to be. I thought that was the whole point  like after all her experiences and where she came from  what an amazing satisfying feeling it would be to finally see lara as the tomb raider she was meant to be...
you do you melonie  keep speaking your truth opinions. if your friends fan base wants to leave because they have different opinions then let them go  never trade quality for quantity. its times like these you find out who s got your back even if they believe differently. love ya mel  alwaysbeauthentic
because  the message . everyone has to be gay  black or trans now. or changed to a woman if its a man. since lara is already female  they took the next illogical step
@firefly  oh poor you  keep crying please!
@kelly paie  did a trans gay just get offended.cry a river
@holy 97  no im not your dad
@kelly paie  where is your father
because crystal dynamics
@boycott  cant have male friends
@kelly paie  nah you a mother
people that complain alot about the reboots dont realise it can and most likely will get incredibly worse.
seems to me like they are going to try making this multiplayer somehow so they can charge for garbage online.  no need for a team of tomb raiders
well a multiplayer wouldn t be bad but I want a solid 20  hour solo campaign made from the early tr developers. if they were to make a multiplayer it better not include any of the main characters  and should honestly be distinct from the game. but its hard to make money off single player games when you blow 100 million on it
this is not a good look for character. these movies need dynamic  intriguing stories. maybe she could flirt with a cute hetero couple.
@1chasg  something always can be worse  even if this new reboot turns out to be worse. itstill doent change the fact for me that the third wave motivated reboot  will remain to be an abomination of the highest order. nor do I want a zillion lara s like how the dc marvel are ruining their characters with all these dumb multiverse versions.
@afca nsf   marvel s  what if.....the writers were good
was fine with tombraider1  then rise didn t even connect to the first in the slightest aside from some throwaway text log  so rise felt like the real  beginning of a new trilogy.  then shadow comes out  is the worst of the three  has to be a  finale  even though realistically its just the second in the new reboot and has the worst story to boot. series should have just been a 4 game series with how they failed to make the first relate to the others in the slightest.
the twitter community like this shitso much so yeah I think there s like 90  chance that they re going to absolutely do this
@chase crappel  wow I disagree.  I haven t finished shadow but it might be the best one of the new series to me  although I loved the first.  the 2nd I had to sort of force myself to finish.
@chase crappel  well tomb raider 2013 you were fine with. tomb raider 1 came out in 1996 lol
honestly just because she has a girlfriend doesnt mean anything. Imean they tease all the time bayonetta and jeanne have a thing for each other but it doesnt take away from bayo s character. if this is done right it could be miles better then anything from the survivor trilogy and finally be back to the bad ass lara we all know and love.
tbh first game in reboot trilogy was the best  also probably the best lara overall. Imean it would be better if she didn t turn into john rambo around the second encounter with enemies and start mass murder spree but everything else about it was so good and made sense.
@1chasg  2nd and 3rd game were weak as fuck but 1st one was surreal imho.
I didn t like the reboot
the reboots sucked  lara was a whiny annoying brat in them even in tr 4 she displayed maturity when she was young.
@1chasg  the thing about the reboot trilogy was that a lot of us didn t play the originals and never got to play uncharted because sony exclusive bullshit. so there was a huge void of players on xbox pc that didn t have any game like that to scratch that itch. so when tr2013 rolled around and was very technically adept at the time and shared a lot of concepts with uncharted  people liked it. we finally got a taste of that uncharted cake  but we didn t really realize  that it would end up contradicting the source material so heavily. after hearing some of melanie s points being a mega fan I cantotally see why she s not crazy about the newer games. in fact as a newer fan to the franchise myself  Ive come to agree with her on what the lara character should really be. fem fatal  confident  witty  unobtainable  married to her work  motivated by self gain etc. it just sounds way cooler of a character than mopey  crying  always needs help  lonely  survivor girl.
@goofball1 _  oh I totally agree. I would much rather see the badass  sarcastic and confident lara back  but I fear things will only get worse. fingers crossed tho.
romance or any sort of relationship drama or even shippings was never a thing in tomb raider and should never be. tr has always been about action  adventure and exploration. the fact they ve added such element starting with the reboot trilogy  and want to go even deeper with what the latest game might be shows they re aiming for different kind of audience  think last of us 2  and further drifting from fans of the older tr games.
scissor me timbers ....
right. these people obviously never heard of  empaths  or the lone wolf who thrives on self reliant individualism. everything has to fit into the accepted social framework of the current pc trend. its getting old  and downright pathetic.
they just ran out of ideas of what s the next tomb raider going to be. thats why they making things ridicilous and makes no sense. I definitely not gonna play the next tomb raider game if they really do it with those stupid script.
og lara still had a flirty and feisty spirit to her. like Im sure she s had a few lovers  romantic flings  and could realistically get any guy she wanted.
@mr. sinjin-smyth  remove all the relationship drama and crying from your average 2  hour actionflick today  and youre right back to the 1  hour average movie length of the past. the pandering to a female audience is everywhere now  and paid for by the male majority consumer group  because said group simply dont show up in sufficient numbers. they just complain about the lack of female oriented content.you only have two choices  either learn to live with the constant financial exploitation  and get a product partly irrelevant to you as a man  while they destroy your favourite franchises in return.-or stop buying these products  and stop being the financial back-up for their social engineering experiment  full stop.
tbh I never saw lara as being lonely. and even if she understandably were  she d at least fill that void with friends and co-workers. she s had so many caring friends  starting from tomb raider 4 and continuing into the 2013 reboot. and she never been heartless to them either. they dont need to add any romance. lara always came across to me as aro-ace  and in the movies  perhaps just aromantic. if they re trying to do some representation  they re not applying it correctly. as a gay male  lara wasn t relatable to me in that way but she was an iconic role model  and Im sure for other people her ability to live on her own happily  on good terms with friends from her past  was great representation.
that butler probably got some
@knox2don  not only this  but stay a victim! sometimes life is shit  but you deal with it! become better and stronger  dont stay there!
@g vnhtsm  more like always remain sad  apologetic  childish  bitter  resentful  regretful  etc.. rather than grow up and become a strong  honorable  cunning  responsible  unapologetic  etc... adult.
they dont like strong role models for some reason. such can either be a hero  anti-hero  or even a villain.
@mr. sinjin-smyth  strong role models inspire people to become strong themselves.  what  they  want is for most people to be weak  and without ambition.  this makes them easily controlled.
@interstellardave  strong role models dont compromise. they stick to their beliefs and ambition  and dont care what anyone thinks of them and just go about and lead by example.
because everyone these days needs to be relatable even those characters who were never created in that in mind in the first place. I hate thatstupid trend now and many more . some characters are created so that we can look up to them and try to be better ourself but no let s give loosers a looser so that those loosers can stay loosers and think thats great. unlike with classic lara that got many teenagers out of their misery and made them stronger and more confident. if you wanted to be like lara you had to make an effort. with new lara just start crying and youre a true lara croft. yay! well done in achieving nothing!
same formulaic shit.  deconstruction of a beloved character to push a younger more boring version. abandoned the already built in fanbase to get a non existing one.  bet Im right.
lara croft isn t a victim. she wasn t a victim in the survivor trilogy
when you mentioned master chief  are youreferring to his game version or the tv show version
as someone that has not played the original games  how is she an antI hero
because feminism and the message
yeah I want to look like the hulk I dont want professor hulk looking like me
crystal dynamics is extremely dumb. the secret to the game is in the name  tomb raider. not tomb raiders. not artifact hunters. not even lara s support group. one  singular tomb raider. all you need is tombs  artifacts and a singular thrill seeker.
a support team does make sense  but it doesnt have to be massive. it was mostly needed in survivor because it was a new starter story for her  growing from a somewhat sheltered girl into a strong warrior. she s become that now  the survivor lara is very close to the lara most know and love  so staying in the survivor timeline but making her increasingly badass and a powertrip with a much smaller support team behind her would be great. watch her grow even more  become fearless  tough and an anti-hero. humanize her  sure  but in a way that works for the character of lara. it must work properly. less drama  more power fantasy. elements of drama and such  but not overblowing it.but... yeah. I have less and less hope for all of entertainment in the world. everything sadly goes woke more and more.
Imuch prefer the original version of lara because she strong and tall and a adventurer thats in love with the getting to her destination and not giving a crap about the good or evil people
yes  im not big on tomb raider but we need to support the real tr to protect our culture.
I agree!! in a youtube where everyone seems to fake  I like her realism!!
Im with you too. Im tired of seeing fake fans being positive all the time and not letting integrity get in to bring more badness.
true. my first action game on pc was actually tomb raider. my dad got it for me.
tomb raider got owned by uncharted. how can a rip off of your franchise be better than the original  then the reboot tried to rip off the rip off and failed to even come close to its charm. tomb raider was dead long ago  going woke was just the final nail in the coffin.
I feel so sad too. they are ruining it. time to boycott them.
they had no intention of bringing the old lara back ...they already did that twice with anniversary and legend..
they can never truly destroy it as long as you keep it alive in your head and hearts. I feel the same about marvel and dc  and have stopped reading our spring anything from those companies... but I still have my old stuff  and they simply cant take that from me no matter how hard they try. nobody can dictate what you like and enjoy unless you let them. simply refuse... sooner or later  the money will talk and things will change.
@lincoln pascual  I hope what you say is true. what they do is cater to a new audience who have no idea f what is realy going on... and they sell the game that way. however  this time  you can make sure tr banned in all arab countries so that is one step ahead for their financial crisis t start. we eant the same in the rest  nkt bcz I a against honosexuality  not at all . but to be against the bs  the studio is putting into our beloved franchise and its character. netflix should cancel the animated series.
the last 3 games were absolutely fantastically great! I want much much more of that!
@google account  go plau uncharted and the last of us then. we want tr away from that boring formula.
@mohammad el hajjar    some of you   want
exactly friend  but some fan made game in tr2 remake did it better!
before the reboot tomb raider games were getting worse and worse  and selling less and less. even the solid remakes of the originals didn t sell very well.the series only started doing well again  both critically and financially  with the reboot.your  destroyed  vision of the tomb raider games  well  they started to either suck or were simply played out  and nobody wanted to buy them.
@jesse rogalski  no  that is not the case. they started selling less because yes for five years  tomb raider 5 plays exactly like tr1  no room for any development or extra creativity. the reboot is critically acclaimed for graphics  nothing related tp creating an icon the way the classic games did. tr s problems is that it is way too complicated to be in the hands of zero-inspired human beings who are so much into hollywod cliche.
@mohammad el hajjar  Imean  its exactly the case. you just said Im wrong  then repeated exactly what I said about tomb raider becoming less and less popular over time. they even did the cod thing and allowed multiple teams to work on the series to get different tones in the games  and neither new teams  not the original team  were making games thatsell. the series only started doing well again after the reboot  so it was obviously a good move for them.and I dont know why you have issues with the devs  being both have a storied history of making award winning games in multiple genres. tomb raider being no exception  and the reviews had weren t based on just graphics alone.
yup. fan made recreations of the games are the only way now.
what they dont seem to learn is that we will cancel them for pushing this trash by not buying and then universally panning it online and in reviews. they seem to not care initially but when they ve ruined a franchise and the money is noticeably absent  they always backpedal and beg us to buy their shit
I just knew something like this would happen when they hired cod vanguard s narrative designer to be the next writer  I check her resume and she is clearly didn t had enough of experience. she probably got the job through nepotism.
excellent I also sent an email to embracer group and crystal dynamics so that they take the correct measures and eliminate all that garbage that is not tomb raider. because if they do  their investment and future game will have many havoc and negative consequences.
both groups are basically the same though. I dont know anyone but a narrsistic psychopath that needs to see themselves in their characters.
damn they hired vangaurds narrativr designer   vanguard was such a bad game and they re letting this donut write one of the greatest ip s next game  ! why cant they just get the previous writer back
vanguard s writer  what a joke and so was that game. didn t she get kicked out of that kotor remake that got canned a week ago just get the writer who wrote the 2013 game and rise.
@_maz_ter_  yes!! we need rihanna pratchett back she s the one who wrote the comics and games of tr 2013 and rise except shadow and thats probably the reason why most people disliked shadow s plot story
@chickencurry  yeah the game definitely took a nose dive compared to the previous 2 games  even if they took inspiration from uncharted. I d rather have uncharted within tomb raider than croft with crippling depression  lesbian relationship out of the blue and some tomb desecration academy.
she wouldn t be doing hookups either  no one would be worthy of her body. in their freaking dreams
lara croft should never has any sexual interest in   like anyone regardless of their orientation  throughout the whole series there only mild flirt between she and kurt in angel of darkness   outside that game there s never any love interest in it and I really hope them keep it that way .
@orange chicken  100  agree. even hunky larson tried to  badly  flirt with her and it was immediately shut down  I like that about lara.
have you played the reboot  the chemistry between lara and sam is not friendly... its so much more.the comic writers even wanted to have her share a kiss with sam.
@rathalos  played the reboot  however did not pick up on that vibe. doesnt make the game any better tho
Imean  I think this lara is still the reboot lara not the classic lara. ...when did she leave people for dead again  I haven t played every tomb raider game known to man  I only started at tomb raider legend and watched some bits of the older games. and in the trilogy I got  she has 2 partners  one of em dead in tr  underworld. ..eh  she was probably a loner in the rest of the games until now. oh  and I remember  she left amanda for dead at the end of underworld. but who else did she even leave
...also sexuality doesnt really define her. she could have a gf that works with her in a completely different setting than where lara currently could be. sorry  Im just confused.
eh  nevermind  screw it. xd I ll stick with legend lara. she s badass and her voice is warm. uwu
I agree  lara croft is intelligent  confident  sassy and a lone wolf... not a lesbian woman who wants to be loved by another woman.her work will always be more important for herself than these boyfriends or girlfriends.but now they can make natla and amanda love triangle
romance or any sort of relationship drama or even shippings was never a thing in tomb raider and should never be. tr has always been about puzzles  action  adventure and exploration. the fact they ve added such element starting with the reboot trilogy  and want to go even deeper with what the latest game might be shows they re aiming for different kind of audience  think last of us 2  and further drifting from fans of the older tr games.
I personally wanna see some lesbian action. it pleases me.
yeah its disgusting that they would do this to a character. most gamers are straight males. we know why they re doing this and we know what the fallout will be. Im done with this series. I have too many games to play as it is
@firefly  excuse me  Im a queer women and having a queer lara would literally be the best thing ever. I dont care about men.
@goro majima  no
I dont know  kind of aligns with the story. she let her daddy issues go at the end of shadow. I feel like she can still be passionate about what she does but I would definitely expect her to have issues with being lonely. that being said  realistically  she would have a lot of issues with relationships due to how much time she has spent being a loner. Imay be a little bias though  I am all about representation and would love to she her in a lesbian relationship. a relationship that wouldn t need any context to  why  she was a lesbian and simply found a person she was interested in.
@mrbust  thats what rule34 is for

dude raider.
larry croft
sadly that wasn t the point. the reboot was made by people that hated the originals and everything about who lara was. this reboot was their own version of the character shaped how they wanted her. and now they re straying even further from the character. it got woke and I dont see the original coming back soon sadly.
if they end up releasing a game based on what is leaked  I am done with tr. I wont be supporting anything else these woke psychos create. they destroyed the original lara croft. Im so mad  I cant even think straight. damn it  they had to go and destroy our childhoods  didn t they
if they cant take criticism and alter their product to the fans  desires then they are not interested in the fans  money they want people who just consume their product  dont ask questions  and wait for the next product.
this is truly unfortunate. truly this is the end of tomb raider for me
so. . . .basically trying to represent everyone. . . .except the actual lara croft tomb raider fans  yeah thatsounds about right
pretty good and informative video. I had those fears for a long time. now its nearly official! it was totally clear they aimed to make lara croft a ellie 2.0. when she was a original in the first place.. its saddened and she was as much a childhoodhero for me  as she was for you tho.even if im just 25.I loved the classic games and played them  when I was like 7-8.im so horribly against this.anyway  may God bless you  dear melonie!
mel  you cant turn gta into a game about feeding the homeless!!! netflix  hold my kombucha
when they said they were unifying the timelines I was expecting something a lot different then this. of course we dont have deeper story details yet or how much from the classic games will be included besides the fact that in this universe those adventures from the classic series exist but that just might be the only way they are incorporated into this game. I want to see the classic games matter and part of the modern tomb raider universe so bad but they need to bring back the correct lara character and formula. the one from the classic games. I really thought they were going to create a new or add on story connected to one of the classic games or continue story elements and lara s character from aod. or create a whole new adventure set in the world or in the style of at least the first 5 games with some classic characters returning to help fill the story. I wish! what s so hard cd about honoring tomb raiders past. especially since its the era where most of the fans came from. they kinda are making a story where the classic games happened. but the leaks about the story that we have so far with lara just seem way off. she s a bad azz and she would not feel lonely. its not her character. she s too strong of a woman to care to feel lonely. she s got winston and her sport. at least in the last revelation it was set up for in aod and the scraped trilogy thatshe lost her strength and was slowly getting it back as well as those events setting her up to become depressed. which they were going to explore if the tomb raider aod trilogy wasn t canceled. not sure how or if it ll be done right with the way they will portray this loneliness thing and lara being gay. Im gay and I dont think I want her to be cause she s never been that way the entire series.
completely agree about the reboot bait and switch. they tricked us with that last scene of the first game where lara uses her 2 pistols. but that was it. she never used them together again.
I had to be under nda back when I was in movies. we want these awesome larger than life characters. not people like us. Im afraid they will make lara croft old and she ll run a tomb raider academy for gifted youngsters. while riding around in a yellow hoverchair that looks like a bumper car and all the fake fans will love it. Im sorry melonie. I wish you could get your favorite  beloved  franchise back. keep speaking your mind melonie and keep rocking. still praying for you.
Im literally heartbroken I truly had hope that I was getting my lara back  its cruel teasing the unification of the lara s when its just nathan drake with a ponytail again  its upsetting.
I appreciate your take.  I feel like if they really wanted to take her character in a totally different direction  they could create a new  heroine  and a completely different game apologies if you happened to mention that in the video  I tend to multitask while listening . there s a ton of potential and they would have a clean slate to work on.  a large part of lgtbq  fans were influenced by lara s character for exactly that  the fantasy. most people are smart enough to ignore the murders and stealing because its literally fiction. like you said I always saw her as a lone wolf  0 interest in romantic relationships and has always meant business. she s a cold-hearted  extremely intelligent and powerful athlete who stops at nothing to get what she wants. in 2018 there was that talk of an independent re-make of tr2 the dagger of xian using the same engine as legend I think. only the demo of the great wall is available to play but Ive never seen any other updates
you are 100  right! lara was always a loner   focused on her work   never cared about relationships. I sure hope they scrap all this  but you know how it is they re gonna do whatever they want  even if the fans dont like it. they dont care about the fans anyways! anything tomb raider I always come to you on here because youre ms. tomb raider. whether its legit or not you are my  1 source when it comes to anything lara croft related. keep up the great work mel  we love ya girl!!!!
a large part of what makes a person a psychopath is lack or diminished fear and anxiety or lack of or diminished empathy and remorse. there s no such thing as mistakes for a psychopath. so its very easy to make an argument for her being a psychopath. not many people would be able to just flip their parents off and continue on with life the way lara does after being disowned by their parents and also not many people would be willing to face the amount of dangers and risk the way she does.on another note  to me  lara croft that has had even a fingerprint from square enix and crystal dynamics is not lara croft. its just a lara croft wannabe that crystal dynamics found off the streets. this is not lara croft. its nathania drake because she ll always be a second rate version of nathan drake instead of a first rate version of herself. as far as Im concerned  the real lara croft died a long time ago. which makes sense to have a short lived life for someone with diminished fear and anxiety on the same level as lara croft.
I spoke out against this on twitter and I got no end of harassment including being called a homophobe despite that Im a gay man.
you just got a new fan. I was 11 when I played tomb raider a first time  and now Im 35. crystal dynamics changed my childhood idol more and more with every reboot  and not in a good way. yes  their games and fun to play and I like the most gameplay mechanics  but lara is unrecognizable -- and she s the most important part.thank you of being the voice of many fans.
legend was nice  improvement  and even underworld had more longer levels but anniversary was our last shot at seeing lara croft as she was in the classic before 2013 lara. it had the legend feel  but tried to bring back the classic style of gameplay. the only game that did something new but kept the original classic feel was the 10th anniversary game that I really wished they finished. people were more excited about that game then the entire reboot trilogy.
been waiting all week for you to make a vid on this. I d love to post it on the forum  but you know how the admin likes to instaban. Im so relieved the backlash has been huge  but crystal have been tone deaf for years about what fans want  so even with the backlash I doubt anything will change. they have their heads too far up their butts.
its not the easy thing but speaking your mind is the right thing. youre not calling for hate  youre not calling out a specific individual. youre speaking about something you ve had passion for most your life. never back down  never surrender.
I really liked this vid. Im 100  with u on the progressive woke infection taking place across culture. by infection I basically just mean forcing their views onto everyone else. honestly this news is pretty discouraging about lara  devastating actually. I really hope there will be a creative group out there in lara s future who s passion is creating genuine stories and adventures out of creativity not woke narratives.same with movies  people were once free to create stories. now its all propaganda with small creative variations. keep speaking out! perhaps lara can still be rescued from the agenda. my faith is pretty small in that one but im hoping!
I could not agree more with you! I liked the first two games in the reboot series but I never thought of them as a  tomb raider  game. lara croft just felt like a whole different person for my brain to associate her with her original character. Im like you  I started playing tomb raider when I was around 9-10 y o  im 30 now and the last game I really loved was lara croft go. keep your integrity!
they destroying everything. as a gay dude Im tired of this woke shit and forced inclusions. and lara have no time to be in a serious relationship.
I kinda suspected it would go this way because why would they bother with the old lara ever again....
they didn t destroy your childhood  just play the originals  they ll always exist and there re plenty of them. for me lara died in the egyptian tomb of set.
@shimon novotny  I ll just play the fan remakes at this point. the new games were just tr in name anyway.
you almost had it right. they re not about the money but they re about pushing  the message
crystal dynamics never knew what is a tomb raider game.they never wanted to give the old feeling to the fans because they hate the old fans. our reviews and critics doesnt matter anymore because they want a new fanbase and the new games prove that.they dont want to grow under core design s sun and thats why they are so... idiots
there also pretty dang proud of themselves for ruining every single protagonists story
not the kombucha. God damn.
honestly a situation where og lara has to run a school for gifted youngsters would be hilarious. she would not be as far as I canthink of a  good mother figure . where s mom  oh  she left on a business trip  she should be back sometime next month  so who wants to order the pizza
@g vnhtsm  honestly I dont know if she would be a great mother  Imean based on her character you would say no. we all know of course in reall life women often change when they get pregnant  but for the story I wouldnt want to lara as a mom. I quess the only exception I would be ok with it  if its a daughter who wants to step into her moms footsteps. and I dont mind her to be a bit different as long as it makes sense.
I hate this whole  characters need to be just like us  bs. I dont need hollywood to respresent me because I represent myself.
its not even nathan drake. at least nathan drake is entertaining and charismatic. this rebooted lara croft is none of those things.
@ricoseattle  you know its bad when  dude raider  has better qualities than lara croft
its not like she ever liked men.
@the slithering peanut  you clearly missed my point or just didn t read my comment at all.
@the slithering peanut  what s a man got to do to get thatsorta attention from ya   its hard to say exactly. but you seem to be doing fine.
lara croft died with core design...
big yikes  thatsucks. what exactly did you say
@james hamlin  I only said that lara doesnt need any kind of relationship. then some guy called me a homophobe. at this point they deleted their replies so unfortunately its gone and I think that person blocked me as well.
its twitter my guy  the cesspool of social media  you should have seen that coming.
@prodigal_rebel_20  of course. stay off of twitter man  fuck those bots.
and thats what happens for having an opinion that goes against  the message   no matter who you are
its time to just stop purchasing woke games or watching woke hollywood low energy re-hashes and let these franchises die off with the hopes they comeback in a few years minus the bullshit. great video mel
I was so waiting for this  evan here! first of all  I so agree with eveyrthing you said  everything. I will open my heart and share my view and what worries me the most. as many hardcore fans thatstarted the saga with the first game back 1996  tomb raider defined and changed my life on a huge way. we are all in this pretty much togheter  as any 90  kid   we know what lara is for us now and what she meant back then.when cd came into the scene  we were happy for many reasons. but when tr2013 was announced  there was a huge division. I was absolutely thrilled and was trying to be positive and supportive because of one thing they made clear at some extent   that was their origin story for lara croft. the reason behind was because lara was a  teflon beauty . ok  got it  discussion aside I understood their point and decided it to give it a go. there was some highs and lows  but in the end we know it was going to stop at some point. this support was from day 1 to the sotr launch   around a whole decade of dedicating a huge part of my life contributing to keep the fire alive among others  cause I love lara and tr.when they announced the unification  I was thrilled. I thought  omg finally its going to happen  she will be back  . and now this leaks....oh my dear Lord.when you think about batman  despite the many years and variations on portrays of all kinds of media  there s one thing in common  he is an orphan  he s a detective  he s millionaire and he s driven by revenge  even not killing people. now  imagine if someone decided to recast batman  and I am not talking about alternative universes  but main media where they decide what s canon and stuff  as a religious fanatic  who s no longer a millionaire but a middle class man who founds out he s adopted and want to find out who their biological parents are   and his favourite colour is white. but somehow  thats a new light over a pretty known character and he eventually will become that batman that you always loved.that is exacly what happened with lara croft and tomb raider. the ammount of excused they used to re-invent a freakin cultural icon  because even my grandmom know who lara croft is  was so intrincated that I decided to buy it. lara was somehow built under a misoginistic light due to her big boobs and sexy outfits and so they went for the girl next door  someone you can relate type for giving her a more human and less female-degrading treatment. ok  gotcha . then  it turned into a lot  of family drama because she s a human being and of course  being an action heroin needs justification if you are a female  otherwise it doesnt make sense.  ok  gotcha.now  and let s pray that nothing of this is more than a scrapped script  because it would definitely be the last nail on lara s coffin. its like  after going through the batman example Imade before  they said   we listened and we are going to move forward making an unification of the classic and the revamped version   and then going for a script that hints batman feeling depressed for having a lot of money and looking for help of altruistic millonaires for making of gotham a better place. oh  and he will identify as a they them. but if you say anything agains that  you are homophobic  or whatever excuse.I could continue for ages. but I wont open the gates of hell because I have a glimpse of hope that this is non-existing anymore and that tomb raider will  be back to be more to its roots. however  I do find plausible that this   at some extent  will be true for obvious reasons. and its super sad and ironic that lara  being an archaeologist herself  is still trapped like she was in 1999 when the pyramid collapsed because her legacy is not respected. she s being questioned all the time  not for being sexy and having big breast like if that was something horrible and automatically makes you less of a woman  but because her true essence of character  independence  bravery  courage  inteligence  unapologetic  is something that for some reason  they refuse to explore  expand and celebrate.
at this point... I want melonie to be lara croft. I think if given the freedom  she can really pull it together and bring it back to the golden age.
mel  you have some good takes on these  quality of life  changes  possibly  for lara croft. so here s mine 1  a protector of antiquities  Ive allways looked at her in that way  sorta. when you see her giving some treasures to her financial benefactors  I imagine she did homework   knows they ll protect those artifact. sometime turns sideways  she d just break in   take em back!2  her height - I agree  she should be tall and muscular. character model size could be altered easily before game goes gold if its true. we just petition.  she s lesbian   ...who cares  they cant stop me fantasizing about her if I want  I do care if they make lara act clingy to anybody  except her dad . like u said mel- adrenaline is her sex passion  she can feel nurturing for her  crew   but thats only cuz she wants them to be as strong as her. she just needs to be like ash in pokemon- catch em all !God bless you and yours  melonie.
keep up the great work  melonie! God bless you!
I grew up playing the core games  I didn t mind the new trilogy but  the original core games  the entire vibe just keeps me going back to them.  I didn t think crystal dynamics were involved anymore  they really need to give the franchise to someone who understands who lara is.
lara croft   no!  you cant!  that belongs in a museum!   tips fedora
the loneliness could turn into her ambition too raid tombs alone and enjoy the loneliness with selfishness  I hope they do go back to the roots as its what we know! I loved the reboot personally  but from the nostalgia side I understand why people are not liking the root they re taking x
what you are describing lara croft used to be and what s she s becoming sounds a lot like carmem sandiego. its crazy how similar they are  being power fantasies in a way  and robbers that take what they want for the thrill. they are both  not heroes .  now carmen is different too. nice nail polish  by the way!
I had read comics about tomb raider  where lara was in relationships with men. but it always among to nothing because lara ended up killing them because they were in the way or in a bad position  which got them kill. at the end of the day  I would say that lara is best alone.
I suspected as much. making lara lesbian is the nail in the coffin for me. its forced  its meant to strip away her appeal to men  its dumb. if this goes through  the franchise is over for me.the part about working with a group of other inspired  tomb raiders  is dumb too  and I bet it will be the launch-pad for multiplayer  mtx incoming  . there s just one problem. l a r a     y o u   r e   n o t   p a r t   o f   t h e   g r o u p .    lara is not oliver queen.
Im not sure if the embracer group is going to do too much about crystal dynamics and the franchise. they have such a hands-off approach with the companies and ips they buy. thats why many people weren t aware of them until the square enix deal  even though they ve been buying up studios for years.
the leaked tr has massive alarm bells ringing. if it is real let s hope the reactions prompts a complete rethink.
its a breath of fresh air to finally see someone who produces content like this say they refuse to play or engage in something they dont want.  I see so many other content creators complain about the same things and then they go and play the game anyways under the guise of  I played it for you all .   I have personally passed on so many games  movies  ect. because I dont agree with what was done.
part of me hopes that they re just testing the waters with this leak to see how the fan reaction will go  and will scrap the leaked concept eventually.then I remember that crystal dynamics is a bay area studio  insulated in a bubble where all these major studios jerk each other off and repeat how brilliant they are so that part about them copying the last of us 2 sounds very plausible  since its now held as a holy grail in   cinematic experience   game development.
its interesting that the proposed changes  in most franchises  are stated as being for the fans and yet it is the fans themselves that will say that they neither asked for or like the divergent changes  sure slight changes here and there are par for the course  but when you make sweeping changes to something you can end up changing what it intrinsically is. there is a reason something becomes successful in the first place and if the makers are lucky enough to create something that makes it through the cacophony of ip s that are out there then thatshould be treasured for what it is because it is that very reason that they became successful in the first place as apposed to something else it would stand to reason that turning it into one of the other things runs the risk of making it unsuccessful as they are. trying to infiltrate a successful ip and alter it from the inside just to garner its pre-existing following or fandom and subvert it from the inside you might aswell create another ip and see if that flies although that would carry with it an apparent risk of greater or immediate failure  aswell as the extra time and tenacity involved to build it up  you might aswell do it though as if the alteration of an existing ip fails then you have esentially brought down two ip s the existing one  which you most likely cannot get back to an original glory once the fans have soured and moved on from aswell as your own which you now know wouldn t have worked as proved while not risking your own idea.
personally my dream tomb raider game is lara being too adventurous and too curious thatshe accidentally gets caught up in a secret   elite organization   and gets to explore and solve their meeting locations   the things they have done and etc and as a result she gets discovered and gets on their red list and has to flee the country   basically she goes a bit too far with her appeal for adventure and biting more than she can chew but she loves it at the end   she s not trying to save anyone   she s not trying to destroy this organization  she isn t working for the greater good   she s just curious and wants the adventure
why does everything have to be  grounded  now
sorry melonie I knew it was gonna happen to lara  cheer up though still have a lot of fun stuff out therewe took a hit to battletech as well when they went after blaine pardoe and got him fired  the community is rallying around himthe lara of old is gone but at least the classic games are still there which is what we are doing in battletechnot giving them a dime is the only way to affect change and getting other stuff thats just as good as old tomb raider dont give money to people who hate you and want to silence you
you cant change grand theft auto to a game of feeding the homeless  Im dead.
it was time to stop giving them money ages ago. its just taking a long time for some people to figure that out.
@knowbody  its so frustrating and upsetting when they were never seemingly into whatever they destroy....insert liar kevin smith and how he pretended to like he man....and wrecked it. he had the nerve to attack anyone saying it would be woke shit....
@majin stavros  not sure how the guy who played silent bob became such an apologist for woke ideology.
the pendulum is swinging. wokeness is dying  look at the small victories like the cancelation of batgirl and things like the antiwoke comic company ripperverse emerging. this nightmare will soon be over.
I agree... thats why I wont be watching the lotr amazon abomination.
there s tons of people who still give these companies money.
to be fair top gun maverick is like the best movie ever made
ahh thank you so much  I appreciate you!
yeah read some of those too .and she was never a lesbian
she never should have any love interest in the first place   she s always been a lone wolf  being with someone whether its a guy or a girl feels really out of place for this franchise.
I dont mind lara s being in a relationship as long as its chase carver hehe
which in on itself would feel extremely out of place and nonsensical  since not even survivor lara ever showed a preference for women.the closest thing to a preference she showed was when she kissed alex on endurance.
im pretty sure that was their intention in this reboot.hell   even the 95  of her outfit in the last game screams thatshe was gonna be lesbian   every game lara was less female looking. Im pretty sure she gonna have half head shaved for her new game and she be looking like abby from tlou 2
me too man
well said brother. stay strong fellow battletech fan.
God help lara croft. I genuinely might actually rage if they bring sam back as a love interest. I genuinely dont want lara to be in a relationship. the only thing she can be in a relationship with is her work etc as you mentioned. lara needs to go back to the classic play for sports badass again. Im so over this dry  dramatic storytelling and characters that crystal has been giving us. og lara has a lot more character and they refuse to give it us. Im praying that they actually scrapped this or reworked it. but Ive not got much hope left until we actually see something worthy.
Im officially done with aaa western industry and moved onto japanese and indie scene now. I suggest you do the same melonie  -
I agree with you melonie. to add to that  if they are going to screw up the character this much the last thing they will do is bring back lara s duel pistols and that is a must as far as Im concerned. hard pass on this purchase.
I think its time tomb raider be developed by an indie studio because as long as the franchise is in the hands of these big studios we will always have to suffer this nonsense.
this isn t lara at all  might have as well just created a completely new character.
Im not going to argue with you on this as I think you are right on all points. one thing I have learned though is never to get too excited about video games  especially when its just a trailer. they should bring back demo releases  take a portion of the game  release it for free on every platform  let gamers get a feel for the game first  take the comments based on the demo than make the proper adjustments before releasing the full game.
the anime will help a lot on the true direction they re going with the franchise  since it will be cannon.also I feel like this is an early rough draft cause the leaker said that he been holding the script for quite some time. and cd is still hiring writers for the game.
cant wait for them to ruin lara croft in the next game like they are going to do with a future hollywood film franchise. thats cool at least I still have the og games though  lol
if they are unifying the timelines what if she falls in love with another version of herself  would that narcissism be in character for the original versions of the character
personally I dont want lara in any kind of relationship. Ive never seen her as the type of woman interested in dating relationships.
I think a super-confident person like lara would  if anything  probably be bI - because she doesnt care about a detail like gender. just if she likes someone or not. and doesnt care about anyone elses opinion or moral standards. having said that - like many other here I think lara is just kind of the  lone wolf  type of character. with maybe some very few  friends  who occasionally help out  but its hard for me to imagine her in a romantic relationship with anyone while she s supposed to roam the world and  well  raid some tombs.I already hate  hate  hate how much of a pussy she has become in the new games. constantly whining about her situation  or about her poor daddy  whenever she sits down at a camp fire... that annoyed me so much. and in the last game  at one point she became really hysterical about how she caused something bad to happen to a village  even though she was hardly to blame for any of it . at that moment  I wished I could slap her myself  and yell at her  shut the fuck up  youre supposed to be a badass  Goddammit . they are really making it hard for me to still root for lara.
itsounds a bit conspiratorial but I really hope that this leak was just a way for crystal enix to sneakily get some feedback on where they need to take the next tomb raider. Imean I doubt that thats true but it would be cool if they were to just listen to the people who have been playing tr for the past 26 years and then adapt lara accordingly!
why cant they just make her asexual  wasn t that what she was from the beginning   I never cared about her love life I dont know why they are so consumed with that leave her love life alone if anything leave thatshit to the fandom or rule 34  leave it outside of the main line games.
I left a comment for sacred symbols on monday where Imentioned melonie mac  so its a weird coincidence seeing melonie talking about them a few days later. I ll just copy and paste my comment over here since its still applicable  Ive never played a classic tomb raider game before  but Ive been watching videos from the internet s lara croft expert  melonie mac  and have learned enough about the franchise to know the script already sounds nothing like classic lara. ever since the reboot  itseems like the writers have been falling all over themselves to show how selfless  caring  and morally good lara croft is. her only character trait is thatshe seems to be a super nice lady who helps people  which translates to a boring protagonist.
lara isn t gay. end of story. awesome vid by the way
18 00  the idea of a team is good for me  because can lead to more puzzly gameplay - at least for lara croft series. but they cant be superheroes. the more they are fragile or less competent the more they would need each other  generating complex opportunities. see the superb example of dragon age 2   which had an intimidating highest difficulty  forcing you to have a well coordinated group. each fight was a challenging puzzle!19 23  I personally dont like the idea of pushing bad morale on my throat. if so  it would be better if she was a robot instead  programmed to do bad things.22 26  the critic must try to extract the truth  or as much as possible  regardless of the feelings from others  because this is simply not related to the subject.
wow!! I cant believe I didn t subscribe to you sooner! I like your sincerity and I agree with everything you said in this video!! it is rare that I agree with every word so Im happy to subscribe!!
im straight  but I always saw her as asexual. she doesnt care for romance and all that crap. she d be like that fun aunt that comes back to visit once every year and brings home some crazy stories and souvenirs. I dont even know why we have to label her  why are labels so important to people these days is beyond me
Im gonna stick with classic tomb raider games for the ps1  ps2   ps3  thank you very much
this is about as much of a mess as disney has made with star wars.
I was expecting her to get with sam at the end of the first game
I actually thought about learning game development to make tr  competitor.  but thats probably a distant dream.
stepford lara
yes we do. in fact  we are probably getting some of the older games ported to switch. if those are half-way decent ports  I ll probably snag those and call it.
hopefully they can remaster the older ones with ue5 and release them on pc and switch
romance or any sort of relationship drama or even shippings was never a thing in tomb raider and should never be. tr has always been about action  puzzles  adventure and exploration. the fact they ve added such element starting with the reboot trilogy  and want to go even deeper with what the latest game might be shows they re aiming for different kind of audience  think last of us 2  and further drifting from fans of the older tr games.
I dont mind if she a lesbian  I d be heart broken if another man took her instead of me.
this!!!
@mrbust  I agree with you haha
whether its a girl or a guy   lara being with someone feels very out of place for this franchise . she s a lone wolf raids ancient tombs for sport   she enjoys being alone in an undiscovered civilization  she never had any relationship and I wish they would keep it that way.
the reboot lara might be or whatever the new  woke  lara is.
dont forget disney marvel and dc comics. thats the real pandemic
Im fine with her being humanised to a degree  if they gave her a pet the way doom guy had daisy the rabbit  I d be fine with it. it gives the impression of some humanity and its also humorous.but no human love interest please!
agree on everything you said  and Im one of those lgbtq  fans. why lara should even have a relationship in the first place
protector of artifacts   bruh in anniversary characters entry for pierre they said he tampers with artifacts and that lara is also accused of doing the same thing. lara doesnt protect artifacts she doesnt care she is in it for sport. she shares similarities with the   bad guys   she ain t no hero that cd is pushing her to be.
makes sense. ordinary and relatable is today s trend  not the power fantasy ideal. these leaks seem to be in line with the way most stories are made these days  so I wouldn t be surprised if they are true.
recently found you. absolutely love you.  you show those woke crazies what fer by g.   o.    d.
I bought tomb raider underworld the other day. after not liking the reboot trilogy I wanted to play the older stuff to see if they were all like that   the new ones   cuz I saw a lot of potential. God are the older games fun. she s dual welding pistols and sideflipping whilst shooting. its fun. its badass. we need more of that
I honestly wish I knew how to do game coding  because I really would love to do a tomb raider game and remain faithful to lara croft. I did try out unreal engine 5 which has two different types of coding  the one which strings things together  may seem simple enough. though it is not for those like myself with a learning disability  to learn. yes  I have learned how to use sketchup  though it is even for me at least not all that hard to learn  but I do realise and take into account that for some people it isn t so easy. which brings me to the point of what is easy for one person or a few  does not always mean however  that it is easy for another person or another group of people. after all  we are individual human beings  yet game making programs  while not all of them  are designed by people in  the know  for people in the know and not for anyone else. dont get me wrong  I honestly appreciate the complexities for both game design and game coding. what I am trying to say  it is a real shame that there is not something almost similar to sketchup  but is not sketchup  where not only can a person build models  they can also make games too with the coding already built into the software somehow and all a person needs to do is to select that coding  put that like in a panel  then have another one next to it with another set of coding  etc. it most likely may not work that way  but one can only wish. the best that I could do was as near to it  a game like design in the form of a set of rooms  yes  I know that isn t impressive  but it was what I could do at the time and I am still learning new things about how to use sketchup  so maybe Imight be able to do better. I certainly hope so  thatsaid  even sketchup has its own limitations  probably for good reasons  like to keep it as near possible  simple and easy to use.
of course they are doing this....absolutley ridiculous
I am not sure if the problems is with the details of the personality of the character. yes  the rebooted lara was far from the original version of herself but even when I was playing the old games I was not thinking that much of her individuality. it was more the atmosphere of the game that was making everything. searching old caverns  making crazy  and hard  jumps or solving hard puzzles to go to the next area and then find abondontemple with long forgotten artifact. and the soundtrack which is so iconic for all of the old games. and now we have easy cinematic games with no puzzels at all and big focus on the gunfights. in my opinion it is just the lack of creativity that is ruining everything. the  woke  narrative is only used to follow the mainstream and not to be  cancelled  before the new games are even releised. cd will abondon any political or other messege only to be sure that they will have enough profit from the game. and will not care to change the core of it for the modern expectations. its the profit put over the art which is destroing all the classic franchises. we can see it with assassins creed  resident evil  although they have some good hits there   ghost recon etc. back then it was gamers creating for gamers  now is business companies trying to gain as much as possible.
I can see lara croft working with other tomb raiders -- if she s calling the shots. I can see her having romantic scenes with someone -- if she returns to her first  and only true  love which is tomb raiding. she can be like james bond and romance someone  but the nature of her work and lifestyle means the romance never lasts longer than a night or so. there are ways to develop this character with these new elements and keep her essence the same.I never saw lara as particularly tall or muscular or physically intimidating -- fit  yes. angelina jolie was a good match for her in terms of physicality. what she brings to the table is skill and experience. a lot of the men who confront her underestimate her  until they fuck around and find out. her ability to deal with danger without the advantage of raw brute strength is what makes her cool and amazing.now samus aran is supposed to be over 6 ft tall and strong af -- before the power suit augmentations kick in.
I feel so sad about what they did to my favorite game  tomb raider is living with me since 1998  and it was the reason that I entered video game development  I hate what cristal dynamic with the game  and I hope tomb raider will be taking from them.
oh God  Im glad I wasn t alone in thinking cd was inspired by the last of us.
8 50 I wouldn t mind the original lara doing this  she s the lovem and leavem type of girl. it would have been playful and cheeky. now I try not to imagine the melodramatic dross the writers will come up with. after laras shadow transformation I can only assume the game will involve you sitting in a padded room having a nice cry.
I have recently started buying more retro games that I haven t played before  because out of touch developers have been destroying one gaming franchise after another lately  saints row  gta  etc. . I think we were previously in the golden ages of gaming.
why I ll be happy with any new tr content. I was really hoping we d get the classic lara persona with survivor era gameplay tidbits. I couldn t care less about character fodder being in the story to make us care about
ideally the next tomb raider game will feature actual puzzles  climbing  and block pulling. its just not the same if lara doesnt have a gun in each hand.
you could tell towards the end of the her video that melonie is very bummed out! when she talked about no one likes to be the bad guy I thought of tony montana. haha   now say good night to the bad guy!
from my point of view  the tomb raider devs should do what io interactive and id software did to hitman and doom back in 2016.go back to the core of the liscence. tr needs a profound introspection to find back what was apealing back then.stop making tr an underwealming uncharted experience.
feels like they wann kill of lara with those new tomb raiders replacing her within the following titles. like step beside lara your legacy will be carried by generic character  3 from now on. and I feel they will do this because they wanna get rid of her as a character they dont like her it doesnt fit in there world view    strong  powerful  attractive ..... woman   but because the character is to strong to just change they have to come up with some bs like that. she inspired so many tomb raiders that we will have to follow the characters crystal dynamics really wants to make   boring ones
when I heard the news I knew immediately which channel I need to check out. knew youre gonna have a field day with this crap
yup  its good marketing in my opinion.
the classics are even better than underworld too  youre in for a treat if you play those  Imade a tweet the other day with good widescreen mods linked
@melonie mac go boom  fan since the 90s and I love classic sooo much but underworld is my favorite. sue me. lol.
I see what youre saying. for me with cd first trilogy  I didn t care about all thatstuff as I just wanted more tr. I feel they did a good job. I know some people dont like some of the elements themes of tr lau but to me the bone of the franchise were there. with this newer reboot  it was like wtf  they are good as generic adventure games  but they are not tomb raider games. one of my recent favorite franchises has become the little nightmares games. I   iI were developed by tasier studios with bandi-namco as the publisher. tasier said they are done but bandI own the rights and made it very clear they will likely continue. I am scared now and I can only imagine this is how many classic core fans must have felt back in the day. with these small indie studios its all passion and art. then the publishers get there claws in it and its all     . it happens with so many other things. which is why I sometimes think band s demos are better than the actual lp we get once they get with a label.
@mydnyghtamethyst  absolutely! it was the same with me when I was playing legend  underworld and anniversery. the tr spirit was there. and then 2013 was just other game  defently not tr. it was only the name. same with the indie games also. recently I am buying mostly games created by small studios. sometimes even if I am not that big fan of the game itslef but just to aupport them. things like far  lone sails  bastion etc. are just pure art.
youre right. I saw it earlier tho. ps3 was the golden era that overflowed into ps4 a little and that was it. everything is online multiplayer now and clogged with mtx
saints row seems fine to me
lovable rogue - thats the stereotype lara falls into.think han solo... a guy who lives his life breaking the law. making money through illegal means.  but  just like lara  does not want to kill people or commit crimes that directly hurt other people.  they both have a human caring side and a sense of honour.
not even jeff ross can save this game.
hImelanie itseems many ofthese companies for gamesthinks nothing at all about the people who been playingthese games for many years.they ll just keep putting these many other games only in their views.thank u for alwaysbringing these many othertopics to its centerpoint yourthe best melanie until next video.takecare melanie
I cant tell if its another reboot of the series  or if it follows the survivor timeline  because I really love the current reboot.yes  its not the lara croft we know and love  big boobs  big ass  anti-hero and perfect tomb raider  but this reboot was a fresh start and I loved it  but now that her  maturation cycle  has been completed  I would love to see the true badass lara croft take her place  in the survivor timeline. relationships and romance is fine  but only if it fits her and her story  even if that ends up resulting in the romance being burnt out  aka not an option. it has to fit the character. she s had her drama and family stuff resolved. having small bits of family focus history is fine  but its time for either the survivor timeline or whatever to make lara increasingly badass!but there s the very big risk they re just going to fuck it all up... I dearly hope they dont.
melonie mac  you are a nice and a friendly person ! if someone doesent like what you say about tomb raider and lara croft  dont sweat it  we the fans of tombraider will always have your back. we will allways be here ! you will never be alone !  not in youtube
Im glad youre not a part of the development team Im loving the new lara gen
agreed completely. to think that we ve given them 10 years at this point  and still the real lara is nowhere to be seen
also makes me worried about perfect dark reboot
I totally agree with you melonie  lara croft was meant to be this unatainable power phatasy character that was a rebellious type of person. also I wish if crystal dynamics would give lara her upper and lower melons back to make her powerfull  -
I actually liked the reboot series thus far  despite not being classic lara  but shadow is enough of an ending that if the new one is woke  I can safely ignore it.
the rebooted tomb raider games are so incredibly awesome the only thing that Im hoping for is that the new tomb raider game releases on the xbox series s
sup melonie  Im new to your channel and think youre awesome. imagine my surprise and happiness when I saw you had the name  gojira  on your arm in japanese! stay beautiful and awesome!!!
if they make lara gay  Im going back in the closet. this is too much!!!
game companies and game devs that continuously go against the wishes of the majority of the fans dont deserve the franchises that they have. them taking all the info down proves to me that the leaks were real.
the irony is that in a multiverse this actually could go right.... but  its cd s story writing we re talking about sooo....
itseems every one of these entertainment companies from gaming to movies  makes every decision based on spite for the core fanbase.
stuff like this makes me worry about a legacy of kain revival.
congrats on making tyler zed s show! boom!
lara croft go was so much fun. its really what I want in a tomb raider game.
who are they pandering to that dont buy nor play any of these games
the reboot trilogy is woke as heck too lol
@melonie mac go boom  not as much  tbf. lolgranted  I liked them mainly because they played closer to uncharted  which I love.prior to 4  that is.
the first tomb raider from the reboot was my favourite.
oh my loool
to be honest  angel of darkness is one of my favourites  3  4   angel of darkness and then legend  but I couldn t see lara and that dude as a romantic thing. he was more like a friend or somehting. I liked him  got sad at the end. but I do agree the romantical thing with a guy or a girl is not the thing with tomb raider. I kinda miss the giant statues  dragons  dinossaurs....
I dont mind lara being into women  but I just dont see her in a romantic relationship in general. I feel like if they felt like possibly making her bI or something  I would have liked to see a sarcastic lara that makes flirty jokes with both male and female characters  just not with actual intent to start a relationship or anything. Imiss the charm of the more humorous  sarcastic versions of her in more classic games.
Lord why cant they just give the fans what they want. canthey focus on the adventure and not lara as a person
as someone that recently is getting into the old ps3 tomb raider games the one thing I dont understand is why did cd change the game so much when they did the reboot tomb raider games  the ps3 games seem like a great middle ground for both players of the franchise. like for me I dont mind the family drama but at the same time the gameplay in the ps3 games are far better then what the reboot games have achieve.
Ive played every tomb raider game expect rise and shadow and out of all of those games I like tru reboot and og lara  and to be honest knowing crystal dynamics I definitely dont have high hopes for this.
lara died in the egyptian tomb of set and Im sick of pretending otherwise. those games will always exist and they cant take that away so its really an indifferent situation. chloe fraser s the next tough female explorer to take lara s spot.
keep talking what you think melonie  never change!
ask lara croft if she is lonely.   lara  I see
I still cant believe the cd tomb raider still doesnt use the ironic double pistols
friends  why dont we do a hashtag and raise it and have the hashtag  savelara fromcrystal
no matter what these guys think  laura was a strong female character  my sister looked up to her as I imagine a lot of other little girls did. she was self-sufficient  she need no one else. she was beautiful and strong. she was someone for little girls to look up to. she was someone for obvious reasons boys wanted to play with  but girls wanted to be.
by the way  what you mentioned about Christianity at the end  I think a lot of people have a problem with western Christianity specifically. Christian values are actually pretty good  and though I dont worship a religion myself  horrible feckin trauma  I respect those Christians who are actually decent people and are open-minded  like any rational human being. its the western Christianity folks  the misogynistic transphobic ones  that lot of people seem to have a problem with. I dont delve into religion too much  so I dont know what s going on with all of that  and I dont want to know. as long as everyone stays safe and happy.
if they didn t learn the first time from the remakes maybe they ll learn after the second time when they get poor sales. same thing with star wars. are youreally gonna hire the same group of people that ruined a legend.
let s do the opposite of what the target audience wants... ...and this is why you shouldn t hire people who use twitter xd
new melanie mac video instant click and like
if...if they have multiple lovers and you can choose  like mass effect  I d be down for that. just make it a romance side story.
- how can we make lara croft interesting again - let her have personal problems.- introduce bazillion new characters.- make lara gay.- make her an independent badass adventurer who seeks ancient artifacts for thrills   angry face    guy gets thrown out of window
why are big corporations so out of touch with their customers  about 7 years behind the times   get woke go broke  has been the one consistent theme forever-and-a-day and they still think we want more wokeness what s wrong with these people
lara has always been a strong smart independent woman. what needs changing im lost
there people are so obsessed with who people are sleeping with  its disgusting!
or who they sleep with  who cares
I think youre confused  the reboot was a ps3 game  and there weren t any other mainline tomb raider games for ps3.
so  maybe lara croft as a shemale  if they are going to with a much of absurdes... lara croft is a heterosexual  vaginal  she is an adventurer and in the first classic part she even wasn t a killer. there is about a space  an architecture  a mysterious things  an ancient technology and a lots of passion. there is lara  as the tittled tomb raider. there is her point of view  her characteristic style  her good heart deep inside  her love for the adventure  her unique connection with archeology. its really much  why to waste the potential  to change it for a soap opera
where do I sign to not let this happen to our beloved lady croft
Im just thankful lara was not born larry.  it could explain why lara likes girls.
I feel like her having a romantic interest wouldn t be bad if they had the same goals and had the same trauma but it being a female its just not it
and also why aren t females allowed to be strong anymore unless they re gay  its really disheartening as a straight woman that I cant see myself in any of these female characters xd its like they think being straight or single makes you weak.
can we just get someone to create a new game with a character like original lara
cant wait for the legacy of kain game where azrael has daddy issues and needs to talk to a demon about it. hope embracer calls ya.
I completely agree with you melonie I love the tomb raider series but if these leaks are true I hope this game flops.
sadly  it has come to the point with aaa games where you cant trust anything they say about an upcoming release. its good to be hopeful  but its prudent to be skeptical until the game releases when everything will be revealed.
will she say  that belongs in a museum!
Im looking forward to hearing your take on the woke coming for Christianity. from what I understand its already in some black churches.
hey melonie I just want to say that I do wish that the company who is making the new tomb raider video game would make laura croft look like the original 1996 laura croft by her outfit and her hairstyle by the way she should look like back in the 1996 tomb raider era  ok melonie. also everyone including me and you would like it and love it to play the new tomb raider video game. anyway thats what I wanted to say bout this topic of the video of the new tomb raider video game  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have had a great day today at gym and at home and I do hope you continuing to have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
if only you were the game director for the next tomb raider  it would be so good!
where is toby gard  now this is getting out of hand with what they re doing to lara.   bringbackclassiclaracroft
lara croft is clearly independent  I agree  but she was far from asexual. she was certainly in touch with her own sexuality  whether she was serious or not. consider thatshe openly flirts with larson  von croy  jean yves  and even the player. she appears flirtatious in a lot of the promotional images for the core era games  too. I dont think she had any serious designs in these directions  but the older core games clearly showed us thatshe could encompass such thoughts within her intelligence. now could lara croft be a little lonely  maybe she could be  but I would certainly not make that a focal point of her characterization  or have her express that directly. aod did a great job of showing us that lara was attracted to kurtis using only her body language. but even so  if there was any chance that this connection would have gone anywhere  it would have been because she wanted it to  not because she needed it.
nothing says  grounded tone  like creating a self-insert character that represents less than 5  of the population.
Jesus they just keep ruining lara more and more Im so sick of this crap usually Im to shy to comment but man it pisses me off what they are trying to do and giving her a relationship is a terrible idea I agree with you on her being unattainable. and the stupid shit with working with a team of tomb raiders is even worse.....ugghh. lets hope they scrap this but if it does come out and all of this stuff is true I will not be playing it at all.
if they give lara a girlfriend she will be a lesbian character until the end of time. that is not the kind of thing that they would ever go back on. and I highly doubt that the backlash to these leaks is going to make them change anything  since they had to know that these creative decisions  especially giving lara a girlfriend  would have generated this response. the best we can hope for is that these were early story ideas  and that the creative team already reversed course on their own.
yikes! tomb raider future looking bleek now.
bingo. thats what they want you to think and feel like
Im gonna buy it just to see her kiss a woman. hope she s not ugly tho
never preorder and do plenty of research and watch tons of reviews. I wait for sales anyways. I just now picked up forbidden west for  40 after a big patch as well  seeing that there were technical issues at launch. all the info and walkthroughs are out by now too
I like the new trilogy and enjoy playing it a lot. of course I also know the old tomb raider games  but I like the new lara more. like dr. alan grant once said in jurassic park   the world is changing so fast  we have to run to catch up . we cant always live in the past  we have to try something new. you cant tell beforehand itsucks  if you haven t tried it. if you still dont like it afterwards  thats okay too  but you cant always dig up old stuff from the past. it wouldn t get to the first parts anyway  so why all the fuss
big question  is a scene or an action need to tell the store and help the game play. leave it on the edit floor if it is not needed. any target to being pc is aim toward money  how much can we make by adding pc into the story to gain more revenue.
I saw a bow instead of dual pistols in the thumbnail and I already got pissed lol
lara could have walked away from the dragon  but she knew she had to put him down. same with set. jolie had lara on lock.
I want old lara back so much its unreal she was such an inspiration and its heart breaking they turning this franchise into woke genderbend uncharted
that image art scared me at first until you said it was for rise lol if we have another game with a bow and arrow...and if they do go with this concept and it comes to fruition  let s all band together and not buy it. hit them in their wallets. maybe the new publisher will get a new team to work on things.and as a gaymer here  making her in any sort of relationship is stupid af. she s a strong independent woman who doesnt need a man woman.
I dont think  protecting artifacts  is too out of character for lara  Imean she wasn t like indiana jones  that belongs in a museum!  but didn t she have a whole room full of artifacts at her mansion  she collected them and obviously cared enough about them to put them in display cases. I guess to her they were more like trophies  but she was still protecting them. for herself lol.
I was scared as soon as I saw the title for this.
she s literally the tomb raider. she shouldn t be the one protecting anything lmao
lara is not gay she s independent and hardworking and adventures
honestly Im excited to see a more mature and full formed lara plus I hope alex her friend from the first adventure back of 2013 will join her with some of the nostalgic characters from the first games I dont want joenh to join because he is extremely annoying and I hope we get some of the og designs for lara in a more modern way and I hope its not going to be a fake woke game and I hope it focuses more on the adventure instead of the shadow of the tomb raider nonsense I loved rise and the first name of the report I want something that includes an island again and adventure around a particular areas exploring more tombs laura and her own element of discovering history
this just in. a major part of the single player campaign of the next version of grand theft auto series will focus the player on feeding the homeless.
alright  its time to make my own tomb raider
why is lara croft trying to be carmen sandiego now  xd like protecting artefacts from thieves and then returning them to their rightful museums with a team of minions. crystal dynamics probably binged the series and was like--  thats our next lara project
lara croft go was surprisingly fun. hate the rumoured changes about lara
just make her like the classic lau lara again
if crystal dynamics is getting insperation from naughty dog thats not bad to be honest half the games theyve pushed out these past few years have been pretty good with story and charecters and other shit
why do they have to destroy everything. its not hard just listen to the fans bring lara back to her classic self  classic look  classic character!  modernising  doesnt mean good or better.
Ive noticed that your videos do not get recommend at all my homepage dashboard  whatever its called  which doesnt make sense at all considering Ive watched a lot of your videos and liked them as well. the obvious conclusion to make is that youtube is specifically flagged your channel not to be recommended. even this video has 14k views with 500  comments  very high interaction  which should make the recommendation algorithm to alert me that there is a new video for me to watch. but no you ve not shown up once in the many times Ive refreshed my page and gone deep down the list. Im sorry that youtube doesnt like free-thinkers
I am absolutely against lara having some romantic relationship and against her relying on some peeps. give us the old lara!
honestly  if the old lara comes back  I wont buy it. if I want to see the old lara  I can also play the old tomb raider games.
yes she had a trophy room. she stole artifacts for her own thrill  had nothing to do with protecting anything.
@melonie mac go boom  but there is a distinction between what lara does and what a grave robber does. usually a grave robber steals artifacts in hopes of selling them off for money. lara doesnt care about money  she steals them to keep them. so in a weird way she is  protecting them  from getting pawned off to the highest bidder at some black market.
@madiq ismal  she s still stealing them for herself. she s not a indian jones.
@fiction theorizer  Im not arguing thatshe isn t stealing them  she is a tomb raider after all. Im just saying she is protecting artifacts since she keeps them secured in her mansion. she doesnt sell them or destroy them. even if she keeps them as trophies  a trophy is something that is cherished and protected.
@madiq ismal  true but thats just about any collector worth their salt. its not altruism  its practicality.
the thing is that lara steals artifacts from all over the world for fun   its her passion  she said in the beginning of the very first game that   she only plays for sport . of course you can see her as putting artifacts in her home as a form of  protection   but it feels more like   possession   they are her trophies  she s having fun collecting them   she was overall a good person who never wish to hurt innocent people   but she isn t exactly a hero either   she has her own agency   she s more of an anti-hero .
alex died...
do youremember wet  it wasn t tr but it was still kick-butt.
@dying rose  that name sounds very famillar
@pablo pesquera  wet took some queues from max payne  but its with a female. it was back before wokeness exploded. check it out.
the irony is that isn t even carmen sandiego. thats indian jones. remakes ruin everything.
such a bummer
hot news! tomb raider s movie rights are up for grabs. which studio will grab it  who will be a new lara croft!
the next installment should be called tomb flipper.
changing the character to fit the message  Im shocked. shocked  I tell ya. well  not thatshocked.
crystal just let lara dual wield and get out of her way.
great! victim lara  just what we always wanted.
this is why I pray hollywood never touches doom again
just wanted to give people hope  and a reminder all this woke crap is at an end. we are seeing a trend now with the cancelation of batgirl  the many woke netflix shows that got the ax  and things like new antiwoke companies like the ripperverse emerging. we may get a few more shitty ruined franchises over the years  but understand the pendulum is swinging the opposite direction now.
sounds like they are just trying to reboot the reboot to be like the reboot.
Im learning to enjoy simple things in life  with all the free time I have by avoiding all the woke garbage that is being put out now.  the funny thing is  I dont feel like Im denying myself anything.  you know...like when you give up ice cream because you are on a diet   this doesnt feel like that.  it feels like simply side stepping the dog poop some jerk left on the sidewalk when they walked their dog.   my life feels richer with the more engaging things Im doing  like camping  hiking  wood working  reading non-woke novels  etc...
hey guys and gals...  does anybody here remember when a new game or movie off a popular franchise was cause for joy instead of sorrow yeah... I dont either. ..
couldn t agree more. great video. this woke madness needs to stop.
I could never picture lara as straight so I dont mind her being queer. in fact I love it  but I understand why many fans dont want to see her in any relationship
protecting artifacts     I predicted this while playing one of the shadow of the tomb raider dlc tombs.I titled my play through video  tomb replacer  instead of tomb raider  and had a rant in the video  that they had better not go this goodie two shoes route with future tomb raider games.I think us original tomb raider fans will have to do  what the friday night tights guys have had to do with their favourite franchises  like  dr who  star wars and star trek  and just disown future tomb raider games.
all this outrage will do nothing to hurt embracer because at the end of the day controversy does in fact create cash.
she is the female indiana jones james bond. she doesnt settle down.
pulls up list of games  removes this  and perfect darksaving money sure is nice. hope it was worth it cd  because Im sure Im not alone.
melonie got some fine tattoos!!!
yeah Im gonna skip the next game. good luck embracer group!
the thing is  with ellie from tlou it made sense she s lesbian  because they didn t explore her sexuality and personality at its fullest yet  so she could have been anything  she was a blank page.with lara it does not make sense  she s not about having people in her life  she s about the thrill and andventure  and kurtis has always been the closest thing to being interested in another human being  and even then  it was not romantic. I hate how they try to make her different from what she s always been.just create a fucking new ip and let original lara rest instead of butchering her character.as a gay man it also makes me mad  because they re not making her bI lesbian for lgbt representation  also  looks like an athletic woman in love with archeology has to be lesbian  wtf   they re just throwing ideas at a wall and see what sticks. and I hate it.
square enix still owns tomb raider and crystal dynamics cuz they said the deal will be finalized sometime in september and square enix sending out the dmca had the opposite effect and actually drew more attention to the casting script which caused more backlash over it and push square which is a popular playstation news site has said that they dont like this script and basically their whole comment section was also people saying how they hate this script as well and want it to be cut so I feel like because of this backlash that the value of crystal dynamics as a company has fallen and I feel like embracer group might try to negotiate a lower price which square enix doesnt want cuz the  300 million dollars will basically recover the money that crystal dynamics spent on the survivor trilogy and I hope this game bombs if this is the script they are using so that way lara croft can finally be freed from crystal dynamics and get back to her roots.  savelarafromcrystal
I agree with you
why dont we do the hashtag and save lara we all know she s not suitable for this shit
if we cant have og lara  can we have at least underworld lara  I played the first game of reboot  and lost all interest. got the full reboot trilogy for free from the epic bothered  still didn t bothered trying.
oh no... not that bow again  where are our beloved dual pistols    edith  oh my God what are they doing with lara croft  lara is supposed to be a antihero! she is a rich badass asshole who safes the world alone and nothing stands in her way! if cristal dynamics cant make this  they should give lara back to core design edith2  saying your own opinion is what the real lara croft would do and honestly if they get their feelings hurt just because you criticise the work they shouldn t work in this kind of section....
the tomb raider ip needs to go to a new development studio.
not super hero s but a team of archeologist that pull around heavy equipment but also go on reuters and things go rung anf thatsort of stuff. charactures with different abilities climing crawling stranded speed
the game is about lara croft because it about lara croft.
yeah  I dont think we re ever getting an actual tomb raider game again. which is a shame  because I loved the lara croft character all the way through tomb raider  underworld. then they rebooted and... ugh. the 2013 release was fine  it felt like a snuff film at times and the endless pained moans of lara croft were off-putting  but it worked. it was the origin story no one needed and no one wanted  in which lara croft owes everything to men and  indeed  gains her killer instinct and will to survive from a man attempting to rape her. progressive!rise of the tomb raider leaned way too heavily into electra-complex madness  this prophet reminds me of my dad... ooo  Im so attracted to him  and had awful  awful writing... but the gameplay was solid. just mute the tv every time fake-lara talks and its bearable.shadow of the tomb raider was a game I couldn t even bring myself to beat. between the walking simulator indigenous town  the awful writing  the horrible plot  the stilted dialogue  the woke politics  and lara s sheer idiocy  I checked out. I think I stopped right around the point where lara washes up on a riverbank  where she easily grapples and kills an armed man twice her size  girls get it done y all!  before pouting that all her weapons are gone and she ll have to sneak to survive... while the dead guy s ak-47  pistol  and grenades were glowing on the ground. every enemy I killed after that literally dropped multiple weapons from their bodies upon death too... but no  the gormless worm wouldn t pick up a single one of them. the game developers wanted a stealth murder sequence  even if they had to temporarily disable the pick-up feature and make lara look like a bell-end. burned me out.so tomb raider 2023 being a dumpster fire in the making is no surprise to me at all. I bet they ll make her a nonbinary genderqueer lesbian for maximum woke points  too. just lather it on.
I honestly dont mind the girl on girl action  just depends on how its executed.I also loved the rebooted series  but Ive only finished anniversary and underworld from the older games.so I guess the fact that they are humanizing her is what I like  I generally dont like merry sue characters.Im game for anything just no politicks and wokeness please.
sounds more like indiana jones then lara croft.
for almost 30 years tomb raider has been a proven formula for success no idea why out of nowhere it has to be changed
laura croft was a badass treasure hunter and thrill seeking adventurer not some protect artifacts and soft spoken lonely heroine. she s suppose to be some what of a femme fatale type.
imagine the drama if the next game has lara using her  iconic  bow and arrows  while her girlfriend uses dual pistols.suppose if the above happens they could kill off the girlfriend and have lara use her dual pistols as a way of feeling like she is protected by her whenever lara uses them.
yessss finally... tomb raider has become womb raider!!!!!!
yo the needed to keep lara without any love interest like samus in metroid  you are not playing tomb raider for relationship drama  you are playing to find lost civilizations  fighting dinosaurs  dragons  and yetis
ideologically possessed agenda s never make good stories. I am just about as conflicted about this news as laura s new sexuality. I know your a huge fan.
her ex boyfriend in the first movie and top cow comics we re essentially the same guy.
mel  you cant turn gta into a game about feeding the homeless!!!well  rockstar anounced that for gta 6 they will remove all offensive jokes to be more inclusive.  gta not offensive
they could do so much with this game just make a super edgy lara croft that kills bad guys and shoots dinosaurs and make itsuper gory lol literally would be game of the year
yeah thatsounds horrible. if this is what they think we want then I am done with tomb raider. I am so tired of watching everything go to shit and companies thinking people want woke trash movies and games and they ruin amazing things like tomb raider and lara.
I understand your view about her being suddenly lgbtq isnt authentic. I agree I would much rather have her not being with anyone in case she could now be fetishized as many wlw women are. I like to fannon her as on the ace spectrum as she isnt really interested in being with anyone romantically or sexually
dear God no. no more fricken drama. she supposed to do what she wants. this just sounds like they said  cool we r done family drama  we did friend drama  if I hear her scream jonah again....im throwing the controller   soooooo shit lets do relationship drama!  except they have done relationship drama. in both angelina movies and angel of darkness. this series is gonna tank if they dont pull their heads out of their ass....
tomb raider has been changed since 2006  then again in 2013. tomb raider hasn t been itself since the year 2000 honestly

we need the old lara croft with her duo pistols!
colin is odd one  he can be and extremely short sided playstation fanboy  but he does has a real gaming journalist background. which he sometimes allows to shine through  so yes I take him serious on this one. honestly I  im sure im not the only one  never had the illussion we would get authentic lara. if this is going to be it  I hope it flops underperforms just like third wave motivated reboots did. they trying to do the same thing has what dc has done to harley quinn  who is a cool character but she isnt some one who can be redeemed to be a hero. they will never do this kind of female characters justice  cause they represent everything they hate  and this goes especially for lara croft  jill valentine  she-ra  storm   tifa.as long most double a   tripple a studios are occupied and managed by activist only huge financial damage can make them ago away. the best hope is that a new studio existing out industry vets who have been forced bullied out of the industry come together and make their own version.
square enix behind this  im surprised...
Im all for lara being more experienced and junk but I dont know why they should reboot it lol just make a fourth to what we already have and just have lara show all she has learned through her journey already have her be more confident have that game be the end of thatstory then reboot it.and what s this about her being lonely she never cared about companionship even though she has had them.
im going to guess  lara begins her search for the mythical tomb of the first trans guy  in greece or somewhere
cd needs to take a hike from tr franchise
why cant they continue the storyline like traod  tru  tra or trl  that was the tomb raider I was in love with to play
I always saw laura hooking up with a girl cause she was hot back then lol but I dont really want agendas involved. honestly like her flirty but no relationships just being a badass is all I want.
cant wait for them to give doom slayer a love interest in the next doom game because he s lonely. it ain t even about them making her gay I wouldn t want this if it were a dude love interest either. they didn t do it with jonah at all in the last games why do they have to do it now. lol
why are they giving her a girlfriend she ain t gay  it like if they reboot nathan drake and give him a boyfriend
where s a good place to pick up one of those cactus diorama s with the layered sand
here is a thought  if they didn t produce crap  you wouldn t tell them to flush it down the toilet.if their feelings got hurt over you telling them the truth  it means they know they are wrong.
thanks  I will save my money I dont like where the franchise is going
I dont know if this connection is at all relevant  but Ive noticed this strange tendency for lgbt fanbases to project themselves onto whichever misfit characters they happen to like  until they are somehow convinced that these characters have to be somewhere on the lgbt spectrum themselves. consider frozen  the petition to give elsa a girlfriend in the sequel   vasquez from  aliens   whom many lgbt fans assumed was gay  despite the movie implying she and drake were an item   velma from scooby dooo  who is apparently written this way in the newer series  I suppose because every bookish and less traditionally feminine lady must be gay   and any heterosexual-only romance option from the dragon age series.
how old is lara in the game
soooo cd s reasoning to help with tr reboot s poor sales is to piss off the fans .......sounds about right.
I preferred rise of the tomb raider as far as the reboot series goes. it just felt like they hit the sweet spot in terms of what they were going for. the reboot felt like it wasnt tomb raider  and shadow just feels bloated.
hey mel!! melvin here! just wanted to let you know that youtube unsubscribed me from your channel. you must be speaking truth that the algorithm doesnt respect. keep up the good work my lady  Im resubscribing lol!
Imean I dont consider these tomb raider games bad  the problem is that it is so out of character is though to see them as lara croft games
its gonna be tomb raider two girls one artifact
they have to push homosexuality at all times. esg scores and all that jazz.
last tomb raider game featuring lara croft was  underworld .there were some copycat games starring a sobbing mass murderer girl - apparently a minor according to her body.
Im actually a progressive myself and I find what the entertainment industry is doing with the characters that are already established to be disingenuous and ridiculous. I would even go as far as to say that they dont believe in the causes that they claim to be fighting for.
great! we gonna have to save sam again
they try to please these people but they dont buy the games. the ones that moan about lack of representation are the ones that dont buy the product.lara croft needs to go back to her roots and basically remake the first game but with obviously new twist. use the first game as a base to start a new chapter in her life. use an open world style system to flesh out the world so we see her travelling to locations and maybe meeting villains and more during these moments. we cant have her character changed to be gay or teaming up with other tomb raiders as that isn t her. she might use other tomb raiders as a means to an end. but she wouldn t team up with anyone.
if we do not find out more abwt lara then what is the pont
you can dislike it all you want.. you can never say  this is what she was created to be   fictions can be reinterpreted. there s a thing called  poetic licence  hello!also  someone who s goal is pure adventure is boooring and done a Godzillian times! the trilogy were fun.p.s her characteristics is still selfish ambition. especially in shadow of tomb raider  its all about her saving the world  even neglecting the people in need of help. jonah was even angry at her for that.
I could understand lara croft fighting dinosaurs  mummies  abominable snowmen  etc...but for f -sakes I cant stand the aliens.fighting alien species is cringe for me. I like grounded in the sense it comes from earth  but anything extra-terrestrial is cringe.and I agree that giving lara croft a love interest   working with a team is a terrible idea and goes against everything she stood for. she s a thrill seeker  not a goody two shoes.
lara having a girlfriend  wtf
Im not against lara being in a relationship. but I hope its not just gonna be tacked on or just a moment where the company is like look what we did. Im not against the new version of her being more human. games cant thrive on minimal cutscenes and story like the old days. and like it or not  the survivor trilogy sold more units than any of the other games before combined. fans aren t owed anything by developers. but I do wish they d stop calling her an archaeologist. she s not. but itsounds like they re just trying to be more respectful of other cultures pasts and wealth. why is that woke trash
6 50 the tallest women are in the netherlands and you fit in perfectly.
from an intelligent marketing aspect... why... why would anyone mess with the very characteristics and formula that made a simple indy title from 1996 into a billion dollar world wide phenomenon   its like a license to print money if you stick with the evidence of what works.
after the woke pathetic excuse shadow turned out to be  I wouldn t be surprised if this is the next installment of stupidity planned for the demise of a beloved iconic female icon!
I want you to be my next tomb raider game.
know this video is a few months old but as someone that played every tomb raider game and loved wattching a strong hot athletic boxom woman going through crap to get what she was after with a  the hell with the consequence attitude  was the character I got every new game for.... until I saw and played as a librarian  in every sense of the word  portraid as lara  I was beyond p  ed off.  who was this little cry baby  I was shocked  what happened to my girl   she has been desecrated beyond recognition.
lara will get an lesbian makeover and the internet will go hopping mad about it
this is a problem with lara croft becoming such a big icon.the fact she s so popular with empowerment that modern day has to shove her into any woke movement as if gamers care about being represented when all they want is a game.we want digital entertainment not being lectured on acceptance and social justice and commentary.
Im not a tomb raider fan since I never grew up on the series  but its sad to see another classic series get torn to shreds and put back together into something its not  like some horrific paper-mache. I hope you fans get the games you want and not whatever this crap is.
so they want to go woke route with lara. please God no. I dont want grounded either. give me spectacle. I want lara to find dinosaurs that have survived millions of years from extinction guarding a tomb and her to load her guns saying  shame.
perhaps the cure would be to create a new franchise that hard copies the classic tomb raider. it could be called adventures of laura cruz. just a bad-ass lady with a braid  shorts  dual pistols  a backpack. the game would include sensational things like fighting t-rex  yettI  kayaking  quad biking  traveling through exotic locations. the game could overshadow their tomb raider iteration  causing poor sales and losing the franchise. I think the original wonderful concept will never come back with crystal dynamics. and its nonsense to make a unified lara  it can never work. lara croft will now be a lesbian. its literally gone crazy at crystal dynamics. the legendary lara croft! oh God  they re probably at a creative rock bottom after marvel s avengers. I have no words for it. they used the famous name of tomb raider to create something completely different. tomb raider   tomb raider  not tomb protector or tomb guardians! I d really like to play the classic tomb raider style of gameplay like nicobass showed in his demo project.
hey melonie  have you heard of this game called among walls its like tomb raider.
@daniel alarcon  nope not at all. some of my best friends are lgbt its forcing it down throats thats the issue.if youre gay. cool whatever.but just tacking it on for sales is awful
why make lara a hero  when you can just be a villain  its so much more fun. also  as someone who is lgbtq   I dont want lara to have a girlfriend  or a boyfriend  or any romantic interest. she was always her own character  and never needed other people. I wouldn t mind if she flirted with girls or something  but giving her a relationship is just going to play on  lara needs people because she s lonely and sad and cant do anything on her own.  they are simply using their rights over tomb raider to make their own game and I feel they should give it to a company that actually cares about tomb raider s history. also  thank you melonie mac for always sharing your opinions and being true to what you believe in.
right  the reboot - the first one was alright  second one was meh  third one was kind of okay. lara being bisexual - I would have been fine if that was in the original. it would have fit her personality to use people for sex but not get attached. conversely  the whole obsession with sam in the reboot  I believe they intended to make them a couple   then with jonah was a bit too much. her being so dramatic  shifting the tone from her family dynamics to a sob story  making the whole franchise a shooter game and ditching the puzzles  thats what completely ruined it for me. now her needing help from other tomb raiders  seriously  I really hope this is the lara from the other side of the portal in underworld  otherwise I dont see a way they can justify how they ruined the character I grew up with and loved.
you hit the nail on the head about lara. ...this woke shit is so bad ....  thx     peace
embrace a group stock is not that expensive. but it is otc stock  so it is difficult to acquire. the company itself is worth only about four or 5 hundred million dollars  and although elon backed out  he did show us how we can solve these problems. Ive got my own projects going  along those lines  but Im sure there s other people out there who are just as frustrated with this nonsense as we are. and there is one solution  and only one solution for it. we can keep quiet  we can keep complaining  or we can use the free market to get the stuff out of the hands of activists. the choice is really ours. my question is how many of us actually believe what we say we believe  and how many of us are actually willing to put our money where our mouth is
okay I am done.  walking down stairs  closing door and stepping on gass
if she s  protecting artefacts  she s no longer a tomb raider. ridiculous.
as far as I know there wouldn t even be any new or decent tomb raider games without crystal dynamics. the series was practically dead after the terrible angel of darkness back in the day. thatsaid I do agree with what youre saying about lara croft as a character  we dont need another woke sh t show like the last of us 2.
jawbreakers ! ya boi!
if this is true   it is time to boycot tomb raider. cd should not be allowed to touch tr. I am however not disappointed because I am already accustomed to what cd does to tr.
lara croft is a noble girl not a cheap average girl!.
it would ve been badass if lara was always portrayed as a lesbian  but its so annoying that they keep trying to give her love interests randomly in the franchise. I always hated when they gave her a love story in aod or the col film. just let her be the lone adventuring anti-hero she was originally. but with thatsaid  representation is important and things will always change over time. we may never get to see classic lara again but I hope we at least get remakes remasters of the classics.
Ive got no problems with rug munchers being in games or whatt have you but these things  let s call it what it is  corporate box ticking  always come at the expense of good story telling and character development. long gone are the days of san andreas when you could tell a story about characters that just happened to be part of a certain group other than straight white men with fantastic hair. now  it always becomes about how can we crow bar  insert group  into this and think that will be enough.the problem is as well is that lara is becoming the british nathan drake  someone who fumbles and flukes her way through situations. lara to me was like a female cpt. price. she was always bordering on the sociopathic  just bouncing around the globe killing men and endangered animals alike. she doesnt strike me as a character that needs anyone  make or female and instead is more focused on her adventures. like a business woman focusing on her career. I understand times change and characters develop but these things are usually put into video games as to give them an excuse of its bad  so they can just accuse people of being homophobic  racist  trsnsphobic ect. when people criticise the writing  case in point last of us 2
laura croft is an adrenaline junkie. as for her returning a sacred relic to somewhere in india  indiana jones did that in the temple of doom
thanks for keeping it real. as a lesbian  I dont need to see lara with anyone  man or woman. if they wanted to force a relationship with a woman  they could ve made it more believable with sam  like  lol she s perfectly capable of being alone and happy  and I dont understand why thats such a hard concept to accept  why does her happiness hinge on a fucking relationship    Jesus. if its all real  its bs. she s not a hero  she doesnt need to be  relatable   and Im honestly tired of the assassination to her character. anyway  great vid. I enjoyed hearing your thoughts on it.
I was there when the first tomb raider first came out she has always tried to protect artifacts this is the hole being of lara looks like they are going back to the old tomb raider if this is true Im all for it  I like the new lara  but I loved the old lara croft more so if they are going back to her roots then all I can say is hell yeah! but in this day and age I doubt it I bet the next lara croft will be masive woke trash
Ive always viewed lara as asexual aromantic honestly. I dont really see the need to include any kind of romance. that isn t really what tomb raider is about.
the product is for the fans... not for self projection and catering to niche audiences. this was well known and established up until roughly 5 years ago  margin of error in the year Im sure as to when things got the way they re going now. the changed formula has been proven to be wrong time-and-time again. take it from us millennials... go back to the old formula that worked all through the 90 s and most of the 2000 s  and things will be a lot better. here s a simple sweet test... compare the 90 s to now... which is better  youre welcome.I truly feel bad for those who never got to experience the 90 s. I guess Im projecting my nostalgia for the 90 s at this point. oh well... the 90 s were truly better times compared to now period.
like I love your hair and stuff!
I dont understand people insistence on making a fictional characters love life be part of a game where it is superfluous. who cares who she is dating or screwing  its an action game not a dating simulator. the game is called tomb raider  not womb raider  focus on her raiding tombs and uncovering mystical artifacts to save the world.
will I live in an era that lara croft and tomb raider is dead as a franchise simply because the people handling it dont know what it is and what keeps it enthralling to its fans
I never saw lara as a villain though. she was more like a sigma female. rogue  against authority  played by her own rules.
@dying rose  yeah  ig not fully a villain  but more like an anti-hero
@mrbust    just dont see her as the character to have any love interest at all
I will concede he being 5 6 though makes a lot more sense both from the fact camilla was shirt and thus so was lara and its unlikely she s had a growth spurt after 22 and also its mocapped now unlike the ps1 2 eras. so youre going to have a real woman next to real men and most women are 5 6 or under and most men are 5 8 or 9 in the uk and thats just biology so I dont think that can really be helped
exactly  if anything lara is an anti-hero   she was more in line with cat woman from batman   she steals artifacts for sports but she never hurt innocent people   she has her own agency   she s never trying to   protect  or  save  the world   ididnt mind the reboot series   but this one is too far for me . I want my lone wolf   tomb-raiding   unapologetically badass lara back !
@orange chicken  exactly! all of this  I agree wholeheartedly. the reboot is fine for what it is and what it aimed to accomplish  but I want the old lara back. all the things that made the older games so great  what made all of us fall in love with them in the first place  and the reason why we re all still here. there was something about them  y know  something about her that resonated with all of us  and itsucks to see her story continuously being altered to fit whatever narrative is in right now. I cannot stand strong female  characters suffering  loneliness  and needing  support  to make them capable. she was fine on her own  she enjoyed being alone  and everything she did was for sport and the thrill it gave her. hopefully some changes will be made since most of the fandom doesnt agree  but I wouldn t be surprised if it doesnt change anything at all.
yes this
womb raider
being an action game only is boring tomb raider 2013 was just action  and was boring so whats ur point!.
@xgaming4k  who said the new tomb raider is a love sim  they said she might be a lesbian in her affection towards an npc. if you feel this is annoying press skip for the cutsccene. in tomb raider 2013 she had an affection towards sam!. but the game main story was focused on yamatai!.
@xgaming4k  you cant judge a book by its cover!. lara always protected artifacts like when she tried to prevent trinity from putting their hand on the divine source for instance. and getting thors hammer to face natla and preventing her from owning it.
I wanna have one more thought. an artist who cannot take friendly criticism  especially from somebody like you who intended to be helpful and constructive  is an artist incapable of growth  and as such are not artists.
the level of writing across all of our entertainment has gotten so ridiculously bad that  had I not seen it  I never would ve thought it possible. I wont be buying this game.
ls is a great patreon to sub too he fuckn amazing he got better ever since he left kinda funny
until woke politics die  you will never get quality entertainment from the west again. ive said it many times  but square enix was never the problem to begin with. they could have fired the devs and handed tr to japanese devs and fans would have cried foul. they instead left it in the hands of western devs in an attempt to show the franchise the respect it deserved. embracer group will more than likely produce a woke product that will be unsatisfactory. vote with your wallets when they do.
rip tomb raider
thank God for games like monster hunter and elden ring... where we dont have to deal with this  woke  bullshit. we just bash monsters  get loot  level up  and go tf to sleep
as a raging homo  who s entire childhood was lara and tomb raider. nope. I cannnnoottttt  get off lara. she s an icon in her own right  without having these identities thoughtless attached to her. Im all here for representation and it is important to have lgbt characters  but not at the expense of characters that already exist. imagine if this was reversed and you erased an lgbt character making them straight  Im just not here for it  I only play for sport  one of her first ever lines.
here we go again  whats wrong with no relationship bs and just going on an adventure killing mercenaries and animals and finding artifacts
I guess its time for the gaming industry to have its turn in the barrel.  woke locusts are still hard at work killing the mcu but now they re hitting the game industry full on.  first we have gta vI news where rumor has it its being nerfed  now we have them going to work on lara.   very disappointed but not at all surprised.  and adding 1 more thing  Ive stopped watching marvel films because they re pretty much cr p now  if the new lara is some woke zoomer self obsessed weirdo  Im not buying that either.
the irony that feminism has been creating unrealistic  power fantasy  female protagonists meanwhile lara croft is being torn down.
5 40  this is childish. I dont like it. if there s a public for that  it could be a rpg-like  with multiple choices and consequences. 21 31  childish again  if she is your favorite character and all you canthink of her is a superhero.6 22  tabloids media is dangerous of rushing too much the consequences for her acts. its ok  but I would not add that.7 37  its not about identification. I guess a more humane lara is an opportunity for things like justifying the use of other characters working together with her  flexibilizes the story  as she can has a romance or appear in a rich party elegantly  without sounding unbelievable  and things like that. she can be a brute heroic  but I guess this would only lead to less options  which is risky at long term.11 53  hardly justifiable. this is bad for nowadays standards  when we can have rich stories. I guess this could fit more into lara croft series  a more  let s play and not talk  approach.17 44  this is the future of gaming  interactive movies. some movies are bad at all  or at least on ending  because characters make stupid decisions - in books  this is pandemic!
drinking game  every time melonie repeats the same point she already made  take a shot.but seriously  of course they have to put lara in a relationship and of course it has to be with another woman. they need to normalize sexual deviance as much as possible.
why would lara croft struggle with loneliness. she clearly doesnt care about people. she killed like 1000 people in the reboot without caring. sorry 999 people because she got upset over the first one heh
honestly  her being  short  isn t an issue for me. in fact  I think its kinda funny when a short or average sized woman is kicking the ass of foes triple her size. I just want more focus on exploration and nerding out about history and less combat.
they are turning laura croft into indiana jones.  conflation of characters is never good.
Im scared of starting an argument in the tomb raider community but God I love tomb raider but I expected this and am ok with this Imean they said they would unify the timelines and bring all 3 lara s into one which is probably why she still has issues and I like that because in my opinion its nice to relate to a character in some way but people can get sick of it I know  but the love interest with a women could be ok or not ok so if the game labels her as a lesbian it wouldn t make any sense as she did have a male love interest 2 times one in the comics and in angel of darkness and so it would break the unification so much so Im really hoping they just scrap this idea and finally listen to the community and Im pretty sure they cant be that far in the development since its a ue5 game and also one more thing I hate the idea of media allowing tomb raiders to work with lara Imean itsounds like a scooby doo plot and I with they make her a solo tomb raider as she is meant to be strong and not need help nobody mention sam it was never a thing it was just a idea when making the game  they were just best friends in the final release  alex showed more love to lara and it was confirmed in a document and there would be no reason to make that part in the game just for her to be a lesbian so I really hope they dont make another ellie Imean I love her character but if they made lara a lesbian it would and wouldn t make issues in the community once again splitting them up this is all the information I foundthe game is codenamed project jawbreaker.the tone of the narrative is down-to-earth with elements of sci-fi.lara has become a seasoned adventurer with years of experience behind her. she was protecting some artifacts. lara s adventures made their way to the tabloids from the media and shaped a new generation of tomb raiders.lara s family dramas are behind her  but now she struggles with loneliness.lara faces a mysterious cataclysm that is beyond her control. the heroine begins working with a team of tomb raiders.for the role of lara are looking for an authentic performer  british woman from about 30 to 40  in good physical shape and about 1.7 meters tall.
I dont get why with all the fantasy elements that tr series has always had  why dont they just implement a multiverse. our lara is still fine and well doing her thing and survivor lara is in her universe doing her thing for her fans.
going by the 2013 reboot and the only character she cared about was sam  I totally would have accepted them as a couple. then they dumped sam for that jonas dude she met  like 5 minutes ago for her useless back up buddy
that goes against everything that lara was created for well  lc was created 25  years ago. she s a fictional character  not a real person. therefore  her traits are bound to change over the years. all that about her playing for sport and being selfish and fighting dinosaurs... we already explored that  it was fun  but there s only so much you can do out of the same formula. the franchise has changed and it will change again in the future. you guys need to get over it.
hmmm   I bet they ll make lara look like joe rogan in a wig.
from my experience  people these days just cant comprehend thatsome people have no interest in this kind of stuff  I dont get why but for some reason people are expected to have brains located in their pelvis  and lately itseems like its getting into fiction as well.
sorry thats an awful idea. the whole multiverse thing is becoming so over done. its just a way to cater to and keep everyone on their teet when in reality they cant please everyone no matter how hard they try. but if you ask me they need to listen to the ones who actually made it possible for them to be at this point  i.e. the original fans.
@mydnyghtamethyst  Imean sure but I also gotta come to terms with the fact that of the original fans... honestly there s not many of us left and I d argue that from a monetary standpoint we re in the minority so its kinda the only way I see of them not messing up og lara anymore  hell the 2 universes dont even need to interact  its not avengers  just 2 separate time lines universes with 2 different laras
okay cool but we have a problem here. the storyline is not ongoing its always how she became the tomb raider and stuff so how is she able to progress with her character when the story isn t
@mondfee94  the  how she became the tomb raider  theme has only be present in the latest 3 games  and briefly during legend. the leaked story for the next game doesnt seem to me like an origin story again. the issue here is that people are assuming the reboot was going to take the path of lara doing acrobatics with dual pistols whilst fighting a t-rex  but that 90s cheesiness is not going to return.
@astrius   90s cheesiness is better than bland  2010s and  2020s gritty realism.most action movies nowadays are a mess of cgi.gritty realism doesnt always mean better and only works for certain properties
@astrius  sometimes good old 90s and 2000s cheesiness is better than the gritty realism of the 2010s and 2020s.some exceptions being the john wick and sicario franchises
thats a matter of opinion. personally  I liked the new direction. so did billions of gamers  in fact  each of the 3 survivor titles have sold more copies than any other tomb raider before them.
@astrius  what is the point of giving a character like lara croft who is usually a loner a team of tomb raiders students
@naquin green  perhaps she ll become a role model for many people but she ll end up realising thatshe works better alone after a tragic death of one of her proteg s. or perhaps they want to give her a new trait  make her a commander and a leader. you ll have to play the game to find out. you just want the character to be always the same  but thats just not gonna happen after so many installments  or else it would be very boring.
the lgbt community should be upset by this  as cd by doing this is claiming that homosexuality is a choice and not something ingrained in you.
God I wish someone with a brain would take the reigns for tomb raider going forward.vote 1 melonie mac
I dont care what lara s orientation is   with the way she s carried herself in the classic games I can see her being attracted to both men and women but in a flirty get information out of you kind a way. not in a romantic lifelong partner way. lara can be bI  just dont make it her whole identity.
so what s wrong with a character being respectful of a culture  lara was never a grave robber. the artifacts she collects are to keep them out of the hands of villains. somewhere itsays she even donates many of her finds to museums. obviously not real but  it makes her more human. she is also a freelance photojournalist on the side. and as far as returning artifacts goes. many countries in the real world are trying to get their artifacts back. its a part of their identity. the british museum has many such stolen artifacts from egypt that they refuse to give back. an unjust decision. so is it wrong for a fictional person to show respect to a country that would appreciates such actions by returning what is rightfully theirs  lara has been returning much of what she finds all along. giving back what is stolen is not woke  it right. that lack of respect in so many people now is one of the things thats fucked up about the world today. Im 36 and grew up with lara too. I dont agree with all the changes either  but this 1 particular change is good.
I remember playing tomb raider when I was in sixth grade  around 11 I think  and in my friend circle  only 2 other people had copy of the game and it was girls. they loved it  they wanted to be a badass like tomb raider. so it is not just about male fantasy because lara is hot  its about a power fantasy. men want lara and women wants to be like lara. she doesnt need love in her story. she need to do badass stuff   a la danta   in devil may cry  raid tombs  find treasures and make a fortune  or be cursed  I dont want a team of tomb raiders  I dont want love interest for her  anyway kurtis and his magic power was super stupid.
so you basically want a plane character  got it.edit  I get that you want her to be more like the original games  but the reboot isn t about this fantacy  is about a more human character  that to this point  with all the games that have come out  wouldn t make sense to make her emotionless. Im a gay man  and I also agree that I d preffer lara to not have any love-relationship.
I hope crystal dynamics continues in the direction they are going and dont suddenly go back to the one dimensional generic and written by a 2 yr old version of lara because of some stuck in the past fans.
obsessed she s 5 6 we be twinning   ! short british queens forever x
because of course she cant be a power fantasy never mind character development. have you watched any movie before
hell nah lara doesnt need companionship
I think it is reasonable for the game studio try to give her personality some depth. with the familie drama gone. I think loneliness is closely related to her being alone lost her parents as we all know.
hi! gay opinion here 1. I agree with most of your points! I too think tomb raider needs to embrace its roots. we love her because she s larger than life!2. while youre right about lara s previous romances not working out. Im open to her being bisexual. plenty of power fantasy characters are bisexual lesbian queer or heavily give the vibes  hanna  fear effect   bayonetta   jean  poison ivy  harley quinn  catwoman  black cat  black cat  mystique  storm   yukio  valkyrie  xena  sailor neptune  sailor uranus  etc... so it could potentially work if written   directed well.3. at this point  I just want a legit tomb raider experience  bI or not  to have my faith in the series restored. even if its a remaster. and then they cantake risks. because I feel like they haven t grasped an understanding of what works for the tr brand.4. for the record  if its  woke  and ends up being another crap game. know that we dont claim it.  woke  things we claim and can be proud of  zagreus  hades   black panther  storm  uhura  harlivy  encanto  saga  pose  blade  zendaya as mj  miles morales  poison  final fight   sf   tracer  solider 76  ellie  tiny tina  willow   tara  everyone from apex legends  x-men  the amazons of themyscira  aqualad  the list goes on and on. we have out hits  just like the anti-woke base has its misses. us on the woke side of things  dont claim whiny lara. the same way the latest star wars trilogy didn t do right by us either. 5. giving you a  thumbs up  on the video. cuz what youre saying is mostly constructive criticism and not malicious and frankly I think the devs should be more open to listening to the og fanbase. because if they mess up a bI relationship with lara  its just going to look bad on us who enjoy lgbt characters in video games. and people will write us off as  woke trash  and use it as ammunition against us. which sucks because there are a lot of amazing lgbt games  shows  characters  movies out there that are woke.
its what to be expected at this point.. these new devs are seriously lame.  its probably because the state of our institutions.. unI college
even the highest numbers estimate lgbt percentages at under 10  of the general population. if identity and relating to the characters is so important  why are they shunning up to 90  of their target audience  why does every single character have to be lgbt  Im so tired of the pandering. Im just done with it all. Im voting with my wallet.
its the current thing now lol
everyone tryin to make lara an lgbtqna icon and give her a girlfriend  lara was already an lgbtqna icon  classic lara was ace aro  thats why she didn t have anyone adventure with her  she didn t need anyone to adventure with her
I dont know what youre talking about with a  power fantasy . the last 3 tomb raider games have been absolute masterpieces of games. let s not stray too far away from their essence. I love her voice and her look. in the picture you show she looks like she has a huge jaw and just looks completely different she looks too manly. there s absolutely no need for that. please no sjw or woke stuff. I dont want to wait 10 years for the developer team to learn that woke goes broke and destroys what it touches. just stop it and be reasonable humans just for now until woke ideology dies a hardcore well deserved death.
bloody hell. they making lara an absolute prat. fans are not going to enjoy this. heck  even the last tomb raider feels kinda boring.
if they give her any love interest! I only wanna see three candidates! kurt  amanda or sam!
you are my laura craft melonie
@knox2don  in every story  the main character needs to develop  whether they learn new things  undergo relationships with other characters  or are tasked to overcome a great deal of conflict. being the  power fantasy  where s she invincible and perfect and doesnt talk to anybody or learn anything is not a good recipe for a story.
for how long does a character needs to develop by the end of sottr and at the start of the next game she should be at the top of her game  the power fantasy.and being a power fantasy doesnt mean having no flaws  even classic and legend laras had their flaws.
@charming peasant  for as long as the story itself exists.
@knox2don  they think any drama is development. as if all stories needed drama  or all games need stories.no has ever debated the emotions a ace feels in a card game  because sane people acknowledge the difference between a card designation and a fighter pilot.some people just want to move pieces around and have fun  as opposed to hearing someone drone on about their fictional life for thirty minutes.
@backup368  well  there has to actually be something there to develop...
dealing with loneliness sounds tiresome after 3 games of family drama.
exactly. this is the problem with higher education in general.
why every characther has to be lgbt do you hear yourself  are you kidding me  you seriously think that   literally 95 of games have straight protagonist   in which damn world you live
they dont care.ask yourself since this craze started if anyone has ever lost a sexual or a romantic attraction.its pretty obvious that their only interest is turning characters homosexual.
oh  I almost forgot this was a reboot series. I guess amanda everett didn t exist yet. ...anyone ever lowkey simp on amanda
wait.. who s kurt
angel of darkness.
naaah...  natla is the only one!
@   r  ll   gr    the legend series. she met amanda with a group of archaeologist  tomb raiders  while in her last years of college in peru. they dont have a romantic relationship  more of a chaotic friends to enemies and back and forth kind of relationship. but wont mind seeing it rebooted.
@   r  ll   gr    kurt is the spy she had sexual chemistry with in  angel of darkness it wasn t an official relationship  but the tension was wild!
@cs. a.   thats some sugar mommy issues right there! I wouldn t mind seeing lara and natla having some type of sexual chemistry thrown back and forth!
melonie outta be aware that this is not the same lara croft from 1996. they ve had a different lara croft since 2009 2010.
this video gave me an aneurism. who s really losing sleep over these leaks of her being more humanized   not being a blank boring character lol
89 days til  halloween
melonie  I get what your saying  I do  fuck woke  I hateeeee woke more than anything. but  the days of lara shooting dinosaurs is over  we want realistic lara  reboot lara is the sexiest lara we ve ever gotten for 1  and the fans dont want her to change physically in anyway so when Ive seen you make videos and they made her woke in that way it makes zero sense. tomb raider going forward has to have a deep story  and bring an arcady run and shoot just doesnt do it these days. the 2013 reboot is the best selling and most popular tomb raider game of all-time  I believe the next game is going to be dope af.
is bayonetta the last female badass
I called it flopping money pit on fb
why are they trying to make a last of us 3 with dual pistols and caves
yeah but the ip got sold off to some nobody company. I have no clue what sqaureenix was thinking. they are like the new ea of japan
yes! I get this
Im not surprised that they are making lara a lesbian  I was expecting her to get with sam at the end of the first reboot game
what ever happens I hope we get the sassy sexy badass laura back but of course devs want to modernize her so there gona go the twitter route
5 6  is short when youre 6 4 .
damn im getting tired of ask the pandering going on lately
almost positive lara croft is asexual
boom here comes the boom!
I am an old tomb raider fan I dont like going back to classic era rather than a new idea or a mix between the new lara and classic one.
dude is like these nutjobs are allergic to money  profit and success.
mel  everytime when I post a comment  bot accounts like alex chaudharI  badookum  thedarkwanderer   more of these bot account greaseballs pop up out of nowhere   start twisting  bully   disagreeing with everyone for having a opinion   comment about something that isn t any of their damn business
I hope it isnt real because if it was like it I would never buy it. oh and the survivor trilogy wasnt bad even shadow of the tomb raider it wasnt destroying who lara really is that much but if that was real then this is just not her.
I know its not a populair opinion but I actually  lite the reboot games and this leak a lot more then the old tomb raider games. its a lot more relatable I dont want to look up to this fantasy person I like realistic things a lot more. I also like her character model a lot more more human. for me this is amazing news. but hey everyone their own opinion right.  dont be mad please
we haven t had the same lara croft since 2003
@melonie mac go boom  so why is it only a problem now
she knows  why are you here btw  its obvious that you enjoy defending the woke agenda.
@backup368  its been a problem for a long time. not just now.
@backup368  because this is not how lara croft is
@a w  the sales suggest otherwise.
@backup368  if the sales were satisfactory square-enix wouldn t have sold the ip. so the sales numbers suck.
@a w  tomb raider is selling better than final fantasy  kingdom hearts and dragon quest games that have come out in recent years.
@zeros origin  link wore green until he didn t.
@backup368   a lot of people like it  therefore it must be good...  thats a logical fallacy.
@goodmachines   Im upset that it did well.
@backup368  high sales doesnt equal customer satisfaction. cyberpunk sold very well and that game was panned  just like you assume tomb raider s high sales means it deserves to be in smash bros. over other characters. thats becoming a shameless cash grab  not being a passion project
@goodmachines  why didn t tomb raider underworld sell well
@backup368  obviously not because its lara croft  because  in your mind  that must be why people keep buying her games  that its a famous franchise  and that it can do no wrong  despite the overall quality
@backup368  also  burnout. the studio was expected to churn out more games  and the quality suffered immensely for it.
@goodmachines  really  core design  were the ones that had to meet a deadline of one game each year. cd pretty much has been working on tomb raider games in 3-year development cycles since 2005.
@goodmachines  or maybe its because the series   the gameplay had gotten stale.
appreciate your support towards my channel 
if lara was like me she d be old and grumpy thank God she s nothing like me
Ive never been a fan of the bowing arrow lara. in my opinion thats definitely not the real lara croft.
coming in 2023 - grand theft auto - feeding the homeless!
hey  you just got dragged on zeducation for eating a stick of butter in your car lmao
remember... all this are rumors... now relax
they need to ruin beloved characters because they aren t creative enough to create new and interesting one.  the aaa industry in america is creatively and morally bankrupt. they want to reshape everything in their image. they think they are God.
but didnt square enix just sell tomb raider  so this is probly scraped.
kill cloud strife before its too late!!
what !  go boom boom boom
a shit tomb raider is going woke also I feared this will happen I can only dread what will happen to my other favourite series now deus ex
we want the original lara croft  strong  beautiful  curvy  smart and a lady like brittish upperclass badass..... anything else  go away !!! we dont want it !!!
they spitting at the face of the old fans. might as well drop the whole franchise and never buy it.
yeah the leak is worrisomenewer games keep trying to make her some action heroine or superheroine  the tomb raider  like its a title  she s the world s most renowned archeologist  her real title the gay part is at worse cheap marketing to take another female popular character and change them for identity politics and marketing  at best just another bad change to a character more about her work than her love life ironic  media tends to fault ideas where the female character is all about their relationship but immediately does so if its not straight
please dont create a game like that   lara croft lonely and support a kind of tombe raider group come on she is a strong perso adventure and explorer
why is crystal dynamics even involved with this project at all  I thought cd was under the square-enix umbrella and therefore would have no control over this  please leave lara alone already and let her get back to raiding tombs with no drama.
itsounds like they re trying to make the female indiana jones.
why do we want the same shit forlara over and over again weve had all that now in the classics games with her being a power icon and a selfesh murderer theres gotta be some parts to her thatshe has aleast some humanity about her
what dont you like about the tomb raiderreboot I happen to bea huge fan of thetomb raider franchise series mgm lost therights to tomb raider2 rise of the tomb raidermovie and the rights reverted back to crystaldynamics why are you soquick to slam the tomb-raider series. send me back and actualtext message what youdont like
have lara croft love women and have her do a different kind of tomb raiding now thats my favorite kind of fantasy. I dont mind if this comment is taken down this is my opinion
wow I guess I cant play this game anymore since im Christan
embracer seems to want to move forward with what crystal already started judging by their recent statements
square sold crystal dynamics and the tomb raider rights to embracer. sadly crystal is still developing the next game
@melonie mac go boom  oh no  thats horrible! I thought cd was still under s-e... troubling that they wont let tomb raider go!
tbh shadow lara came off to me as a bit of a les.
I feel like at this point if any female character is  strong and independent   she just has to be lesbian to fill up some quota. what the hell  what has happened to writing  also  what is this crippling depression plot they re going after I hope they are just throwing ideas and the script that was leak will be discarded soon or already has. I heard they got new writers not too long ago anyway.
its time crystal dynamics get fired. they are untalented  they re incompetent  they re arrogant  they are thick.
these people wanna destroy something original because they have nothing original.
at the end of this line they will even make ghost from mw gayjust wait and see
eu tenho 40 anos  jogo tomb raider desde quanto lan ou.... lara ter uma equipe  tudo bem.... mas se essa coisa de lesbianismo acontecer! eu simplesmente n o vou comprar mais. simples assim!
protecting artifacts  sounds like they re trying to spin her as an indiana jones rip off.
melonie mac I tagged u into a tomb raider movie tweet
lara croft a lesbian and I am out .....you can all buy it. I wont.
7 50  I dont want lara to look like me yep  I dont want my fantasies to look like me  I wanna look like them!!!!!!riddlin kids  uptight workaholics with zero imagination.
I know what you mean. Im gay and even I hate how they feel the need to make a loved character  woke . everyone loved her feminine power dynamic  but this woke culture is just ruining the character. no one likes this new lara anyway  why are they doing this  we all loved the classic lara. these are not tomb raider games  they re uncharted clones. listen to the fans crystal dynamics !
ooooooooooh no. I guess you didn t see the leaks about gta6 yet.
well thats just great.dont buy the game. straight up.
maybe melanie should write a tomb raider game instead of letting femmosjws write them all.  she thinks is bad  try being a fan of wolfenstein and living with what they did to wolfenstein iI a few years ago.
get woke go .

6 666 views on this video ... so it must be true lol
woke raider.
the last of us iii
they should grange her name because this is no tumb raider.
exactly
I d rather not see her interested in anyone.
4 hours later..........
I hate everything about this leak  I especially dislike the fact that they re gonna make lara a lesbian... as a massive tomb raider fan and a gay guy myself I honestly dont see it for her.. why make her gay  just to be edgy  I hate that.. either make her straight or just dont give her any romance at all tbh...
cd are a d c- studio...they got insanely lucky to have been given tr...cant say much to their only original ip s  they sure as hell haven t touched them since gaining tr. they follow the standard basic female lead hollywood plots  they copy what is popular and falls behind each time. every time they get a chance to do right by tr...they prove me right that they are the worse choice for tr.
is she a strong female character who turns lesbian because we cant have her in a relationship with a shocker a man.
street fighter did the same thing with cammy  internet teens got thirsty for her  character model so they updated her sexuality as lesbian..
none of this is confirmed so Im pretty sure this draft will be scrapped. literally no one supports this direction.
why cant we just get legend time line lara back plsssss I dont  want thrashI reboot lara
ugh just leave her aloooooone  why now everyone have to have a partner  or romance  bs
boom.
ah fuck Im getting tlou 2 vibes. its going to be God awfull isn t it
melonie  some one is using your image on here  see highlighted reply below mine.   3rd one down.  just wanted to let you know.
team lara not lara with team
isa. 5 20 woe unto them that call evil good  and good evil  that put darkness for light  and light for darkness  that put bitter for sweet  and sweet for bitter.
and where are her dual pistols and shorts
vote with thou shekels folks!
I dont know why they keep trying to make her a hero especially after shadow of the tomb raider. all her skills basically make her a beast of a killer.....and of course they want to make her gay.....God I am so sick of all this gayness and Imean that in the the 90 s way.what kills me was thatshe totally was giving not Jesus the eye in rise or at least it felt like she was feeling him
guess its time to skip this one
anita sarkeesian s influence on the gaming industry needs to fucking end.
I have changed my twitter colour to yellow.
or the og lara plssss but no reboot lara
easy pass
lara croft  saving sacred artifacts from misogynist colonizers  kissing girls at every port of call  proudly proclaiming her pronouns  which are not  she  and  her   protesting at a dave chappelle show  and throwing abortion showers for her friends  all this  and more  in  lara croft  rise of the woke !
your 35  me too! everyone else  no one cares.
everything woke turns to sh t doesnt even cover it. .star wars  dr who  star trek  marvel  dc  lotr  40k and battletech...now tomb raider  is there nothing these woke vandals wont ruin  rhetorical question... of course not....
well...it was a good run overall   I predict the man made global warming hoax agenda being front and centre ...rip tomb raider...rip lara.
omg please no romance in  tomb raider omg please noooooo   I just want my bad asss lara back. bring back cold lara.
people today will cry having to shoot tigers  I hate this generation who ruin fun by interjecting their own real world bs.
taa vs dlss comparison - shadow of the tomb raider https   youtu.be w-ycmthvkci
hate is a strong word. however... I hate the new concept. screw that... im done with crystal dynamics
everyone knows thatshe has to be into chicks cuz like straight chicks cant like be badasses and stuff. sarcasm
wont be good unless it has girl on girl action.
tifa lockheart can beat up laura croft and she s hotter too
all the leaks suck! Im gonna skip this one
I think your view of lara croft is wrong. lara isn t a power fantasy but is your fantasy.
lara croft deserves more. the games were so bad ass for ps1. to me  gaming isnt the same n they just produce garbage. n so sick of the woke bs. the weak will never lead in the world.
sounds corny af. they still need to discuss putaI saving lara after revelation.
the fragile dudes lol.
as a gay guy... if they make lara a lesbian ill be officially done with tomb raider. this is soo disappointing but predictable.
this is horrible. core design... please come back.
making lara gay is just cheap noise to get attention
bro  you win the internet for today
oh boy. I cant wait to play as lara croft s lesbian girl friend because lara got killed in the first hour of the game by super-ma am with......a tennis racket. then proceed to play as super-ma am and the video game treats me in a bad way because lara killed super-ma am s t-rex dad and you should feel bad because you like lara killing the t-rex. you bigot.
I dont think I like them making lara croft lgbt. I think I ll be skipping the next game its all good though I have 6 older great tomb raider game I can go back and play instead.
why is your face glowing    cant see properly your facial features because of that glow even at low screen brightness levels !!
ofc she will become lesbian...and I guess in some future games she will have some sort of  skin accident  and she will also become black...because  why not !    ddddd
they just keep fucking up tomb raider
its like turning every eating establishment vegan by the next few years as an presbyterian I find it way too much of thisgoing around in every day culture.
apparently you cant be a strong female character unless youre a lesbian
nice hair
timeline tomb raider was ground breaking and unique till this day . uncharted was inspired by tomb raider . tomb raider copied uncharted
just like with agent 47 from hitman. the movies had to give him some sort of love interest. the timothy olyphant version is most cringe worthy play flirting with a hooker.  uuggghhh
thanks. I hate it.
ugly people and people dating ugly people  inside or outside  hate original laura croft so dont be that ugly person.
I dont mind if lara is flirtatious  but I think she needs to stay unattainable.
I give up on ever seeing the old style tr atleast for a long while ..  cd is such a
Im a gay guy and I dont like the romance stuff. not because its with a women but because its not necessary. I dont want to see that  with men or with women. I just want to raid tombs.
they should cut all the soppy emotional bull
lesbian lara  they re going to give her the feminist shaved undercut with side fringe too  aren t they   lara croft doesnt have girlfriends or boyfriends  such matters are beneath her need to explore and raid tombs!
if lara croft is gay.... oh  how they will fall.... and not many will buy this game at that point. we want the original lara. not the one of todays woke wrighters.
females who are 5 0  can be extremely threatening  height is not the determining factor.
keep politics out of games  sick woke culture
she shot the perverts at the end of tomb raider 2
a 5 0  woman is not gonna stand a remote chance fighting men way bigger than her. lara being about the size of the male characters added a visually more threatening appearance  undeniably.
from tomb raider to womb raider. fml. they cant stop with the crap. this is coming from a fear effect fan which if you dont remember is a game with a lesbian lead.
what the crap is a  team of tomb raiders   how is that a thing  and why is she a lesbian all of a sudden
melonie use some of that butter for your hair please. looking stiff as hell.
is melonie white
looks like Im definitely not buying this one... the lesbian thing doesnt even bother me though. protecting artefacts  team of  tomb raiders   dfuq
its the apocalypse lgbt
ok Im sick of western games I ll stick to my japanese and jrpg games
this is why Im not even a fan the reboot is like bad fan fiction game  I always love tr legend and anniversary also tr classic from 90 s  and tr reboot is trash.
stop saying power fantasy! stop saying power fantasy! stop saying power fantasy! youre so annoying! lara croft is not a donut bumper. period.ok now on to my opinion  Im always on the fence with this series. if they go this route  Im done. she s an attractive female. I dont want to see her with a woman.and Im just going to say this  they say if you dont like this kind of stuff then youre homophobic. well  if they think most of their customers think this way  then why would they make a product that they know their customer base wont like  are you trying to make money or push an agenda that pisses people off  most people are straight. most gamers are straight males. sex and violence always sell. when are we going to get back to that
I didn t need lara as lesbian. its such a cheap shot to try and gain some weird audience. they can only wreck old loved characters.
melody Jesus you need to calm down girl  like I get that you get bent out of shape about this but just let it go  eventually someone will make what you like  as these things go in cycles  hell what we need is the japanease to start making their own knock off of this  as God I am so glad that culture is structured to be super antI woke  which inadvertently makes a market for badass females in badass games.as between them and the french  their the only ones holding it down for western culture
if they make lara croft gay  I can see it.  its not like she ever liked any men beyond them being jokes or villains  and Im talking back in the 90 s.what you think this woke crap is new   oh hell no.
crystal dynamics have killed tomb raider franchise uurraah  boycottcrystaldynamics
ah  the make everything bI gay trend  ok.
looks like I wont be playing this new reboot.  I did enjoy the 2013 reboot trilogy.  but  if the turn lara to a lesbian I wont be playing it.
inspired by naughty dog  sounds more like they re straight up copying them.they have no idea who they should be marketing to. its pandering. plain and simple. pandering to people who dont even play the games. what a hot mess.
shadow of the tomb raider was trash and now this smh
so over this crap... if this is real I will not buy it.
this would be the last nail in the coffin for the series if they go with this garbage story line.
I dont know why gay men are asked about wlw lara croft  they represent the entire lgbtqia community now   cause every single queer women Ive spoken with is really happy about wlw lara  just saying.dont speak for us thanks.
white and native mixed
@melonie mac go boom im sorry about the native part sweetcheeks
nope nope nope not playing laura as a lesbian.not doing it.im a gay man and im tired of all this crap.I dont understand women can he sexy anymore and why they always have to have this lesbian l butch vibe.just cause your tough doesnt mean you have to look like a dude
shit pass that game
grounded sucks I prefer video games and their characters larger than life stop making everything into a real world simulation grrrrr
how long till we make laura a trans-man that had hormone therapy
why this mania of making strong and badass woman in lesbians or bI  women dont need to be lgbt to be badass
if this ends up being a lesbian drama fest  I will stay away from this game the same way I stayed away from tlou2. no thanks. I want badass 90s lara who is 6  tall and has dds. I dont want a 5 6  miserable lesbian cat lady with armpit hair.
sounds terrible.
well...this sounds awful.
lame.
laura was supposed to be lose cannon women not this  like why video games keep pushing lgbt stuff on main characters what s next  sub zero become gay for scorpion  gta becoming soft.
notmylaracroft needs to be a trend if the leaks are true
one criticism on this video  yes as a gay man I dont like when games just put shit like that for fan service and there was no hints of her being gay or bisexual in the games before. but I dont think gay men are the right demographic to comment on this. gay women are the ones thatshould be asked about their input about this situation. its not our place as gay men to comment on a lesbian representation in media.
characters change and so do people. representation s always been a thing too. its just becoming more of a thing now. I dont understand this whole woke complaint nonsense some people go to. people should just wait and see how things unfold more before being a reactionary. change can be good or bad but what s good or bad is subjective. woke gets used way too much. its a word thats used to explain something some people use when they dont like or agree with something. oh no there s a black character in my media  woke. this character s gay  woke. one of the protagonist is going to be a female  woke.
nathan drake
anybody can have an opinion on anything they want to
@melonie mac go boom  its not so much about having an opinion but also speaking about what representation a certain group need or does not need. for example my opinion is that I think its pointless and stupid and just forced but idk how the lesbian community feels about it or if they have enough representation in popular media I cant speak about their feelings. my point is that you said  even gay men are not okay with this  but gay men aren t the ones thatshould have their opinions be used as an example in this situation  its gay women. thats what Imean.
character that has existed for 26 years  has been portrayed as either straight or atleast aromantic  all of a sudden becoming gay is not organic representation.
@charming peasant  a story s going to be told. no one knows how thats going to turn out. nor what the interactions between the characters will be like. its speculation  assumptions and the game hasn t even been released yet.
@speed beyond logic  its literally in the leaked information  one that was officially taken down by square enix and crystal dynamics  giving it a great deal of legitimacy.
@charming peasant  do you know anything about the character who s going to be laura s love interest  or how their interactions are going to play out  she s going to have a gay love interest. people have love interests in videogames. even if they hadn t in a while or at all. sometimes that changes. the character changes. dont have to like or agree with it but thats just how things go sometimes. you can wait until the game gets released and play it or watch someone else play it and decide then if its good to you or not and if you like it.
