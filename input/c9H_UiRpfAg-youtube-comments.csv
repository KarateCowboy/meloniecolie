this show isn t a love-letter to tolkien. its a stalker ex-girlfriend standing outside tolkien s home  throwing chunks of brick through the windows.
if you ever feel like youre bad with money just remember amazon spent a billion dollars on this and itstill looks cheap
they are not desecrating tolkien s legacy.  they are outing themselves as those who try and fail to desecrate tolkien s legacy.
jeff   I want the most expensive stuff for this show  because expensive equals good! assistant   diversity hires are the most expensive my Lord jeff   yes! bring me those
discount eowyn perpetually on the rag   best description Ive heard yetwhat they did to galadriel is the most disrespectful destruction of a character Ive ever witnessed in my lifetime
where did the budget go   and  how can any writer except millions of dollars for sludge without having any kind of shame or guilt   are my questions.
p.s. my wife pays no attention to any of this. she does not watch youtube  have twitter  pay attention to entertainment news  etc. Imade her watch the first episode of the show. she made me turn it off 20 minutes in. one of her comments was  why would amazon cheap out on the budget of such a valuable property
you showed far more grace toward jaffe in both videos than he showed toward you.
even the way she s holding those swords is hilarious.I dont know how much their fight coreographer was paid  but as a hema instructor I could do better for less.
one thing Im sure we can agree upon with the hobbit  the battle of the five armies is that  galadriel goin   full galadriel   was one of the most awesome not-exactly-canon decisions that peter jackson ever made. no sword or chest-binder armor necessary. just a dismissive flick of the wrist to obliterate an orc  and pure photo-negative awesomeness to banish sauron.
even if the fight choreography in thatscene were ace  the idea of galadriel  high elf of the noldor  lady of light  daughter of finarfin  niece of feanor  future bearer of nenya  getting into a scrap with some co-ed human street toughs is ludicrous beyond measure.
remember when aragorn deflected the dagger the uruk captain threw in the fellowship of the ring  ah  good times.
keep in mind morfyyd clark said she needed therapy after some of these intense fight scenes...
the one thing I cant get with galadriel is how short she is  she is freaking tiny in this show. in the books she s 6 4  and in the movie she feels and looks like it. honestly  they could have given the money to youtubers and they could have made a better more accurate show.  you said nothing wrong in the video  he s the one who thinks that criticism equals misogyny  it doesnt.
amazon  Lord of the cringe. on the bright side  sometimes it takes a billion   debacle like this to make yourealize just how timeless and well written tolkien s works are and always will be. all the money in the world cant buy you that kind of heart and creativity.
I can see why the lead actress needed therapy after filming her fighting scenes!
melonie  I appreciate how you get right into your videos instead of how other channels will ramble on and seemingly never get to the point. you are a breath of fresh air.
thank you melanie for watching this garbage  so we dont have to!
I love how there s one person with a sword standing behind her with every opportunity in the world to strike to get a promotion in rank but that would defeat the entire point of the scene they re failing to make
I dont think you did anything wrong as far as the gow director goesnot only was he wrong  but you could tell he took it extremely personal. people have called out plenty of properties which starred involved male leads that were bad. the reason its been easier to call out female led properties is because they ve just been coming out in droves recently.
and crapping in the bed!
@pondimus maximus   amber turd and the rings of power.  this is a title and plot more worthy than the actual show!
more like the guy who went to high school with him  spoke to him once  and tells everyone they used to be  good friends

or a bitter kid who tolkien used to pick on at school and is getting his revenge by ruining his legacy.
@bumhead film reviews n  stuff  that would be simon tolkien... simon is resentful of his grandfather s legacy actually and doesnt like being in thatshadow  rather the light  of it. he also has daddy issues with Christopher  so it makes perfect sense he d green light the making of rings of power.
well stated.
lmaooo
@ray a  exactly  I remember a showrunner gushing about how honored they were to have Christopher on board meanwhile that guy had his own bitter agenda to get revenge for his own failed career. like dude  if you were actually talented  you would ve stood out no matter what and the tolkien name would ve only benefited you the way most writers could never imagine. maybe you just suck
then she go home to dinner with her fam talking story about how her and tolkien had such a nice day together visiting this cute new brunch downtown
maybe they knew it would be a pile of shit and be a terrible return on the investment. so  they funneled half of the money back to themselves somehow and then will claim a billion dollar loss.. and probably gain the loyalty of more wokeys.
this analogy doesnt work with a company that profits and a majority owner with throw away money.
money laundering.
oh you think those billion dollars were actually spent on the show
thanx. I feel a bit better now about being broke
@afro ahmed  not really  I imagine most of it was spent on catering and other stuff...
but they sent the  to     !
they spent it all on cocaine  lotr  the lines of powder
looks cheap  what do you mean  rings of power has the most impresive cinematics we have ever seen on a tv show. people my not like the story but visually it is among if not the most impressive.
@k  big true
@ray a  if I can get rid of this hot product  script license  dump it off on someone who will royally fuck this up... but who wait... I know! tosses script into the literal feral bear cage in a zoo called twitter
@loria  my sentiments exactly. if simon was a good writer  then being a tolkien would actually be a good thing for him. but because he s not as successful as his grandfather  he s just blaming his lack of success on being in his shadow. his attitude about his father and grandfather make him the least worthy person on the planet to be in charge of the tolkien estate. it certainly appears as though he just wants to burn it all to the ground and make as much money off it as possible while doing so.  just pathetic.
@ray a  he will fail  he might be in charge of the estate but tolkiens books sit in millions of bookshelves all over the world and his stories have touched countless peoples lives  that is his true legacy. he will fail at tarnishing his grandfathers legacy just like he failed his own writing career.
great description of this crap show
lol
@ray a  there is always that one kid in the bloodline who will end it.
@lady anonymous  sadly  youre right.
@pauper s lament  maybe but but if cartoon villain bezos after all
@havek attacketh  some of it looks good  some of the effects look fake and some of the costumes look bad as well.
@havek attacketh  you mean the 3d printed plastic armor  it looks like bad cosplay costumes lol
if this is a love letter to tolkien  tolkien would have placed a restraining order on amazon to be at least 100 miles away from his property.
yeah.  men are weak . as elrond said. they had a billion dollars.the easiest slam dunk shot would have been just to go to peter jackson.but their ego and pride... and hollywood not wanting australians and new zealanders to run the show  just shot themselves in the foot so willingly.
honestly you shouldn t have an excuse like that
how  honestly where did the money go  no special effects of any quality and no major actors  seriously where did it go
@dean firnatine  I assume couple more multimillionaires added into amazon s ranks
come on man  amazon is a little indie movie company  they re trying.
@sean russell  im dying lol
250m where for the icense for the ip  that they basically totally ignored.cant make this shit up.
I reckon those two guys who wrote it  the ones who look like every teenage lad from the 90s  pocketed most of the dosh and only spent about 800 quid on the show.
should have just kept the money and give us discounts on the franchise stuff.
@cestep76  this seems like its on the right track to the actual truth.
@havek attacketh
they should just have used some cosplay costumes from their webshop.probably would have looked much better.edit  ah you also made that cosplay reference!  d
@gazb87yorkshiresalt  the figure spent on this show is chump change compared to the combined funds and arms cost of what nato countries have used to assist ukraine since 2014.
as long as they still deliver my slim jim s on time.
oh snap!!!!!
frfr. its ironic that r.o.p is the most expensive show ever made but its lighting and cgI looks like a fucking subaru advertisment.
@donte bennett  great actors and writing is all you need. classic doctor who had no budget  and was shot on unforgiving video tape. but because every person on the crew believed  it was still perfect.
@idawg  which ones
yeees exactly my thoughts ...at least someone bring that up
was wanting to point that out. its like trying to dunk on japan by saying the pyramids are ugly.
tolkiens legacy stands strong through his brilliant books  the peter jackson movies and in the hearts of the millions of people hes blessed with his stories throughout the years. this abomination of a show and everyone associated with it will forever be mocked and they will vanish into the dark abyss of irrelevance and cautionary tales where they belong.
bro  same was when amazon tried to make games  it had everything to success  Im mean it only had money really . crew was inexperinece and the expectetion of higher ups was fokin up to sky so..
not the most expensive to hire  though they will cost you a lot in the long run... the clear token black elf  token black dwarf etc... aren t even the bad parts of the show  I really dont care  its the rest thats the issue.
they re paying in the range of 10-30k per episode to the lead characters  so they re not expensive. they re extremely cheap. oh and isildur gets paid 20  more then galadriel. keep the wage gap myth alive!
thats where the money went cgi
@spig  I cant take anything seriously when all the tokens are there. it immediately reminds me of the ridiculous real world we are dealing with atm
actually they cost less
@mano z  ok    bit
@mano z  bot
@charlie dolengewicz  youre a bot  go away
@lucky strikez  fair enough  it doesnt bother me but I know why it annoys most for lotr.
unfortunately we cant afford the extras  maybe we should cut and paste the same character
@piotr rekos  at least the game looks good and kinda fresh and is not preaching at you
@spig  imagine living in eastern europe and getting someone s former slaves and colony whatevers shoved into your very european settings. create new interesting stories and worlds. stop appropriating what s not even yours
@considerablysane  pardon  what are you going on about  my country is the reason there isn t slavery in the world anymore  learn history before you jump into something and look stupid. also tolkien specifically stated how the races should be  spoiler alert they weren t black  he wrote lotr as a replacement for missing british mythology which was lost due to the many invasions so when talking about taking that which isn t yours  yes please stop doing that this is british myths created by a british man based on europe.
@spig  mayhaps I didn t write it clear enough  but this woke ideology  hailing from us  not uk  and forcefed down the throats of the rest of the world is their national trauma and complex  itshould have no reflection on cultural legacy of other countries and literary works to promote modern message that only has place in  5 countries in the world under the aegis of reflecting how the world is  small part of it . for all the classical educated english folk and brits at large  for their culture and literature and other media legacy  I have nothing but respect and love  otherwise I wouldn t study this language to an extent of reading and writing on it for any purpose but business.I would be delighted at rhun and harad exploration  but those untalented twats cant create anything new  they go around and take their dump on every ip. sometimes with ardent support of original creators  and then I can only sigh and shrug it off  but you cantell how they twist everything they touch.
@considerablysane  ah that makes more sense  your first comment was confusing.
dialogues are like kamala harris  speeches.  the future is present but later .  the border is secure so migrants to enter .  vaccines help others like books help those who are hungry .
@thomasc
@spig  I dont think it was confusing at all.
I d correct that diversity hire thing with 20 executive producers.
I like all the non-white performers actually  except cynthia addai-robinson who portrays numenor s queen regent  her performance is without energy or inspiration. there are a lot of problems with the series  the acting isn t awe inspiring nor is it bad  overall I think its really great just not something Im gonna still remember compared to the original movie cast 20 years from now. the real problem is who ever hired the writers should be fired  they took a shI  on tolkien s story and twisted itso much I couldn t even figure out where in the book we were in the first episode. the directors and producers failed on various production departments and many scenes  like at the end of the recent episode with the entire army of numenor so small and pathetic using three small sailing ships going to convince the entire population of  lower men  on all of middle earth to become vassals slaves to them as  8ft tall and blessed by the Gods in every way compared to all other men  except they aren t because of whoever made this version numenor. the visual effects are truly amazing though  the best part of the series so far.
all the jack daniels needed to wash away the shame of working on this show has to cost mad money.
based wife
never happened.
@dragon ball fans cant read  probably not in every dimension.
money laundering
@aj souza  this would be one of the worst attempts at money laundering ever. money laundering requires a functioning profit center with good cashflow. this show ain t that.
could not agree more.  I never heard of this guy and Im glad I haven t played his games.  the derogatory terms he used when referencing her shows what he is and the shield he is using to hide behind.  he s a pos.
he has consumed too many soy based products.
completely agree
best example is local theatre group fight dancing.
@dave vd  rings of power is filmed infront of a live audience
thats one of the aggravating things. its not like there aren t any experts on hema or other fighting styles out there. that it looks as bad as it does because they didn t want to have an expert or have it look good.
hey  ive watched a few skallagrim vids  I could do better!
they could ve had the swords just float around her parrying blows  and it would be more lore accurate to galadriel student of melian.
I suspected that the actress just wasn t any good at the choreography and thats about the best they could do with her. got had some of the same problems with the character of jamie lannister. we rarely see him fight and some hema guys have pointed out that nikolaj coster-waldau is just bad at sword fights so they worked around this by not showing much of him. similarly   with this actress they are just working with someone with no talent for sword fights. she really was laughable in the scene we just saw.
@solve for  x   absurd  but kinda true
@mikepette  that music though  Lord of the rings or Lord of the dance
fight coreographer
it looks like those choreographies from chinese movies lol
Ive seen better fight choreography at ww 2 reenactments and laser tag games.
I understand why she needed therapy for them now
@camila costa  you ve clearly never seen one. hollywood is literally the only entertainment industry that promotes garbage fight scenes. john wick s an exception and thats only because chad stahelskI and keanu reeves were taught by yuen woo-ping on how to shoot fight scenes and the importance of training the actors to become physically capable of doing them.
I have no trading and even I can do better. but then again I grew up watching lotr and other such movies.
thatscene was so good despite me having a lot of issues with that movie as a whole haha
yea galadriel was powered up for the movies from the books.
@games and nonsense  not really. they may have made thatscene up for the hobbit movies but galadriel is described as one of the two most powerful eldar in valinor before they ever even came to middle earth. she s arguably more powerful than any of the maiar except for sauron himself  and he is far from his full strength when he is separated from the one ring.
@brian davis  I dont think she s powerful than any maiar  discounting sauron . they re maiar lol. she s still an elf.
@queen beruthiel  balrogs are maiar too and feanor  the only elf who might have been more powerful than her  killed an unknown number of them before being mortally wounded by gothmog. ecthelion of the fountain killed 3 unnamed balrogs and died killing gothmog himself. gandalf died killing a single balrog  although he probably had far fewer limitations on the use of his power when he was sent back.the only being in middle earth more powerful than her would be sauron with the one ring in his possession.
@brian davis   she s arguably more powerful than any of the maiar except for sauron himself easy on the koolaid pal.the ability she had to deal with sauron was one of willpower rather than any kind of strength that you would measure in physical magic terms in a classical fantasy sense. this being said 3rd age sauron would not be all that he was in the 1st and 2nd age even w o the one ring  and less still than his will was with the ring luthien also battled and won against sauron in much the same way.itshould not surprise no one of decent lore knowledge that the common element between luthien and galadriel is their teacher mentor  luthien s mother melian the maiar  queen of doriath  and thus all middle earth as thingol s wife .melian was regarded as one of the wisest among all the maiar  whereas gandalf ol rin was merely regarded as the wisest among the istarI wizards of the maiar sent to middle earth.galadriel was a lot of things but compared to even luthien she would have been a lesser being in willpower - compared to melian she would have been a flickering candle to a blinding light.
@brian davis   balrogs are maiar too in a sense that they are lesser ainur  yes.but to call them equal to sauron and gandalf in terms of willpower or intelligence is a joke - the balrog s sole capability was in battle while the likes of sauron mairon  melian and gandalf olorin were far beyond those meagre creatures.it might be said that the balrogs became too much  of the world   sacrificing the greater part of their divine spirit for physical power - and in so doing became vulnerable in ways that most maiar would not be so easily disposed of.
@brian davis  I still disagree. you said maiar not balrogs. you seem to forget that maiar were lesser beings only after the valar and eru himself. they helped create the universe  the world and everything in it. we never knew what the maiar in valinor who refuses to go to middle earth were capable of. the istarImight be less powerful than galadriel but they  with their full power and might  in their full maiar form   are certainly more powerful than her.
exactly. it was a great non tolkien canonic scene which was suitable to her figure. she banished and humiliated sauron by her strong magic and not cheap sword movements which look more like dance cha cha cha moves
the fact the most powerful mage of middle earth that can destroy armies and level fortresses with her magic twirling around with a sword is already heresy.
@dave vd   I had a similar reaction to seeing yoda whip out a lightsaber in the prequels.  its all wrong.  groan inducing.
nah yoda with a lightsaber is at least believable. galadriel was a power unto her own. the power of mordor was unable to enter lothlorien because of a power far greater than the darkness. in star wars galadriel would be like an embodiment of the living force. she d have walked into the senate chamber and the dark side would ve retreated before her. palpatine would ve been unable to summon the force in her presence. would be an amazing scene now that I envision it  lol
@micah price  yes  its believable in the sense that its reasonable to assume that an aged jedImaster is schooled in swordplay  but its inappropriate and gratuitous to show  imo.  yoda s real power is in the depths of his wisdom and his venerability.  vulgar displays of raw power are beneath him.
@bezo razo  star wars was always a little bit   cheap and childish  though no  dont get me wrong  I loved all the old films  but the writing style is certainly more on the nose than other fantasy stories.
@animism_rs  yes  thats true  though much less so in the ot.  renowned scholar of comparative mythology  joseph campbell  lauded the ot as an excellent and timeless modern telling of  the hero s journey   so he evidently saw more in it than just a tawdry and juvenile bit box office entertainment.  had he lived to see them  I highly doubt he would ve held the subsequent releases in the same lofty esteem.but tolkien it ain t.  I ll grant you that.
@micah price  you just came up with a better scene that is closer to the lore in a cross-over star wars middle-earth series than rings of power did.  bravo!
@ray a  thank you! but to be fair.. the rings of power writers didn t even pick the bar up  much less raise it to any appreciable height..
@micah price  true  but I appreciated the visual all the same.
@micah price  to be fair much of her power came from the ring. she had much on her own but her ring gave much of the defensive power she used to keep her land safe.  another problem is numenor s army is supposed to be the finest fight force in tolkien s own writing. they defeated and captured sauron on more then one occasion before his defeat. they only fell because they went against the divine beings in vallinor because they wanted the secret of immortality. in the show those soldiers she s beating should be able to beat her handily especially when multiple attack together.
@bezo razo  I would say the emperor using a lightsaber was worse as he refers to the lightsaber in the return of the jedI as a   a jedI s weapon  . he seemed to view them as toys.
@greg smith  that was a glaring inconsistency  youre right  and he s another one I would ve said was beyond swordfighting.  but I have a weakness for ian mcdiarmid who can simply do no wrong in my eyes  so I give him a pass for any cinema sins
@brad miles  yeah. I felt that they stole a couple of her movements from thranduil in five armies  the spinning and such. the difference is  lee pace is incredible in the role of thranduil and looks and acts the part. he s a character you can empathize with and one who also commands respect  and fear.
@micah price  well the choreography in the hobbit movies was pretty bad a lot of the time. partially I blame it on jackson having to take over  right before shooting began. he inherited the project so once they had things established it was hard to change it.
bezos would just tell us its nenya business I ll show myself out.....
@bezo razo   I had a similar reaction to seeing yoda whip out a lightsaber in the prequels.  its all wrong.  groan inducing. to be brutally fair you can groan all you want - what the creator says goes is what goes as far as star wars is concerned.you only have to take one look at yoda to know that it was lucas pushing that bankable merchandising angle by making him a puppet instead of a human.that being said it does mean that the buck for the prequels stops entirely with his talentless  ss for the writing  direction and ludicrous overuse of cgI vfx - the uptick in film making quality and dialogue from anh to esb shows what an independent writing and directing team could do vs lucas alone  and he chose to embrace megalomania over objective reason instead for the prequels.
@micah price   the power of mordor was unable to enter lothlorien because of a power far greater than the darkness.  in star wars galadriel would be like an embodiment of the living force stop drinking the pj koolaid please.jackson massively overplayed galadriel s role and capabilities in the lotr and hobbit trilogy.she has power significantly beyond the average elf yes - as an elf born under the light of the trees and niece of feanor.she has skill yes - as a student of melian  whose daughter luthien tinuviel also won a battle of wills with sauron during the 1st age.because that is all the interaction in the hobbit was - a battle of wills  everything else is just peter jackson trying to make the hobbit into an lotr prequel  rather than the opposite.
@bezo razo   yoda s real power is in the depths of his wisdom and his venerability.  vulgar displays of raw power are beneath him you also need to bear in mind the context of yoda in the ot both from a film making perspective and from a story perspective. 1. yoda s movement is constrained by the puppet.frank oz et al cant work miracles  his movement was written to reflect this limitation and emphasized his age to curtail any need for serious physical interaction with luke. 2. as a mentor yoda s aim is to guide luke gradually to prevent a repetition of vader.to emphasize combat and physical skills would be to risk tainting him even further than his age experinece already has  so he emphasizes control  and realisation of the shadow self   only what you take with you   that the dark side propagates from.making luke aware of the dark side like that wasn t accidental - the point was to shock him early with the cave and show him how easily he could become vader through loss of control  that didn t require yoda to even be there  and this is masterful writing from lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett. brackett is the unsung co writer on the empire strikes back script - in my opinion she was likely responsible for much of the amazing written chemistry between han and leia  its a huge step up from anh
@brad miles   she had much on her own but her ring gave much of the defensive power she used to keep her land safe defensive power I think you are confused - its power is to preserve.as immortal beings their main concern is the preservation of the things around them that otherwise contiinue to decay while they do not.that is why they all have to leave after the one ring s destruction somehow breaks all of the others - their kingdoms are all beginning to fall apart  and unlike men they do not have the numbers left to rebuild them  many had already left for valinor by the time of sauron s final play for middle earth at the end of the 3rd age .
@mountain nomad vfx  I was referring to before the destruction of the ring.  its in the professors own writings that nenya was what helped galadriel keep lothlorien hidden from sauron s gaze. yes you are correct it was the nenya that kept the tress growing and once its power faded the beautiful forest began to age and wither by the time arwen was buried there it was ruins because not long after galadriel departed celeborn also left since most elves left for rivendell so he followed them.
exactly why the hell would I use physical strength when I can just point ine finger and destroy everything
I immediately replayed thatscene in my head after reading your comment. you know its good when moments like thatstick in your head after all these years. rop could never!
apparently the actor playing the uruk haI was supposed to throw it past viggo mortensen s head but had vision trouble due to his mask   ended up throwing it directly at viggo. he somehow managed to deflect it   the director kept thatscene in because it was so good.
@k m  viggo learned swordsmanship to do his own stunt  and it definitely paid off.
@korawit buttramee  it did. he was really invested in the role. he is also a rider   an avid outdoorsman. broke his toes when he kicked the helmet but stayed in character and completed the take. simply brushed it off later saying the stunt guys had more injuries than he did.
dont remind me it hurts to remember good stuff
she s going to need more than just therapy.  I dont think she can rescue her career in acting.
I have no idea what she meant by that. did she injure herself during the fights  or was it...what was it
muscle therapy  like a massage
@notes from the underground  she basically got muscle pain such a strong independent wahman. jackie chan at least broke 10 bones still continues. tom cruise broke his leg at 1 37 https   www.youtube.com watch v sjn3ellcy2u she s pathetic.
did she need therapy cuz the scenes are so awful
apparently it was  traumatic  to have other actors charge at you. imagine the vfx people who has to churn out effects on shit pay and crunch hours.
therapy before the fight scenes - it was to teach her not to flinch when someone swings a sword at her head. therapy  was a very poor choice of words on her part.she should have said she went through combat training to prepare for the fight scenes.
she was hired for her communication skills  not for her.. oh wait
its not understandable. it looks more like dancing
omg same  it is so jarring to see galadriel so smol!
by the same argument you can adopt a book. let s say romeo and juliet and make something entirely else out of it. let s say a science fiction horror thriller. let s throw everything to the bin which defines romeo and juliet and make something entirely different. but now the kicker  we call our science fiction horror thriller  romeo and juliet   and if someone watches it who is expecting a lovestory  lololol trolled!! so funny!!this is what is happening in modern entertainment. with the addition that people like you make fun of completely rational behavior. this shit is not even solely to storytelling related. its how expectations work in real life and of course they function the same in fiction.frodo is a defined character. defined by all the traits which make him distinguishable from others. one of them is being a hobbit. hobbits are small. so frodo is small. that is the expectation. if now in some scenes frodo is bigger than elves it would break with the expectations in a bad way  therefore break immersion.galadriel being small is the very same. she has to be huge. this is one of the defining traits of their race. they are all tall and lean. just like in the real world there could be a tall hobbit or a fat elf. and you can integrate those in fantasy. but to make it believable they have to seem like an actual exception and they have to be their own thing. you cant take established characters and redefine the how you like. thats now how this works. and the world has actually to react to their difference or its just bad casting camera work.
@metal melee  that is such a childish and disingenuous point to try and make about an entire universe created by someone over their entire life. tolkien s work isn t just  a unicorn  or even make believe. he hand crafted an entire realm  a whole world  races of people and gave them individual identities  created races of creatures and even created specific identities within those creatures. tolkiens  Lord of the rings  isn t just 1 book of fiction. its an entire catalog of books that literally hand crafted an entire world. he literally created his own language for middle earth. he studied ancient languages throughout history and used his extensive knowledge to craft character names that fit within that language and then built their entire identities to fit within his vision of middle earth. this isn t just some half assed story here that people can rewrite. he wrote more than 29 books with most of them dedicated to building this world of middle earth. this isn t just 1 poem that is vague and unspecific with a general character who you can exchange for anyone you can imagine. this isn t just  fiction  is the broad sense of you canthink anything you want about it. tolkien had a very specific image in mind when he created all these works and he painstakingly described every little detail possible to paint that image for you as a viewer. for some asshat to come in almost 100 years later and just start changing core details of his world because they want to push a narrative is disrespectful to say the least and entitled beyond belief. there is such a thing as artistic integrity and respect for the creator when you want to try and take their work and make money off it. if these people just wanted to make unicorns any color they wanted they could have written their own story. they didn t need to try and skate on the coat tails of one of the most celebrated humans to ever live.
@metal melee  well seeing as we dont know who invented unicorns we dont know but we do know who invented Lord of the rings and the species held within. and we know what color he made those species. also there are stories written by people who look the way these people want the characters to look. we could just tell those stories. there is no reason to be telling european stories starring africans when we have african stories we cantell. its racist to instead of telling black stories just replace white people in white stories with black people. thats racist to both races!!!
her height is the least of my worries
its not working is it   she needs to be tall and regal not short and whiny
@metal melee  I find it jarring you could like such a poorly written  poorly directed  and poorly acted inconsistent dumpster fire of a show. if you you throw out all the lore and make it a new universe its still objectively bad.
Im confused by the couldn t.  imho   it would have made more sense to say they could ve given the money to youtubers and they could ve made a better   more accurate show.  if the sentence ended in a   it would have made some sense. this isn t me being pedantic.  just saying that how things are written is how the reader tries to understand what the writer is saying.
hey  thats a good nickname    amazon  Lord of the cringe.
not just tolkien s original works but the jackson lotr films - not perfect by any means but clearly driven by passionate people with a lot of respect for the source material.
yep. after watching the first two episodes I had to watch the jackson trilogy  just to confirm tolkien isn t really shit. Ive also re-reading the books. rop is an abortion.
@melonie mac go boom  they had a billion dollars.the easiest slam dunk shot would have been just to go to peter jackson.but their ego and pride... and hollywood not wanting australians and new zealanders to run the show  just shot themselves in the foot so willingly.
@lisa pop  youre right  I was on my typing iphone and didn t notice lol
@metal melee  no I am not the problem. the people want artistic accuracy to original creator are not the problem. there are plenty of people today who create their own fabulous and marvelous universes and worlds. stan lee is another brilliant human who created an entire industry around his creativity. his stories got turned into movies and they were successful beyond belief because they stuck to his original vision. you know when they started to not be successful  when they deviated from the original vision and uncreative  entitled leftists started deciding they would use his work to push their own narrative and change core details like someone s race. thats the problem. the problem is the idiots who think they can just race swap or gender swap a role and slap a new coat of paint on an old story and  sell it  and be just as successful as the original creator. that is the problem. the people who see through this bullshit aren t the problem.
@metal melee  Im not remotely placing unrealistic expectations. I expect the show to be consistent with basic things. it is funny though how you go to insults since you cant back up your claims. you just claim its great without any reasoning given. I can give you pages of  pointing out the inconsistent writing  multiple non sequiturs in the dialogue per episode  general cutting corners  and contradictions in the lore they setup themselves. your the one who came into this thread attacking someone else and I responded. if you dont like the majority opinion of people in the thread and in the video why are you watching it  just to come in here to complain
@metal melee  so you came onto the channel to be negative to the creator to get the creator more money. the logic in that is pretty shoddy but keep backpedaling. you say you dont read any of it but yet I see youresponding to alot of it. not sure how that works man. also no negative comments dont always get more response. Ive seen many channels where the comment with the most replies was positive about the video.
@metal melee  the irony is everything youre claiming about me would equally apply to you. if my opinion is irrelevant why reply  thats a odd action for something that is irrelevant. your actions are just as predictable  if I reply youreply back.
@metal melee  I can have the opinion the show is bad just as you can have the opinion its good. if you think its so wonderful why not go somewhere that other people are praising it.  youre complaining people are criticizing the show because you like it. you say because I dont like the show its not an honest opinion. so if everyone doesnt agree with you its not honest and its spreading fire  you complain about me spreading negativity when you came to someone s channel to do exactly that about them and other people who have a similar opinion as the content creator of the channel. your logic is so messed up. just comes to terms with people having genuine problems with the show doesnt mean you cant like it. go ahead and like the show no one is stopping  you man but dont complain when people dont like the show. constructive criticism is how shows and products improve.
@metal melee  warrior for justice  because I agree a show is not good and give why I dont think its good. that makes me high on my horse   using the same logic couldn t I say the same about you for attacking the content creator in the channel  I swear every time you post your arguments apply more to you then anyone. Ive never once said rop shouldn t exist it must go away. Ive just given my opinion on the show and your having a fit over it. everyone has a different opinion. everyone has different interest  likes  and outlooks.
strange. I got a notification that just johnny answered me  but his comments are not visible here.I just see the first lines of the notification below the bell --------------------------------just johnny replied   timemachine194 Im not a writer or a reader I like tv shows like rings of power. if your head wasn t so far up your back side then you could enjoy it for what it is a  --------------------------------enjoy it for what it is well  let s say I am a connoisseur and I just consume the best stories.like someone into wines. if you are  a connoisseur in wine  you go for the expensive  really good ones. the supercheap discounter shit that people use to just get boozed in a party cheap will be a disgrace for any expert  and will not give any satisfaction.yes  you can drink supercheap  bad wine made of bad  sour grapes  but its a waste of money and time. I am just consuming the good stuff  not the cheap  inconsistant  makes no sense stories by bad writers. watching this is a waste of time.amazon had the chance. they used excellent quality sources  fantastic writing and a carfully crafted world and paid a lot of money for it only to write crap and ignore it. like mixing a  2000wine with the cheapest 5l-bet-drunk-wine right from the junkjard.I actually consider what they do as vandalism on tolkiens work.
rofl!!!!
we all need therapy after that!
lol
this!
yes! wholeheartedly agree. there are some channels that I respect and enjoy thatseem to take a third of the video to properly dig in to the topic.
thank you so much! I have made a conscious effort to dive into the point of the video right away as I have had problems with rambling first in the past  so it means a lot to see this recognized
it really is refreshing and as a person who cant stay focused very long especially with social commentary videos. I stay engaged much longer when the speaker gets to points quickly from the beginning. if I see them dancing around for too long even a minute I will probably start looking at the videos recommendations and if my gaze is caught by another shiny topic on another channel I will click away fast.  whatever she s doing she s keeping my attention longer than many channels
do you also appreciate how she emobdies colonialism  genocide and white imperialism by being a Christian fundie do you also appreciate how she pushes dangerous narratives about vaccines which has led to the re-emergence of once eradicated diseases like measles
@dragon ball fans cant read  golly  all that and a youtube channel  where does she find the time to keep her hair looking so nice
@afterwit  oh dear  trying to be clever with sarcasm.
@dragon ball fans cant read  guilty on the sarcasm front  but I dont think Im being very clever. but seriously  your list is just too much. too over the top to be taken all thatseriously.also   fundie   insults simply cant change minds  they only serve to encourage the people who already agree with you.
@afterwit  its not over the top.
@melonie mac go boom  btw  love seeing you on fnt!
bingo my guy
yeah the guy made no good point there he just cried and called her a moron. melanie doesnt need to apologise for presenting him in a way that he didn t like. he made himself look bad without melonie a help
agreed.  jaffe needs to stick to just making games and quit with the white knight virtue signalling.
I agree with blueshell 100 . everything about his videos show that he is emotionally invested in some  issue  and when you point out flaws in the logic  he responds as if it is a personal attack. that isnt something you need to worry about - let him take his own advice  and deal with his own issues. the original comment  his first video  suggests that it is intrinsically misogynistic for a male to criticise a female-led show. he also seems to imply that if a female were to criticise a female-led show  that would be ok. hello! that is the very definition of sexism. if my sex determines whether or not my opinion has any validity . . . . well . . . I think we can all do the logical proof. thatsort of thinking can only exist in a world where sexism is baked into the atomic structure.so yeah ... what he said was totally ridiculous and you have no reason to apologise for calling it ridiculous.
since we are on the subject  @melaniemacgoboom  im curious to hear your take on a mystery of the english language a man who hates is cruel to women is called  misogynistic . but what do you call a woman who hates is cruel to men if you hate other men you can be called  misanthropic   but misanthropic refers to any human who hates other humans  regardless of sex. so why does the english language lack a word that refers specifically to a woman who hates men
@k matsu  the word youre looking for is  misandry
@the rev  pretty sure that a man can also be a misandrist. in fact back in the day  there were people who said that gender reassignment  at least in the case of m-- f  was misandristic.
@k matsu  and a woman can be a misogynist.
the most funny thing about this fight scene is that was made to show how badass galadriel was...against 5 teens who probably never held a sword before !!!
oh thank Christ. Ive been looking for a womans perspective on this travesty. thanks for your input  subbed.
a significant portion of the budget must have gone to media outlets for buzz  positive articles  and exposure  just to get people talking about it  along with favorable reviews from critics.
I am completely convinced there is a huge money laundering scheme behind this show!! there s just no possible way this series cost a billion dollars
jaffe only made a response in the first place because youre female  he often makes ignorant blanket statements when it comes to woke talking points  you weren t wrong people like him need to hear that criticism.
the show might suck  but the memes are a gift that just keeps on giving.
maybe it isn t a  1 billion production and they re saying that to get people to watch it. itseems like its all just for propaganda and if itshows failing they need to be upfront with it instead of just lying about it. I spoke to somebody who actually had given his show a chance and he said its nothing to write home about. he was being a bit dramatic in his video to be honest  dont worry about them. you have a voice and thats all that matters  keep it up.
if rings of power is a love letter to tolkien I think j.r.r. tolkien just went and got a restraining order against amazon.
by the way  you did incredible to stand your ground   much love to you  melonie mac - go boom!
I think I know what happened here  the first rehearsal accidentally got spliced into the the final cut.
man  that fight scene looked straight out of some community theater musical.
weird to say but please continue to suffer.   I love your reactions
this is a love letter to tolkien  if tolkien were in an abusive relationship where his wife wouldn t let him hang out with his friends ever and had the password to his phone and checked it constantly while berating him for having any opinion of his own and  when losing an argument  would threaten to either call the police and accuse him of domestic violence or threaten to kill herself. you know  that kind of love.on the other hand  that fight scene does show us why she drops the sword and goes with magic
they blew most of the budget on hiring diversity and inclusion coordinators.
watching shad have an aneurysm over the fight scene was absolutely hilarious! this is a thing   -
that fight scene was like college film students trying to recreate the tower of joy fight in game of thrones.
I wonder whether the writers keep forgetting that galadriel is an elf as she keeps coming across as a pissed off human
amazon appears to have gone into damage control mode  by announcing a second amazon prime day sale this year
you didn t do anything wrong. the God of war director is completely out of his mind.
as a military brat  I bet her  training  must seem like absolute basic training 101.  to kill an orc  you have to stab it
the only ads I ever saw on this was on it being 1b. just found out it was out a week ago
paying fake   superfans  to gush over the trailer   I can fix him    lame
Ive heard itsaid that the billion dollar budget is actually a sham figure - intended to be a rough estimate for five seasons worth of this tripe.so in reality this first season is more like  200 million at most - even then itstill looks laughably cheap compared to westworld season 1 which had longer episodes and better quality while costing half as much.
it mostly went into the pockets of the 20  producers listed in the credits for the show  the rest is all cgI budget.
I went too hard on him personally though which goes against my own values  I felt guilty after uploading it and I should have focused on the talking points instead of judging him personally. but we resolved everything and all is good now so all is well that ends well
@melonie mac go boom  at the same time  he is soft to say that you attacked him  which you were harsh  but thats about it  and doesnt know what its like to be attacked all the time and have no help at all. Imyself think independently and I listen more than I speak and when I do speak  deep down I am always anticipating an attack of some kind. I remember when I felt like an outcast in one of your platforms where that happened so much that I carelessly took it out on you once. something I still beat myself over and over for.jaffe directs a project and makes on bad goof at one time or another  gets  attacked  and has a menagerie of people to be there  on his channel.I just state something at times that are just facts  I get attacked and I suffer in silence alone or if I speak on what it is  people make itsound  trivial . I even get attacked in one way or another on my own channel.jaffe and I are not the same.
@melonie mac go boom  I respect your class but frankly the level of disrespect he expressed originally and in response to you directly shouldn t earn him any consideration. I dont think the normalization of toxic behavior that always comes along with those woke  opinions  is actually beside the point  I think its highly relevant to whether or not someone s  concerns  over toxicity are genuine and credible or hypocritical virtue signaling. if he were actually worried about toxicity and misogyny  would he be insulting your intelligence in response  we all know the answer. my 2c  keep keeping it real.
to be clear I dont think jaffe is a bad guy  he s just one of those aging well-meaning progressives who doesnt hear himself sometimes when repeating tribal  knowledge . there are few human beings capable of articulating that kind of criticism competently in a way those types of people are able to hear due to how they already view things  so its appreciated.
the memes will outlast the properties
and if it is actually  1 billion  the shareholders better start asking where all the money went.  because it certainly didnt show up on screen.
@tippyc2  agreed. something shady is going on here  and it make me wonder if politics are involved.
thats what it looks like lol!
bahahaha!!!
ooh  Imust look for that. I wonder if scholagladatoria will analyse it too.
I love his rants
waiting for a miss miyagI dwarf to show up and tell her to wax on wax off
its like calling someone who knows how to flick off a safety and aim a gun an operator.
great job as always melonie. I dont really engross myself in nerd culture  fantasy  etc since it all went woke like I used to  but watching content from you and others gives me a peek at what is going on in the nerd realm  without having to subject myself to it
what did it for me is when galadriel s angry she does this upper-lip nose twitch thing that our class pet rat did in 2nd grade.
I came for the rop rip but I stayed for the drama. good for you  you handled that well.
the only thing which can wipe the  condesending b..ch  expression off galadrrriel s face is learning that halbrand is sauron. I am really looking forward to that moment.
you dont actually think they spend  20 000 on a hammer   30 000 on a toilet seat  do you   julius levinson.   500 000 for diversity specialists and  1 million for lore demolition.  me.
peter jackson hired the late bob anderson as fight choreographer for his trilogy  who was a veteran stunt coordinator  swordmaster   former fencing champion. the guy worked on countless legendary movies  like the star wars ot  highlander  princess bride  the antonio banderas zorro movies  the pirates of the caribbean movies etc. etc. he trained all the actors for several weeks and stated later in interviews how much work viggo mortensen  sean bean   the rest of the cast put into their training.well  one thing is for certain  they didn t put much work here on this show.... bob anderson passed away in 2012  rip.
thats hilarious the britney spears music. wow and the copy paste and its so obvious too. its so sad that they think this is good. I think tolkien would have absolutely hate this if he were still alive. he responded to your video  thats interesting. but I dont think you said anything wrong. another great video melonie. have a good day
the part where they photoshopped a crowd of people using the same 5 people was pretty impressive. I know because I use photoshop and thatscene would have taken me at least 20 minutes to create. well done  amazon. money well spent.
now that I think about it  shad  shadiversity  was actually helping direct a short movie based on one of his books. anyone heard anything about that
galadriel   there is a tempest in me! doctor   you need an immodium or dulcolax! audience   the bathroom is over there!
I just noticed that you have almost 50k subs now melonie! it was only a couple weeks ago you hit 40k. I know you put a lot of work in and youreally deserve this
I find the whole bully elves thing to be kinda untolkien. I figured the elves would be like the vulcans from star trek they d be above that even as children at least with each other. yeah elves is lotr were emotional but only in high tension moments.
guyladriel literally fights like she has wooden sword and their was made out of foam  peak definition of  I think I know how to fight with swords  when never holding real one in life
all of this recent talk about lotr made me want to see it...so I just finished rewatching jackson s timeless trilogy with my family  what a great time!
Im starting to believe simon tolkien is intentionally trying to torch his grandfather s and father s legacy
that parry at 1 36 is how you lose the use of an arm. there is no way to control the enemies sword with that move  and therefore the enemy controls your blade  which they will use the bind to cut deep into your bicep and brachialis. as to the copy paste they do that way to much  along with looping cgI  it was what killed wheel of time for me in the first episode.
plus I love how youreact to these things. sorry youput yourself through it. but thank you.
I will never forget her face when she flips backwards.  it will be in my nightmares till the end of my days...
discount awen  with an attitude problem  -     hit the nail on the head. they could have promoted her role in a more majestic way instead they made her look bitchy.
I love the Lord of the rings movies  especially the book even more. I was very skeptical of the amazon series  as I was concerned with the approach they would take  especially after watching how they butchered the wheel of time series. I was hoping for so much better.... I barely could make it through the 1st episode. definitely not what I was inwardly hoping for.
I would say its not all bad  and I still believe that to an extent  but its going downhill for sure
@timothy cannon  well if you dont mind sifting through all the bs then Im sure there is still plenty of great content to enjoy. more power to you if you still get something out of it. Im certainly not judging.  for me personally  I was super burnt out  and just sick of it. maybe I ll dip my toes in again one day. but for now I ll just check out what s going on from afar. I was raised on video games  anime  etc  so Im sure I wont stay away forever. just crossing my fingers that all this woke stuff is just a super long trend that will pass.
she really is aa bad actor that has no passion to dleibver the best she could and work for it. this looks like 0 training  nothing.just to compare  to get kill bills sword fights as awesome as they are  this is what they went through to deliver fantastic acting ---------------------------------------------------------- the training itself was brutal   wrote fox.  we d do fight choreography  knife throwing  samuraI lessons and hit the treadmill and weights in between. they liked me because I could do them high kicks from being a cheerleader. although fox had just one fight scene  her training regime was intense. after the bride regains consciousness following a four-year coma  she decides to track down her fellow assassins to get her revenge. the fight with vernita green  vivica a. fox  is the first we see on screen. to prepare for that brutal showdown  fox was put through the wringer. she recounted   for three months  uma thurman  lucy liu  daryl hannah  david carradine  and I spent eight hours a day studying martial arts at a gym they put together in culver city. it was nine to five  monday through friday. if you didn t walk in the door between 8 55 and 8 59  you were in trouble at 9 01. I thought I was in the damn olympics or something. clearly  tarantino pushed his stars as hard as he could to get the most impressive martial arts performances out of them ... but he may have pushed them a bit too hard.----------------------------------------------------------------this scene proofs  that guylandriel had absoluzely none of that. her fighting up to date is ridicculously incapable and amatuerish. because she didn t give a damn to get good at fighting in a role that is basically there to show a feminist agenda on how superpowerful and capable women are.uma thurman and lucy liu proved to be powerful  bad-ass sword fighters  and they sweat for it and delivered. guylandriel clearly didn t. she basically gives the opposit impression those 3rd wave feminist writers wanted her to be.
this is so typical of current genz. they want to be awesome at everything  the best  but they dont want to do anything invest anything in getting good at something. they just want to be  without the passion to become that.and doing that as an actor actress  is basically refusal to work.
elves also aren t super human they dont have ridiculous strength. so a young male could  push his sword through
...but there s a tempest inside of her
the entire pj trilogy had a budget of roughly  500 million  adjusted for inflation   thats all 3 movies only cost  500 million for 9-11 hours of content.the fact that amazon spent double the money for less content and somehow made it a disaster is completely baffling to me.
20 years ago I was much interested and fascinated in how jackson s team made all of this film magic    and I actualy learned a lot about what stands behind true great production. about costumes  design  training of actors  and adapting of books to a script which makes sense    now Im able to watch on yt what does it need to make true trashy production which - Im sure - eventualy will be used as cautionary tale to generations of filmmakers  d
honestly I have so much respect for u and how u responded to that guy  love ur spirit keep being u
discounted eowyn  had me dead laughing
this is a love letter letter to tolkien.  no it was a break up letter.
great take on this travesty. thank you for sharing. Godspeed!
they didn t hire lore masters of tolkien  or kicked them out  they didn t hire hema instructors for sword fighting  they didn t hire good actors to play well roles  they didn t hire good writers or directors  all of them either did nothing or did shitty things   with every episode going in cgI looks worse and worse  to the point that they have to school grade style copy and paste guys in to the background   I am honestly afraid that they paid more than half on marketing and cgI and all they got left were under couch cents to somehow cover it up. this honestly sounds like giving money to shitty  inexperienced  cheap people who had no idea how to properly use them and got shit in their pants when they found out how much it was left.
youre a class act  melonie. dont let them take that from you.
its not even just the bad choreography of the fight scene  its that no one seems to have bothered to rehearse it.
this shows thatsome things cant be solved by simply dumping mad amounts of cash on it
hImelonie thanks always for bringing your opinion on hot topics.as always its great finding out interesting topicsthat others dont check on.takecare melonie
I love your cool analytical and sometimes jovial way you take apart this cultural garbage from hollywood. personally I would be yelling at the screen every time I saw galadriel huff and puff....lol
did the guy claiming everyone is an istaphobe feeeeeeeeel he was unfairly critiqued
no one should ever apologize for a valid critique  they ll just use it against you. I just watched the linked video for the first time and it didn t come across as a personal attack. that tool just reinforced the critique against him with the way he reacted.
my favorite was galadriel telling the recruits to stab orcs to kill them lol. like gee  I never would ve thought to have done that with a sword
it began with the forging of the great films. threads were given by tolkien  immortal  wisest and fairest of all beings. rights were granted to jackson  great miner and craftsman of the mountain of lore. and nine  nine hours were gifted to the race of men  who above all else  desire quality. but they were all of them deceived  for another show was made. in the land of amazon  in the fires of mount prime  the dark Lord bezos forged in secret a master flop. and into this show he poured his money  his greed and his will to dominate all film. one show to ruin them all.
rop  seem less like a love letter to tolkien and more like an obscene phone call with the airing of each additional episode.
2.50 - this piece of horse armor is called browband or headband.    jackson s team in lotr made 200 pieces of it for their horses. these pieces were handmade from leather to assure that their horses are not going to be harmed by plastic things and that these pieces are going to look different becouse they meant to be made by different craft of different tribes.
a love letter to tolkien   more like a middle finger.
luckily for me  I canceled my amazon prime account just before this series dropped.  and from what Im hearing  it is yet another dumpster fire  so thats probably a very good thing   I always tend to listen to the youtubers who actually watch this kind of content and give their honest opinions rather than the shill critics who blindly heap mountains of praise on certain shows and movies just because they dont want to lose their early access to content. another great video!
I liked the part where galadriel cut off the dudes hand and said   I am your rings of power!
once you see it you cant unsee it. team bad reboot. that whole bullying scene is almost exact to the star trek 2009 scene with spock being bullied. it was just revamping old scenes from different project by the same producers.
it makes the throne room fight scene in the last jedI look competent.
I d love to see you medival show that had the guys doing for honor do the choreography. that trailer was so well done and seeing it irl has so much potential
I love how disingenuous and nit picky he is- if it makes you want to facepalm - you can actually facepalm literally too
if I was ceo of amazon I d be like where did the money go bro. its like throwing a sleeping bag and bucket in the back of a beater van and calling it a motorhome
a love letter to tolkien  well I suppose thats right if the letter was a cut up news print blackmail letter threatening to kill his cat. honestly the choreography on this show is on par with xena  or hercules  only they managed to even fu k that up.
money laundering aside  I honestly think over half of the budget went to marketing and with thatsaid  paid social media influence. imagine the movie s  these amounts of money could have made with a proper leadership and vision.
galadriel s swordplay looks like she s flipping pancakes
never apologize it always goes sideways
I like that female content creators are speaking out against this madness
I think it takes alot for youtubers to not be vindictive. this could have easily been more youtuber drama but boom nipped it in the bud and also was fair about saying he can keep his shyt up while she unlisted hers while apologizing. alls fair in love and war.
masterofthetds is great. glad I followed him. saw 2 of my own replies in there too   also  thanks for making me laugh today with the galadriel stuff. the jaffe thing  I tried watching his response  I ended up really not liking him. I am glad you and he are on decent terms though.
the creators seemed to have cashed jeff bezo s check  then blew it all in monte carlo.   while they may not have actually done that  that money doesnt appear to have gone into the show itself.
6 39 I slowed my speed down to normal   turned on the captions.  it was still to low for most of the captions to generate.  the entire scene of her as a child generated no captions   not even generic ones like fighting sounds
never apologize to these people or give them the benefit of the doubt. weakness is blood in the water.
my daughter is trying to get me to watch it. not because she likes it or thinks I will  but because she wants to hear me rip it apart.
I hope the catering is realllllly good!!
so here s our plan... we re gonna make the main character  who has some of the most interesting background material to work with in all of the lore  a charmless  soulless  sociopath. the audience will love it!
at this point  I believe amazon used the budget of this show as a sort of money-laundering scheme.
as far as I know  they have spent around  400m on the first season and close to  1b  so far  on marketing and promotions.well somebody has to delete all those negative reviews.
I dont apologize to the mob  but in this specific case I do think I came on too strong so I have no issue owning up to that
lol some people are desperate to make money so they will troll and follow the wave on anything
its less a  love letter  to tolkien than it is a  dear john letter. edit  and I just realised that tolkien s first name actually is john...
lots of the budget went to sets and costumes. which look great!
its kinda of like wrestling or martial arts in movies tv when one person has to carry everybody else because they re not prepared or they lack the training and experience  but here nobody seems to know how to handle swords or proper combat.
a love letter to tolkien - we hate you with all our passion because we ll never be even 1 10 as good as you are
I am surprised guyladriel only used two swords surely four would have been better using the force whilst on yoda s shoulders
a discount  owyn with an attitude problem  and seeming like she s perpetually on the rag   .. just spat my tea out
hey mel  I always enjoy your videos  and Im so happy to see you doing so well.  you look fantastic and you look like youre doing well for yourself  so that makes me happy.  Im going to keep following your videos for sure.if Im being real honest  I disagree with you on the rings of power.  Ive actually really enjoyed it.  she hulk   Im right there with you.  its embarrassingly bad and plays that woke sh!t real hard.  but rings of power has actually met my expectations and exceeded in some.  I haven t felt the story is  woke  or anything like that  so I d really like you to go further on how they are pushing a woke message  because Im just not hearing it in the story.  you even say they re  rewriting a legacy  which again  I really dont understand.  I expand on this in my final paragraph I understand thatsome people feel the casting may have been  woke  with the black elf and black dwarf  but honestly I put more weight into acting skill over lore visual description accuracy when it comes to performances like this.  and yes  I understand elves are supposed to be very fair skinned  but I also dont think its impossible to consider that elves have procreated with humans  leading to black elves  which btw is exactly what we see him doing  attempting to procreate with a human  .  lol.  and the woman that plays durin s wife  the black dwarf  is absolutely dominating that role in the best way.  nobody could have portrayed that role better than her  and to my knowledge there s nothing saying there aren t black dwarves.note - the horse armor doesnt look 3d printed.  I 3d print stuff  you cantell something that is 3d printed by looking for layer lines  and that isn t it.  so even if it is 3d printed  it was definitely finished well.  and the costumes  in my opinion  have been really good.  even the one example you mention isn t actually that bad.  if I saw someone walking around a cosplay convention in that  I d be stunned.  and let s be real  cosplayers sometimes end up making higher quality costumes than you see in the film when you take away cgI from the films.and yes  if you pause the screen and look carefully  they copy and pasted some people for a crowd.  honestly  go watch the jackson lotr movies and you ll see the exact same thing many many times.  its common practice.  its cheaper to cgI copy characters than it is to hire thousands of extra s.  I didn t even notice it while watching.final and maybe most important point here - galadriel in the jackson films is 5 000 years later.  demi-God like feminine character is the result of her younger years when she developed that character.  how do we expect she would become the wise queen galadriel in the lotr films without going through affliction and adversity   tolkien left a lot of story untold.  his notes on galadriel  at least from what Ive seen  are very vague and skip over hundreds of years at a time.  and its true  the show doesnt stick perfectly to that.  she should be married to celeborn already  but they didn t include that  at least not yet.  there was no adversity in galadriels story  though  so adding in adversity to develop her character isn t  in my personal opinion  unwelcome.  she was a favorite character to a lot of people in the jackson films  so its natural they would want to include her in this since she is alive and would be considered a critical character of the time  I wouldn t call that woke.  and to make an interesting story  you have to actually write a story where there really wasn t any.my honest conclusion  though  is that youre coming up with reasons not to like it  rather than giving it an honest chance.  a lot of what you talk about in other videos is absolutely on point  but you took some woke media hype from 3rd party media  prior to the shows release  and ran with that and made up your mind before you even saw it.  my opinion   go back and watch the original lotr movies  and then immediately follow up with this with a clear mind  and you might enjoy it.  I certainly have.    I hope to hear from you  and of course two two two - best in blue.   that one is just for you and i
a  love letter  to tolkien that became a  blackmail letter  or a  friendzone response letter ...
again  evil cannot create and it can only destroy and ruin what good have created as tolkien said himself.
and thats how a humble person acts they admit their wrongful doing and they make amends which is how we are all supposed to be
youre a class act melonie.
that jaffe was pretty cringe ngl. he was dripping anxiety knowing that he had to walk on eggshells since you were a woman and he was a high risk to  say something cancelable .
stumbled upon your channel. not bad. I think I ll check out more
this is a love letter to tolkien  the kind you find slipet under your door in cut out newspaper letters from a stalker.
love letter! !....oookay  gonna be a swipe left on this one.
amazon   oh  you didn t like  the hobbit   well you ll be begging for when we re done.
there is this constant idea of giving characters bad backgrounds or difficult childhoods... galadriel already had it in her background  the kingslaying of aqualond . she didn t participate  but it was a horrible event thatscarred many elves. no need to add  difficult childhood  to the character. happened to star trek characters as well in nutrek.
I am glad that I am not the only one who thought this show kinda sucked! I love that you are willing to call it as it is!
thats what ive been asking myself since I heard about this multiple photoshopped people scene!!!!!!!65 million dollars per episode! !  seriously! !
this is a twisted perversion of tolkien s work
cough cough iron first cough cough
lol bots
@jacqueline folguera  what about me makes you think Im a bot   the fact that I said Im happy to see her doing well   thats because I used to work with her so I consider her a friend.
@jacqueline folguera  btw  you have an amazing perspective of what bots can write.  you apparently have really high confidence in aI if you think everything I just wrote was written by a bot.
... Imade a cake  once.
where did the budget go   let s just say this is why you dont distribute budgets in amazon gift cards.
the swordplay in my high school drama class was better than that. are you kidding me  they couldn t hire a real combat coordination team probably because everyone was afraid of bringing too much toxic masculinity into the atmosphere they had to work in every day. I really want to know what they spent the money on now.
their entire budget went to marketing how big their entire budget was
they called it a billion dollar production to create buzz. most of that money went into building their recording studios Im fairly certain.
their vile  message  is lies   hate
Im convinced that this show is a producers scam. thats the only explanation that makes this low-budget nonsense make sense.
galadriel...  discount alien on the rage   thats priceless
Im a relatively new subscriber to your channel. I got to see you on simpcast and it was an excellent chance to see your shining personality in a laid back group discussion. Im a bigger fan for it!
the britney spears had me rolling right away lmao
its not a love letter to tolkien its a threat letter!edit  oh no  its the  metroid dread has bad level design  guy! xd
there s gotta be some money laundering scheme or extortion racket involved in this. for this money they could cast hugo weaving and another top shelf star and talented non rookie writers
I d like to thank amazon for making this series because Im getting so much enjoyment watching it get criticized
God this is like watching drunk toddlers fight.
there needs to be an investigation into money laundering around this show.
lol that limp wrist blocking and hitting away the other swords .
my main problem with the rings of power is it looks terrible in the film quality and just the attention to detail as you pointed out with the 3d printed armor
now all we need to complete the series is a mario brothers legolas a cameo.
Im with you ma lady...3 strikes and they outta here. bilbo said it best  I watched most of the three more than I had liked and I liked less than half of the three more than  they deserved
nobody gets left behind! nobody gets left behind!  except when they do  by us .
paris hiltorc s chihuawarg vs morphine clark fighting.the show is like a mma match of  what will be the worst thing in this
if this is a love letter  I dread to see their idea of hatemail
God I love that they just aired an ad of the show midway of you trashing it
I am asking myself the same question... what did they do with the money
glad I wasn t the only one who had a big problem with how cheap the armor looks.  I had always pictured the numenoreans to be this grand race of men with top notch armor and weapons for their age  almost equal to the quality and grace of elven armory.  yet this show gives us armory that looks like it was picked up at the nearby dollar store.  I cant take the numenoreans as any kind of threat to sauron s power with those.
discount eowyn  that is soooo spot on!
the thing about them copy-pasting and mirroring the extras in thatscene that really bothers me is that you actually can do it well. plenty of movies and shows that have large crowd scenes have done it before. if they did it well  I d be willing to give it a pass given that filming was going on during the pandemic and they had some limits on how many people they could have at any time. I could give it a pass if this was a super low  or even average-budget series. it was just so freaking blatant though. they didn t even have the extras change outfits  hairstyles  etc. to make it more subtle and provide a little variety. they just took the exact same people in the exact same outfits and hit copy-paste  occasionally mirroring them. I really think boasting so much about their budget and how expensive the series was might have been one of their worst mistakes  keyword being  might   what with how many I think they made . shoving the budget in everyone s faces made it inevitable that people would not only be pointing issues like this out  but would almost certainly be far  far harsher on it than the might be on a series with a smaller budget.
they should have used daniel wu s  into the badlands  stunt choreography team.
they spent it all on things like intimacy coordinators
you have a great announcer radio voice
what got me about the practice fight scene was  if she had got it wrong  one time  she would have got her head cut off or something. was stupid.
david jaffe really turned out to be a winner  didn t he  o.o
the budget into the mines of moria  the show into heresy m lady   auta I l me!  and  aur  entuluva!  on september 3rd  the tolkien phandom awoke and found half of the tolkien-verse under the dominion of the corporate machine theyocracy. thus we bring  council in these dark times    exsurge tolkien  our current channel s counter series. it is now beyond a doubt that the Lord of the rings  rings of power  is independent of tolkien and his world s orthodoxy. rop is the second of four heresies  a schism that will leave a forever rift between the phandom and wrought confusion for years to come.
that fight scene reminded me of those martial arts movies when they sttarted using the slow motion effect
ok so the rings of power bandaid has thoroughly been ripped off by now  and if it actually goes on beyond season 2 there is no justice in the universe...what worries me now is the fact the amazon owns the stargate franchise and plans on doing something with it. and that also scares me...
1 05 ok everyone  get your sword and hobble around like a wounded turkey.
the budget went to the sets  especially construction of the full scale city of numenor  which will be used in all seasons  then there s the dwarve sets etc. in pj s lotr  the full scale sets took 1 3 of the budget
you can actually see the texture of the fake swords. its shocking what people with billions do these days. crazy times  crazy times...
the expanse   passion project  where rop s money should have gone.
season ends with mordor being created  the sword is the key to making mt. doom erupt  generic elf villain will do it to block out the sun for the orcs. there will be a battle but I think it goes wrong and they lose  then the next season galadriel is tricked into creating the rings to fight sauron and it will end up giving the power to sauron and that will be her  character arc . judging by pacing  all of season 2 will be about creating the rings and probably will get made at the end of the season
critical drinker s ominous voice  the message
day shall come again.....
@dwayne stach  when an hour of woke and tattered pages come crashing down  but it is not this time  this time the phans of tolkien stand!
with what s recently come out about bad robot being cut out of wb and paramount work I dare say most of the rop budget was laundered by these 2 jj cronies back to their master.
did they get the choreographer responsible for that embarrassing fight at the end of serenity to do that
exactly  where did the money go  they have 55 million an episode! jackson had 100 million per movie and just look at the craftsmanship of the armor  weapons  woodworking  and clothing.
they spent more money on fighting lotr fans than the actual show
when I see galandriel do bossgirl things  I dub thee ser mary  of the sue
if youre tossing around a b  you d think you d goto japan or china and pick up one of their sword choreographer troops. like  they are literally a dime a dozen over there and all of them could have shat out a better scene than that.
the aftermath has been a mighty chuckle! xd
so after complaining about being taken out of context  he picks apart every inch of your video and thus inevitably takes you out of context for the sake of dunking on you in an attempt to save face.
rings of power so much talking  but nothing is said. was looking forward to this series  very sad.
melonie   never apologized to the twitter wierdos   they will smell blood in the water .
galadriel would never used swords but magic  plus if anyone slapped her on the  south side  with the sword it would instant be  sexual abuse
you made it through three  thats impressive. I was done after the first two lol
love your channel lady.
great to see a woman not just giving into the whole  girl power  crap and viewing this show for what it is.. a train wreck. keep being real!
I think amazon is saying they spend that much but in reality is used for tax avoiding
I think the problem is that hollywood became too corporate. they re so focused on pleasing everyone  they please no one. when I see content thatsucks this bad  its showing that the people behind the scenes dont care about the product. when people love what they do  the talent just naturally shows.
a billion dollars couldn t buy actors that could professionally pretend to like being on the same set as galadriel.
cough money laundering cough . subbed and liked.
if you ever feel worthless  there is still surfnboy
I gave up mid way through episode 5 and I should ve stopped sooner. lol
lotr fans  where
wow ad hominem bot statement can be used for anything lol
at this point its either money laundering or tax breaks ... this level of incompetence is definitely intentional
I wish they d give the funding to the people who made arcane and let them keep doing their thing and making series s about league of legends lore.
maybe sauron wasnt the bad guy. he saw what a woke fest it was and did everything in his power to end the madness.
only a few episodes left til  the season finale
this was not a love letter to tolkien but an assassination
I have no idea how did I stop here in this channel  .but I need to confess   I loveeee it
the really sad thing is that the dual sword-wielding  taking on multiple guys at once thing was done much better in got years ago.  ya ll remember the  tower of joy  fight   and how op ser arthur dayne was   the fight choreography was much better and ser arthur had to work hard to fend off 4-5 guys at once.  itshowed his skill but also how much effort  footwork  and concentration it takes to do that.  making this look effortless for galadriel also makes it boring for the audience.  if youre always the best at everything without having to try  why should the audience care   they still haven t learned this simple fact.
there was a team thatspent an entire year putting together chain link armour for the original lotr trilogy. rings of power is embarrassing.
you think for how much money went into this they could easily afford an decent enough action director or choreographer but I digress. the fight scene would more excusable in a lesser show but on expensive production since this is indeed quite a fumble. we all know were the money went with this but it is important to know that just because more money is throw at something doesnt mean it would great. at the end of the day  effort and talent will make or break a production.
tolkien is turning in his grave  - elon musk and anyone that has at least more than 2 neurons working
my hair is almost as long as hers and these men are so inept they didn t use it against her.  that ridiculous back bend was a missed opportunity.   her hair would have been on the ground and one of them should  have stepped on it.   she s not going anywhere if someone is standing on hair.now that I think about it those ridiculous dumb writers would have just had her chop it off to get free.lmao @ discount eowynn.
this isn t a love letter to tolkien. its more like an angry letter asking for overdue alimony money.
rings of power released their show on a wrong timing. they went head to head with another fantasy series house of dragons.
you canthank the horrible choreography on clark I believe she said she was getting ptsd from the fight scenes.
david jaffe   no  I do mind... ehh the dude minds... this will not stand  ya know... this aggression will not stand  man...
honestly video game storylines have gotten good enough to make a killing in movie or show adaptations if done right. God of war  even horizon zero dawn. although they hate red heads  so it d probably get race swapped on that front.
the rop showrunners have written a dear john letter to tolkien s legacy
guess the budget will go in legal suits...or maybe the had the fanciest catering ever for this remarkable cast
and now I have britney spears stuck in my head. oh well  I guess its better than the super mario theme.
yeah  thatsword fight was terrible. she was told to train them and she didn t teach them anything but stab and twist and move your feet. they all just piled on and she fought them off. how did that train them
this is rough...damn amazon. good job melanie  I liked you on fnt
writers   dear tolkien  you were a moron who had everything wrong. we will use our superior intellect to correct your blatant mistakes. idiot. fans   wtf  these morons are insulting tolkien  hastily issued missplanation from amazon   no  no fans  you ve got it all wrong. this is actually a love letter to tolkien. fans   facepalm
looking at the current trends of continuous flop  cheap big banner tv series and movies... its looking like they have more benifits making this type of content... there s definitely some catch here... I think it is not about the quality  but about how much engagement you get on sm negative or positive doesnt matter... more engagement  more money...  negative get more engagement I guess.
thanks for the very honest commentary. from a young women s perspective - do you like this  kick ass  woman elven princess taking on and defeating 4 men in a wood  sword fight  jrr tolkien never had this  though he did have the one riders of rohan woman disguise herself as a man and she killed one of the witch king wraiths that could never be killed by a man. she took off her helmet and informed the soon to be dead wraith witch king  I am no man  - I thought that was ok  but thats about enough feminist  take charge fighting gal stuff I cantake in a 9 hour movie series. ha ha - what s a women s perspective on this
ngl  imma finish the first season of rop.  masochism runs deep in my family
1 32 yeah she just lost her arm there. no one can make a behind the arm wrist block  that will stop a full sword slash
if I were the government... I d be looking at this show and asking myself  60 million dollars an episode   where does all the money go   maybe I should look into this and see if there is some sort of money laundering going on!
a significant portion of the budget went to brett favre
discount  owyn - 5 stars... accurate af
I get where the gow guy is coming from as he s right in that the hate isn t equally spread around. I think the reason is a result of the promotion media coverage. my nerd geek friends love hod and the queen s gambit which are big storywise on women overcoming obstacles largely due to them simply being women. the difference between these lauded shows and hated shows  besides quality lol  is the mainstream media isn t plugging them for  woke  reasons to the same extent as these mcu properties. I didn t see any article saying if you hated queen s gambit then youre an ist  maybe they exist but not to a large extent from major publications . so yes  there is heavy pre and post- hate to these propeties as a counterbalance to the heavy pre- and post- love to the same properties. sandman has major representation for lgqbtq but search for articles and you ll find almost nothing for it  whether pro or con  and the show has way more viewers than she hulk. the show runners set out to make a good show with a diverse cast but didn t feel the need to advertise the diversity to the world  which ultimately cheapens it. in order to dissipate the predisposed  immense hatred for properties by fans based on  wokeness   we first need to dissipate the predisposed  automatic love for properties by critics mainstream media based on  wokeness .
the action scenes are good  if they were to a musical
youre such a classy lady! luv it
you dont owe jaffe an apology at all
im holding out on a slight hope for a worthy prequel  not done by amazon or netflix  thatstays true to tolkien. its really a pity this turned out so terribly  with all the money poured in and hype. however it looks like a bunch of corporate tools did what they do best  especially with the rumours about firing a tolkien scholar  not super surprising. the whole show has the quality and depth of a video game cutscene..except its hours long and puts you to sleep.
I actually I really like this show  I dont know why are people so mad about it
it is a love letter to tolkien  hardcore bdsm love letter.
any time you have an action scene fight scene that has more hard  abrupt cuts in camera angles than actual punches  kicks  and clang of swords......it means the choreographer and director are hiding the lead actor s lack of athleticism and or lack of martial arts prowess.this becomes especially apparent when there is a cut angle in the middle of a punch  kick  or sword swing.  it means they spliced together footage from multiple takes and tried to make it look like one attack  one motion.  they aren t fooling anyone.
rings of power is to tolkien what dora the explorer is to jules vernes.they can retcon and rewrite whatever they want  I personally dont recognize it as a legitspinoff so  for once  this poor attempt to spay my childhood doesnt affect me!
honestly girl  you didn t do anything wrong in regards to david gaffe. he clicked on your video 100  ready to dunk on youregardless.
this is a love letter to tolkien... written by a stalker living in your crawlspace!
guess its long overdue to ignore them. while these rants are great to watch for the youtubers  we need to ignore them and let them crash.
what a great gal you are.
I wish peter jackson had some say in this series. it would ve been a bit different.
you seen the cast wages  guyladriel is making less than half of them! like 20-25k an episode.
what made the lotr trilogy something extremely special and rare is that it was an epic trilogy made by super fans of tolkien. although not perfect  the flaws can be overlooked because the sheer amount of detail went into every aspect of the production. remember they were also working with a fraction of the budget rop has. rop is the exact opposite. it was a show made by people who either didn t know about tolkien s work  or had an active hate boner for it  feeling they know better than tolkien and need to alter his story and world. pretty much the showrunners are sauron  and bezos is morgoth. they cannot create nor adapt  only corrupt. also Im  sure that this whole rop has been a cover some sort of money laundering scheme being pulled off by amazon.
6 06 - nice summary of this character!!
I think dual of the fates would be equally as funny as britney spears.
the fight choreographer must be the same one that did the last jedi.
he actually was making fun of it and you handled it like a champion and one of God s children.
my buddy literally just sent me this fight scene before I watched your video. its beyond bad. its borderline satire   like I could totally envision a scene like this in one of those over-the-top comedies like naked gun.
love letter to tolkien  who wrote the letter  michael j. fox
I barely made it through the first episode.  three  you win.
its like ribbon dancing with swords
thank you for watching this dumpster fire to report on itso the rest of us tolkien fans didn t have to. the trailers were enough to convince me that this thing was going to be a shitshow of epic proportions.
its a creepy stalker letter to tolkien  written by stunted people who dont quite understand others.
the ones who still watching just cant get enough pain
if they had kept galadriel a kind hearted magic user this would be way better.
wait until you have a good story and people that are passionate about it before you throw money at a show movie. amazon worked backwards on rop.  cant buy me love.
paid close attention to her wrists on that fight sequence.... pain
do actors get 2x the pay when they appear 2x in the same shot
are her enemys in the fight scene ex stormtroopers

stevie wonder
all went into the graphics just like today s video games.
likely a great embezzlement before they fold.
ayooo discount eowen xd giiiurl eowen was amazing. this rop fake bs galadriel cant even ties the shoes of eowen. that badass waifu went to war  slew a nazgul  and dueled the witch king of angmar the deadliest servant of sauron. and with some help of merry shanked it.
they actually called this a love letter to tolkien   then why does everything around this show seem more like hate-f   ing tolkien
gotta wonder where all that money is really going
kudos on your apology. you have class. that guy is a doooosh.
compare this fight scene to the final fight sequence in the very first episode of the witcher.
the rings of power is one of the most beautiful tv shows ever made. not sure why people hating itso much... maybe they hate jeffy  maybe they hate black elves  maybe they hate strong women  despite she is an elf  or maybe its just somebody somewhere in the world has the power to conjure up thousands of chatbots. well the last part is def true but why
producers get a cut of the total budget. which is to say  they can buy things for the show and keep them. how many producers are on the show listing  add  2 for the show runners. I bet they have bought all kinds of things with jeff s billion dollars.plus  if these jackals have run this show like amazon s wheel of time  then all kinds of friends and boyfriends  and family got paid for various work.
I am so discouraged for our future.
it just shows this whole woke environment is making us weak  we need to second guess every decision we make... peter jackson did a great job with the original lotr-trilogy  but I doubt it would fly in this era. how times have changed...  for the worst
I think a lot of the money went into bad robot company.
I dont think you need to apologise about the gow director because its not like the guy made any effort to act in a way that contended your thumbnail or portrayal. he made no point and wasn t mis represented by you  he made himself look bad with his only argument being  omg she actually did the face palm  what a moron  also  no point apologising to someone who agreed with their chat member who said  these people think its woke just to defend women  which is a complete lie and strawman.
so this is what you get for 60 million an episode huh
the britney song was a nice touch
it is a brilliant project with great visuals. it is objective. plus - its funny how people miss the x-ray feature on the desktop version which shows up at the top left corner of the screen when you move your mouse or pause the video. every single detail and the reference sources  which book  which part etc  are given there.
maybe galadriel is a masochist so it was bliss to her
Ive only seen the random clips from this show. but that fight scene is vomit inducing. again  mage... galadriel is supposed to be a mage!
yes the galadriel sword fight was kind of corny...but it was just one scene...the rest of the show has been good @meloniemac
melonie mac makes me go boom in the pants  p....great video mel
well Im glad someone thinks so  because the three episodes I watched were like pulling teeth to get through lol
@melonie mac go boom  what did you not like about it  did you think it was boring  I dont get the hate...alot of channels have been hating on this since b4 the show came out..its not rated r like got but Ive thought it has been entertaining...the characters r being set up
anyone else dying to see shadiversity break down that fight scene in the fight scene autopsy series  watching him break down the throne room scene was blissful  and he has said he plans on breaking it down.
amazon ordered this series on aliexpres.
david   Im not trying to champion women  Im calling out something that is problematic on my own show. champion  verb   to support the cause of  defend.david jaffe cant go ten minutes without being logically inconsistent.
so trop has a sword fight where galadriel  has a sword in each hand.  it had better be good.  its not.   its not like the sword in each hand hasn t before.  for example there are many miyamoto musashImovies  and he was known for his two sword style.  maybe the show runners should have looked at inagakI s samuraI trilogy.  you need female swordsman    cheng peI peI played golden swallow in two shaw bros movies and she fought with two swords.  that was in the 1960 s.  not for nothing but  segawa masahito shot a better fight scene with masakI ran in bikyoshI jigokuzeme but the weapon of choice was a kendo pole  not a sword.
itsupposed to be a billion dollar show and it looks like its worth a few million bucks. even the special effects feel like a budget cut there
I think it was made from the start to fail  so they can detract from taxes. then  claiming more than the real expense would make sense.
thats guyladriel from the rangz of woke all right.
geeks with lightsabers on youtube make better choreographed showings then Lord of the rings rings of power
personally I dont mind the swordfighting scene. Ive seen more ludicrous things and enjoyed it. even if it was not made in an ironic manner. the reason why I cant bash them too much on that is because then I would have to be objective and say that many other things are just bullshit. however what makes me feel able to say that it is extremely bad here is that it is just something that ads to her mary sue status  even though technically galadriel would not be one  she has been taught for millennia . the show simply fails to give her those character flaws thatseemingly flawless  well written characters should have. her advanced age would make her less likely to flaunt her powers or skills like that. sure  she would possibly fight someone with a sword and emerge victorious  but like she is doing some form of dance  no. the elves dont fight like that. they are highly structured and very  civilized  in their manner of battle. she enjoys flaunting her powers because the script demands thatshe does. they want  girl power   not  galadriel power . I have sincere doubts that galadriel  already thousands of years of age at this point  would ever act like this. she would be well on her way to be the one we already know.
this looks like they re going through the motion and accidentally recorded it  the finished version was accidentally stolen so they had to do with this cause they ran out of time
your hair looks great! you look great!
2.13 - the only copy-paste of the same actors in the old movies were peter jackson s kids as hobbits in fotr  as rohan kids in ttt and as gondorian kids in rotk  d
I pray bezos audits the spending done on this embarrassing show  I bet short of firing everyone  people might go to jail
well the cgI looks good.I can hurry and wait for the rest.
love letter  more like a dear john letter
mr. bezos we are ready to start production on your masterpiece! we have quality writers lined up  dont we  um  there s a couple of guys hanging out in the lobby...good  hire them  it ll be fine.
6 53that was here joker moment
little known fact since elves live for thousands of years they must have 50 year cycles.
turns out the shills were right. this show is art  at least in the sense that its probably a tax dodge or a front for money laundering.
hey melonie  real talk here.  as a lonely guy  where can I go what can I do to meet more women like you
thats hilarious that director is a tool.
jaffe  or  how to call out perceived misogyny by being actually misogynystic . God of woke  this one.
in the dune movie one character was gender swapped  it was a man in the book but a black woman in the movie  yet nobody complained  why well  first of all  the movie is awesome  the character was well writted and acted  and they never bragged about diversity or anything of that  it was just a minor change.the fans were never called racist or mysoginist  and no matter the change  they were as close to the source material as possible  that happens when the movie is more important than sending  a message
the golden rule is  attack the post  not the poster . everyone should have and express their own ideas. thats how I know when people have lost an argument   is when they start spitting out insults.
if she moves in bed like she moves in the fight scenes...
the whole point is to show what an untimate badass  ubah-chick not-galdriel is.she can kick all man-ass without even being serious.
a short calculation  250 million for the cgI  5 mio for plastic armor and discount costumes  overpriced  5 mio for the cast  740 mio for  spreading the message . thats roundabout 1billion dollars
certainly didn t go to the actors. galadriel - 20k per episode.isildur - 25kdon lemonlas - 15kbronwyn - more than galadrieletc.
where did the budget go  to the executives and actors for their over paid salaries. the leftover peanut cash was what they used for the budget of the show.
a love letter to tolkien.yeah maybe a love letter from a stalker who is off their meds and at the end of their rope who is about to snap because tolkien wont respond to their insane ramblings.
in the Lord of the rings movies  peter jackson cuts a scene where aragorn fights sauron  because he thinks  its not worth it. in this series  they create a scene where galadriel fights theses people only to show how badass she is. what a poor coreography   looks like kindergarten fights
yes rings of power is a dsappointment for everybody.
that type of sword fight is what you see children do while playing make believe. if it was real  galadriel would of been fighting for her life. this is just embarrassing.
he was clearly triggered. and uses buzzwords. its not like youre his superior   unless subconsciously...so he shouldn t have felt a need to respond defend himself  but he wore a cloak of virtue. he had no case  example  argument  just  I c u wimmenz
the whole company  amazon  is toxic  why I never buy or take any services from them. but hey  the good thing it brought us together...... Imean.... I found your channel..... youre nicer to watch then imposter galadriel and I love to see thatshow burn
well maybe if they didn t change everything.  the dwarves dont even have beards.   I know thatseems small to some but its just 1 example.  also if you know lore all dwarves have beards women and men.   in the lotr movie gimilI points that out.  its also mentioned several times in tolkien work.  dwarves are very proud of their beards and would never shave them that would be a shameful act.    none of these videos are talking about dwarf beards but it just shows you how much they changed his work. I could go on about other changes they made to his work but I wouldn t have enough space.
amazon s rings of tax writeoffs
1.05 - Ive noticed that the greatest empire of mortals of 2d age - numenor got recently so much problems with money    that they actualy never finished their garrisons to have a place to train their new warriors    thats why they train them on streets of armenelos - their main city      esp to help with the morale of their ppl where the ppl are able to see - in full glory - this bunch of idiots trained as their main expedition army    d but if these are actual streets why there is a stand rack for swords just out on a street   what is that a rental of swords    d Imean if those recruits were meant to train there they would just got their own swords with them all around - esp becouse their swords are not for training but actual swords itseems - so these are their swords. so they just have their own swords on their belts. but what are those swords on the rack stand there on the left of the street   if someone went to storage rooms and brought a pile of wooden train swords this rack could be used for them ok. but why a rack of real swords on the street
re  the fight scenes. its an understatement to say that they are over-choreographed. actually  the thing that makes the fights in jackson s lotr films is that they are brutal and chaotic. not to the level of  say  braveheart  but a lot closer to that than this dreck.
aww c mon mel  you should know by now that  the she is always right!
morfydd clark who plays the woeful galadriel got paid just  20k per episode! even amazon knew she wasn t worth much!
I saw one clip of the show. it was where some dude stuck out a sword and supergirl ran up it and jet-packed into a giant troll with the one-shot. looked fkn ridiculous. that was enough for me
I think some of the costume gripes are nitpicking  but as someone who once choreographed a fight scene  that was pretty bad
a axon   we should consult with a grievance group to find out what we need to be inclusive and diverse grievance group   hire black people. that be 990 million  thank you.
we ve written a loveletter dear john letter to tolkien
I yawned my way through the first two episodes  but I cant bring myself to watch any more of it. I know a lot of people are upset about the faithfulness of the adaptation  but I couldn t care less about that part. I think if a film maker cant stoke at least a minimum amount of interest with two hours of a show... its a fail.
1 billion could have damn near eliminated starvation in america  but instead we got  yeah
fight sceene right out of buffy!
when I saw 3 numenorian soldiers beaten like a bag of chumps  and all of them looking just... normal... and not the mythical men they were supposed to be.... I was already checking out... its almost walk away worthy that people in the city didn t recognize galadriel despite the city having numerous statues  including what should at least be 2 statues of her in prominent places.I realize they only have limited access to things due to not having the rights to the silmarilion but it just... hurt....as a lifelong tolkienite this just reminds me of when mtv tried to do the shannara series and botched itso hard....
no way did they spend a billion dollars.
hImelonie  I just recently came across your channel and subscribed. I just want to say that Im glad I found it and I really appreciate that youre just being yourself and love how you openly share your faith while discussing topics that interest you. Im not particularly religious but I really enjoy hearing people express how they feel in an honest way and Ive always been interested in other people s religious beliefs. I think if more people listened and respected learned from people of different faiths rather than attacking them on sight then we could all find some form of common understanding as human beings.
that  fight  scene was so much worse that I even imagined from the descriptions. looks more like a broadway show.
the only way I have managed to get through the three episodes is to pretend like it is not something thats supposed to be pulled from tolkien s works. I understand that they were only allowed access to some of the material but thatsaid they could have done a much better job than what they have. so far as galadriel is concerned itseems like the actors is trying to portray the intensity of the character but completely fails and only comes across as bitchy  narcissistic  self-absorbed  and completely off the charts obsessed. agreed that the costumes are absolutely horrible and the scripts they re working from just dont cut it.
just rewatch  battle of bastards  one of the most costly episode from game of thrones  around 10m    and tell me that amazon really got way more money to do this abomination. I just dont believe it.
the choreography looks like a broadway musical.
a  lover letter to tolkien . right. dear amazon     were I to assume there was any sense of genuine affection towards either myself or my works  which upon witnessing the utter dismantling of that which I have slaved over for the sake of england and her people  I would staunchly reject such affections regardless. furthermore  it is both a disturbing  as well as a heart breaking thing to see the inclusion of those peoples for whom my works do not  and were never meant to represent  all out of spite for those whose representation was my sole intent. most insulting of all is to have the absolute gall to not only cut down the meaning behind my works  as the orcs of isengard so eagerly burned the forest of fangorn and quite similarly upon their master s bidding Imight add  but in addition to say that it is to honor myself. you are as dishonorable as even the lowest goblin crawling in the blackened burrows of the deepest pits of moria  but please do take comfort in knowing that there is at least one creature set upon middle-earth and her peoples to whom you can most assuredly relate to.- sincerely  j.r.r. tolkien  or something like that  probably  if he was still alive.
what the hell is even that !
I used to really like elves..they were ethereal   other worldly.. wise beyond words..unfortunately   now I hate elves..go team sauron  goteamsauron
haters still embarrass themselves for clicks.give up. practically everyone is loving the show. you wont kill it from you-tube.
what s really sad is I ordered Lord of the rings a book set with 4 books hobbit included as the 4th and the books fall apart in hand while youread them and its sad they spend billions on a show but shit on tolkiens books and legacy and jeff bezos can go to  space but I cant get books I paid for to not fall apart they are so cheaply made I couldn t believe it
you are right about your criticism of david.  how come the left  which gets pissed off about such generalizations  always makes such generalized attacks
house of the dragon is actually good though.
in the original mythology there were black elves and most dwarves were black. but  that would mean establishing races of black elves and black dwarves which they didn t do here. what they did here was tokenism as they added a black elf  a black hobbit  actually 2 I think  and then you have the black queen over a kingdom where everyone else is white   so tolkiens world might have black races but he was centered on a land where there weren t any much like if you did a show set in europe two thousand years ago and expecting chinese to be there. I only saw the first five episodes and the series seems aimless. more like several series that are being tied together like if you did a show telling the wizard of oz  alice in wonderland and peter pan as you actually can do that based on their similar themes... we just wouldn t want you to do that.
you dont have a fat head sweetie.
anyone who has been friday nights gets my sub.
love letter to tolkien idk it kinda looks like a middle finger to me. just a relatively small  let s say blimp sized  middle finger. maybe a couple of signs here and there. nothing too flashy.
this is supposed to be numenor. a great  proud  strong nation  with a fleet and army powerful enough to challenge the valar  and go on to found arnor and gondor. but  their fleet is made up of  what  3-5 ships..  and their soldiers are some random looking teenagers ....
I do not watch that because the adult make believers attacked us before we saw it and I enjoyed peter jacksons interpretations of tolkien s work and you get thumbs up I enjoy your values and your optimistic views.
just call a spade a spade.
based on his reaction  he may not be championing for anyone in particular  and maybe he s trying to address a problem as he sees it - I dont respect his approach  especially if he has the tendency to speak over others - which I wouldn t put passed him.
when you watch something intending to hate it  you will usually end up hating it. thanks for nothing
Im done with this series.  its shocking that they thought they had an unbridled masterpiece on their hands.  think about how many people at amazon had to of watched season 1 and signed off on it with their stamp of approval.
its the best to see pretty girls tell the truth about this production. I cant wait to find a hot black chick thatsees the light too!
they can make their money back by selling it as a cure for insomnia.
o thought wasting millions on fan fiction was stupid  but mr. bezos seems to enjoy taking thinks to the next level when it comes to money.
this is what she needed therapy for
I particularly liked your take on how cosplayers can do better armors costumes on limited budget. that is because they care a lot for the original character. even if they do a different take on certain characters  like a medieval version of a sci-fI character  or an elegant dress suit based on a pokemon  etc.  some of those talented cosplayers can create masterpieces that is far more respectful to the source material than anything these well-suplied professionals do.suppose that is the difference between a labour of love and plain paid labour. and its why the original Lord of the ring movies looked so awe inspiringly good. because the people at weta loved their jobs  the property  and if you ve seen the making of on the dvd s you know just how much the people involved apreciated them.
sure seems that anything amazon touches turns to woke  so glad the passed  on conan
galadriel she seem much more intimating in the jackson film. so benevolent and powerful.  now she such a try hard Im tough gggrrrrr.
the writers and producers are activists. the money probably went to some alphabet charity.these people hate tolkien so there was no doubt this show was going to suck.
yeah as soon as the fight scene came on I couldn t take it I had to turn it off it was completely unbearable
two words -  budget embezzlement . while large  and I would say inadequate.somehow copies the case with the russian film viking  2016   when for six years they shot a film for 21 million dollars  the most expensive in the history of russian cinema   the result was ugly garbage  and when they began to figure out where the money was spent  it turned out that 70- 90  of the budget went not to the film  but to an unknown direction. I think the situation here is the same.
mel  they pre-emptively called everyone racist for pointing out basic flaws in what little the trailers showed. then the show dropped  and oh baby  baby... its a burned billion.
I called into thatshow lol
this is the kind of stuff we mean when we talk about woke shit ruining the writing of the shows. none of us think that it is a problem to portray middle earth as a place with a lot of female characters in it. but when you decide that one of those female characters simply needs to be on screen kicking the ass of a quintuplet of    warriors  youre gonna get a horribly choreographed fight scene that embarrasses the show  as accommodating stunt man clearly go half-speed so that a 100 pound woman can out duel them with a weapon they ve trained with for years .
I wonder why an anime on netflix made from a game pulls more wives than a billion dollar show.
hey  remember when david was crying about metroid dread being too  hard  so nintendo released a baby mode for him  good times xdalso  its painfully obvious to anyone who knows anything about lotr beyond just the movies that this show absolutely butchered so many characters and stories. cheap sets  bad acting  bad scenes  all ok in my opinion. if their goal  truly  was to honor tolkien  I could over look all that. however  after all they have lied about  how badly they have screwed up the lore and characters  and the absolute disregard and disrespect shown to tolkien s creations  that completely trumps any other short comings they had. they could have had the absolute best everything else  but this utter spitting on tolkien s grave I can never over look. the other lotr films had their own issues  but with the original trilogy  they went out of their way to make sure they kept it as true as possible  while still trying to keep each film not crazy long  and not include any of their own politics or ideologies. this series was not made for tolkien  or those who love his works  it was made for the extremist left wing who know nothing except how to corrupt what is already good.
jaffe is sooooooooooooo desperate for attention. when was the last time you saw a once prominent game dev actually go out of their way to make an unhinged rant against someone  there were also 100s of videos he could have chose from  kinda ironic he went after the woman. by your own words jaffe  be better lmao
probably the most publicized money laundry scheme Ive ever seen. sometimes if you put something in plain sight that is so obvious no one even sees it.
idk dude made a very gamergate flavored koolaid statement and expected applause. I dont find that the people who do thatsort of thing turn out to be good people.
rings of power - what the cw would make if they had the money
rings of power didn t really hurt tolkien s legacy  the hobbit movies did that . the silmarillion is not good  which rings of power is loosely based on . its a series of notes that explain background information about middle earth. its really only for die-hard fans to use as a reference. I found the thing unreadable. the kind of book thats like watching paint dry  and one of my favorite books of all time is the hobbit. tolkien wanted the silmarillion to be a lot like what researching history looks like  with a ton of different accounts of various events. I think its a lot like doing an assignment from history class. I hate it. amazon thought tolkien s version of a history assignment into middle earth would be a fun show for television
the whole show feels like a inside joke.  Im gonna make my own Lord of the rings but with blackjack and hookers . the fact that they even dare consider this as  tolkien  is just dumb and low.
gotta wonder where that one billion dollars went....
after that guys review of metroid dread I cant take anything he says seriously.
in the meantime  go boom
this is a  love letter  to tolkien.  more like a  dear john  letter to tolkien.also  the peter jackson movies cost how much   and they actually hired current day armorers   weaponsmiths to actually create realistic  semi-historically accurate  thematic armor   weapons.   there are full on behind-the-scenes documentaries that cover this. and rop costs how much   and look at the absolute cr@p  they  are wearing   wielding into  battle !
with how bad the stuff looks compared to the astronomical budget  Im 99  convinced at this point this show is a bezos money laundering vehicle.
where tf did the money go !!! something is not right.
the fighting is truly comical.  like the whole series it looks soooooooo terrible.
I couldn t watch through the second episode I walked away from the tv and forgot it was on.
I appreciate a females point of view on this nonsense.
ok so to start you dont train with sharp blades  you use blunted swords or wooden swords   you wouldn t be training in the middle of a market place incase you injure a bystander you would normally have someone instruct you in how to fight   part of learning to fight is getting the moves right but you also have to get used to how your body moves in armour if your using a sword without a shield why wouldn t you take a two handed grip so the weapon is easier to control if guy ladrial only just turned up how the hell did they manage to make a harness to fit her   you dont want badly fitted armour its very sore   in like one day   they couldn t have just had itsitting around as its nothing like any of the numenoreon armours so it had to have been made for her the helmets are terrible as well they sit to high on the head with the cheek pieces restricting your vision clearly the extra cash didn t go into the armour
who doesnt like flexible armour   lmao
galadriel is insufferable but the rest of the show is so good. I dont understand why people are hating on it
2 50 dlc. you forgor to say horse armor dlc.
when someone starts to nitpick on trivial things like facepalming or not  it means they re nervous and feel cornered by your comments. I feel women are so woefully mistreated in modern movies with such sloppy character development and character arcs. its especially annoying when those studios pat themselves on the back when presenting yet another flawless super heroine. wonder woman was one of the best female characters of the big box office movies  she was strong but naive  something anyone can relate to  and yet they brushed it off and later claiming some other movie for having the first female super hero or something. its all about money and pr  they dont actually care about women s causes at all.
the numenorians were the peak of humanity.. like uber men...    and now they re literal goofballs being schooled by guyladriel in the most epic display of cringe ever seen..   just an absolute travesty.
notice how he can attack you ad hominem  call you names and shit. I didn t think you attacked him  but he literally attacked you.never appologize to ideologues  its truly pointless
reduced to eowin  - that is an insult to beloved character and eowin was actually good with a sword compared to regular warriors
I feel like he felt like I was feeling that he felt I felt he was feeling
but melonie you painted him just as he is  a male feminist or an  defender og woman  which he is or want to be with such a blanket statement... but hey thats just my op.
into the badlands had better fight choreography and that was a c-level cable show from 2015.
jeffrey bozos paid 1 billion for the memes
amazon s jeff bezos  approach to tolkien s masterpiece of fantasy was to hire people who had no real love or knowledge of the middle earth lore or canon  glom together pieces of the Lord of the rings  the hobbit and the appendices ignoring timelines and storylines  add made up characters that have no place in the tale and throw a billion dollars worth of cgI at it hoping no one would notice.  when everyone who knew anything about middle earth noticed  the untalented  pc and woke cast and crew went on the offensive deflecting the justified criticism by attacking the fan base as racist  sexist and bigoted.  this was the second clear sign that this project was an abject failure by any standard applied  the first being their own admission that their aim was to  modernize  the tale to appeal to a new audience.  in true hollywood fashion the directors put all of their political baggage and wokeness into a tale about a fantasy pre-history of england that was created by a scholar who devoted a lifetime to develop it in detail greater than any other work of fiction that existed before and certainly since.  it was a disastrous formula from the first day.  add to that the bad casting  high school drama club level writing and dialogue  horribly bad editing  confusing timeline compression  complete mish-mash of character development and utter disregard for the canon and lore and you end up with a show that has cutting edge cgi.......and nothing else worthy of mention.  they would have been better off making this series 100  cgI and saving three quarters of a billion dollars.  trop is absolute garbage from the first episode.  it is not a show that immerses you into the fantasy world of middle earth because the characters are so uninspiring and the pace of the story is boring to the point where you simply dont care what s happening you just want it to keep moving in the hope thatsomething good might be coming.  so far that has not been the case and we re almost to the end of the first season.  this is a clear case of a rich guy thinking his money makes him as much of a literary genius as the true literary genius of tolkien made middle earth.  trop is bezos  ego on full display destroying the greatest fictional literary work of the 20th century through his complete lack of understanding and love for the tales.  the  ner do wells  he hired to help him destroy this masterpiece are all too eager to take his money  stroke his ego and produce a show that has been universally panned by the diehard tolkien fan base.  the reviews have been edited by sites like rotten tomatoes to  adjust the numbers  in favor of the show but cannot explain the cavernous gap between their  tomatometer  rating of 84   383 critics  and the audience score of 38   30 393 users .  rotten tomatoes  and their critic ilk  have lost all credibility here.  they have shown themselves to be little more than amazon shills.  in summation  bezos and his bone-top production cast and crew are a fine example of how money ruins everything it touches.  having money does not make you smarter  more talented or right.  it just makes you a more visible asshat.  they need to cut their losses and do something far less challenging  more in line with their collective lack of talent like commercials for wendy s hamburgers or something.
did they seriously use the britney song during the show
ebru sahin did a better job in her fight scenes in the turkish series destan  compared to whatever this is
its soul crushing to see what the crackpot writers have done to the beloved characters of ltor like galadrial who in the original novels films was the most elegant  gentle   wisest being with the ability to peer into the mind of others and judge them so fairly and the loyalist elfin in middle earth who doesnt need to prove anything. but in rings of flaming garbage her new counter part comes off as an unlikable   agnostic tantrum deficit mansplaining junkie clad in armor. rop isn t tolkien its substandard vomit.
if this galadriel tells the balrog  you shall not pass  the balrog would think  fuck  got to do what she says  sulk and then walk away.
film reviewsits as though they cant get anyone to come up with new stories. Im not a great writer  but I have just written a sci-fI trilogy with another two books planned  each book with 900-1200 pages  and have thousands of proof readers who are fans  screaming for me to publish. there must be thousands of writers like me  so why does amazon make such a poor choice in writers. also  considering the amount of customers money used to produce this production its disgraceful   the acting and director is atrocious  poorly acted  abysmally choreographed and an insult to the original author. itseems  apart from international  european and asian film industries that hollywood and many series productions are done by a group of narrow minded people  who have tunnel vision as to what they think the public wants. film and series requires good writing  directors and actors who at least care for the viewers enjoyment and constructively listen to their thoughts and reviews.
I said  discount eowyn  lol
@melonie mac go boom  oh  I see  my bad
@melonie mac go boom  on the other hand  its an insult even to discounted eowin  lolhell  its even an insult to tolkien s sauron at this point
are they burning that money in the dumpster behind the studio
dont apologize  jaffe has been doing the woke white-knighting thing hard  lately.   funny to see how dismissive and insulting he is to women who disagree with him  but thats par for the course for male feminists.
this has nothing to do with tolkien s incredible works. this is a trash fire that I have zero intention of watching.galadreil is completely misunderstood by these people. in the books  she s serene  dignified  and never flaunts her immense power. she s Godlike. their version is cheapened  and just another unbearable feminist  woman stronk  mary sue character with no depth. they literally dont know what a strong female character looks like. they had one of the best strong female archetypes ever written to draw on  and they completely ruined it because their idea of a strong woman is miserable  petty  nasty  entitled and always playing the victim. they wrote themselves.
its like slow motion dancing video
I have seen better fight choreography from drunken larpers bar hopping after the phx comicon.
it gets funnier m m is in there to    lol    at least the series doesnt put me to sleep watching it like game of thrones   game of thrones is boring sorry to say   rings of power is at least watchable   it does have some action in it   it needs a lot more of it   we want more battles
top gun  maverick had an enormous budget to rent planes  pilots  and crew.it looked so much better than this billion dollar propaganda rewriting of a legendary fantasy story.its an upside down world where shirtless men playing beach volleyball is better than elves versus monters.
my recommendation is stick with the 3 episodes only... they get worse from there! Ive forced myself to watch and will do till the end of season 1. I wish I didn t make that promise to persist.this thing feels like a parody of Lord of the rings and galadriel keeps talking with clenched mouth just like she s always angry or practicing her sideline of ventriloquism.rop is such a skid-mark on the masterpiece tolkien gave us.
it was me.  I stole the budget.
I find that these types can dislike anything and its okay  but if you dislike the same thing  angry joe  Im looking at you  your opinion is istaphobic. it is the dumbest bs ever. you have to like it  they dont have to  but they aren t an istaphobe  but you are.
Im beginning to think this was all an elaborate way to write down a billion dollars on amazon s taxes....
this show is such an insult to tolkien.. galadriel is the daughter of the prince of noldor  and the niece of feanor  the king of the noldor. for those who dont know the silmarilion  the noldorian elves were the first race created by the illuvatah  and were extremely powerful. galadriel could kill those men in that clip in 2 seconds without blinking an eye. so much for honoring this amazing universe amazon.. I refuse to watch it.
and on the other side of the coin you look at something like top gun maverick where they had a story they had a diverse cast they stuck to the script and there was no   virtue signaling or messaging   being done. and they literally pounded their competition into the ground plus made a boatload of cash at the same time for paramount and tom cruise and I am sure that the cast got handsomely paid  and let s not forget those other residual checks that will be paid down the line  as time goes on for them. plus you knew he took care of the production crew behind the scenes. this worked because everybody was on the same page.  what amazon gave us was exactly the opposite
we your followers dictate that you must continue to suffer for our entertainment!
diversity is not the problem here  it is the gut wrenching feminism. worse  morfydd nailed the karen-amazon version of guyladriel.
1.19 - at this moment that girl behind galadriel should be able to kill her by backstab
the most egregious fail of the show is the hobbits. in the movies and books the hobbits are seen by many others as lessers  children or little folk or somehow foolish compared to humans or elves or dwarves. this is of course a mistake  as hobbits prove themselves again and again  ending with the king leading his people in bowing to the hobbit heroes of their story.this show writes hobbits as foolish  selfish  immature children. this is sam and merry and pippin s people  a group who are credited in the books with coming to the aid of others in battle  thus winning the right to the shire from the numenorean kings. they are not superstitious vagrants who will leave their own people to die when they dont have enough mushrooms for the stew.
if david jaffe feels that female-led films and shows get more hate  then no one owes him an apology  because he s deliberately ignoring the facts that prove him objectively wrong. male-led movies have no protection  people have been shitting on certain ones for as long as that asshole has been alive. has he forgotten the reaction to tge star wars prequel trilogy  no  he hasn t  he s just pretending it didn t happen  or doesnt matter  even though it does.
we will make a diverse cast to fight racisim. but  make sure the white actors get the most screen time being racist towards other characters. especially  when its the blonde talking down to the queen  because its easier to push thatsuperiority complex  or the barkeep towards the elf. the harfoots  or whatever they are called  are probably the most entertaining part of the show.
I wonder if melonie watches cobra kaI the one series currenrly ongoing not woke lol
now that I believe
my problem with the show is that it will set a cost for success precedence. if the show fails then others will most likely not want to invest in high production fantasy settings. and if it does do well  then this will be the new bar set. will they care about the narrative and how well the story is told  no  it is and has always been about money and unfortunately it appears money cant buy good scripts.
no she hasn t seen it
@hose a conta razz how do you know  if so though surprising...
the people who came up with this program had an agenda. part of that agenda was to destroy tolkien s work. well  they did not destroy tolkien s work but they did embarrass themselves. the american educational system has been being deliberately dumbed down over the past 60 years. students are not given lists of books of literature to read as was done within the american educational system of the past. nope. most schools  if they encourage reading at all  push newer authors that agree with the ideology of elite academics. if you do not know what that is by now you may want to check out what is happening around you. during the 60s the american educational system was ranked as the best in the world. today it is ranked at 35th in the world. that is disgraceful for a nation that was once the leading nation in industry and was also the most wealthy country in the world. today the u.s. government is many billions of dollars in debt and run by the very people who want to destroy us. the big corporation that produced this piece of crap television series did not take into consideration that there are still some people who have some living brain cells left in their heads. people may want some fantasy to escape into as entertainment but this program is a comedy! was it written by third grade students ! it is insulting to listen to! the acting is laughable! the wardrobe looks like they went to the local costume store  bought some stuff and then went at it with glittery spray paint! dont forget the old bathrobe that they put the guy that dropped from the sky in! the  harfoots!!  what a joke that is with the straw and weeds stuck in their hair! no one will ever figure out that clever disguise!!  if these corporate execs are not totally embarrassed by this piece of crap then they are the dumbest things of all!!
this is as much of a love letter to tolkien as battlefield 2042 was as a love letter to battlefield fans.
dont forget mithrill is now elf heroin and if they dont all get a fix they ll die.  wtf really
rangz is a stunning and brave love letter to our disgusting bigoted fans. 100  5-star reviews  almost nobody cancelled their prime subscription so clearly its a success! sorry  incels. Imean  youre welcome incels.
I ll tell where all the money goes for all shows and movies. too many producers. watch older stuff. one producer  one assistant.
aI ya...even super sentaI has better fight choreography than that. they even had to have her gratuitously smack one of the boys on the butt with the flat of her sword  and if thats not sexist and condescending  then what is   I got screeched at by some sjw type on another video when  among other things  Imentioned how cheap it looked  and it was hilarious in hindsight. I only acknowledge pj s trilogy in the end  ultimately  because those hobbit movies were terrible. jaffe was being a typically condescending  and foul mouthed  male feminist wannabe type  and his kind irritate me.
if I were a woman  I would be done with hollywood.  no one hates women like hollywood liberals.  every female lead must be manly. she must be better than men at all masculine endeavors and eschewing any type of femininity.  galadriel is a textbook example.  these morons took one of the greatest and most enigmatic sorcerers in all of fantasy literature  stripped her of all feminine grace and beauty  and turned her into just another ball-scratching warrior.  Im surprised the character hasn t pulled out a plug of harrowfoot chewing tobacco yet...or is that in episode 5
remember the movie  the producers     .... the original or the remake...I like the original  anyways...iam sure amazon has insurance on this show   so if it flops...they make money..I hope....lol
david jaffe sure likes to deny he champions for women but sure likes to belittle them if they criticize his comments. thats ladies and gents is a classic sign of a male feminist!
rings of girl power yayyyyyyyyyyyyy
love letter    hostage letter maybe.   blackmail   I cant decide whether casting is a larger part of the problem.   but the writing  story  is really bad.   and the time compression along with chopped up sub-plots  instantly transport through time and   or space  just destroys any attempt an epic story.misogynist   galadriel was a female in the books and portrayed by a woman in the show.    so .... nope.homophobic    galadriel was heterosexual in the books  and I assume the show s galadriel is the same.   so.... nope.racist     galadriel was very light skinned in the texts  on the white to black scale  and rings of power galadriel is a white actress.   nope again.I just dont like the character.   and am actually offended by the destruction of a wonderful character.     so much is just wrong with this portrayal of .... well  everything.
watching galadriel mocking the numenoreans with that bad fight coreography is cringeworthy. numenoreans are warriors. they fought alongside the elves against morgoth. pathetic.
1 billion dollar production  can you say embezzlement
they didn t spend it on getting the height differences right! numenorians are supposed to be taller and stronger than middle earth humans. galadriel teaching them to fight is ridiculous. women adopting the worst attributes of the male ego  is not female empowerment. the half foots feet keep changing accents from irish to cornish west country  diversity above ground is logical  although contrived  but not sure how it makes sense underground
wow that fight scene was like something out of an early 00s mad tv spoof only because its not supposed to be a comedy skit it ends up looking really bad. cringe af
no one can honestly explain how 5 rings is a good show.its pure cw drivel. not worthy of a tolkien epic
this scene is pirates of the caribbean. its not tolkien. and the pj films did justice to galadriel  c mon! he turned her into a wailing banshee. it is interesting to see people bash rop for much of the same cut rate and shlock work that was prevalent in the pj trilogy. both are pretty terrible.
the infinite crowd are the people who wrote positive comments  where it was a few copy pasted.
I dont understand this modern obsession with needing  representation . arent asians represented by rhun  arent blacks already represented by the orcs and wargs  arent browns represented by the easterlings  tolkien s world was already a very richly diverse place
melonie I love your hair !
I dont know who this david guy is  or what his credentials are  or even what he said to get this all started  but if he is involved in God of war  he has no right calling other people morons  as that franchise is to mythology as eggs roasted on the side walk is to fine dinning. and if he isn t involved in God of war  calling someone a  little moron  is a very reductive  emotional  and overly defensive act that reeks of poor intellect  especially when you cant even watch a full sentence of a video.in short  the bro s a tool!
small comment on the david jaffe thing...not only is his comment a blanket statement  but its also very unintelligent and just throwing out blanket catch words etc. I d like to know how thinking marvel s idea of a strong female character just being a mary sue man with boobs  meaning they act like men  but have boobs and can do no wrong  and are not in any way actually portrayed as strong female characters  how is this possibly homophobic or racist ! I can understand maybe labeling it as misogynistic  but the other two  thats just ignorant. with thatsaid even marvel has gotten the strong female character right on occasion  black widow being an example. as you can see here in an excellent video on this subject by abbie emmons https   youtu.be argt2xmhn2e
I wonder what race of people they hired for production.  what is this shows esg score   lol
dear melonie. you  like many others including myself  feel the same way about this abomination they dare to call a lotr piece. ok fine  that aside- which arguments did you exactly make to oppose the details and whole episodes in your 15 min. video in which only half that time was about rop and the other half about you defending your own  front   in a nutshell- you  are not a tolkien fan  nor are you here doing vids because you want to be heard or your thoughts discussed  whatever the topic. you want to be seen. so my comment on all your past and future videos is as follows  the effort you put on those eyebrows  fingernails..your look  is legendary! its not the things that you do  but the way and manner in which you do them  insults true fandom among females. therefore if your message is not about how f.e. galadriel was with celeborn  roaming around  at the time   but with comments and arguments already said  but more about you adjusting your hair  feeling self absorbed with all that outer beauty and that awfully insincere  apology to a person far beyond your level of intelligence and awareness  then might as well consider doing different kind of videos. at least it will be honest. food for thought  neh
God thx for the normal woman on this world
david jaffe cant do a simple action thats been in metroid since 1986. he s a poser  a newb and who cares what he says.samus punked him. not like a speedbooster puzzle for an energy tanks  just a basic action.
the show is actually good  melonie  treat it like  a fan fiction  webseries on youtube. yeah  episode 5 was kinda bad  but the show overall is good ish
budget went to the sea because sea is always right.
it used to be that anything that wanted to slap on the tolkien label had to bend over backwards to prove their worth before even getting past the discussion phase. what the fuck changed to let rings of boredom slip past the defences
do you guys wonder if they lied about the budget to get more viewers
they spent too much on  superfans  events and to rig the reviews...
did the majority of the budget go to sauron  he is close friends with bezos...
bollywood would be jealous.
hollywood is like a cat owner trying to turn their pet vegan.
...apparently into people s pockets...
amazon has copied and pasted their viewer numbers  why wouldn t rop copy and paste a crowd  soon they ll be editing out the extras they dont like.
dantes rings of money laundering
right which is why pharazon is going to build a wall around numenor and make the elfs pay for it.
that guy you are responding to at the end  just tell him to stop mansplaining to you and thatshould shut him up.
the money went to someones coke habit or to paying off someones baby momma
where are the rings  where is the power
the budget went to luxury travel and peoples pockets.
I dont think you needed to apologize.
where now are the horse and the rider  where is the horn that was blowing where is the helm and the hauberk  and the bright hair flowing where is the harp on the harpstring  and the red fire glowing where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing they have passed like rain on the mountain  like a wind in the meadow
rings of power over she-hulk
someone is surely pocketing cash here.....
is it a huge money-laundering scheme  cos that would explain a lot!
that acting is like a bad own and hallmark movie
what is that meme website she went to
rings of boredom
do.not.apologize to these people!
love letter from fatal attraction
you miss out a funny scene of rings of power where they copied and pasted some extras up to 3 times to create a crowd I truly wonder where the budget for this show is gone  in a year or so we will find out that the producers have run away with millions of dollars
money laundering     thats how it works  budget claimed spent is not shown in the final product
the hobbitshould have been 2 films. there   back again. the studio demanded 3 which is why there is so much bloat.
where did the money go to the pockets.laundered  bribed  you name it.
he called you names. you deserve the apology.
its so bad to you but you keep watching.
I have no doubt the people who wrote this stuff  have not read the source material. just like the  tolkien superfans  amazon hired.
why is this galadriel little short. according to the books galadriel is 6ft 4in. morfydd clark is 5 feet 7 inches
never
even worse  morfydd clark is 5 3 . they made no effort to make her look tall like she should be. no one can come close to cate blanchett. they should have used her and put that budget toward making her look younger. either that or pick another tall woman with cate s features
she supposed to be taller than those boys
1 million dollars per minute. lol
they wont listen to feedback from true fans.  the only way to ensure they dont make more of this crap in the future is to not watch and hope they cancel future episodes due to lack of interest.
facts
it looks like a poorly choreographed dance. if you watch the behind the scenes you will hear them proudly declare that this galadriel sequence was shot in a single day itshows.also - is that a bengal cat  9 33
embezzlement
did amazon really care about what the writers did to this show  or did they just need a multi-million dollar tax write off
jeff bezos must ask what happened to the rest of the 500 million dollar I closed my amazon prime video I am done with rings of shit and amazon lime
bollywood coordinates much better.
they paid  1b guys the rights to a vehicle to push their message. thats it. they dont care about its history or canon or even the characters and story they re creating. its all message.
all this budget and they have worse fight choreography than into the badlands season 3
cosplay actors would have done a better choreographed fight scene.
for securing the rights.
what happens when you buy aetsy aragorn  ebay lagerta  and wish gandalf. dwarf queen lizzo is good for a laugh though
the rings of sour
for the me the fight scene sucked because it didn t tell us anything we didn t already know. we already know galadriel is a great fighter and nigh untouchable in a fight...so what was accomplished beyond making the soldiers look incompetent and like they never even looked at a sword until the scene in place  even her advice was childish  it basically amounted to.. the pointy end goes into bad guy ..Imean seriously the weakness in the writing is never more obvious then in this scene.
I dont believe it is the best thing I have ever seen but I dont understand all the hate either...
the wrongs of power
shit is just turning silly now
call it a money laundering scene. no way they spent that much money on this shit.
I think galadriel fight scene was okay  come on. the real problem is the fkn waste of time filler episodes.... one more season to land in middle earth
its not made for lotr fans like us. its mad efor those who have no knowledge or locality to the source material. I have read so many comments saying jow good the last episode was. amd I cant even force myself to start watching it
true.
who is this show made for
rings of power is getting laughable I cant stop laughing at it
bro he s so trying to be a champion  and try to deflect it
r.o.p. oops I did it again
Im watching a youtube video  of a youtuber  watching a youtube  of them being watched on youtube by some other guy on youtube.
where the money goes  to the reviewers. they probably paid  20m for each review. lol
did you stop doing verse of the day at the end of your vids  I just haven t seen any in awhile.
the fight scene in this episode is stupid af xd
it just keeps getting worse....
with a show this bad  it makes you wonder  where is the money
remember people  your order of random tat you could probably do without paid for this shite
thoughts on the last of us hbo trailer
can someone please tell me how to get ahold of a youtuber or their channel people. I have information on the rings of power  here I am trying to figure out how to contact someone so they can share it with the world but nobody returns their emails or even has an email address available..
amazon already knew they had a turd on hand long before sept 2nd. they re not stupid.
35 days til  halloween
eowyn  she s a dollar store neo. everything from the show is dollar store. even the visual effects that everyone is praising so much look fake.
follower count this past week
yes I stopped. was adding too much extra time to the videos and was putting me in a position to have to rush around to find verses  I d rather not rush something like that. I still talk about my faith regularly on my platforms  but no verses in every single video any more
email me! I wanna see! meloniemacirl at gmail
know what also had laughable choreography  the new matrix movie. it was better than this  and perhaps just not shot right. though  I do remember watching it and trying not to laugh in the theater.
the trueth  is  how the show is no where near  respecting the tolkien s continuity    where is the long hair on the elleven people    also  where did the money go  like the writers dont even know how to write at all . its  worse then embarrassment  . in my book  this is the worst  thing .  the writers have not even close  to the cannon of tolkien . its a sin and they should all be in jail  on how mess-up the ip poisoned  Lord of the rings  . no wonder  Lord of the rings mmo  was pulled  tolkien s ghost pulled it  from amazon    how dos a massive company  like amazon  do such poor writing and directing . I am now worried about star gate and robocop and all mgm legacy  . wow this is bad .   lazy writing and lazy  implementation. Lord of the ring has been burned to the ground .
shit looks like something on the cw
looks money laundry to me
you probably should have used more tact  but he clearly doesnt deserve it. he didn t give you any respect or show you any benefit of the doubt. he made fun of pointless stuff irrelevant to your argument  because he knows he has no argument. dude s a manbaby who cant control his emotion at all. not worth anyone s time to deal with people like that.
get woke go broke
I ll never watch it
u look like the  v  Imade in cyberpunk 2077 game.. damn so identical
seriously  they have bastardized galadriel.
david jaffa has fallen so far.
he a lawd dem rangs!!!
if people hate it that much why do they keep watching
the sociopathic hobbitses make me sad
cool tats.
3 episodes . really  dropped this sh    after 1.5 -
everybody gets offended at the drop of the hat. dude sticks and stones will break my bones  but words will never hurt me! grow up!
maybe they did the golan globus thing. get the funds for a movie  use half of it. use the rest to make more crappy movies.
the show is stinkier than a tunafish mac dinner mixed with french vanilla coffee fart.
its less of a  love letter  to tolkien and more of an anthrax letter with racial slurs.
forrest gump did better with the copy pasting crowd in the speech in dc scene and thats from 1994. so why is it that a show cant do this in 2022 with the astronomical advancements in tech since then  I feel for those who are being paid to make this stuff.
jaffe has fans
I wonder how much of the budget went to diversity and inclusion consultants
so you are turning the other cheek.
hey! .... the sea is always right.
Im sorry you are being forced to watch this.
its not even the coreography. look at her face  literally struggling through every move.  graciouselves
blonde hair and blue eyes huh
does anyone else feel thatsomething is off about all of this   half a billion spent and yet cheap cgI  cheap bad writing  cheap bad fabricated armor and swords  cheap bad choreographed fights....ect. is this all a money laundering scheme
only masochists are still watching this show.
face palm  you put a few fingers to your forehead for a second mid comment about wanting to facepalm thats not facepalming  yet he makes some big deal out of you  literally just facepalm . makes me wonder if he knows what an actual facepalm moment is
money laundering...
where did the money go  boats and hos  boats and hos.
do youreally believe they spent a billion dollars on a tv show  they re exaggerating that number to make itseem bigger and more important. its probably not even close to that number.
dont say that.I think youre head is just lovely.its a pefect size head.xd
money laundering....
who cares what she says  when does she show skin.
it is a love letter to tolkien.  unfortunately the entirety of the letter is   I  would love to take a huge dump on everything you have done.  notmygaladriel
yeah putting an old pair of panties on his head was juvenile. or probably a  panty and stocking  rip off.
why is that dwarf responding to melanie
thats what Im wondering. the billion dollar budget doesnt add up
spray painted plastic and printed shirts is not what I expected. I expected fantastic costumes sullied by bad writing.
why would you take it down  you say you wont do it again but if you do it once then that opens the door. I dont think that you should private it leave it up because you know he s not gonna take down his offensive tweet directed towards your friends so why are you being considerate of his feelings
this looks like disney made another descendants made for tv movie. or just re-enacting the shit-tastic last jedI fight.
this will not make five seasons.
are you judy alvarez model   d
bad robot people at the center of a blatant cash grab production....you dont say
larpers at a renn faire would do better.
do an episode with no makeup on
they paid a bunch of literal amateurs to run this show.  the main characters are only making around 20k an episode.  where is all the money going
racist!   sexist! every single one of us would rather watch a movie about storm from x-men.
he needs to white knight because he is responsible for the greatest chad in all of video game history...he needs to virtue signal to keep the cathedral sjw s from noticing him...
youre way classier than him.
thats what a billion  with a b  a billion dollars paid for   it reminds me of what 6 year olds would come up with if they made a play  in fact I would rather watch the 6 year olds.
cool
old jackie chan s kung fu  movies were much better than this ring of shjt
bezosy is losing a shait load of money here.
melonie mac change my mind the last of us hbo series would be better with thomas jane who played punisher in 2004 movie would be a better joel than pedro pascal
yearhhhhh..... social media on these topics are wayyy surpassing the shit produced by the studios. are we surprised  Imean we want to see great shows. we want to see escapism and adventure  and faaaaark me  I love strong feminine heroines. but I hate illogical  irrational  2020 s mary sue driven idealogues  characters  and in-your-face social agendas. why are they part of modern storytelling ack  who the fuck knows  I dont watch  because why would I want to  why would anyone want to first time viewer of your channel. love the ink and thoughts. dont go changin .ps - dont hold back  in my opinion. character-hit and criticise. everyone else is putting themselves out there  and they re fair game.
she clearly isn t athletic enough to sell that. she looks awful swinging a sword  did they even train her !
5 00 costumes do look terrible.  thats especially terrible compared to what Im use to seeing in video games.  my citation   assassin s creed   odyssey - all armor sets and outfits showcase -  all dlc    jan 20  2020  on channel  hectorlo.
they would need to fire most of marvel s writters first.
@fiction theorizer  eh. they d probably make itso thatstorm used to be a man  come to think of it.
@vic 2.0  rubbish  Im not watching that movie  if it happened like that. hell no
@silverfox   lol  same.
@vic 2.0  probably right around the corner if we re being honest.
yeah thats what Imeant to say with my video  the woke crowd very well may have made him feel guilty for creating such a chad character that he feels the need to make up for it in a sense now with the more woke takes he has. but tbh  I dont think he should feel guilty for what he created at all  people are just too soft.
@melonie mac go boom  he should just follow kratos s lead and not give a fudge about crap like this... but these people get targeted right in the wallet  you loose your job if you dont speak out  the twitter mobs fake or real can really drain all your energy  like 1000 s of digital vampires... one day soon you may be doing videos about the new God of war and how kratos  is now a transman who falls in love with thor or something...brokeback mount olympus....
you want to really see cheap go look at what the activist Iman actors got paid... guylad got paid about 20k an episode and even though she is the falling star most of the cast got paid more then her about 25 to 35k an episode in general
oh  you said cheap horses   I thought you said something else hollywood is known for.
@meloniemac the show has been good though and season 1 is not done. I actually like rop can I debate you on your channel  maybe I can get some of your fake bot subs...your cute tho I like you..but u shud delete this video..if not ill debate you and @disparu
so are you going to get back to the Christian value point of your content  the original stuff  or youre just gonna be like every other platform out there
Im convinced this project is a money laundering scam at this point. everything about this show screams low budget shitshow. that fight scene looks like they might as well have ripped it out of the tlj throne room and just edited it.
cia and ccp money in  clean money out.
galadriel is a devic being not a karen
yes... elves will take human jobs. embarrassingly bad is right.
I watched episode 4 and 5 recently... nothing exciting happens. the most is a corny fight with midgets and a crappie sword fight
not as bad as she hulk but stopped watching it and rings of wierdo s  rather watch seal team coz its not as terrible.
no wonder all they would brag about was a puerto rican elf .... the show misses on almost everything
valinor was pure bliss..... back when little galadriel was beating up the other kids... .to be honest  I think they re ripping off some old dungeons and dragons type script and just throwing in some middle-earth names.. its pretty clear these writers are clueless about tolkien s creation.. anyway  about the hobbit movies  Im giving peter jackson some leeway. when he made the Lord of the rings movies  he had four years to prepare.with the hobbit  he was given a three month deadline to pick up the pieces after del toro suddenly left.the other option was to sack the thousands of people working on the movies.the hobbit movies are not exactly what I and others - including peter jackson himself - hoped for  but Im still glad they exist. there are still a lot of things about them I like.Imean I finally got to see what went down at dol guldur. thats something I wanted to know about ever since I was a kid reading the hobbit.
the armor in this show is so poor. any time I see soldiers of numanor  the helmets dont fit  there s no shoulder or leg protection  and the breastplates look pathetically cheap and lack simple details that could ve easily been improved. and thats a minor issue considering everything else about this show.
monry lanudering
Ive seen better choreography from medieval l.a.r.p.ers
look. I hate this show with every fiber of my being but using plastic armor for a brief 5 second shot that can only be noticed if you freeze-frame it is not one of my biggest concerns. hollywood is supposed to be about creating illusion.
this is hate mail
10 30 confirmed  woke simps are cringe.
ouch thats rough to watch... galadriel girl seems so out of energy  like she s not even trying in thatscene  looks cheap  boring and like they didn t care.
hey pretty lady
woah is this for real    I need to look up this source because 20k per episode for the lead role sounds insanely underpaid for a production like this. I will look this up  but if you could point me in the direction of this info that would help a lot  thank you
I just hope amazon will waste a boatload of money for 5 seasons of this shite...
the dialogues in rop are so cringe.
david jafe shouldn t have used a peice of trash film such as captain marvel as something to defend.  what he should complain about is that melonie wants rings of power ads to play when I click on her videos.   as c3-po would say   here we go again!   my opinion is that talking about these trash shows is social  media engagement  and thats what will be sold to advertisers  networks  etc.
I stopped watching after the second ep and feel extremely glad for not watching the rest of this shitshow
they picked this crap over conan  hahahahhaah crom laughs at amazon!!!
this show is a parody like the scary movie franchise spoofing other horror movies. the choreography is mortal kombat annihilation cringe. lol
dude uses generalizations and also doesnt know basic anatomy that a 5 year old does. somebody needs to explain the difference between the palm and the fingers to him.
dont point the gun at me but you can create media and shows that is diverse  woke  and has underlying real world political themes and messages. its just that if the writing is ass  then its ass.
hahaha they literally ruined show
dont fool yourself.it will never be a parallel writing  adding new material.it will always be history rewriting.just have a look at what they recently done with the live action pinocchio.pinocchio is now depicted not anymore as easily manipulatable and always go for the quick instead of the long road  but as the one unlucky with his adventures and friends.like  where in the f ck is the moral part in that
this is a pop culture  thing made for  teeniewolfie-vampire diarrhea-for the narrrnniaaaaa   fans.this is not a serious tv movie.but its name shouldnt be  rings of power    this is wrong.this is a shame because they ruin tolkiens  legacy...even I am a halfblooded turkish-caucasian person  I can realize that
its a cheesy cw show. xena level.
algorithm comment
there is no excuse for the copying and pasting faces. there is aI software that can make an unlimited number of unique humans faces.
for all you true tolkien fans all you got to do is what us real star trek fans did with discovery... just disregard it  dont watch it  dont talk about it... it doesnt exist.
im gonna be honest here. its 1am. I am drunk  I just saw the title  and I like the show and Im gonna defend it
money laundering anyone
no forgiveness  no mercy  destroy the soy!!
amazon is a trillion dollars company and they cant even make a good show  pathetic
a woman disliking something a man made is not misogyny. by any stretch of the imagination. maybe the director needs to look in his pants and remember he s the man in the scenario.where did the budget go  to paying everybody the exact same amount as the most expensive actor. woke is as woke does.
jaffe should know better  he needs to explain his words in better context than just saying the popular phrases. dude needs to man up! new follower here  thanks for the content!
amazon just released a statement saying that this is the fake  rings of power.  the real  rings of power  will air next year. suckers!
cw s legends of tomorrow has better choreography than this.
crews are paid shitty but massive budgets but you never see where the money goes.... big budget failures are just money laundries for mega corps the reported loss is intentional.
great show  but stay on the bandwagon.
xena the warrior princes was thousand times cheaper and it was thousand times better
smh!!! this is a damn good show!! why are we picking this apart again
4 09 can we give a shout out to archduke charles of austria for defending this crap by saying it was filmed during pandemic Jesus the depts those creatures are willing to go just to excuse this shitshow. Imean if they find a balrog who smacks them thats fine or they could just stay in their deep caves of wokeness and be happy as the goblins they are. the show is a joke but the more alarming thing for me is the creatures who like it and call me names cuz I dont.
I know you all have to continue to watch to make detailed reviews  but I gave up.
Im leaning toward embezzlement and money laundering as to why this piss poor show was made
hahahaha! copy-paste! where is waldo
galadriels contemptive smirk angers me!
well thats what you get when youre priority is diversity and not talent.
I never made it through the first episode....show is a failure on all levels
no one is saying he was deliberately virtue signalling  the critism of his statement was that it was completely unfair to say male critics of female led films are sexist misogynistic homophobic and racist   it makes absolutely no sense  especially when their critisms are of a poorly written female character  to a the point female fans are upset with it and are calling it out  not because she is a female lead.  male fans dont need to have the female lead to have sex appeal that wd also be poor writing  what they want is for them to have character and struggles that they overcome  rather than a hero who is already a hero and doesnt go through any change what so ever its uninteresting.
all those people glad they got paid up front on this one hehe. look  they fired and got ride of all the good decent level headed writers  and hired woke political ones and thus all the product stinks now.  nothing new or good has come out of hollywood any good in a long time.  top gun is an exception. again  a remake of something written back in the 80 s that was not as politicized as it is today.
the worst part is all the paid shills in the media and elsewhere who defend this pile of cgI garbage. unfortunately its a trend of our times  soulless entertainment with writing and
Im tired of the woke agenda in our beloved series and movies
xena did it better
what was the point of this video
looool
what part of the rings of power do you find to be horrible. please give details with a minute detail and which episode. and yes there was a balrog in the last episode
if you made a shaka zulu movie with an old white guy in the tribe it be about the same thing but yeah critics gotta be racists right lol
worse than bat man and robin fight scenes from the adam west days    bif pow crash!
click bait
get woke  go broke the show covers all the bases there is homeless gays lesbians oppressed racist homophobs list goes on and on.......its a shame they didn t follow tolkien silmarillion and make all us fans an insane high fantasy series.oh wait it looks amazing tho hahaha!!!!!!!.
the sword twirls are so lame.
looks cheap
a billion dollar for such a crap.
well  this diversity is not working. but since we re trying the same dumb experiments hoping for different results  why not try a diverse  black panther   how about an all white  mulan   how about an all male cast of  bridesmaids
really where and for what they spend billion ... 0 a list actors  all look cheap and acting is on  beginner level.. costumes are like you say on amateur cosplay level
you want to be formally respectful. however  you shouldn t have to mince words. your video was fine.
why do you keep saying its a billion dollar production    . there s no way somebody s going to spend a billion dollars to make a television show and a not follow the source material and b make it as woke as possible how. you mean to tell me there wasn t anybody to say hey we re spending a billion dollars on this we might want to do this this and this instead of this this and this nobody a billion dollars I refuse to believe that a studio spending billions of dollars on a tv show would set themselves up for failure like that. there is no way anybody would spend a million dollars and say yeah let s do a bunch of woke s
I didnt watch that video  I have no interes in gow  so I have no idea how he feel he was misrepresented...but if hes calling people  sexist  misogynist isto-phobes  whatever for critiquing movies then yea... he is a bad person.sorry  he is literally smearing people for disagreeing with him.are there sexists and misogynists hating on these movies  almost 100  guaranteed.but theyre are such an insignificant number its not even worth bringing them up. or even they have valid arguments and dont have to resort to sexism ive been on youtube for almost a decade and a half.what content I consume has changed over time but one constant factor has been gaming and movies and I believe I can count on one hand the number of comments ive seen that were geniunely bigoted and had no valid criticism.im not counting trolls in this  the whole point of a troll is not being sincere.but out of all the comments ive seen on movies and games thatsays  this movie game suck  I dont think ive seen more than 5 that didnt have a valid explaination as to why they thought so and which had some sort of antI woman or minority sentiment.sometimes theyre incorrect  but if they dont know theyre incorrect itstill makes sense for them to not like the movie and it doesnt make them bigots.saying  its so stupid that gollum carried the ring and not frodo  that broke the whole narrative for me  is an incorrect statement but if someone thought thats what happened it would still be a valid reason for them to not like the movie and there is no insms or phobes involved.yes  its a purposly exaggerated example  to make a point.saying  ariel is supposed to be white  is no more racist than saying  shaft is supposed to be black .end of story  there is no argument to be had here  these statements are axiomatically true.if you call someone  anyone  a racist over these statements makes you a bad person.so  for this fataxx lunatic to call people things like this means one of two things.1  he doesnt read any comments at all and just trust the mainstream media  which makes him a usful idiot  thats a bad person.2  he does read the comments but he actually agrees with the sjw lunatics  that makes him literally evil and a bad person.so... yea... hes a bad person.fakk that guy.edit not singling someone out might sound like a good thing but it actually makes it worse.cuz thats literally putting the smear on everyone.thats attributing this to everyone who disagrees with him.im not saying singling someone out would be the right thing to do or even a good thing.the right thing to do wouldve been to not open his fakking tap about people he knows nothing about in the first place...but since he didnt...if he did single someone out that would actually  possibly  give validity to his statements.he could think this person was racist or sexist for x  y and z reasons due to this persons actions or statements.that would be a person he actually knew the first fakking thing about.not singling someone out is literally shit talking millions of people he dont know a single God damn thing about other than that they dont like one thing he likes and he hasnt even bothered finding out why but just says its cuz theyre the worst people on the planet.it actually only make him an even bigger fakking cxnt and an even worse person.
