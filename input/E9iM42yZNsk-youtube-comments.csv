you and jeremy should go on tim pool to discuss the defeminization of female characters in pop culture. I think it would be a great show.
gaming journalists  we re on strike. gamers  oh no anyway. also happy ash wednesday melonie.
I cant believe you blamed it on the dog!! it looked very innocent when it looked back at you.
I remember the mid-2000 when I would go to my college s computer lab early and sit down with a coffee and read the daily news on joystiq  kotaku  gamesradar  etc... you know  when enthusiast press was actually enthusiastic.its incredible how much things have changed  after the feminist push it all just went crashing down and got worse and worse every year.
gaming journolists   we re going on strike! gamers
I hope this is the nail in the coffin for those gaming journos  they didn t care about video games anyway  social justice was their first priority.
remember when kotaku actually had respectable journalists  good old days.
yeah  all of those  gaming journalists  could disappear and have zero effect on the gaming industry. bye.
its rare to find someone this based a with  4 eyeliner game. effort doesnt start or stop solely on content. btw your content is top notch and presentation always matters.
let s hope thatstrike keeps going indefinitely. I really like the verse of the day you do at the end of the videos.
come on  mel. any kotaku  journalist  is already getting paid more than they deserve. I just wish I was there so I could throw a beer bottle at them and yell  stop picketing the dry cleaners!
awwww that goat tower is epic!! those goats are living their best life. the one on top is saying  Im king of the world!! .edit  its totally cool sharing your jerky cooking life stuff. we can see how happy it makes you talking about that kind of stuff and I for one try to encourage people when I can see them so happy about something like that. we all deserve to be happy and if something makes you excited or passionate then we usually want to share that with people. so keep it up mel  we just want you to be happy.
might I say  your channel is something I just found  binge watched all your videos and its like a fresh breath of air hope you grow huge on youtube. keep up the good work love from australia.
hey mel  hope you and your pup and kitty are doing well.  its thanks to you and the quartering among others that help keep my faith in a brighter tomorrow.
Im not very religious but hearing your interpretations and scripture bits... idk it probably isn t everyone s thing but as the only one in my circle with some faith  its nice to hear you talk about it. its nice to see someone else who likes what I like and also thinks what I think. its probably not for everyone but I sincerely hope this channel never stops growing. its so nice that you ve built this little community of like minded ppl. with the way the world has been  its so great to have your based channel as it makes ppl like me feel heard
10 06 I almost died laughing. I saw your eyes darting around and I was like...she s gonna say it...boom she said it. I dig the comment commentary. more youtubers should do that. the positive interaction is fun  and it will help take the bite out of the negative comments. too many youtubers get their panties all in a bunch over a couple of grumblers in the comments section. those should be a source of laughter  not anxiety. keep roastin. genx boomer out.
Ive been a fan of yours for a while. love the content youre sharing here. hope the batman is good!
hImelonie I seriously   how much youbring out all these interesting topics.takecare melonie
journos on strike  weird  going on strike is supposed to make things more inconvenient for regular people so that they support them.also  how long is it your  brand new channel   I thought about it and then realized its been less than a month and youre already part of my daily routine. great stuff. love the content.
I stopped reading kotaku articles on game reviews  and got feedback from non biased streamers instead. but as for the strike  I can see their side of it  I just did a quick check on the avg salary was and staff writers make an average  26 to 45k so I d say they re unjustly compensated and it needs to be adjusted with the current cost of living.
@hermit card  why cant we have both
@jones foodtruck   cause tim is now a grace randolph
@jones foodtruck  I agree  but there are more important political subjects tim would rather cover at the moment. maybe when things calm down it would be a possibility. g g dont deal with those political matters  and therefore they would be a better chance  and some connections with daily wire  so ben shapiro could maaaaaaaaay interview her  to keep pushing back in the cultural and entertainment wars.
I would love to see melonie and gina carano in the same room. I think the energy would be off the wall and it would be good for the heart!
great idea.
pim tool
you stole the joke I was about to make.
if their on strike they cant write crappy woke reviews so let them strike

remember game pro
dont forget the rainbow mafia the second half of the problem!
I remember when I was in 8th grade  I used to go to an internet cafe after school to check gaming news on gamesradar. it was the time when gaming journalists cared   focused on games   gamers. now its just  gamers are bad   sexists     put some quotas of lgbtq     pocs in games.
tuntuntuntutututuntun
I dont  because they never did.
when
they didn t  we just didn t care about that as much  but they weren t complete trash either.
no.
what  when lmao
tbh  it might possibly lead to games improving.
literally  all of them.
I agree. she talks about current events and also fun topics its not always about outrage.
thank you so much
@melonie mac go boom  take pewdiepie for an example.. became popular for a specific type of video  playing games .. but then people love his philosophy  cooking  etc videos.. if its something you like doing  its worth giving it a shot  I d check it out at least once if you made random topic videos... meat chips in sour cream sounds f in dope thoughnot doing keto right now.. but when I was  my energy levels and general feeling of being healthy were off the hook
I honestly have been trying to get on a keto carnivore diet for years  but with how busy I am at unI as a student  and not being able to have my kitchen stuff ready to use all the time in the dorms   I keep finding myself going for the easy mcdonalds and junk    its definitely a matter where I just need to completely reorganize my life so I can put appropriate time into making my own food again. I love cooking  and used to do it a lot before unI and during lighter semesters  and the sad part is I actually can feel the yuckiness when I eat food that isn t great for my body.
ah  thats a shame about those game journos. anyway...who s got the lysol  whoo!
I love using my convection oven dehydrator to make my own seasonings. its a world of difference from stuff you buy at a regular store. freshly grinding up some dehydrated onion onion skin  garlic  bell pepper  chilis  mushrooms  various salts  all to your own preferences...life-changing. making your own seasoning blend is very enjoyable and rewarding.
unless Im at home I cannot watch streams on twitch. personally Im mostly a youtube stream watcher since twitch does not have an app on roku. keep up the good work. lol got to the  okay boomer  part you literally got me to lol edit  I like the tidbits....with one exception  Im hungry now.
I get all my gaming news from youtube channels like this. I literally use none of those supposed sources. Im sure Im not alone.
melonie hope all is well with the family n looks like we are winning
you look comfortable and happy with your new channel. have you ever considered voice over work on a new coming anime or a game cuz that would be dope!!! cant wait for a cookbook produced by you  it would be his name is tom hardy love your channel!!! go boom!!!
gaming journalist go on strikegamers  party time
imagine a normal person walking by there seeing that and asking a stranger whats going on.person a   what are they striking for  .person b  oh  these people  they re gaming journalists .person a   gaming journalism  yeah bro  I dont think thats an actual thing .person b   unfortunately  its is .person a   what has the world come to...
10 07 Im dying of laughter and chips...made of meat!  I gotta go get myself a dehydrator
if kotaku  journos  go on strike but no one cares enough to notice  is it really a strike  xd
lol  I have the same dehydrator as you.  I wasn t expecting that to pop up this video.  not the reason I view this channel  but Im laughing my @   off.  worlds are colliding!  keep up the good work  your videos are lots of fun.
hello  just subscribed.  it was a wonderful surprise to find a Christian behind the mic covering topics of interest to me.  Ive been on kind of a youtube anti-woke content binge since the release of a wheel of time on that....one...woke streaming service I wont mention.Im sure other creators are Christians as more and more people get red pilled and I see things like a.j. making an appearance on nerdorotic and hear him mentioned in places like the knights watch streamers.  a.j. has thatshow i.w. that you can only view on his website.  you have a large community surfing the internet looking for this exact content. so congratulations!  I will secretly classify you as my favorite since you are an open follower of Jesus.also  I liked the ground beef bit.  it being easier to chew was something mind blowing to me  you know because jerky box hard.  so dont put your jerky in a box.
I for one fully support these games journalists going on strike. in fact  I wish they did it more often.
gaming journalists going on strike yes  very sad. anyway.
nice video. keep up the good work.
when someone talks about video game journalism I remember papa franku roasting them with his epic laugh
this is the greatest news of all time.
what s the over under on how long melonie will call this channel brand new
I never thought about ground beef jerky. thanks for the idea
nerdrotic.  couldn t edit.
also  10 08 killed me even though I prepared myself for you to say it cause I knew it was coming. bwahhahaha.
gee  being a blogger that works 2-3 hours a week and gets told what to write about the free games they re given is such a tough life...
good way to demonstrate just how little value they hold
not only do most game journalists not reflect most gamers  they straight up hate  most gamers. they despise their own audience. I hope they stay on strike. they are not needed.
melonie well the good thing is we are getting more tactical mil-sim games like six days of fallujah and more shooters on console . looking forward for farm 51 ww3 they  will release the open beta on pc march something if the beta gets more players on it they will release it to consoles for free  !
the  ok boomer  come back. savage!
jalopnik is basically the kotaku of car news.
I love that Bible verse!  its so wonderful to know that God cares about whether or not we get a good good night s rest.  it makes me happy.
is there some way we can have this strike persist indefinitely
gaming journalists  we are going on strike!most gamers  to be honest I didn t remember you existed.
wow  they are on strike  nice!
nice  this means games might actually be good again!
when I want news on a game I look at ppl I dont like and if they hate the game I know I ll like it.
I somehow managed to miss this video yesterday. had to search for the channel on youtube to find it. weird...
mimir describes melonie in God of war   but I believe he called her gondul the valkyrie.
what do we want  politics!how do we want it  boot licks! how I imagined their strike chant would go
love the tidbits  you are just as awesome in real life as you are in your channel! I can attest  Imet you once at pax seattle a long time ago and the selfie I took with you is still in my pc. you are even more of an inspiration now! keep the good fight going and rocking the word of God!as for those gizmodo media people on strike  I know not all of them are bad but  with their reputation it just looks like a bunch of  self-important  useless people asking for more money for just existing.I am interested in the carnivore diet. right now I still take in way to many carbohydrates  white rice is my kryptonite . I hope to work up the courage and discipline to take that first step and keep it going. I feel I optimistic with you and Jesus helping. stay safe and God bless!
when are you doing the melonie mac go cook youtube channel  I would love to see your recipes
nice   I hope thatstrike means they wont work for somebody else during that time
keep watering your new channel with fresh prayers and it continue to growing. you will also see a big yeald! your friend and prayer warrior out here in the great county of lancater  pa. better known as amish country.
nowie   Im farting cause I got into your snacks.
keep giving carnivore diet ideas. I just got my local butcher to start making me bacon jerky  its amazing!
actually  wait. are they underpaid  or is this to protest from for not making them an easy mode
gotta keep it 100  they could all get fired and I would live on in peace
legacy media is dying  from wokeness  yes  vut also convience. I can pull up a video from a youtube channel I trust and listen to it while going about my day or working.  its easier and can usually trust the source. plus they tend to get reviews updates out faster.
omg gaming journos on strike   how will we cope with the loss
would it be a bad thing of all those  journalists  disappeared and were replaced by actual journalists
that boI paul tassI out here still grinding...
oooh  msn messenger. I loved thatservice. though I was an aim kid  lol.
happy to be an mel s boomer!
I enjoyed this . didn t realise you were a Christian . dont hear people saying that much anymore do you
I guarantee it wasn t about fair pay. their bosses keep telling them to stick to games  they re probably demanding editorial control to veto their bosses.
replace them with people actually willing to do the job they were assigned to do  ie  reporting on games.  problem solved. but then youtubers have basically filled that void at this point.
mel s dog went  boom  today!
dont let the door hit you on the ass on the way out !Imean  there should be an easy mode for that...
my mom always blamed the dog too.
union  breaks grounddog  breaks wind...I vote for the dog
like the cooking tidbits...good ideas are always welcome!
companies are going to learn sooner than later these people are no longer needed
you know if kotaku wants to hire me as a scab I ll do it when Im off my real job. I dont head health benefits or minimum wage  just give me some beer money for each article. Imean how hard can it be to write  top ten tracks from mario kart that proves the patriarchy is engrained in toxic kart culture
turnkey chips sounds like a product that makes money
I remember female characters like sarah from virtually fighter  chin like from street fighter iI  almost ever fighting game had one hit female characters.what was wrong with them
if you can stream to both at the same time  stream to both till one buys you out of streaming on the other. youtube is garbage for discoverability unless you have someone big pushing you  and twitch is... twitch for all the good and bad that is.
hey mel I just want to say that dog farts are soooo more disgusting than human farts bc I know for a fact bc my twin sister has a dog and she is a rescued dog and I babysit it for my twin sister bc it is sooo glued onto me bc she loves me so much that I can not get away from her. anyway getting back to this gaming journos going on strike and I think that if the people who works for the company who dont want to get paid for the company then they should work at somewhere else and stop being babies and stop going on strike  ok mel. anyway I just want to say bout this topic of this gaming strike issue  ok mel. anyway hope you have a great evening at home with your pets and have a good night. also have a great week at home with your pets and have a great weekend with your mother too  ok mel.
I have yet to meet a single gamer that gives a crap about what most journalists think.
holy moly!!! 22.6k subscribers chicky!!!!!
fire them all. a good chance to clean house and hire somebody who can write.dont ever donate to people who  at their own discretion  walked away from a paying job. its their choice. you made the choice  you live with the consequences. its called being an adult.
these people and politicians are the only groups of people along with hollywood and comics I enjoy losing their jobs.
title   gaming journos go on strike. me   and nothing of value was lost.
thank God. now there s room for actual gamers to talk about games
wont anybody think of the gaming urinalists
the term  journalist  has become synonymous with  leftist activist .
melonie I recommend sabaton they make outstanding songs .
I never even noticed they was on strike. guess it doesnt matter to me. sometimes you gotta hit reset.
as a gamer  ive always hated game critics and game journalists... we dont need themwe gamers ourselves are trained to be perfect analyzers and many other things via the game we play in life...
gaming journos on strike  oh no...........anyways nice weather we are having today.
have youread Jesus calling  its one of those daily devotionals and it can be so powerful. when I was reading it  there were days where what I read manifested in my day and I was like wow.
the job of a journalist is to report on news  not to make the news. it is not their job to interfere with  in this case  the game developers. I dont know who decided that urinalists should dictate what can and cannot be created. I dont feel any sympathy towards these hacks who seem to be able to dictate their woke agendas to anyone developing games.
oh no the journos are on strike. what am I gonna do without botched reviews
chris hemsworth openly said that having to do topless scenes as thor made him feel a bit uncomfortable. nobody cares  but as soon as a virtual women in a game is attractive then all of a sudden there s an issue as though women are the only ones who get objectified in media. imagine if men started campaigning to make the next super man 5  overweight and balding. xd
gaming journos   go on strike me   and nothing of value was lost .
I cant multistream per twitches contract  so I gotta go all or nothing on one or the other
@melonie mac go boom  ah  if you already have a contract with twitch  no reason to do youtube streaming then  if youtube ever gets their shit together there may be a reason to use it but it honestly seems like that will never happen.
english voice over actors too
why do they keep paying for those writers  there are thousands of writers out there that would happily do commissioned work and then they wouldn t have to deal with this bs. then maybe they could get rid of all the wokeness too.
Im trying to transition into a carnivore diet  unfortunately I have an extremely limited budget right now and I do factory work so long hours  6 days a week and very labor intensive. Im having difficulty affording enough meat to get through the week  also very little time to cook as I only get 1 day off  got any tips
maybe megan rapinoe can negotiate for them!
all the corporations and private donors need to do is not cave in. they can bleed their staff dry and hire on people that actually play games  have fun  and show their enthusiasm in articles. for once  Im totally against the people on strike. the people striking have been actively ruining my favorite publications for over ten years.
good  I hope they permanently stay on strike  and then they can be replaced with some actual journalists that have respect for the gaming industry. wishful thinking I suppose lol
journalism is the production and the distribution of reports on the interaction of events   facts and idea s that are the news of the day and that inform society to at least some degree. it is not as we see today based on personal ideology.
daisy light sour cream has more carbs than daisy normal sour cream.
lmao xdddd loved the  ............... okboomer
fire them all ontop of the game devs that also cater to them
we love ya girl!!!!booooom!
instead of beef jerky  have you thought about either going with or sending your mister out deer hunting  venison beats beef in everything. if youre into this carnivore diet I promise it ll save you money but you d need another full dedicated freezer. Im in ky  1 deer tag is  60 1 buck and 2 doe  get another ticket but no more than 1 buck a year  its 2 doe. but if just you or you and your husband let s say could get 6 deer. thats like most of an annual consumption of venison  boom. costs cut. if youre sad about deer  thats why you use a bottleneck cartridge bolt-action scoped rifle and go for head or heart. lights out  you have meat. saved me a lot of money thats for sure  and its a meat thats good for you  no bad cholesterol like pork.
companies should be required to offer health insurance to their employees if we re not going to move to a universal healthcare system in the us. healthcare is way too expensive and unaffordable for the average american and nobody should have to empty their savings account simply because they got cancer or some other illness
gaming jours just either rewrite what the companies give them for propaganda  or randomly throw shade for woke reasons on good titles. hard to really call any of that  journalism .... high school yearbook kids can do better.
wow 5000 subs since I subscribed. rising youtube star!
pc gamer and pro gamer were real game magazines. I dont know what these other magazines are  but when they care more about woke social justice bs  and hardly any thing about the games  then they shouldn t be called game magazines.
jalopnik is sort of a mash of jalopy and beatnik  and is aimed at the car crowd. they ve gone downhill in recent years.
haven t they heard that going on strike is terrorism now   they should have their bank accounts frozen and their pets and children removed from their custody.
I did the most protestant thing ever.  I gave up olives for lent.  I hate olives.happy lent for those who partake
good jobalways blame the pets.
I dont have a mister at the moment  but I want to learn to hunt so I can get my own deer haha!
@melonie mac go boom  I darn  I thought you were married for some reason  or engaged... my bad.I hunted from 10-16  returned in 2019  Ive killed 3 bucks and 2 doe in 3 seasons. had to buy another freezer.
@melonie mac go boom  ok your I got divorced video popped up in my home page. my bad  Im new here
journos on strike.....the fact that these people are called  journalist  in the first place  is wrong. I would find it acceptable if they were called  writers   considering they make up stories about games they didn t or barely play  interlaced with a bit of woke fantasy  in order to be in lock step with the narrative.....  also if there are no barrels with fire in it or not at least a few burning tires  its not a strike picket. usually there is at least something burning  well  here in belgium anyhow...
as a fellow Christian and a transgirl  I get so much crap for doing the same thing of keeping up on my Bible study  etc. but it does the same for me. it helps with all the stress and keeping me centered.
lets be honest there s not any real journalists anywhere nowadays in any industry apart from a few independent people
its a shame that we have to take a break from getting to read in-depth pulitzer-level pieces from kotaku on the toxic masculinity and transphobia of anyone who likes to play the sims with exclusively heterosexual relationships.now Im going to go eat a slab of beef slathered in hot sauce.
gaming journos go on strike . finally  some good news in 2022. hopefully this strike is permanent. less clowns in the industry.
im not old enough to have grown up reading kotaku etc. the only people who still read it are older feminist millenials. its a shame that companies still take them seriously and cave to them. most young people get gaming news from youtube. I dont really have anything against them striking though. workers should always prioritize their self interest. the job of the employee is always to get away with paying their workers as little as possible for as much work as possible. workers should therefore take the polar opposite position.
youre a journalist... a dime a dozen liberal arts major.  fire them all and there s other 20 year olds looking to move out of their mother s basements.
they say dogs turn out just like their owners. she farts  then just stands there with a look thatsays  yeah I farted.. what the fluff you gonna do about it    lmao.
shit  I hope they are on permanent strike.they actually think people need them.thats the scary part.
let s hope its forever
maybe with all that extra time they can play some video games
your amazing!!
the poor gaming journos got their metroid dread journo mode  and that developer from old God of war who cried about it  4 months too late.
gahhh Imake jokes about g-fuel  raid  magic spoon  hyelix sleep  skill share all sponsoring everyone but me on all my live streams so this is my day 1 of commenting on your videos till gfuel notices me lmfao.
you mean we may get honest unbiased reviews of games
a game journo strike would be a public service. lol
commenting to feed the algorithm ...  and for the goat tower.
but... Im not a boomer!  am I still allowed here
game journos ho on strike and...no one notices because nothing of value is lost.
they start at  50k
did that actually happen
not a single tear was shed.
cant decide whose cuter you or shoeonhead
this is just devastating news...
is that dark angel lara on your shoulder
s-b-d   doggie-style  lmao
food dehydrator. for that dry humor.
boooom
I think the most appropriate place for a dog fart is in a video about games journalists
time to invest in degrees a for the dog
these so called  gamer journos  spend more time writing about politics than about games!let them go broke!!
oh no! people that I refuse to read are on strike .... anyway
gaming journos on strike and omg my dog farted.... well since the journos opinions are literal dog farts I d say that was perfect timing
they should just not re-new there contracts! I think only 10 to 20   of people who play games have the same outlook on life as  90 of these journos!!! I think most of us just go to content creators for advice or reviews of games.
would be nice to see everyone dropped  the gaming media needs a clean slate.
I would tell these activist to kick rocks especially since they got the same deal the onion got.
what s up  you forget about streaming over here  Im walkin  here
oh no  whatever will we do without our game journalists telling us gamers that we re a constant problem for x  y  z reasons ... anyway..
oh no! moving on...
also melonie did u hear nintendo gettin  classic tomb raider lara craft well sorta
next stop are the homeless shelters. then they will have no choice but too act respectful and un-entitled as they must beg for money and be forced too humble themselves as they survive.
I didn t even know gaming journos were on strike until today. they are that irrelevant to me.
jalopnik is car related.
oh no! I hope they never ever come out of the strike. I hope they get striked for real and lose their useless jobs. maybe they can learn to code
sure melonie blames the dog lol.
those are not real journalists. no one will be missed.
I take being called a boomer as a compliment  much better than being called a millennial
they have a woke agenda.
didn t notice  didn t care. if it wasn t for the quatering on twitter I wouldnt have cared at all
batman is good. youre going to like it
I d rather be a part of  boom squad  or  boom gang  than  boomer   I am your age
jalopnik is the only tolerable one of the bunch. that is an automotive site. they still get cringy sometimes too
my dog gave me both barrels in the face last night. oh the stink.
jolopnik  deal with cars. from  jalopy  - a clunker.
I love uuuu
journalist   union   good faith  pick 0 and continue...
maybe they should learn how to code.
and nothing of value was lost.
go broke   and learn to 0d
msn messenger!! tell us your a minI boomer without telling us your a minI boomer
Im using it as our own word  I dunno why it triggers a couple of y all so bad
bahahaha!
ya beat me to it!
that made me laugh. thank you.
do not know if you like seafood  but if you do try dehydrating scallops.  ummy!!
game journos on strike  ha! ha ha! thats some funny shit right there! pardonthe language.
I wish they would go on strike forever.
and  almost  nothing of value was lost....
honestly nothing of value is lost. Ive been just waiting for these activists Im not calling them journalists because they aren t. if these companies wanted they can just say  okay here s your severance package. bye!  and hire replacements for cheaper and just ignore the idiotic demands these bums made.
chicka... licka... bam  bam... lol
they need to get rid all the workers  activists . they dont really do what they are being paid for they are there for activism.
puppy!!!!
whatever floats your goat

oh no!!!!anyway...
they should all just learn to code.
canthe woke journalist now be fired and give their jobs to older useful gamer journalists.
proud boomer right here. ok  lol
176 and 63kg is not ripped. thats an eating disorder...
blamed it on the dog. not cool.
and nothing of value was lost
thank God! like seriously  to all striking game urinialists  go away  stay away  you will never be missed.
her parents myst hate her by naming her jezebel
oh nooooo.. who will lecture us about lack of representation in gaming  over-representation in gaming  cultural appropriation in gaming   sexism  in gaming  boob armor in gaming  white-washing in gaming  alphabet people in gaming..... they are the only ones that can do all that  and more  without even playing the games!
my dog farts on me all the time. itstinks so bad! Im like  really  take care of them  feed them good  pet on them and what do they do  fart right on top of you.  p.s. check out gameranx for solid game reviews.
who cares what they want  I dont go to their sites.
the world would be better without most game journo s...I go to actual gamers for game reviews.
suuuurrreeee blame it on the dog
hey  melonie- is the carnivore diet literally just meat   do you eat salads and fruits  - I need to fix my diet
never heard of them. why is transgerder surgery not considered cosmetic
there hasn t been gaming  journalism  since egm and nintendo power were relevant. unless you look back fondly on rubbing one out to tifa s big mommy milkers circa 1998  I dont want to humor your thoughts on the game industry in general.
lol! aren t these companies failing  the idiots are killing their own jobs. fantastic!
sex change paid by employers wow and I thought we where socialist here in denmark but write some bad hit piece articles in america and now you think you can expect up to a 35000  bonus ngl we are abit lefty here but I dont think we could afford that must be a really rich company getting alot of profit from those kotaku hit pieces
screw them...and fire them. unions were designed to help protect from unsafe work environments. other than that it is a free market.
I only stopped by to say  who cares
just hire scabs  thay cant be worse.
also why should they pay for someone s trans costs... did they force them to do it   or did they just do it to get more attention
slava ukraini
yay before I even watch.  gamming journos are dumb.
dont care. kick rocks and play on the highway.
meat  eggs  and dairy if you cantolerate it  though I d advise against milk because of the carb content . its basically keto except no veggies  only animal products. best health of my life eating this way. if you watch my misinformation video I share a lot more about how it helped me
@melonie mac go boom  thanks so much!- God bless
I love my dogs  but their gas should be labeled as weapons of mass destruction.
ha  ha  ha  ha!they honestly believe were going to miss their toxic istophobian bullshit
booooooooooommmm!!!dont blame the dog for your farts! bad  bad melanie! wow! it makes me wish I was a games journalist. slack around  complain about nonsense and earn well
bye  felicia.
good  I hope they continue striking forever  good riddance.
may I recommend that you do something with your voice  it almost sounds like constant vocal fry. Im not trying to be mean. I hope youread this and it can help you a little. as it is I am struggling to watch a full video. maybe other people feel the same  I dont know. please spare me any white knight comments. you are not needed here.
sorry you dont like my voice. some people dont like it  and thats ok  but I am not going to change the way I naturally talk lol
@melonie mac go boom  I wasn t asking you to change yourself  that wasn t my intention. you know how people have  stage voices  or talk differently when performing  I figured that could be what was happening. if you naturally talk that way  I apologize. again  I didn t mean to offend or suggest you should change to suit me. I wish you all the success in the world.
@melonie mac go boom  also  thanks for being polite in your response. most people in the comments have forgotten that art.
