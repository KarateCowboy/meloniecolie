Ive said it before and I ll say it again. we dont have a  toxic fan  problem  we have a  toxic creator  problem. some creators seem to be under the impression that we must like whatever they create  and if we dont  we are the problem. no. we are the customers. its their job to create what we like  not the other way around.
I really  really hope this turns out well.  I am pretty jaded these days about anything comic related.  we ve been screwed over so much.  red sonja is my favorite character  followed by wonder woman.  I hope in the movie she s every bit the badass from the comic. also  give her the chain mail bikini. just send it.
the director is attached to solomon kane  2009   ash v evil dead  2015-2016   the terminal list  2022   reacher  2022   and altered carbon  2020  to name a few. she sounds somewhat based to me which is excellent!
savage  dark  shallow  debauched  bloody  heroic. this is the world of red sonja
I d be very interested in watching red sonja if they may it gritty. when my friends and I watched the original film we mocked it the entire way through  but later we found ourselves humming the theme and wanting to rewatch scenes. after many years its now one of my favorite old sword   sorcery films.
I seriously hope this is the case. red sonja is such a cool character  if she s done the way she was intended to be.
man this project has been  in production  for so long  I remember when rose mcgowan was attached to the part.
Im sold due to the new director.  Ive seen solomon kane  and it is a gorgeous movie.  very true to robert e. howard stories.  the only complaint is they kept removing the hat  due to the studio didn t want to look like copying hugh jackman s van helsing.
matilda lutz was in revenge  which was comically unrealistic in a completely entertaining way. definitely worth the watch.
with bridget you could see the anger. almost feel it. the way she handles thatsword the way she plays that character amazing. no one else would have pulled it off like her.
as a person that was mega into competitive bodybuilding ..and now competitive mma fighting and weight drops....you have the whole keto carnivore pegged! .....u make great motivation.......I love it keep on killing it!!
thank you cromm! there just might be a chance here to make a true and killer  much wanted red sonja flick!!!!!!!love the choice of actress and director. there is hope...
thats good news   good to see you melonie
agreed on the buffing up front. give her a bit of anavar  since its kinda the  girly  steroid  and have her doing some full body workouts focusing on heavy mechanical tension  eccentric stretching  and occlusion. you can put on noticable mass in weeks.
so I had to look her up she was in the movie rings dont remember if I saw it I think it was the 3rd ring movie but she s apparently an italian model which I agree with you I think she has the look also a little jelly of that minI fridge amazing video youre the best melonie
the time is ripe for a good sword and sorcery movie!
ayyy  thats promissing. at first I thought they just got forced to recast the role by force of the schedule conflict  but the director also got changed  hmm  normally Im pretty skeptical of anything coming from hollywood  call this conditioning  but now Im more curious and hopeful. this might be the first redhead in a good while to not be tossed into the representation meat grinder. us redhead fans have to really  count our blessings   both in fiction and irl
great video  thank you. very glad to hear this is dodging the entertainment agenda.
hey mel. just watched you all on the drinkers live stream. got you and star wars girl subbed now. hope to see you all with drinker and mauler more. you all had me dying . stay strong in the fight. I will be joining in soon. p.s.  go watch cobra kaI  but reacher definitely watch first
melonie mac you are nice on the eyes for me and after a tough day at work I wholeheartedly thank you for that.
they think they are writing gospels or something
entertainment used to made by creatives  now they re influencers  aka propagandists.
as a matter of fact  they can do what they like as well. if it is good  we will like it. the problem is that they do no accept that they failed to produce something we like
nicely said.
@spartan300  who are you talking to
amen.
@john mckenzie  you
check out chainsaw man  jujutsu kaisen  and solo leveling they are some of my favorite comics  manga  in recent years.
@delevingne  nice! I will check these out. I enjoy manga for the most part  even if its read backwards
bro my favorite female hero is witchblade and I dread the day they decide to do a live action movie of that
@reggielacey 223  isn t itsad that these days when they  adapt  our favorite chars to big screen  our first thought is    holy shit  please  no
@reggielacey 223  Im pretty sure they already did a live action movie of switchblade. it just didn t have a big budget.
based take.
she hulk right
@spartan300  how on earth does your reply relate in any way to what I wrote
you are right. disagreeing with someone s choices or opinions does not make one  toxic.  yet another example of a misappropriate use of a word as I fulminated against in my previous post.
its fan-baiting  a form of marketing used by producers  film studios  and actors  with the intent of exciting artificial controversy  garnering publicity  and explaining away the negative reviews of a new and often highly anticipated production. its something they do deliberately to make sure that anyone who dares criticises it can be attacked on the basis of some stupid sjw excuses like  racism    misogyny    transphobia   etc rather than have to address the obvious flaws in their projects and at the same time ensuring increased viewership from people who feel the need to demonstrate how they re aren t  racist    misogynist   etc
@moreau cl ment  true enough  they can make whatever they like. but its also their job to make things the costumers will buy frequently so they make money  so if they aren t making things a majority of the customers like then they re failing to do their job properly.
@archdemondemiurge  thats the one of the greatest challenges of an artist in this field to create a balance of expression their vision and selling it. this is why fine art is really the purest art as its ultimately just pure expression without and audience in mind.
we have both problems. fans are super toxic as well. angry swarm cheering on hating things together. looking through reddit to find new things to hate. fo on youtube out billion dislakes! yay! people even make extensions for chrome to bring back dislikes display. because they want to feel bbeing part of this agnry mob.  oh yeahhh look how much we hate this things oh yeahhh we need more videos explaining exactly why rings of power is trash oh yeahhh . people love hating things together. and creators love give them every reason to do so.
the client is always right . some people like the she hulk writers doesnt give a f and shit on this quote nowadays.
calling them creators is giving them more credit than they re due  they re appropriaters. they take other people s work and such the soul right out.
solomon kane was definitely bad tho.
good  reacher was great as was the terminal list
I fucking love solomon kane  underatted film.
@samuel br mont  wrong
woah I really liked soloman kane! that gives me hope.
since no one else is saying anything about it  I ll say that ash vs evil dead was a great series  so that combined with terminal list  and reacher is good news.
@geeebuttersnap  you took the words right out of my mouth - ash vs evil dead was hilarious! and soooooo unbelievably gory and bloody... campy  but I loved it!
great description but I am afraid we wont see anything like it in the movie.
same here.  I thought this was dead.  wait and see how faithful they make it.  Im guessing she wont be rockin  a metal bikinI but hopefully its at least fun to watch.
@ brandon I hate to break it to you but she doesnt has free reign  quess who is also attached to this movie  gail simone. who also has been hinting about this movie for quite some time. so im pretty sure this going to be the rebooted gail simone red sonja  which means it going to be utter trash.
I like the chosen actress because of that movie where she survived the fall and assault from 3 guys. I just hope they will somewhat modernize and yet sexy the costume like what they did with the wonder woman costume of gal gadot.
always think whenever the name matilda is said the person saying itshould do their best jean reno impersonation.
lol  I first came across you through a clip of you eating butter to rolling blue parody. then found more out about you through twitter to which I follow for mainly youtube content creator updates. very refreshing to see a youtube creator with your views. as a geek and a Christian with middle right political views with an affinity for art and gaming  I am definitely interested in hearing your takes on current states of media and gaming. I follow a lot of youtube creators despite their differing views  for their media content -but this is a breath of fresh air.  you definitely blow away stereotypes. and it all started with eating butter and fitness  lol
cult I think would be more appropriate to call them but religion works as well. I really hope the red sonja is going to be something worth watching now  she is one of my favorite all time  characters
oh dang I feel like I haven t seen content from you in years and its super cool that I found this channel! great video  instant sub
the drinker s after hours show that you mentioned is how I discovered you  just yesterday actually . Im glad I found your channel  and anyone who isn t yet a fan of the drinker needs to be! lol
red sonja has be to strong and look the part. I really hope they do a better job with that than they did with the lady from prey. and melonie needs her gym motivation glad I was able to help you find a video topic  too.
honestly Im looking forward to the red sonia movie more now then before
I am glad! I am looking forward to watching red sonja in the theater. the red-haired she-devil with a sword casting is very much approved by me! I love you millennium pictures. I am glad that michael jackson-looking actress has bowed out. am watching  revenge  now for the fourth time! I cant wait!
best thing about all ur content is that you say everything that most people that are all up in your comments only wished they could say keep it goin !
I loved the solomon kane movie  it was grossly underrated.
liked the red sonja with brigitte nielsen from 1984. co-starring arnold schwarzenegger back when he was still pretty buff. she was not a natural red head but played the role very well. tall and strong  a great actress  she was perfect for the role. that movie was awesome. hoping for that type of quality with this new attempt and this current actress. happy for taking out the unnecessary race swapping on this current movie. praying for a well written story with great acting and awesome production value overall. we need this. also  a strong female lead is what is needed  not some woke version which makes women appear whiny  bitchy  and weak. if anyone seen the movie from back in the 80s  that is a strong female role. that is what it looks like. I loved that. so hoping that this version of red sonja brings that back. I want this to be the beginning of returning to what makes people want to see a movie again.
so glad I found your channel  I totally agree with you about she-hulk.
this is good  they re not erasing the red heads. I bursted out laughing when you said this.
this could end poorly still but at least it definitely has a much better chance of being good.solomon kane is underrated as fuck. as for woke culture I think scam cult or infection are better descriptions.
when there is red sonja from a creator named robert e. howard  writer roy thomas and the art by barry windsor-smith since I saw a comic poster of her in a ancient recent modern history art including spider-man as a crossover in a different cover with colored pencils and markers  then there is a movie and a remake  and someday a women named gail simone who is an inspirational fan of red sonja from an article websites says she plans making a video game version of red sonja. unlike the board game which sucks.
I got excited for a heartbeat  then I realized they were adapting gale simones 2013 run...
youre absolutely right about everyone being religious  even if they think they aren t. I consider myself agnostic  I can neither prove nor deny the existence of a God or other deity  but I have my own rituals and habits to honor the death  since I cant explain what comes after death scientifically  and thats really all we have as humans...
revenge was a pretty good action thriller thatstarred matilda lutz.
so glad to see that a character thatso many love is escaping the snare of wokeness while I personally never heard of red sonja till now Im just glad that we seem to be finally breaking out of the woke trap little by little and now let s hope its lara croft s turn soon to break out of the woke trap when the embracer group deal closes sometime next month
yes  you are right. wrong approach by bassett  wrong actress as sonja  gail is involved  costumes and set look cheap. doomed to fail.
thank you  I knew she looked familiar!
@ wingI wish that was true  but the director doesnt has free reign and gail simone has creatively influence. so im pretty sure we get here hosed down rebooted version.
@afca nsf  if the next game doesnt do well then Im pretty sure they would turn to someone else for the creative direction of the following games and hopefully that person actually cares and respects both lara croft and her past as a tomb raider
what if they made black panther white  you would love that.
@mandosaur  no I wouldn t cuz it would be a major change to a well established character the reason why I said what I said is because the new director hired an actress that looks more like the character of red sonja to make it feel more authentic cuz sonja is a redhead and the new actress is a natural redhead so I dont know where you got the idea that I would want someone like black panther who is a well established black superhero to be changed to a white dude cuz race swapping of a character of any kind no matter who they are to me feels insulting to the original source material.
I would love to hear your thoughts on she-hulk. sounds like they re relying more on future teasers  easter eggs  and surprise cameos instead of letting the character stand on out her own two feet.
red sonja seems to be course correcting... do you think they will keep the she-devil bikinI look or update her armour to something more realistic
we have to support this movie.
loved you on drinker s stream  ma am!  eating sticks of butter !  boss lady!  new sub.  keep on keeping on!
good news. Imight be excited to see it
please do a she-hulk analysis.  I expect your take on it would be gold.
good video and good news. and hey  I know whatley. I really hope it doesnt go woke
and here I am reverting to lloyd Christmas mode so youre tellin  me there s a chance
solomon kane was a decent film. highly recommend if you haven t watched it.  optimistic about this film.
sonja probably still wont have the chainmail bikinI costume  because  times have changed
its def a start. let s hope this gathers momentum and we begin to shut out the woke clout that plagues everything.
I think she will do really well!
Im still remaining cautious as Ive heard gail simones name being thrown around lately for the story
red sonia s is pure awesomeness I remember seeing the movie long time ago or was  thatsheena queen of the jungle I cant remember anyway they did have a red sonia movie I remember it was a long time ago and that movie was boss
Im not going to say anything about this new up-and-coming red sonia movie until I see it. Im a big fan of the sword and sandal movies of the  80s  but with today s church of woke ruling hollywood and entertainment I can only say  wait and see.
would love to see a video from you on she hulk.
I remember bridget nielsen portrayed red sonja
well its a step in the right direction I suppose.  now if they could cast an actress with arms bigger than spaghettI noodles and a chest that doesnt resemble an ironing board we would be set.
I still wont believe this isn t woke   after all   its still coming out of hollywood.  let s see if they put her in her trademark chain mail string bikini.            edit   solomon kane wasn t woke at all   so   if its the same director doing this one   there s hope yet.
I hope it turns out great
she s already done two video on topic of she hulk. first was on trailer. second saying looks like she hulk will be m she u
Im not looking for realistic from comics  so I hope not.
unfortunately you are right.
thats good news hopefully another character survives the woke mob
wonder if she will keep her iconic costume
what are the odds red actually gets to wear a battle bikinI on screen
they will problably cut her hair really short  dye it blond and call the movie  karen with a sword   wich will not deviate that much from the original  if you think about it...
this was interesting to watch
robert e. howard  one the greatest american writers of the 20th century. I sincerely hope this new film will honor part of his legacy.
red sonja is not woked out - me  is directed by the guy who did silent hill revelation - me
damn! I didn t know red sonja was a thing! please let it be good!!!!
thats a good news!I have seen the movie with her  she s super pretty and feminine!
I hope its good mel!
though I would have preferred someone taller and more athletic  like ragna ragnars  6 2  veteran of vikings and icelandic olympic swimmer--who was my first choice  though at 37 or 38 she s a bit long in tooth --or 6 1  frida gustavsson  swedish     current star of vikings valhalla  or even 6 3  aussie elizabeth debickI  golden alien queen in guardians of the galaxy 2   that having been said  Ive watched the trailer for  revenge  which starred matilda and she is a believable badass in it  gotta watch that whole flick  and  after hitting the gym for a few months I think she s capable of embodying the athleticism  sass  and spirit of the she-demon with a sword.
didn t even know red sonja was wokealsored sonja  from the 2 movies in the 80s and the hentaI is woke
good news!m. j. bassett a good director and showrunner solomon kane 2009reacher the terminal list ash vs. the evil dead strike backhowever he has directed and written movies of questionable quality such as silent hill  revelation  a terrible sequel to the much better 2005 2006 silent hill movie adaptation inside man  most wanted  a okay straight to video   straight to streaming sequel to the denzel washington movie from 2006 rogue  2020  action thriller starring megan fox as a mercenary
I think you are also a good candidate for red sonja role.....
keep em  comin
if conan can wear a skimpy like loincloth then red sonja better be allowed to wear the chainmail bikini
huh  and I was just saying a few days ago to someone that they were messing up red sonja. am I gonna have to eat my hat  I still kinda doubt it
there is still hope for this movie not to be a shitstorm ... fingers crossed.
matilda lutz did  revenge  - she ll do fine as red sonja.
the key test is whether they have the guts to do the chainmail bikini. in other eras  that wouldn t have mattered so much but in our time  its a litmus test.
no.
0.
good  the erasure of red haired characters from movies has been one of the most blatantly discriminatory bs Ive seen in my life. glad she s being played by a ginger rather than an anagram  wonder if she ll have the build though  I d like to see a red sonja do the same thing with her body that chris hemsworth did for thor.
lutz is 5 6 .  it will be interesting to see if she can pull this one off.
lutz was amazing in  revenge . she ll do great as red sonja -- I just hope they wont give her thatstereotypical side-shave or have one of those activist writers.
actually there is already a post of her first look as the character
I d like to see a new universe where conan  red sonja  solomon and kull all exist  and crossover
Im confused  miss go boom... you said that you liked seeing the  fit thicc  feminine figure on screen  but you immediately afterward said that that is not your own body type. I have it on good authority that you can only appreciate a film if its the cinematic equivalent of holding up a mirror.  God bless!
hImelonie I just wanted stop by tosay .I wanted to wish you to have wonderful weekend with your family I always enjoy seeing your videos thatu bring of wonderful thoughts opionstakecare melonie
in case no one has mentioned this yet  the spiderman picture is mary jane watson as red sonja  not red sonja herself.
karen gillan should been the new red sonja.
this is actually a female character I care about unlike she hulk or scarlet witch. there s a huge chance they could fuck her up but now I have hope. I suppose this means they can say  they tried  to make a  diverse  casting choice and now are free to actual do a respectable casting.
so  they cancel conan  but do a solo red sonja they got to squeeze the woke in  somewhere  I suppose.
why this girl does not have an onlyfans is beyond me
I loved red sonja so much more than conan.
great video!
solemn kane was a good movie.  Im more hopeful now that this might actually wind up being a decent movie.
I just finished watching a midnight s edge video on this...and while the casting change is promising  and the director is promising...most of the rest of the stuff is still pretty bad.  and I think the worst of it is the fact that the version of red sonja that this movie is going to be based on seems like is going to be the gail simone version  if you dont know who gail simone is... google her  you wont like her   at the very least we know that one of the characters in this movie  that they have announced an actress to play this part  is red sonja s sister ... which was created by gail simone.
its gonna be tough filling shoes of original actor from old movie. I think she s the best as she is the only red sonja! haha
listening to watching woke content vs. going to church  I think with woke content youre still going  to be preached at but with a lot more guilt and shane and with little to no hope of repentance imo.
07 33  a very strong  muscular woman but still very curvy as well . I call them barbell barbies.
I think youre quite right about religion. modern culture deconstructed God and left a void in our ability to believe. so we find other things to believe in. all sorts of things!
wrong approach by bassett  wrong actress as sonja gail is involved  costumes and set look cheap. doomed to fail.
finally a redhair character casted right. but yet we still have to wait to see if they make another mary sue or not.
20 bucks says she wont be the lead in her own film
you cant just use any woman to play red sonja. you need someone who can actually put on a believable angry face. especially people like rose mcgowan.
chrissie mayr would be a fun red sonja  lol
I think hannah john-kamen wouldve done a good job  and she s caucasian-appearing enough to have passed muster.  I know ive seen matilda in something but blanking on where.hopefully it turns out as impressive as itshould be!  red sonja is an iconic character!  I thought the 80s movie was pretty lame   tho in all fairness  I saw it 30-some-odd yrs ago as a teen  so maybe I need to revisit it as an adult   so yeah  hopefully they do better this time.
for me how they move is more important than what they look like in a picture.  not that her picture is not important but I have a broad range of attractive women that look like they can do the job.  I watch women s sports  -   so when a super capable women moves in a way that doesnt look like an athlete it all seems off.  message to the director  if the actress throws like a girl dont make her throw anything.
@melanie mac go boom  midnight s edge did a 13 minute video showing that red sonja may still be very woke.
still might be woke tripe since they are useing gail simone s reboot of red sonya instead of the original creator robert e. howard characters back story.
great. I have her prime 1 statue. wish it was a real red head but all good
lutz better hit the gym .... hard .... now. but I think she has great potential  read a few comics and go heavy on your martial arts training and you may be a real up n comin nerd star.
step in the right direction  indeed. now let s hope they dont make her a man-hating new wave feminist or sneak in pro-marxist trash.  ... as a red-head  youre damn right we never get representation! all I had was eric stoltz and he s so old now the red is probably burned right outta him. ... kinda curious what you d look like with a red mane.  3
67 days til  halloween
the only issue I have so far is the fact that the actress is not a natural redhead. if the story and acting is good though then I can look past it. Im a huge red sonja fan and so I just really hope they dont screw this up.
sonya did have a deity looking over her so buff isnt all nescarry
I was hopeful for a body builder to be red sonja  and see thatside of strength  but the antI woke is best tho.
if this turns our just decently ok  its enough of a win already...given that these fantasy stuff are already tricky to do well  even without woke crap being put in...
a victory  we can use one... I ll take it!
Im a huge red sonja fan and wasn t planning to see this movie if they went with their woke ideas. so glad to hear they decided to change their mind. I have a pretty big collection of red sonja comics and am back to being excited about this. the woke crowd needs to stop trying to change characters. hopefully they do this movie justice.
I heard solomon kane was good  but that director did silent hill revelations . so I am worried.
there is no chance this is going to be the red sonja fans want to see  the dirctor doesnt has free reign. gail simone is creatively attached to the project  so im pretty sure we get the water down rebooted gail simone version. even when things werent woke they didnt had the stones to do so. of which her previous portrayals and the awfull witchblade serie to my opinion proved.
director said she hates rs origin from comics so she invented her own.
@drtisagita  the comics is not red sonya s  original origin. but you and the director both do not know that or care.
the only similarity between matilda and sonja is red color on her wig.
unfortunately you are right.wrong approach  wrong actress gail is involved  costumes and set look cheap. doomed to fail.
with visual effects now... I dont care what the person who plays the character looks like... make whoever it is look like the character with visual effects.  get an actor who can act and portray the character accurately and I ll be happy.  just dont change the character.  want an  insert whatever you want type of character here    fine.  go write  drawn  make that character the star of their own story.  it is insulting to try to change an already existing character into whatever it is... I dont just mean to the original character s fans.  Imean to the people supposed to be represented by the change.  by not making it its own stand alone story youre saying that they dont deserve such a thing and cant function on their own without the crutch of an already built up body of lore.
good.  and are they going to de-woke the modern comics as well
good to have a character honored in physicality  now we have to see if they will honor sonja in character traits.  if she s then written and directed as a mary sue or a man hater  or spouts modern woke talking points then no.  but we will see.
finaly good news!
I really like the current red sonja comic arc. they show a sexy red sonja without sexualizing her too much if that makes sense. red sonja is shown as an intelligent   empathic but still bad ass female warrior. the chracters in the comic are diverse  but they dont shove the wokeness in your face. I hope there is much blood in the movie and bloodstained red sonja in her steel-bikinI  mocking and joking over the enemys with her sarcastic humor and much of the good ol  crushing the enemies..
yay a victory
I still think they ll swap her out for a poc lol
yo  mel  have you played saints row  a review would be dope af. woke saints row is kinda  a lil  just a tiny bit cringe. tots understand if you cant endure through it tho. seems you got better stuff to cover. lol
let s not kid ourselves hollywood cant help being woke
I think its good to remember two things when considering or reviewing a new show movie 1  if its woke its going to suck.  being woke means the story and characters were created using that ideology and not done in the interest of creating a good story and characters that are believable.   2  not being woke only means the story starts at ground zero.  itstill needs to do the work to create a good story. I dont think its fair to give a show  points  or  credit  simply for not being woke.  I understand why its done in this age of 95  trash coming out of hollywood but not being woke is the absence of bad  not the addition of good.Ive tried finding examples of a woke show movie that was actually good but I could not think of any.   I checked online and I see tons of results for lists of good non-woke content but I didn t see any suggestions for good woke content.   if anybody knows of any please let me know.   I dont think there will be any serious answers coming in    d
I am happy to just read my Bible   most awesome thing ive heard all day. I was wondering if you were a believer  really cool to know and makes me so much more receptive to your message
alicia vikander put the work in  on tr. are you a xena fan
brigitte nielsen of the old red sonya movie had the  look  but really couldn t act for nuts and the movie itself wasn t written at all well.red should look like she could stand her ground against most antagonists and not just be taken out by an exhaled breath.scarlett johannson would be able to pull it off. someone that could really perform this role is kathryn winnick who s a black belt in real life so she would have the athletic combat edge going for her. on the adverse side someone like the old batwoman ruby rose  definitely not. she had no fight style about her and she is one of those that would get rolled by a blowing her over with a sigh.
Ive heard they cancelled batgirl movie all that filming they did is come to nothing.
melonie  didn t you know that you need woke women heroes because deep-down inside you suffer from internalized misogyny  thank goodness these woke movies have come out to provide you the first woman hero  since the last one  for you to identify with!
it would be nice if it turned out great  but soloway the previous director  is still credited as one of the screenwriters of this film. so  sadly  this movie might still suck.
melonie do u like red sonja I think antje traue would have been better choice for red sonja.
my religion is comic books videogames and anime my religion is the joy I get out of those amazing stories and sadly my religion is what gets targeted for corruption the most
yes please.
must be ultra violent and sonja not be portrayed as some sjw as they did with conan. also  itshould not look as if it was shot with old sets and props from xenia
are you kidding  matilda is tiny and flat-chested she has brown hair and olive skin-she has nothing similar to sonja.
@drtisagita  well then no.
it would be in keeping with the  bait n switch  of recent marvel movies
idk man judging a book  movie  tv show  game  etc based on what you perceive as  wokeness  is pretty unhealthy and sounds like hyperparanoia to me. it is okay to enjoy media even if parts of it goes against your personal beliefs.
first off  I dont see that being sick and tired of wokeness in media as being unhealthy or hyper-parnoia.  have you not been paying attention at all over the past 5 or 6 years   all of the disney star wars is woke garbage.  everything marvel since endgame is woke garbage.  as for me Ive been seeing this happen for close to 10 years now.   Ive been watching youtube videos from people like thunderf00t or the amazing atheist about wokeness for a long time now.    side note   Im a Christian  not an atheist.  I just watched his stuff on youtube back then. if you dont see that they are putting this woke ideology into media as a way to change the views and morality of the world  specifically america  then you are blind.  the reason it bothers so many people is that its ever where.  we are sick of hearing it.  we dont want to be preached to when we sit down to watch some entertainment.  its been going on for years and people are sick of it.I seriously suggest you go watch the 1984 interview with the former russian kgb defector yurI bezmenov.   from this 1984 interview he talks about what russia planed to do to america and its clear that its happening right now.   all they had to do was start the corruption decades ago and the mindless idiots who joined the far left continued pushing this for them.  the far left dont even know they are doing it.but go ahead and do the usual thing.  say Im a conspiracy theorist.  that Im paranoid.  that Im a far right racist nazI or whatever else you want to say.  but I do have one question for you in my first message I said I could not find a single woke piece of entertainment thats good.  I searched online but could only find tons of links to pages for things like best non-woke movies after 2018is there an online list that helps me avoid woke movies non woke tv shows to watchsince I couldn t find a single good woke show movie perhaps you can let me know of one       I ll be waiting for your answer.  Im sure you must have a ton of suggestions  right
if anybody knows of any please let me knowa - r - c- a- n- eits progressive  not  woke   as it has gay characters and non-white characters  but these are no better or worse than the white or straight characters  and they are all in service of the story. the plot  acting  artwork and music are all absolutely fantastic. its how you do a  diverse  show well.
@fionalah  having a gay character with an sjw haircut doesnt make something woke.  the same as if a show has a black character doesnt make it woke.   thats an extremely simplistic view of what woke is.  I haven t seen arcane but Ive heard good things about it and also heard its not woke.   I cant verify that myself though but I keep meaning to watch it.  also  progressive is not woke.  the original 1966 star trek was progressive.   everybody no matter what race  gender or even species were treated as equals.   I also dont think being diverse is woke.   again  the original star trek was diverse. an example of woke would be treating a certain race of people unjustly because you think thatsociety has benefited them more than another race.  the same can be done to a certain gender.    the truth is treating a certain race of people differently than everybody else is racism  no matter how much of an excuse you try to spin it with.
@mr_batsu well said I agree with you. I too watched the ex kgb and it is happening like he said.    how to destroy a country from within without going to war.  a must watch. I too just want to sit down and watch entertainment with out stuff being forced down my throat.  I just watched the orville and thats how you do it without being woke. it takes the subject matter without forcing it down your throat and deals with it in away that is tasteful and respectful way. this is why I love the show. hay I could talk for hours about it but I digress. true words you speak     its hard to find someone on the same wavelength its been a true honor to speak with you. also before I go this red sonja it not based on the old red but the 2014 comic soooo mmmmmm I dont have much faith init. but time will tell time will tell. much respect from britain
exactly. wrong approach by bassett  wrong actress as sonja gail simone and soloway are involved  costumes and set look cheap. doomed to fail.
unfortunately sets and costume look exactly like that.
as a secular person  I d like to say I hate the woke state of most entertainment. Im against the race or gender swapping of any character. if you have a problem with a character  dont use them..Im interested in the betterment of humanity. and this woke crap  ain t part of it. stay sane  stay civilized.
no way this wont be woke
I am happy about this there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting a character to look like how they were written to look like it doesnt have to be exact but at least close .
woke privilege  wow that blew my mind off  2020 to present
personally I d have preferred a bigger stronger actress. sonja would need some guns to be realistic in melee with men. a more natural ginger would also have been nice.
people who claim to be non religious find it in other ways  sadly I dont think the correct word is  find . they have it rammed into them via advertising marketing in most cases. sadly psychologists realized that they could create sacred science cults surrounding advertising around products and services   your life is incomplete without this thing we sell . really all religions have basically some for of sacred science that boils down to  you will remain unrewarded unless you do this thing in a certain way . my personal disdain comes from the fact that all my religious family protected my abuser and my nonreligious family had my back  but thats catholics for you. personally I find a strong sense of personal spirituality and dedication to a code of ethics to be more than sufficient to replace religion in my life. God could exist  there is nothing saying there is no multidimensional incorporeal being who s interactions with the universe caused in some part the genesis of life  I just really doubt they would make time for our concerns let alone comprehend them.
can you please start to post your videos on rumble too
oh thank heavens  I love her design as it is. she is a red head changing her race would have killed the whole purpose for the title  ... loved the original movie as a kid so I hope this will be good.
hImelonie  you dont do the verse of the day anymore
I personally  would love to see  this red sonja movie become a massive success ! if they actually  stick to the originale character arch  that made her famous in the first place ... but unfortunately  I have zero faith in anything coming out of hollywood.. channels like melonies are awesome   come from a place of passion  love of franchises like conan and red sonja. but  honestly  I wont let myself get hyped  just for yet another woke  feminist disaster ... hmm maybe I should just get some of the classic books ...
my sympathies for enduring she hulk  I only made it through ep 1  the most antImale crap I have ever seen  just full on hatred of men. I was sad  she was a great character in the 90 s.
even with the casting change  itsounds like this movie might be in development hell. two leads and three directors  yikes.
04 46   in truth  there are only two kinds of people  those who accept dogma and know it  and those who accept dogma and dont know it.  - gk chestertonyou can remove classical religion from the picture. you cannot remove mankind s religious impulses. in the west we are now seeing  for the first time  a generation where a large segment of society was raised without even lip service to religion. they still learned about witch hunts and such and the problems that have occurred with classical religion.  chesterton also said   when a man stops believing in God he doesnt then believe in nothing  he believes anything. . in our generation thatsubstitute is woke  progressive cultural marxism and humanism. what is ironic is that their separation from classical religion makes them all the more vulnerable to its darker parts. in their minds they think of heretic hunts  witch burnings  struggle sessions and purity spirals as things  of religion . then they think to themselves  but  Im not religious  so I am not vulnerable to those things . in doing so  they let down their guard and become all the more prone to them. we see this in the massive human rights abuses of the officially atheistic socialist regimes of the last century and a half  and the collective  irrational groupthink which characterizes them. cancel culture  the reddit hivemind  all irrational groupthink. all said  our generation is living disproof of the claim that as society becomes less religious it will naturally become more rational and scientific.on a lighter note  red monika  not red sonja  is best barely-clothed butt-kicking ginger waifu
plz  you could do this role.
I hate this inevitable descent of the english language through laziness by the misuse of newly coined words such as  woke.   it is not being  woke  or wokeness  to be ethnically or racially inclusive or diverse.  woke  as derived from  being awakened to social injustices within the institutions and systems of society  is specifically in reference to critical race theory  which has been vindicated as a reality by countless examples within government and corporate bodies. just say  red sonja narrows its racial  or ethnic  inclusivity.   yeah  a mouthful I know  but accurate instead of inappropriately stupid and lazy.  I know I fight a losing battle here because its gone too far to be called back  like  karma  being mistakenly applied to your status within this life instead of the next  and many other examples  but I ll keep striving to educate people  as I often do with my friends and associates. and no  no one will ever  nor dare to  punch me out  for being a  word-nazI   which is a misappropriation of  nazI   lol! .
she s not very buff  but looks wise seems appropriate.
hope 2 c u live on twitch soon
3 you mels
tomb raider talk starts at 6 00
youre serious mel
matilda is tiny and flat-chested she has brown hair and olive skin-she has nothing similar to sonja.
exactly.
I have them set to repost there
wrong approach by director  wrong actress as sonja gail simone is involved  costumes and set look cheap. doomed to fail.
maltilda is still yet to work her ass off in the gym to pull off red sonia  but hey  I can see her fit in the role
melonie mac does not like black people  - kanye west
good news for gingers everywhere!
long live all the gingers of the world.
Im prepared to see a race and gender swapped bI red sonja with a red wig  like batwoman.  hope it will be the original red sonja though
thanks Godd they didn t go woke n bblackwash an iconic redhead characterwoooo yea
I think twitter is the church.
will do people hate the 1985 movie
okay  this might be good news. she just needs to hit the gym and put on some muscle. hopefully it does some justice to the original.
there is no way this movie wont be woke. its hollywood... its 2022!!!
hire thinkers with skills  mental toughness  talent  artistic experience  honor  dignity  heart  loyalty   merit  not activists
no more verse of the day
@melonie mac go boom
now I wonder what they will do to her costume   Imean will she wear that chainmail bikinI or worse get covered up completely like netflix did to faye in live action adaption of gayboy beflop oh sorry cowboy bebop.
wheres the butter !
do yourember the cohan reboot
really  also hey your hair
they do like to erase the red heads
red sonja is a badass stronge female character but she is a gorgeous muscled redhead with a revealing outfit. make her that  show her physicality  beauty and strength  not she-hulk karen feminism cringe and you get a hit.
melonie I tagged u in 2 tomb raider movie news aubrey plaza might replace alicia vikander for the new tomb raider movie
meritocracy for the win
its kind of a bad sign when they are playing musical chairs with the director and the lead actress. it needs to be semi-serous like sands of time without the silly ostritch racing side bar. parts of prince of persia were really good.
woah a red head got a job  what the heck
yay they finally didnt hire that one dyslexic casting agent
mel - demonizing whyt ppl     explain plz
and sonja should be a big woman  she battles conan at times and many other men Im sorry but I dont see a 5 6 120 girl doing that
I like hanna  but she was wrong for this role. if matilda preps as hard as alicia vikander did for tr  she can pull it off.
its cool and all but do we need a red sonja remake reboot  just leave the classics alone and create a new character with red hair.
hoorar!
red sonja unwoked  my white male gaze is happy again!
not going with the religion part  however the part with hollywood I agree fully. corrupt people cant teach others to be good.
a good step  but this acter really isn t tall enough.
if hollywood just went back to casting what is accurate then they would do a lot better. there wouldn t be this toxic culture war between the  left  and the  right .
I would like to dissagree with one point. as an atheist I would like to say that we dont replace religion with another extremist belief. we are centrists about most things. I just hope they make sonja a redhead. I liked the first movie casting but needed a better story.
well  the  solomon kane director  part doesnt sound that good really.
humans were made to worship  and they ll do so with something  whether they admit to it or not.
Im not religious at all  and dont accept anything as my  pseudo religion. I agree this woke movement is a religion  or even a cult.
I know when I hear red sonja the first thing I think is black women.....totally not a tall ginger possibly russian female.
dynamite comics are not woke. hahaha!
having a white woman playing a white woman is revolutionary in 2022....this is where we are.
hey  melonie. I just want to tell you that you did a fantastic job with the interview on drinker show earlier today. anyway I just want to tell you that  ok melonie. anyway I think that red sonja is a great comic character and I think thatshe will do just fine like wonder woman in dc movies in future if they make a movie with her in it  ok melonie. anyway also I just want to tell you that I am so happy that people are liking red sonja and not having a dis woke problem with her anymore now thatshe is powerful and looks beautiful and healthy to beat anyone who comes in her way  ok melonie. anyway I just want to tell you that and I just want to tell you that I really love and like your boom videos and I do hope that you continue to bring more videos like this incoming weeks and weekends ahead  ok melonie. anyway hope you have a wonderful and great blessed evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie.
this actress does not have the physique of red sonja at all.
anything other than a redhead white woman playing red sonya would just not make sense so I would say thats a good decision on their part
a twisted religion
just say no to race swapping. I dont want james bond to be black. just like I dont want apollo creed to be chinese  or mulan to be indian.
the actress is a known misandrist
1st
yep... I expected a black girl to get cast as red sonja... they love to replace redheads with black people these days.
still too ethnic. it really bugged them in their butts to hire a really red hair actress. at least someone of germanic irish descent like conan and red sonja are supposed to be.
aww she s not going to be a black and trans them-person with dyed hair and a side-fade
the director identifies as transgender and the script writer identifies as non-binary....this film is dead on arrival  just write the toe tag already.
literally have no idea what you mean by most people being religious whether they admit it or not. I despise religion.
she is total miscast.
you are right. matilda is tiny  flat-chested olive skinned italian girl  with brown hair and cute face. she has nothing similar to sonja.
@drtisagita  exactly. the chick they hired to play her sister is closer to how red sonja should be
