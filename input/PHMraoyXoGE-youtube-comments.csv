make a tr that captures the essense of the originals  exploring with minimal action. in the age of open-world games where people do play to just roam and explore  this should be a no-brainer. and make lara look like lara. anita sarkeesian doesnt buy these games  so dont pander to her.
the reason why every fandom seems to be so negative on their respective franchises is because they ve been screwed too many times to have confidence in anything anymore. everything is woke  everything is being censored  mtx everywhere  there aren t any satisfying endings  and games are no longer even being made well despite being aaa. just look at saint s row.
they are trying so hard to impress the wrong type of  people  or  person  that dont buy nor play video games
I think its time for us to make  freelara a thing because crystal having complete control means they ll ruin the franchise for good
I completely agree. the state of entertainment and especially games is abysmal. ill stick with the older games when they actually had soul in them and were made with passion for the sake of pushing the boundaries. im liking this channel s content ill be subscribing for more.
I hate the direction tr is going. Imiss a lot of the old school  retro games. antthing from ps2 and before are a lot of my favorite games. but with tr ps1 era is my favorite. and yes bring back classic lar croft  sadly I dont think its s going to happen . Im glad your brother is coming over to help with the tv. and hopefully y all can play some retro games while he s there.  great seeing you mel! take it easy and have fun.
its so sad melonie  its honestly so confusing them announcing they  own  it. I thought out of anyone eidos would be more the ones to inherit the ip vs crystal.   embracer saying that crystal will work with  autonomy  does not let us gleam much hope.. also the recent article from eidos montreal s founder that eidos crystal s management under square was a train wreck in slow motion  is it really a good idea to give crystal more power over their ips  we know that crystal basically did what they want with the ip  and the franchise is currently on decline with shadow having a huge budget and making not much profit also whilst not resonating much with og fans or contemporary gamers
crystal dymamics and modern day volition have a lot in common. both find their best ips to have problematic themes and characters that needed completely sanitized of what everyone loved them for.
I can relate to the retro urge. a few years ago I even bought a tube tv  a sega genesis  and then re-collected all of the genesis games I used to have  plus some other randoms I picked up  because of this. there are not very many modern games that I can get hooked into. my interest in new games mostly ended when the xbox 360 cycled out.
the classic lau version of lara croft will be the lara ill always remember... and  laura croft  is what I personally call the survivor version of her  she s not the same person at all in my eyes.I also preferably hope we get good ports to newer gen consoles because I dont trust remasters in 2022
embracer group is known for not interfering with its dev groups. hence why saints rows happened....so long as the crystal dynamics management remains the same things wont really change...
I knew that once they announced another reboot that this series was going to pander to politics rather than staying true to the characters and the lore. I wouldn t have much hope on this one. lol
what a shame hopefully some different studio picks it up at some point and puts the series back on track.
the fact that melonie mentioned tomb raider for the ps1  brought so much joy to my heart. stay amazing  God bless and game on.
what s with making women ugly in everything  seeing women in video games pre 2013 there is an obvious difference its crazy. lara s ps1 legacy still carries on to this day and will carry on forever  its a shame her potential cannot be lived up to today but she will always be iconic to me  as you ve said before there s a reason why survivor lara doesnt have a fraction of the impact classic lara has I was getting excited for you when you started talking about getting a tube tv lol! that does sound very fun and the best way to enjoy your hobby!
thanks for the update  melonie. I first experienced tomb raider on the ps3 with underworld  and liked it very much. I went on to play anniversary and legend when those became available as a trilogy bundle and liked those as well. not that they were perfect  but if crystal dynamics simply returned to this version of lara  I d be ok with it. I can respect that you desire a return to tr as you first experienced it in the classic core games. I gave reboot a chance  even though I was skeptical. although there were occasional teases in parts one and two that cd would make good on their promise that this  origin story  would eventually lead back to the lara we knew from before   the reboot was ultimately a disappointment.  shadow being the worst of the three games imo  since thats the one thatshould have tied it all together  ending with a hardened  seasoned  classic !  lara croft.  for me  the reboot failed on two fronts   1  lara s character  appearance and personality  was unrecognizable  and  2  so was the gameplay   where were the puzzle bosses and dual pistols ! the reboot trilogy was little more than a cynical attempt to leverage one of the most recognizable video game characters of all time to sell something completely different. the ultimate bait-and-switch. if cd does anything other than restore lara s appearance and personality from underworld or before and bring back the old action-adventure guns-n-puzzles format... if I cant look at the character art and instantly know its lara croft without having to be told... hard pass.
I guess embracer bought crystal dynamics  and got tr with it  is the way I understood it. Im so happy that my old school favorite  kyle katarn  is basically done instead of getting rebooted by disney.
I would love to see some retro video game content on your other channel. you mentioned re-reviews of the tomb raider games recently which would be awesome too but videos on any retro games would be great.I didn t realise it back then but the ps1 2 era was the golden age of video games. so many great titles and variety. and none of the grounded realism or wokeness of many modern day western games. games had way more personality and a feeling of fun and didn t seem like soulless  corporate products.
honestly why would you think and hope the fans will ever get  classic lara  back in the era we are now living through  until this vapid creative-free period is well and truly over  dont hold ya breath. just live the best life you can.
I feel your pain.its truly sad how mismanagement of ips  lotr  disney  marvel  got season 7 8  and now tomb raider too...  regularly destroy them utterly.
idk  id rather have half the game with exploration and the other half with action...start of with high tech weapons in fast paced levels then have the rest of the game in isolation in some remote area....
honestly the new lara is great  I just dont think they could recreate the first lara so they should stick with this onr. but I completely agree with the games being more adventurous
the last game shadow of the tomb raider had it done right though. it focused most on puzzles and exploration instead of action. I think if they just expand on it and give players more custom gear options  they can at least let us play how we want to. you cantell they were slowly getting there.
@machta shmacta  the gameplay was fine it was just the story was boring and the main focus should ve been on trinity and really pushed the fact that they could be a major global threat...
we wouldn t be so negative if they d stop taking dumps on everything we love.
@ajpwny  this is true
what they dont get is that we want the original characters back  we dont want a watered down  bland  woke alt version of them.
dont fall for it  every failure is a step forward for their narrative. its called slippery slope.the only solution is to make no compromises.
@r mulo d.  you hater!  sarcasm
@zero saber  their solution is to go back to not making comic book movies.
its been like this for the last 5 years whats new. aaa games for me no longer earn to have that title for there games when they always come out in such a state and buggy mess and broken where some indie games does it better. triple a games are meant to be the cream of the top of games for the highest visuals quality and optimization instead there no better than any other game that comes out that are not big or well know. it feels like there just using the title as a marketing ploy just to sale there games.
this is why y all shouldn t sleep on the rerelease of ys viiI  lacrimosa of dana.dont write it off based on the graphics. the gameplay is lightning fast and fun. the music absolutely pumps. the characters are incredibly likeable. and the game feels so cohesive and culminates in such a bittersweet yet satisfying true ending and secret final boss.its  in my opinion  one of the best video games  not just rpgs  Ive ever played and its coming back... and not enough people are paying attention to what s coming. the aaa industry keeps floundering  but there are still incredible experiences to be found if you dont limit yourself from trying more unique  niche titles. if you like zelda or kingdom hearts  youre likely to enjoy ys.
it makes no sense either despite the faults of video game companies and all the buyouts its still claims to bring in more than hollywood  yet is still treated as a niche hobby....
ikr they dont even play it!
I believe some divisions of crystal dynamics was part of the deal in thatsale  so basically its embracer s ip and crystal dynamics will be the exclusive development team.
I want to see melonie play guitar hero ii.
I would really be interested to see classic tomb raider again I remember seeing tomb raider underworld and not being able to play it I hate that Imissed out on those ps3 games I would like return to form for the tomb raider series because the reboots were fun but they got old really quickly like yeah there was a lot of stuff to do and it was interesting but I still feel like you could do like maybe half reboot style half classic style and make both fans happy like have a hybrid game pretty much of what was good in the reboot series and what was good in the classic series and mix  those two together
that original lara is of her time...I found her bland being like that  but at least by tomb raider 4  she had gotten a deeper character....
as an old tr fan  I actually really enjoyed the reboot tomb raider  especially the last two in the trilogy. I think there s definitely potential for them to coexist. the level of exploration and detail is insane and everywhere you go tells a different story of what happened. all they were missing were lara s acrobatics. if they bring that back and combine with the reboot s world building  we would have the perfect tomb raider experience.
its getting progressively difficult as time goes on. Im finding myself playing older football games like ncaa football 14  madden 2007  and nfl 2k5 just so I can get a good american football experience. ea is the only one who can make a nfl simulation game  and they have no intentions of making a good game any time soon. modern gaming just isn t what it used to be.
just gotta let it fail before change happens.
maybe they should interfere then.
they aren t rebooting tomb raider   their continuing the survivor era. which we just dont know how its going to turn out since the survivor trilogy is nothing like how lara croft or tomb raider is at all.
at this point I have more hope of an indie game developer showing up with a tomb raider clone that is more tomb raider than whatever crystal dynamics craps out.
as soon as I saw the new tomb raider  I swerved. Ive been blackpilled on modern gaming for a while now haha
Imade the mistake of thinking that embracer got the rights for tr away from cd when they bought cd but this isn t the case. I hope and pray that nothing happens with kyle katarn.
embracer is the owner of the new saints row  let thatsink in.
@norman readdis  they got a heaping fresh turd when that reboot came out.
@zeorhymer now imagine a fresh embraser tr game whould look like and as if cd have done lara justice in the reboot anyway.she looks like a reyp victim than the sexy badass she was in the ps1 era.they probably make her spelunking in sewers for extra credit grades in university.
@norman readdis   embracer gave volition free reign to do what they wanted. so that was more of a volition problem.
@machta shmacta sure the ceo of volition think sharkeesian was  right  in 2014. but embracer is a esg company even before the buyout. q ahow does embracer group approach esg sustainability in the last year  2019   we have shaped the foundation on our approach to esg sustainability-matters  going forward  we will continue to secure that it becomes an integral part of our everyday work throughout our global organization. our great people are our greatest asset and thats why we among others things  focus on our people in the esg work. read more about our work on esg sustainability.posted  2020-06-05 .they may give them a  free reign  but its still need to approach the esg score.
thing is this era will never be over. as companies continue to double down on these types of practices  despite sales being in the shitter.
@fire dust  you must be a youngster! I am telling you this current period of wokeism will come to an end. you never heard the phrase  nothing lasts forever   apply it in this case. Im old enough to remember the last two big pushes of wokeism to change the landscape way back in the early 1980s and again in the mid 1990s. the only major difference this time round is the era of the internet and in particular the usage of twitter where most of these battles take place and where major companies have a platform to fall in line and follow the culture created by genz activists packed with woke degrees and diplomas who s main instructions are to destroy maleness ideals and empower womanhood and elevate minority tokenism. for two reasons why it wont ultimately work. 1  its not profitable and our western culture is built on capitalism for the best part. its will take leading brands and companies at different stages to reach the decision to abandonthe woke message depending on how much money they are willing to burn just to stay in the game  2  wokeism files in the face of the unending and must fundamental fact - there is and will only ever be two genders from birth to death. wokeism attempts to relay that there are around 60 different genders at this time you can assign to yourself. such nonsense doesnt sit at the table of a patriarchal household and both sexes are different for a reason. women have children and are enriched with empathy. men are the main breadwinners and put their lives on the line in warzones to protect that very way of life. men cant give birth and women dont fight on the frontline. two realities that wokeism cant break and escape from to change. the end is already coming but it will take a generation measured in time for it to die out. year 2040 is my prediction as its last dying but yes  can come much sooner too.
gawd this woman  has no filter and I love it
never forget this fact crystal dynamics threw tomb raider under the bus when square-enix gave them the avengers game...just like when they threw gex in the attic when they seccured the legacy of kain ip from sillicon knights...just like the time cd left legacy of kain to collect the dust when amy hennig left and eidos gave them tomb raider...
I am in a similar situation in regards to modern games. I am really not a fan of almost anything aaa related these days. I would recommend looking into the smaller studios and indie titles for games. those are where you find the games that are focused on the game and making it fun  and far fewer that are about maximizing profit regardless of quality.
something to note is that embracer group is the one behind the saints row reboot  so they may have made a deal with crystal dynamics on tomb raider  or something to that effect  due to embracers economic downturn in the aftermath of saints row tanking their stock.
I remember saying this would happen. sad to see I was right when I was hoping I d be wrong. rip tomb raider...
the only time Im ok with being called a  boomer  is when melonie mac does her intro
this message was so confusing in the context of publisher developer. didn t crystal dynamics work on the new game regardless  I thought embracer was a publisher  just like square enix was or eidos back in the day. so what exactly  taking control  of the franchise means here.when it comes to crystal having complete freedom though  didn t we learn a while ago from rhianna pratchett that when writing rotr  she was forced to include certain bits about lara s father and possibly make her more  relatable   however Im not sure if it was square pushing for that or cd. but if if was square  there might have been many more decisions made by them which we dont know about.
I would 10 10 purchase one of the fan remakes over anything Christal puts out
girl youre so right! Im also a classic fan and Im devastated about what they have done to lara in the new games.  I want the cool  hot  witty lara back! but Im afraid we have lost her forever.
just finished tr1 tr2 on my original ps1 hardware. had a blast! planning to play through tr3 and tr4 next. enjoy your new tv set up.  tombraiderforever
I see this a problem with many new games and a lot of the times I just play older games because they are not so complicated like newer games and the stories were simple not like they are today.  it is like a movie and its like... let s just get to the action.  tomb raider to me was about puzzle solving and I have always felt it wasn t implicated enough in the reboot.  she was always to me a female version of indiana jones.  I think that is why I liked playing it.  always rewarding  figuring out a puzzle you been stuck on for hours.
iam currently replaying the classics on my ps2  best console ever  and iam trying to make my childhood dream come true and play through them without cheats or walkthroughs ! iam currently at tomb raider 4 and I love them so so much !!! the reboot  tomb raider  games are...ugh.love ya tr content  mal !
oh for fricks sake. I cant believe this is gonna be happen. why cant the game studios just give us what made us love the originals so damn much!
when I need help with tr legend or tr underworld I watch melonie play. seriously. melonie is the best!
no matter the ip or medium...itseems we cant have anything nice anymore. I will never understand the buy it and change it mentality studios have when the base of fans they just bought are clearly against it
in the era we live in  classic lara just cant exist without getting cancelled by cancel culture. they d hound at her and rip her a part until there s nothing left. I think the best way around it would be if they expand on the ability to customize lara s gear and moves. in it  they can give players the choice to have her wear shorts and bring back her acrobatics. maybe even add a workout option to increase her physique in certain areas.
so they gonna get my beloved soul reaver too  was a time that would be good news...in the ancient days
hey melonie I just wanted to tell you that you did a great job with the interview with @nina infinity show last night. anyway you did a great job with it and I was glad to listen and watch you on the show and interview. anyway I just want to make a comment about the tomb raider issue that I do not like where this issue is going with new tomb raider video game but I hope they can change their minds and bring back the old classic tomb raider game and bring back the classic lara croft too so that you and me and everyone who loves classic tomb raider video games can enjoy playing the new game and enjoy the old classic lara croft too  ok melonie. anyway I just wanted to make a comment about this video and I just want to tell you that you did a fantastic job with the interview with nina infinity last night  ok melonie. anyway I hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day today at the gym if you have time to go to the gym today but if not then hope you have a wonderful and great blessed day and evening at home with your pets and have a good night too melonie. anyway God bless you and God bless how well you are doing with this channel melonie. anyway have a great day.
even though I dont play games  I understand how the updating for  modern audiences  by woke companies can destroy established fandoms. I too use an old cathode ray tube television to watch my collection of vhs movies. physical media is a way to preserve entertainment.
why does crystal dynamics sound like the sort of company that would be involved with the whole judgement day event in the terminator world
when you think about it and know the story about these publishers  you kinda realise that it wasn t cd to be blamed on but instead  the other way around.as for the gex bit well  what do youreally wanna put into the 4th game after when ya beaten emperor rez 3 times in a row
ha ha  yes that was my thought too.
with  taking control  bit  its most likely due to squeenix having more control over what cd is allowed to develop or what stuff they must put into the game. now cd was sold off just so square enix could concentrate on metaverse and nfts.
!
based!
you dont play games youre watching vhs movies man from what planet did you come
for me it was the puzzle aspect that kept me playing tomb raider initially starting on the 1st tomb raider on ps1  but as the sequels went on the difficulty or intrigue of the puzzles seemed to get more and more watered down to the point where simply changing the playstyle didnt make up the difference. its strange how all the focus is on her appearance when it or a big part of itshould be on the gameplay as it is well a game. I always likened it to being inside a rubik s cube while playing the game as that was one way I could explain it  the fact that the main character is attractive is a plus sure but while playing the actual game you dont get to see that much of her and what you did get to see was heavily pixelated. me and a friend would take turns playing the game  playing until one of us died or got stuck so bad to give up  which kept things moving some. that being said I know that a lot of the appeal for the game or the character is her looks at the very least to attract some people to play the game so changing things could mess with the recipe and would make itsomething else if you swap out a main ingredient you are essentially making a different dish. lara is essentially a superheroine type so her looks can reflect that be that considered a good or a bad thing as it can be about fantasy.
hey melonie first want to say Im a big hardcore tomb raider fan as well since the beginning and anytime I see you post a video regarding tomb raider Im on it!  lolyea this doesnt sound good  but just have to see what exactly comes out of it weather that will be good or bad will remain to be seenside note  I have a few of those tomb raider statues that you have in the background
thatsucks because a remastered classic tomb raider would make money.
as far as I currently know according to the deal or the sale that is supposedly still happening embrace their group bought the western part of square enix which I think also includes crystal dynamics so I think they were just switching studios Im really confused at it myself to be honest
fyI  tube tv s... you asked about tube tv s being made compact lighter. the closest thing would be a plasma tv monitor. the tech is sort of similar  but its like a crt tube for each pixel. they even have the same image burn-in problem that tube tv s had.
I find it really funny how crystal dynamics demonizes classic lara  because in the classics lara looked very proportional during game play. but then crystal came out with lau and lara was never more sexualized then in those titles  who had her running around in string bikinis and plunging neckline dresses that left nothing to the imagination and made her look like she had  james and the giant peach  sized breasts in anniversary and underworld. the classics were way more reserved than what crystal did  they should take a long look in the mirror before saying anything negative about classic laras image
the mod community is making a new adventure of classic tomb raider. openlara is the best thing to happen for classic tomb raider. openlara got ported to the gameboy advance. that is the most insane thing I ever play as a demo. I hope the mod openlara mod community make a new adventure on the gba. anyways melonie mac keep in eye on openlara projects. because some of them are creating a new adventure with the classic tomb raider engine. they see the fan community mod making open lara. you would think that is more than enough sign in what gamers want. oh well. we have openlara. which the engine is not a emulator. it reprograms new engine that mimics classic tomb raider. so they cant go after openlara. I notice the mod community doing that to a lot of classic games super mario 64  zelda ocarina of time and majora s mask. but why  so that they can make mods and not get sue.
the reboot lara is the final nail in the coffin.also legacy of cain is nothing without amy hennig period.embraer is the owner of the new saints row  let thatsink in.also as a collector  welcome to the retro gaming. there s backlog of games better than today s aaa gaming space.
I was hoping they would bring us the real lara croft after this  prequel trilogy . then again  I also thought they would give us the signature dual weild pistols  but they didn t even do that.
please dont give up on new games just yet. I remember melonie wanting more challenging games. Imay know one game genre for that  historical war games. you want challenge  take a war game that has finland or poland in 1939 with historically accurate force compositions and play it against experienced player who has soviet union or germany. no game balance  no fairness  good luck. among the top publishers of such games are slitherine  paradox  ageod  hps  shrapnel games. look them up and enjoy.
do you guys think that when they have a planning meeting regarding tomb raider  itstarts with words  ok guys  how we can f    up tr and lara croft even more   or  how we can piss off the fans even more  . because thats my whole impression of what Ive seen so far after shadow.
Im not sure what other types of games you are into but the only games that have been keeping my gaming passion alive these last few years are the souls-likes  the good ones .  if you haven t given them a try... I highly recommend. they take a bit of hard work to get into but once they click for you  they are like nothing else on the market. the fromsoft games are the top tier of course. I just cant cope with the lazy garbage the  aaa s  keep putting out lately and most of the games media will shill for it regardless... Ive already seen youtubers  managing expectations  for that gotham knights game because it looks worse than an almost 10 year old batman game.... thats where we re at and I hate it.
re. retro gaming  a friend of mine recently bought a sega mega drive genesis earlier this week - the 16-bit era is where it was at    certainly explains why sonic mania did extremely well - a lot better arguably than most of the 3d sonic games
crystal dynamic did helm the tr legend trilogy. I liked it and I think thats a route they should go. 1  original tr title direct prequel to 2  tr 2 remake and 3  original tr 2 remake sequel.
rip tomb raider  you will be missed
from what I gathered  the embracer deal wasn t going to be effective until the end of this year. unless something happened in between the deal  I speculate this as a psy ops to generate sales for their upcoming game
Im a classic ps1 tr fan and I loved the reboot era too. the only game Im not crazy about is legend. those leakes sound dreadful  but might work for a spinoff. personally  for the next tr game I d like to see a blend of reboot s grit and realism but the gameplay and atmosphere of the ps1 games with classic lara back in action.
classic lara would look at that fan club they re putting in the next one and tell them  you have 10 seconds before I start shooting.  and she d go 1-2-10.
all you have to know is that eidos should not have forsaken core design for crystal dynamics they now look like they really just were standing on the shoulders of core design.
we need to pull a rings of power response to tomb raider. they cant keep destroying previous masterpieces and then blame their failure on the fans. every time you post a video on tr I hope its something good but it always ends up being bad news. I just lost all hope tbh and like you will be replaying the original ones on my ps1.
if the entire game revolved around puzzles it would be so boring...also it needs a good setting maybe some pyramids or antarctia....
@jack straw   oh yeah ofc  I dont mean just puzzles  the shooting and action is an element of the games as well and the locations are an important factor  Imean you could have ancient structures on in the moon or mars like in total recall as long as its done well enough. a decent plot and interactions with characters is welcome too.
I fully expect nothing good to come from the kain universe anymore  unfortunately
I like last tr because you can explore this how-it-is-called village and places around it. you can wander and explore - its what I loved in original tr. exploration and finding items.after recent news Im amazed how this woke mob can destroy even tr - with actual strong independent women in it! - is beyond me   anti-midas team
pretty sure this game was in development at crystal dynamics for awhile now. well before embracer group bought them.
thats what I thought too. so I feel inclined to think this is just a marketing poly to convince their shareholders they can  make a sucksessful tomb raider
big agree! we need our voices heard
@melonie mac go boom  if they drop any trailers  Im sure it will get ratio-ed  if the rumors turn out to be true. thanks for being an honest voice melonie! you rock.
the tr live experience in london is said to be cannon to the unified time line. so  yeah the whole team raider thing is going to happen
embracer is the parent company which owns crystal dynamics  so basically they told cd to do what they want  which is wack
there s still hope.  I hope they learned from top gun.
tomb raider is my favorite video game character and series! fully  agree with you about the ps1 tomb raider games compared to the rest. ps1 was the last console I ever owned then I switched pc games.
I quite enjoyed the reboot games. I wouldn t mind a mix between the new and classics though. maybe classic gameplay with reboot graphics and animations.
youre right to say cd hate classic lara. she was the queen of gaming and transcended the medium to become a mainstream icon  then crystal dynamics crashed the franchise into irrelevancy. the fact they think they re  fixing  her says it all really.also I feel you about playing games less and not liking anything new thats coming out. I haven t really gamed in two years now  then when I do get the urge to play something  I remember the industry is financially exploitative  and borderline abusive to customers. so I end up watching people play discuss the games I used to love on youtube  when gaming was amazing and I loved it. when you brought a game once and that was it  it had all the content and it launched in a playable state with cheat codes adding an extra level of fun. now everything has to be an immersive real life experience that takes itself so seriously its like its trying to win an oscar for screenwriting  and its just boring af.heartbreaking really  gaming will never be the same again.
I had hope that the current tomb raider games would be some type of reworked origin and she would eventually become the badass cool 90s croft. now Im finding myself going back to the core design games to get my lara back.
I only got the first through last revelation on ps3. maybe not the same  but its where I get plenty of the older games. haven t actually been to the store for awhile. heard sony has done something with it when it comes to wallets  so not sure if you cantechnically buy games from the ps3 store even if it is up. would have to check. its where I play dino crisis too  another series thatstarted with a main female protagonist which I swear capcom is squandering to do anything with.
if embracer were the ones who really had all the rights to tr  they should have signed on core design to make new tr games  that is  if core design even exists anymore .
hImelonie happy thursday to you.I always enjoy seeing what you have going on your mind.I agree with you when dropped about playstation takecare melonie
I love this video so much. there needs to be a conceptual place for people to spread the thesis  embrace femininity   very much like the  embrace masculinity  that has happened recently  women and men returning to exactly what they were meant to be  out of a deep desire for honor and conviction.
what cd just announces signifies that a new game is in the works and will announce itsoon. cd has always used such tactics to allure the fans and make them believe something good is cooking this time  which eventually ends being awful. they are terrible liars and the community and fans should stop giving them chances.
the lara being a mentor is a horrible idea  just let me discover things!!
what I find most interesting is that crystal dynamics failed to realize in three tr games that the most fun part of their games was the puzzles and exploring the mysteries. the combat was the worst part. but by the third game  they hardly cared about the puzzles and tried to hurry the players along to the next quick time event and clunky combat set piece.
I remember anna at a bar in san diego dressed as laura croft and some guy came up to her saying that he was working on a tomb raider series for netflix  hoping she would give it a shout out but instead she asked if it was going to be woke. he just walked away.
I think its more interesting that the legacy of kain was actually said by anyone in a professional manner.
I still have my ps vita and that thing has tomb raider 1-4 as well as the psp versions of legend and anniversary along with a bunch of other classic ps1 games as well as some psp ones so its essentially a portable ps1 at this point and crystal dynamics is trying so hard to kill off both classic and lau lara cuz they know thatsurvivor lara just doesnt have as much staying power compared to them as people are already somewhat sick of survivor lara at this point.
is now the owner of these games and the controller of the gameplay and personal data related to them...   it is really  really strange. maybe its exactly a damage control after the backlash. I dont see any other logic. yet I dont believe that the direction of the game will be changed. it gives a lot of field for experimenting with these new group of tr. you know man tr  dwarf tr  elf tr  gender neutral tr etc.
new tomb raider blends itself too much with other gritty third person shooters. they need to bring back the bombastic high energy power fantasy of the og. bayonetta has that kind of energy and I cannot think of another female led game that matches it  bringing back og lara could do that for the western devs.
I would absolutely like if you played tomb raider 1 thourgh 4 in one seating  not necessarily a speedrun  but I guess it will be quick considering how much u have already played them.
loooool! the netflix cartoon is going to be trash
I also rebought all of the tomb raider games.  1 thru aod and legend thru underworld.  I grew up playing those games and wanted them back in my collection.  screw anything after underworld unless they go back to her roots.  at least revisit the legend storyline.
they should give the tomb raider to night dive studios to work some miracles when it comes to remasters as seen with toruk 1 2  shadow man and system shock 3 still in the pipeline.
is there something about the ps1 that makes it preferable to the ps2   feng shuI   I have one around here somewhere  haven t seen it in years since the ps2 covers the entire library and has its own vast selection.  and thats the last positive thing I ll say about a sony system.
I want a continuation of legacy of kain damn it. or what would be great is a remake of the first since its so dated now.
notice that cyristal dynamics stop the lara croft super models as well.
im also one of the ones who loved angel of darkness. it truely wasnt a classic tr game. but definitly a better try to mix the old gameplay kind of with a bunch of story. so it isnt just a mass murder life is strange like the reboot.I think tombraider shouldnt be completely storyless. I love lara to actually do something reasonable.but itshouldnt be the mainfocus and too linear   itshouldnt pander to anything politics related tho. becauss this literally kills the game and the joy.
I dont want to know how laura became who she is. I dont need a complete biography for my favorite characters. mystery is good  you can give me hints  little pieces that let me speculate  mystery is good. laura is a posh rich brit who got rich raiding ancient tombs. its just like samus  I dont need her whole backstory  I dont need a full bio. you wanna knock my socks off  show me how she originally met the chozo and got one of their ships and one of their armors. thats all I want to know about her  not who she was as a kid. mystery is good  you can drop hints  and make vague references inviting the audience to speculate  when did writers become talentless hacks that didn t realize this  isn t this creative writing 101.
personally  I dont think lara passing the mantle to a new generation is such a bad idea  just found out thatshe was born in 1968  which is kinda weird to think about   but I also think they are too enamored with the idea of her adventures always building up to something world ending  and that always creeps into ridiculous plots no one gives a shit about.
now is the best time to collect retro games. I got a tube tv for that reason  and I currently have an nes  snes  n64  ps1  ps2 and the first xbox. I wonthe n64 in an auction on ebay. I was the only person who bid on it  and I won it for 4 dollars! I got the xbox at a salvation army thrift store for 10 dollars.
I have a 30  tube tv just so I can play my nes and snes. I feel for you!
I also liked the ps1 tomb raider games  but my favorite is tomb raider anniversary.
crystal dynamics is owned by embracer as part of the deal from square enix. at least the western division of cd.
insert something from classic franchise here  is doa seems there s a lot of that going around. is there a franchise that hasn t been shat on by these crazy companies yet
rip  lara. we ll always have ps1.
I dunno about you but im excited for what they do with legacy of kain.
the last truly good non-remake remaster tr I played was the last revelation  the 4th one in the series!   after that one itstarted going downhill! I didn t really like chronicles  but it was nothing compared every subsequent game in the series! the anniversary remaster of og tr was the exception
I gotta ask  wouldn t it have been easier to just emulate these old tomb raider games rather than buying a whole system to stream them . but if you did it to avoid some legal issues with roms and such I can understand going through the effort.
you should have gotten a modded psx with hdmI output!
I dont get some of these companies  why would you want to change her from a bomb shell  to less  you should get yourself a raspberry pI to run roms  and emulators.
they need to bring the creator back.
it was all over the place and curtis sucked....the puzzles  and combat were ok it was the setting that ruined it...I dont want to be running around streets  its tomb raider were there should be ancient ruins and tombs..
Imade a video on that. but the deal wasn t in effect at the time of this video  it makes zero sense for crystal to call themselves owners either way
but if you did it to avoid some legal issues with roms and such I can understand going through the effort. she already own a disc version  she could put the disc in her computer and emulate the game without downloading roms
I really wanna play the new legacy of kain
this franchise is the definition of being taken by the wrong hands. they turned it into something its not and its being strayed further and further from what people enjoyed about it. so sad. now all we can look forward to is the fan remakes of the classics.
damn you square enix
do you think they mentioned legacy of kain because they re planning something
r.i.p. larasad boom
Im kinda hoping that other studios are going to cue in on this mess and make a new ip heavily inspired by the classics  akin to this https   www.youtube.com watch v _lskdg-g9py  .  tbh I dont even care if its lara croft anymore because the ip owners of tomb raider is not giving us what we want. there is clearly a market for it and I dont even know what s holding cd back on giving us that classic tr experience.
looks like embracer acquired crystal dynamics in may this year.
when I love something its you talking about tomb raider
embracer owns the studio who does darksiders   darksiders .. which gameplay wise is what tomb raider should be
tomb raider made me a rest of my life  rhona mitra fan
I also have an old heavy tube tv for the old games. emulation just never quite feels the same.
any of the franchises we grew up with I liken to being in high school and being asked to the prom by the hottest chick in school only to be told on the day of she has other plans and Im a loser and this repeats itself the entire time your in high school. you still get your hopes up when something new  like star wars  is coming out but eventually yourealize the prom queen s not going to the prom with me cause Im a loser.
knowing crystal dynamics they re going to keep ruining the franchise as they have since 2006. I love angel of darkness but I still respect your thoughts and spoke out of it on twitter. I know for one thing that I wont be giving them my money.
melonie  uhm.. Im more of a hitman fan than tomb raider  but my 1st introduction to tr is the legend trilogy because I do not have a console at that time so Ive played the legend trilogy on pc. and then the survivor trilogy with the last two on console. so.. is legend trilogy a poor series and the survivor trilogy  because I think the stories are pretty good for me. what s the diffirence from the classic series  is the legend series up to the survivor not canon to the classic series  oh btw speaking of old stuff  I still play the 2000s stuff and the newer ones I also not like that much. except for horizon fw.
hooray! public domain  here she comes!
you could just get a gaming pc and emulate a lot of those older games.its not that hard  and you wont have to buy 4-6 older and different consoles to do it.
Imiss the old lara so much she was a badass sexy confident women.the reboot made her look like a nice kid played all 3 games but didnt liked lara in them too much
if embracer doesnt give it to another studio then the next the next game will do to tomb raider what the new saints row game did to that franchise
I know Im late but hopefully that classic tr game on the old tv has been good!
for fudge sake! sigh........welp......it was nice knowing you tomb raider. it was fun while it lasted.
nah  they just mentioned lok and deus ex because they are popular properties of theirs. they ve been working on tomb raider after the avengers garbage  so I dont really see how such a small team would have the resources to work on other projects simultaneously
@melonie mac go boom  I was just thinking they ve already done the story for a new tomb raider  supposedly. so they could be working on a story for another project already. not that I want that  but it occurred to me when you posted your new game.
yes but the deal hasn t finalized yet
@melonie mac go boom  fingers crossed.  I didn t realize it was crystal  eidos  and square that embracer got for the 330 million.
and also that original soul reaver was one of the greatest games ever.
no reason to be sad  we still got the 5 classics
having rights isn t always having ownership of the ip  just the right to make stuff with the ip.  but this is.. different.what this translates to  is simple.embracer bought crystal dynamics from square. as well as eidos montreal and squares full montreal studio.it means they ve basically let cd off the reins to do whatever for the series. so its probably going to wind up like the legend anniv etc stuff. though maybe its just going to go more crap. we ll see.
girl  dont give me this black pill
hello  thanks for this video  but I didn t agree all what you were talking about. Im also a tomb raider player  I played tomb raider since 1996. what Im thinking about the classic lara croft is that   at the end of last century  with the limitation of the gaming technology  developer cant always make what they really wanted  at the time being  the lara croft is much more a character and less a human being  just like super mario  and the video game we play is much more like a entertainment and less a experience. but today  with the tech we have today  not just can we build photo realistic graphics  but also make video games a life-like experience  and shouldn t the lara croft to be advanced  we not just want our lara to be character  but also a fresh being  this means lara has to have her own emotions  her own personalities  and also her own weakness. I think dynamic crystal have their own consideration  and the recently reboot trilogy is not a failure but quite a success  because they make lara a real person  cant you just feel her  tough her and even like her  and what I saw from these games were lara through her own struggle to make herself finally succeeded  that is something. besides  what the classic lara croft you are talking about  is a superwoman lara croft  who has been a history forever  we cant bring her back  why not just let her stay that way  if somebody really like the classic lara  why not just play with the classic tomb raider  Im good that way. besides  these old title do have some issues running with modern hardware  but there are also trouble-shooting manuals online  please take a search if you need any help. I can run all the classic tomb raider titles on my pc  and play them with gamepad  and my experience have exceeded the original far more.
please make a tombraider playlist.
teaching a crew of tomb raiders  made me break out laughing its like one of the fn worst ideas Ive ever heard
well alllllllllllllllllriiiiiiiiighty-then.. guess ill fire up the ole phat ps3 and start from the beginning again. its just wow.. sadly I get eyehurt from tr 1 2   3..even with the mclassic upscaler from marceille! we so desperately need remasters on those   all the classics. thanks mel!
the reboot lara was the end of lara...
Ive played the rebooted tomb raider 1 I haven t played the other ones  but I thought the actual game and story was okay for what it was. but even I know its a far cry from what the tomb raider series and story is supposed to be.
well all good things must come to sad as hell
ps1 spyro and tomb raider   my childhood. tomb raider  anniversary is probably crystal s best tr imo.
wait melonie  you need a sony trinitron pvm-crt tv. thats what you need. best crt you can get and can do 480p progressive scan resolution
Im strongly agreed with every word. las week I started shadow and I just hate lara now. the franchise is dead. is not lara anymore  is not tomb raider anymore
would you like see a tombraider game being developed from the ground-up for the original original xbox hardware but with snes-fx chip graphics but actually taking advantage xbox frame rate and full color array and also ad lighting effects then imported to northern consoles for release  I bet xbox frame rate and color will  go a long way if the game had snes-fx graphics. what would the original series look like on the original xbox like
when they sold tomb raider back then  it was totally over. it happens to alot of games   movies. they make 1 - 4 games movies  then quit and hand it over to another team. we have to wait for the miracle. the next batman begins  the darknight   the darknight rises  for the next lara croft.
saints row reboot was proof some things are better off dead than ruined. I think lara croft is in the same boat. let her die true to herself than live a shadow of her former self.
I feel the same way about ghost recon. wildlands was so fun. it was gta for soldiers like me. breakpoint was a live service botch. the next one looks even worse.
my mind wanted to read the video title as  tomb raider is in doa   but alas...and embracer group bought the studios from se  not just the ip
Imiss classic lara...
tomb raider 2 on playstation 1 is top 5 favorites for myself  thanks
like I already said in this video though  square enix never limited crystal dynamics. they have always had free reign.I doubt cd would go back to an lau style after their aggressive reboot push. thats all cd s doing  not square.
I ll do that tomorrow  thank you for the suggestion
welcome to the club.
tomb raider needs a proper resurrection
this is sick  absolutely sick
good news  melonie snack is still a whole dime piece
crying out loud. cd cant just stop  fixing  things that ain t broke. now Im glad we haven t gotten anything from legacy of kain since 03  no nosgoth doesnt count  even though dead sun wasn t going to have anything to deal with the lok story or era Im glad its dead and not bastardized like tomb raider series has been.
are they gonna at least remaster the classic ps1   ps2 era lara croft
cristal dynamics used to be a great company  now its just a shadow of its former self.
I think its unrealistic to expect a ps1 like experience from a modern tomb raider game  when some of the mechanics were a result of technical limitations of the time. and this is coming from someone who grew up with these games. I think an anniversary style game is the best we can get. not as over the top as legend  had decent puzzles because it was based on the classics and also played like a new game. definitely not like the recent uncharted clones though.
love the new hairdo!
you know embracer  letting these types of folk do what they want to properties you ve invested in leads to things like saint s row.think about it. I certainly did not buy saint s row  and will not buy any tomb raider titles either until things change.
judging by thatstatue alone this is gonna be bad.
fans need to create our own game thats based of the original lara croft  change the name and that to avoid anything  then maybe people can see that  that type of character can be enjoyable also who else feels like the tombraider sub reddit is filled with loud reboot fans
if you load your wallet on the playstation network you can download good reliable copies of all the classic tomb raiders onto your ps3 and play them on that as well.
I agree old games are the way to go!
embracer group will just have to get out this dud before moving onto the tomb raider game fans actually want. this game has been in development a few years before embracer group came along I believe. so just gotta get it out  then move on.
luc besson ..he should direct a film
as long as crystal dynamics has tomb raider  we will never get classic lara back
melonie Im looking forward to any retro gaming you do. especially classic lara tr. melonie mac is the best!!!!!
but Im confused didn t they sell the franchise     how they own tomb raider
I ll wait til we actually see some gameplay
I got my money on the one white guy in her  team  actually being a bad guy.
a tomb raider game in the style of ghost of tsushima would be good I think.
so the new idea for the games is to play as inexperienced  tomb raiders  who are learning their way   isn t that exactly what we have had to suffer through for the last 3 games   when we were promised a trilogy showing the origin and evolution of the tomb raider but instead got 3 whole games of insecurity and self-doubt from lara.
oof the only part thatsucks about getting into retro game collecting is that nows the worst time for it. its more expensive than ever with losers trying to get rich. good luck though  its doable
bad or not at least there were tomb raider games. I just wanna see a new soul reaver game.
cd were brought from square as well as the rights to tr
tomb raider is dead because the culture of game development is incapable of making a tomb raider game anymore. all they can do is create another woke monstrosity and slap the  tomb raider  name on it. I d rather have nothing at all.
they should honestly give lara to naughty dog or insomniac at least they know how to treat there legacy franchises
maybe they actually bought crystal.
you need to make an 80s pop rock video with that big hair like the bangles
fuuuuuuuck. all I want is another brutally difficult tr3.
I do in fact know how appreciative I am thatsamus aran has been preserved as designed since 1986. she is still samus aran regardless if its metroid classic or metroid prime.
woke mob is anti-midas team  they have a game with actual strong independent woman in it - and yet they managed to destroy even that!
that thumbnail pic...is that jj the jetplane
this game character was originally invented in derby and we have a road named lara croft way. since she was old off the character has done nothing but go downhill and become a laughing stock instead of an icon.
I keep hoping making money will restore sense in these companies. where s the 1  when we need them
hollywood and gaming absolutely hate pretty influential women that dont put their politics first.
I guess cd are happy to keep making games that are only relevant in pc benchmark videos. seriously thats the only type of use Ive seen tomb raider in the last decade I didn t realize for years they were making new games thought there were over like in 2008
playlist suggestion  tomb raider news
of course cd hates classic lara  she was the brainchild of adrian and jeremy smith not toby gard. in fact  toby always hated the character.
plaayy station 1. I didn t ever play it on there I  played it on pc and had the box. old pc games were the best because the boxes they came in were huge! especially the tomb raider ones haha
nd already has uncharted with chloe fraser being of the character to carry the series forward. insomniac got their hands full with growing spider-man series and now wolverine.
yeah but samus was never known for her sex appeal. so nintendo lucked out there.
here s the solution to bring back lara run the classics thru unreal engine  slightly clean up the controls  and make ports to current consoles. at this point tomb raider needs to be in the hands of an indie company bc at this point indie company s make better games that these big company s. I dont gaf abt how good new games look I j dont care. gameplays more important. maybe crystal should sign a deal with core design and let them be in charge. core design had passion for tomb raider.
resident evil 1 on the psx is also timeless.
53 days til  halloween
I see people are saying   they re marketing to people who dont play games.   but the real problem in the video game industry is game developers want to do cgI animated films while having no clue about the history of their ips.   they are not trying to replace their customer base for another like marvel  they are just being ignorant of their craft.
level 3 google-fu  press release   may 2  2022   08 00embracer group enters into an agreement to acquire eidos  crystal dynamics  and square enix montr al amongst other assets
crystal dynamics is planning on ruining the next perfect dark game and turning joanna dark into another feminist lara croft  no joke.
I am starting to lose confidence in anything under the embracer group. I was a fan of their hands off approach  allowing their studios creative liberties. between this and the new saint s row game  its clearly too far hands off. instead of making games for the core fans  they keep pandering to niche groups and producing watered down milque toast uninspired content.
r.i.p laura cruz
it will suck  but not because of the premise. the idea of lara becoming a surrogate mother figure to a young companion and going on an adventure with them  both of them changing each other as they endure hardships together  could actually be quite interesting and could show a human side to lara without removing her sigma energy from the originals. kinda like God of war 4 did with kratos. I doubt they ll tell a meaningful story about adoptive motherhood and how it changes a person  but the idea of it is actually quite interesting. they could even tie it into an artefact related to the virgin mary and have motherhood be a thematic throughline in the plot.
I see youre starting to post more
I personally did not like tr3  what made no sense at all that after being able to save anywhere at anytime in tr2  tr3 goes right back to the save crystal idea. most modern games now feature most often the dreaded  check points  which are not well placed and not really welcome. you should be able to save anywhere and at any time in a game. there was not really much of tombs to explore in tr3. then tr4 came along  the egyptian theme was a good idea  but other things were not. after that is where tomb raider started to just go in a direction that no one wanted or even ever asked for. I truly and sincerely wish I could do computer programing  as I would truly stay true to classic lara and any other old games  they are the best. everyone is right  modern games these days are nothing like what gaming once used to be and still should be  but that is my humble opinion. I tried the 1st reboot game and instantly did not like it  taking away lara s dual pistols was the worst idea ever and it just got far worse after that. if tomb raider gets another reboot  it certainly will be so beyond recognition   that no one will like it.
did the last tomb raider game even sell well at all. I didn t think it did but I could be totally wrong. its ridiculous a studio that hates tomb raider are the ones making the game.
not enough butter in this video
I dont know what to say. my hope s not gone yet. I will never acept this new version of croft as the tomb raider I know. whatever cd is cooking  they better not stick to their own plans  but listen to the fans! otherwise it will be the darkest days for a classic tr fan and I dont want to believe that! I dont want this franchise to be a victim of this woke sh  ! I dont want to play a normal being lara croft who have no strong abilites and makes her unique. I dont want lara croft to cry all the time  I dont want to be disturbed by characters like jonah  zip and allister. just give her back what you ve stolen from her when you decided to reboot the franchise and I will promise you guys - most of the new generation fans will also love the classic lara croft for what you is! she simply kicks ass! imagine that classic lara croft with all the new graphics and possibilities. that cant go wrong!@melonie mac go boom - if a subscriber makes a donation  I would appreciate that and say  thank you ! otherwise you lose thatsubscriber. just saying!
john carmack - story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. its expected to be there  but its not that important.  gaming studios need to go back to video games and not story telling.
fans have been begging for truthful classic remakes or remasters for years now. this just shows crystal dynamics doesnt give two flies about tomb raider other than pushing their own garbage agenda. they have made 6  games and they still dont know who lara is or what a true organic tomb raider experience is. I dont expect anything good coming out in the future as long as they are involved.
gotta admit I liked the grit of the newer games  but in terms of character  lara fell flat on her arse
seems like eventually they d run out of tombs to raid.
bad news the company that kept lara  classic  before square enix bought the company is now in charge of tomb raider again.  reeeeeee!
melonie comes with the top teir bassed takes  ps1 tomb raider is tomb raider to me
current crystal dynamics dont know how to do compelling gameplay  only overdramatic cinematics
@melonie mac go boom  I thought I was replying to a comment.   not getting the z s is embarrassing.
yeah  never was fond of  check point saves  only myself and I detest them at every turn. being able to manually save became really rare in gaming after 2008. but  there s been a slight resurgence after 2017  with accessing typewriters  crystals  etc.. becoming fairly common again  but the  save anywhere at anytime  still remains almost exclusive to role-playing and strategy games. even now only a handful of action-adventure-horror games provide the time honored manual save option  and most just use the dreadful  check point saves  only. its become a deal breaker for me when it comes to searching and playing games now.
@mr. sinjin-smyth  I so agree with you and I am glad not to be the only person to dislike  check point saves.  I honestly thought I was alone on that one  as you said  because they are used so often now in most new games. its a deal breaker for me too if a game has  check point saves only.  do you find them to be misplaced too  like half way back before you need to do a really difficult part in the game to only have to go right back to that last  check point.  instead of being able to save exactly where you got up to. they may have been improved the check point saves.  since my time of using them  even if that is so. I still prefer to be able to save anywhere at any time during game play. its really essential.
@amy sadler  I too find check point saves poorly placed frequently and often lose lots of progress when exiting a game due not knowing when the next one will be triggered. it can never substitute manual saving in either the save point style  typewriters  crystals  etc...  or the much better save anytime anywhere. auto-saving should at best be utilized alongside a manual save option. for any game that uses auto-saving only is when I give that game a pass. my reason for detesting check point saves only is even more personal  because I always enjoy revisiting important moments  events of a game s story and check point auto-saving can never give me such pleasure. certain games with good stories or quite fun such as bioshock infinite  bionic commando  dark void  binary domain  splinler cell conviction  alan wake  re5  re6  lost planet 3  dead space 3  jedI fallen order  control  etc... didn t have any long lasting appeal for me thanks to having auto-saves only. then there are the games that utilize only one save slot  like dead rising 3  dragon s dogma  and death stranding  equally less appealing. when I look out for games now  gotta make sure there s manual saving and multiple save slots.  -
odd since he hired a hollywood writer to write for doom3  one of the most generic sci-fI story-lines ever....
I would rather see it doa then to have something that  it isn t . I dont want to see empty shell of a game like ea did to mass effect
to be honest I would rather the studios put out nothing at all than a piece of woke garbage. woke stuff isn t selling and maybe  just maybe  some of the studios are starting to realize that.
melonie I didn t know lara croft is gonna be a guest character in dead or alive xtreme beach volleyball this is a joke melonie
I love the survivor trilogy the most  honestly. would hope they continue that
after mr.toby gard leave  right after underworld ...they rebooting tr games there s something I did not recognize didn t even bother  I know it they going change her story too fact they dont want lara to be alone   remember they are new developer since the reboot who is inspired uncharted game.. and who never play tr classic from ps1 so sad..really..sad..they also forget it the past tr legend trilogy too  and this is why I dont like tr reboot cause I know they going to change it..damn you crystal dynamics
the reboot s character is not lara. I call her boreen because a toaster is more fun and likable than her. I despise boreen and that last thing I want is more of her whining because she is lonely. boreen will whine in the game and her motivations will be to go tomb raiding to make new friends. poor boreen. medipacks will be replaced by anti-depressants in the new game  and boreen will probably ruin the  suspense  by giving us the solutions to puzzles a 3 year old can solve. boreen is just boring that way.
legacy of kain is far more interesting than tomb raider. would rather see that come back.
tomb raider should be way  way bigger than uncharted  but it is in the wrong hands.
I never get why you dont like the ps2 tomb raider games that much they seem fun to me and they still have that classic lara feel.
broken link in your bio. maybe needs a new line
loved the survivor trilogy myself  but I wish it d had a more unifying story between each entry. very little confidence in the future of the ip right now . . . but tomb raider has had low points before and always come back.
am Imistaken  but you dont look old enough to have played the old tomb raider games as they came out  I played them and am in my 40s now. if you had experienced my disappointment at playing the angel of darkness on ps2 after enjoying most of the ps1 games then I think you d be more grateful that crystal dynamics rescued and modernised the controls at the very least. itseemed to me that the original games burned themselves out back in the day  through no fault of crystal dynamics. if they were that good the original games and storyline would still be going and built upon today with their original owners developers. you seem down on tomb raider in your video s despite it being nowhere near as bad as it has been in past games like tr chronicles and angel of darkness. Im just glad we ve moved past the original games story because the original did already get remade in anniversary. did they not recapture ps1 lara in that game  the only thing missing was tank controls if I remember. I play a lot of gaming franchises so maybe Im missing something
did you go see the 5 finger death punch and megadeth tour
rise of the tomb raider was an abomination  they basically had lara dressed up as a muppet through the entire game  forget  sexy  outfits  she didn t even have any outfits that wouldn t give a person heat stroke in an hour just walking through the jungle  never mind jumping fighting across ancient tombs.the quest for  woke lara  is totally immersion breaking.   if the future carries on anything like what crystal dynamics has done recently then the new game wont even be worth playing.
sony trinitron televisions and original hardware and physical games     3
the reboot onward is when we ve really really seen it just transform into something entirely different thats completely unrecognizable to what tomb raider is. again  what is the problem  is the legend of zelda still making 8-bit top-down collectathons starring a green elf or has it moved on to something the market s going to want this day   age
gross.  the last 3 tr games were actually super good  I would have been looking foward to a new game
they put the tomb out of tomb raider
classic tomb raider always felt a little ... one dimensional.
you said for aod fans to come at you so here I come! lmfao nah your points are fair that one I just give a pass for w.e. reason.
if only!
I went over this on another video. they re watered down playskool versions of tomb raider. heavily babied up and simplified  void of all the exploration  platforming  and puzzle challenge of the classic games. not to mention the annoyance of zip and alistar  and the change in lara croft s backstory and motivations.
@melonie mac go boom  finally someone said it  all of this was my problem in lau trilogy  even though tr2 and legend were my first tr games  but when I disliked it people say  I dont understand that lara got resureccted  which I dont even care- sure  lau did ressurect lara but if chronicles and aod understandably got flak then why we cant mention that underworld had camera bug issues and legend had that nonstop talking of lara s helpers  qte and the racetrack-like level design a la point a- point b with obvious puzzles to solve
thats the thing  you cant unify 3 vastly different characters who happen to share the same name. they either need to commit to their own new lara fully or go back to the roots imo. I d rather have no attempt at all than a bad one
@melonie mac go boom  fair enough. the different laras are pretty dissimilar  not bad  but kinda to  unify  them into one. I d rather they stick with the survivor lara myself  but again  I liked those entries far more than the older games.
ur right I played them when they originally released as well and Imentioned they are from that era...the controls are not accurate anymore and lara is very bland as a character...but I will say that back then there was no other games like that...
@jack straw  I wouldn t want an eco warrior lesbian lara croft that goes around trying to save artefacts ether  because thats kind of the opposite of what tomb raiding is about. but so far crystal dynamics haven t done that. if they do though I ll be among the first in line to complain. personally I enjoy the mostly solitary experience of exploring tombs nathan drake or indiana jones esqe.
modern legend of zelda still has its identity present even though it has adapted to modern trends.
@charming peasant  how doesnt tomb raider
not even remotely a comparable scenario. the modern zelda games still respect the source lore  characters  and gameplay fundamentals
@melonie mac go boom  in the  source lore   link was left-handed and wore a green outfit  impa was an old lady    new age technology didn t exist.
first one was good  2nd was ok ... third was passable  but was the most meh of them all. but  yea- on a lara front the new games had her be more than a female mix of bond and indiana jones. it is weird  original lara was far more over the top girl power vs the newer one who was a kat from hunger games clone. people aren t fond of change  it is natural- even if that change isn t something offensively gross like what was done to star trek  lotr or star wars.
good games  but not tomb raider games
aod fans have thick skin like lara  even my worst criticisms against aod has never triggered outrage from y all. unlike reboot stans lol!
@melonie mac go boom  oh big facts. my friends keep trying to get me to stream the new trilogy since I couldn t finish it all since I hate it tbh and they think me rage playing it will be funny but idw those hordes to come for me hahaha
@melonie mac go boom     tomb raider is now doomed raider.
@8 37 r.i.p tomb raider - I want to see you playing on your tube t.v. enjoying your video game on a ps1 - nice ! - God bless you   your channel - ok beautiful woman its one of america s favorite gamer joeyg dat1dude - I like retro gaming. and I will be posting a ps3 on mercarIvery soon - cleaning it up right now.
embracer group owns tr because embracer group bought crystal dynamics from square enix.
love your hair today
who needs the gym when you can move tube tvs
damn melonie trina fight every tomb raider fan from ps2 and on lol melonie is like come at me bro
that tr4 thumbnail... oooof
bro I want to play the old ones
buying i. p. to kill it off
battlefieldhalosaints rowgears of wartomb raidermass effect etc.so many franchises are being mishandled.
Im sure anita sarkeeson is behind this downfall.
should have at least a ps2.
trpsx ftw
its like they all want to be movie directors instead of game makers. keep itsimple and get over yourselves.
next on tomb raider   lara croft is swapped to be a black asian half-elf paraplegic transitioning lesbian man.
I ll just stick with the old tomb raider content from legends and original.
I would love if some yokotaru takes over the tomb raider while working with crystal dynamics because that man is ahead of all his games and Imean look at nier automata is a hella of a game and is sexualized a lot  also have blood and all the killing. because I like the new tomb raider because how good I looks but their history is sooooooo boring.
I dont give a crap about the storyline. I care whether or not they use unreal engine 5 and make tomb raider look like that ue5 demo with the cave  lights  flying and bats.

thats the way things should be put  but instead crystal dymanics has gone and said all this
bahaha! I cant recall a single time an aod fan was offended by me though  even through my harshest criticisms. they re built tougher and can handle a disagreement without a meltdown lol!
@melonie mac go boom  they just know you will lay the smackdown no need to be modest lol
those who know  know lol
they re more concerned with telling their stories than making good games and good characters.
haha
america did this! it was yoooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
see  its jealousy
nice hair!
it hasn t been a good game since number 1. this is no great loss. no more verse of the day mel  thats kinda sad.
I agree the ps1 games were the best
oof
nice bed-head  mac.
why would they do lara like that.  I love tomb raider.  I hate all these changes that all these companies are making.  lara croft is an iconic character in the gaming industry.  leave her alone !!!!!!!!!!
teacher tomb raider.... hard pass.
savages!!!!!!!
where is your evidence that  tomb raider is doa
where are you posting these days
why is itso hard to make a simple puzzle adventure action game  no one cares about the story  just make a good game lol
so is lara croft going to be teacher a young lesbian tomb raider to then pass the torch to a more progressive character  itseems to be the trend for every other character maybe even a female one this time lol
this new tomb raider game will not sell... no fan of tomb raider wants it. it will bomb.
ummm.. well. crystal dynamics made tomb raider legend all the other games that came after it. it was the last faithful iteration of tomb raider. then this new version took over and is now hopefully dead. maybe with crystal dynamics back  they can bring that old tomb raider back   I guess not  I hope so because I am tired of this photorealistic tomb raider.
I dont get it. why ps1  honestly  steam version is just fine. you can even install a fix to get it 16 9.
I think classic tomb raider games are dead..and there is no hope for them coming back  I think we need to accept that fact and move onwe are lucky enough to have these 5 classic games on ps1 to enjoy forever
it is exeptional for something to stay fresh for a long time so its no wounder tomb raider has worn out its wellcome by basicly staying the same.I have no interest in lara or the game any more its a limited concept for a game.
I dont play a lot of games any more there all crap and broken. there all the same copying from one another but using a different skin and the visuals just get s worst and plays bad for the price we pay for our pc and graphics cards for a broken game all the time
is that her with straight hair in the thumb nail  do you know by any chance
its not bedhead  thats fresh hair out of the shower lol  thats just how wavy  curly hair works
@melonie mac go boom  mhm.  I wouldn t know  I have perfectly straight ginger hair.
twitter  instagram stories  and here mostly
crystal dynamics will burn down like how volition did. volition was cocky about the new saints row reboot. disrespecting fans on twitter now look at them had to move into gearbox because of the huge failure.
tomb raider should be a license to print money. what a cluster f  you got to love ps1 games because they released finished product.
if anyone wants to play ps1 tomb raider games  all ps3 consoles are backwards compatible with ps1 discs. have fun. I love old school games
well. another franchise to add to dumpster fire. legacy of kain is next. to live this long and watch every gaming franchise you once love turn to dust...u can only laugh to hide the pain
not surprise if crystal dynamics going to turn lara croft into a dude.
yeah thatsound awful.
I will never buy another tomb raider game until they bring back classic lara croft.  keep the woke bs out of video games.
there are fans of aod
how doz it fel t liv long enuf t see all ur belovd ipz turn t crap
too posh   misogynistic  unrelatable   am I playing a different game   based on what exactly these comments   people are hating on the last 3 tomb raiders just because are different easy to do so while someone tried his-her best to give you something out of this game
also  no verse of the day. disliked.
ah lara croft changing is bad  its called a character development  no one wants to be a loner forever and will need help eventually completeing a goal
surprisingly aod has a decent cult following of peeps who that is their fav game haha
I am one of them!
its sobering.
